1
00:00:00,993 --> 00:00:01,713

3
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:07,194
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:08,034
Councilor Behrs.

5
00:00:08,054 --> 00:00:08,414
Present.

Present.

8
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:10,795
Vice President Knight.

9
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:11,155
Present.

10
00:00:11,235 --> 00:00:11,755
Councilor Martins.

11
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:12,515
Present.

12
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:13,255
Councilor Morrell.

13
00:00:13,495 --> 00:00:13,815
Present.

14
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:14,735
Councilor Scarpelli.

15
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:15,196
Present.

16
00:00:15,296 --> 00:00:16,576
President Caravaglia.

17
00:00:16,936 --> 00:00:17,276
Present.

18
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:18,816
Please rise and assume the flag.

19
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:29,118
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:42,579
Before we start the meeting tonight, tonight's the last night for our TV station manager, Pat Gordon.

21
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:49,841
And Pat, we just want to thank you for your service for all the years and the time it's ours.

22
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:53,383
So congratulations and good luck on your new position.

23
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:56,383
Councilor Moxley, do you want to?

24
00:00:56,883 --> 00:00:57,824
Yes, Mr. President.

25
00:00:57,844 --> 00:00:59,285
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

26
00:01:00,246 --> 00:01:06,431
Patrick Gordon has been an instrumental part of this team since he came on with the city.

27
00:01:06,892 --> 00:01:22,025
And in particular, Mr. President, over the 18 or so months of the pandemic, Patrick was the one that brought us into the 21st century, allowing us to communicate with our constituents that were unable to attend meetings during the pandemic.

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,223
And he was instrumental in bringing up Zoom for us, not only for the council meeting, but many other public meetings in this city.

29
00:01:30,904 --> 00:01:37,807
And I credit him, actually, for having us keep open government during the pandemic.

30
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:40,368
And I wish him well in his new endeavors.

31
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:43,630
And hopefully, at some point, we'll see him again, Mr. President.

32
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:46,796
Thank you, Mr. President.

33
00:01:47,436 --> 00:02:09,389
I mean, I'm scared to say nice things because I don't want to see you go, but yeah, to echo Councilor Marks, just the work you always do is tremendous, but the work you did, particularly during the pandemic to get us dialed in from home in the chambers, allowing the public to engage, you know, doing that with your own equipment and really kind of bootstrapping to get this a really successful system, I think speaks volumes to just how you operate and have operated since you've been here.

34
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:14,653
So you will be sorely missed and I thank you for your years of just excellent service to the city and to the council.

35
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:17,206
Councilor Tocco.

36
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,287
Thank you, Mr. President, Patrick.

37
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:19,547
Thank you so much for all your hard work.

38
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:29,350
Last year when I was president, we were going through this together and I called you on a regular basis just to make sure that all the technology was working fine.

39
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,552
And we made that transition from Zoom back into the council chambers.

40
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:37,832
You were instrumental, be humble, leave.

41
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:41,854
I know it took you many hours to test everything out and to get it working.

42
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:44,693
it was, it was seamless.

43
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:49,174
We came back, you had everything going, everything working absolutely to perfection.

44
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,475
And I can't thank you enough for that.

45
00:02:51,555 --> 00:03:01,239
And for all of the hours that you've put in in the past year, year and a half, I know you've been working nonstop, not just with our meetings, but with all of the municipal meetings.

46
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:03,060
So thank you so much for all your hard work.

47
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:08,182
Congratulations, good luck, best wishes, and thank you for all your hard work.

48
00:03:08,262 --> 00:03:08,663
Thank you.

49
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,445
Pat, I'm going to be very sad to see you go.

50
00:03:12,465 --> 00:03:18,769
We've had a lot of laughs over the past couple of years, and I'm very grateful that you came and took over TV3.

51
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,051
It's been quite a run for you, brother.

52
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:25,994
You've put in a ton of hours, overworked and underpaid, and I'm very sad to see you go.

53
00:03:26,114 --> 00:03:31,637
You've done an excellent job for us here at MedFed, and you've really helped bring us to the 21st century, so thank you very much for all you've done.

54
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:37,681
I wish you the best of luck over in Everett, and I hope you don't recommend them to steal anybody else from us over here.

55
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:39,438
Councilor Baez.

56
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,960
Thank you, Mr. President and Patrick.

57
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:57,714
I mean, I don't think we can say enough about how far above and beyond you've gone in your entire service, you know, running community media for an entire community by yourself, you know, up until just a few months ago, I think, and what you've done for us in the pandemic.

58
00:03:57,774 --> 00:04:01,897
And personally, I can't thank you enough for making me look good on camera.

59
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:04,960
So I really look forward to seeing what you can do.

60
00:04:05,642 --> 00:04:10,003
and hopefully building a budget that could attract someone like you back here in the future.

61
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:22,368
Uh, Pat, uh, this is, uh, it's bittersweet because, uh, you know, you went through a tough time with all of us and, uh, it was your leadership that pulled us through.

62
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:25,028
So I don't think people realize how much you did do.

63
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:26,769
Um, I know that

64
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:34,220
when you're talking about a position where it takes you away from your family, you, you know, you, you see some people get bitter and angry.

65
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,562
I've never, ever saw that in you at all.

66
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:51,056
Um, I'd see you on a Tuesday after a marathon session, the school committee, and then thinking that we have a marathon session on Tuesday and thinking your week's done, but no, you have to do another committee meeting on a Wednesday and you're a one man team.

67
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:51,256
So

68
00:04:52,677 --> 00:04:57,140
No wonder why other communities came in and tried to scoop you up and why you're leaving.

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:08,109
So it hurts that you are leaving, but, you know, you took a lot of junk from a lot of ignorant people that you had to deal with and listen to that stuff.

70
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:16,215
But I just warned you, yeah, we had the flyby, it was supposed to start, and then the flyby.

71
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:18,617
So all I want to, let it be saying that,

72
00:05:19,377 --> 00:05:22,098
Thank you, congratulations for all your hard work here.

73
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:25,138
It's something that you set Medford on a great track.

74
00:05:25,838 --> 00:05:29,619
The award you received, I think, is something we'll never forget.

75
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:34,040
Thanks to you, and have a great time in the neighboring community.

76
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:34,960
Thank you very much.

77
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,081
Again, on behalf of all my colleagues and everyone at the City of Medford, thank you again.

78
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:43,942
During some tough times, you kept us together and kept the show on the road again.

79
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:47,923
Good luck in your new position, and hopefully we can hire so many

80
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,841
of equal talent of you.

81
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,903
Thank you very much, Mr President.

82
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:56,267
Just just if I could customize on I've stated this on many occasions.

83
00:05:56,707 --> 00:06:00,971
The city of method charges a 5% fee on cable bills.

84
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:09,834
And that 5% fee is a franchise fee that's supposed to go to PEG access, which is public education and government channel.

85
00:06:10,494 --> 00:06:18,583
Only 2% of the fee goes back into providing local programs, educational programs, and government access, Mr. President.

86
00:06:18,903 --> 00:06:21,845
The rest, the 3%, goes into the general office.

87
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:36,593
And I think what we're seeing, Mr. President, this has nothing to do with Patrick, what we're seeing is a sorely underfunded PEG local access station, you know, not similar to other communities that have a large office with multiple employees.

88
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:41,536
But here we are with one employee and an assistant, Mr. President,

89
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:45,444
which just is not enough to run a peg access in our community.

90
00:06:45,484 --> 00:06:53,389
So I respectfully ask once again, that this be looked at by the city administration and fully fund peg access.

91
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,831
So the residents can reap the benefits, Mr. President.

92
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:58,973
Thank you very much.

93
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:03,696
I want to admit that I just came tonight because I thought we were getting fed again.

94
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:05,457
It's not a budget meeting, I guess.

95
00:07:09,123 --> 00:07:10,765
It's been an absolute pleasure working with all of you.

96
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:18,453
Um, there's obviously differences in politics and opinions, but it's quite obvious that you all have this city's best interest in mind.

97
00:07:18,513 --> 00:07:22,136
And it's, it's pretty clear every week seeing that, you know, work play itself out.

98
00:07:22,176 --> 00:07:22,977
So thank you very much.

99
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:24,038
Thank you.

100
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:24,398
Thank you.

101
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:24,899
Good luck.

102
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,460
Good luck.

103
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,663
Hey, uh, vice president night.

104
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:34,180
A motion to suspend the rules to take several papers out of order, Mr. President.

105
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:38,805
On the motion by Vice President Knight to take papers out of order, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

106
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,526
All those in favor?

107
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:40,047
Aye.

108
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:40,728
Opposed?

109
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:41,488
Motion passes.

110
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,812
Paper 21431, Mr. President, a common victuals license.

111
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:47,415
Which one was it? 21431.

112
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:57,466
2-1, petitions, presentations and similar papers.

113
00:07:57,486 --> 00:08:09,476
2-1-4-3-1, petition for a common fixture license for Calwind Management doing business as Town Place Suites slash Fairfield Inn Suites, 85 Station Landing, Medford, Mass.

114
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:15,881
Do we have anybody from Calwind Management here on the call?

115
00:08:19,705 --> 00:08:21,046
Anybody from Calwind Management on the call?

116
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:29,339
Maria Costa, Marcy Costa, where are you?

117
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:32,421
Marcy Costa, as a clerk, can you unmute Marcy, please?

118
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:39,807
Can you all hear me?

119
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:41,348
Yes, Marcy.

120
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:44,431
Are you here representing town, please?

121
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:46,552
I am, Mr. President.

122
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:46,873
Thank you.

123
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:51,896
Marcy Costa from McDermott, Colty, and Miller at 28 State Street in Boston, Massachusetts, on behalf of the applicant.

124
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:53,758
OK.

125
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,412
Licensing Chairman, Councilor Scott Pelley.

126
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:58,694
Thank you, Mr. President.

127
00:08:58,994 --> 00:09:13,284
Now, this is for a petition for a conflict license at Stacey's Landing for Tower Place Suites, Fairfax.

128
00:09:13,304 --> 00:09:19,047
Mr. President, do any of my colleagues have any comments or questions before I recommend approval?

129
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:21,993
Vice President, a couple things.

130
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:24,334
First of all, Mr President review of the application.

131
00:09:24,354 --> 00:09:29,396
It appears that this entity has the ability to employ over 100 full of part time employees.

132
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:31,957
So this seems like this will be something that's a great addition to our community.

133
00:09:32,878 --> 00:09:37,120
However, in looking at the application, the petition does seek hours from six a.m.

134
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:37,620
to one a.m.

135
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,822
And that would, I believe, require them to petition this council at a later date for an extended hours permit.

136
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:43,843
That's correct.

137
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:50,157
The 11 o'clock would be the latest closing time.

138
00:09:51,178 --> 00:09:56,862
Under the current permit, you'd have to come back for a special permit for extended hours.

139
00:09:56,882 --> 00:09:58,263
7 to 11, I think.

140
00:09:58,303 --> 00:10:00,285
Yeah, the normal permit is 7 to 11.

141
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:02,687
Excellent, not a problem.

142
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:08,151
We'll be sure to complete all the necessary paperwork and come back before you for that extended permit request.

143
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:12,014
He'll give you the process to apply for the extended hours.

144
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:14,676
Any further questions on this?

145
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:16,217
Councillor Morrell.

146
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:20,078
It just says on the Board of Health paper that it will be inspected on 6921.

147
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:23,659
So I just don't know if we have a missing an update in here on that.

148
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:28,200
Or we'll get an update at some point.

149
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,501
I'm just noting at the Board of Health document says it will be inspected on 6921, which is now in the past.

150
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:35,041
So I just don't know if there's an update on that.

151
00:10:37,922 --> 00:10:38,722
Any further questions?

152
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:40,503
Council Members?

153
00:10:41,663 --> 00:10:42,163
On this paper?

154
00:10:42,763 --> 00:10:42,863
No.

155
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:52,130
On the motion by Councilor Scott Felly, seconded by Vice President Night.

156
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,190
Clerk, please call the roll.

157
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:05,554
Councilor Bears?

158
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:05,994
Yes.

159
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:07,094
Councilor Falco?

160
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:08,595
Yes.

161
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:09,775
Vice President Night?

162
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,075
Yes.

163
00:11:10,375 --> 00:11:10,916
Councilor Marks?

164
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:11,476
Yes.

165
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:12,216
Councilor Morrell?

166
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:12,576
Yes.

167
00:11:12,936 --> 00:11:13,656
Councilor Scott Felly?

168
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:14,397
Yes.

169
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:18,707
Yes, second affirmative, negative motion passes.

170
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:20,008
2-1.

171
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:35,650
2-1, hold on a second.

172
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:43,332
2-1, motion to take paper 2-1, 3-8-1 from the table by Vice President Knight.

173
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:44,532
Second and by.

174
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,001
Seconded by Councilor Behrs.

175
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:47,741
All those in favor?

176
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:49,763
All opposed?

177
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,144
Motion passes.

178
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:54,427
Vice President Layton.

179
00:11:54,447 --> 00:12:00,972
This was a paper that was tabled a couple of weeks ago at my request as I was seeking a double pole to be removed from Burgadave.

180
00:12:00,992 --> 00:12:07,998
This paper was requesting a grant location to access the Greenland extension to provide certain services from Verizon.

181
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:14,823
Double pole has been removed and I'd like to thank my friends at Verizon and their Comcast for the work that they did in making sure that that happened expediently.

182
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:17,563
Last week, I forgot to take this off the table.

183
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,904
The president put it up for a vote.

184
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:21,525
So I'd ask my colleagues to stay in the paper this evening.

185
00:12:21,786 --> 00:12:30,512
I do believe we have Karen Levesque that's going to be joining us from Verizon on the call.

186
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:32,113
Richard Foreman, where are you?

187
00:12:32,693 --> 00:12:33,654
Are you here from Verizon?

188
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:36,396
Mr. Clerk, can you unmute Mr. Foreman?

189
00:12:36,676 --> 00:12:37,517
Good evening, Mr. Foreman.

190
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:38,778
Are you here from Verizon?

191
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:40,099
Yes, I am, sir.

192
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:40,819
Good evening.

193
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:41,940
How are you?

194
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:52,045
Mr. President, this is the paper that would provide access to the Greenland extension for certain public utility services.

195
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:54,846
There's a lot of work that's going on in that area right now.

196
00:12:54,906 --> 00:13:02,188
I do believe resurfacing plans are on file with the city engineer's office, and I certainly have no problem with the petition and move for approval of the paper.

197
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:08,429
On the motion by Vice President May for approval, seconded by second by Councilor Baez.

198
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:09,290
Any more discussion?

199
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,090
All those in favor?

200
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:11,410
Aye.

201
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,270
All those opposed?

202
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:13,431
This is present.

203
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:14,291
Motion passes.

204
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,851
President Scott Pelley.

205
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:17,672
We while we're on this bench and paper 21432.

206
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:17,672
21432.

207
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:25,636
Regards to College Avenue, Medford, approval of easement to Tufts University.

208
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:37,984
Hold on, hold on.

209
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:38,984
One at a time.

210
00:13:39,004 --> 00:13:42,466
Okay, 21432 to President Caravaggio and all honorable members of the Memphis City Council.

211
00:13:42,626 --> 00:13:43,907
Mr. President, members of the council,

212
00:13:44,516 --> 00:14:12,220
I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body, pursuant to provisions of General Law, Chapter 40, Section 3, approve and authorize the grant of an easement to Tufts University, extending its perpetual exclusive right in, under, on, and over the easement area for the purpose of maintaining and utilizing the plaza for access to the new Cummings Center building being constructed on Tufts property

213
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:20,023
for access to other parts of the Tufts campus, for a seating area, a gathering place, and for a university activity.

214
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:29,825
The easement will allow Tufts to construct a system to provide for telecommunications, distribution cables, and to serve campus needs.

215
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:36,606
For your information, I am submitting a copy of the document containing the strength of easement along with the plan setting forth the area.

216
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:40,967
Representatives from Tufts will be in attendance at the council meeting

217
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:45,131
to answer questions, especially submitted on Mayor Graham of the grant.

218
00:14:46,131 --> 00:14:49,834
Good evening, Mr. Abruzzi, are you here from Tufts University?

219
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:53,116
Mr. Clark, can you unmute Mr. Abruzzi?

220
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,421
Good evening, Mr. President.

221
00:15:01,782 --> 00:15:02,722
Thank you, Mr. President.

222
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:03,623
Robert Abruzzi.

223
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:13,759
Attorney here on behalf of Tufts University with me is also Rocco DiRico and Ruthie Bennett from the university, the project director.

224
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:22,643
So we're here tonight seeking the council's approval of an easement in connection with the university's Cummings Center project on College Avenue.

225
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:33,468
More specifically, the grant of this easement will allow for a more aesthetically pleasing transition between the

226
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:40,663
Plaza, which is in front of the coming center and the College Avenue sidewalk below.

227
00:15:41,585 --> 00:15:46,993
As you know, there's a quite a great gradient variation in that area.

228
00:15:50,564 --> 00:16:00,333
The limits and the boundaries of the easement were worked out in conjunction with the university consultation with the engineering department of the city.

229
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:06,678
And the easement document itself has been approved by the city solicitor.

230
00:16:07,219 --> 00:16:16,346
So at this point, I'll turn it over to Ruthie Bennett who will detail for the council's benefit a little bit more information about the easement request.

231
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:18,108
Thank you Mr. President.

232
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,848
Mr. Clerk, if you could unmute Ruthie Bennett.

233
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:26,132
Good evening, Ms.

234
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:26,452
Bennett.

235
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:27,813
Name and address of the record, please.

236
00:16:28,434 --> 00:16:30,575
Sure, Ruthie Bennett, Tufts University.

237
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:34,498
Thank you very much for letting me present this evening.

238
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:41,722
So first of all, of course, I've been on Zoom for 15 months, and tonight my internet is unstable, so I'm going to try to get through the presentation.

239
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:46,266
Is there a way that I could share my screen to show you some of the drawings?

240
00:16:46,526 --> 00:16:47,166
Is that possible?

241
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:48,387
Mr. Clerk, can you yell?

242
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,031
One second, the clerk will take care of that for you.

243
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:52,091
Okay.

244
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:54,512
Just let me know when I should try to do that.

245
00:16:55,112 --> 00:17:00,674
Okay, Ruthie, you're all set.

246
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:01,614
Great.

247
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:02,254
Okay.

248
00:17:04,855 --> 00:17:08,336
So hopefully you're seeing my screen now, which is a drawing of the building.

249
00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:09,297
Yes.

250
00:17:10,724 --> 00:17:11,304
Okay, great.

251
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:14,765
So I just want to orient the council for a minute.

252
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:19,666
So basically, this is College Avenue on the bottom of the screen.

253
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:24,127
These are the MBTA tracks and Boston Avenue.

254
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:28,129
And this is the Cummings building on our site.

255
00:17:29,389 --> 00:17:31,389
This is the plaza in front of the building.

256
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,510
This is the main entrance to the building.

257
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:38,563
This is the sidewalk that we were talking about that slopes up College Avenue.

258
00:17:38,623 --> 00:17:42,024
This is the pedestrian bridge that the MBTA has just put in.

259
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:46,364
And this is the cafe that's open to the public.

260
00:17:47,745 --> 00:17:49,945
This is the easement, this strip of land.

261
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,205
It's about 1,100, 1,200 square feet.

262
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:54,406
You can see it's about 9 1⁄2 feet here, 7 1⁄2 feet here, and it's about 150 feet long.

263
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:05,054
And let me show you what the easement is in a rendering, because it's hard to understand what we're really talking about.

264
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:07,015
So basically this is the Cummings building.

265
00:18:07,976 --> 00:18:16,304
And as you know, the sidewalk here slopes, it's about a five to six foot slope from the bottom over here, all the way up to the pedestrian bridge.

266
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:22,470
And it was very important for us to have an accessible connection from the sidewalk to the main entrance of the building.

267
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:28,645
So the plaza, of course, is flat and the sidewalk is sloping up in this direction.

268
00:18:29,306 --> 00:18:35,674
But right here, there is an accessible connection from the sidewalk into the main entrance of the building.

269
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:43,583
In this blue area here, this is approximately, this is my rough drawing, but approximately the easement area.

270
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,655
So this is the courtyard, the plaza for the building.

271
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:52,618
These are the steps going up, the flat plaza, and then steps up again.

272
00:18:52,638 --> 00:19:05,886
And if we didn't have this easement, there would be a flat courtyard, flat plaza, and then there would be this drop, basically a drop from here down to six feet to get to the sidewalk.

273
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:13,170
And there would be a wall about six feet, and then going down to this accessible entrance, and then the wall would continue again.

274
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:30,309
So in working with the engineering department, what we proposed and they thought was a good idea was to have, instead of having a wall here, we would have this landscaping, basically, instead of a retaining wall, this is a sloped area.

275
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:37,294
So all of this green that you see is basically sloping from the courtyard down to the sidewalk.

276
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:41,317
And then here it starts to slope up to meet the sidewalk.

277
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:50,214
So what we're really asking for is an easement to have some basically grassy area and some xeriscaping, so drought-resistant plants.

278
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:53,096
This is the accessible connection.

279
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:58,120
So this part of the sidewalk that's in this part of the plaza that's accessible is on city land.

280
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,402
The same thing here, basically grass and some xeriscaping.

281
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:07,267
Oh, well, there's just kind of a slope that you walk next to.

282
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:09,248
It's a much nicer pedestrian experience.

283
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:23,173
This is a picture of before the project happened, this is basically the slope that happens at the site between the sidewalk and the site, as you know that sidewalk going up here is really steep, and then the site itself kind of dropped off.

284
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:27,390
We're really trying to make it a situation where it's nice for pedestrians.

285
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:35,095
There's my internet connections unstable, but where they're basically walking next to, like I said, kind of a landscaped area.

286
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:37,477
We're not going to build anything else on this area.

287
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:38,438
It's just landscape.

288
00:20:38,518 --> 00:20:42,220
We will maintain snow removal, trash removal.

289
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:47,444
This will always be an open, accessible connection from the sidewalk to the front of the building.

290
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,053
We can take any questions if you'd like.

291
00:20:52,273 --> 00:20:58,275
And again, if my internet goes out, then I think Rocco and Mr. Abruzzese can respond, but I'd be happy to take questions.

292
00:20:59,095 --> 00:20:59,415
Thank you.

293
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:02,716
I'll assume that that makes the plaza handicap accessible.

294
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:06,757
Yes, exactly right.

295
00:21:06,878 --> 00:21:12,259
This is a handicap accessible connection from the sidewalk to the building, the whole plaza and the cafe.

296
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:15,720
So yes, this is all accessible from the sidewalk right here.

297
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,280
Correct.

298
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:16,860
Thank you.

299
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:17,660
Question.

300
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:20,971
Thank you, Mr. President.

301
00:21:21,272 --> 00:21:24,234
Just remind me, that whole plaza is open to the public, correct?

302
00:21:26,956 --> 00:21:27,756
Correct, yes.

303
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:31,199
And this is a cafe to the public as well.

304
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:33,981
And actually, there's a separation between the cafe and the building.

305
00:21:34,161 --> 00:21:35,222
Sorry.

306
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:39,605
I think you said the cafe is open to the public as well, correct?

307
00:21:41,206 --> 00:21:41,466
Yes.

308
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:42,427
Sorry, I did.

309
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,007
I'm sorry.

310
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:46,370
Yes, cafe is open to the public.

311
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:46,790
Yes.

312
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:50,696
Move approval, Mr. President.

313
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:56,719
On the motion by Vice President Knight for approval, seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

314
00:21:57,939 --> 00:21:58,760
All those in favor?

315
00:21:59,620 --> 00:21:59,740
Aye.

316
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:00,801
All those opposed?

317
00:22:02,002 --> 00:22:02,802
Motion passes.

318
00:22:03,542 --> 00:22:03,923
Betsy.

319
00:22:06,424 --> 00:22:08,465
Mr. Bruese, Betsy, and Rocco, thank you very much.

320
00:22:08,485 --> 00:22:09,486
Thank you all.

321
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:10,906
Thank you very much.

322
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:11,867
Thank you.

323
00:22:21,102 --> 00:22:31,651
21437.

324
00:22:21,362 --> 00:22:31,651
21437.

325
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:31,651
21437.

326
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:31,651
Okay.

327
00:22:34,713 --> 00:22:38,636
Yep, I got it.

328
00:22:38,656 --> 00:22:48,464
21437, dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that the honorable body approve the following amendments to revise ordinance entitled Compensation Plans

329
00:22:48,903 --> 00:22:50,884
Leave Ordinance Chapter 68, Personnel.

330
00:22:53,766 --> 00:23:16,357
Amendment to the revised Ordinance Compensation Plan and Leave Ordinance Chapter 66, Personnel be it ordained by the Memphis City Council of the City of Memphis in Chapter 66 entitled Personnel Article 2 entitled Classification Compensation Plans Section 66-40 entitled Public Safety Personnel is hereby amended as follows.

331
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:17,318
Section 1.

332
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:38,422
In section 66.40, effective January 1, 2020, add 2% of the present amount of each step within the grades shown below to the said present amount of each step and adjust the sum thus obtained to the nearest and highest figure the following grades.

333
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:40,583
PS-2, Sergeant.

334
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:42,304
PS-3, Lieutenant.

335
00:23:42,624 --> 00:23:43,885
PS-4, Captain.

336
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:45,466
PS-5, Chief.

337
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:46,667
Section two.

338
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,371
in section 66.40, effective January 1, 2021.

339
00:23:51,611 --> 00:24:05,613
Add 2% of the present amount of each step within the grade shown below to the said present amount of each step and adjust the sum, thus obtain the nearest and highest figure for the following grades.

340
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:11,094
PS2, Sergeant, PS3, Lieutenant, PS4, Captain, PS5, Chief.

341
00:24:11,974 --> 00:24:15,215
Section three, in section 66.40, effective January 1,

342
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:28,649

343
00:24:28,949 --> 00:24:34,272
PS2 Sergeant, PS3 Lieutenant, PS4 Captain, PS5 Chief.

344
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:42,597
This amendment is requested due to a recently negotiated agreement with the Memphis Police Superior Officers Union that extended

345
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:45,430
the predecessor agreement to June 30, 2022.

346
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:55,755
It's estimated that the contract will cost approximately $307,656 in retroactive funds in fiscal year 2021.

347
00:24:56,455 --> 00:25:01,078
There is available funding to cover this in the police department and the personnel budget.

348
00:25:01,338 --> 00:25:02,479
Sincerely, Mayor.

349
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,340
Good evening, sir.

350
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,341
Mr. President, Lawrence Rogers, 100 Main Street.

351
00:25:08,401 --> 00:25:11,363
I'm the vice president of the Med Police Fair Results Association.

352
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:18,285
Mr. President, Met Police Ferry officers have been without a contract since June 30th, 2019.

353
00:25:20,146 --> 00:25:23,629
Prior to that date, we'd be in negotiations with the previous administration.

354
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:31,695
Once the new administration took over and due to COVID, there were numerous postponements.

355
00:25:33,136 --> 00:25:37,899
On May 5th, we came to an agreement with the city on a new collective bargaining agreement.

356
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,442
On May 10th, the union unanimously ratified the contract.

357
00:25:42,152 --> 00:25:47,855
Since then, we have heard nothing to be presented for the council.

358
00:25:49,115 --> 00:26:04,402
Mr. President, we respectfully request that the body approve the resolution and also waive these three readings due to the fact that the summer recess is coming up and due to the fact that it's going on two years without a contract.

359
00:26:04,782 --> 00:26:05,302
Thank you.

360
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:06,683
Questions?

361
00:26:08,364 --> 00:26:08,844
Councilor Maxwell.

362
00:26:10,082 --> 00:26:11,083
Thank you, Mr. President.

363
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:20,307
And I want to thank all our superior officers in this community that haven't missed a beat over the last 18 months during the pandemic.

364
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:24,649
This is, in my opinion, a very modest raise.

365
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:30,632
It's comparable to other raises with other unions throughout the community.

366
00:26:31,452 --> 00:26:36,594
And where this has been outstanding since, as we stated, 2019, Mr. President,

367
00:26:38,623 --> 00:26:43,265
I've been on record for many occasions not waiving the three readings.

368
00:26:43,905 --> 00:26:52,529
And the reason why, Mr. President, is that the three readings require open transparency within our community.

369
00:26:53,109 --> 00:26:55,310
And I've always been opposed to waiving the readings.

370
00:26:55,830 --> 00:27:06,215
However, in certain circumstances, Mr. President, when, in my opinion, when raises the three years and arrears, that those are the certain circumstances.

371
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:20,487
Tonight, Mr. President, I will be supporting not only this paper, but I will offer the formal motion that the three, what do you call it?

372
00:27:20,667 --> 00:27:20,988
Readings.

373
00:27:21,228 --> 00:27:22,169
Readings, thank you.

374
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:28,654
The three readings be waived, Mr. President, based on the fact that this has been outstanding for over two years.

375
00:27:29,075 --> 00:27:29,996
Thank you, Mr. President.

376
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:30,736
Thank you.

377
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:31,337
Thank you.

378
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:32,678
Any further discussion?

379
00:27:33,238 --> 00:27:33,839
Vice President Knight.

380
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:35,605
Mr. President, thank you very much.

381
00:27:35,665 --> 00:27:40,226
And through you to Mr. Rogers and the rest of the security officer staff, thank you for the work you do.

382
00:27:40,607 --> 00:27:43,088
I have no problem supporting this matter before us this evening.

383
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:49,970
I do feel as though a strong contract negotiated in good faith between the administration and the union does make this community stronger.

384
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:51,551
And I thank you for your service.

385
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:52,832
Thank you.

386
00:27:53,192 --> 00:27:54,312
Any further questions?

387
00:27:54,712 --> 00:27:59,054
Mr. President, I would move for approval and I would also second Councilor Maxwell's amendment.

388
00:27:59,074 --> 00:28:00,955
Okay, on the motion by Vice President Knight,

389
00:28:04,662 --> 00:28:05,322
but that's the amendment.

390
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:17,647
On the motion by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Marks to waive the three readings, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

391
00:28:17,807 --> 00:28:23,589
And if we could just record the waiving of the three readings, Mr. President, because of the contract being in arrears for almost three years.

392
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:24,769
Thank you.

393
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:25,950
Any further discussions?

394
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:29,531
Okay, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

395
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:31,812
Councilor Scott Pelli.

396
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:36,190
but this is a money paper that requires a roll call vote.

397
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:42,054
Councilor Peers.

398
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:42,494
Yes.

399
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,155
Councilor Fevella.

400
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:44,755
Yes.

401
00:28:45,596 --> 00:28:46,256
Vice President Knight.

402
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:46,636
Yes.

403
00:28:47,177 --> 00:28:47,717
Councilor Marks.

404
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:48,638
Yes.

405
00:28:49,178 --> 00:28:49,778
Councilor Morrell.

406
00:28:50,018 --> 00:28:50,239
Yes.

407
00:28:50,739 --> 00:28:51,459
Councilor Scarpelli.

408
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,380
Yes.

409
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,501
President Kerrio.

410
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:54,021
Yes.

411
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:57,323
Seven in favor of zero opposition motion passes.

412
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:00,785
Motion to refer back to regular business.

413
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:04,412
Oh, did you have one more?

414
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,393
No, that was the one.

415
00:29:06,473 --> 00:29:07,193
Okay, thank you.

416
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:09,854
It was a different number, but the number was changed.

417
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:10,414
The number was changed.

418
00:29:10,474 --> 00:29:10,554
Okay.

419
00:29:13,615 --> 00:29:24,337
Motions, orders, and resolutions offered by Vice President Knight, be it so resolved that Mr. DeCato send a deep and sincere condolences to the family of Rick Sweeney on his recent passing.

420
00:29:24,437 --> 00:29:25,137
Vice President Knight.

421
00:29:25,437 --> 00:29:30,599
Yes, Mr. President, Rick Sweeney was a gentleman who worked a long career in the Metropolitan County.

422
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:31,539
He had recently retired.

423
00:29:32,758 --> 00:29:39,962
as evident in many that work in public safety, especially by a service, very shortly after retirement, he had succumbed to health issues.

424
00:29:40,022 --> 00:29:48,207
Rick was a great person, and Rick was one of those people that, you know, a lot of people would say, if you had a problem with Rick, it was probably something that was wrong with you, because Rick was a great guy.

425
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:51,869
I got the pleasure of meeting Rick when he became a member of the Elks.

426
00:29:51,929 --> 00:30:00,755
He was a great participant in a number of charitable organizations and charitable efforts that the Elks have put forward, and he's someone who will be sorely missed, Mr. President, so I offer this resolution.

427
00:30:02,074 --> 00:30:11,817
and recognition of the work that he did in this community, and recognition of the fact that for over 30 years, he put his life on the line as a firefighter here for the residents of the community, and he's someone that should be remembered.

428
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:16,879
So with that being said, I ask my council colleagues to support this.

429
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:17,759
Thank you, Mr. President.

430
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:20,320
I want to thank Vice President Knight for putting this on.

431
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,501
Ricky Sweeney, if you knew him, you loved him.

432
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:27,222
That was the type of person he was, Mr. President.

433
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,383
32 years as a firefighter, past Vice President of Local 1032,

434
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:37,671
As Councilor Knight mentioned, an outstanding member of the Method, an active member of the Method Elks.

435
00:30:38,452 --> 00:30:48,219
And I want to send my condolences to his wife, Kelly, his children, Aaron, Jen, and his firefighter son, Joseph, who serves currently as Mr. President.

436
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:55,084
And anyone that knows Ricky knew he loved to spend time in Maine and loved to be around his family.

437
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:59,988
And the one thing that I hear over and over from people was,

438
00:31:00,506 --> 00:31:03,208
that I guess Ricky was a master carpenter.

439
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:10,573
And if he ever needed any help, he was the first to come with his skills, Mr. President, and assist.

440
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:15,216
And never looking for anything other than the fact that he liked to help people.

441
00:31:15,696 --> 00:31:22,300
So I'd like to, if Councilor Knight seems fit to, I'll have you do it.

442
00:31:24,181 --> 00:31:28,084
Honor him by naming this meeting, Mr. President, in his honor.

443
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:30,854
And I want to thank council vice president for putting this on.

444
00:31:31,675 --> 00:31:32,035
Thank you.

445
00:31:32,695 --> 00:31:34,397
And how's this?

446
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:36,539
I just want to thank you.

447
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,762
Um, counsel counselor night counselor marks, uh, send my condolences to the family.

448
00:31:41,263 --> 00:31:45,406
Uh, Mr. Sweeney was an uncle of one of my close friends and I know that they are still in mourning.

449
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:46,687
So sending my best to them.

450
00:31:46,928 --> 00:31:47,268
Thank you.

451
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:48,969
Thank you.

452
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:52,452
And, uh, I knew Rick, uh, he lived around the corner for many years for me.

453
00:31:52,532 --> 00:31:56,496
And, uh, he was at my house with a star from schools and I needed some help.

454
00:31:56,536 --> 00:31:56,856
So, uh,

455
00:31:57,263 --> 00:32:01,124
Again, look at also the family, he was a good guy and he's gonna be messed up.

456
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:10,027
On the motion by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Marks and seconded by, seconded by Councilor Falco.

457
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:13,448
All those in favor, please stand for a moment of silence.

458
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:41,050
2-1-4-2-4 offered by Vice President Saint, being so resolved, the University of Colorado extended deep and sincere condolences to the family of Paul Kavanaugh on his recent passing.

459
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,210
Vice President May.

460
00:32:42,531 --> 00:33:01,063
Mr. Kavanaugh, Mr. President, was a gentleman who was also a member of the Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk

461
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:05,766
picked up the torch where he left off in her efforts in volunteering in the community.

462
00:33:06,507 --> 00:33:07,948
We all know Carrie from Channel 25.

463
00:33:08,328 --> 00:33:13,172
She hosted last year's mayoral debate as a matter of fact, two years ago, the mayoral debate as a matter of fact.

464
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:16,114
But Paul was just a great person.

465
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:22,139
His wife was a school teacher and they met through public schools for a number of years, and they're really some people that have given a lot to this community.

466
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:26,723
And Paul had a very public battle with cancer and he succumbed to the effects

467
00:33:27,116 --> 00:33:29,298
thereof, and he'll be sorely missed, Mr President.

468
00:33:29,318 --> 00:33:32,360
So with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution.

469
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,240
Any further discussion?

470
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:37,603
So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

471
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:40,505
All those in favor?

472
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:42,807
Motion passes.

473
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:44,068
Please rise for a moment of silence.

474
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:15,800
2-1, 4-2-6, offered by Council Marks, being resolved that Teresa Castanetti, lead teacher coach in the English Learners Department for the Meffitt Public School be recognized for a 45 year commitment and leadership to the students of Meffitt on a recent retirement.

475
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:17,121
Council Marks.

476
00:34:17,561 --> 00:34:18,642
Thank you, Mr. President.

477
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:27,888
It's my honor to stand before this council and the residents of this community to honor one of Meffitt's finest, Mr. President, Teresa Castanetti,

478
00:34:28,797 --> 00:34:32,098
I think we all, behind this reel, know Teresa.

479
00:34:32,818 --> 00:34:42,941
Teresa was an advocate for our students, serving as the lead teacher and coach for the English Learners Department for many decades, Mr. President.

480
00:34:43,621 --> 00:34:46,822
Teresa had a career that was remarkable.

481
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:48,963
She always stood up for what she believed.

482
00:34:49,623 --> 00:34:57,725
Even recently, as of last year, Mr. President, when the condition of the sidewalks and the curbing and the road into the McGlynn

483
00:34:58,375 --> 00:35:15,847
and Andrews Middle School was in poor condition and caused trip and hazards for parents, children, and faculty, Teresa was the first one to step forward and kept on stepping forward, bringing this council up to date on the needs.

484
00:35:16,768 --> 00:35:25,954
And it was Teresa Castaneda that I largely credit for making those things happen within that area, Mr. President.

485
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:33,672
Teresa worked in the Kids' Corner daycare as executive board chairperson and secretary from 1992 to 95.

486
00:35:35,293 --> 00:35:44,479
So in addition to her duties as a lead teacher, she also found the time to work in the Kids' Corner daycare as an executive member, Mr. President.

487
00:35:45,419 --> 00:35:54,245
Back in 2015, annual state award given to a teacher who exemplifies excellence in the education of English language learners.

488
00:35:54,833 --> 00:36:17,779
through evidence of best instructional practices, long-term commitment to the education of ELLS, leadership roles at the school's district, level of behalf of the ELLs, mentoring of new ELL teachers through formal induction programs, and strong relationships to parents of ELLs in the community.

489
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:23,040
So back in 2015, Teresa received the Distinguished Award

490
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:25,494
Teacher of the Year, Mr. President.

491
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:35,940
It's a statewide award, and believe me, they were able to recognize the merits of Teresa Castaneda and her accomplishments.

492
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:41,524
Teresa served as the ELE teacher for the Memphis Public Schools from 2016 to 2021.

493
00:36:41,564 --> 00:36:46,747
Teresa was a mentor teacher for the Memphis Public Schools from 2001 to 2021, over 20 years, Mr. President.

494
00:36:52,890 --> 00:37:04,735
She was a supervising practitioner for several general education teachers and Lesley University graduate students to complete their 150-hour internship towards ESL licensure.

495
00:37:05,535 --> 00:37:22,322
And from 2008 to 2014, Teresa was selected by DESE to participate on several DESE panels and committees for assessment and development standard settings for the Statewide Language Proficiency Exam and train the trainer cohorts

496
00:37:22,846 --> 00:37:31,969
and second language learning and teaching, in which Teresa, in turn, provided professional development for the district, right here, Mr. President.

497
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:37,031
Teresa also served as co-chairperson for the McGlynn Elementary School literacy team.

498
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:49,316
And in 2008, 2009, Teresa co-chaired the creation of the district's first school-based literacy team, which established uniform K through five literacy assessment protocols.

499
00:37:50,096 --> 00:37:57,821
and a building-wide K-5 literacy action plan for the McGlynn Elementary School, which was adopted as a model for the district, Mr. President.

500
00:37:59,122 --> 00:38:16,074
I can only say, Mr. President, that knowing Theresa over the years, knowing her professionalism, the way she dealt with her colleagues, the way she dealt with parents, faculty, students, I think goes unmatched in our community, Mr. President.

501
00:38:16,574 --> 00:38:17,935
And it's only appropriate that

502
00:38:18,365 --> 00:38:21,706
I rise here today thanking her for her 45 years of commitment.

503
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:26,008
I would ask that Teresa receive a council accommodation for her years.

504
00:38:26,788 --> 00:38:40,494
And I also want to thank her, Mr. President, for putting up with Andrew Castanetti, her lovely husband for many years, Mr. President, who we all know and love as well.

505
00:38:41,194 --> 00:38:44,195
And I just want to thank Teresa and wish her well on her retirement.

506
00:38:44,596 --> 00:38:46,997
And I'm sure we're going to see her around the community, Mr. President.

507
00:38:47,017 --> 00:38:47,317
Thank you.

508
00:38:50,541 --> 00:38:51,342
Thank you, Mr. President.

509
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:57,707
I want to thank Councilor Mox for bringing this resolution forward and thank Teresa for her 45 years.

510
00:38:59,148 --> 00:39:00,049
That's quite a commitment.

511
00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:05,274
So I want to thank her for her commitment to the community and her commitment to the Medford Public Schools.

512
00:39:05,294 --> 00:39:13,921
When you think about it, 45 years, she has touched the lives of thousands of students and hundreds of teachers that I'm sure she's mentored along the way.

513
00:39:13,941 --> 00:39:16,183
And I want to thank her for her commitment

514
00:39:16,705 --> 00:39:21,888
in her time and her energy to the community and to Memphis public school system and wish her well in her retirement.

515
00:39:22,188 --> 00:39:22,548
Thank you.

516
00:39:22,648 --> 00:39:22,949
Thank you.

517
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,209
Oh, Scott.

518
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:24,950
Thank you, Mr. President.

519
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,271
Thank you, Councilor Maxwell and members of the board.

520
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:32,774
I had the privilege and honor of working with Teresa at the Osgoode School and then the McGlynn School.

521
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:40,239
And one thing you realize as a young teacher, you look for role models to follow.

522
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:42,980
And Teresa was that role model.

523
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,262
I think that we focused as young teachers

524
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:49,389
to make sure you look at the intangibles.

525
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:53,830
And what we learned from Teresa is her passion for the children, every single one.

526
00:39:53,950 --> 00:40:11,634
So she was a true advocate for all of her kids and for our teachers that were at times going through contract negotiations and the nerves that are felt with non-tenured professionals.

527
00:40:12,274 --> 00:40:15,055
And she was a rock that

528
00:40:15,812 --> 00:40:17,353
kept a lot of young teachers together.

529
00:40:18,534 --> 00:40:20,435
And she was a great role model.

530
00:40:20,855 --> 00:40:25,357
So as a friend and a former colleague, I want to congratulate her.

531
00:40:25,377 --> 00:40:27,999
I actually thought she would never retire.

532
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:34,122
And but it's, it's it's it's sad because I think she still has another 45 years in it.

533
00:40:34,162 --> 00:40:37,384
So I appreciate it and wish her luck.

534
00:40:37,444 --> 00:40:39,165
So thank you.

535
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:41,626
Mr. President, thank you very much.

536
00:40:42,127 --> 00:40:44,248
One thing that's always amazed me about Teresa was

537
00:40:45,593 --> 00:41:00,339
The passion that she had for the job, she never lost that passion and love for the job, even after, you know, four and a half decades of teaching, she was still coming up there advocating for the students when the easy thing to do after four and a half decades of teaching would be to say, oh, the next generation is going to take care of it.

538
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:07,543
She's someone that certainly led by example, put her money where her mouth is, and was always out here working on behalf of the children in the community.

539
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:08,243
So it's something

540
00:41:08,853 --> 00:41:16,538
that I think is very grateful, that I'm very grateful for Mr. President, the effort and energy that she put forth, how she went above and beyond to do some of the things that she did.

541
00:41:17,379 --> 00:41:27,065
And I want her to enjoy her retirement as best as she possibly can in the lovely neighborhood of East Method.

542
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:32,949
We can keep going, but it's not televised.

543
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,330
Are we still televised?

544
00:41:36,912 --> 00:41:37,572
Give it a minute.

545
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:41,930
If we could hold on one second, a little power search here.

546
00:41:42,491 --> 00:41:46,994
Curiously, the main plug the whole city.

547
00:41:51,498 --> 00:41:52,939
Quick call text back.

548
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,941
All right.

549
00:41:54,961 --> 00:41:55,621
We seem to be back.

550
00:41:55,701 --> 00:41:56,822
Thank you, Mr. President.

551
00:41:56,842 --> 00:41:57,363
Thank you very much.

552
00:41:57,383 --> 00:42:04,889
So with that being said, in closing, I just would like to make sure that Teresa enjoys her retirement or golden years and other 45 years in the

553
00:42:05,577 --> 00:42:14,920
beautiful neighborhood of East Medford with her lovely husband, Mr. Piatel, that they enjoy their time together during her golden years.

554
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:15,881
Thank you.

555
00:42:16,781 --> 00:42:17,761
And preach that again.

556
00:42:17,941 --> 00:42:24,223
Thank you for your years of service, both to the city and to your husband.

557
00:42:25,064 --> 00:42:29,585
So again, congratulations on your retirement and good luck.

558
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:32,006
All right.

559
00:42:32,266 --> 00:42:33,867
On the motion by

560
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:38,431
by Councilor Marks, seconded by Vice President Knight.

561
00:42:38,631 --> 00:42:39,332
All those in favor?

562
00:42:39,992 --> 00:42:40,132
Aye.

563
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:40,732
All opposed?

564
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:47,076
Motion passes.

565
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:47,116
2-1.

566
00:42:47,136 --> 00:43:01,863
4-2-7, offered by Councilor Marks and President Caravaglio, be resolved that Sheryl Mayalka will be recognized in her recent retirement from the Medford Public Schools Special Education Department for her outstanding commitment and dedication to the students and families of Medford for the past 40 years.

567
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:02,623
Councilor Marks?

568
00:43:03,703 --> 00:43:04,683
Thank you, Mr. President.

569
00:43:04,703 --> 00:43:06,524
I want to thank you for co-sponsoring this.

570
00:43:07,364 --> 00:43:13,445
Here we are once again, Mr. President, another faculty member within our public schools.

571
00:43:14,465 --> 00:43:26,467
42 years of dedication to the students, the parents, and to our Memphis public school system, I think is something that really deserves recognition, Mr. President.

572
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:31,088
Cheryl Mayarco is a well-respected employee of the Memphis public schools.

573
00:43:31,873 --> 00:43:38,275
in the special ed department, who dedicated over 42 years of service to our most vulnerable students.

574
00:43:39,235 --> 00:43:45,456
Cheryl started a career in method as a substitute teacher and instructional aid in 1978.

575
00:43:46,857 --> 00:43:49,937
Cheryl became a special education teacher in 1980.

576
00:43:51,358 --> 00:44:00,960
For the past 20 years, Cheryl has worked tirelessly as an evaluation team leader, providing mentoring and guidance to newer ETLs

577
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:02,698
and staff members.

578
00:44:03,758 --> 00:44:14,840
Cheryl was passionate about the Children of Method, acting as a strong advocate for student needs and making personal connections with every student she assisted.

579
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:23,522
Cheryl was dedicated to caring for the whole child, communicating with parents, caregivers, and educational team members.

580
00:44:24,722 --> 00:44:31,403
Cheryl was always expanding her knowledge and her expertise to be prepared and responsive to families and students

581
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:32,450
of method.

582
00:44:33,992 --> 00:44:44,379
Colleagues and families remarked that Cheryl went over and above in assisting families and students with patience, positive attitude, and a caring nature.

583
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:51,665
And for all of us that know Cheryl, Mr. President, know these words are completely true.

584
00:44:52,285 --> 00:44:54,707
Cheryl gave everything she could to her job.

585
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:56,508
She liked what she did.

586
00:44:57,629 --> 00:44:59,030
She excelled what she did.

587
00:44:59,886 --> 00:45:06,111
And she really made, I think, a lot of strides in the special ed department.

588
00:45:06,852 --> 00:45:14,118
She was someone that you can count on to make sure that if services were needed for a child, Cheryl would fight for the student.

589
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,300
You didn't need to hire an outside advocate.

590
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:26,288
It was Cheryl Mayorko that would step up and make sure that each and every child received the proper services, Mr. President, for their education.

591
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:28,470
And parents respected that.

592
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:30,145
um, in our system.

593
00:45:30,845 --> 00:45:57,144
Uh, you know, the my uncle couple, which I refer to as Cheryl, my uncle and Robert, my uncle, who served on this body for over three decades, um, and the capacity of council president is and as a member of this body, uh, they were a power couple in this community, Mr President, for many decades, and both were well respected and leaders in this community, and they continue to be leaders in this community.

594
00:45:57,224 --> 00:45:57,364
So

595
00:45:58,242 --> 00:46:17,408
I would personally like to ask Mr. President that Cheryl Mayarco receive a council accommodation for her 42 years of dedicated service to our students, our most vulnerable students, parents, faculty, and the entire community, Mr. President.

596
00:46:17,428 --> 00:46:18,248
I would like to thank her.

597
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:18,748
Thank you.

598
00:46:18,948 --> 00:46:20,729
Chair recognizes Councilor Caravaglio.

599
00:46:21,309 --> 00:46:22,209
Thank you, Mr. President.

600
00:46:22,389 --> 00:46:24,570
It's always so typical following Councilor Marks.

601
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:26,551
with his dissertations.

602
00:46:27,732 --> 00:46:31,355
He kind of takes all the praise out of everything there.

603
00:46:31,495 --> 00:46:33,957
I've known Cheryl many years personally.

604
00:46:33,977 --> 00:46:36,620
He's a teacher and as a friend.

605
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,042
And Bob and I have been friends for many years also.

606
00:46:40,523 --> 00:46:45,227
I just want to thank Cheryl for her work to special needs students of Medford.

607
00:46:46,068 --> 00:46:51,072
And those are really the kids that really need that extra help that other students don't get.

608
00:46:51,312 --> 00:46:52,373
So again, I just want to thank her.

609
00:46:53,197 --> 00:46:56,039
for all her work and commitment to the city of Memphis.

610
00:46:56,059 --> 00:46:56,640
Thank you, Cheryl.

611
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,761
Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

612
00:46:59,461 --> 00:47:00,222
Thank you, Mr. President.

613
00:47:00,742 --> 00:47:03,064
Again, thank you, Councilor Marks for this forward.

614
00:47:03,104 --> 00:47:13,491
I know another colleague that I work with, and you know the passion that Cheryl, my uncle had for her kids in this community.

615
00:47:14,952 --> 00:47:22,597
It spoke volumes, at least to me that, you know, especially when I first started on the school committee, you know, she wasn't afraid to call us

616
00:47:23,242 --> 00:47:25,784
and tell us exactly what her kids needed.

617
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:28,386
And, uh, and she was a strong advocate for that.

618
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:35,352
So, um, I wish her well on her retirement and congratulate her for all the commitment she had for our community and our children.

619
00:47:35,832 --> 00:47:36,333
So thank you.

620
00:47:39,095 --> 00:47:39,996
Thank you, Mr. President.

621
00:47:40,036 --> 00:47:44,539
I also want to thank Councilor Marks and Councilor Carviello for bringing this resolution forward.

622
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,521
I also want to thank Cheryl for her

623
00:47:47,506 --> 00:47:50,769
42 years of service, like I said earlier, very similar.

624
00:47:50,809 --> 00:47:52,391
That is quite a commitment.

625
00:47:52,471 --> 00:47:54,092
And you don't see that too often these days.

626
00:47:54,813 --> 00:47:58,836
That's the thousands of students that she has impacted throughout the years.

627
00:47:59,477 --> 00:48:03,520
And the dedication is amazing.

628
00:48:03,921 --> 00:48:12,408
And I know, like Councilor Scott probably stated earlier, if there was ever an issue, Cheryl would be the first one to call you and tell us what was going on and what help was needed.

629
00:48:12,428 --> 00:48:14,230
And she was always there advocating for the students.

630
00:48:14,864 --> 00:48:21,991
And I want to thank her for many, many years of service to the youth of our community, to the Memphis Public Schools, and wish her well in her time.

631
00:48:22,171 --> 00:48:22,491
Thank you.

632
00:48:23,833 --> 00:48:24,593
Thank you, Councilor Palacio.

633
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:29,558
And if I may, from the chair, Mr. President, I'd just like to also extend a great congratulations to Cheryl.

634
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:37,585
I echo the sentiments of my council colleagues, and I do look forward to seeing her this summer by the pool at her nephew's house, and her niece's house.

635
00:48:37,766 --> 00:48:40,308
With that being said, the chair recognizes the gentleman at the podium, Mr. Gallo.

636
00:48:41,606 --> 00:48:43,227
Giglio, Winthrop Street.

637
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:47,809
I also would like to thank Cheryl when I saw this on the agenda tonight, I wanted to come down.

638
00:48:49,249 --> 00:49:03,955
We've known Cheryl since my boys were in grade school, but now more importantly, since we took on the task of taking custody of a three-year-old who's very behind special needs since day one, since the M.E.E.T.

639
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:08,497
program, preschool, kindergarten, now going into first grade, Cheryl has taken the ball with her

640
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:13,508
Not only has she given her the assistance that we thought she needed, but she's given her extra.

641
00:49:13,808 --> 00:49:14,788
She's, she's really good.

642
00:49:14,808 --> 00:49:17,229
I know Mr. Falco says there's thousands of kids.

643
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:18,449
I can speak for one.

644
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:23,470
Um, and I, I couldn't say thank you any more to, uh, miss Mayako.

645
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:34,132
Um, and again, if, if there's ever a question that she emailed us with and we didn't get back to her, she would call us on the phone just to make sure she got that answer, whatever information she needed.

646
00:49:34,152 --> 00:49:37,073
So personally, I'd like to thank miss Mayako as well.

647
00:49:37,533 --> 00:49:37,753
Thank you.

648
00:49:38,765 --> 00:49:39,005
Thank you.

649
00:49:39,045 --> 00:49:39,545
Thank you very much.

650
00:49:39,585 --> 00:49:49,548
Great testament on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

651
00:49:49,788 --> 00:49:50,809
All those in favor?

652
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:51,169
Aye.

653
00:49:51,809 --> 00:49:54,870
As amended, Mr. President.

654
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,250
All those in favor?

655
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:57,110
All those opposed?

656
00:49:58,291 --> 00:49:58,951
The ayes have it.

657
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,271
The motion passed.

658
00:50:02,612 --> 00:50:05,753
Council paper 21428 offered by Councilor Marks.

659
00:50:06,346 --> 00:50:15,769
Be it resolved, the city council asks the city solicitor for a ruling on whether the council, through city ordinance, can craft the process for the naming of any municipal or school building or facility.

660
00:50:16,129 --> 00:50:17,569
The chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

661
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:19,230
Thank you, Mr. President.

662
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:24,212
This was an item that was put on the agenda last week under public participation.

663
00:50:24,912 --> 00:50:35,315
And we had a number of residents that came up to speak on their concerns regarding the now, I guess, resolved issue of the naming of the Columbus School.

664
00:50:35,796 --> 00:50:38,417
That was somewhat of a lengthy process that took place.

665
00:50:39,618 --> 00:50:43,460
I believe there was much division in the community over this process.

666
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,222
Many people felt that they weren't heard.

667
00:50:47,282 --> 00:50:49,403
Many people felt that they weren't part of the process.

668
00:50:50,283 --> 00:51:02,389
And what I'm offering here tonight, Mr. President, is that we take a closer look at the naming of any building in the community, whether it's on the school side or the city side.

669
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:04,570
As a member of the school committee,

670
00:51:05,337 --> 00:51:06,958
I can attest to you firsthand.

671
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:16,381
I actually am one of the members that actually voted against the naming of one of our schools back some 20 years ago.

672
00:51:17,261 --> 00:51:20,082
And it wasn't because I was opposed to the name, Mr. President.

673
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:22,663
It was more of a process issue I had.

674
00:51:23,383 --> 00:51:25,924
And at the time, I felt there wasn't enough public input.

675
00:51:26,685 --> 00:51:30,726
There wasn't enough community participation in regards to the selection of the name.

676
00:51:31,326 --> 00:51:33,227
And therefore, I actually voted against

677
00:51:33,951 --> 00:51:38,815
the naming of one of our, what we refer to as new schools now that are 20 years old.

678
00:51:39,736 --> 00:51:59,072
I would say, Mr. President, that in a community of this size, when you're talking about naming a school building, and know that many of these buildings, whether it's a municipal building, or a park, or the corner of an intersection that's named, this has personal memories to people.

679
00:51:59,573 --> 00:52:02,215
It has personal feelings.

680
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:09,132
And I think we have to be very mindful of that when we have a process to look at the renaming.

681
00:52:09,832 --> 00:52:11,452
I'm not opposed to renaming.

682
00:52:11,533 --> 00:52:20,975
I'm not opposed to looking at things in retrospect, but what I am opposed to Mr. President is a process where people feel left out.

683
00:52:21,755 --> 00:52:25,657
And if one person feels left out, that's enough for me, Mr. President.

684
00:52:26,377 --> 00:52:30,558
And I'm respectfully asking that we ask our city solicitor

685
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:41,319
I don't doubt for a second that the school committee has the authority to name a building, and I've told people that over the past year and a half, that they have the ability to name a building.

686
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:59,150
All I'm asking is whether or not the Memphis City Council, through way of an ordinance, can create a policy, Mr. President, that includes the entire community when it comes to looking at municipal or school-owned buildings, and that we create

687
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:18,594
a policy and procedure that ultimately has the goal of incorporating every comment, every person's wishes, and coming out with a process that we can all feel proud of at the end and not have the division that we're seeing right now, Mr. President.

688
00:53:18,614 --> 00:53:20,455
And that's all this is trying to accomplish.

689
00:53:20,856 --> 00:53:24,979
This is not trying to take away anyone's responsibilities, anyone's duties.

690
00:53:25,719 --> 00:53:26,980
It's seeing a concern.

691
00:53:27,821 --> 00:53:29,182
When I see a community divided,

692
00:53:29,794 --> 00:53:30,475
That concerns me.

693
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,535
I've been around a lot of years.

694
00:53:32,336 --> 00:53:41,844
And when I see a community divided over an issue, we as legislators, the executive branch, I think have to step up and say, how do we better this process?

695
00:53:42,184 --> 00:53:48,670
How do we make it so we don't have to go through this every time we may decide that we want to rename something?

696
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:56,316
And I feel that if this process continues in the manner it's going, all it's going to do is create division.

697
00:53:56,756 --> 00:53:58,658
And that would include on the municipal side.

698
00:53:59,446 --> 00:54:01,767
So I'm not saying this is strictly a school issue.

699
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:03,488
It's on the municipal side as well.

700
00:54:03,508 --> 00:54:06,369
So I'm saying, open up the process to the entire community.

701
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:08,870
And those are my comments, Mr. President.

702
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:09,230
Thank you.

703
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:12,692
Thank you, Mr. President.

704
00:54:13,072 --> 00:54:14,913
Thank you, Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

705
00:54:15,993 --> 00:54:26,638
I certainly don't disagree that a standard process and procedure that would allow for, you know, the renaming of any municipal facility or building or

706
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:33,933
I think we might even want to outline everything we mean here because he meant in corners and streets and that kind of thing would be good.

707
00:54:34,613 --> 00:54:39,935
My only concern goes back to what you were saying about who has the authority around school facilities.

708
00:54:40,515 --> 00:54:43,697
I think I could support this if we didn't include the school facilities.

709
00:54:43,757 --> 00:54:49,779
And I think whatever we come up with for the city side could easily be taken up as a model by the school committee to use for school facilities.

710
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:53,881
I just have concerns around the legal authority as outlined and I wouldn't want

711
00:54:55,485 --> 00:55:02,047
I wouldn't want the city solicitor to come back and say, well, you don't have the authority around school buildings, X, Y, Z. So that's my main concern here.

712
00:55:02,107 --> 00:55:10,769
Other than that, I agree that having a strong process with clear outcomes, certainly, hopefully we'll bring at least more people together.

713
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:14,810
I don't know if we're ever going to get everyone to agree to every renaming, but I think it's important that we try.

714
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:15,450
Thank you.

715
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:18,791
So, Mr. President, I appreciate those comments.

716
00:55:19,031 --> 00:55:23,132
And I would only state that what I'm trying to do through this resolution

717
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:35,645
is ask our chief legal officer, who is attorney Kim Scanlon, whether or not we first of all have the jurisdiction and authority to create an ordinance that would cover a separate body.

718
00:55:36,045 --> 00:55:37,405
The school committee is a separate body.

719
00:55:37,425 --> 00:55:38,486
They're an autonomous body.

720
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:40,947
And I understand the boundaries.

721
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:44,489
However, we are the legislative body for the entire community.

722
00:55:45,069 --> 00:55:49,271
And the school committee falls under the purview of this city.

723
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:51,172
And if the

724
00:55:52,171 --> 00:55:59,594
solicitor came back and said, I don't believe that you can do that as a council through way of ordinance, to me, then the issue would be dropped by myself.

725
00:56:00,194 --> 00:56:02,055
I'm not gonna pursue anything.

726
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:15,339
But if the city solicitor came back and said, indeed, you have the ability to do that, I think that would call for a subcommittee or committee of the whole, maybe even a joint meeting with the school committee and the administration to discuss next steps.

727
00:56:15,399 --> 00:56:20,041
But all I'm doing is asking what our options are right now.

728
00:56:20,454 --> 00:56:23,455
and not forcing anything on anyone at this particular point.

729
00:56:23,955 --> 00:56:26,116
So that's all I wanna get across, Mr. President.

730
00:56:29,937 --> 00:56:32,678
Perhaps can we ask two questions instead of one then?

731
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:41,460
Could the city ask the city solicitor for a ruling on whether the council through ordinance can craft a process for the naming of a school building?

732
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:46,942
And then maybe the second one could be a further resolve that the city council ask the city solicitor for

733
00:56:48,554 --> 00:56:53,837
an example of a process for the naming of any municipal building or facility, something like that.

734
00:56:53,897 --> 00:56:58,661
I just wanna make sure we ask both questions so we get an answer on each of them.

735
00:57:01,923 --> 00:57:10,148
The way that I'm reading this is no more than the councilor asking a question as to whether or not the Medford city council is a legal authority to establish and define a process to be used.

736
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:14,871
It's not in from what I can read a motion or an attempt to preclude

737
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:36,256
any elected body from exercising their rights, what it's doing is establishing, requesting more or less an opinion as to whether or not a universal and standardized process can be crafted so that that can be utilized across all realms of government when it comes to the renaming of any type of facility of the like.

738
00:57:36,276 --> 00:57:38,238
I don't really think we need to split hairs over this.

739
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:40,379
It's not like we're trying to step on anybody's toes.

740
00:57:40,399 --> 00:57:41,500
All we're doing is asking the question,

741
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:43,080
can we establish a process?

742
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:46,462
And if we do establish that process, is it good for the school department as well as the city?

743
00:57:47,903 --> 00:57:49,024
I don't see what's scary about that.

744
00:57:49,104 --> 00:57:52,506
If in fact, it comes back with the answer that's a yes, then that's a whole different story.

745
00:57:53,287 --> 00:57:58,570
But until we get there, I think that there's no harm in asking the question as presented.

746
00:58:00,231 --> 00:58:05,235
If I may, but that's exactly, you kind of outlined exactly my point, which is that it's, can we do this?

747
00:58:05,395 --> 00:58:07,596
And can we do this specifically for schools?

748
00:58:09,095 --> 00:58:17,198
If we ask this question, I think we've gone through this before where we've asked a question and the language hasn't been quite right, and we've gotten kind of a wavery answer.

749
00:58:17,398 --> 00:58:27,941
I'm just concerned that if we ask the question this way, the answer might be no, because the school committee has authority over schools instead of, you know, no, you can't do it for schools, but yes, you can do it for municipal buildings.

750
00:58:28,061 --> 00:58:39,005
So I guess I would just amend the paper to ask that the city solicitor specifically rule on whether we can craft a process for schools, municipal buildings, or for both.

751
00:58:41,386 --> 00:58:42,406
I think that's what it says.

752
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:46,047
And I'm not opposed to change the language around, but I think that's what it says.

753
00:58:46,107 --> 00:58:48,788
And that's the, I'm not disputing the intent at all.

754
00:58:48,828 --> 00:58:50,569
Just, I want to get the answer that we're looking for.

755
00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:09,774
Just that the city solicitors specifically issue a ruling on whether the council through ordinance can craft a process for naming schools, school buildings and facilities, municipal buildings and facilities, or

756
00:59:10,993 --> 00:59:13,615
both of those categories.

757
00:59:13,655 --> 00:59:16,596
Why don't we just say something that's almost exactly what it says.

758
00:59:17,377 --> 00:59:19,118
I'm just trying to ask two questions.

759
00:59:19,758 --> 00:59:21,319
Next time I'll put you on the resolution.

760
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,081
Co sponsor and how about that?

761
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:26,102
I appreciate it.

762
00:59:26,182 --> 00:59:27,203
It feels like I'm nitpicking.

763
00:59:27,503 --> 00:59:30,024
I'm really just going back to the what you stated.

764
00:59:30,204 --> 00:59:32,526
It's almost says verbatim what you just stated.

765
00:59:33,006 --> 00:59:33,466
I hear you.

766
00:59:34,047 --> 00:59:38,449
It's going back to the question that we asked around the authority.

767
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:39,810
Now I'm blanking on it.

768
00:59:43,896 --> 00:59:48,499
the disagreement between the solicitor and the administration on a legal question on the cast.

769
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:53,082
And we asked a question and the answer came back, well, maybe, and now there's this dispute.

770
00:59:53,142 --> 00:59:54,403
I just wanna be really specific.

771
00:59:54,483 --> 00:59:56,685
And that's the only reason I'm making this point.

772
00:59:56,965 --> 01:00:00,187
Okay, I see the language is saying, but good evening.

773
01:00:00,868 --> 01:00:04,030
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

774
01:00:05,751 --> 01:00:07,593
Mr. Clerk, can we put, oh, thank you.

775
01:00:07,633 --> 01:00:10,054
Thank you, G News on 35 Parish Street.

776
01:00:10,334 --> 01:00:12,396
Councilor Marks, thank you for bringing this forward.

777
01:00:13,531 --> 01:00:20,175
As someone who works in process regularly, I was really very disheartened by the process.

778
01:00:20,255 --> 01:00:30,080
I know the folks that volunteered worked very hard, but I think we could benefit as a community by something with better shoes.

779
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,981
I would hope that we could get an answer to this.

780
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:35,602
And I think we should even be looking at our parks and other facilities as well.

781
01:00:36,283 --> 01:00:39,745
As you say, we have a habit of making,

782
01:00:41,307 --> 01:00:44,368
street corners named after folks and other areas throughout our city.

783
01:00:44,968 --> 01:00:49,290
And I think as a community, if we have a clear understanding of what the expectation is, that helps.

784
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:56,733
And then you may even see opportunity for people to step forward because it's clear what they would be volunteering exactly to do.

785
01:00:56,933 --> 01:00:59,994
So I think anytime you can put shape around a process, it's better.

786
01:01:00,434 --> 01:01:01,435
We do it for other things.

787
01:01:01,455 --> 01:01:02,675
We have multiple hearings.

788
01:01:03,115 --> 01:01:10,638
We have requirements for three hearings when we do amendments and when we're looking at implications to different

789
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:12,651
projects to the city, et cetera.

790
01:01:12,731 --> 01:01:15,573
And so this seems to dovetail into everything else we do.

791
01:01:15,934 --> 01:01:36,829
So I appreciate you bringing it forward and I appreciate your position on clarity, but I definitely think it's something that's well worth looking into because personally, I would really hate to see our community go through something like that again, if we can craft a process that just provides everybody the opportunity to be heard

792
01:01:37,282 --> 01:01:42,083
and iterative opportunity for feedback, and that didn't happen, I think, as a community.

793
01:01:42,443 --> 01:01:52,065
I think folks submitted on the issue at hand, saw what the results were, and then there was no opportunity for additional conversation.

794
01:01:52,085 --> 01:01:56,085
And I think that that was a good part of the problem.

795
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:57,565
So thank you for your time.

796
01:01:57,726 --> 01:01:58,086
Thank you.

797
01:01:58,166 --> 01:01:58,586
Thank you.

798
01:02:01,206 --> 01:02:03,366
Mr. Castaneda.

799
01:02:04,667 --> 01:02:06,447
Mr. Clerk, can you please unmute Mr. Castaneda?

800
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,501
Hold on, Andrew.

801
01:02:19,327 --> 01:02:20,167
He's not on mute.

802
01:02:21,108 --> 01:02:22,870
Okay, good evening, Andrew.

803
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:23,850
Name and address of the record.

804
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:27,834
Andrew Castaneda, yes, of East Method, Massachusetts.

805
01:02:29,415 --> 01:02:31,256
Good evening, honorable counselors.

806
01:02:32,557 --> 01:02:35,720
I wanna thank Councilor Mox for bringing up this resolution.

807
01:02:37,061 --> 01:02:38,202
I might also add

808
01:02:40,091 --> 01:02:47,717
if you could possibly add to have the facilities to add public parks and statues.

809
01:02:48,978 --> 01:02:49,899
Thank you for listening.

810
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:51,400
Thank you.

811
01:02:51,521 --> 01:02:57,466
Okay.

812
01:03:00,148 --> 01:03:08,715
So on the motion by Councilor Marks as amended by Councilor Beers seconded by so what was Councilor Beers amendment?

813
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,361
just to split the question, just split the question.

814
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:12,881
Same, same as well.

815
01:03:13,241 --> 01:03:14,381
It just, yeah.

816
01:03:14,661 --> 01:03:20,703
After the word naming of any school building or facility, municipal building or facility or both.

817
01:03:20,723 --> 01:03:23,344
Thank you.

818
01:03:23,544 --> 01:03:24,284
Seconded by.

819
01:03:25,964 --> 01:03:27,585
Seconded by Councilor Scott Fevella.

820
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:28,285
All those in favor?

821
01:03:28,345 --> 01:03:29,906
All those opposed?

822
01:03:30,486 --> 01:03:31,326
Motion passes.

823
01:03:31,346 --> 01:03:34,827
2-1-4-2-9 offered by Councilor Morrell.

824
01:03:35,207 --> 01:03:38,228
Be it so resolved that Memphis City Council congratulate Memphis residents,

825
01:03:39,488 --> 01:03:46,972
Lynnville Engler for being awarded the MIT Collier Medal for his work in the COVID-19 response.

826
01:03:47,052 --> 01:03:47,632
Councilor Morrell.

827
01:03:48,153 --> 01:03:48,933
Thank you, Mr. President.

828
01:03:49,433 --> 01:03:56,857
So Ben is the MIT System Design and Management Industry and Certificate Director and the 2021 awardee of the Collier Medal.

829
01:03:57,558 --> 01:04:03,901
So MIT gives out a number of staff excellence awards each year, which are among the highest honors to staff.

830
01:04:04,021 --> 01:04:06,983
As is the tradition, there's only one Collier Medal award winner.

831
01:04:07,507 --> 01:04:10,808
And that's Ben, her Medford neighbor, Medford resident.

832
01:04:10,968 --> 01:04:18,709
And the Collier Medal was established in 2014 to honor MIT police officer Sean Collier and his commitment to community engagement and model citizenship.

833
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:23,150
As I said, it's among the highest honors that MIT awards its staff and community members.

834
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:36,672
Ben was awarded this because in the spring of 2020, as the WHO declared COVID-19 to be an official pandemic and case numbers rose in Massachusetts, groups and individuals across MIT and the state sought ways to help

835
01:04:37,338 --> 01:04:44,412
Ben's background in the medical device industry and his training in applying a systems approach to socio-technical challenges immediately proved useful.

836
01:04:45,083 --> 01:04:55,069
And he worked closely with professors in the Department of Mechanical Engineering to navigate the rapidly evolving response across the Institute and identify labs and other groups that could join these efforts.

837
01:04:55,669 --> 01:05:06,755
So through this work, Ben connected with the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, who convened experts from a variety of fields to form what became the Massachusetts Manufacturing Emergency Response Team.

838
01:05:07,235 --> 01:05:11,778
And this collaborative, which was cross-disciplinary and cross-industry,

839
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:25,429
played a key role in the Baker-Polito administration's initial response to COVID-19, and the Massachusetts Manufacturing Emergency Response Team helped local manufacturers pivot their operations to produce PPE and other much-needed supplies for healthcare workers at scale.

840
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:37,358
And Ben helped lead the effort to provide medical device development guidance to manufacturers, and he also served as the team's key liaison with FDA officials and ensured that critical emergency regulatory requirements were addressed.

841
01:05:38,218 --> 01:05:40,420
So for these efforts, Ben was awarded the medal

842
01:05:40,890 --> 01:05:44,912
And I want to just take a moment to recognize him for this tremendous achievement.

843
01:05:44,992 --> 01:06:05,124
I know there are many, many Medford residents who contributed in many ways to the COVID-19 response, but I just want to call out this really high honor offered by MIT for his work across the state and just thank his neighbor, Laurel Ruma, for reaching out and ensuring that the community knows about one of its residents in this really important award.

844
01:06:05,804 --> 01:06:07,786
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

845
01:06:07,946 --> 01:06:08,606
Any further discussion?

846
01:06:10,025 --> 01:06:14,789
Mr. President, just if I could, I want to thank my colleagues for bringing this up.

847
01:06:14,889 --> 01:06:21,615
And you know, when you when you hear accolades like this, Mr. President, you see who is living in our community.

848
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:28,120
You know, we have a wealth of resources and untapped ability and knowledge in this community.

849
01:06:28,781 --> 01:06:34,326
And Ben would have been a great asset for this community to give guidance and so forth.

850
01:06:34,346 --> 01:06:37,008
So I think we really need to take a long look

851
01:06:37,544 --> 01:06:42,507
at our volunteer program within the community, even if one exists, I'm not sure.

852
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:55,976
And I think, you know, being, having the ability to tap into, for instance, Ben would have been invaluable during COVID and when you're discussing PPE and everything else associated with his experience and his knowledge.

853
01:06:55,996 --> 01:06:59,418
So I wanna thank Ben and I thank my colleague for bringing this up.

854
01:06:59,938 --> 01:07:00,258
Thank you.

855
01:07:00,919 --> 01:07:02,980
Okay, Vice President Banks.

856
01:07:04,736 --> 01:07:08,237
On the motion by Councilor Morrell, seconded by Vice President Knight.

857
01:07:08,717 --> 01:07:09,417
All those in favor?

858
01:07:10,357 --> 01:07:11,337
All opposed, motion passes.

859
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:21,479
On the motion for suspension of the rules by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Morrell to take paper.

860
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:22,720
Which one?

861
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:29,241
2-1-4-3-3.

862
01:07:29,421 --> 01:07:31,702
All those in favor?

863
01:07:32,482 --> 01:07:32,562
Aye.

864
01:07:32,622 --> 01:07:33,662
Opposed, motion passes.

865
01:07:37,072 --> 01:07:59,066
21433, dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request to recommend that your honorable body approve the following recommendation of the Community Preservation Committee, requesting the appropriation of $80,000 from the General Reserve to the Royal House Association for the Royal House and Slave Quarters Window and Roof Chimney Restoration Project.

866
01:08:01,787 --> 01:08:05,770
The project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund

867
01:08:06,214 --> 01:08:08,076
by category General Reserve.

868
01:08:08,336 --> 01:08:10,058
Sincerely, Brandon Lugo-Curran, Mayor.

869
01:08:11,179 --> 01:08:14,683
I do believe our CPA Administrator, Daniel Evans, is on the call, Mr. President.

870
01:08:14,963 --> 01:08:18,206
Daniel, Mr. Clerk, can you take out a new Daniel?

871
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:22,731
Good evening, Daniel.

872
01:08:22,751 --> 01:08:23,632
Name and address of the record.

873
01:08:25,133 --> 01:08:28,637
Good evening, Daniel Evans, Community Preservation Coordinator.

874
01:08:30,252 --> 01:08:36,955
I believe that the executive director of the Royal Health Association is with us tonight, is Singleton?

875
01:08:37,895 --> 01:08:38,716
Yes, yes.

876
01:08:39,736 --> 01:08:46,959
Good evening, name and address of the record.

877
01:08:47,019 --> 01:08:49,180
Kara Singleton, 175 Beacon Street.

878
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:54,242
If you give us a brief description of the project.

879
01:08:54,655 --> 01:09:03,439
Yeah, so we applied to the CPA to fix a hole that is in our roof, which is right above our archives.

880
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:19,887
So this is an emergency because too much water damage could not only destroy, cause severe damage to the building, but also destroy our institutional records, as well as rebuilding our chimney, which is failing.

881
01:09:20,688 --> 01:09:21,068
Thank you.

882
01:09:21,828 --> 01:09:22,729
Anybody have any questions?

883
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:29,472
Mr. President, I found this to be an appropriate expenditure of the community preservation funds, and I would second the approval.

884
01:09:29,652 --> 01:09:30,472
Thank you.

885
01:09:30,672 --> 01:09:35,174
On the motion by Vice President Nays, seconded by Councilor Mox, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

886
01:09:35,294 --> 01:09:36,754
Mr. President, before you call the roll.

887
01:09:37,014 --> 01:09:37,715
Councilor Mox.

888
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:40,716
Has there been any temporary work done?

889
01:09:40,796 --> 01:09:47,178
So if it is leaking now, until this work gets done, that you won't have any damage or lose documents?

890
01:09:47,658 --> 01:09:52,840
Yeah, so basically right now we have a barrel which is catching all of the,

891
01:09:53,495 --> 01:09:59,259
the water, and as soon as this is approved, the contractors will begin work.

892
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:04,462
So nothing on the top of the roof, just temporarily a top or something that could stop?

893
01:10:04,683 --> 01:10:20,714
No, when the roofers came out, there's a roof cap in the hole, so it didn't really make a lot of sense to start working on it before we could secure the funding, because to replace the roof cap is already really expensive.

894
01:10:21,534 --> 01:10:21,814
Thank you.

895
01:10:24,113 --> 01:10:24,813
Thank you, Mr. President.

896
01:10:25,294 --> 01:10:26,214
Thank you for being here tonight.

897
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:31,418
Do you know how, so once the contractor gets the okay, do we know how long the project's going to take?

898
01:10:31,778 --> 01:10:42,106
Yeah, so we are on the schedule in July to get the chimney repair, because that has to go first, and then the roof will be repaired by Old Mohawk.

899
01:10:43,026 --> 01:10:47,470
And that will happen as well, also in July, as soon as the chimney is done.

900
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:49,551
So we're thinking about it by August?

901
01:10:49,971 --> 01:10:53,494
By August, hopefully we will have it fixed.

902
01:10:54,258 --> 01:10:55,118
Thank you very much.

903
01:10:55,798 --> 01:10:55,999
Thank you.

904
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:00,760
Any further questions on the motion by vice-president seconded by council box.

905
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:02,341
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

906
01:11:02,361 --> 01:11:02,421
Yes.

907
01:11:02,441 --> 01:11:02,541
Yes.

908
01:11:02,561 --> 01:11:02,621
Yes.

909
01:11:04,981 --> 01:11:05,141
Yes.

910
01:11:05,161 --> 01:11:05,241
Yes.

911
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:05,401
Yes.

912
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:05,522
Yes.

913
01:11:05,542 --> 01:11:05,782
Yes.

914
01:11:05,802 --> 01:11:09,523
Motion to be brought back to regular business.

915
01:11:09,543 --> 01:11:10,483
Thank you.

916
01:11:23,495 --> 01:11:24,596
seconded by Councilor Scott Fevella.

917
01:11:24,616 --> 01:11:25,717
All those in favor?

918
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:26,257
Aye.

919
01:11:26,457 --> 01:11:27,078
Motion passes.

920
01:11:28,899 --> 01:11:42,510
21430, offered by Councilor Baca, be it resolved that the administration provide the Memphis City Council with the following information in regard to the private investigator that was hired by the administration on or before June 23rd, 2021.

921
01:11:43,931 --> 01:11:52,998
A copy of the signed contract for investigatory services, a description of the procurement process used for this contract, a detail of the funding source line item,

922
01:11:53,365 --> 01:12:04,489
and the scope of services to be provided, and a copy of the city ordinance that the city solicitor is relying on on the basis of the procurement and hiring by the administration for this contract.

923
01:12:04,509 --> 01:12:05,149
Councilor Falco.

924
01:12:05,849 --> 01:12:06,729
Thank you, Mr. President.

925
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:18,553
Over the last 10 days, along with my city council colleagues, I have taken actions to get answers because the residents of Medford and the city of Medford employees deserve the truth.

926
01:12:19,373 --> 01:12:20,654
Now more than ever, we must think,

927
01:12:22,393 --> 01:12:30,440
have increased awareness about the dynamics of power and vigorously pursue ways to create inclusive and competent work environments.

928
01:12:31,701 --> 01:12:46,633
Although personnel issues are not in the purview of the Medford City Council, we have the responsibility to the employees and to the citizens of Medford to maintain a community of equity and inclusion and to advocate for full transparency.

929
01:12:48,472 --> 01:12:57,337
In the instances described, Mayor Lungo-Kern and a leadership team have failed Medford and I will not stand by and allow our talented city staff to be tarnished or degraded.

930
01:12:58,397 --> 01:13:07,082
Every single city council have voted to take an independent and impartial investigation into this matter, requested appropriations from the mayor to do so.

931
01:13:09,243 --> 01:13:17,347
In a public document from Mayor Lungo-Kern to the president of the city council dated June 28th, 2021, the mayor denied this request because

932
01:13:18,299 --> 01:13:21,962
It, and I quote, is nothing more than a political ploy.

933
01:13:25,966 --> 01:13:40,478
For the mayor of the state, the council's request to seek an independent investigation regarding this matter is a political ploy, is an absolute insult, not only to the members of this council, but to the two employees making these allegations.

934
01:13:41,799 --> 01:13:44,261
The statement by the mayor downplays the seriousness

935
01:13:45,225 --> 01:13:49,547
of these allegations dismisses the integrity and reputation of the employee.

936
01:13:50,527 --> 01:13:56,010
It calls into question mayor's integrity and motivation in investigating these matters.

937
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:07,174
During the council's emergency meeting on June 23rd, city solicitor Kim Scanlon was asked to describe the process of how the third party investigator was selected.

938
01:14:08,615 --> 01:14:13,777
City solicitor Scanlon stated, and I quote, made a recommendation and listed down

939
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:18,791
to two candidates, and earlier today, the mayor agreed to the first candidate.

940
01:14:22,232 --> 01:14:27,874
This is in complete and total contrast to what the mayor stated in the June 28th letter to President Carviello.

941
01:14:28,754 --> 01:14:35,216
In that letter, the mayor stated the following, I did not participate in the selection of the third party then or now.

942
01:14:36,235 --> 01:14:47,022
A statement released to the Medford transcript by the city on June 24th, the mayor directed the city solicitor to engage the services of an independent third party selected by the city solicitor.

943
01:14:48,603 --> 01:14:52,205
And you wonder why the council sought to hire an outside counsel and an investigator.

944
01:14:53,306 --> 01:14:57,989
For the mayor to deny the council's request for funds is simply outrageous.

945
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:03,252
The resolution tonight is basically to get more information

946
01:15:03,718 --> 01:15:10,021
with regard to the private investigator that was hired by the administration on or before June 23rd, 2021.

947
01:15:10,081 --> 01:15:16,824
The bullets points state exactly what I'm looking for.

948
01:15:16,844 --> 01:15:30,170
That's a copy of the signed contract for the investigatory services, a description of the procurement process used for this contract, a detail of funding source, line item and scope of services to be provided

949
01:15:30,762 --> 01:15:38,625
and a copy of the city ordinance the city solicitor is relying on as a basis for the procurement and hiring by the administration for this contract.

950
01:15:40,306 --> 01:15:41,926
I thank you for your time and I move approval.

951
01:15:43,027 --> 01:15:43,547
Thank you.

952
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:45,448
Any further questions?

953
01:15:47,689 --> 01:15:54,271
On motion by Councilor Powell, seconded by Vice President Knight.

954
01:15:54,771 --> 01:15:55,492
All those in favor?

955
01:15:55,512 --> 01:15:55,572
Aye.

956
01:15:56,792 --> 01:15:57,492
All those opposed?

957
01:15:58,033 --> 01:15:58,773
Motion passes.

958
01:16:00,859 --> 01:16:10,464
2, 1, 4, 3, 6 offered by Councilor Baez, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the 2021 municipal preliminary election be discussed.

959
01:16:10,744 --> 01:16:11,384
Councilor Baez.

960
01:16:13,205 --> 01:16:14,185
Thank you, Mr. President.

961
01:16:15,006 --> 01:16:18,127
So the purpose of this resolution is pretty literal.

962
01:16:18,728 --> 01:16:22,690
I was hoping we could have a discussion about the 2021 municipal preliminary election.

963
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:29,653
As many residents know, from time to time during municipal election season, the city holds preliminary elections.

964
01:16:30,378 --> 01:16:40,464
In recent years, I believe they have eliminated effectively one candidate out of a pool of 15 or 16 or two from 16 for city council.

965
01:16:40,884 --> 01:16:43,726
It's a very costly exercise.

966
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:47,308
I believe it costs upwards of $50,000 of taxpayer money.

967
01:16:47,328 --> 01:16:54,913
And the outcome is really saying, well, you know, we're gonna have you pick from 14 candidates instead of 15 candidates.

968
01:16:55,617 --> 01:16:59,639
I think if that's the case, it may not be the best use of taxpayer dollars.

969
01:16:59,999 --> 01:17:04,762
I also think there's an argument that letting everybody run in the general election is a good thing.

970
01:17:04,782 --> 01:17:08,564
We're not eliminating one or two candidates from the outset.

971
01:17:09,244 --> 01:17:19,749
And I'm just interested into what my other fellow counselors think about potentially filing a home rule petition to cancel the preliminary election and just allow all candidates to run in the November general election.

972
01:17:20,590 --> 01:17:23,311
One other reason I bring this up is significant

973
01:17:24,198 --> 01:17:27,220
legislative uncertainty around the option of mail-in voting.

974
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:38,887
It seems like the legislature may not pass a law by the time necessary to allow mail ballots for the preliminary election, but then may do it in time for the general election.

975
01:17:38,967 --> 01:17:41,628
So then we're talking about a different set of rules for each election.

976
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:51,194
And I think it may just be better given the conditions that we're operating under to have the elections office focusing on making sure that the November election runs smoothly.

977
01:17:51,993 --> 01:17:53,674
Those are just some points for consideration.

978
01:17:53,694 --> 01:18:00,079
I'm interested into what my other fellow counselors think, and hopefully we can maybe take some action on it tonight.

979
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:07,685
If I can refer to the clerk for a little explanation to Councilor Behrs, any guidance?

980
01:18:09,686 --> 01:18:14,390
Councilor Behrs is correct that this would require a home repetition to be canceled.

981
01:18:15,751 --> 01:18:20,735
And the estimate of $50,000 is the number that my predecessor

982
01:18:22,707 --> 01:18:26,928
often quoted to me for the cost of a preliminary municipal election.

983
01:18:26,948 --> 01:18:32,889
That's a back of the envelope calculation, but it's one that my predecessor used and was very confident in using.

984
01:18:35,429 --> 01:18:36,729
Mr. President, nice.

985
01:18:36,769 --> 01:18:42,750
I certainly can appreciate the measure in terms of when it comes to cost savings.

986
01:18:43,671 --> 01:18:47,211
I don't think that that's necessarily a bad thing to talk about.

987
01:18:47,371 --> 01:18:51,592
I do have concern over the process and when we make this determination.

988
01:18:53,012 --> 01:18:59,353
if there's 15 candidates today, but there's 27 tomorrow, you know, where do we draw the line?

989
01:18:59,473 --> 01:19:01,053
I guess the question that I have, you know what I mean?

990
01:19:01,073 --> 01:19:02,054
Do we wait till the papers close?

991
01:19:02,074 --> 01:19:10,635
How much time do we need to get this legislation to get passed before we have to, can we do it after the paper deadline closes, but still have enough time to pass the normal petition?

992
01:19:10,735 --> 01:19:15,216
You know, those are some of the questions that are from an operational standpoint that come up.

993
01:19:15,256 --> 01:19:21,557
And I think that because of those questions in the past, we haven't really acted on a measure like this.

994
01:19:22,213 --> 01:19:30,898
that couple with the fact that the city charter defines how we're supposed to move, leaves this up to be really a philosophical argument.

995
01:19:30,998 --> 01:19:42,726
I certainly can support the idea of about $50,000 worth of cost savings, number one, and the uncertainty surrounding the ability to get the mail-in voting approved prior to the election.

996
01:19:42,746 --> 01:19:46,548
So those are things that would certainly warrant some consideration.

997
01:19:47,509 --> 01:19:49,690
And if this Home Rule petition is something that does come up,

998
01:19:50,261 --> 01:19:52,183
Those will be the items that I'm thinking about.

999
01:19:53,024 --> 01:19:58,671
I certainly don't have a problem putting the question before this body, having us deliberate that to a full extent.

1000
01:19:59,052 --> 01:20:03,477
I think that's kind of like the intent of this paper.

1001
01:20:03,497 --> 01:20:05,980
The council has put this paper forward to have a conversation.

1002
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:08,102
I certainly don't have a problem having a conversation.

1003
01:20:08,142 --> 01:20:10,325
I don't even have a problem having the whole petition drafted.

1004
01:20:10,762 --> 01:20:13,804
and having us have the opportunity to discuss and debate about the process.

1005
01:20:14,264 --> 01:20:22,809
Um, you know, so with that being said, I can support the paper this evening if we're asking for a future beating for some defined parameters on how we're going to figure this out.

1006
01:20:23,409 --> 01:20:27,632
But, you know, at the same time, a child does call for preliminary election.

1007
01:20:27,972 --> 01:20:30,734
Uh, you know, there's 15 candidates in the race.

1008
01:20:31,174 --> 01:20:33,635
Um, so it is what it is.

1009
01:20:34,276 --> 01:20:36,217
Thank you for the discussion.

1010
01:20:36,237 --> 01:20:36,717
Council morale.

1011
01:20:37,537 --> 01:20:38,978
I just want to echo vice president.

1012
01:20:39,018 --> 01:20:47,884
I think councilor bears bringing this forward, but I think I have the same concerns as far as process and timing, just understanding if the pool does grow exponentially, which it can, you know, where are we then?

1013
01:20:47,984 --> 01:20:51,586
So just can we drop this paper after the deadline?

1014
01:20:51,706 --> 01:20:56,289
Can, will we get a response in time, which I don't know if we'll get those answers until it's too late.

1015
01:20:56,649 --> 01:20:59,351
But I do think this is something that warrants for the discussion.

1016
01:20:59,371 --> 01:21:02,373
Mr. President.

1017
01:21:05,272 --> 01:21:08,535
Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleague for bringing it up.

1018
01:21:09,756 --> 01:21:15,159
The questions I would have, Mr. President, surround, you know, we're talking about city council.

1019
01:21:15,219 --> 01:21:23,145
It's very possible that if there's a third candidate into the mayor's race, that that could trigger off a preliminary election.

1020
01:21:23,785 --> 01:21:33,352
And as we all know, Mr. President, depending on the number of people running for an office has an impact on the potential impact on the outcome of that office.

1021
01:21:34,092 --> 01:21:35,572
I think there's a lot to consider.

1022
01:21:36,693 --> 01:21:46,055
Also, I think anytime a body that could be perceived as doing something self-serving is something that you have to proceed with caution.

1023
01:21:46,735 --> 01:22:02,739
And indeed, in my opinion, and I've stated this for years, the fact that the Bedford City Council is in order in the general election, an alphabetical order, and all the challenges are after us, it's a known fact that when it comes to the election process,

1024
01:22:03,346 --> 01:22:14,249
your positioning on the ballot has an impact on, you know, what you may get for votes, you know, the first and the last, and there's a whole science to this.

1025
01:22:14,949 --> 01:22:23,411
And believe me, I don't wanna be someone that may be perceived as putting forth something that may impact someone else.

1026
01:22:23,791 --> 01:22:32,993
You know, a new candidate running for public office wants to know, and a primary is, a preliminary is a good way of doing it, wants to know their strengths and weaknesses.

1027
01:22:33,474 --> 01:22:39,997
And that's an excellent way for a new candidate to say, you know what, I didn't do that well in the primary, I'm gonna focus on this area and this area.

1028
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:44,799
What you're effectively doing is taking that away from someone.

1029
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:47,761
And so there's a lot I think you have to consider.

1030
01:22:47,901 --> 01:23:00,627
It's not just, you know, the savings is great, but I would ask that when you look at an election in the community and when 30%, what's the last percentage in the municipal election, Mr. Clark?

1031
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:09,734
when 30% of the registered voters come out, we should be promoting elections, whether they're preliminary or not.

1032
01:23:10,234 --> 01:23:18,857
I mean, we should be, and I've thought about this for years, putting out banners and A-frames and getting the message out, promoting elections.

1033
01:23:18,877 --> 01:23:26,559
And I think when you start to cancel elections, I think what you see is a cheapening of the election process.

1034
01:23:27,413 --> 01:23:33,579
And, you know, so I think there's a lot, I'm not throwing this down, but I just think there's a lot to take into consideration.

1035
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:44,630
And, you know, I'm not opposed to looking at this, but I really have some reservations on any time an elected a body that has a vested interest, right?

1036
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:49,575
The finance is one thing, but you also have a vested interest in getting reelected, right?

1037
01:23:50,376 --> 01:23:58,620
And anytime you use your influence that may hinder someone else, whether you think it does or not, I mean, it's something that needs to be reviewed.

1038
01:23:58,941 --> 01:24:09,786
In the past, Mr. President, and I think a couple of years ago, there was a letter sent out by one of the candidates asking all the other candidates, what are your thoughts on canceling the primary?

1039
01:24:09,806 --> 01:24:14,208
I think there were one or two extra candidates, and why spend the money, as Councilor Beers mentioned.

1040
01:24:14,829 --> 01:24:17,130
And we got a mixed bag back from candidates.

1041
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:19,171
Some wanted to keep it, some were opposed,

1042
01:24:20,092 --> 01:24:23,073
So I think these are the discussions I think we have to have.

1043
01:24:23,113 --> 01:24:32,914
So I'm not opposed to what Vice President Knight mentioned about taking a closer look, but I'm not sold on, you know, canceling any primary at this particular point.

1044
01:24:33,374 --> 01:24:34,174
Thank you.

1045
01:24:34,875 --> 01:24:35,675
Thank you, Mr. President.

1046
01:24:36,575 --> 01:24:38,115
I'd agree with Councilor Marks as well.

1047
01:24:38,475 --> 01:24:40,976
I have a quick question through you to the clerk.

1048
01:24:43,236 --> 01:24:47,377
What's the timing as far as when would you need to have an answer to send a homeowner petition?

1049
01:24:47,397 --> 01:24:48,857
I would imagine there's a process behind that.

1050
01:24:49,416 --> 01:25:04,121
Well, the ballot, if there is a preliminary election, and it very much looks like it will be at this point, the ballot order drawing would be Friday, August 13th, I believe at nine o'clock in the morning.

1051
01:25:04,702 --> 01:25:12,304
So there would have to be some sort of, likely some sort of answer before then, because I would be ordering the ballots the next week.

1052
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:19,087
If the drawing is Friday, I wouldn't be able to get the ballots ordered on Friday, but I would definitely order them early the following week.

1053
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:20,580
Thank you.

1054
01:25:21,501 --> 01:25:22,021
Mr. President.

1055
01:25:22,641 --> 01:25:23,081
Scott Pelley.

1056
01:25:23,121 --> 01:25:24,342
Through you to the clerk.

1057
01:25:26,223 --> 01:25:31,605
With that, again, remind everybody when the last day to accept nomination papers.

1058
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:34,907
I think the last day to accept it.

1059
01:25:35,127 --> 01:25:35,667
August 10th.

1060
01:25:36,848 --> 01:25:37,068
10th?

1061
01:25:37,668 --> 01:25:39,629
No, there's a July.

1062
01:25:39,689 --> 01:25:40,670
There were July deadlines.

1063
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:45,952
There's a July 23rd deadline for the last day to pull the papers and a July 23rd deadline for the last day to return the certificate.

1064
01:25:45,972 --> 01:25:46,753
It was the last day to pull, so 26th.

1065
01:25:48,263 --> 01:25:51,746
23rd is the last day to pull, 27th is the last day to return the certified papers.

1066
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:59,592
Okay, so again, I think that I appreciate that, and I appreciate Councilor Behrs bringing that forward, because that's one thing I looked at when we first started running.

1067
01:26:00,073 --> 01:26:16,426
You look at primary, the savings is the number one thing, but I think that it's important that we still don't know what tomorrow brings, and I think it's a little too early, I think, because like Councilor Mark said, you had another candidate for the mayor's race,

1068
01:26:17,148 --> 01:26:22,950
and you don't run a primary, that can play a huge factor in what happens in this community.

1069
01:26:23,010 --> 01:26:31,013
So I think that, unfortunately, I think timing is one of the biggest issues, and I feel the same as my fellow colleagues.

1070
01:26:31,093 --> 01:26:43,518
And I appreciate listening to you, talking about it, because it is a conversation that I think a lot of people in the community ask, because as Council Member Mark said the last time, it was really 50-50, not only with the candidates, but also with the constituents.

1071
01:26:43,538 --> 01:26:45,959
I can't tell you how many times, if you don't have a primary,

1072
01:26:46,292 --> 01:26:53,894
we save a teacher and it sounds great in essence, but you know, with the process, I think that the due process that we have in place is there for a reason.

1073
01:26:53,914 --> 01:27:06,376
And I think that it's something that with the time being so congested and so questionable to move forward with eliminating is a little shaky for me.

1074
01:27:06,416 --> 01:27:07,016
So, thank you.

1075
01:27:07,836 --> 01:27:09,777
Thank you, Councilman Baez.

1076
01:27:11,117 --> 01:27:15,018
A few years ago when I was president, I think like three, four years ago, there was a 15 person race

1077
01:27:16,532 --> 01:27:18,153
I was asked to do exactly what he did.

1078
01:27:19,754 --> 01:27:25,157
All the candidates signed an affidavit saying they wanted to skip the primary.

1079
01:27:26,137 --> 01:27:37,103
And by the time of them signing it to be getting it to the clerk and the solicitor, half of them had changed their minds.

1080
01:27:37,784 --> 01:27:41,005
It does warrant some discussion in many cities.

1081
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:49,227
done away with the primaries due to cost saving, where they changed the parameter of what constitutes a primary.

1082
01:27:49,247 --> 01:27:57,154
So, again, but you're still looking at some of what seems to happen, but it does warrant some further discussion going forward.

1083
01:27:57,575 --> 01:28:02,880
And maybe everyone who turned papers in may not be picked up, may not turn their back.

1084
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:05,342
So, we'll wait and see where that goes.

1085
01:28:08,863 --> 01:28:11,584
And this is exactly what I was looking for by putting it on the way I did.

1086
01:28:11,604 --> 01:28:14,704
I just wanted to hear from everybody, hear some honest opinions about it.

1087
01:28:15,845 --> 01:28:19,665
I think the reason I put it on now is also in the timing question.

1088
01:28:20,386 --> 01:28:22,906
We start to run out of time in terms of getting it out there.

1089
01:28:23,366 --> 01:28:29,768
And it seems to me like just given the way that our election calendar is currently structured, we're probably not going to be comfortable enough.

1090
01:28:30,088 --> 01:28:31,908
I mean, there's no way we're going to get a home rule out.

1091
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:36,518
you know, in early August, have it passed by the legislature and back to us by August 13th.

1092
01:28:36,618 --> 01:28:43,284
So I would be comfortable meeting at some point in the future to discuss maybe the election calendar or how this could work in future elections.

1093
01:28:43,324 --> 01:28:47,947
And I'm sure potentially if there is ever a city charter review, it could come up during that process as well.

1094
01:28:48,468 --> 01:28:52,071
But I didn't wanna come in here guns blazing with my position on it.

1095
01:28:52,171 --> 01:28:59,977
I just wanted to see where the council stood on it because I think to Councilor Mark's point, maybe we could really

1096
01:29:00,516 --> 01:29:05,039
boost the turnout for November with that extra money, put out the A-frames, do more of that outreach.

1097
01:29:05,059 --> 01:29:10,303
And I just want to try to think creatively in the future about how we can get more people engaged in municipal elections.

1098
01:29:10,424 --> 01:29:11,264
So thank you.

1099
01:29:12,986 --> 01:29:13,666
Any further discussion?

1100
01:29:16,868 --> 01:29:22,913
On the motion by Councilor Behr, seconded by Councilor Scott Felly for further discussion.

1101
01:29:23,574 --> 01:29:24,895
I'll move to receive and place on file.

1102
01:29:24,915 --> 01:29:28,838
You want to receive and place on file after everybody turns the papers in?

1103
01:29:30,915 --> 01:29:35,558
On the motion by Councilor Behr, seconded by Councilor Scott-Berry to receive a place on file.

1104
01:29:35,578 --> 01:29:36,238
All those in favor?

1105
01:29:37,018 --> 01:29:37,118
Aye.

1106
01:29:37,719 --> 01:29:38,219
All opposed?

1107
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:39,039
Motion passes.

1108
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:45,863
Okay, before we get into the budget discussion, I think we got one more paper here.

1109
01:29:45,883 --> 01:29:45,903
2-1.

1110
01:29:57,448 --> 01:30:00,369
Okay, a motion by Vice President to take a five minute recess.

1111
01:30:01,209 --> 01:30:02,329
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1112
01:30:02,409 --> 01:30:02,969
All in favor?

1113
01:30:03,269 --> 01:30:03,369
Aye.

1114
01:30:03,549 --> 01:30:04,210
Motion passes.

1115
01:30:11,371 --> 01:30:12,272
We're going to re-adjourn.

1116
01:30:12,292 --> 01:30:12,312
2-1.

1117
01:30:12,332 --> 01:30:12,972
2-1-4-3-4.

1118
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:24,735
Dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body approves the following NW transfers for fiscal year 2021 from surplus.

1119
01:30:29,167 --> 01:30:31,708
from free cash in the amount of $357,086 to snow and ice.

1120
01:30:31,748 --> 01:30:32,808
Free cash, $521,056.08 to snow and ice.

1121
01:30:32,828 --> 01:30:33,528
Data processing, ordinary, $289.

1122
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:34,628
Law personnel,

1123
01:30:54,863 --> 01:30:57,345
$66,000 to ordinary expenses.

1124
01:30:57,845 --> 01:31:01,808
Cable, $700 to appeal to personnel.

1125
01:31:04,249 --> 01:31:06,171
Free cash, $275,000 to fire personnel.

1126
01:31:06,231 --> 01:31:09,753
Signal maintenance ordinary, $1,989 to signal maintenance personnel.

1127
01:31:09,773 --> 01:31:12,435
Building inspectors ordinary, $6,000

1128
01:31:22,888 --> 01:31:26,390
$8,004 to personnel building inspectors.

1129
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:28,871
Building inspectors ordinary, $13,000 to Chevalier ordinary.

1130
01:31:28,891 --> 01:31:29,051
Total.

1131
01:31:38,026 --> 01:31:45,611
$1,241,924.08.

1132
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:45,611
Questions on transfers?

1133
01:31:45,851 --> 01:31:47,532
Vice President Knight.

1134
01:31:47,832 --> 01:31:51,255
This is an exercise that we usually go through every year right around this time at the end of the year.

1135
01:31:51,275 --> 01:31:56,278
We close out our books, balance the budget, make sure that all the accounts have a zero balance at the end of the year.

1136
01:31:57,239 --> 01:32:04,544
Normally, when we go through this exercise, our finance director is available to provide a little bit of a background and give a presentation.

1137
01:32:04,584 --> 01:32:05,445
I'm wondering if Ms.

1138
01:32:05,465 --> 01:32:06,165
Nunley is available.

1139
01:32:06,185 --> 01:32:06,986
Yes, she is available.

1140
01:32:07,768 --> 01:32:09,350
Mr. Clerk, can you unmute that?

1141
01:32:09,390 --> 01:32:10,090
Good evening, Alicia.

1142
01:32:10,951 --> 01:32:12,392
Good evening, honorable counselors.

1143
01:32:13,813 --> 01:32:15,215
Give us a description.

1144
01:32:15,855 --> 01:32:20,539
Sure, so we're covering the snow and ice with free cash this year.

1145
01:32:20,599 --> 01:32:28,286
We didn't have any extra surplus because as you know, last year, we expected a cut in our services due to COVID.

1146
01:32:29,927 --> 01:32:34,071
We are doing a transfer into the law budget for KP law.

1147
01:32:34,828 --> 01:32:41,771
to cover KP law services and to cover some security reimbursements that we do.

1148
01:32:41,791 --> 01:32:45,573
IT had a small stipend deficit that we're covering.

1149
01:32:46,194 --> 01:32:49,235
Appeals had a small stipend deficit that we're covering.

1150
01:32:49,976 --> 01:32:55,979
Fire overtime needed to be covered because usually if he has open positions, he's able to cover his overtime.

1151
01:32:55,999 --> 01:33:00,601
But as you know, last year we had to cut a lot of the fire and police positions.

1152
01:33:00,641 --> 01:33:02,462
So we're covering that with free cash.

1153
01:33:03,762 --> 01:33:06,204
Signal maintenance had a deficit to cover overtime.

1154
01:33:07,304 --> 01:33:11,607
Building inspectors needed to cover their weights and measures stipend for two instead of one person.

1155
01:33:11,667 --> 01:33:13,608
And they had an unbudgeted sick buyback.

1156
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:17,670
And the Chevalier needed additional funding for two months of utilities.

1157
01:33:21,892 --> 01:33:22,453
Further questions?

1158
01:33:23,293 --> 01:33:23,873
Councilor Baez.

1159
01:33:25,054 --> 01:33:26,055
Thank you, Mr. President.

1160
01:33:26,375 --> 01:33:27,775
Thank you, Director Nutley-Benjamin.

1161
01:33:28,476 --> 01:33:29,356
I just had one question.

1162
01:33:29,396 --> 01:33:32,218
What's our free cash balance going to be after these transfers?

1163
01:33:34,221 --> 01:33:46,808
7,000,381,098.92.

1164
01:33:34,241 --> 01:33:46,808
And just to follow up, are we going to be adding to that at all in the fiscal 22 budget?

1165
01:33:47,729 --> 01:33:52,451
Yes, we had a spending freeze implemented early on in the year.

1166
01:33:53,172 --> 01:33:55,553
So we should have some added reserves.

1167
01:33:55,793 --> 01:33:59,656
In addition to that, at the end of the December,

1168
01:34:00,626 --> 01:34:06,749
Our number for growth was more than we'd expected, and that will also bolster our reserves.

1169
01:34:07,849 --> 01:34:08,509
Great, thank you.

1170
01:34:10,670 --> 01:34:12,251
Any further discussion on transfers?

1171
01:34:13,932 --> 01:34:16,893
With this transfer, Mr. President, are we in compliance with municipal finance law?

1172
01:34:19,034 --> 01:34:19,334
Leisha?

1173
01:34:19,854 --> 01:34:20,135
Yes.

1174
01:34:21,435 --> 01:34:21,955
Move approval.

1175
01:34:22,796 --> 01:34:25,797
On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

1176
01:34:26,837 --> 01:34:27,918
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1177
01:34:34,185 --> 01:34:34,745
Councilor Behrs.

1178
01:34:35,486 --> 01:34:35,726
Yes.

1179
01:34:36,146 --> 01:34:36,786
Councilor Falco.

1180
01:34:37,206 --> 01:34:37,466
Yes.

1181
01:34:38,187 --> 01:34:38,867
Vice President Knight.

1182
01:34:39,107 --> 01:34:39,387
Yes.

1183
01:34:39,647 --> 01:34:40,228
Councilor Marks.

1184
01:34:41,168 --> 01:34:41,428
Yes.

1185
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:42,328
Councilor Morrell.

1186
01:34:42,508 --> 01:34:42,769
Yes.

1187
01:34:43,049 --> 01:34:43,809
Councilor Scarpelli.

1188
01:34:44,109 --> 01:34:44,409
Yes.

1189
01:34:44,689 --> 01:34:45,470
President Kerrio.

1190
01:34:45,830 --> 01:34:49,892
Yes, 70 affirmative, a motion passes.

1191
01:34:49,912 --> 01:34:58,315
2-1-435, dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request or recommend that your honor body accept under Massachusetts general law chapter 44, section 53A,

1192
01:35:01,053 --> 01:35:04,775
the creation of a ARPA grant account.

1193
01:35:05,315 --> 01:35:09,617
The ARPA grant account will be used for eligible grant activities.

1194
01:35:09,738 --> 01:35:12,339
The ARPA funds will be used

1195
01:35:13,501 --> 01:35:20,726
for fiscal year 22 budget in relation to revenue losses due to COVID-19 as specified by the U.S.

1196
01:35:20,766 --> 01:35:21,167
Treasury.

1197
01:35:21,867 --> 01:35:28,092
I respectfully request that your Honorable Body appropriate $8,609,426.95 to the general fund and $3,736,503.17 to the schools revolving fund.

1198
01:35:40,648 --> 01:35:49,896
The $12,345,930.12 represent the revenue loss to the City of Medford based on U.S.

1199
01:35:49,956 --> 01:35:55,301
Treasury interim final rule calculation with a 4.1% growth factor.

1200
01:35:55,821 --> 01:35:59,705
Finance Director Alicia Nellie Benjamin is present to answer any of the City's questions.

1201
01:36:00,065 --> 01:36:02,967
For God's better, Sincerely, Brianna Longoria, Mayor.

1202
01:36:02,987 --> 01:36:05,870
Alicia, could you give us a brief synopsis on this?

1203
01:36:06,913 --> 01:36:14,676
Yes, so one of the things that we're allowed to do with the American Rescue Plan Act, also shortened as ARPA, is cover revenue losses.

1204
01:36:14,696 --> 01:36:34,303
And the way that the United States Treasury looked at it is with COVID bringing so much losses, if you calculated based on the fiscal 19 as your base year, and then looked at your calendar year 2020 with 18 months with a 4.1% growth factor, I could take the difference between what we actually collected

1205
01:36:34,777 --> 01:36:39,078
and with the 4.1%, and that's how I came up with the 12,000,345.

1206
01:36:40,079 --> 01:36:47,261
One thing the US Treasury says is to combine everything into one bucket, but mass general law and the way we do things is by different fund types.

1207
01:36:47,321 --> 01:36:59,525
And I did not feel comfortable, even though we're not given enough guidance on combining 12 million into just the general fund, because I can actually prove out the loss in the general fund and prove the losses on the school revolving funds.

1208
01:37:00,285 --> 01:37:03,926
So I split it out that way, and I have an Excel calculation and formula that

1209
01:37:04,585 --> 01:37:04,965
shows it.

1210
01:37:08,588 --> 01:37:14,152
So is it safe to say, Alicia, that we have a $12 million structural deficit?

1211
01:37:15,393 --> 01:37:17,414
Not a $12 million structural deficit.

1212
01:37:17,454 --> 01:37:23,399
What that is saying is that the $4 million that we lost from the school, they're giving it back to us.

1213
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:28,863
The money that we lost in hotel revenue and local receipts, they're giving back to us.

1214
01:37:29,745 --> 01:37:32,287
and they're applying a 4.1% growth factor.

1215
01:37:32,307 --> 01:37:44,356
So instead of us having a loss for the calendar year, they're saying if nothing had happened and the world didn't go into COVID-19, you could have expected a 4.1% growth, this is what it would look like.

1216
01:37:44,436 --> 01:37:50,860
So this is just keeping us steady, like everything's correct until we actually go back to normal.

1217
01:37:52,181 --> 01:37:57,165
Okay, and then what is the structural deficit presently if the budget were to pass this evening?

1218
01:37:58,730 --> 01:38:01,352
We don't have a structural deficit in the general fund.

1219
01:38:01,632 --> 01:38:10,739
I think the, as we spoke with the schools and with Dave Murphy, with the ESSER, then you have the ARPA, and then you have the general fund.

1220
01:38:10,759 --> 01:38:14,322
I think that with the school's increase is very large.

1221
01:38:15,102 --> 01:38:20,927
As you know, we are constricted by prop two and a half, but that,

1222
01:38:22,537 --> 01:38:24,880
3.736 that we're giving them is correct.

1223
01:38:24,961 --> 01:38:28,445
That's what their normal revolving is about 5 million.

1224
01:38:28,946 --> 01:38:30,648
Their revolving went down to one.

1225
01:38:32,371 --> 01:38:36,877
And then with what we've given them, we gave them a 2% and a 2% of the general fund.

1226
01:38:36,917 --> 01:38:37,678
So that's correct.

1227
01:38:38,835 --> 01:38:54,805
And I think what they're gonna do with their ESSER money, they just have to be careful and cautious that with their cost structure and how things are, that these are one-time federal revenues and be careful not to build a structural deficit because the usual increase really shouldn't be more than two and a half percent.

1228
01:38:55,725 --> 01:39:00,148
Right, and last year we used about $5.5 million in reserves to balance the budget, right?

1229
01:39:00,868 --> 01:39:01,248
Correct.

1230
01:39:02,309 --> 01:39:05,231
So how much money in reserves are we using this year to balance the budget?

1231
01:39:06,295 --> 01:39:10,097
We're not using any of our reserves this year, except for retained earnings.

1232
01:39:11,017 --> 01:39:23,342
The 500,000 that your honorable body approved for water and sewer to keep the taxpayers increase at 3% for the rate payers for their water and sewer, that's about it.

1233
01:39:23,703 --> 01:39:24,883
No other reserves are being used.

1234
01:39:25,863 --> 01:39:27,524
Except for this grant money, right?

1235
01:39:27,544 --> 01:39:28,485
This grant money dries up.

1236
01:39:28,505 --> 01:39:33,187
Yeah, and except for this grant money, which is restoring us back to pre-recession levels.

1237
01:39:35,667 --> 01:39:41,108
So this is non-recurring revenue after the next four years?

1238
01:39:41,148 --> 01:39:42,348
Yes, correct.

1239
01:39:42,868 --> 01:39:56,931
It ends December 31st, 2024, but they've extended it out to 26 if you decide to implement infrastructure projects because it does allow for water, sewer, and broadband projects.

1240
01:39:57,851 --> 01:39:59,291
So they've extended it.

1241
01:40:03,652 --> 01:40:03,812
So.

1242
01:40:04,695 --> 01:40:14,620
if by 2024 we don't realize this $12.34 million annually, we're going to be in a situation after this.

1243
01:40:15,321 --> 01:40:19,543
We haven't recovered, but I know the state said they expect us to recover by fiscal year 25.

1244
01:40:19,603 --> 01:40:21,524
That's what Massachusetts state expects.

1245
01:40:21,564 --> 01:40:23,225
So I didn't buy that time.

1246
01:40:23,245 --> 01:40:23,865
12 31 24 would be fiscal year 25.

1247
01:40:23,965 --> 01:40:24,546
But if we don't

1248
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:30,763
recover, then we're looking at a situation where we might have.

1249
01:40:31,003 --> 01:40:37,689
Yeah, if we didn't recover, then yes, we'd be looking at a situation where we'd be looking at what we need to do, just like we did when COVID first hit.

1250
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:43,334
So what's the plan in terms of between now and then to bolster our reserve in case we don't recover?

1251
01:40:44,735 --> 01:40:48,739
So as we did this year, we implemented a freeze in January to bolster our reserves.

1252
01:40:51,014 --> 01:40:55,856
So we're not intending on spending any more of our reserves unless it's for capital needs.

1253
01:40:57,637 --> 01:41:01,118
We are very good at looking at our spending and not overspending.

1254
01:41:01,979 --> 01:41:08,642
Usually we're able to absorb the snow and ice deficit into the general fund operations because there's a surplus.

1255
01:41:08,942 --> 01:41:10,263
That's how well managed it is.

1256
01:41:11,263 --> 01:41:13,784
But because of COVID, we had to use our free cash reserves.

1257
01:41:15,765 --> 01:41:16,285
Thank you very much.

1258
01:41:18,306 --> 01:41:19,547
Any further discussion on the transfers?

1259
01:41:21,582 --> 01:41:28,244
Okay, on the motion, this was on the motion.

1260
01:41:28,264 --> 01:41:29,564
I have one more question, Mr. President.

1261
01:41:29,845 --> 01:41:31,905
This looks like it's a two questions.

1262
01:41:31,945 --> 01:41:35,206
It says one, will you create the AFA grant account two, will you appropriate the money?

1263
01:41:35,246 --> 01:41:35,886
Is that correct?

1264
01:41:36,907 --> 01:41:37,667
That is correct.

1265
01:41:38,847 --> 01:41:40,008
Will we need to take two votes?

1266
01:41:45,329 --> 01:41:47,770
If your body thinks you need to take two votes, I'm fine with that.

1267
01:41:49,516 --> 01:41:50,996
I think one's a spending paper.

1268
01:41:51,016 --> 01:41:56,757
So that the account was created and then we could transfer the funds directly out of the account into their correct places.

1269
01:41:56,837 --> 01:41:58,978
But if it should be two, I'm absolutely fine with that.

1270
01:41:58,998 --> 01:42:02,258
I think one requires five and one requires four.

1271
01:42:02,278 --> 01:42:06,019
So the question should be split.

1272
01:42:06,039 --> 01:42:07,419
Yes, we can do it in two different questions.

1273
01:42:09,980 --> 01:42:11,540
First question, Mr. President, to create the fund.

1274
01:42:12,640 --> 01:42:15,541
So on the motion by Vice President Knight,

1275
01:42:18,122 --> 01:42:21,483
Move approval on the first question, seconded by second, second, right?

1276
01:42:21,523 --> 01:42:22,203
Council of bears.

1277
01:42:22,903 --> 01:42:28,445
Uh, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll council bears.

1278
01:42:28,585 --> 01:42:28,845
Yes.

1279
01:42:29,805 --> 01:42:30,445
Councilor Falco.

1280
01:42:30,485 --> 01:42:30,765
Yes.

1281
01:42:30,785 --> 01:42:32,045
Vice president night.

1282
01:42:32,105 --> 01:42:32,426
Yes.

1283
01:42:32,886 --> 01:42:33,466
Councilor Marks.

1284
01:42:33,546 --> 01:42:33,886
Yes.

1285
01:42:34,326 --> 01:42:34,926
Councilor Morrell.

1286
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:35,306
Yes.

1287
01:42:36,246 --> 01:42:36,567
Yes.

1288
01:42:37,647 --> 01:42:37,867
Yes.

1289
01:42:37,887 --> 01:42:38,127
Seven.

1290
01:42:38,187 --> 01:42:38,607
Affirmative.

1291
01:42:38,647 --> 01:42:41,688
Motion passes a motion on the second question.

1292
01:42:42,108 --> 01:42:46,229
Move approval on the motion by councilor bears second and by

1293
01:42:49,237 --> 01:42:50,318
Second by Councilor Morrell.

1294
01:42:50,338 --> 01:42:52,379
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1295
01:42:57,662 --> 01:42:58,223
Councilor Behrs?

1296
01:42:58,383 --> 01:42:58,603
Yes.

1297
01:42:58,903 --> 01:42:59,504
Councilor Falco?

1298
01:42:59,524 --> 01:42:59,584
Yes.

1299
01:43:00,184 --> 01:43:00,884
Vice President Knight?

1300
01:43:04,947 --> 01:43:05,487
Councilor Marks?

1301
01:43:05,567 --> 01:43:05,828
Yes.

1302
01:43:06,168 --> 01:43:06,728
Councilor Morrell?

1303
01:43:06,928 --> 01:43:07,128
Yes.

1304
01:43:07,409 --> 01:43:08,129
Councilor Scarpelli?

1305
01:43:08,189 --> 01:43:08,489
Yes.

1306
01:43:08,669 --> 01:43:09,470
President Kerrio?

1307
01:43:09,570 --> 01:43:09,750
Yes.

1308
01:43:09,790 --> 01:43:10,651
Seven in the affirmative.

1309
01:43:11,131 --> 01:43:12,112
Motion passes.

1310
01:43:13,212 --> 01:43:13,673
Okay.

1311
01:43:15,234 --> 01:43:15,734
Go to

1312
01:43:24,164 --> 01:43:29,486
2-1-4-0-3, fiscal year 2022 budget submission.

1313
01:43:30,046 --> 01:43:42,551
Dear Mr. President, members of the City Council, pursuant to Mass General Law, Chapter 44, Section 32, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approve the fiscal year 2022 budget as submitted.

1314
01:43:42,871 --> 01:43:47,373
The total submitted appropriation for all departments, including schools, is $191 million, 642.

1315
01:43:52,218 --> 01:43:54,479
Account details are included with the budget presentation.

1316
01:43:54,519 --> 01:43:58,401
That number was off, Mr. President.

1317
01:43:59,482 --> 01:44:00,883
Oh, excuse me.

1318
01:44:00,903 --> 01:44:01,503
The new number is $191,900.

1319
01:44:02,263 --> 01:44:03,344
Is that the right number?

1320
01:44:03,444 --> 01:44:04,264
No, yeah.

1321
01:44:04,284 --> 01:44:04,264
$191,935,610.

1322
01:44:04,424 --> 01:44:11,068
Account details are included therein, and it's available electronically via the city website.

1323
01:44:24,102 --> 01:44:26,664
Okay, so do we wanna go over line by line?

1324
01:44:26,984 --> 01:44:27,504
Mr. President.

1325
01:44:28,385 --> 01:44:29,166
Vice President Mayne.

1326
01:44:29,186 --> 01:44:41,314
This council did make a request that line item 10153502 be reduced in the amount of $81,600 and that fund be reappropriated to part-time or full-time salaries in the law department.

1327
01:44:41,394 --> 01:44:43,636
I do not believe we received an answer to that question.

1328
01:44:43,816 --> 01:44:48,139
Is there anybody available that could give us an answer to that question as to whether or not this recommendation would be taken up?

1329
01:44:51,922 --> 01:44:52,262
Madam Mayor.

1330
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:57,083
Good evening, welcome Madam Mayor.

1331
01:44:57,123 --> 01:44:59,945
This is surrounding contract and legal services for the city council.

1332
01:45:00,266 --> 01:45:02,608
Good evening, Mr. President, members of the city council.

1333
01:45:03,689 --> 01:45:07,952
I don't know if that was a vote to reduce it or was that a recommendation?

1334
01:45:07,992 --> 01:45:10,614
It was a request, a recommendation to your office to make.

1335
01:45:10,674 --> 01:45:12,076
We made a recommendation to your office.

1336
01:45:12,336 --> 01:45:15,539
We were wondering if that recommendation would be something that would be taken up.

1337
01:45:15,579 --> 01:45:19,962
There was no response and that wasn't included in the correspondence that your office forwarded to us.

1338
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:26,882
That's not something we're gonna take into account unless you reduce the line item.

1339
01:45:26,922 --> 01:45:31,564
We sent over as many possible answers that we could.

1340
01:45:31,584 --> 01:45:41,549
I know you've got some late today with regards to diversity and human resources, as well as the election coordinated position, which I know is two big sticking points.

1341
01:45:42,309 --> 01:45:47,431
So those two, we do wanna collaborate and we have split the two offices.

1342
01:45:49,509 --> 01:45:56,754
chief people officer with its own budget, as well as diversity office with their own budget.

1343
01:45:56,774 --> 01:45:59,316
My concern at this point is with the legal office.

1344
01:45:59,556 --> 01:46:05,039
I know that we got a correspondence about the other stuff, but the question that I have pertains just to this particular request.

1345
01:46:05,620 --> 01:46:17,148
The request was that we recommend that the line be reduced and that the administration reallocate those funds voluntarily to the full-time or part-time salaries in the office, so that we would have an assistant city solicitor in the office.

1346
01:46:17,188 --> 01:46:18,388
That was the question that was asked.

1347
01:46:20,050 --> 01:46:23,912
We recommended that the administration do this voluntarily, and we didn't receive a response.

1348
01:46:24,652 --> 01:46:28,434
If the response from the administration has now reduced the line item, then I'll offer that motion right now.

1349
01:46:29,314 --> 01:46:30,194
To reduce the line item.

1350
01:46:30,215 --> 01:46:32,576
My response is, you obviously can take that vote.

1351
01:46:32,736 --> 01:46:34,356
I'm asking you not to take that vote.

1352
01:46:34,536 --> 01:46:40,739
We have a city solicitor that has been, was acting for a very long time.

1353
01:46:40,799 --> 01:46:43,340
She is now the city solicitor for the city.

1354
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:49,143
We have Kopelman and Page, who we are working with a contract on.

1355
01:46:50,394 --> 01:46:54,597
And they also are taking over all our negotiations with us.

1356
01:46:54,698 --> 01:46:56,399
It's a great price per month.

1357
01:46:56,479 --> 01:47:11,770
They have 45 experienced attorneys that are there for myself, the city and the council at any time, whether that be 5G, zoning, ordinances, they are amazing at what they do.

1358
01:47:11,910 --> 01:47:16,133
And they've been able to move the city forward faster than I've ever seen before.

1359
01:47:16,313 --> 01:47:18,695
And they're here to help the council as well, anytime.

1360
01:47:19,513 --> 01:47:22,675
It's very encouraging that we now hear that we have the ability to talk to Copeland and Page.

1361
01:47:22,956 --> 01:47:28,600
We've been asking for two years for draft ordinances to be sent to us, and they've taken an inordinate amount of time.

1362
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:38,887
With that being said- If I may, every answer from City Solicitor Kim Scanlon comes to my office, and she does respond to every request from the Council.

1363
01:47:38,927 --> 01:47:47,974
If there's more detail that you need, she's available, and if she wants to pass it on to Copeland and Page, or you would like her to, I'm sure she'd be amenable.

1364
01:47:49,882 --> 01:47:58,364
I'll just use an example of the short-term lodging ordinance that we asked for in January of 2020, and we still haven't received.

1365
01:47:58,424 --> 01:48:03,145
So we had to use Mr. Boborowski, our outside counsel, to provide that documentation to us.

1366
01:48:04,345 --> 01:48:06,725
I'm not going to go tip the tab, Mr. President, on this issue.

1367
01:48:07,346 --> 01:48:08,966
This is something the council's made a priority.

1368
01:48:09,006 --> 01:48:10,266
We've asked for our own legal counsel.

1369
01:48:10,286 --> 01:48:12,146
We've not been able to secure that.

1370
01:48:12,987 --> 01:48:14,887
That's a line item that we've asked for in our budget.

1371
01:48:15,887 --> 01:48:19,768
I also made a case that we should have an assistant city solicitor in this community

1372
01:48:20,346 --> 01:48:21,207
um, not outsourced.

1373
01:48:21,687 --> 01:48:23,409
Um, that's something that I feel very strongly about.

1374
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:38,843
Um, so with that being said, I'd make a motion right now for a council vote that contracted legal services line item 010151530200 be reduced in the amount of $81,600 president.

1375
01:48:40,205 --> 01:48:40,905
Uh, council marks.

1376
01:48:41,686 --> 01:48:42,627
Thank you, Mr President.

1377
01:48:42,827 --> 01:48:44,929
And I appreciate the mayor being here tonight

1378
01:48:45,367 --> 01:49:02,196
So Madam Mayor, the response that we received from the administration answering some of our questions, the request for 50,000 for legal services, some of us read it as we're not receiving it and others read it as we are receiving it.

1379
01:49:02,296 --> 01:49:04,377
So I was just wondering if you could clarify.

1380
01:49:04,977 --> 01:49:07,679
If there's a specific request, if you need to

1381
01:49:08,705 --> 01:49:30,481
work on something specifically like we did suing the Board of Appeals, you will be provided the money, just like with your zoning consultant, you're provided 40,000 for that work, but just a blanket 50,000 for legal consultant for the council, I think that could create a conflict of interest because Solicitor Scanlon is our city solicitor.

1382
01:49:30,841 --> 01:49:35,485
She works with the council, she works with the mayor's office, she works with the city and all department heads.

1383
01:49:36,147 --> 01:49:50,299
So that being- Her opinion stands, so it could create a conflict, but if you needed money, just like you did for the zoning consultant, which we were happy to give you, and you've been working diligently on that, then we'll take it by case by case basis.

1384
01:49:50,499 --> 01:49:59,186
So that being said then, Copeland and Page, KP Law, seem to be additional legal counsel for the administration.

1385
01:50:00,287 --> 01:50:04,230
They're working as consultants with Kim,

1386
01:50:05,633 --> 01:50:12,854
Right, but when Mr. Silverman was here, or Jonathan was here, I forget his last name, we asked him, who do you work for?

1387
01:50:12,874 --> 01:50:15,815
Do you work for the city council, the city of Metro, the city administration?

1388
01:50:15,975 --> 01:50:17,815
And he said, we work for the mayor's office.

1389
01:50:18,075 --> 01:50:18,875
That was his response.

1390
01:50:19,015 --> 01:50:23,576
So the only reason why I ask is I agree, the city solicitor is the law of the land.

1391
01:50:24,276 --> 01:50:33,418
And we actually have something before us that the city solicitor rendered an opinion, and the city administration is doubting the opinion of the city solicitor.

1392
01:50:34,228 --> 01:50:42,655
So, but right, but if we're talking about a potential conflict, then you have KP law, which is an outside entity, right?

1393
01:50:43,696 --> 01:50:46,038
Kim's the city solicitor.

1394
01:50:46,078 --> 01:50:50,422
So she, her decision rules, she gets backup from KP law.

1395
01:50:50,462 --> 01:50:57,527
Not according to your chief of staff, because he's debating on a question or an opinion that was issued by the city solicitor.

1396
01:50:58,228 --> 01:51:00,590
And that was regarding the CAFs and so forth.

1397
01:51:01,406 --> 01:51:06,110
And it's still being debated now, I guess, that he's waiting for questions to be answered.

1398
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:09,912
But that was a legal opinion issue by the city solicitor.

1399
01:51:10,213 --> 01:51:14,536
So I'm just a little dumbfounded because the school committee has an attorney.

1400
01:51:15,076 --> 01:51:23,722
And when I was on the school committee, we had an attorney we can go to as a school committee, but the council doesn't have any recourse regarding legal matters.

1401
01:51:24,303 --> 01:51:27,665
And there are times where there could be potential conflict of interest.

1402
01:51:28,826 --> 01:51:29,867
And we've had that in the past.

1403
01:51:30,424 --> 01:51:39,149
I mean, we had an issue with billboards and we were on the council at the time, where the city solicitor was representing the administration and no one was representing the council.

1404
01:51:39,649 --> 01:51:59,200
So I think all this council is asking for is a line item in those particular circumstances where we feel that there may be a potential conflict, not to surpass the city solicitor, she does a tremendous job, but in times that we feel necessary that we have to have legal advice

1405
01:51:59,796 --> 01:52:00,477
as a council.

1406
01:52:01,097 --> 01:52:08,844
And I really can't fathom why the city administration would feel so intimidated that, you know, we have legal representation.

1407
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:12,787
And so no one's trying to circumvent.

1408
01:52:13,407 --> 01:52:17,330
Also, KP law was brought in at $60,000 a year.

1409
01:52:17,931 --> 01:52:23,235
From what we found out in this budget process, they have billed us over $150,000 for this past fiscal year.

1410
01:52:23,716 --> 01:52:24,556
So this great $5,000 a month

1411
01:52:28,383 --> 01:52:37,845
No longer seems like a great $5,000 a month, because as was stated, that covers certain, you know, legal representation.

1412
01:52:38,205 --> 01:52:44,626
And I'm sure they've been requested by the city administration or other departments to assist in other things beyond that capacity.

1413
01:52:44,946 --> 01:52:45,686
So now we're looking at 150,000.

1414
01:52:45,746 --> 01:52:55,908
And as this council stated, we could probably put on an assistant city solicitor full time, as the office always existed, right?

1415
01:52:55,928 --> 01:52:57,488
There's always been as far as I remember,

1416
01:52:57,858 --> 01:53:00,659
There's always been a solicitor and assistant city solicitor.

1417
01:53:00,759 --> 01:53:08,121
And outside attorneys to handle workman's comp and engineering contracts and anything in energy and environment.

1418
01:53:08,821 --> 01:53:18,003
I don't doubt that, but it seems that KPLR is really now, I think they've issued, correct me if I'm wrong, they've actually issued legal opinions in the community.

1419
01:53:18,883 --> 01:53:22,264
And correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember seeing them issue legal opinions.

1420
01:53:22,364 --> 01:53:26,185
And the only one that can issue a legal opinion in this community is the city solicitor.

1421
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:37,885
So I think they've been utilized in a way that really, if it's infringing on anyone, it has been on our law office and possibly substituting for our law office.

1422
01:53:38,365 --> 01:53:40,826
So I would hope you just reconsider.

1423
01:53:40,986 --> 01:53:46,409
So this doesn't call for 50,000 line items in our budget for legal services.

1424
01:53:46,469 --> 01:53:47,009
No, it does not.

1425
01:53:47,369 --> 01:53:53,352
Okay, so that was a major sticking point for me and it's been a major sticking point for years.

1426
01:53:53,412 --> 01:53:55,593
So just so you know, I thought,

1427
01:53:56,635 --> 01:54:00,276
we were getting the $50,000 for legal services.

1428
01:54:01,257 --> 01:54:06,198
But at this point, I'll rest, Mr. President.

1429
01:54:07,479 --> 01:54:12,180
You know, the issue of this conflict of interest can be addressed very, very easily.

1430
01:54:12,961 --> 01:54:20,063
And it could be addressed very easily by recreating an assistant city solicitor position to the City Council in a part-time role.

1431
01:54:21,055 --> 01:54:34,905
that provides the council with the direction and advice and guidance that it's looking for in a confidential matter as their client, while also reporting to the city solicitor to be sure that it falls in line with the solicitor's opinions relative to legal questions and the like.

1432
01:54:35,706 --> 01:54:38,327
So with that being said, that's why I offer the amendment, Mr. President.

1433
01:54:38,788 --> 01:54:39,768
That's why I offer the amendment.

1434
01:54:39,828 --> 01:54:45,412
I think it's a race to the bottom and we outsource every type of decision-making process in government.

1435
01:54:45,793 --> 01:54:47,994
We have no institutional knowledge, no control, no direction.

1436
01:54:49,295 --> 01:54:50,276
And that's why I offer the amendment.

1437
01:54:50,988 --> 01:54:56,671
I offer the amendment to reduce the line item so that we can hire an assistant city solicitor in a part-time basis to represent this council on issues like that.

1438
01:54:57,092 --> 01:55:01,354
And that'll address the issues of conflict of interest because they'll report to the city solicitor.

1439
01:55:01,594 --> 01:55:08,959
There'll be our legal counsel that will provide us with confidential advice, but at the same time, they will report to the city solicitor and the city solicitor's opinions will control.

1440
01:55:09,259 --> 01:55:13,342
They won't be able to issue contradictory opinions because there'll be an employee in the solicitor's office.

1441
01:55:13,682 --> 01:55:16,964
They'll just be assigned the task of working with the council.

1442
01:55:17,844 --> 01:55:18,525
But Councilor Knight,

1443
01:55:19,077 --> 01:55:29,661
You do get direction from Solicitor Scanlon, and if she needs backup, and when she needs backup, she'll, from a specialist, she'll go to KP Law.

1444
01:55:30,061 --> 01:55:30,762
Wait, was she Friday?

1445
01:55:32,622 --> 01:55:34,063
You had a solicitor here Friday.

1446
01:55:34,083 --> 01:55:34,843
You did?

1447
01:55:35,383 --> 01:55:42,086
Yeah, I mean, Mark Rumley served as the solicitor, the advisor, the resolution writer.

1448
01:55:42,446 --> 01:55:44,887
So he has the right to provide legal opinions now for the city of Medford?

1449
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:47,382
You took his advice.

1450
01:55:47,582 --> 01:55:48,362
You took his advice.

1451
01:55:48,763 --> 01:55:55,168
So I'm just wondering why the solicitor, why we didn't have the solicitor present when we requested their presence.

1452
01:55:55,188 --> 01:55:58,711
The city solicitor was traveling on a vacation.

1453
01:55:59,952 --> 01:56:00,812
She was not present.

1454
01:56:00,833 --> 01:56:05,857
I don't know if it was 48 hours in advance notice is sometimes not enough time for our department heads.

1455
01:56:06,937 --> 01:56:07,538
Thank you very much.

1456
01:56:07,558 --> 01:56:08,599
I'm glad that we're a priority.

1457
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:10,340
Councilor Best.

1458
01:56:10,861 --> 01:56:11,581
Thank you, Mr. President.

1459
01:56:11,601 --> 01:56:12,782
Thank you, Madam Mayor, for being here.

1460
01:56:14,140 --> 01:56:22,922
just two questions on the law department or one question one comment with the way that the budget is structured now, KP law will be reporting to Kim stand to the city solicitor.

1461
01:56:23,222 --> 01:56:23,522
Okay.

1462
01:56:24,322 --> 01:56:40,826
And then I don't disagree with you councilor and on the principle of having in-house folks from the discussion I remember having with solicitor Stanley here, the issue was that there's not enough, but she feels like if she were to do it in the house, she would need two full-time city solicitors.

1463
01:56:41,587 --> 01:56:42,147
The 81,000 is not enough.

1464
01:56:43,787 --> 01:56:46,087
to hire two full-time solicitors.

1465
01:56:46,287 --> 01:56:50,468
And therefore she feels like in order to get the workload complete, this is the best arrangement of funds.

1466
01:56:51,148 --> 01:56:53,129
So that's what I heard from the solicitor herself.

1467
01:56:53,989 --> 01:56:57,949
And I think that's what I'm gonna go with on this one.

1468
01:56:58,690 --> 01:57:00,190
That's just my position on it.

1469
01:57:00,330 --> 01:57:13,172
I definitely would hope that the administration and the solicitor's office, the law department would advocate to create a plan to have in-house, two in-house assistants to the solicitors or whatever amount of in-house staff is needed

1470
01:57:14,053 --> 01:57:14,753
accomplish the work.

1471
01:57:15,133 --> 01:57:17,774
But I understand that that's not possible at the current time.

1472
01:57:17,894 --> 01:57:19,435
So that's, that's where I am on this.

1473
01:57:20,075 --> 01:57:27,818
And I can appreciate I can appreciate them as the president at the end of the day, it's been a four year legislative priority for the council to attain legal counsel for the council.

1474
01:57:27,838 --> 01:57:29,218
It's been a four year legislative priority.

1475
01:57:29,678 --> 01:57:34,500
It's been put out as part of our council priorities during that time.

1476
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,561
I may just point out there is case law.

1477
01:57:37,621 --> 01:57:42,163
I know that the Boston City Council tried to get their own attorney and I believe

1478
01:57:44,270 --> 01:57:53,052
Supreme Judicial Court stated they weren't able to, so proving the conflict of interest that would arise.

1479
01:57:53,472 --> 01:58:00,393
So I just, I have faith in our city solicitor, Kimberly Scanlon, to be able to advise the council and the city at the same time.

1480
01:58:01,053 --> 01:58:02,853
Mr. President, point of information.

1481
01:58:02,913 --> 01:58:04,374
Point of information, Council President.

1482
01:58:04,414 --> 01:58:10,055
With all due respect, it seems like the only one that's getting legal advice in the city is the city administration.

1483
01:58:10,075 --> 01:58:12,575
They get KP Law at their beck and call,

1484
01:58:13,453 --> 01:58:15,295
and they have the city solicitor.

1485
01:58:15,875 --> 01:58:25,423
So with all due respect, I think all we're doing is asking that when issues arise, that we need that same ability.

1486
01:58:25,463 --> 01:58:26,324
That's all we're asking.

1487
01:58:26,684 --> 01:58:29,167
No one's asking to cut out KP law, Mr. President.

1488
01:58:29,707 --> 01:58:37,594
And if there's a new fandango way of providing in-house legal services, that's better than how we've done it for years,

1489
01:58:38,371 --> 01:58:44,053
I want to listen to it, but we've always had a city solicitor and an assistant city solicitor since I've been on.

1490
01:58:44,193 --> 01:58:47,234
I mean, so we're not asking to recreate the wheel.

1491
01:58:47,834 --> 01:58:55,976
And I think what we're seeing now is the moving away from having an assistant city solicitor and the hiring of an outside company, which is fine.

1492
01:58:55,996 --> 01:58:58,437
That's the mayor and the administration's prerogative.

1493
01:58:59,017 --> 01:59:01,798
And we're not looking to cut them out of the budget.

1494
01:59:02,238 --> 01:59:07,640
All we're saying is that we'd like to see how it's operated in the past with assistant city solicitor.

1495
01:59:08,115 --> 01:59:12,998
And that way we can have multiple legal opinions that actually trickle down to the council.

1496
01:59:13,538 --> 01:59:16,040
Because I can just tell you, it's not happening now.

1497
01:59:16,360 --> 01:59:20,302
When we have any type of legal question, we're not able to get answers.

1498
01:59:21,783 --> 01:59:23,944
Sometimes we are, but other times we're not, Mr. President.

1499
01:59:24,064 --> 01:59:25,805
So I think that's the concern.

1500
01:59:25,865 --> 01:59:33,990
And if there's some type of federal statute or state statute or whatever says that we can't do it, I'd like to see it and discuss it.

1501
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:37,392
Because I'm not sure why we couldn't have

1502
01:59:38,266 --> 01:59:44,449
legal advice, Mr. President, in-house legal advice that works with the council.

1503
01:59:44,489 --> 01:59:45,109
That's all we're asking.

1504
01:59:45,129 --> 01:59:47,410
We're not asking to go outside of the city.

1505
01:59:47,650 --> 01:59:54,253
We're not asking to do anything and having someone legally that, I mean, Kim Scanlon's one person, one person.

1506
01:59:54,573 --> 01:59:59,656
She works with every board and commission, every department, police, fire, DPW.

1507
01:59:59,976 --> 02:00:07,119
I'm sure she gets questioned sometimes, even on the school side, even though they have their own lawyer that's been there for a number of years.

1508
02:00:07,549 --> 02:00:11,831
So that's one city solicitor, and I agree, that's not enough for the entire city.

1509
02:00:12,591 --> 02:00:19,654
But I also rather see it in-house than outsourcing, and that figure keeps growing, the outsourcing figure, and I'd rather see it done in-house.

1510
02:00:20,194 --> 02:00:21,254
That's all I'm saying, Mr. President.

1511
02:00:21,655 --> 02:00:22,755
Councilor Papantonio.

1512
02:00:22,975 --> 02:00:25,776
Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Mayor Long and Clerk, for being here tonight.

1513
02:00:26,677 --> 02:00:28,817
I do agree with my colleagues.

1514
02:00:28,977 --> 02:00:35,320
I think I've always been a big supporter of having these services right here in City Hall,

1515
02:00:35,781 --> 02:00:38,102
with people that are familiar with that community.

1516
02:00:38,323 --> 02:00:40,884
I mean, I know KP Law has vast experience in different areas.

1517
02:00:41,144 --> 02:00:41,785
I understand that.

1518
02:00:42,285 --> 02:00:48,209
But when I look at the way it's been set up in the past, we had a city solicitor, an assistant city solicitor.

1519
02:00:48,689 --> 02:01:01,597
They were extremely familiar with what was going on in the community, what projects were going on and the institutional knowledge that comes with working for a city for a long time.

1520
02:01:02,118 --> 02:01:03,859
And I think that's extremely valuable

1521
02:01:04,584 --> 02:01:12,509
And I mean, I know myself, I like to see a city solicitor, assistant city solicitor, full-time jobs here in the law office.

1522
02:01:13,070 --> 02:01:14,551
I look at the council now more than ever.

1523
02:01:15,051 --> 02:01:19,834
You take a look at the last two years, three years, four years, go back and you take a look.

1524
02:01:20,134 --> 02:01:25,638
We are busier now, helping to draft ordinances and whatnot.

1525
02:01:25,718 --> 02:01:29,260
And the solicitor's office has been very helpful without a doubt.

1526
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:33,583
So I'm not saying that they haven't been, but there's a lot of demand

1527
02:01:34,165 --> 02:01:40,589
for that one person to be at, like council member said, there's all kinds of meetings that that person needs to be at.

1528
02:01:41,069 --> 02:01:43,511
And I feel like we need legal help more than ever now.

1529
02:01:44,471 --> 02:01:50,135
And if you take a look at what we did the discussions on the marijuana ordinance, we had KP law alien camp.

1530
02:01:50,675 --> 02:01:52,516
So it was almost like a duplication of efforts.

1531
02:01:53,037 --> 02:02:01,362
So to me, it's like, I'd rather have city solicitors office with the city solicitor and at least the city assistant city solicitor that's helping us out.

1532
02:02:01,842 --> 02:02:02,463
As far as the,

1533
02:02:04,036 --> 02:02:05,757
the line item for the legal services.

1534
02:02:06,117 --> 02:02:09,359
I think, you know, we should have an attorney that helps us out.

1535
02:02:09,639 --> 02:02:11,981
You know, there's all kinds of questions that we had during our meetings.

1536
02:02:12,521 --> 02:02:20,025
And, you know, we usually don't have a city solicitor here to, you know, if we want to ask a question about anything in particular.

1537
02:02:20,525 --> 02:02:27,509
It'd be good to have someone here in advance if we, you know, if we know something's coming up that night, that option would be great to have.

1538
02:02:27,629 --> 02:02:33,172
You know, the way I look at the way this is written here, and I appreciate the effort, but I feel like,

1539
02:02:33,650 --> 02:02:39,833
You know, if it's something that we think we need an attorney for, and maybe if you didn't agree with it, you'd say no.

1540
02:02:40,013 --> 02:02:50,499
And I feel like, you know, if we want an attorney for something, we should, as a body, we should be able to determine whether or not we needed an attorney for a certain situation.

1541
02:02:50,699 --> 02:02:51,699
That's the way I feel about it.

1542
02:02:51,719 --> 02:02:55,681
I'd love to see an extra person in the city solicitor's office.

1543
02:02:55,742 --> 02:03:02,385
I think, you know, I look at what we're paying KP law now, and we're paying KP law now more than we pay camp.

1544
02:03:03,172 --> 02:03:05,012
And to me, that's a concern.

1545
02:03:05,052 --> 02:03:09,453
That number keeps going up, and I think it's probably gonna go up over time.

1546
02:03:09,513 --> 02:03:14,855
And as we go get further, it's everything that's going on with the city, there's always legal things that come up.

1547
02:03:15,015 --> 02:03:24,077
And I think that that KP law demand is going to be more and more, and I'd rather see money put into the full-time employees here in the law office.

1548
02:03:24,697 --> 02:03:24,997
Thank you.

1549
02:03:26,337 --> 02:03:26,617
Thank you.

1550
02:03:26,657 --> 02:03:27,757
And let me know if I could ask a question.

1551
02:03:27,978 --> 02:03:29,978
Would it be possible

1552
02:03:31,265 --> 02:03:35,528
through the KPLR agreement that the council be assigned an attorney to them.

1553
02:03:36,789 --> 02:03:39,331
I can bring that back to them and see if that's possible.

1554
02:03:39,351 --> 02:03:42,353
Is that something that the council would be able to do?

1555
02:03:42,533 --> 02:03:49,418
Or work something out with the solicitor that they come and represent the council on, depending on what issue it is.

1556
02:03:50,999 --> 02:03:56,302
Rather than have, I think that you'll have to call a different attorney every time.

1557
02:03:56,482 --> 02:04:00,405
If we could be assigned one particular attorney and let that attorney

1558
02:04:00,883 --> 02:04:08,067
refer the questions around the KP of our office, rather than having us to maneuver around the KP law system.

1559
02:04:08,567 --> 02:04:09,988
That's something I can discuss that.

1560
02:04:10,568 --> 02:04:12,309
I can discuss that.

1561
02:04:12,329 --> 02:04:16,851
And if that would fall under the budget, that's already been created for KP law.

1562
02:04:17,691 --> 02:04:19,913
I can discuss that with KP law and Senator Scanlon.

1563
02:04:19,933 --> 02:04:25,756
I don't know how my other counselors feel about that, if they want to offer an opinion on that.

1564
02:04:26,196 --> 02:04:30,538
Well, I think it, and I appreciate the conundrum we're in, but like,

1565
02:04:30,920 --> 02:04:37,485
Like we said earlier, when we did ask KPLR a question, they specifically said they worked for the administration.

1566
02:04:37,946 --> 02:04:38,947
So we truly did.

1567
02:04:39,367 --> 02:04:58,983
And I think from that moment on, that's when we felt that we had no one else, especially when Kim, there was a question, like we said, during the cap question, when the city solicitor and I believe the finance director said that this isn't, they didn't think you could do that,

1568
02:04:59,614 --> 02:05:03,536
And the chief of staff said, well, he thinks they're wrong.

1569
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:05,498
So we were left in limbo.

1570
02:05:06,078 --> 02:05:14,723
And again, this brings up another question that we have in tonight's budget with the cap issue that's still left out there.

1571
02:05:14,743 --> 02:05:15,904
So that still needs to be answered.

1572
02:05:15,944 --> 02:05:27,351
So what we're seeing is an unbalanced process that's really

1573
02:05:29,575 --> 02:05:30,896
hurting the whole process, I think.

1574
02:05:30,956 --> 02:05:41,540
So I like, if that's possible, where we have legal representation from KP Law that that's spelled out, that we have a representative that we can reach.

1575
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:43,601
And, you know, it's something simple.

1576
02:05:44,182 --> 02:05:46,783
You know, I try to reach Kim and she's very busy.

1577
02:05:46,803 --> 02:05:58,688
I don't have anybody else to ask because when we first had the question of, oh, we want to go to executive session, it was easy for us to call Howard and the school committee.

1578
02:05:59,123 --> 02:06:00,264
and say, Howard, I won't bring this up.

1579
02:06:00,324 --> 02:06:02,125
How does the process work?

1580
02:06:02,765 --> 02:06:10,829
And I didn't have that luxury a few months ago when we had that same issue.

1581
02:06:10,869 --> 02:06:18,633
So it's something that simple because ultimately it makes us sort of look incompetent to our constituents.

1582
02:06:18,673 --> 02:06:20,494
And I think that that's the biggest concern.

1583
02:06:20,514 --> 02:06:27,198
I think we need to have that partnership that I don't feel we have right now, which is tough.

1584
02:06:28,097 --> 02:06:28,377
Thank you.

1585
02:06:28,557 --> 02:06:30,877
Let me work on that because I didn't see the meeting.

1586
02:06:32,058 --> 02:06:36,038
I watched some, but I didn't see that meeting when John Silverstein said he represented the city.

1587
02:06:36,518 --> 02:06:40,699
And I'm just the possibility that he's the zoning attorney.

1588
02:06:41,039 --> 02:06:46,600
So he's representing the city as it relates to defending, say, the 40 Bs and any zoning issues we have.

1589
02:06:47,620 --> 02:06:50,201
Otherwise, I know Janelle's been before you.

1590
02:06:52,001 --> 02:06:55,022
Attorney Robin is working on the 5G.

1591
02:06:55,142 --> 02:06:57,082
So they all have their niches, and I think they'd

1592
02:06:57,564 --> 02:07:01,066
be willing to come to a council meeting, especially if you don't advance.

1593
02:07:01,567 --> 02:07:02,767
Oh, we need a zoning attorney.

1594
02:07:02,807 --> 02:07:05,029
We need a workman's comp attorney.

1595
02:07:05,569 --> 02:07:06,470
They would be willing to come.

1596
02:07:06,490 --> 02:07:09,452
And I think Kim, I think attorney Scanlon would agree to that.

1597
02:07:09,772 --> 02:07:10,292
No problem.

1598
02:07:10,692 --> 02:07:11,513
So I'll talk to her.

1599
02:07:11,573 --> 02:07:12,013
Absolutely.

1600
02:07:12,033 --> 02:07:12,494
Okay.

1601
02:07:13,274 --> 02:07:13,794
Council member.

1602
02:07:14,735 --> 02:07:15,435
Thank you, Mr. President.

1603
02:07:15,455 --> 02:07:15,555
Yeah.

1604
02:07:15,595 --> 02:07:17,397
I would thank you, madam mayor for being here.

1605
02:07:17,457 --> 02:07:18,157
I would, I'd agree.

1606
02:07:18,217 --> 02:07:18,878
I have like that idea.

1607
02:07:18,918 --> 02:07:24,121
And I think as councilor Scarpelli is pointing out, it's part of it is just, we're not getting our needs met.

1608
02:07:24,161 --> 02:07:27,303
You know, sometimes it's just a quick question about what is the proper way to do this.

1609
02:07:27,921 --> 02:07:34,243
And to your point about the different attorneys and KPO offer different areas, I'm not sure that's ever even been presented to us.

1610
02:07:34,283 --> 02:07:38,163
It's like, we'd go to a meeting and we'd see a new one there and be like, who are we getting tonight?

1611
02:07:38,223 --> 02:07:52,267
So I think just understanding that would go a long way, but I really appreciate the idea of just, you know, someone dedicated to the council that can help us with, you know, just being above board, doing everything properly, because we hit on these new challenges all the time.

1612
02:07:52,347 --> 02:07:53,227
And I think to the point of,

1613
02:07:53,755 --> 02:07:56,236
KP Law's experience, they have experience in these other communities.

1614
02:07:56,276 --> 02:08:01,599
A lot of times the question is, you know, asking Attorney Scanlon, what have other communities drafted?

1615
02:08:01,619 --> 02:08:02,839
What are they doing in this area?

1616
02:08:02,859 --> 02:08:07,121
So it seems like something that they could assist with, but we're not getting that assistance right now.

1617
02:08:07,661 --> 02:08:09,142
Yeah, we can definitely work on that.

1618
02:08:09,162 --> 02:08:13,684
I'm glad I came tonight to hear from you directly.

1619
02:08:13,744 --> 02:08:21,688
I think, yeah, there's at least 45 attorneys in that firm and like from Alicia, Director Hunt to Chief Buckley,

1620
02:08:22,074 --> 02:08:28,256
they each talk to their, depending on what their niches are, they taught and they are getting a lot of work done within these individual offices.

1621
02:08:28,356 --> 02:08:36,019
Tim McGivern is another department head that definitely works with a totally separate attorney than Chief Buckley would or Alicia Hunt would.

1622
02:08:36,079 --> 02:08:39,361
So yeah, they've been, they've been great.

1623
02:08:39,401 --> 02:08:45,003
And definitely, I think Solicitor Scanlon would agree to work on that.

1624
02:08:48,104 --> 02:08:48,824
Thank you, Mr. President.

1625
02:08:48,864 --> 02:08:51,065
I was just going to say, I want to second what Councilor

1626
02:08:51,602 --> 02:08:57,366
Council President Garabella said that having a direct line from us to KP Law, I think is the important thing here.

1627
02:08:58,086 --> 02:09:00,828
I understand what you're saying about having a consistent contact point.

1628
02:09:01,188 --> 02:09:07,593
And if that person could then refer us to the bank of different specialties, I think that process I think is really valuable to us.

1629
02:09:09,614 --> 02:09:14,137
And again, my hope would be in the long run that we would transition back to a more in-house model.

1630
02:09:14,477 --> 02:09:19,381
If this is an acceptable transitional arrangement, I think that could be good.

1631
02:09:19,701 --> 02:09:20,001
Thank you.

1632
02:09:22,061 --> 02:09:27,902
I think the question was answered, but your original question, I thought you were looking for one attorney.

1633
02:09:27,942 --> 02:09:32,083
Well, one go-to person, and then that person could say, hey, call.

1634
02:09:32,683 --> 02:09:34,084
I'll refer you over to them.

1635
02:09:34,424 --> 02:09:42,045
But rather than just calling in a general person at a time, say, you know, attorney Smith is your contact, and you tell them your problem.

1636
02:09:42,105 --> 02:09:46,306
If they can't help you, they'll refer you to whatever person.

1637
02:09:46,366 --> 02:09:48,827
It's the same as you going to your GP doctor.

1638
02:09:49,447 --> 02:09:50,927
You know, they treat you for small stuff.

1639
02:09:51,573 --> 02:09:57,057
And they refer you out to whoever does whatever specialty you need.

1640
02:09:57,518 --> 02:10:05,423
And that's what happens now, out of respect for Solicitor Scanlon, a department head will say, I need somebody for protection of wetlands.

1641
02:10:06,344 --> 02:10:12,328
Attorney Scanlon will talk to somebody at KP Law and get the proper referral for whatever department head needs that attorney.

1642
02:10:12,408 --> 02:10:17,112
So we can try to work out sort of the same scenario with the council.

1643
02:10:17,921 --> 02:10:27,069
out of respect for solicitor Scanlon, she'll know everything that comes into the office and she's managing everything that's going on city council wise mayor's office and every other department within the city.

1644
02:10:28,009 --> 02:10:34,655
But I'll throw up both ideas and we'll see what we can come up with.

1645
02:10:35,556 --> 02:10:40,900
So if a council comes up with a request, who's the gatekeeper of the request?

1646
02:10:42,910 --> 02:10:47,572
So the way the process goes now is the city clerk sends it up to my office.

1647
02:10:47,672 --> 02:10:51,413
I sign off and it referred to attorney Scanlon and then attorney Scanlon.

1648
02:10:52,033 --> 02:10:57,055
But if we have this new process now where we have KP law, just say they assigned Joe Smith to it.

1649
02:10:57,595 --> 02:11:00,316
And tomorrow the council says we want Joe Smith to look into this.

1650
02:11:00,837 --> 02:11:02,457
Does it require your approval?

1651
02:11:05,498 --> 02:11:09,280
I mean, I refer anything legal to the solicitors offers.

1652
02:11:09,300 --> 02:11:10,160
I don't think there's anything.

1653
02:11:10,783 --> 02:11:11,664
held up, so.

1654
02:11:12,064 --> 02:11:15,026
That kind of defeats the whole purpose of what you're talking about.

1655
02:11:15,046 --> 02:11:19,469
I thought that we would have a direct contact rather than going through you.

1656
02:11:19,489 --> 02:11:24,171
Like I say, like Councilman Mark says, tomorrow morning we get a question, we call up Attorney Smith.

1657
02:11:24,472 --> 02:11:29,895
You just contact Attorney Scanlon and say we have a resolution on the agenda for such and such an issue.

1658
02:11:30,175 --> 02:11:34,858
Yeah, I will try to get it direct, but if it's a resolution, it comes to my office for sign off.

1659
02:11:35,358 --> 02:11:36,139
If it's a resolution.

1660
02:11:36,459 --> 02:11:39,301
But if you want to contact Attorney Scanlon like you would call her anyway,

1661
02:11:39,913 --> 02:11:46,298
and ask for a certain attorney at your meeting for July 19th, then we'll try to get you that attorney.

1662
02:11:46,498 --> 02:11:46,718
Right.

1663
02:11:47,379 --> 02:11:49,600
That wasn't what I was thinking.

1664
02:11:49,680 --> 02:11:49,881
Right.

1665
02:11:50,141 --> 02:11:56,646
I just want to make sure that we don't get into the circumstance where requests by this council are being denied.

1666
02:11:57,406 --> 02:11:58,968
Because that defeats the whole purpose.

1667
02:11:59,028 --> 02:12:00,569
I want you to get your ordinances written.

1668
02:12:00,669 --> 02:12:04,772
I've seen Attorney Scanlon send a number to my office that she's trying to work on.

1669
02:12:04,792 --> 02:12:05,833
But you see our point.

1670
02:12:06,293 --> 02:12:08,475
We don't want to be contingent upon

1671
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:10,701
Will the mayor approve it or not?

1672
02:12:10,881 --> 02:12:14,062
You know, I don't think we should operate as a body that way, right?

1673
02:12:14,783 --> 02:12:16,323
So that's it.

1674
02:12:16,383 --> 02:12:18,184
And I thought that's what the president was offering.

1675
02:12:18,224 --> 02:12:23,186
Sometimes a question can be answered with a phone call rather than make a free phone call to get the same thing.

1676
02:12:23,527 --> 02:12:26,508
Like I said, I think I said, we'll talk it through.

1677
02:12:26,548 --> 02:12:28,189
I'll talk it through with Solicitor Scanlon.

1678
02:12:28,209 --> 02:12:31,190
If you want to put the recommendation on the floor, I will try to work on it.

1679
02:12:33,541 --> 02:12:35,562
There's a motion on the floor, Mr. President.

1680
02:12:35,582 --> 02:12:41,904
Why don't we vote on the motion, and then if this passes, the mayor can come back with a plan, and then we can ask for supplemental spending to appropriate the funds.

1681
02:12:41,925 --> 02:12:46,086
I mean, there's no guarantees that we're going to get anything once we pass this budget.

1682
02:12:46,146 --> 02:12:49,468
Once we vote on this budget, vote on this money, you know, it's going to go back to the coroner's office.

1683
02:12:49,828 --> 02:12:51,609
Then either it's going to happen or it's not.

1684
02:12:51,669 --> 02:12:52,689
If it doesn't, what's our leverage?

1685
02:12:53,849 --> 02:12:54,750
So you want to vote on it?

1686
02:12:54,830 --> 02:13:02,453
I'm saying if we say, OK, we'll reduce the budget by this much, come back to us with the plan, ask us for the money to be reappropriated again in a supplemental spending packet,

1687
02:13:03,192 --> 02:13:12,755
we'll be happy to consider it provided that the council's brothers are met in terms of having a one point person point of contact that we can pick up and call and ask for legal advice that's gonna respond to us.

1688
02:13:15,556 --> 02:13:16,557
That would be my recommendation.

1689
02:13:19,458 --> 02:13:20,198
You're making that motion?

1690
02:13:20,218 --> 02:13:22,519
I made the motion to reduce.

1691
02:13:22,539 --> 02:13:24,059
I already made the motion to reduce.

1692
02:13:25,079 --> 02:13:25,540
Council Meeks.

1693
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:29,341
I just wanna make sure if it's not often we do supplemental.

1694
02:13:29,421 --> 02:13:32,562
So maybe Felicia can advise us on that.

1695
02:13:33,182 --> 02:13:33,542
Alicia.

1696
02:13:38,065 --> 02:13:39,085
Good evening, councilors.

1697
02:13:39,126 --> 02:13:41,407
So you're asking if you can do add to the budget?

1698
02:13:43,088 --> 02:13:45,970
Are you adding or are you asking about a 112 budget?

1699
02:13:46,250 --> 02:13:48,131
Are you specifically?

1700
02:13:48,231 --> 02:13:50,992
Vice President Knight mentioned, I don't think we want to add, we want to subtract.

1701
02:13:51,012 --> 02:13:55,535
What I'm saying is we have $81,000 in the contracted legal services line item.

1702
02:13:55,595 --> 02:13:58,717
I know that, you know, 20,000 of that's dedicated to labor services.

1703
02:13:58,757 --> 02:14:01,078
So I didn't be happy with the 60, moving the 60,000 out.

1704
02:14:02,583 --> 02:14:12,028
and reducing the budget by $60,000 out of the contracted legal services line item until such time as we can negotiate what satisfies us for legal representation here as a council.

1705
02:14:12,508 --> 02:14:20,672
And once we negotiate that, then you can come back to us for the additional $60,000 in the supplemental spending packet like you did earlier this fiscal year when you asked us to amend the budget.

1706
02:14:21,292 --> 02:14:26,975
You could again come to us and ask us to amend the budget after we negotiate what's gonna work for us with KP Law and legal counsel.

1707
02:14:27,475 --> 02:14:30,777
We could reduce the budget now by the 60,000, which is the amount of the KP Law contract

1708
02:14:31,659 --> 02:14:36,102
We could sit down and we could come up with an agreement that would, you know, satisfy the brothers of this council.

1709
02:14:36,523 --> 02:14:43,167
And then once we reach that agreement, the administration can present to us a supplemental spending paper that asks us to increase the budget by that money.

1710
02:14:43,948 --> 02:14:46,089
But at that point, we'll be able to get our legal counsel.

1711
02:14:48,031 --> 02:14:54,415
You could cut, you could cut the 60,000, but it would be up to the mayor to provide you with a supplemental if she so chooses.

1712
02:15:00,081 --> 02:15:01,221
So that would be the request.

1713
02:15:01,301 --> 02:15:02,582
Reduce the budget right now by the $60,000.

1714
02:15:04,462 --> 02:15:07,463
Negotiate the idea with KP Law.

1715
02:15:07,643 --> 02:15:13,064
We're going to reduce it by 60,000 until we have the opportunity to have a legal counsel that's going to meet our needs.

1716
02:15:13,084 --> 02:15:15,305
It's been a priority for this council for how many years now.

1717
02:15:16,965 --> 02:15:19,606
I think the mayor is making a commitment now that she's willing to work on that.

1718
02:15:19,666 --> 02:15:24,207
So why don't we let her get to work on that and then we can appropriate the funds once we have an agreement.

1719
02:15:24,647 --> 02:15:29,008
Let me get to work on that without cutting the budget and us having to do a supplemental

1720
02:15:29,676 --> 02:15:33,497
$60,000.

1721
02:15:29,736 --> 02:15:33,497
I mean, you could print rebel stamps for us too.

1722
02:15:33,517 --> 02:15:34,838
But at the end of the day, you know what I mean?

1723
02:15:35,398 --> 02:15:38,639
There's some needs and desires.

1724
02:15:39,559 --> 02:15:48,682
So again, the question is going to be as we go forward, the jeopardy of voting positively and negatively for the for the budget.

1725
02:15:50,043 --> 02:15:52,423
Different councils will look at different concerns.

1726
02:15:52,623 --> 02:15:54,764
I look at this one as if

1727
02:15:57,915 --> 02:16:00,896
there is a process for the supplemental budget to look into this.

1728
02:16:01,716 --> 02:16:08,597
And without denying the budget, that's one of the avenues you're looking for Councilor Knight is that.

1729
02:16:10,397 --> 02:16:23,700
So by asking for a reduction and then getting guidance from the finance director of a supplemental budget, doesn't in actuality jeopardize no vote or negative vote.

1730
02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:24,580
So that's-

1731
02:16:26,382 --> 02:16:28,183
vote to reduce the budget and pass the budget this evening.

1732
02:16:28,263 --> 02:16:34,107
But certainly the mayor could come back to us with a supplemental spending packet that addresses some of the concerns that we have, for example, the caps.

1733
02:16:37,429 --> 02:16:39,270
Mr. President.

1734
02:16:39,330 --> 02:16:41,352
Mr. President.

1735
02:16:41,452 --> 02:16:41,972
Mr. Councilman.

1736
02:16:42,412 --> 02:16:44,013
Excuse me, is the reduction $81,600 or $60,000?

1737
02:16:44,053 --> 02:16:51,958
The initial recommendation was to reduce it by the total line item, but I do understand that the line item represents two different types of contracted legal services.

1738
02:16:52,058 --> 02:16:54,340
One's KPLR in the amount of $60,000 and the other one is

1739
02:16:55,041 --> 02:16:57,423
labor council service, the remaining I believe was labor council service.

1740
02:16:58,103 --> 02:17:02,566
So I'd even be satisfied offering the motion to reduce it by 60,000 at this point in time.

1741
02:17:03,066 --> 02:17:04,887
And now the administration may stand right here.

1742
02:17:04,947 --> 02:17:06,668
I mean, it's not like this is a secret, right?

1743
02:17:06,708 --> 02:17:08,529
We've been talking about it for eons now.

1744
02:17:08,549 --> 02:17:12,431
You know, today's January 29th and maybe we're going to get somewhere.

1745
02:17:13,072 --> 02:17:18,515
But at the end of the day, if we reduce this line item by 60,000, put it back on the administration to come back to us and give us what we're looking for.

1746
02:17:20,116 --> 02:17:21,937
So, I mean, I think it's a sticking point for all of us.

1747
02:17:24,717 --> 02:17:25,878
What's the best?

1748
02:17:25,898 --> 02:17:26,839
Thank you, Mr. President.

1749
02:17:27,699 --> 02:17:35,665
I guess my question to you, Madam Mayor, would just be what, you know, if that, if those funds were cut, what would the disruption and legal services look like to the city?

1750
02:17:37,086 --> 02:17:50,756
Our new fiscal year starts in two days and we need to continue with legal, legal work that both solicitor and KPLR doing throughout the whole, you know, every department in our community.

1751
02:17:50,816 --> 02:17:52,357
So, um,

1752
02:17:52,905 --> 02:17:58,489
I've never once stopped anybody from KP Law coming before you if Kim's requested them to be here.

1753
02:17:58,549 --> 02:18:01,871
Sometimes I didn't even know specifically.

1754
02:18:01,971 --> 02:18:08,695
So I'm more than happy to give you the legal counsel you need depending on the issue through Kim.

1755
02:18:08,795 --> 02:18:10,697
It can be separate through Kim.

1756
02:18:11,017 --> 02:18:12,238
It's a resolution that comes to me.

1757
02:18:13,819 --> 02:18:16,060
So I will talk to Kim about that tomorrow.

1758
02:18:17,721 --> 02:18:18,422
Solicitor Scanlon.

1759
02:18:18,862 --> 02:18:21,584
So it would be impactful on all

1760
02:18:22,034 --> 02:18:23,174
departments is what you're saying.

1761
02:18:24,175 --> 02:18:29,896
Yes, I wouldn't have the funds to pay the monthly rate of 5000 a month.

1762
02:18:30,496 --> 02:18:48,040
And then we have it was 3200 100 for Labor Council plus whatever Copeland and page and solicitor Scanlon have working in every other department because there's other line items that so point of information where patient got scrapped.

1763
02:18:48,060 --> 02:18:51,041
I think we only reduce it by 50 keeping 10

1764
02:18:51,785 --> 02:18:55,466
giving the mayor some time to see what we can do.

1765
02:18:56,466 --> 02:18:57,687
Our next meeting's on July 20th.

1766
02:18:57,727 --> 02:19:00,028
It's 20 days away.

1767
02:19:00,168 --> 02:19:01,848
We can work this out in two weeks and it'll be over with.

1768
02:19:01,908 --> 02:19:05,709
I don't think there's gonna be much of a disruption.

1769
02:19:07,730 --> 02:19:12,451
It's my intention to vote in favor of the supplemental funding provided that the council gets what they're asking for.

1770
02:19:12,491 --> 02:19:15,852
I think it's everybody's intention to do that if that's the direction we wanna go in.

1771
02:19:16,313 --> 02:19:16,973
It's not like we're gonna

1772
02:19:18,070 --> 02:19:21,812
hold this up, but ultimately we've been asking for something up, uh, better part of 24 months.

1773
02:19:22,173 --> 02:19:23,734
And today's the last day of the fiscal year.

1774
02:19:23,754 --> 02:19:26,816
And now we're finally getting somewhere, you know, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

1775
02:19:28,877 --> 02:19:33,060
So councilor vice president has a motion on the floor of the amended motion.

1776
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:39,324
Mr. President, the amended motion would be to reduce the contracted legal services line item 0 1 0 1 5 1 5 3 0 2 in the amount of $60,000.

1777
02:19:44,547 --> 02:19:46,349
then the administration knows what our intent is.

1778
02:19:46,369 --> 02:19:52,498
They can come back to us with a supplemental spending packet if they're able to work out an agreement between this council.

1779
02:19:52,758 --> 02:19:58,045
And I'd be happy to let the council president serve as the negotiator for this body to come up with that agreement.

1780
02:19:58,781 --> 02:20:02,282
Mr. President, so that would be my recommendation on the money, though.

1781
02:20:02,582 --> 02:20:02,762
$60,000 from 0101515302.

1782
02:20:02,802 --> 02:20:03,343
Okay.

1783
02:20:03,363 --> 02:20:07,884
Councilors, a motion to the floor.

1784
02:20:08,644 --> 02:20:09,405
Seconded by.

1785
02:20:09,705 --> 02:20:09,945
Second.

1786
02:20:10,385 --> 02:20:11,525
Seconded by Councilor Thompson.

1787
02:20:11,685 --> 02:20:12,246
Mr. President.

1788
02:20:12,626 --> 02:20:13,146
Councilor Best.

1789
02:20:13,406 --> 02:20:14,266
All right.

1790
02:20:14,426 --> 02:20:15,787
Can we amend that to a $50,000 cut?

1791
02:20:16,907 --> 02:20:20,288
It was Councilor Naito's amendments motion.

1792
02:20:21,789 --> 02:20:23,729
Councilor Naito is amenable to that.

1793
02:20:27,591 --> 02:20:28,211
For the purpose of?

1794
02:20:28,752 --> 02:20:30,753
allowing the 20 days of contingency spending?

1795
02:20:31,513 --> 02:20:36,555
I think even allowing, given the shortened schedule over the summer months, both July and August, if necessary.

1796
02:20:37,235 --> 02:20:45,358
I'd certainly be willing to reduce the figure to allow them to continue through July in the amount of, what's it, $5,000 retainer per month.

1797
02:20:45,418 --> 02:20:50,620
I'd be happy to be amenable to that, to let them get through the month of July with their retainer.

1798
02:20:50,900 --> 02:20:51,040
So $55,000.

1799
02:20:51,081 --> 02:20:55,122
So it'd be reduced by $55,000, leave $5,000, and they'd have to pay the bills for July.

1800
02:20:55,142 --> 02:20:55,902
So they'd have to change that to $55,000.

1801
02:20:58,644 --> 02:21:03,088
On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Belco.

1802
02:21:03,508 --> 02:21:04,589
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1803
02:21:06,711 --> 02:21:07,772
This is to reduce the amount of 55,000?

1804
02:21:08,052 --> 02:21:11,816
Yes, from the line item that Councilor, Vice President has given.

1805
02:21:13,617 --> 02:21:14,158
Councilor Behrs.

1806
02:21:14,178 --> 02:21:18,161
I'm gonna have to go now.

1807
02:21:19,442 --> 02:21:19,742
I'm sorry?

1808
02:21:21,084 --> 02:21:25,187
No, I wanted to, but I don't disagree in principle, but my vote's no.

1809
02:21:28,834 --> 02:21:29,074
Yes.

1810
02:21:32,516 --> 02:21:32,856
Yes.

1811
02:21:35,977 --> 02:21:36,538
Councilor Marks?

1812
02:21:36,718 --> 02:21:37,078
Yes.

1813
02:21:39,119 --> 02:21:39,699
Councilor Morrell?

1814
02:21:39,979 --> 02:21:40,179
No.

1815
02:21:43,181 --> 02:21:43,921
Councilor Scarpelli?

1816
02:21:44,161 --> 02:21:44,441
Yes.

1817
02:21:46,462 --> 02:21:47,183
President Kerrio?

1818
02:21:47,503 --> 02:21:48,763
Yes.

1819
02:21:49,544 --> 02:21:54,066
Five in affirmative, two in opposition, motion passes.

1820
02:21:55,967 --> 02:21:56,567
Moving forward.

1821
02:22:00,667 --> 02:22:03,669
Mr. President, I had a couple questions.

1822
02:22:03,689 --> 02:22:05,050
I don't know exactly how you want to do this.

1823
02:22:05,090 --> 02:22:11,014
I had questions on elections, uh, P. D. S. And then a few D. P. W. Departments.

1824
02:22:11,895 --> 02:22:14,597
Um, my question on elections.

1825
02:22:14,637 --> 02:22:28,607
Just to clarify the communication we received from the administration is that from what I could tell, $31,500 was added to the budget and moved to the personnel line or salaries line for the elections.

1826
02:22:29,207 --> 02:22:30,248
Uh, register our voters

1827
02:22:30,842 --> 02:22:32,983
to create a full-time election coordinator, is that correct?

1828
02:22:33,064 --> 02:22:33,504
That's correct.

1829
02:22:33,884 --> 02:22:36,706
And that would be cap 11 and posted publicly for hiring?

1830
02:22:37,366 --> 02:22:37,647
Correct.

1831
02:22:38,027 --> 02:22:41,309
And would that happen prior to the municipal election?

1832
02:22:43,030 --> 02:22:43,230
Yes.

1833
02:22:43,651 --> 02:22:43,931
Okay.

1834
02:22:45,772 --> 02:22:52,817
And you're working with the clerk on the hiring process or I don't know if the clerk wants to, how would that hiring process work?

1835
02:22:52,837 --> 02:22:54,298
The clerk is the final decision or?

1836
02:22:54,978 --> 02:22:55,919
Would that job be posted?

1837
02:22:56,139 --> 02:22:57,660
That job will be posted in fall.

1838
02:22:58,450 --> 02:22:59,430
regular procedure.

1839
02:22:59,470 --> 02:23:00,991
So that will go through human resources.

1840
02:23:01,451 --> 02:23:01,751
Okay.

1841
02:23:02,112 --> 02:23:03,932
Um, I guess I'm just wondering on the timing here.

1842
02:23:04,372 --> 02:23:10,675
You know, we are coming up pretty quickly on a municipal preliminary election September 14th.

1843
02:23:10,835 --> 02:23:18,038
So, you know, would this person be on board in a timely fashion to ensure that our elections go forward smoothly?

1844
02:23:18,798 --> 02:23:24,300
We have a number of positions we would like to advertise in July, including this one.

1845
02:23:25,161 --> 02:23:25,361
All right.

1846
02:23:25,441 --> 02:23:25,721
Thank you.

1847
02:23:25,741 --> 02:23:26,561
That's my main concern.

1848
02:23:26,581 --> 02:23:27,302
It's just timing.

1849
02:23:27,582 --> 02:23:27,982
Vice President

1850
02:23:28,581 --> 02:23:33,464
Um, does the election coordinator position have a cap that's been established by the city council?

1851
02:23:38,546 --> 02:23:39,246
I don't know.

1852
02:23:39,266 --> 02:23:41,908
We're gonna have to review all the cast.

1853
02:23:41,948 --> 02:23:54,874
This is a historic problem that's far far precedes me and a number of positions are not in the calf, such as, um, even Mr Gordon's position that I and I didn't obviously hire him.

1854
02:23:54,894 --> 02:23:56,215
So there's many that we have to

1855
02:23:56,679 --> 02:24:04,743
skim through and propose and try to fix up, clean up and present to you over your July and August meeting, including this position.

1856
02:24:05,283 --> 02:24:07,084
This is a new position, there would not be a CAF.

1857
02:24:07,545 --> 02:24:09,325
Okay, so this is a new position, there is no CAF.

1858
02:24:10,246 --> 02:24:12,687
You are aware of the opinions the solicitor wrote?

1859
02:24:16,089 --> 02:24:16,309
Yes.

1860
02:24:16,569 --> 02:24:17,430
Okay.

1861
02:24:17,910 --> 02:24:25,794
The chief of staff has come before this body and has explained to this council that it's his legal opinion that if the council passes the budget that contains a position

1862
02:24:26,865 --> 02:24:29,146
that that automatically amends the CAF ordinance.

1863
02:24:29,726 --> 02:24:40,511
I don't find that to be the fact because the budget that's before us is a spending paper and the budget that's before us requires us to go through a certain process and an ordinance requires us to go through a much different process.

1864
02:24:41,551 --> 02:24:48,794
So with that being said, you're asking us to support a paper this evening that doesn't have a classification that's been established or approved by this council, is that correct?

1865
02:24:51,475 --> 02:24:55,217
There's an amount that we've chosen which fits a CAF

1866
02:24:56,157 --> 02:24:57,118
but it's a new position.

1867
02:24:57,878 --> 02:25:06,684
So we're asking you to approve the budget and we will do whatever we have to do to make sure the CAFs are approved before.

1868
02:25:11,547 --> 02:25:15,650
Through the chair, I know that Councilor Marks had asked for the 64,000.

1869
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:19,372
So the mayor did give, or six, I think it was around that amount, or 62,000.

1870
02:25:19,652 --> 02:25:25,096
So the mayor did pick CAF 11 to get it close to what Councilor Marks had asked for.

1871
02:25:26,363 --> 02:25:28,763
for that full-time election coordinator position?

1872
02:25:29,544 --> 02:25:32,564
It was just a doubling of the part-time cell, right?

1873
02:25:32,624 --> 02:25:35,325
I think it was 32,000 and we just asked to double it.

1874
02:25:36,025 --> 02:25:37,085
I understand that.

1875
02:25:37,145 --> 02:25:38,365
Thank you.

1876
02:25:38,705 --> 02:25:52,808
What my concern is is that, you know, if it's the opinion from the administration that we don't have to create a cap, they can create positions and classifications, just put people in them and bypassing the budget, that's a constructive acceptance of the ordinance change.

1877
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:56,382
that creates a whole different ball of wax for this document that's in front of me here this evening.

1878
02:25:57,643 --> 02:25:58,484
A whole different ball of wax.

1879
02:25:59,184 --> 02:26:00,566
We have a position that came before us.

1880
02:26:01,546 --> 02:26:02,407
The cap was voted down.

1881
02:26:04,048 --> 02:26:06,430
Individual still continues to be compensated in that cap.

1882
02:26:07,711 --> 02:26:08,892
So I think it's problematic.

1883
02:26:09,112 --> 02:26:10,293
You know what I mean?

1884
02:26:10,333 --> 02:26:11,374
I really think it's problematic.

1885
02:26:11,514 --> 02:26:20,061
I think that any position that's included in this document right here that doesn't have a cap should be eliminated from the budget.

1886
02:26:21,982 --> 02:26:23,003
The administration can come back

1887
02:26:23,390 --> 02:26:29,375
just like we talked about with the KP law item, with the supplemental spending package, that does it the right way.

1888
02:26:29,955 --> 02:26:31,817
Take all the personalities out of this, right?

1889
02:26:32,197 --> 02:26:33,538
Take all the personalities out of this.

1890
02:26:34,278 --> 02:26:35,840
Let's talk about process, all right?

1891
02:26:36,180 --> 02:26:39,202
We have an opinion from the city solicitor saying, this is how you're supposed to do it.

1892
02:26:39,763 --> 02:26:42,425
We have an opinion from the chief of staff saying, no, we should do it this way.

1893
02:26:42,445 --> 02:26:45,207
There's no opinion from the chief of staff, he's not legal counsel.

1894
02:26:46,028 --> 02:26:48,469
That's very, very encouraging to hear.

1895
02:26:49,030 --> 02:26:52,753
So at the end of the day, Mr. President, you know, I think that we're putting the,

1896
02:26:53,337 --> 02:27:07,287
before the horse a lot of times here, and it might be better off for us as a body, in a cleaner, more transparent fashion, for us to have the classifications voted upon, and then the spending associated with those classifications come with us after the fact.

1897
02:27:09,128 --> 02:27:12,470
And this is something I feel very strongly about, Mr. President.

1898
02:27:12,490 --> 02:27:22,057
We've always been talking about CAFs and classifications, and doing things the right way, making sure that employees that do jobs that are created and posted have to exist.

1899
02:27:22,618 --> 02:27:27,161
These jobs have to exist, and they don't exist if we don't update the CAF ordinance to reflect this.

1900
02:27:27,341 --> 02:27:34,065
So while there may be historical problems with the CAF ordinance, that doesn't mean that the process shouldn't be rectified now for the new jobs that are being created.

1901
02:27:34,725 --> 02:27:36,326
And that's where I stand on this issue, Mr. President.

1902
02:27:37,027 --> 02:27:38,468
I support an election-coordinated position.

1903
02:27:38,488 --> 02:27:39,348
I absolutely do.

1904
02:27:39,508 --> 02:27:41,169
I want to approve the CAF before I approve the money.

1905
02:27:41,930 --> 02:27:44,391
I want to create the job before I fund the job that doesn't exist.

1906
02:27:45,272 --> 02:27:50,655
That's where I am on this issue with all the CAFs, all the classifications in this budget that don't exist by way of ordinance, Mr. President.

1907
02:27:51,255 --> 02:27:51,976
We're funding money.

1908
02:27:52,656 --> 02:27:54,037
to a position that doesn't exist.

1909
02:27:55,577 --> 02:28:10,043
So ultimately what we're doing- You asked for us to create and we responded that in July and August, we will get you, we're gonna try to clean all this up from many years of not having been done right.

1910
02:28:10,063 --> 02:28:12,064
I do believe I have the floor, Mr. President.

1911
02:28:12,664 --> 02:28:16,526
And I do believe that if it hasn't been done right in the past, why are we gonna perpetuate that?

1912
02:28:17,606 --> 02:28:19,947
Ultimately, we have a number of positions that need to be created.

1913
02:28:19,967 --> 02:28:21,928
So let's go through the process and create

1914
02:28:22,629 --> 02:28:25,892
All right, let's go through the process and create them properly, and then fund those positions.

1915
02:28:26,332 --> 02:28:29,475
Let's not throw money and fund them for jobs that don't exist, and then wait.

1916
02:28:30,015 --> 02:28:32,437
Because we did that once before, and it didn't work out so well for us.

1917
02:28:33,118 --> 02:28:38,062
It didn't work out so well for us to attune to $700 a week, all right, to an individual employee.

1918
02:28:38,363 --> 02:28:45,068
So, you know, I'm looking at this, and I'm saying that there's a couple of situations and concerns that raises the concern to me with financial transparency.

1919
02:28:45,429 --> 02:28:46,950
Number one, financial transparency.

1920
02:28:49,170 --> 02:28:54,193
The positions haven't, there's been no ask to create the positions, nevermind funding, but there's a request to fund.

1921
02:28:54,353 --> 02:28:55,934
Why don't we create the positions first, then fund?

1922
02:28:56,394 --> 02:28:57,935
All right, let's put the horse before the cart.

1923
02:28:59,516 --> 02:29:07,040
Because there might be disputing about the caps and classifications that employees are being placed in, in these new positions.

1924
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:10,722
So I really think it needs to be looked at, and it needs to be looked at a little bit stronger and harder.

1925
02:29:11,703 --> 02:29:15,685
I don't wanna stand in the way of taking a vote on a budget, Mr. President, but what I do wanna do is vote on a budget that makes sense.

1926
02:29:16,055 --> 02:29:19,597
and I wanna vote on a budget that complies with the legal advice that we've received from the city solicitor.

1927
02:29:20,238 --> 02:29:24,260
And I wanna make a vote on a budget that has some financial transparency.

1928
02:29:25,341 --> 02:29:26,602
And I think that's really what we need right now.

1929
02:29:27,283 --> 02:29:34,667
So with the creation of all these, because no one's against moving the city forward, no one's against making progress, but we wanna do it the right way.

1930
02:29:34,687 --> 02:29:44,414
And the right way to do it is to present the CAF to this council first, to change the ordinance, to create a position, just like we did when we created Penny, the Substance Abuse Prevention Office.

1931
02:29:45,269 --> 02:29:45,829
How do we do that?

1932
02:29:45,849 --> 02:29:48,692
I remember how we did it, because I sat here and I took a vote on it.

1933
02:29:49,072 --> 02:29:51,113
What we did was we created the CAF first.

1934
02:29:51,213 --> 02:29:53,915
We created the line item, we created the CAF, we created the classification.

1935
02:29:54,536 --> 02:29:56,017
We sent that to the mayor, it came back to us.

1936
02:29:56,698 --> 02:29:58,319
Then the mayor came back and they funded the position.

1937
02:29:59,299 --> 02:30:00,681
We can't fund positions that don't exist.

1938
02:30:01,061 --> 02:30:02,001
It's financially irresponsible.

1939
02:30:06,545 --> 02:30:07,105
Councilor Baca.

1940
02:30:07,626 --> 02:30:08,847
Thank you, Mr. President.

1941
02:30:08,887 --> 02:30:10,988
Continuing on Councilor Knight's point.

1942
02:30:11,008 --> 02:30:12,910
I mean, there are many positions here.

1943
02:30:12,930 --> 02:30:14,711
We've been asking this for a while.

1944
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:17,893
We've been meeting, I think, on the budget for about a month now.

1945
02:30:18,373 --> 02:30:34,932
If you take a look at a lot of these positions, Director of Parking, Parking Enforcement Officer, Facilities Manager, Recreation Facilities Coordinator, I mean, these here, so there's one, two, three, four, five, so there's at least five different positions that

1946
02:30:37,717 --> 02:30:39,657
were presented in the budget.

1947
02:30:39,777 --> 02:30:49,139
So the caps could have been presented by the administration to this council and passed prior to this point.

1948
02:30:52,100 --> 02:30:53,000
And they weren't.

1949
02:30:54,120 --> 02:30:58,061
So it's like, I understand the elections coordinator is something that just came up.

1950
02:30:58,141 --> 02:30:58,781
I understand that.

1951
02:30:59,321 --> 02:31:03,581
But these here, I mean, these here were part of the budget proposal.

1952
02:31:04,382 --> 02:31:06,962
And the budget, I believe was first presented, I think,

1953
02:31:07,413 --> 02:31:08,133
June 1st, maybe.

1954
02:31:08,774 --> 02:31:22,243
And so these here paperwork could have came before us to prove the cap, or at least get that process started before we were at the point tonight where we're going to be voting on a budget.

1955
02:31:23,503 --> 02:31:27,986
So, and this could have in some ways, some of this could have been avoided.

1956
02:31:28,026 --> 02:31:29,747
That's the point I'm trying to make.

1957
02:31:30,068 --> 02:31:30,448
Thank you.

1958
02:31:30,468 --> 02:31:31,388
Thank you.

1959
02:31:31,428 --> 02:31:33,090
Councilor Mox.

1960
02:31:33,130 --> 02:31:36,972
Mr. President, you know, to me, I understand what my colleagues have stated.

1961
02:31:37,633 --> 02:31:45,496
And naturally, I think, you know, if you're looking at a process, the CAF should be presented to us.

1962
02:31:45,956 --> 02:31:49,818
That means the council either is on board with this new position or not.

1963
02:31:50,438 --> 02:31:56,380
So to me, you would wanna do that before you say, well, will you fund this position?

1964
02:31:56,760 --> 02:31:59,981
And then have the council come back and say, well, we don't agree with this position.

1965
02:32:00,402 --> 02:32:06,764
So I think you would need a fundamental agreement of the position before you ask for the funding.

1966
02:32:07,285 --> 02:32:09,547
So that's just how I feel.

1967
02:32:09,987 --> 02:32:34,548
But the larger question I have for the mayor is that if the mayor agrees that the fact as council president mentioned that the mere fact that this may appear in the budget does not initiate the CAF process, meaning that it doesn't require a vote of the council because the approval is in place of

1968
02:32:35,113 --> 02:32:40,275
the vote of the council for the CAF, then we have a real fundamental difference.

1969
02:32:40,776 --> 02:32:47,519
Because I believe, Mr. President, whether it's in the budget first or not, that it still requires a vote of the council.

1970
02:32:48,279 --> 02:32:53,202
So the creation of that position requires a formal vote of the council.

1971
02:32:54,042 --> 02:33:04,487
And I'd like to know the mayor's position on that, because from what I heard from the chief of staff, and I think this is some of the questions that he had, I don't know what the exact questions were,

1972
02:33:04,948 --> 02:33:28,313
regarding the city solicitor's opinion, but he did state the other day that he sent a few questions to the city solicitor and they haven't been responded to yet regarding her opinion, but I won't put words in the chief of staff's mouth, but I believe he felt that the mere fact that we voted for a position that was in the budget, therefore, it doesn't require for you to come back before us to get approval of the CAF.

1973
02:33:28,973 --> 02:33:29,894
And that's my understanding.

1974
02:33:29,914 --> 02:33:31,734
And if that's the understanding of the administration,

1975
02:33:32,265 --> 02:33:43,333
then at least me and the administration, we're on two completely different sides, Mr. President, because the CAFs are created by ordinance and the ordinance is a responsibility of this council.

1976
02:33:43,373 --> 02:33:52,880
So if the mayor is stating here tonight, which I think the response, and I won't speak to the mayor, the response is stating, you're going to look at these CAF positions and then present it to us.

1977
02:33:53,921 --> 02:33:56,563
You know, some members might have wanted it before the budget, but

1978
02:33:57,427 --> 02:34:16,222
I'm not gonna split hairs at this point, but if you're saying that this requires a vote of the council, otherwise you cannot put someone on, because currently right now we have someone that's working out of their calf and has been paid many, many months out of their calf without approval by the council.

1979
02:34:16,802 --> 02:34:24,468
And the fact that that is still ongoing leads me to believe that that is the position of the administration

1980
02:34:24,935 --> 02:34:26,336
that it doesn't require this cap.

1981
02:34:26,356 --> 02:34:27,936
So do you hear what I'm saying?

1982
02:34:28,757 --> 02:34:43,023
So I'm kind of tossed because in one breath you're saying we're gonna present the cap to the council and the other breath, someone's being paid out of the cap because it was never approved by the council and they continue to be paid.

1983
02:34:43,083 --> 02:34:53,487
So if you're able to at least shed some light, I know I put a lot out there, but I just wanna know fundamentally, if you believe that the caps are required vote of the council,

1984
02:34:54,097 --> 02:35:06,065
And even though the position may be funded in the budget, and there may be money July 1st for you, you cannot put someone on until that cap position exists within the ordinance.

1985
02:35:06,525 --> 02:35:07,646
Do you agree with that?

1986
02:35:08,226 --> 02:35:12,288
Now that there's issues with the cap process, yes.

1987
02:35:12,389 --> 02:35:17,071
And we've cleared up the historic mistakes that have been taking place.

1988
02:35:18,853 --> 02:35:22,575
The budget is something that you hopefully will pass tonight.

1989
02:35:23,039 --> 02:35:24,500
and has new positions in it.

1990
02:35:25,180 --> 02:35:34,246
We understand that, and it's our plan to have those CAFs before you in July, so that we can then go higher.

1991
02:35:34,666 --> 02:35:51,797
But unless you said tonight, I'm voting for this budget, except I don't want parking enforcement to come in-house, I would assume, or example like that, I would assume that these new positions are okay, and that you would hopefully support it in July.

1992
02:35:53,442 --> 02:35:58,446
past the budget last year and we have the human resources and diversity director position in there.

1993
02:35:58,726 --> 02:36:00,567
It was approved at that pay scale.

1994
02:36:01,088 --> 02:36:02,749
That position was always acting.

1995
02:36:03,109 --> 02:36:10,295
When we wanted to take away the acting title, we came before you, we put it before you in January, it was still acting.

1996
02:36:10,855 --> 02:36:13,357
And for some reason, it did take months.

1997
02:36:13,757 --> 02:36:15,759
So that position has, he has

1998
02:36:16,410 --> 02:36:20,454
Mr. Osborne has stayed in that position because he's doing a great, great job.

1999
02:36:21,014 --> 02:36:23,576
I just assumed it would, it was in the budget.

2000
02:36:24,017 --> 02:36:28,140
Nobody said a word about the salary or the placement of the cap.

2001
02:36:29,221 --> 02:36:31,183
He was acting, nobody said anything.

2002
02:36:31,503 --> 02:36:36,667
And then come January, when we want to take the acting title away, I assumed it would be approved.

2003
02:36:36,687 --> 02:36:43,333
And it wasn't, it took, it had months of debate and meetings and eventually was voted down.

2004
02:36:43,806 --> 02:36:45,527
So now we're changing that completely.

2005
02:36:45,547 --> 02:36:47,728
We hear you, we're collaborating.

2006
02:36:48,128 --> 02:36:51,969
It's gonna be chief people officer, which is a new position that will need to be capped.

2007
02:36:52,530 --> 02:36:54,250
He's here, he's working for us now.

2008
02:36:54,330 --> 02:37:02,694
So that's a little different than a parking officer or the head of facilities maintenance, which we will not hire until you approve the cap.

2009
02:37:03,134 --> 02:37:12,638
Hopefully you'll do so in July when we present it, especially if you prove the budget tonight without having a problem with facilities maintenance director,

2010
02:37:13,367 --> 02:37:21,752
a chief people officer, a parking enforcement director, officers, obviously, to enforce that parking.

2011
02:37:22,332 --> 02:37:32,578
If I don't hear those questions and concerns now, I really would hope that we can work together to move those initiatives forward by approving the CAFs when they come before you in July.

2012
02:37:32,598 --> 02:37:42,363
Because I wasn't gonna put it, we were gonna put 10 CAFs before you a couple of weeks ago for you to just not want them in the budget and us find out tonight.

2013
02:37:42,882 --> 02:37:44,443
So it's like, yeah, what do you, what do you do first?

2014
02:37:44,723 --> 02:37:45,384
I don't, I don't know.

2015
02:37:45,824 --> 02:37:47,806
Um, it has to be, but now I hear you.

2016
02:37:48,186 --> 02:37:49,947
We will get the crafts approved.

2017
02:37:50,828 --> 02:37:54,430
Hopefully if the budget passes in July and we will post for those jobs.

2018
02:37:54,450 --> 02:37:56,011
I hope that makes sense.

2019
02:37:56,051 --> 02:38:01,335
Once the budget is passed and the money's appropriated, uh, Alicia, once the money's passed, the budget is appropriated.

2020
02:38:07,666 --> 02:38:13,429
Yeah, once the budget's passed, the money is appropriated, but the mayor's making the pledge that she's gonna bring the CAF before you.

2021
02:38:13,469 --> 02:38:16,231
She's not going to hire until you've passed the CAF.

2022
02:38:16,711 --> 02:38:18,112
What if the CAF's never come before us?

2023
02:38:18,172 --> 02:38:18,993
What happens to that money?

2024
02:38:20,513 --> 02:38:23,175
It would fall down to free cash if no one was hired.

2025
02:38:24,676 --> 02:38:27,357
Okay, so it would just fall into free cash or free spending.

2026
02:38:27,397 --> 02:38:31,440
Or you could use it prior to the year transfers, maybe?

2027
02:38:31,460 --> 02:38:33,921
Yep, well, we could use it in year-end transfer and year-end, correct.

2028
02:38:34,902 --> 02:38:41,626
So ultimately we have about $620,000 worth of money that may or may not be on account for where it's going to be spent in the budget if these caps never come before.

2029
02:38:43,286 --> 02:38:47,048
It depends on how your body votes on the caps in July that the mayor submits.

2030
02:38:47,829 --> 02:38:48,929
What if we never get them in July?

2031
02:38:49,129 --> 02:38:52,971
I'm saying right now we're being asked to appropriate $620,000, right?

2032
02:38:53,152 --> 02:38:57,034
Well over half a million dollars to fund positions that don't exist.

2033
02:38:57,534 --> 02:38:59,695
What if we fund them and then the positions never come before us?

2034
02:39:00,115 --> 02:39:01,836
What if that money is now spent, right?

2035
02:39:04,217 --> 02:39:08,338
Yeah, respectfully through the chair, I think that the mayor stated that she's going to submit it to you in July.

2036
02:39:08,358 --> 02:39:10,058
Right, right.

2037
02:39:10,278 --> 02:39:10,838
Things happen though.

2038
02:39:10,979 --> 02:39:11,419
You know what I mean?

2039
02:39:11,459 --> 02:39:11,939
That's what I want.

2040
02:39:12,259 --> 02:39:13,019
That's what I want to be sure.

2041
02:39:13,039 --> 02:39:21,481
I think that we're going to, how can we spend 650,000 or $620,000 worth of money and not know if we're ever going to get the paper?

2042
02:39:21,801 --> 02:39:25,582
Why don't we get the paper, approve the paper and then fund the paper for the positions that it's bought?

2043
02:39:25,882 --> 02:39:28,022
I mean, I just, I think that's what makes sense.

2044
02:39:28,402 --> 02:39:29,523
I think that's what really makes sense.

2045
02:39:29,563 --> 02:39:30,883
There's no guarantee we're ever going to get a paper.

2046
02:39:31,338 --> 02:39:32,299
I know that, you know what I mean?

2047
02:39:32,399 --> 02:39:33,139
That things happen.

2048
02:39:33,239 --> 02:39:35,201
You know, she gets, may get struck by lightning tomorrow.

2049
02:39:35,681 --> 02:39:36,321
You know what I mean?

2050
02:39:36,341 --> 02:39:38,483
For all we know, we never get the data.

2051
02:39:38,583 --> 02:39:42,265
You know, but the $620,000, it's quite a chunk of change.

2052
02:39:42,665 --> 02:39:44,226
So it's not, it's not chump change.

2053
02:39:44,667 --> 02:39:48,109
And it's not something that I think anybody behind this rail is opposed to discussing.

2054
02:39:48,869 --> 02:39:51,151
We just want to have the conversation the right way.

2055
02:39:51,171 --> 02:39:52,832
We want to have the process done the right way.

2056
02:39:52,852 --> 02:39:56,134
You know, we could reduce the budget by the positions that don't have caps.

2057
02:39:56,664 --> 02:39:57,524
Take a vote on the budget.

2058
02:39:57,684 --> 02:39:59,665
You could bring that back to the supplemental spending paper.

2059
02:39:59,705 --> 02:40:00,785
We can do this thing the right way.

2060
02:40:01,085 --> 02:40:02,005
It's about the process.

2061
02:40:02,065 --> 02:40:02,845
It's about the process.

2062
02:40:03,065 --> 02:40:04,186
Maybe that's really what it's about.

2063
02:40:04,826 --> 02:40:07,286
Do I have a problem bringing parking in-house?

2064
02:40:07,466 --> 02:40:08,267
Not particularly.

2065
02:40:08,647 --> 02:40:12,508
Do I have a problem appropriating $350,000 for jobs that don't exist?

2066
02:40:12,848 --> 02:40:17,229
Yeah, big time, big time got a problem with that.

2067
02:40:17,289 --> 02:40:23,650
If I may, we will not hire without coming before you in July with the caps.

2068
02:40:24,204 --> 02:40:29,566
I served in this honorable body for 18 years and there was never discussions of caps.

2069
02:40:29,846 --> 02:40:32,887
We approved a budget and those positions were filled.

2070
02:40:33,187 --> 02:40:34,187
Nobody ever said a word.

2071
02:40:34,747 --> 02:40:40,589
This is an issue with the director, the prior director, hopefully now chief people officer.

2072
02:40:41,509 --> 02:40:42,310
It became an issue.

2073
02:40:42,330 --> 02:40:43,270
I hear you.

2074
02:40:43,290 --> 02:40:48,532
I tried to explain, we can collaborate during the budget process before you go to that position down.

2075
02:40:49,072 --> 02:40:49,592
I hear you.

2076
02:40:49,612 --> 02:40:52,093
I asked that you approve the budget tonight.

2077
02:40:53,057 --> 02:40:57,881
You've done many years on this council, and we will get you the CAFs.

2078
02:40:57,961 --> 02:40:58,741
I know you want to vote.

2079
02:41:01,023 --> 02:41:04,105
Your mic's off.

2080
02:41:04,125 --> 02:41:04,686
Your mic's off.

2081
02:41:04,966 --> 02:41:05,526
My mic's off.

2082
02:41:06,147 --> 02:41:09,249
I don't know how long it was off for.

2083
02:41:09,269 --> 02:41:10,090
Just for a second.

2084
02:41:10,450 --> 02:41:12,912
Yeah, we put that in writing to you, I think, in a response.

2085
02:41:13,092 --> 02:41:18,396
We would be before you in July with the CAFs, especially the ones that we want to hire as soon as possible.

2086
02:41:18,576 --> 02:41:20,397
Elections is important as our,

2087
02:41:21,762 --> 02:41:30,624
parking because that six month process and we need all six months with the director on board to get to get that parking to bring parking in house.

2088
02:41:30,664 --> 02:41:35,605
So we we hear you now we understand what the solicitors opinion is and we will we will do it.

2089
02:41:35,625 --> 02:41:38,786
I'll step out.

2090
02:41:38,826 --> 02:41:41,406
No, I think that the mayor answered the question.

2091
02:41:41,426 --> 02:41:44,287
I think what we're seeing is the chicken or the egg.

2092
02:41:44,907 --> 02:41:48,888
And um, if uh,

2093
02:41:50,092 --> 02:42:01,101
You know, I think you get to the question that there was a fundamental, uh, misunderstanding with the process with chief staff and the solicitor.

2094
02:42:01,882 --> 02:42:06,606
Um, so like I said, I think you answered my question.

2095
02:42:06,626 --> 02:42:08,667
So thank you.

2096
02:42:09,948 --> 02:42:10,749
Thank you, Mr. President.

2097
02:42:10,789 --> 02:42:17,815
Just if I could get this all clear and then I'm not precluding any further questions on the matter, but hopefully try to

2098
02:42:19,022 --> 02:42:23,106
come to a consensus and get this CAF thing into a clear place for everyone to be understanding.

2099
02:42:24,867 --> 02:42:35,597
It's your commitment that any position that currently doesn't have a CAF that will be funded through this budget at our July meeting, we will have a CAF change proposal in front of this council for that position.

2100
02:42:38,359 --> 02:42:44,645
Yes, I don't know how long it takes to prep a CAF, but we will not hire before our CAF is approved by this city council.

2101
02:42:45,793 --> 02:42:47,793
Okay, so that's my statement.

2102
02:42:47,833 --> 02:42:48,934
That's a blanket commitment.

2103
02:42:49,174 --> 02:42:51,234
And so no position will be hired.

2104
02:42:52,694 --> 02:42:58,475
No contract will be signed for job until it is the cap is approved by this council.

2105
02:42:58,675 --> 02:42:58,995
Right.

2106
02:42:59,055 --> 02:43:03,116
And then your hope is to get as many as possible to us by July, especially the most urgent positions.

2107
02:43:03,556 --> 02:43:03,816
Correct.

2108
02:43:04,096 --> 02:43:12,038
And then there's also a commitment, I believe in the communication to review the entire cap and review all positions in the city to make sure that they're all fitting within a cap.

2109
02:43:12,798 --> 02:43:13,918
And that would come at some point

2110
02:43:15,010 --> 02:43:18,031
probably after July, but we're gonna try to get it done, yes.

2111
02:43:18,111 --> 02:43:19,731
August or September.

2112
02:43:19,971 --> 02:43:21,151
And that's a little bit more sensitive.

2113
02:43:21,251 --> 02:43:23,572
Those roles are filled with people.

2114
02:43:23,912 --> 02:43:27,853
So, yes, but we will try to clean it up.

2115
02:43:28,253 --> 02:43:30,874
Sometime throughout the summer and fall, we'll try to clean them all up.

2116
02:43:30,914 --> 02:43:31,774
There are a number of them.

2117
02:43:32,074 --> 02:43:32,994
Is there a potential?

2118
02:43:33,034 --> 02:43:35,335
Most of them that I did not even hire or create.

2119
02:43:35,615 --> 02:43:36,695
Almost all of them.

2120
02:43:37,715 --> 02:43:38,136
I hear that.

2121
02:43:38,216 --> 02:43:44,297
And then, so for future, either supplemental budgets or next fiscal year budget, assuming,

2122
02:43:45,905 --> 02:43:58,593
you know, assuming, yeah, just next fiscal year budget, this administration would submit a cap change for any new positions, either at the same time or before those positions were requested to be funded?

2123
02:44:00,034 --> 02:44:01,134
That makes sense.

2124
02:44:01,735 --> 02:44:02,475
For next year, yes.

2125
02:44:02,915 --> 02:44:04,156
And you could commit to that?

2126
02:44:04,176 --> 02:44:05,977
If I'm here, yes.

2127
02:44:06,278 --> 02:44:09,059
Okay, well, I didn't want to say it.

2128
02:44:09,540 --> 02:44:13,222
Assuming that this administration is the administration, that is helpful.

2129
02:44:13,262 --> 02:44:13,582
Thank you.

2130
02:44:13,602 --> 02:44:13,742
Okay.

2131
02:44:16,401 --> 02:44:17,341
Mr. President, Madam Mayor.

2132
02:44:17,781 --> 02:44:23,343
So as far as the, these caps here, the ones that we're questioning tonight.

2133
02:44:23,783 --> 02:44:26,124
So I just wanna make sure I get clarification.

2134
02:44:26,164 --> 02:44:31,506
So were these deliberately not sent out?

2135
02:44:31,526 --> 02:44:34,527
Were they deliberately not presented to us, like as far as?

2136
02:44:36,187 --> 02:44:42,609
No, point of information on that, Councilor Falco, actually the longest thing for us was the ARPA money.

2137
02:44:43,404 --> 02:44:45,365
and we weren't sure how to treat the ARPA money.

2138
02:44:45,705 --> 02:44:58,471
And because it took a long time to get some guidance from the United States treasury, once we had that and we knew what funding we could use, then we were kind of rushing as fast as we could to figure out the priorities and what we could fund because in the beginning we had a deficit.

2139
02:44:58,971 --> 02:45:02,213
So it wasn't, there was never an intention to withhold any papers.

2140
02:45:02,913 --> 02:45:12,398
It was just the unknown with the ARPA funds and just rushing at the end to get everything together and get that funding in place and know what we're going, we're able to fund.

2141
02:45:13,188 --> 02:45:14,249
that this came this way.

2142
02:45:15,309 --> 02:45:16,970
So are these all being funded by ARPA?

2143
02:45:18,051 --> 02:45:25,796
No, not everything is being funded by ARPA, but because we were able to use ARPA, we were able to fund positions that we weren't able to before.

2144
02:45:26,937 --> 02:45:27,237
Thank you.

2145
02:45:28,738 --> 02:45:34,982
But if I may, still, wouldn't you, I would think you'd still send the caps down.

2146
02:45:35,002 --> 02:45:41,466
I mean, if this is part of the budget proposal and you know, I have 11 new jobs and I want to put in front of the council, I want to include in the budget,

2147
02:45:42,244 --> 02:45:45,467
I mean, I would think that that would still come down to us.

2148
02:45:45,627 --> 02:45:49,851
You'd still send those caps to us for approval.

2149
02:45:49,911 --> 02:45:51,693
I feel like that's the disconnect.

2150
02:45:51,753 --> 02:45:56,978
I mean, we got the budget, I think it was June 1st or maybe the first week of June.

2151
02:45:57,599 --> 02:46:03,144
So I know the budget process is lengthy and you've probably been working on it since February, March, April, May.

2152
02:46:03,605 --> 02:46:07,008
I mean, so I know it's a long time and I know, I'm sure,

2153
02:46:07,486 --> 02:46:09,527
You know, you have goals and initiatives that you want to accomplish.

2154
02:46:09,547 --> 02:46:11,749
And you're like, okay, I want to bring parking in house.

2155
02:46:11,789 --> 02:46:13,870
I want to make sure I have a new person in recreation.

2156
02:46:13,930 --> 02:46:16,652
I want to make sure that we have a facilities manager.

2157
02:46:16,812 --> 02:46:19,214
Facilities manager has been talked about for a long time.

2158
02:46:19,794 --> 02:46:29,040
So I would think like those there would have definitely been part of a cap package that was sent to this council, maybe in a pre-budget meeting where you say, you know, this is what I want in the budget.

2159
02:46:29,541 --> 02:46:31,482
I want to work with the council to get this done.

2160
02:46:32,403 --> 02:46:35,605
And I feel like that's like the disconnect, like these here,

2161
02:46:37,510 --> 02:46:45,432
It was, in my eyes, there was plenty of time to get these to come to us before we got to the point where we had to vote on this tonight.

2162
02:46:46,792 --> 02:46:53,294
To that, you've spent a lot of hours, probably 30 hours on the budget.

2163
02:46:53,634 --> 02:46:57,955
You have the ability to line item veto, which you're taking advantage of.

2164
02:46:57,975 --> 02:47:07,238
I don't wanna have city staff prepping 10, 11 different caps if you're gonna line item veto a position.

2165
02:47:07,733 --> 02:47:15,437
These are easier to solve because they're new positions and we can present you with the cap in a couple of weeks and then hire those positions.

2166
02:47:15,957 --> 02:47:22,140
The problem came with last year and Mr. Osborne's position of human resources and diversity.

2167
02:47:22,180 --> 02:47:23,141
And I understand that.

2168
02:47:23,401 --> 02:47:27,523
And that's where we kind of realized the historic mistake that's been made.

2169
02:47:27,963 --> 02:47:32,065
So I think council bears hit the nail on the head.

2170
02:47:32,145 --> 02:47:35,187
If that's what the council chooses for the next budget,

2171
02:47:36,032 --> 02:47:44,574
position proposed, there'd be a cap associated even before the budget's approved, even though they could be line item vetoed and it will be a waste of work, then we'll do it.

2172
02:47:44,894 --> 02:47:54,616
But- I don't understand how creating an ordinance that establishes a classification scale for employees is a waste of work.

2173
02:47:54,836 --> 02:47:56,196
I mean, ultimately- You're gonna cut it.

2174
02:47:56,276 --> 02:47:57,556
It's transparent, right?

2175
02:47:57,576 --> 02:48:00,397
So you go and you create the classification, you create the cap, all right?

2176
02:48:00,497 --> 02:48:01,697
That gets approved by this body.

2177
02:48:02,097 --> 02:48:04,258
It has to go through three readings just like anything else, right?

2178
02:48:05,708 --> 02:48:08,409
Okay, it has to happen, right?

2179
02:48:08,429 --> 02:48:09,849
It has to happen if you're creating a position.

2180
02:48:10,950 --> 02:48:20,553
So I'm not feeling how this is a waste of time or a waste of anybody's energy or effort in presenting a proposal before us to have it done the right way, all right?

2181
02:48:21,073 --> 02:48:22,234
The budget's a spending bill.

2182
02:48:22,814 --> 02:48:24,174
That's a whole different ball of wax.

2183
02:48:24,254 --> 02:48:26,355
The creation of the position is the creation of the position.

2184
02:48:26,955 --> 02:48:30,817
There could be things that come into play if you create a position where we don't have any money.

2185
02:48:31,077 --> 02:48:32,237
We have to eliminate a position.

2186
02:48:32,277 --> 02:48:34,418
I believe that before I got on the council,

2187
02:48:34,858 --> 02:48:43,860
you led the charge to do such and take the Assistant Commissioner DPW's position out of the budget because of financial circumstances that have changed, right?

2188
02:48:44,140 --> 02:48:59,663
So that's always something that's gonna be on the table that this council might exercise its line item veto rights because that's the action that might be necessary to be taken in the best interest of the taxpayers in this community and in the best interest of financial responsibility.

2189
02:49:00,318 --> 02:49:13,581
So to say that, you know, we're going to put in the budget first and you fund it because we don't want to come before you and then have you not approve the calf is strange to me, get the calf approved and then fund the spending bill.

2190
02:49:14,121 --> 02:49:17,022
That is an operational manual for the next year.

2191
02:49:17,522 --> 02:49:22,123
I mean, right now we have $620,000 being thrown against the wall for positions that don't exist.

2192
02:49:22,603 --> 02:49:23,784
I want to buy the iPhone 25 so that

2193
02:49:25,361 --> 02:49:27,162
I want it so bad, but it doesn't exist.

2194
02:49:27,422 --> 02:49:30,283
There is no such thing as the iPhone 25, you know?

2195
02:49:30,483 --> 02:49:43,367
So it's just from a standpoint of financial responsibility as stewards of money in this community, as stewards of money in this community, how do we expend $620,000 for positions that don't exist?

2196
02:49:44,107 --> 02:49:48,469
It's very, very, very hard for me to swallow, all right?

2197
02:49:48,489 --> 02:49:51,389
It's $620,000 positions that don't exist.

2198
02:49:51,590 --> 02:49:52,870
They've never been created.

2199
02:49:53,344 --> 02:49:55,445
We have a commitment from the administration saying it's going to happen.

2200
02:49:56,005 --> 02:49:57,525
When it happens is a whole different story.

2201
02:49:57,545 --> 02:50:02,787
We're going to fund this budget with all these positions that don't exist for a full 12-month period, for a full fiscal year.

2202
02:50:02,807 --> 02:50:09,550
For a full fiscal year, we're going to fund the position, but we never know when we're going to get the paper.

2203
02:50:09,590 --> 02:50:11,870
We're saying you get some of them in July, then we're going to do a review.

2204
02:50:13,371 --> 02:50:14,111
Let's make this easy.

2205
02:50:14,391 --> 02:50:19,373
Let's take them out, put it back on the administration to put the paper together, to come with us and do it the right way.

2206
02:50:20,465 --> 02:50:21,245
I think we all want it.

2207
02:50:21,305 --> 02:50:22,286
There's some good things in this budget.

2208
02:50:22,306 --> 02:50:24,326
There's a lot of good things in this budget, Mr. President.

2209
02:50:24,366 --> 02:50:25,387
A lot of good things in this budget.

2210
02:50:25,847 --> 02:50:31,708
But I, in my right mind, cannot sit here and support spending $620,000 on things that don't exist.

2211
02:50:32,709 --> 02:50:33,449
They're figments right now.

2212
02:50:33,469 --> 02:50:34,169
They're just ideas.

2213
02:50:34,629 --> 02:50:35,370
They're just ideas.

2214
02:50:35,470 --> 02:50:37,970
Until we pass those classifications, they're just ideas.

2215
02:50:40,631 --> 02:50:46,033
Mr. President, I just feel like Councilor Knight, if I brought the cast before you,

2216
02:50:47,229 --> 02:50:50,051
three weeks ago, you would be arguing the opposite.

2217
02:50:50,111 --> 02:50:54,935
Why bring the caps when we haven't even finished reviewing the budget and we haven't approved the budget?

2218
02:50:55,295 --> 02:51:02,541
I mean, I think it's a level of respect probably here, but that's, I mean, it's just easy.

2219
02:51:02,581 --> 02:51:06,004
It's been pretty clarified what the level of respect is with this body.

2220
02:51:06,344 --> 02:51:08,346
No, no, no, just with you.

2221
02:51:08,426 --> 02:51:09,267
Excuse me.

2222
02:51:09,927 --> 02:51:15,912
I mean, quite frankly, the argument wouldn't be the opposite, Mr. President, because we have a proven track record and the record doesn't lie.

2223
02:51:16,504 --> 02:51:18,825
The record shows we've always done the cap before we do the money.

2224
02:51:18,845 --> 02:51:21,086
All right, we've always done the cap before we do the money.

2225
02:51:21,366 --> 02:51:25,648
Last year, this whole director of HR position, yeah, that was a mistake.

2226
02:51:25,688 --> 02:51:26,408
We never should have done that.

2227
02:51:26,709 --> 02:51:27,469
We never should have done it.

2228
02:51:27,989 --> 02:51:29,510
We never should have done it, Mr. President.

2229
02:51:29,790 --> 02:51:40,155
But I remember amending the caps under the Burke administration and under the McGlynn administration well prior to being requested to funnel, well prior to being requested to funnel.

2230
02:51:41,035 --> 02:51:45,337
And quite frankly, the argument wouldn't be the opposite because the record speaks for itself.

2231
02:51:46,390 --> 02:51:47,090
The history is there.

2232
02:51:47,851 --> 02:51:48,531
The history is there.

2233
02:51:50,132 --> 02:51:52,773
Mr. President.

2234
02:51:52,833 --> 02:51:58,616
Mr. President, at this point, I think the dog's chasing its tail right now.

2235
02:51:59,356 --> 02:52:03,638
And I'm at a point right now, I believe we have a commitment.

2236
02:52:03,738 --> 02:52:05,819
Am I happy how this rolled out?

2237
02:52:06,219 --> 02:52:07,020
No, I'm not happy.

2238
02:52:07,320 --> 02:52:10,541
Do I agree with my colleagues that this should have been presented ahead of time?

2239
02:52:11,101 --> 02:52:11,842
Absolutely.

2240
02:52:12,322 --> 02:52:14,423
But I'm hearing there's a commitment there, Mr. President.

2241
02:52:15,175 --> 02:52:22,420
And I think what I'm hoping is that the mayor will present this as quickly as possible, I'm hoping July.

2242
02:52:22,920 --> 02:52:34,507
But when you look at some of these positions that are new, a director of parking, we were told the other night that we are gonna take on a new parking program in-house January 1st.

2243
02:52:36,889 --> 02:52:38,990
It's almost July, Mr. President.

2244
02:52:39,871 --> 02:52:41,012
Time is of the essence.

2245
02:52:41,732 --> 02:52:44,694
So I can't see the administration holding off on these caps

2246
02:52:45,320 --> 02:52:52,383
when it's been their commitment, right, to provide parking enforcement in-house January 1st.

2247
02:52:53,043 --> 02:53:04,068
So I really believe that it's beneficial to the administration and crucial to the administration to keep their promises, not just to this council, but to the community.

2248
02:53:04,608 --> 02:53:09,311
So I feel very comfortable that these caps are gonna be presented to us.

2249
02:53:09,711 --> 02:53:12,812
And I know moving forward, they'll be presented ahead of time.

2250
02:53:12,852 --> 02:53:14,913
So I feel, I have to say, I feel comfortable.

2251
02:53:15,791 --> 02:53:16,171
with that.

2252
02:53:16,592 --> 02:53:19,353
You know, we talk about facilities manager for years.

2253
02:53:20,154 --> 02:53:25,978
I think there's a plan in place to create a facilities manager to oversee on the municipal side.

2254
02:53:25,998 --> 02:53:37,885
There's one on the school side, but on the municipal side to look at all our buildings to make sure we're never faced again with a dilapidated DPW building, outdated police station, outdated fire stations.

2255
02:53:38,346 --> 02:53:44,930
So I believe that's a commitment that if the mayor doesn't follow through with, it says, you know what, I'm not going to give them that cap for that position.

2256
02:53:46,374 --> 02:53:47,494
That doesn't hurt the council.

2257
02:53:48,634 --> 02:53:49,855
That's the mayor's commitment.

2258
02:53:50,355 --> 02:53:51,815
That's the administration's commitment.

2259
02:53:52,915 --> 02:53:56,036
That's one of those promises, Mr. President, that I read about.

2260
02:53:56,916 --> 02:54:01,917
So I feel comfortable that these positions are of utmost importance.

2261
02:54:02,557 --> 02:54:03,937
I'm not happy with the process.

2262
02:54:04,297 --> 02:54:05,577
I agree with council on that.

2263
02:54:05,877 --> 02:54:08,978
But I think at this point now, I really believe so.

2264
02:54:09,178 --> 02:54:13,479
And I wish we got it, like Councilor Falco mentioned, maybe several weeks ago and discussed this.

2265
02:54:13,499 --> 02:54:14,639
But at this point,

2266
02:54:15,383 --> 02:54:20,906
I think, you know, we're obligated to move forward and go based on the commitment, Mr. President.

2267
02:54:21,527 --> 02:54:33,974
And, you know, I supported removing the money for the legal counsel, but at this point for these positions, I think we're gonna move forward with them, Mr. President.

2268
02:54:34,234 --> 02:54:42,279
And, you know, in the past, don't forget, we've had years, and I remember being on the council where they'll say they're gonna hire 18 new firefighters.

2269
02:54:42,799 --> 02:54:44,680
And at the end of the fiscal year, we hired three.

2270
02:54:45,366 --> 02:54:47,566
and there were $300,000 left over.

2271
02:54:48,107 --> 02:54:49,927
It happens a lot, Mr. President.

2272
02:54:50,627 --> 02:54:58,608
And for whatever reason, sometimes they're unable to get the people on board quick enough.

2273
02:54:59,008 --> 02:55:02,069
They're unable to vet them or so forth, but it happens quite often.

2274
02:55:02,449 --> 02:55:04,710
I don't think that's gonna be the case with these positions.

2275
02:55:05,290 --> 02:55:09,370
So I appreciate the fiscal responsibility.

2276
02:55:09,810 --> 02:55:10,971
I appreciate the leverage.

2277
02:55:11,331 --> 02:55:12,691
I'll be the first to always talk about

2278
02:55:13,142 --> 02:55:14,002
That's use the leverage.

2279
02:55:14,022 --> 02:55:18,724
If we have the leverage that's using, and I think that's an excellent way of using leverage.

2280
02:55:19,144 --> 02:55:24,846
Take it out of the budget now and say, Madam Mayor, when you come with the caps, we'll put it back in, like the supplemental, like the last issue.

2281
02:55:25,126 --> 02:55:26,206
That's a great way of doing it.

2282
02:55:26,647 --> 02:55:28,447
I don't think with these, we have to do that.

2283
02:55:29,508 --> 02:55:33,189
Now, if the mayor proves me wrong, then I'll apologize to my colleague.

2284
02:55:33,489 --> 02:55:36,150
But at this point, I don't think we need to go down that direction.

2285
02:55:36,570 --> 02:55:37,410
Council Member, I appreciate it.

2286
02:55:37,430 --> 02:55:38,050
It's not about me.

2287
02:55:38,270 --> 02:55:38,971
It's about me at all.

2288
02:55:38,991 --> 02:55:40,591
It's about the taxpayers and the taxpayer at all.

2289
02:55:40,631 --> 02:55:41,512
That's all this is about.

2290
02:55:41,732 --> 02:55:42,712
It's not personal at all.

2291
02:55:43,155 --> 02:55:50,236
And then that that's, that's what I'm not saying it's first I'm a little taken back by some comments, because not not by you, but in general, it's not personal at all.

2292
02:55:50,256 --> 02:55:59,138
It's about being a financial steward and a fiscal steward in this community, and making sure that you know, having been involved in government for 20 years we know how things work right and we want to make sure that we do things the right way.

2293
02:55:59,538 --> 02:56:02,739
And that's all this is about Mr. Mr. President and for you guys.

2294
02:56:03,419 --> 02:56:09,460
Ultimately, I think, no offense, you having a different opinion, a difference of opinion on this if you take a fence when you know

2295
02:56:09,855 --> 02:56:10,535
it becomes personal.

2296
02:56:10,595 --> 02:56:11,975
And this isn't personal between you and me at all.

2297
02:56:11,995 --> 02:56:13,436
No, this is not personal at all.

2298
02:56:13,556 --> 02:56:16,716
And this issue of spending is a personal matter, and I want that to be very clear.

2299
02:56:16,756 --> 02:56:24,998
And just so you know, my differences of opinion is how we go about this, not that what you stated was incorrect or by no stretch.

2300
02:56:25,318 --> 02:56:27,598
I actually voted on your last proposal.

2301
02:56:27,958 --> 02:56:31,799
I just think we don't have to go down in this one direction on this.

2302
02:56:32,159 --> 02:56:38,740
Now, Mr. President, as we go through this budget, I have a laundry list of other items, Mr. President,

2303
02:56:39,070 --> 02:56:40,050
that I will be bringing up.

2304
02:56:40,490 --> 02:56:54,233
So these are just, this is the, these are the items that they may have presented to us of just recent, I believe yesterday and today, but I have a number of other items that were not addressed Mr. President.

2305
02:56:54,593 --> 02:56:58,913
So, you know, at some point I'd like to go through those as well, but I just want them to be on the record.

2306
02:56:59,994 --> 02:57:07,275
I think we have to move forward with this issue is gone full circle, I think.

2307
02:57:07,935 --> 02:57:08,195
Thank you.

2308
02:57:09,462 --> 02:57:10,283
Thank you, Mr. President.

2309
02:57:10,483 --> 02:57:12,084
And I want to thank my colleagues.

2310
02:57:12,144 --> 02:57:15,047
I know everyone has different thoughts on this.

2311
02:57:15,508 --> 02:57:20,792
But I know with this here, I mean, this is a 305, 306-page budget book.

2312
02:57:20,812 --> 02:57:24,356
A lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of work goes into this.

2313
02:57:24,376 --> 02:57:29,941
And the way I look at it is this is the administration's plan to move the city forward.

2314
02:57:32,840 --> 02:57:37,041
confidence in the plan, it's gotta be a full package and they have to wanna work with us.

2315
02:57:37,101 --> 02:57:40,742
So it's like, I understand there could be a line item B, I get that.

2316
02:57:41,322 --> 02:57:44,863
But at the end of the day, it's gotta come with a cap.

2317
02:57:45,043 --> 02:57:47,584
It's gotta come with a 10 caps, 11 caps, whatever it is.

2318
02:57:48,624 --> 02:57:55,466
So we can work together, we can know what's the plan and what do we need to do to move the process forward?

2319
02:57:56,426 --> 02:58:00,407
If you get a budget with no caps, it's kinda like, well, you got a budget but,

2320
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:03,821
We're hoping you approve the jobs.

2321
02:58:04,782 --> 02:58:07,625
So, I mean, the way I look at it is there's gotta be confidence here.

2322
02:58:07,685 --> 02:58:08,465
This is the budget.

2323
02:58:08,966 --> 02:58:09,666
These are the caps.

2324
02:58:09,927 --> 02:58:11,408
This is our plan to move forward.

2325
02:58:12,089 --> 02:58:14,891
And that's the message I'm not getting.

2326
02:58:15,952 --> 02:58:18,834
The caps need to be approved before the budgets.

2327
02:58:20,676 --> 02:58:27,502
I mean, I feel strongly that the caps do have to be approved.

2328
02:58:28,190 --> 02:58:30,251
I mean, I've only been on a council for six years.

2329
02:58:30,411 --> 02:58:31,652
That's the process that I know.

2330
02:58:32,113 --> 02:58:33,553
That's a process I'm familiar with.

2331
02:58:33,573 --> 02:58:35,355
That's the right way to go about it.

2332
02:58:35,775 --> 02:58:40,258
I mean, last year when we went through the process with the caps, someone was being paid out of cap.

2333
02:58:40,918 --> 02:58:45,301
We voted it down and they're still being paid out of cap from what I know.

2334
02:58:47,062 --> 02:58:48,543
And I don't want to go down that road again.

2335
02:58:50,564 --> 02:58:54,286
Because every time we mentioned it, that person's still getting paid out of cap.

2336
02:58:56,455 --> 02:59:00,196
No correction has been made as far as I know, unless my colleagues know of something else.

2337
02:59:02,257 --> 02:59:03,997
Thank you.

2338
02:59:08,898 --> 02:59:19,701
I mean, well, the only reason I asked you to go first is because I'm hoping you come to an end of the roundabout on the cap.

2339
02:59:21,262 --> 02:59:22,922
I agree with Councilor Marks.

2340
02:59:24,653 --> 02:59:32,336
I feel like there's a commitment made, not just in the short term, but also in the long term, that the process will be followed the way that we're all saying it to be followed in the future.

2341
02:59:32,356 --> 02:59:37,277
And to be honest, the main reason I ask is because I'm only on my first question.

2342
02:59:37,377 --> 02:59:43,659
So if there is a motion on the caps, I would just hope it could be made, it could be debated, and it could be dispensed with.

2343
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:45,200
I'll certainly offer the motion.

2344
02:59:45,220 --> 02:59:52,262
I have no problem doing that because I can't, in my right mind, support a budget that spends $620,000 of funds that

2345
02:59:55,667 --> 03:00:05,254
necessarily going to a defined purpose without at least attempting, Mr. President, to offer a motion.

2346
03:00:05,314 --> 03:00:12,380
So the way I'd like to offer this motion, because I have all the line items, I have all the amounts and everything else, I'll offer the motion in a general format.

2347
03:00:12,460 --> 03:00:14,221
If we have to go back and address it, that's fine.

2348
03:00:14,662 --> 03:00:24,349
But my motion would be to reduce the city budget in the dollar amount equivalent to that

2349
03:00:30,041 --> 03:00:38,025
appropriated in the proposed fiscal year budget for the caps that don't exist.

2350
03:00:38,045 --> 03:00:41,567
It comes to $216,000 in exchange, Mr. President.

2351
03:00:41,767 --> 03:00:46,450
I'm sorry, what was the amount?

2352
03:00:46,670 --> 03:00:46,450
$217,390.

2353
03:00:46,950 --> 03:00:46,450
217,390?

2354
03:00:46,970 --> 03:00:50,492
617,390.

2355
03:00:49,632 --> 03:00:50,492
I'll offer that motion.

2356
03:00:50,712 --> 03:00:53,714
If we need to go to the line items after the fact, I'll be happy to pull those out.

2357
03:00:54,695 --> 03:00:58,877
It seems to me that there is not much of an appetite for this council to move in that direction.

2358
03:00:59,820 --> 03:01:01,140
However, I'd be happy to offer the motion.

2359
03:01:01,160 --> 03:01:04,141
Councilor Scarpelli.

2360
03:01:04,161 --> 03:01:06,201
Thank you, Mr. President.

2361
03:01:06,421 --> 03:01:16,023
One person that I can count on to be thorough is Councilor Knight, and I respect his input greatly.

2362
03:01:16,463 --> 03:01:23,984
But again, I think that Council Marks brings up a great point in where we are timeline-wise.

2363
03:01:24,064 --> 03:01:29,005
So I think that the commitment from the mayor right now

2364
03:01:29,828 --> 03:01:36,372
and understanding where we need to go with the timeline and these, these oppositions we wanted.

2365
03:01:37,113 --> 03:01:57,806
And, um, and I understand what council nights, um, commitment to the fiscal responsibility, but, um, I'm, I'm willing to, uh, move past that as well as council marks saying, and, um, with the commitment from the mayor that we move forward with these and then come back.

2366
03:01:57,886 --> 03:01:58,687
I think that, uh,

2367
03:01:59,509 --> 03:02:04,031
There has been a fundamental issue here and it has been debated.

2368
03:02:04,152 --> 03:02:09,254
We have worked very hard on this, this council, I think on the whole budget.

2369
03:02:10,015 --> 03:02:28,825
We spent a lot of time on this and, you know, I just don't want, I wanna give the benefit of the doubt and move forward with making sure that, you know, as we move forward, we're cleaning up the mistakes and the errors that we see in the fundamental

2370
03:02:29,246 --> 03:02:34,850
disagreements and lack of communication that we see both on the last issue and as we move forward with this.

2371
03:02:34,890 --> 03:02:36,311
So, uh, thank you.

2372
03:02:36,712 --> 03:02:38,953
Uh, listen to my input, Mr President.

2373
03:02:39,394 --> 03:02:41,275
Thank you, Mr President.

2374
03:02:41,295 --> 03:02:43,317
I'll be brief because it's the only way I know how to operate.

2375
03:02:43,417 --> 03:02:46,860
I just want to say I also agree with Councilor Marks and his many points.

2376
03:02:46,980 --> 03:02:48,601
I try my best to act in good faith.

2377
03:02:48,641 --> 03:02:49,782
We have a commitment from the mayor.

2378
03:02:50,162 --> 03:02:52,004
I'm going to act on that, and I agree.

2379
03:02:52,884 --> 03:02:53,725
I'm ready to move forward.

2380
03:02:59,938 --> 03:03:01,699
Check.

2381
03:03:01,819 --> 03:03:02,960
We have a motion on the floor.

2382
03:03:03,200 --> 03:03:05,442
There's a motion on the floor, Mr. President.

2383
03:03:05,502 --> 03:03:08,904
I appreciate everybody's commentary and their willingness to act in good faith.

2384
03:03:08,984 --> 03:03:19,111
I just would like to say that there is no guarantee that if this money gets appropriated, it's ever going to be used for what we're spending it for, number one.

2385
03:03:19,151 --> 03:03:23,594
And number two, you know, it is $617,390 that we're appropriating that right now has no defined purpose.

2386
03:03:23,954 --> 03:03:24,695
The jobs don't exist.

2387
03:03:24,715 --> 03:03:26,416
They go to a place that doesn't exist.

2388
03:03:26,436 --> 03:03:27,837
So with that being said, that's my argument.

2389
03:03:28,370 --> 03:03:28,970
for this matter, right?

2390
03:03:28,990 --> 03:03:35,195
That's the motion to be brought up for a vote.

2391
03:03:39,158 --> 03:03:40,579
It mentions such a comprehensive.

2392
03:03:40,599 --> 03:03:42,380
We have a, it's on the memo that we received the email.

2393
03:03:42,460 --> 03:03:45,543
I shall say that we received earlier today.

2394
03:03:45,563 --> 03:03:46,303
This talks about the caps.

2395
03:03:58,380 --> 03:04:08,605
Such a comprehensive review can take place as part of the planned salary study to be pursued through the Commonwealth Community Compact Grant Program, which will assist to untangle this issue.

2396
03:04:08,645 --> 03:04:09,645
Do we know when that's happening?

2397
03:04:12,126 --> 03:04:17,909
I think that also has to do with your question on

2398
03:04:18,983 --> 03:04:23,404
salaries of different employees and doing a whole salary study.

2399
03:04:23,484 --> 03:04:27,845
So the community compact, you're allowed to get up to two grants every two years.

2400
03:04:28,185 --> 03:04:30,846
We can apply for a new one in the late fall.

2401
03:04:33,247 --> 03:04:41,949
Have you received the grant to conduct this study or is this a grant that we will have to apply for and competitively bid for?

2402
03:04:42,529 --> 03:04:43,169
No bid.

2403
03:04:43,449 --> 03:04:44,789
We applied for two.

2404
03:04:44,929 --> 03:04:46,330
We received two January 2020.

2405
03:04:49,666 --> 03:04:54,430
January 2020, we didn't qualify for them this January, because it's every other year.

2406
03:04:54,490 --> 03:05:00,754
So we will qualify for up to two more as far as I believe in January 2022.

2407
03:05:00,794 --> 03:05:14,525
And this would be the one we would ask for first to do a comprehensive, because it was on the list of what we wanted to do anyway, comprehensive study of organizational charts and salaries, comprehensive salary study.

2408
03:05:16,246 --> 03:05:18,968
So we qualify, but we don't know if we have the grant yet, correct?

2409
03:05:19,323 --> 03:05:19,763
That's correct.

2410
03:05:21,004 --> 03:05:21,944
So we don't have it yet.

2411
03:05:23,124 --> 03:05:24,945
We haven't received the grant to do this.

2412
03:05:25,425 --> 03:05:26,946
No, that's just a plan.

2413
03:05:27,086 --> 03:05:28,627
So it's a plan, we're hoping to do this.

2414
03:05:29,347 --> 03:05:33,268
Correct, we're hoping to do the structural analysis with salaries, yes.

2415
03:05:33,889 --> 03:05:34,149
Thank you.

2416
03:05:35,189 --> 03:05:37,630
Okay, so can you read back the motion please, Mr. President?

2417
03:05:39,691 --> 03:05:40,251
Mr. Clerk.

2418
03:05:42,132 --> 03:05:45,413
Council 9's motion is to reduce the city budget in the dollar amount equivalent

2419
03:05:46,143 --> 03:05:49,565
to that appropriated in the fiscal year budget in caps that don't exist.

2420
03:05:49,985 --> 03:05:52,066
And the dollar figure associated with that is $617,390.

2421
03:05:52,106 --> 03:05:54,288
And so we have a motion on the floor, Vice President.

2422
03:05:54,328 --> 03:05:57,209
I second it by second second by Councilor.

2423
03:06:26,519 --> 03:06:27,099
Councilor Behrs?

2424
03:06:27,319 --> 03:06:27,559
No.

2425
03:06:29,260 --> 03:06:29,881
Councilor Falco?

2426
03:06:30,061 --> 03:06:30,281
Yes.

2427
03:06:31,181 --> 03:06:31,921
Vice President Knight?

2428
03:06:33,242 --> 03:06:33,542
Yes.

2429
03:06:34,383 --> 03:06:34,943
Councilor Marks?

2430
03:06:35,223 --> 03:06:35,443
No.

2431
03:06:37,064 --> 03:06:37,644
Councilor Morrell?

2432
03:06:37,944 --> 03:06:38,144
No.

2433
03:06:39,045 --> 03:06:39,805
Councilor Scarpelli?

2434
03:06:39,945 --> 03:06:40,125
No.

2435
03:06:41,126 --> 03:06:41,926
President Caravaglia?

2436
03:06:42,126 --> 03:06:42,286
No.

2437
03:06:44,527 --> 03:06:47,969
So we have two in the affirmative, five in the negative.

2438
03:06:49,229 --> 03:06:49,829
Motion fails.

2439
03:06:50,850 --> 03:06:51,350
Mr. President?

2440
03:06:52,411 --> 03:06:52,911
Councilor Behrs?

2441
03:06:53,491 --> 03:06:54,491
May I continue my question?

2442
03:06:54,812 --> 03:06:55,572
You may resume your question.

2443
03:06:55,938 --> 03:07:01,202
Thank you, and I'll try to go with the easier ones first, because that won't turn into a whole debate.

2444
03:07:01,823 --> 03:07:13,792
A few just, I tried to note, we did get an updated budget submission today, and I was just trying to make sure I understood the differences between what we have in front of us now and what was submitted to us on June 3rd.

2445
03:07:14,873 --> 03:07:18,956
For planning, development, and sustainability, I noticed there's about a $4,500 decrease.

2446
03:07:21,352 --> 03:07:25,835
Is that due to the duplication of boards and commissions that was included in the PDS line?

2447
03:07:25,855 --> 03:07:27,536
That is correct.

2448
03:07:28,756 --> 03:07:29,657
Great, thank you.

2449
03:07:31,218 --> 03:07:39,262
For police and traffic supervisors, it looked to me like about $9,000 was transferred from police to traffic supervisors.

2450
03:07:40,203 --> 03:07:44,265
Could you just, I can't quite remember why that happened, but I think it may have come up.

2451
03:07:44,725 --> 03:07:45,966
Yeah, that was their clothing allowance.

2452
03:07:47,185 --> 03:07:51,528
Got it, and then in the DPW, there's a few things moving around.

2453
03:07:53,810 --> 03:08:12,264
Looks like about $30,000 more in highway, 6,000, oh, sorry, yeah, 6,000 less in cemetery, 4,000 less in parks, and looks like something like 50,000 more in facilities.

2454
03:08:12,364 --> 03:08:13,985
Could you just explain what those changes are?

2455
03:08:14,961 --> 03:08:21,063
Yep, so we moved the utilities, some that were still outstanding in the departments that should have been moved into facilities.

2456
03:08:21,123 --> 03:08:24,325
We reallocated those all into facilities.

2457
03:08:24,445 --> 03:08:25,665
We added $75,000 for sidewalks.

2458
03:08:25,685 --> 03:08:27,006
We added $25,000 for stumps.

2459
03:08:27,086 --> 03:08:28,026
We added $15,000 for tree planting.

2460
03:08:33,712 --> 03:08:40,417
We added 31,544 for that elections coordinator, even though I know you're talking about something else.

2461
03:08:40,497 --> 03:08:51,506
We added 4,000 into the ordinary for diversity department, and we added about an additional 10,000 to the diversity director's salary in the diversity budget.

2462
03:08:52,967 --> 03:08:55,629
Great, so those were two of my other questions.

2463
03:08:56,510 --> 03:08:58,451
On forestry, it looks like it's going up about $90,000.

2464
03:08:58,772 --> 03:09:02,815
You said that was tree removal and what else?

2465
03:09:04,223 --> 03:09:05,124
Stumps and tree planting.

2466
03:09:06,104 --> 03:09:06,324
Great.

2467
03:09:07,805 --> 03:09:07,985
Yep.

2468
03:09:08,946 --> 03:09:25,494
And then, okay, so that $14,000 or so in human resources, between both human resources and diversity, which are now split out, you said that's $4,000 for ordinary expenses and a $10,000 increase to the director's salary.

2469
03:09:25,814 --> 03:09:26,134
Correct.

2470
03:09:27,255 --> 03:09:27,675
Wonderful.

2471
03:09:27,755 --> 03:09:29,556
Those are all of my questions.

2472
03:09:29,696 --> 03:09:31,777
Thank you very much for your great work.

2473
03:09:33,788 --> 03:09:34,768
Councilor Baxter.

2474
03:09:37,089 --> 03:09:38,069
I'll yield to my colleague.

2475
03:09:38,530 --> 03:09:38,870
Thank you.

2476
03:09:38,890 --> 03:09:39,770
It's a quick question.

2477
03:09:39,810 --> 03:09:44,272
Councilor Beers mentioned, I think there was a line item for, was it trees?

2478
03:09:46,212 --> 03:09:48,553
There was an increase in, was it trees that you mentioned?

2479
03:09:49,073 --> 03:09:54,895
I believe Director Natalie Benjamin said that the forestry line item, there was increase for tree planting and stump removal.

2480
03:09:54,915 --> 03:09:55,575
And how much is that?

2481
03:09:55,595 --> 03:09:58,176
15,000 for tree planting and 25,000 for stump removal.

2482
03:10:02,654 --> 03:10:11,097
because when we had the budget hearings, I believe Councilor Marks, I believe you've mentioned that, you offered that as an amendment, but was it just trees or was it stumps as well?

2483
03:10:12,478 --> 03:10:18,981
The trees were the 15,000, then we asked for additional money for the 500 large stumps in the community.

2484
03:10:19,121 --> 03:10:20,281
I just wanted that clarification.

2485
03:10:20,341 --> 03:10:23,943
Okay, thank you.

2486
03:10:24,023 --> 03:10:24,983
Thank you, Mr. President.

2487
03:10:25,303 --> 03:10:30,906
And what I wanted to do was, we were fortunate enough to have the mayor here,

2488
03:10:32,354 --> 03:10:41,798
There's a few things, Mr. President, in the budget that, or we asked to be in the budget, or maybe partially funded in the budget that I have some concerns with.

2489
03:10:42,638 --> 03:10:56,023
And the first issue, Mr. President, is something that the Public Works Subcommittee has been working on under the direction of Chairman Beers, myself, and Councilor Falco.

2490
03:10:56,563 --> 03:11:01,225
And that is looking at the creation of a new ordinance to deal with

2491
03:11:02,043 --> 03:11:05,186
snow shoveling in our community.

2492
03:11:05,846 --> 03:11:31,326
And as part of the due diligence of the committee and meeting with the Brian Cairns, the head of DPW, meeting with the mayor's chief of staff, Dave Rodriguez, and meeting with the Chamber of Commerce, we have asked that the administration, in addition to potentially a new ordinance, also look at 26 miles of priority sidewalk.

2493
03:11:31,926 --> 03:11:43,892
that would create connectivity and all the business districts would create connectivity to our schools, to our senior housing, to our stores.

2494
03:11:44,772 --> 03:11:50,115
And I thought along with the committee that this was a great idea.

2495
03:11:51,395 --> 03:12:00,840
We were told at the time, because I mentioned about bringing up this in the budget and adding an additional 50,000 to the snow and ice budget,

2496
03:12:01,396 --> 03:12:12,898
And at the time, which I think makes a lot of sense that, Mr. President, the statutory requirements is once you increase the snow and ice budget, you have to have that same dollar amount in there every year.

2497
03:12:13,458 --> 03:12:15,259
And that hamstrings the city.

2498
03:12:15,779 --> 03:12:18,179
And I think that's the last thing we wanna do as a council.

2499
03:12:18,679 --> 03:12:28,621
However, Mr. President, we did receive what I thought was a commitment, and this is probably the third time of us, and now we have the chief executive officer here,

2500
03:12:29,497 --> 03:12:37,100
I believe we did receive a commitment that there would be money within the existing snow and ice to provide this.

2501
03:12:37,540 --> 03:12:58,027
We brought a figure of 26 miles, but give or take, I don't think we're hot fast on that number, but that there would be money within this year for this budget, for this snow period, from December to March, that we would provide that sidewalk priority listing throughout our community.

2502
03:12:58,779 --> 03:13:16,787
And I'm sure the mayor probably got wind of this, or if she hasn't, if this is the first time she's hearing about it, then I'd like to see if we can get some type of commitment, again, from the chief executive officer regarding this 26 miles of priority sidewalk in our community.

2503
03:13:18,128 --> 03:13:19,928
Madam Mayor.

2504
03:13:20,469 --> 03:13:21,769
Thank you, President Carvajal.

2505
03:13:24,522 --> 03:13:33,024
I have discussed this in great detail and I do see all the emails coming in from concerned residents and I know that your committee's worked hard on this.

2506
03:13:34,204 --> 03:13:40,965
Parking and snow and ice removal are my two summer projects.

2507
03:13:41,285 --> 03:13:52,807
And I think the figures that you were given in the committee meetings of how much that would cost to plow or use a sidewalk machine on 26 miles every storm

2508
03:13:53,355 --> 03:14:01,659
might be a bit off, but it is my hope that we can work out something to make sure our sidewalks are cleaned off.

2509
03:14:01,959 --> 03:14:05,041
And that includes the hiring that we're trying to go through.

2510
03:14:05,661 --> 03:14:14,346
The latest update with the hiring is we offered the job for the ME01 and it was accepted and now it's not.

2511
03:14:14,546 --> 03:14:18,328
So we're having a bit of a hard time, but we are actively pursuing hiring.

2512
03:14:18,725 --> 03:14:20,886
additional staff and DPW to help with this.

2513
03:14:21,867 --> 03:14:25,229
And then I'd like to purchase an additional sidewalk machine.

2514
03:14:25,629 --> 03:14:29,492
We only have one and it did break down over the last winter.

2515
03:14:29,552 --> 03:14:32,974
So that would be a huge help to this initiative.

2516
03:14:33,855 --> 03:14:42,980
So as a committee, we really haven't gone down that avenue yet, but I won't speak to my colleagues, but I don't think we were opposed to doing it in-house versus outsourcing.

2517
03:14:43,000 --> 03:14:48,484
We were gonna leave that up to the administration, whatever you thought financially and from a, you know,

2518
03:14:49,769 --> 03:14:51,890
a standpoint of personnel made sense.

2519
03:14:51,950 --> 03:14:55,513
So I just want to make sure that this is an important item.

2520
03:14:56,094 --> 03:15:01,378
And the creation of an ordinance may assist us in clearing our sidewalks to a certain extent.

2521
03:15:01,678 --> 03:15:13,847
But without the, you know, the input and the assistance from the city, I think we're never truly gonna get to a point where we see our sidewalks cleared off consistently.

2522
03:15:14,347 --> 03:15:15,909
So I just want to put that out there.

2523
03:15:16,349 --> 03:15:17,510
And I am

2524
03:15:18,151 --> 03:15:22,875
appreciative of the fact that that's one of your two top priorities over the summer.

2525
03:15:23,975 --> 03:15:29,259
My other question that I want to bring up, Mr. President, is regarding parking enforcement.

2526
03:15:30,320 --> 03:15:33,122
And this has been an issue near and dear to me for a lot of years.

2527
03:15:33,182 --> 03:15:45,232
I sat on the original Parking Enforcement Commission some years back that made the ultimate recommendations, of which 90% were not followed by that administration.

2528
03:15:45,672 --> 03:15:45,832
But

2529
03:15:46,218 --> 03:15:48,039
That's an argument for another time.

2530
03:15:49,319 --> 03:16:00,583
But Mr. President, we were told recently by the chief of staff, Dave Rodriguez, that come January 1st, the city was going to embark on taking parking enforcement in-house.

2531
03:16:01,243 --> 03:16:03,724
And I don't think that's incorrect.

2532
03:16:03,764 --> 03:16:05,005
If I am, let me know.

2533
03:16:05,045 --> 03:16:08,446
But I think that's what the administration is currently looking at.

2534
03:16:08,466 --> 03:16:11,767
So that is January 1st, Mr. President.

2535
03:16:12,247 --> 03:16:14,388
What is outlined in the budget for parking

2536
03:16:15,844 --> 03:16:16,885
somewhat troubles me.

2537
03:16:17,866 --> 03:16:33,720
And the reason why I bring this up, Mr President, is the existing or the existing contract with Park Method calls for the enforcement of only a certain percentage of our streets in our city.

2538
03:16:34,300 --> 03:16:36,983
So Park Method does not enforce the entire city.

2539
03:16:37,903 --> 03:16:41,667
I would hope, Mr President, moving forward, if we are going to

2540
03:16:42,453 --> 03:16:47,256
move forward with in-house parking, that we're looking at this as an entire city.

2541
03:16:47,616 --> 03:16:51,738
It's no longer going to be, we're just going to enforce resident permit parking streets.

2542
03:16:52,038 --> 03:16:57,061
We're going to have to enforce every street in this community and provide the same enforcement.

2543
03:16:57,621 --> 03:17:11,728
The current budget, Mr. President, calls for meeting the levels of park method that doesn't meet the requirements that I believe should meet by enforcing the entire city.

2544
03:17:12,487 --> 03:17:26,920
So that being said, Mr. President, $350,601 may be what currently we can do to meet the level that Park Method is doing currently right now, but that's not the entire city.

2545
03:17:27,661 --> 03:17:37,930
And when we talk about running a full-fledged department, which I hope that ultimately that's the goal, I realize it's not gonna start on day one.

2546
03:17:37,990 --> 03:17:38,390
I'm not naive.

2547
03:17:39,258 --> 03:17:41,298
And I realize there's a lot of working parts.

2548
03:17:41,578 --> 03:17:45,839
We have to look at permanent parking, how we're going to approach that citywide or by district.

2549
03:17:46,339 --> 03:17:53,560
You know, we have to look at a lot of things, Mr. President, but this current budget doesn't call for collections.

2550
03:17:54,581 --> 03:18:02,882
So you have three parking enforcement salaries and a head of parking enforcement, but you also need someone to collect.

2551
03:18:02,962 --> 03:18:08,443
So if we end up going to double headed meters or stick with the kiosk, you need to have

2552
03:18:08,903 --> 03:18:12,524
an entity, a body that collects the revenue from these machines.

2553
03:18:13,044 --> 03:18:15,525
And it can't be the person that's giving the ticket out.

2554
03:18:16,345 --> 03:18:17,526
It just doesn't work that way.

2555
03:18:17,966 --> 03:18:21,567
So you're talking about hiring potentially someone to do the collections.

2556
03:18:21,967 --> 03:18:24,648
So that's not currently part of this program.

2557
03:18:25,268 --> 03:18:28,569
And it's a crucial part of any parking enforcement program.

2558
03:18:29,409 --> 03:18:30,590
Hearings, Mr. President.

2559
03:18:31,090 --> 03:18:35,391
Now, currently right now, the first line of hearings is done by Park Medford.

2560
03:18:35,811 --> 03:18:38,012
If you're not happy with that, you're able to come to the city

2561
03:18:38,586 --> 03:18:40,687
and get a second hearing, Mr. President.

2562
03:18:41,288 --> 03:18:51,394
Now with Park Meffitt out of the way, you're gonna increase the number of hearings and we only have the one hearing person that's doing it on a stipend right now.

2563
03:18:52,135 --> 03:19:01,581
And to me, that is not adequate enough with the influx of taking on the entire city and not just controlled streets, which Park Meffitt's doing.

2564
03:19:02,101 --> 03:19:05,964
And also the fact that Park Meffitt's hearings are gonna go away

2565
03:19:06,319 --> 03:19:10,061
and that's gonna be emphasized on the city of Method.

2566
03:19:10,401 --> 03:19:22,006
So we don't have hearing offices other than the person that we have right now that's in a full-time job that's doing it on the side, which I think we all can appreciate, that's not gonna be enough for hearings.

2567
03:19:22,786 --> 03:19:31,490
Maintenance, Mr. President, any department, parking department worth their weight has a maintenance department that can fix machines.

2568
03:19:31,550 --> 03:19:35,812
I mean, you go to any one of our kiosks, I was just at one on Salem Street,

2569
03:19:36,451 --> 03:19:39,712
In front of the old burial, I was parked there to go to the chess tournament.

2570
03:19:40,013 --> 03:19:42,854
I went up to feed the machine, and it said out of service.

2571
03:19:43,794 --> 03:19:50,217
So there are a number of machines, I'm sure, throughout the community that are out of service that we're going to inherit.

2572
03:19:51,237 --> 03:19:56,499
And whether or not we stick with that or not remains to be seen with the kiosks and meters.

2573
03:19:56,560 --> 03:19:57,860
I think that's a work in progress.

2574
03:19:58,340 --> 03:20:00,821
But maintenance is not included in this budget.

2575
03:20:01,562 --> 03:20:04,843
Also, Mr. President, when you call up Park Meffitt,

2576
03:20:05,500 --> 03:20:08,801
they have a staff of one of two people on staff there.

2577
03:20:09,201 --> 03:20:20,504
So at any given time, they have a staff person that picks up, they have another staff person that can look into issues, issue resident permit parking, issue all sorts of commuter parking stickers.

2578
03:20:20,924 --> 03:20:25,726
So you have at least one or two people in the office that'll handle that administrative role.

2579
03:20:26,386 --> 03:20:29,247
This parking enforcement doesn't cover that.

2580
03:20:29,847 --> 03:20:34,148
So as you can see, as it's set up, and I know this is a work in progress,

2581
03:20:34,713 --> 03:20:37,334
This is just a shell of a parking program.

2582
03:20:38,094 --> 03:20:51,159
And to have a full-fledged parking, I would venture to say that this budget would be either doubled or tripled in order to have a full-fledged parking program, which I think we all anticipate and expect in this community.

2583
03:20:51,599 --> 03:20:57,101
So those are the issues, Mr. President, that I wanted to bring up to the mayor that she's here now, which is great.

2584
03:20:57,521 --> 03:21:04,244
I brought it up to the chief of staff, and I think he was in agreement that this is just the start of it, but again,

2585
03:21:04,731 --> 03:21:09,894
We are doing the budget, and this will be implemented halfway through our budget period.

2586
03:21:10,514 --> 03:21:15,257
And unless we have a pot of money somewhere else, there's gonna be a startup cost.

2587
03:21:15,957 --> 03:21:27,383
And I wanna make sure if we implement this, that right away, we're not gonna get negativity saying, well, you put together a program, it doesn't provide this, this, and this, you're not doing my street.

2588
03:21:28,023 --> 03:21:29,504
We don't want that, Mr. President.

2589
03:21:30,044 --> 03:21:32,826
And I think if we can avoid that angst in the community,

2590
03:21:33,307 --> 03:21:36,489
I think we have to make sure that, uh, you know, that happens.

2591
03:21:36,529 --> 03:21:43,655
So I don't know if the mayor wants to speak to that or just take that under advisement, but I have some grave concerns.

2592
03:21:44,135 --> 03:21:47,638
So if someone says to me, Hey Mike, we're set for pocket enforcement January.

2593
03:21:48,638 --> 03:21:58,586
I have to say, well, it's being worked on, but according to the budget we passed, I don't believe there's enough money to create a full fledged parking enforcement.

2594
03:21:59,166 --> 03:22:01,168
So that remains to be seen as the president.

2595
03:22:01,208 --> 03:22:01,328
So.

2596
03:22:02,019 --> 03:22:03,480
I don't know if the mayor wants to say anything.

2597
03:22:03,541 --> 03:22:15,431
I don't wanna put her on the spot, but that's a concern I have with a portion of this budget, Mr. President, that I think we're all gonna vote for, but I don't have the utmost confidence that we're gonna provide that service.

2598
03:22:15,471 --> 03:22:16,252
Thank you, Mr. President.

2599
03:22:17,373 --> 03:22:18,073
I'll be brief.

2600
03:22:18,394 --> 03:22:19,395
I agree with you.

2601
03:22:19,475 --> 03:22:21,697
It's the beginning of a program.

2602
03:22:21,737 --> 03:22:24,960
I think it's probably gonna triple in expense come fiscal year 2023, 22, 23.

2603
03:22:31,111 --> 03:22:32,211
But we have to start somewhere.

2604
03:22:32,231 --> 03:22:51,497
We're starting it at a good time as well because through COVID, Park Medford has dwindled in staff and they've ramped up a little bit after the surges, but we still are coming off it at a good point where revenue is low.

2605
03:22:51,937 --> 03:22:56,758
And we know we can build from that and create a program that will work.

2606
03:22:57,098 --> 03:22:59,079
And we know we're gonna have to hire additional staff.

2607
03:23:01,338 --> 03:23:14,128
February, March, April, money will be coming in and will come before you to hire additional staff to make sure we're enforcing and making our neighborhoods, our business districts the right way for the best interest of our neighborhoods.

2608
03:23:14,748 --> 03:23:19,432
The reason why I say, Mr. President, you have one shot to make the first good impression.

2609
03:23:20,092 --> 03:23:26,017
And I would hate to see the program desk, because I believe strongly we should have done in-house from day one.

2610
03:23:26,597 --> 03:23:28,518
I believe strongly we should have had double-headed meters.

2611
03:23:28,839 --> 03:23:30,560
I believe strongly in a lot of these issues.

2612
03:23:31,205 --> 03:23:38,887
And I just don't want to set us up for failure that we're providing not enough funds in the budget to really run a full-fledged program.

2613
03:23:39,427 --> 03:23:46,309
And I don't want that to be the demise of this program, that people lose trust and faith in it if it's not rolled out appropriately.

2614
03:23:46,769 --> 03:23:51,311
I'd actually rather see us wait to roll it out in order to get a full-fledged program.

2615
03:23:51,531 --> 03:23:53,931
So I appreciate the comments from the administration.

2616
03:23:54,331 --> 03:23:59,693
Some other just small issues, and I'll be brief, Mr. President, because I know my colleagues have other stuff to mention.

2617
03:24:00,950 --> 03:24:01,771
road in control.

2618
03:24:02,452 --> 03:24:09,138
Just got a picture actually today from someone on the Felsway that showed me a giant dead rat in their backyard.

2619
03:24:09,998 --> 03:24:12,861
They went out and bought their own pellets and so forth.

2620
03:24:13,181 --> 03:24:19,987
The city actually came down and said, we can see nests, but they're in your neighbor's yard, they're in that neighbor's yard, and there's nothing we can do.

2621
03:24:20,668 --> 03:24:21,809
This council has requested

2622
03:24:22,172 --> 03:24:34,077
that we sign a waiver that the health department make up a waiver form that would allow the city to intervene and act when we do have a rodent issue that maybe residents can't afford to address.

2623
03:24:34,698 --> 03:24:39,440
Um, and this is an issue, uh, it's a, it's a community issue and it's a quality of life issue.

2624
03:24:39,860 --> 03:24:44,302
So I don't think we could just put our head in the sand and say, well, it's on private property.

2625
03:24:44,342 --> 03:24:45,203
The city can't assist.

2626
03:24:45,763 --> 03:24:46,043
And, uh,

2627
03:24:46,522 --> 03:24:50,585
The amount of money in the budget for road and control citywide is 13,000.

2628
03:24:50,985 --> 03:24:53,767
Anyone that's hired an exterminator knows they're not cheap.

2629
03:24:54,488 --> 03:24:59,111
And when they come out to your house, you're talking three or 400 a whack for an exterminator.

2630
03:24:59,412 --> 03:25:00,512
And that's on the low side.

2631
03:25:00,913 --> 03:25:08,498
So 13,000 citywide to address our concerns, I think is really appealing comparison of what needs to be done.

2632
03:25:08,719 --> 03:25:10,200
One information on that.

2633
03:25:10,380 --> 03:25:11,681
Sure.

2634
03:25:11,981 --> 03:25:14,503
That same resident contacted me right before he came here.

2635
03:25:16,442 --> 03:25:25,264
The question was that the health department instructed him that they're waiting on the council to allow them to go on the property.

2636
03:25:25,784 --> 03:25:29,645
So I think we need clarification from the solicitor, because I thought we were waiting for them.

2637
03:25:30,465 --> 03:25:35,866
The word we got is we're waiting for them to draft something that we would approve.

2638
03:25:36,546 --> 03:25:42,688
So we're waiting on the city solicitor, I believe, so we can do that.

2639
03:25:42,968 --> 03:25:44,408
And I appreciate that, Councilor Skoufis.

2640
03:25:45,021 --> 03:25:52,547
The way I presented it was that we were gonna have this be an administrative policy, so a policy that falls under the Board of Health.

2641
03:25:53,367 --> 03:25:57,651
Not everything needs to be enacted by legislation, right?

2642
03:25:58,291 --> 03:26:05,276
So that would be an administrative policy, but I think it would go a long way allowing the city to act and intervene on behalf of residents.

2643
03:26:05,296 --> 03:26:06,957
So I appreciate that comment.

2644
03:26:06,977 --> 03:26:14,463
So the road in control, Madam Mayor, just so you know, if there's money that can be moved around, we need to bait our catch basins,

2645
03:26:14,907 --> 03:26:16,068
We need to do a better job.

2646
03:26:16,088 --> 03:26:19,471
I can tell you the Wellington area is crawling with rats.

2647
03:26:19,851 --> 03:26:20,632
It really is.

2648
03:26:21,352 --> 03:26:26,356
And I've heard the same from the Heights and part of South Method and even in the Haines Square area.

2649
03:26:26,376 --> 03:26:28,778
So there's a problem throughout the community.

2650
03:26:29,158 --> 03:26:31,941
And I think we really need to address it.

2651
03:26:33,102 --> 03:26:39,207
The other issue I had, Mr. President, and I appreciate it was the planting of new trees.

2652
03:26:39,227 --> 03:26:43,430
The administration decided to put 15,000, which I appreciate.

2653
03:26:44,552 --> 03:26:57,239
I appreciate also the 25,000 added for stump removal, but I can just tell you in the 500 odd stumps that are throughout the community, that will tend to just a small, small percentage.

2654
03:26:57,639 --> 03:27:04,742
Because it's not just the grinding of stumps, it is the adding of new sidewalks, concrete, and everything else associated with it.

2655
03:27:05,362 --> 03:27:12,406
And I don't think we're gonna get nearly close to getting level with these stumps.

2656
03:27:13,247 --> 03:27:14,468
if we don't put more money into it.

2657
03:27:14,508 --> 03:27:19,252
So that I want to bring up, Mr. President, I don't think there's enough money for stump removal.

2658
03:27:19,772 --> 03:27:23,315
And definitely, Mr. President, the repaving and repairing of our streets.

2659
03:27:23,775 --> 03:27:27,698
Chapter 90 money, we put about $980,000 a year from the state.

2660
03:27:28,318 --> 03:27:31,020
That is through Chapter 90 money.

2661
03:27:31,120 --> 03:27:38,946
The mayor's capital plan calls for, and correct me if I'm wrong, 13 new streets being paved over a six year period.

2662
03:27:39,386 --> 03:27:41,068
We have 719 odd streets in our community.

2663
03:27:43,688 --> 03:27:48,449
13 over six years, we will never get ahead of the game if that's the game plan.

2664
03:27:48,869 --> 03:27:54,470
And that would be the avenue through a capital plan to address some of the major concerns.

2665
03:27:55,310 --> 03:27:57,431
There is little to no money.

2666
03:27:58,511 --> 03:28:06,653
I think I can state that there is zero money to repave in the budget and maybe some small money to fill potholes and so forth.

2667
03:28:07,113 --> 03:28:12,794
So I don't think we're aggressive enough in tackling one of the major issues we all hear,

2668
03:28:13,230 --> 03:28:14,810
is the poor condition, and you hear it.

2669
03:28:15,090 --> 03:28:18,011
And these conditions, this is not a target at anyone.

2670
03:28:18,031 --> 03:28:28,114
These conditions have existed for 20, 30 years in our community, but we have to have a systematic way of addressing it, and I don't think we're quite there yet, so.

2671
03:28:29,114 --> 03:28:30,814
Just on that, no, I agree with you.

2672
03:28:31,034 --> 03:28:37,376
The million or so dollars we get for Chapter 90 does not go nearly as far as we need it to.

2673
03:28:37,396 --> 03:28:40,857
The good news is is that ARPA funding is gonna be

2674
03:28:41,388 --> 03:28:44,670
we can use it for water and sewer infrastructure, so we have to create a plan.

2675
03:28:45,090 --> 03:28:56,395
And the question, Director Benley-Benjamin has been on calls too, where we've asked if we do the water and sewer infrastructure, can we also repave the road with that money and do the sidewalks?

2676
03:28:56,515 --> 03:29:02,478
And we're still, I think, waiting on guidance unless a director knows something that has been updated.

2677
03:29:02,558 --> 03:29:08,681
So we're really hoping we can work together on the worst pipes underground, water and sewer, and our worst streets.

2678
03:29:09,134 --> 03:29:11,416
and get more repaved and create a plan to do so.

2679
03:29:11,516 --> 03:29:12,697
So I hear you loud and clear.

2680
03:29:13,077 --> 03:29:20,963
We've not maintained them for the last 40 years and there's 716 streets we need to get done.

2681
03:29:21,584 --> 03:29:24,006
But we do have the assessment that is being finalized.

2682
03:29:24,066 --> 03:29:25,407
So we will get everybody a copy.

2683
03:29:26,047 --> 03:29:27,969
Our streets and sidewalks were assessed.

2684
03:29:28,009 --> 03:29:30,171
That was about a year project that took about a year.

2685
03:29:30,191 --> 03:29:35,134
And that will be forwarded to you as soon as we have a final product, hopefully sometime in July.

2686
03:29:35,154 --> 03:29:37,857
And I appreciate that.

2687
03:29:39,073 --> 03:29:49,278
And just, you know, putting forth some of the highlights, the election coordinator position, originally in the budget, it was only for a part-time position, Mr. President.

2688
03:29:49,679 --> 03:29:55,982
I think behind this rail, we all can appreciate the importance of having a full-time election coordinator.

2689
03:29:56,322 --> 03:30:03,385
Every year we have a major election in this city, and the integrity of our election has to be at the top of the priority list.

2690
03:30:03,766 --> 03:30:08,368
Without the confidence in our election process and how we hire our elected officials,

2691
03:30:08,767 --> 03:30:17,473
and how we look at the city charter, which governs how we operate as a community, I think, you know, you couldn't have the confidence and trust in a community.

2692
03:30:17,754 --> 03:30:19,035
So that's a vital role.

2693
03:30:19,295 --> 03:30:28,822
I'm happy to see that the mayor saw fit to extend that from a part-time position at the request of this council to a full-time position, Mr. President.

2694
03:30:29,482 --> 03:30:30,703
The staff does a great work.

2695
03:30:30,983 --> 03:30:35,907
The people that are currently in their roles, in my opinion, do a great work, Mr. President.

2696
03:30:36,350 --> 03:30:38,792
And we're at 41,000 registered voters now.

2697
03:30:39,392 --> 03:30:41,934
That number has increased over the years dramatically.

2698
03:30:42,395 --> 03:30:46,638
So we have more registered voters in this community.

2699
03:30:46,878 --> 03:30:49,680
We have more options and ways of people voting.

2700
03:30:50,060 --> 03:30:51,201
We have extended voting.

2701
03:30:51,261 --> 03:30:52,982
We have absentee ballots.

2702
03:30:53,022 --> 03:30:54,544
We have early voting.

2703
03:30:54,904 --> 03:30:57,065
We have a lot going on now, Mr. President.

2704
03:30:57,366 --> 03:30:59,487
And we want to maintain the integrity of that office.

2705
03:30:59,947 --> 03:31:04,010
The city clerk does a great job, but he's one person and he wears many hats.

2706
03:31:04,071 --> 03:31:05,932
And this coordinator position,

2707
03:31:06,435 --> 03:31:09,919
It's worth its weight in gold and I appreciate the mayor saw fit to do that.

2708
03:31:10,519 --> 03:31:15,605
Uh, the director of parking is going to be a vital role as the president and the facilities manager.

2709
03:31:16,025 --> 03:31:23,353
I know this council has called for it in particular council Scott Pelley has been talking about a road crew for sidewalks and streets, but in particular,

2710
03:31:23,780 --> 03:31:26,322
facilities manager for the last several years.

2711
03:31:26,842 --> 03:31:37,548
And finally, we're seeing that position in the budget, which will draw light to every building in this community, that there's a maintenance plan, there's someone overseeing it.

2712
03:31:38,569 --> 03:31:53,418
And I think, again, it's going to pay in the long run, because we're not going to be throwing money into buildings that with proper maintenance, we're not going to see all this need for additional work later down.

2713
03:31:53,851 --> 03:31:57,572
So it'll end up being a cost savings in the long run, Mr. President.

2714
03:31:59,073 --> 03:32:00,053
I'm going to stop for now.

2715
03:32:00,073 --> 03:32:01,234
There was a number of other things.

2716
03:32:02,234 --> 03:32:08,897
Mr. President, you're giving me the hairy eye.

2717
03:32:13,438 --> 03:32:16,740
And I appreciate my colleagues, but this is important.

2718
03:32:16,840 --> 03:32:18,420
It's $191 million budget.

2719
03:32:18,500 --> 03:32:22,742
I just want to make sure that at least all my concerns and my colleagues are addressed.

2720
03:32:23,106 --> 03:32:25,467
Thank you, Mr. President.

2721
03:32:25,507 --> 03:32:26,167
Thank you, Mr. President.

2722
03:32:26,187 --> 03:32:29,228
I appreciate all my colleagues adding so much input.

2723
03:32:29,248 --> 03:32:31,569
I think that just a couple of quick questions.

2724
03:32:32,250 --> 03:32:35,171
Madam Mayor, the parking enforcement, is that an enterprise account?

2725
03:32:35,871 --> 03:32:38,472
Would that be under an enterprise account or it's going to be through the city budget?

2726
03:32:38,512 --> 03:32:42,374
I could ask Director Nunley-Benjamin, she's, yeah, the expert.

2727
03:32:43,914 --> 03:32:48,236
Hi, so the parking enforcement account in the future is probably going to become a revolving fund.

2728
03:32:48,996 --> 03:32:49,257
Okay.

2729
03:32:49,437 --> 03:32:49,697
Thank you.

2730
03:32:49,717 --> 03:32:50,337
All right, thank you.

2731
03:32:50,964 --> 03:33:00,730
Um, and I think that I don't want to be redundant, but, uh, first of all, uh, uh, Alicia, um, I can't thank you for your, uh, professionalism.

2732
03:33:00,951 --> 03:33:10,317
I know that we've had you up every single day and we leave this council and you go back and have to do all that work that we're, we're giving you.

2733
03:33:10,377 --> 03:33:18,562
So I appreciate you coming back and making sure that we're given the proper information so we can present a responsible, uh, uh,

2734
03:33:19,182 --> 03:33:25,723
content to the mayor and the city administration so we can make our city function the way we hope it would.

2735
03:33:25,783 --> 03:33:27,404
So thank you so much for that.

2736
03:33:28,384 --> 03:33:41,587
But again, I will echo that every question I had, Madam Mayor, with the budget, I wasn't asking for, in essence, the city to find funding.

2737
03:33:42,007 --> 03:33:43,427
I think that I gave creative

2738
03:33:44,194 --> 03:33:49,318
uh, input and in hoping we could get to some resolve as we move forward down the line.

2739
03:33:49,599 --> 03:33:52,261
And I, you know, you were on the council with us, you sat next to me.

2740
03:33:52,281 --> 03:34:01,188
And one of the biggest things that I've been pushing for is the DPW, uh, adding three person sidewalk and, uh, hot top crew.

2741
03:34:01,689 --> 03:34:06,853
I got the information back and I understand that that's not something that, uh, we're going to be looking into.

2742
03:34:06,913 --> 03:34:12,778
I know the process of adding five more people, which is, which is important, but we all know that

2743
03:34:13,171 --> 03:34:15,093
you know, each department needs at least three more.

2744
03:34:15,173 --> 03:34:30,506
So I guess it's a start, but you know, I would really look, look at as the process moves on and really focusing on instead of budgeting or bonding out 250 or $500,000 a year, really look at the cost savings.

2745
03:34:30,566 --> 03:34:37,693
If we kept this in house and what those other three people can do, uh, with that DPW director and, uh, and movement and movement.

2746
03:34:37,733 --> 03:34:40,135
So, uh, the second thing I'm glad to, uh,

2747
03:34:40,536 --> 03:34:43,298
I got a response back from the recreation department.

2748
03:34:43,839 --> 03:35:05,576
One of the initiatives I brought forward was the reevaluating the process of scheduling and booking field times and looking to see where those monies can be filtered right back to the recreation department, to the parks department to assist in refurbishing some fields, changing fencing.

2749
03:35:06,057 --> 03:35:09,840
So it's taking the money that we're generating and bringing it back to our

2750
03:35:10,633 --> 03:35:11,213
our community.

2751
03:35:11,774 --> 03:35:27,204
And I'm, I'm glad to say I got, I got a, I received an email today that it looks like there's going to be some movement and there'll be, there'll be holding a meeting, uh, that they requested that, uh, that hopefully I can be part of and get, try to help that ball get moving that.

2752
03:35:27,544 --> 03:35:40,073
But I think the biggest thing we talked about, we had a very trying year this year and, uh, one of the biggest things, and especially for myself, I think that, um, you know, I felt it and I listened and, um, was the,

2753
03:35:40,654 --> 03:35:42,134
social issues we had in our community.

2754
03:35:42,715 --> 03:35:49,697
And one of the things we talked about at the round table discussions was making sure we put our money where our mouth is and move forward with some initiatives.

2755
03:35:50,037 --> 03:36:10,343
And I think that's why this council really stood strong and understand that really having the diversity directors stand alone, so that person can have the freedom to work with, you know, like I said, I'd love to see as we move forward with the school budget, bringing in an assistant on the school side and having those two people work together

2756
03:36:10,790 --> 03:36:22,013
and start their own office with the administrative assistant and really getting to see what we wanna see for growth and diversity in our community.

2757
03:36:22,554 --> 03:36:31,516
Because I know that it's not just on the police force, not just in the classroom, but it's also what our kids are talking about every day and what they're hearing every day.

2758
03:36:31,556 --> 03:36:40,139
And a lot of times you learn from our children and I have two at home and you have to listen to them, you listen to their friends,

2759
03:36:40,672 --> 03:36:46,475
I think there's a disconnect in the schools where there really isn't a true identity that they can reach.

2760
03:36:48,396 --> 03:36:51,817
So we have right now this position, I really appreciate this.

2761
03:36:51,857 --> 03:37:02,563
This is a great, this is one of the reasons why I'm in favor of the budget because I think this was probably my number one wants in my non-negotiable.

2762
03:37:03,143 --> 03:37:07,465
And I appreciate you and the administration looking into that and making this come to fruition.

2763
03:37:07,505 --> 03:37:08,765
So like I said,

2764
03:37:10,433 --> 03:37:25,409
Councils have asked some great questions and we've debated some great issues, but all of my questions were asked and I yield to my fellow colleagues as we proceed, so thank you.

2765
03:37:27,345 --> 03:37:30,946
Thank you, Mr. President, and I wanna thank the mayor for being here tonight.

2766
03:37:30,986 --> 03:37:37,647
I think your presence has gone a long way in just helping us get those final questions answered and really hammer through some stuff, and I appreciate that.

2767
03:37:37,687 --> 03:37:52,791
And I also appreciate the responses from the administration, really over the past day or so, helping to respond to some council calls, particularly for me, around the diversity director, bumping up that salary and the money for trees as well.

2768
03:37:54,230 --> 03:37:55,670
you know, I think the administration for that.

2769
03:37:55,750 --> 03:38:04,633
And I think just highlighting the fact that, you know, it's not about the council, it's about, you know, just our request to support city services and the essential staff that make it possible.

2770
03:38:05,373 --> 03:38:06,073
So I thank you for that.

2771
03:38:06,113 --> 03:38:22,457
And also the essential staff, but I also wanna echo Councilor Scarpelli and thank Alicia for being with us for countless, countless hours and really answering all of our questions and answering them so fast and so thoroughly in a way that enables us to do our job, even if it takes us 30 hours of meetings.

2772
03:38:23,532 --> 03:38:25,153
So I'm in favor of this budget.

2773
03:38:25,653 --> 03:38:28,815
It's not a perfect document, but nothing is.

2774
03:38:28,875 --> 03:38:31,977
I think it was, a lot of it was negotiated in good faith.

2775
03:38:32,017 --> 03:38:35,879
And I believe the administration heard us last year and this year.

2776
03:38:36,480 --> 03:38:38,421
So I hope it passes.

2777
03:38:38,781 --> 03:38:39,141
Thank you.

2778
03:38:43,444 --> 03:38:44,424
Thank you, Mr. President.

2779
03:38:44,684 --> 03:38:50,868
I definitely share some of the concerns that my colleagues have mentioned previously with regard to the caps.

2780
03:38:52,006 --> 03:38:56,827
And street repaving, parking, I definitely have concerns there.

2781
03:38:56,847 --> 03:39:05,009
I think Councilor Marks hit it on the head with regards to the budget and how it's, in the future, it's gonna definitely need to be bigger than what it is.

2782
03:39:05,929 --> 03:39:12,031
Because, you know, the parking program to handle this size city, you're gonna need collectors, you'll need maintenance, you'll need hearings.

2783
03:39:12,051 --> 03:39:14,632
So that needs to be thought of in the future.

2784
03:39:15,012 --> 03:39:16,752
Definitely some concerns.

2785
03:39:16,792 --> 03:39:20,133
And I remember asking Marianne O'Connor about this regarding

2786
03:39:21,275 --> 03:39:23,556
rodents and rodent infestation.

2787
03:39:23,576 --> 03:39:26,376
That there is a big concern to me.

2788
03:39:26,416 --> 03:39:28,317
It's budgeted $13,000.

2789
03:39:28,777 --> 03:39:32,478
And then she was talking about stores that were being baited.

2790
03:39:32,538 --> 03:39:34,098
I think it was in the George Street area.

2791
03:39:35,138 --> 03:39:37,619
Just that project alone is gonna cost, I think, 6,000.

2792
03:39:37,779 --> 03:39:39,499
That's half the budget for the year.

2793
03:39:39,559 --> 03:39:49,902
So to me, if there's ever extra money, I think that really needs to be addressed because no matter where you go in the city, Wellington, the Heights,

2794
03:39:50,771 --> 03:40:06,482
South Medford, you know, I know I get the complaints and the calls with regards to rodents and it's quality of life issue needs to be addressed and we need to make sure that we're safeguarding the residents when it comes to rodents and mice and that type of thing.

2795
03:40:08,884 --> 03:40:11,686
Street and stumps, always concerned about that.

2796
03:40:11,946 --> 03:40:13,347
I'd like to see more of a plan.

2797
03:40:15,210 --> 03:40:19,532
Information technology, that came up during our budget hearings when we talked to Mike Ferretti.

2798
03:40:19,913 --> 03:40:22,414
And I definitely have some concerns with regards to that.

2799
03:40:22,494 --> 03:40:27,377
I think to guide specifically to the training, because it sounds like there's really no professional development.

2800
03:40:27,657 --> 03:40:29,738
He mentioned he's paying for his own professional development.

2801
03:40:30,218 --> 03:40:41,044
I think in this day and age with regards to, you hear about ransom attacks and all that, that really needs to be addressed throughout City Hall.

2802
03:40:41,864 --> 03:40:43,445
Employees need to be trained on that.

2803
03:40:44,025 --> 03:40:45,966
and we need to see more money in that area.

2804
03:40:46,847 --> 03:40:58,635
One of my other concerns is we're hiring new staff members, which is great, but I know that there are employees within the building that did not get raises last year.

2805
03:40:59,195 --> 03:41:10,383
And that's always a concern and they worked through COVID and they came in day and night, they did all kinds of things, everything that was asked and they should be getting their increases on a timely basis.

2806
03:41:10,403 --> 03:41:12,024
So I think that that needs to be addressed.

2807
03:41:12,624 --> 03:41:13,645
I still think that,

2808
03:41:14,528 --> 03:41:16,590
The council needs a legal line item.

2809
03:41:17,390 --> 03:41:19,231
Even if it's minimal, there should be something.

2810
03:41:19,251 --> 03:41:21,713
So I think that needs to be addressed.

2811
03:41:21,733 --> 03:41:28,537
And like I said before, the employee being paid out of grade, that needs to be addressed as soon as possible.

2812
03:41:30,018 --> 03:41:33,340
It was good to see the separation of diversity and inclusion in human resources.

2813
03:41:33,400 --> 03:41:36,743
That's something I think this council has fought for for a long time.

2814
03:41:36,783 --> 03:41:37,763
So that was good to see.

2815
03:41:38,164 --> 03:41:40,045
I was happy with the decision that was made there.

2816
03:41:42,494 --> 03:41:48,099
And last but not least, I want to thank all the department heads for coming before us, answering a lot of questions.

2817
03:41:48,159 --> 03:41:49,580
And I know we had many questions.

2818
03:41:50,081 --> 03:41:51,142
And the questions were thorough.

2819
03:41:51,162 --> 03:41:51,882
Thank my colleagues.

2820
03:41:51,962 --> 03:42:03,512
I think that my colleagues here asked great questions with regard to the budget and really trying to get to the bottom of the proposed numbers with regard to salaries and expenses and whatnot.

2821
03:42:03,532 --> 03:42:08,777
I want to thank Alicia Dunlea Benjamin, who I have called repeatedly over the past month

2822
03:42:09,323 --> 03:42:11,384
for all kinds of questions regarding the budget.

2823
03:42:11,464 --> 03:42:18,669
I thank you for your patience and you did a fine job, a great job of answering all the questions and preparing this budget.

2824
03:42:18,689 --> 03:42:22,091
So I thank you for all your hard work and your dedication and commitment to the city.

2825
03:42:23,672 --> 03:42:24,993
I can't thank you enough.

2826
03:42:25,213 --> 03:42:25,513
Thank you.

2827
03:42:29,055 --> 03:42:29,455
Thank you.

2828
03:42:29,475 --> 03:42:32,277
I will do my best to keep it short and sweet.

2829
03:42:32,957 --> 03:42:36,980
I just had one final question on the elections department.

2830
03:42:37,680 --> 03:42:38,601
There is a person

2831
03:42:39,778 --> 03:42:47,643
a position currently that's different from the new position that's being created, but it's doing some of the similar work on a part-time basis.

2832
03:42:48,283 --> 03:42:55,167
I just wanna confirm that that position will continue until the new position is filled, is that correct?

2833
03:42:55,927 --> 03:43:04,252
Great, I just wanted to make sure, because I know there's a ton of work going on to make sure that with the election, with the redistricting, with everything going on, there's just a lot of work down there.

2834
03:43:04,272 --> 03:43:05,253
So that's good to hear.

2835
03:43:05,273 --> 03:43:06,913
I'm seeing a nod from the mayor, yes.

2836
03:43:07,454 --> 03:43:09,535
So just in case you can't see that on the screen.

2837
03:43:09,894 --> 03:43:10,254
Thank you.

2838
03:43:10,274 --> 03:43:18,698
I have one question, Mr. President.

2839
03:43:18,958 --> 03:43:28,723
I do believe we asked a question from the city solicitor relative to putting several other boards and commissions under the scope and purview of the Office of Community Development.

2840
03:43:29,403 --> 03:43:32,365
Our Office of Community Development was established by the acts in 1974, chapter 839.

2841
03:43:32,465 --> 03:43:34,065
And we discussed that during the budget hearing.

2842
03:43:38,199 --> 03:43:45,943
made a request to the city solicitor as to whether or not this administration, not this administration, but the community is acting in accordance with the general law.

2843
03:43:46,123 --> 03:43:51,965
When we adopted that local option, it said that any type of order commission that falls under that office has to be voted on.

2844
03:43:52,125 --> 03:43:54,647
So I was wondering if we haven't received a response from the solicitor on that.

2845
03:43:58,548 --> 03:43:58,828
Thank you.

2846
03:44:00,929 --> 03:44:04,051
Mr. President, can I ask one last question?

2847
03:44:04,071 --> 03:44:06,712
As far as the, so as far as the setup for the

2848
03:44:09,375 --> 03:44:15,099
Diversity and Inclusion Office and the Human Resources.

2849
03:44:16,900 --> 03:44:20,782
Madam Mayor, could you or Alicia just explain the set up.

2850
03:44:21,082 --> 03:44:25,585
So we have the new role of, I just wanna make sure I have this straight, because then I'll be asked.

2851
03:44:25,805 --> 03:44:27,567
So you have the new.

2852
03:44:31,969 --> 03:44:35,051
And while you're looking at the- The Chief People Officer is at the top.

2853
03:44:35,151 --> 03:44:36,332
Chief People Officer.

2854
03:44:36,512 --> 03:44:37,733
Is that the only person in the department?

2855
03:44:39,497 --> 03:44:46,760
Candace Carter is the benefits coordinator.

2856
03:44:46,940 --> 03:44:47,200
Okay.

2857
03:44:47,720 --> 03:44:47,900
Yes.

2858
03:44:48,181 --> 03:44:49,601
So that'll be a two person department.

2859
03:44:50,582 --> 03:44:51,242
Human resources.

2860
03:44:51,282 --> 03:44:51,462
Yes.

2861
03:44:51,662 --> 03:44:51,922
Okay.

2862
03:44:52,242 --> 03:44:54,183
And the diversity inclusion will be.

2863
03:44:55,283 --> 03:44:57,204
We have part-time Ms.

2864
03:44:57,244 --> 03:45:04,467
Viv is part-time in that office and diversity, but she does more on the HR side.

2865
03:45:05,080 --> 03:45:10,481
And then yes, the director of diversity will be a singular office like it always was in the past.

2866
03:45:10,681 --> 03:45:12,441
So that'll be a two person office as well.

2867
03:45:13,161 --> 03:45:18,102
Well, there'll be one and human resources now is two and a half.

2868
03:45:19,162 --> 03:45:21,943
Two and a half human resources, one person in diversity.

2869
03:45:22,323 --> 03:45:22,623
Correct.

2870
03:45:23,563 --> 03:45:24,723
Thank you.

2871
03:45:25,584 --> 03:45:33,965
And with regard to the baiting, because of the ordinance that I proposed to you all, you all worked hard on that, the rat ordinance, there is a revolving account

2872
03:45:34,496 --> 03:45:36,197
Council will continually have money in it.

2873
03:45:36,658 --> 03:45:39,900
So there'll be more we'll be able to spend on that issue than 13,000.

2874
03:45:39,940 --> 03:45:41,762
So I just want to make that point.

2875
03:45:42,443 --> 03:45:44,544
And if I may, actually I know there's a motion coming.

2876
03:45:44,564 --> 03:45:55,073
I just want to thank everybody who's worked on this $191 million budget from the school committee and the school administration to the city council.

2877
03:45:56,374 --> 03:46:01,118
Obviously our director, Alicia Nunley Benjamin and Tyler Lovell and the finance team

2878
03:46:01,777 --> 03:46:09,560
It was a group effort and we value all your opinions and that's why we tried to get as many answers as we could and collaborate and make the changes.

2879
03:46:10,061 --> 03:46:12,182
So really appreciate a yes vote.

2880
03:46:12,322 --> 03:46:15,023
That's why I'm here and obviously to work with you.

2881
03:46:15,163 --> 03:46:18,824
So thank you for your time and all the hard work you put into this.

2882
03:46:18,885 --> 03:46:19,405
Appreciate it.

2883
03:46:32,641 --> 03:46:33,541
I want to thank all my colleagues.

2884
03:46:33,621 --> 03:46:35,582
It's been a long few weeks for everybody.

2885
03:46:36,622 --> 03:46:38,023
Thank you for the assistance given to me.

2886
03:46:38,983 --> 03:46:43,984
Alicia, thank you for spending all your nights with us the last couple of weeks.

2887
03:46:44,865 --> 03:46:45,765
And Tyler, thank you.

2888
03:46:46,385 --> 03:46:48,206
Madam Mayor, thank you for the budget.

2889
03:46:48,606 --> 03:46:54,187
As Councilor Morales said, there is no such thing as a proper budget, and we always want more.

2890
03:46:55,628 --> 03:46:56,628
That'll never ever change.

2891
03:46:56,648 --> 03:46:59,329
So again, I just want to thank my Councilor.

2892
03:47:01,002 --> 03:47:05,264
I just want to thank all my colleagues for the help given me over this time.

2893
03:47:05,964 --> 03:47:09,986
A lot of hours, a lot of work, and I just want to thank everybody for the help.

2894
03:47:10,686 --> 03:47:13,247
And I think it was a good group effort by everybody.

2895
03:47:13,687 --> 03:47:14,988
So we have a motion.

2896
03:47:15,088 --> 03:47:16,288
We have a motion on the floor.

2897
03:47:16,328 --> 03:47:24,151
Mr. President, if I may, before we take a vote, I just wanted to disclose that I have a son that's a lifeguard in the recreation department.

2898
03:47:24,331 --> 03:47:27,152
So I just wanted to let you know that.

2899
03:47:30,447 --> 03:47:36,190
So I too have, my sister works in the school department as a reading specialist.

2900
03:47:36,210 --> 03:47:37,991
So just wanted to disclose that.

2901
03:47:38,011 --> 03:47:38,991
Okay.

2902
03:47:39,471 --> 03:47:40,852
Motion to approve, Mr. President.

2903
03:47:41,232 --> 03:47:48,996
On the motion to approve the budget by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Morrell.

2904
03:47:50,196 --> 03:47:52,157
And the total budget will be $191,935,935.6.

2905
03:48:01,914 --> 03:48:05,717
minus the minus $55,000.

2906
03:48:06,517 --> 03:48:13,382
Mr. President, if I may, before I vote, I am in full agreement.

2907
03:48:13,943 --> 03:48:15,184
I think it's a good school budget.

2908
03:48:15,464 --> 03:48:17,385
I like the school budget a lot.

2909
03:48:17,665 --> 03:48:28,553
I have some disagreements throughout the rest of the budget, but I definitely like the school budget, but I would be voting against the budget because the other issues that I had mentioned previously.

2910
03:48:29,654 --> 03:48:31,735
Thank you.

2911
03:48:32,755 --> 03:48:33,015
Okay.

2912
03:48:33,075 --> 03:48:44,418
So if I may, Mr. President, I too find many positives in this budget and I do have some very, very loud concerns that I've made very vocal this evening.

2913
03:48:45,779 --> 03:48:48,760
Ultimately, Mr. President, this isn't an issue about personalities.

2914
03:48:48,780 --> 03:48:52,961
It's an issue about moving the city of Medford forward, what direction we want to go in.

2915
03:48:54,338 --> 03:49:00,742
I, for one, have spent a lot of time and energy and effort this year focusing on being financially accountable and fiscally transparent.

2916
03:49:01,983 --> 03:49:06,525
And I don't think I'll be able to support the budget this evening because of that $620,000 appropriation that's in there.

2917
03:49:06,625 --> 03:49:08,447
It's not here for anything.

2918
03:49:09,827 --> 03:49:12,949
I also have some concerns about the investment that we're making in our highway department.

2919
03:49:13,129 --> 03:49:17,852
We only have 16 members of our highway department, up zero from last year.

2920
03:49:18,960 --> 03:49:29,007
So these are some concerns I think that, you know, when we talk about what we need to do to provide for our community and show that our tax dollars are going to the delivery of services, we need to invest in certain areas, Mr. President.

2921
03:49:29,327 --> 03:49:34,691
I feel as though we're moving away from some of the areas that are necessary and being invested in, very basic areas.

2922
03:49:35,372 --> 03:49:38,153
So with that being said, I will not be supporting this paper this evening.

2923
03:49:38,294 --> 03:49:39,454
I do agree with Councilman Chalko.

2924
03:49:39,474 --> 03:49:44,018
I think that the school budget increases are something that are very positive in this community.

2925
03:49:45,625 --> 03:49:47,587
I do believe there are very good things in this budget.

2926
03:49:47,607 --> 03:49:58,197
There are some very good things in this budget, Mr. President, but I can't, in my right mind as a fiscal steward in this community, appropriate, you know, close to $620,000 for funds that I don't know where that would go.

2927
03:49:58,217 --> 03:50:08,386
So with that being said, we will take the, hopefully the mayor will keep her word on that and we will get that on the July meeting.

2928
03:50:08,566 --> 03:50:09,647
That Mr. President, coupled with

2929
03:50:11,536 --> 03:50:15,479
Council priority is being, you know, having a line item for legal counsel.

2930
03:50:16,560 --> 03:50:22,844
I think it's very important for us, you know, moving forward and being able to address the concerns that are brought to us and presented to us.

2931
03:50:23,444 --> 03:50:26,667
So with that being said, Mr. President, for those reasons, I will be voting against the budget this week.

2932
03:50:27,427 --> 03:50:35,493
And I will work with the mayor to develop some type of plan before the next meeting for the legal.

2933
03:50:37,434 --> 03:50:38,515
So on the motion by,

2934
03:50:39,275 --> 03:50:39,855
Councilor Behrs.

2935
03:50:40,135 --> 03:50:42,116
I just want to make a motion to approve as amended.

2936
03:50:44,316 --> 03:50:49,678
On the motion to approve as amended by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Councilor Morrell.

2937
03:50:50,338 --> 03:50:51,578
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2938
03:50:52,278 --> 03:50:52,838
Councilor Behrs.

2939
03:50:53,218 --> 03:50:53,498
Yes.

2940
03:50:55,019 --> 03:50:55,659
Councilor Tocco.

2941
03:50:57,639 --> 03:50:58,320
Vice President Knight.

2942
03:50:58,420 --> 03:50:58,640
No.

2943
03:51:00,460 --> 03:51:01,040
Councilor Marks.

2944
03:51:01,340 --> 03:51:01,620
Yes.

2945
03:51:03,761 --> 03:51:04,341
Councilor Morrell.

2946
03:51:04,581 --> 03:51:04,861
Yes.

2947
03:51:06,702 --> 03:51:07,422
Councilor Scarpelli.

2948
03:51:07,642 --> 03:51:07,822
Yes.

2949
03:51:09,256 --> 03:51:10,016
President Kerr, are we all?

2950
03:51:10,256 --> 03:51:14,658
Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative, motion passes.

2951
03:51:15,598 --> 03:51:17,859
Again, thank you everybody for the help.

2952
03:51:17,939 --> 03:51:18,719
Madam Mayor, thank you.

2953
03:51:20,960 --> 03:51:23,121
We still have a couple more things before we finish.

2954
03:51:24,001 --> 03:51:33,825
Reports of committees, 21403, which was the budget, which has now been passed, motion to approve.

2955
03:51:36,041 --> 03:51:38,362
Motion by Councilor Behr, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2956
03:51:38,403 --> 03:51:40,044
All those in favor?

2957
03:51:40,424 --> 03:51:41,164
Motion passes.

2958
03:51:43,826 --> 03:51:44,226
Records.

2959
03:51:46,968 --> 03:51:47,309
Records.

2960
03:51:49,670 --> 03:51:51,471
That's the only one that I see.

2961
03:51:51,531 --> 03:51:54,053
Am I missing one?

2962
03:51:54,453 --> 03:51:56,295
Which committee reporting missing, Councilor?

2963
03:52:00,878 --> 03:52:01,698
For which one, Councilor?

2964
03:52:06,583 --> 03:52:08,223
Yeah, did I not?

2965
03:52:08,243 --> 03:52:09,764
Are those not in there?

2966
03:52:10,944 --> 03:52:12,865
I believe I emailed those last week.

2967
03:52:15,926 --> 03:52:16,966
Did we just approve all those?

2968
03:52:17,046 --> 03:52:18,506
23rd, 24th, 26th.

2969
03:52:18,766 --> 03:52:20,667
That one just got approved.

2970
03:52:20,867 --> 03:52:22,588
I think you just voted to approve that one.

2971
03:52:22,608 --> 03:52:23,388
Just one, right?

2972
03:52:23,428 --> 03:52:25,288
There's three different committee reports, am I correct?

2973
03:52:25,508 --> 03:52:27,229
I only see one here.

2974
03:52:27,969 --> 03:52:29,009
Yes, June 23rd, June 24th, June 26th.

2975
03:52:29,049 --> 03:52:30,590
Can you elaborate on what those were for?

2976
03:52:35,055 --> 03:52:37,056
Those were all a bunch of meetings, am I correct, Mr. Clerk?

2977
03:52:37,256 --> 03:52:38,417
Those were all a bunch of meetings.

2978
03:52:38,577 --> 03:52:39,237
All a bunch of meetings.

2979
03:52:39,377 --> 03:52:42,419
Then what about the meetings with regard to the special sessions that we had?

2980
03:52:42,739 --> 03:52:46,901
Those are separate council records, Councilor.

2981
03:52:46,921 --> 03:52:52,004
There's council records from last week, and there's council records from last week's emergency meeting.

2982
03:52:52,804 --> 03:52:54,425
So those aren't ready yet?

2983
03:52:55,045 --> 03:52:56,846
No, I emailed those as well.

2984
03:52:57,226 --> 03:53:04,190
The only one I have, the records from Friday night are not,

2985
03:53:04,862 --> 03:53:12,547
are not on the agenda tonight, but the records from last Tuesday's council meeting and last Wednesday's emergency meeting, I emailed to you.

2986
03:53:13,048 --> 03:53:20,152
So with regard to those, are they going to be voted on?

2987
03:53:20,693 --> 03:53:23,595
They've been emailed, but are they on the agenda?

2988
03:53:23,615 --> 03:53:24,575
They're not on the agenda?

2989
03:53:24,595 --> 03:53:30,820
To answer your question, if you look under the records entry on the agenda tonight, it's got the two sets of records broken up into different

2990
03:53:34,826 --> 03:53:37,907
days.

2991
03:53:37,927 --> 03:53:38,888
There's two.

2992
03:53:38,948 --> 03:53:42,649
I believe one set went to Councilor Morrell and one set went to Councilor Scapelli.

2993
03:53:42,789 --> 03:53:45,170
Yes, there's two of them that we will read next.

2994
03:53:45,670 --> 03:53:45,910
Okay.

2995
03:53:48,751 --> 03:53:57,215
The records of the emergency meeting of June 23, 2021 were passed to Councilor Scapelli.

2996
03:53:57,775 --> 03:54:00,296
Councilor Scapelli, how did you find those records?

2997
03:54:06,327 --> 03:54:16,892
So if I may, on the records for the emergency meeting, are we taking any further action or is it just dying?

2998
03:54:17,032 --> 03:54:22,894
If the council would like to take action, that would be the chair with the motion.

2999
03:54:25,335 --> 03:54:31,038
May I be so bold as to suggest Mr. President, whereas it seems as though we have a commitment to be able to

3000
03:54:32,248 --> 03:54:42,652
possibly retain our own legal counsel going forward with this commitment to the administration, maybe we let the item lay on the table and we move forward discussing our options with our own legal counsel, should that be necessary?

3001
03:54:43,732 --> 03:54:44,712
If I may, Mr. President.

3002
03:54:45,813 --> 03:54:46,873
I don't disagree with that.

3003
03:54:47,033 --> 03:54:58,797
I believe the records before us are the Tuesday meeting we had, not the Friday evening meeting we had, which those records would come up

3004
03:55:00,365 --> 03:55:01,125
at our July meeting?

3005
03:55:01,145 --> 03:55:07,126
The Friday evening meeting records, I finished about an hour before this meeting started.

3006
03:55:07,446 --> 03:55:09,647
So they are not on the agenda tonight.

3007
03:55:09,667 --> 03:55:11,687
I approve Tuesday's meetings.

3008
03:55:11,727 --> 03:55:12,747
I believe it was Wednesday.

3009
03:55:14,047 --> 03:55:15,488
23rd.

3010
03:55:15,568 --> 03:55:18,088
I believe it was Wednesday the 23rd.

3011
03:55:18,268 --> 03:55:20,808
So Friday is the one in question.

3012
03:55:20,888 --> 03:55:23,769
Friday has not made the agenda yet.

3013
03:55:24,029 --> 03:55:25,669
Right, so we can still take further action.

3014
03:55:25,689 --> 03:55:27,010
