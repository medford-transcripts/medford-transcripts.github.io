    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=0.993s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3.313s">26th</a>  regular meeting of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6.134s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7.514s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8.054s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8.814s">Councilor</a>  Thompson. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9.555s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10.135s">Vice</a>  President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10.815s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11.235s">Councilor</a>  Martins. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12.055s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12.655s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=13.495s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14.075s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14.855s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=15.296s">President</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=16.936s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=17.756s">Please</a>  rise and assume the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=19.236s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=31.675s">Before</a>  we start the meeting tonight, tonight's the last night for our TV station manager, Pat Gordon. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=43.519s">And</a>  Pat, we just want to thank you for your service for all the years and the time it's ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=49.861s">So</a>  congratulations and good luck on your new position. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=55.482s">Councilor</a>  Marksley, do you want to?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=56.883s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=57.844s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=60.246s">Patrick</a>  Gordon has been an instrumental part of this team since he came on with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=66.892s">And</a>  in particular, Mr. President, over the 18 or so months of the pandemic, Patrick was the one that brought us into the 21st century, allowing us to communicate with our constituents that were unable to attend meetings during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=82.88s">And</a>  he was instrumental in bringing up Zoom for us, not only for the council meeting, but many other public meetings in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=90.904s">And</a>  I credit him, actually, for having us keep open government during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=98.447s">And</a>  I wish him well in his new endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=101.088s">And</a>  hopefully, at some point, we'll see him again, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=105.955s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=107.436s">I</a>  mean, I'm scared to say nice things because I don't want to see you go, but yeah, to echo Councilor Marks, just the work you always do is tremendous, but the work you did, particularly during the pandemic to get us dialed in from home in the chambers, allowing the public to engage, you know, doing that with your own equipment and really kind of bootstrapping to get this a really successful system, I think speaks volumes to just how you operate and have operated since you've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=129.489s">So</a>  you will be sorely missed and I thank you for your years of just excellent service to the city and to the council.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=136.306s">Councilor</a>  Tocco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=137.346s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=138.307s">Thank</a>  you so much for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=140.987s">Last</a>  year when I was president, we were going through this together and I called you on a regular basis just to make sure that all the technology was working fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=149.95s">And</a>  we made that transition from Zoom back into the council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=155.632s">You</a>  were instrumental, be humble, leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=158.493s">I</a>  know it took you many hours to test everything out and to get it working. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=163.652s">it</a>  was, it was seamless. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=164.733s">We</a>  came back, you had everything going, everything working absolutely to perfection. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=169.795s">And</a>  I can't thank you enough for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=171.555s">And</a>  for all of the hours that you've put in in the past year, year and a half, I know you've been working nonstop, not just with our meetings, but with all of the municipal meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=181.279s">So</a>  thank you so much for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=183.7s">Congratulations,</a>  good luck, best wishes, and thank you for all your hard work.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=188.262s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=190.724s">Pat,</a>  I'm going to be very sad to see you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=192.465s">We've</a>  had a lot of laughs over the past couple of years, and I'm very grateful that you came and took over TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=200.61s">It's</a>  been quite a run for you, brother. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=202.071s">You've</a>  put in a ton of hours, overworked and underpaid, and I'm very sad to see you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=206.114s">You've</a>  done an excellent job for us here at MedFed, and you've really helped bring us to the 21st century, so thank you very much for all you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=211.697s">I</a>  wish you the best of luck over in Everett, and I hope you don't recommend them to steal anybody else from us over here.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=219.018s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=220.039s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President and Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=222.621s">I</a>  mean, I don't think we can say enough about how far above and beyond you've gone in your entire service, you know, running community media for an entire community by yourself, you know, up until just a few months ago, I think, and what you've done for us in the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=237.774s">And</a>  personally, I can't thank you enough for making me look good on camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=241.977s">So</a>  I really look forward to seeing what you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=245.642s">and</a>  hopefully building a budget that could attract someone like you back here in the future.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=251.584s">Uh,</a>  Pat, uh, this is, uh, it's bittersweet because, uh, you know, you went through a tough time with all of us and, uh, it was your leadership that pulled us through. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=262.488s">So</a>  I don't think people realize how much you did do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=265.649s">Um,</a>  I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=267.334s">when</a>  you're talking about a position where it takes you away from your family, you, you know, you, you see some people get bitter and angry. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=274.741s">I've</a>  never, ever saw that in you at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=277.183s">Um,</a>  I'd see you on a Tuesday after a marathon session, the school committee, and then thinking that we have a marathon session on Tuesday and thinking your week's done, but no, you have to do another committee meeting on a Wednesday and you're a one man team. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=291.136s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=292.677s">No</a>  wonder why other communities came in and tried to scoop you up and why you're leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=297.2s">So</a>  it hurts that you are leaving, but, you know, you took a lot of junk from a lot of ignorant people that you had to deal with and listen to that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=308.189s">But</a>  I just warned you, yeah, we had the flyby, it was supposed to start, and then the flyby. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=316.475s">So</a>  all I want to, let it be saying that, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=319.377s">Thank</a>  you, congratulations for all your hard work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=322.118s">It's</a>  something that you set Medford on a great track. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=325.838s">The</a>  award you received, I think, is something we'll never forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=330.059s">Thanks</a>  to you, and have a great time in the neighboring community.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=334.28s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=335.56s">Again,</a>  on behalf of all my colleagues and everyone at the City of Medford, thank you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=340.621s">During</a>  some tough times, you kept us together and kept the show on the road again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=344.362s">Good</a>  luck in your new position, and hopefully we can hire so many <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=348.88s">of</a>  equal talent of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=350.141s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=352.543s">Just</a>  just if I could customize on I've stated this on many occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=356.707s">The</a>  city of method charges a 5% fee on cable bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=361.685s">And</a>  that 5% fee is a franchise fee that's supposed to go to PEG access, which is public education and government channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=370.494s">Only</a>  2% of the fee goes back into providing local programs, educational programs, and government access, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=378.903s">The</a>  rest, the 3%, goes into the general office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=382.325s">And</a>  I think what we're seeing, Mr. President, this has nothing to do with Patrick, what we're seeing is a sorely underfunded PEG local access station, you know, not similar to other communities that have a large office with multiple employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=397.073s">But</a>  here we are with one employee and an assistant, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=401.882s">which</a>  just is not enough to run a peg access in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=405.484s">So</a>  I respectfully ask once again, that this be looked at by the city administration and fully fund peg access. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=414.09s">So</a>  the residents can reap the benefits, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Patrick Gordon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=416.891s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=419.133s">I</a>  want to admit that I just came tonight because I thought we were getting fed again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=424.396s">It's</a>  not a budget meeting, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=429.123s">It's</a>  been an absolute pleasure working with all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=431.486s">Um,</a>  there's obviously differences in politics and opinions, but it's quite obvious that you all have this city's best interest in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=438.513s">And</a>  it's, it's pretty clear every week seeing that, you know, work play itself out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=442.176s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=443.738s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=444.058s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=444.599s">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=444.959s">Good</a>  luck.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=445.48s">Hey,</a>  uh, vice president night.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=451.157s">A</a>  motion to suspend the rules to take several papers out of order, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=454.521s">On</a>  the motion by Vice President Knight to take papers out of order, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=458.825s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=459.927s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=460.227s">Opposed?</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=460.748s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=462.069s">Paper</a>  21431, Mr. President, a common victuals license. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=466.754s">Which</a>  one was it? 21431.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=473.522s">2-1,</a>  petitions, presentations and similar papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=477.486s">2-1-4-3-1,</a>  petition for a common fixture license for Calwind Management doing business as Town Place Suites slash Fairfield Inn Suites, 85 Station Landing, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=489.796s">Do</a>  we have anybody from Calwind Management here on the call? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=499.705s">Anybody</a>  from Calwind Management on the call? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=505.916s">Maria</a>  Costa, Marcy Costa, where are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=509.359s">Marcy</a>  Costa, as a clerk, can you unmute Marcy, please?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=519.146s">Can</a>  you all hear me?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=520.628s">Yes,</a>  Marcy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=521.428s">Are</a>  you here representing town, please?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=525.652s">I</a>  am, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=526.572s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=526.893s">Marcy</a>  Costa from McDermott, Colty, and Miller at 28 State Street in Boston, Massachusetts, on behalf of the applicant.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=533.518s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=534.651s">Licensing</a>  Chairman, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=537.313s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=538.994s">Now,</a>  this is for a petition for a conflict license at Stacey's Landing for Tower Place Suites, Fairfax. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=553.304s">Mr.</a>  President, do any of my colleagues have any comments or questions before I recommend approval?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=560.532s">Vice</a>  President, a couple things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=562.273s">First</a>  of all, Mr. President review of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=564.354s">It</a>  appears that this entity has the ability to employ over 100 full of part time employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=569.456s">So</a>  this seems like this will be something that's a great addition to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=572.878s">However,</a>  in looking at the application, the petition does seek hours from six a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=577.14s">to</a>  one a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=578.18s">And</a>  that would, I believe, require them to petition this council at a later date for an extended hours permit.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=583.443s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=587.315s">The</a>  11 o'clock would be the latest closing time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=591.178s">Under</a>  the current permit, you'd have to come back for a special permit for extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=596.882s">7</a>  to 11, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=598.303s">Yeah,</a>  the normal permit is 7 to 11.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=818.084s">One</a>  at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=819.004s">Okay,</a>  21432 to President Caraviello and all honorable members of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=822.626s">Mr.</a>  President, members of the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=824.516s">I</a>  respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body, pursuant to provisions of General Law, Chapter 40, Section 3, approve and authorize the grant of an easement to Tufts University, extending its perpetual exclusive right in, under, on, and over the easement area for the purpose of maintaining and utilizing the plaza for access to the new Cummings Center building being constructed on Tufts property <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=852.562s">for</a>  access to other parts of the Tufts campus, for a seating area, a gathering place, and for a university activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=860.403s">The</a>  easement will allow Tufts to construct a system to provide for telecommunications, distribution cables, and to serve campus needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=869.865s">For</a>  your information, I am submitting a copy of the document containing the strength of easement along with the plan setting forth the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=877.266s">Representatives</a>  from Tufts will be in attendance at the council meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=881.348s">to</a>  answer questions, especially submitted on Mayor Graham of the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=886.131s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. Abruzzi, are you here from Tufts University? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=890.754s">Mr.</a>  Clark, can you unmute Mr. Abruzzi? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=899.5s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=901.782s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=902.982s">Robert</a>  Abruzzi. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=904.755s">Attorney</a>  here on behalf of Tufts University with me is also Rocco DiRico and Ruthie Bennett from the university, the project director. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=914.299s">So</a>  we're here tonight seeking the council's approval of an easement in connection with the university's Cummings Center project on College Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=924.284s">More</a>  specifically, the grant of this easement will allow for a more aesthetically pleasing transition between the <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=934.955s">Plaza,</a>  which is in front of the coming center and the College Avenue sidewalk below. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=941.585s">As</a>  you know, there's a quite a great gradient variation in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=950.564s">The</a>  limits and the boundaries of the easement were worked out in conjunction with the university consultation with the engineering department of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=960.933s">And</a>  the easement document itself has been approved by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=967.219s">So</a>  at this point, I'll turn it over to Ruthie Bennett who will detail for the council's benefit a little bit more information about the easement request.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=977.027s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=978.827s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you could unmute Ruthie Bennett. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=985.652s">Good</a>  evening, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=986.152s">Bennett.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=986.472s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Ruthie Bennett]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=988.434s">Sure,</a>  Ruthie Bennett, Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=992.336s">Thank</a>  you very much for letting me present this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=995.118s">So</a>  first of all, of course, I've been on Zoom for 15 months, and tonight my internet is unstable, so I'm going to try to get through the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1002.883s">Is</a>  there a way that I could share my screen to show you some of the drawings? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1006.526s">Is</a>  that possible?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1007.186s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, can you yell? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1009.29s">One</a>  second, the clerk will take care of that for you.</p>

    <p>[Ruthie Bennett]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1011.791s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1013.111s">Just</a>  let me know when I should try to do that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1015.112s">Okay,</a>  Ruthie, you're all set.</p>

    <p>[Ruthie Bennett]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1021.354s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1021.974s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1024.855s">So</a>  hopefully you're seeing my screen now, which is a drawing of the building.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1029.137s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruthie Bennett]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1030.724s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1031.344s">So</a>  I just want to orient the council for a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1034.825s">So</a>  basically, this is College Avenue on the bottom of the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1039.686s">These</a>  are the MBTA tracks and Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1044.148s">And</a>  this is the Cummings building on our site. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1049.389s">This</a>  is the plaza in front of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1051.509s">This</a>  is the main entrance to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1054.262s">This</a>  is the sidewalk that we were talking about that slopes up College Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1058.623s">This</a>  is the pedestrian bridge that the MBTA has just put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1062.544s">And</a>  this is the cafe that's open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1067.745s">This</a>  is the easement, this strip of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1070.125s">It's</a>  about 1,100, 1,200 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1071.225s">You</a>  can see it's about 9 1⁄2 feet here, 7 1⁄2 feet here, and it's about 150 feet long. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1080.209s">And</a>  let me show you what the easement is in a rendering, because it's hard to understand what we're really talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1085.134s">So</a>  basically this is the Cummings building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1087.976s">And</a>  as you know, the sidewalk here slopes, it's about a five to six foot slope from the bottom over here, all the way up to the pedestrian bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1096.845s">And</a>  it was very important for us to have an accessible connection from the sidewalk to the main entrance of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1103.199s">So</a>  the plaza, of course, is flat and the sidewalk is sloping up in this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1109.306s">But</a>  right here, there is an accessible connection from the sidewalk into the main entrance of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1117.075s">In</a>  this blue area here, this is approximately, this is my rough drawing, but approximately the easement area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1124.333s">So</a>  this is the courtyard, the plaza for the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1128.035s">These</a>  are the steps going up, the flat plaza, and then steps up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1132.638s">And</a>  if we didn't have this easement, there would be a flat courtyard, flat plaza, and then there would be this drop, basically a drop from here down to six feet to get to the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1146.126s">And</a>  there would be a wall about six feet, and then going down to this accessible entrance, and then the wall would continue again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1153.858s">So</a>  in working with the engineering department, what we proposed and they thought was a good idea was to have, instead of having a wall here, we would have this landscaping, basically, instead of a retaining wall, this is a sloped area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1170.79s">So</a>  all of this green that you see is basically sloping from the courtyard down to the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1177.935s">And</a>  then here it starts to slope up to meet the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1182.248s">So</a>  what we're really asking for is an easement to have some basically grassy area and some xeriscaping, so drought-resistant plants. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1191.435s">This</a>  is the accessible connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1193.136s">So</a>  this part of the sidewalk that's in this part of the plaza that's accessible is on city land. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1198.6s">The</a>  same thing here, basically grass and some xeriscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1203.244s">Oh,</a>  well, there's just kind of a slope that you walk next to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1207.307s">It's</a>  a much nicer pedestrian experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1211.291s">This</a>  is a picture of before the project happened, this is basically the slope that happens at the site between the sidewalk and the site, as you know that sidewalk going up here is really steep, and then the site itself kind of dropped off. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1224.308s">We're</a>  really trying to make it a situation where it's nice for pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1227.89s">There's</a>  my internet connections unstable, but where they're basically walking next to, like I said, kind of a landscaped area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1235.415s">We're</a>  not going to build anything else on this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1237.497s">It's</a>  just landscape. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1238.518s">We</a>  will maintain snow removal, trash removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1242.3s">This</a>  will always be an open, accessible connection from the sidewalk to the front of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1250.553s">We</a>  can take any questions if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1252.273s">And</a>  again, if my internet goes out, then I think Rocco and Mr. Abruzzese can respond, but I'd be happy to take questions.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1259.095s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1259.475s">I'll</a>  assume that that makes the plaza handicap accessible.</p>

    <p>[Ruthie Bennett]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1265.857s">Yes,</a>  exactly right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1266.878s">This</a>  is a handicap accessible connection from the sidewalk to the building, the whole plaza and the cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1272.379s">So</a>  yes, this is all accessible from the sidewalk right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1276.0s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1962.531s">Mr.</a>  Kavanaugh, Mr. President, was a gentleman who was also a member of the Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1982.023s">picked</a>  up the torch where he left off in her efforts in volunteering in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1986.507s">We</a>  all know Carrie from Channel 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1988.328s">She</a>  hosted last year's mayoral debate as a matter of fact, two years ago, the mayoral debate as a matter of fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1993.933s">But</a>  Paul was just a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1996.174s">His</a>  wife was a school teacher and they met through public schools for a number of years, and they're really some people that have given a lot to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2002.239s">And</a>  Paul had a very public battle with cancer and he succumbed to the effects <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2007.116s">thereof,</a>  and he'll be sorely missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2009.318s">So</a>  with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2012.48s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2014.101s">So</a>  on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2019.645s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2022.167s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2022.867s">Please</a>  rise for a moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2039.51s">2-1,</a>  4-2-6, offered by Council Marks, being resolved that Teresa Castagnetti, lead teacher coach in the English Learners Department for the Medford Public School be recognized for a 45 year commitment and leadership to the students of Medford on a recent retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2056.461s">Council</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2057.561s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2058.842s">It's</a>  my honor to stand before this council and the residents of this community to honor one of Medford's finest, Mr. President, Teresa Castagnetti, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2068.797s">I</a>  think we all, behind this reel, know Teresa. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2072.818s">Teresa</a>  was an advocate for our students, serving as the lead teacher and coach for the English Learners Department for many decades, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2083.621s">Teresa</a>  had a career that was remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2087.262s">She</a>  always stood up for what she believed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2089.623s">Even</a>  recently, as of last year, Mr. President, when the condition of the sidewalks and the curbing and the road into the McGlynn <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2098.375s">and</a>  Andrews Middle School was in poor condition and caused trip and hazards for parents, children, and faculty, Teresa was the first one to step forward and kept on stepping forward, bringing this council up to date on the needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2116.768s">And</a>  it was Teresa Castagnetti that I largely credit for making those things happen within that area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2126.787s">Teresa</a>  worked in the Kids' Corner daycare as executive board chairperson and secretary from 1992 to 95. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2135.293s">So</a>  in addition to her duties as a lead teacher, she also found the time to work in the Kids' Corner daycare as an executive member, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2145.419s">Back</a>  in 2015, annual state award given to a teacher who exemplifies excellence in the education of English language learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2154.833s">through</a>  evidence of best instructional practices, long-term commitment to the education of ELLS, leadership roles at the school's district, level of behalf of the ELLs, mentoring of new ELL teachers through formal induction programs, and strong relationships to parents of ELLs in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2178.479s">So</a>  back in 2015, Teresa received the Distinguished Award <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2184.053s">Teacher</a>  of the Year, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2185.874s">It's</a>  a statewide award, and believe me, they were able to recognize the merits of Teresa Castagnetti and her accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2196.741s">Teresa</a>  served as the ELE teacher for the Medford Public Schools from 2016 to 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2201.564s">Teresa</a>  was a mentor teacher for the Medford Public Schools from 2001 to 2021, over 20 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2212.89s">She</a>  was a supervising practitioner for several general education teachers and Lesley University graduate students to complete their 150-hour internship towards ESL licensure. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2225.535s">And</a>  from 2008 to 2014, Teresa was selected by DESE to participate on several DESE panels and committees for assessment and development standard settings for the Statewide Language Proficiency Exam and train the trainer cohorts <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2242.846s">and</a>  second language learning and teaching, in which Teresa, in turn, provided professional development for the district, right here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2252.55s">Teresa</a>  also served as co-chairperson for the McGlynn Elementary School literacy team. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2257.892s">And</a>  in 2008, 2009, Teresa co-chaired the creation of the district's first school-based literacy team, which established uniform K through five literacy assessment protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2270.096s">and</a>  a building-wide K-5 literacy action plan for the McGlynn Elementary School, which was adopted as a model for the district, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2279.122s">I</a>  can only say, Mr. President, that knowing Theresa over the years, knowing her professionalism, the way she dealt with her colleagues, the way she dealt with parents, faculty, students, I think goes unmatched in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2296.574s">And</a>  it's only appropriate that <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2298.365s">I</a>  rise here today thanking her for her 45 years of commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2302.127s">I</a>  would ask that Teresa receive a council accommodation for her years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2306.788s">And</a>  I also want to thank her, Mr. President, for putting up with Andrew Castagnetti, her lovely husband for many years, Mr. President, who we all know and love as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2321.194s">And</a>  I just want to thank Teresa and wish her well on her retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2324.596s">And</a>  I'm sure we're going to see her around the community, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2440.366s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2442.127s">One</a>  thing that's always amazed me about Teresa was <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2445.593s">The</a>  passion that she had for the job, she never lost that passion and love for the job, even after, you know, four and a half decades of teaching, she was still coming up there advocating for the students when the easy thing to do after four and a half decades of teaching would be to say, oh, the next generation is going to take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2460.84s">She's</a>  someone that certainly led by example, put her money where her mouth is, and was always out here working on behalf of the children in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2467.583s">So</a>  it's something <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2468.853s">that</a>  I think is very grateful, that I'm very grateful for Mr. President, the effort and energy that she put forth, how she went above and beyond to do some of the things that she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2477.379s">And</a>  I want her to enjoy her retirement as best as she possibly can in the lovely neighborhood of East Method.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2583.703s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2584.703s">I</a>  want to thank you for co-sponsoring this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2587.364s">Here</a>  we are once again, Mr. President, another faculty member within our public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2594.465s">42</a>  years of dedication to the students, the parents, and to our Medford public school system, I think is something that really deserves recognition, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2607.047s">Cheryl</a>  Mayarco is a well-respected employee of the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2611.873s">in</a>  the special ed department, who dedicated over 42 years of service to our most vulnerable students. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2619.235s">Cheryl</a>  started a career in method as a substitute teacher and instructional aid in 1978. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2626.857s">Cheryl</a>  became a special education teacher in 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2631.358s">For</a>  the past 20 years, Cheryl has worked tirelessly as an evaluation team leader, providing mentoring and guidance to newer ETLs <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2641.838s">and</a>  staff members. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2643.758s">Cheryl</a>  was passionate about the Children of Method, acting as a strong advocate for student needs and making personal connections with every student she assisted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2656.22s">Cheryl</a>  was dedicated to caring for the whole child, communicating with parents, caregivers, and educational team members. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2664.722s">Cheryl</a>  was always expanding her knowledge and her expertise to be prepared and responsive to families and students <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2671.93s">of</a>  method. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2673.992s">Colleagues</a>  and families remarked that Cheryl went over and above in assisting families and students with patience, positive attitude, and a caring nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2685.38s">And</a>  for all of us that know Cheryl, Mr. President, know these words are completely true. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2692.285s">Cheryl</a>  gave everything she could to her job. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2695.427s">She</a>  liked what she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2697.629s">She</a>  excelled what she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2699.886s">And</a>  she really made, I think, a lot of strides in the special ed department. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2706.852s">She</a>  was someone that you can count on to make sure that if services were needed for a child, Cheryl would fight for the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2714.378s">You</a>  didn't need to hire an outside advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2716.6s">It</a>  was Cheryl Mayorko that would step up and make sure that each and every child received the proper services, Mr. President, for their education. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2726.809s">And</a>  parents respected that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2729.104s">um,</a>  in our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2730.845s">Uh,</a>  you know, the my uncle couple, which I refer to as Cheryl, my uncle and Robert, my uncle, who served on this body for over three decades, um, and the capacity of council president is and as a member of this body, uh, they were a power couple in this community, Mr. President, for many decades, and both were well respected and leaders in this community, and they continue to be leaders in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2757.224s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2758.242s">I</a>  would personally like to ask Mr. President that Cheryl Mayarco receive a council accommodation for her 42 years of dedicated service to our students, our most vulnerable students, parents, faculty, and the entire community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2777.428s">I</a>  would like to thank her.</p>

    <p>[Bill Giglio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2921.606s">Giglio,</a>  Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2923.567s">I</a>  also would like to thank Cheryl when I saw this on the agenda tonight, I wanted to come down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2929.249s">We've</a>  known Cheryl since my boys were in grade school, but now more importantly, since we took on the task of taking custody of a three-year-old who's very behind special needs since day one, since the M.E.E.T. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2943.975s">program,</a>  preschool, kindergarten, now going into first grade, Cheryl has taken the ball with her <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2948.987s">Not</a>  only has she given her the assistance that we thought she needed, but she's given her extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2953.808s">She's,</a>  she's really good. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2954.808s">I</a>  know Mr. Falco says there's thousands of kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2957.249s">I</a>  can speak for one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2959.089s">Um,</a>  and I, I couldn't say thank you any more to, uh, miss Mayako. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2963.67s">Um,</a>  and again, if, if there's ever a question that she emailed us with and we didn't get back to her, she would call us on the phone just to make sure she got that answer, whatever information she needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2974.152s">So</a>  personally, I'd like to thank miss Mayako as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2977.533s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2978.765s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3018.27s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3019.67s">This</a>  was an item that was put on the agenda last week under public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3024.912s">And</a>  we had a number of residents that came up to speak on their concerns regarding the now, I guess, resolved issue of the naming of the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3035.796s">That</a>  was somewhat of a lengthy process that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3039.618s">I</a>  believe there was much division in the community over this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3044.12s">Many</a>  people felt that they weren't heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3047.282s">Many</a>  people felt that they weren't part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3050.283s">And</a>  what I'm offering here tonight, Mr. President, is that we take a closer look at the naming of any building in the community, whether it's on the school side or the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3063.369s">As</a>  a member of the school committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3065.337s">I</a>  can attest to you firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3067.598s">I</a>  actually am one of the members that actually voted against the naming of one of our schools back some 20 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3077.261s">And</a>  it wasn't because I was opposed to the name, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3080.502s">It</a>  was more of a process issue I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3083.383s">And</a>  at the time, I felt there wasn't enough public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3086.685s">There</a>  wasn't enough community participation in regards to the selection of the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3091.326s">And</a>  therefore, I actually voted against <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3093.951s">the</a>  naming of one of our, what we refer to as new schools now that are 20 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3099.736s">I</a>  would say, Mr. President, that in a community of this size, when you're talking about naming a school building, and know that many of these buildings, whether it's a municipal building, or a park, or the corner of an intersection that's named, this has personal memories to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3119.573s">It</a>  has personal feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3122.91s">And</a>  I think we have to be very mindful of that when we have a process to look at the renaming. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3129.832s">I'm</a>  not opposed to renaming. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3131.533s">I'm</a>  not opposed to looking at things in retrospect, but what I am opposed to Mr. President is a process where people feel left out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3141.755s">And</a>  if one person feels left out, that's enough for me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3146.377s">And</a>  I'm respectfully asking that we ask our city solicitor <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3151.292s">I</a>  don't doubt for a second that the school committee has the authority to name a building, and I've told people that over the past year and a half, that they have the ability to name a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3161.719s">All</a>  I'm asking is whether or not the Medford City Council, through way of an ordinance, can create a policy, Mr. President, that includes the entire community when it comes to looking at municipal or school-owned buildings, and that we create <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3179.8s">a</a>  policy and procedure that ultimately has the goal of incorporating every comment, every person's wishes, and coming out with a process that we can all feel proud of at the end and not have the division that we're seeing right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3198.614s">And</a>  that's all this is trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3200.856s">This</a>  is not trying to take away anyone's responsibilities, anyone's duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3205.719s">It's</a>  seeing a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3207.821s">When</a>  I see a community divided, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3209.794s">That</a>  concerns me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3210.495s">I've</a>  been around a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3212.336s">And</a>  when I see a community divided over an issue, we as legislators, the executive branch, I think have to step up and say, how do we better this process? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3222.184s">How</a>  do we make it so we don't have to go through this every time we may decide that we want to rename something? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3228.69s">And</a>  I feel that if this process continues in the manner it's going, all it's going to do is create division. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3236.756s">And</a>  that would include on the municipal side. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3239.446s">So</a>  I'm not saying this is strictly a school issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3242.167s">It's</a>  on the municipal side as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3243.508s">So</a>  I'm saying, open up the process to the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3247.109s">And</a>  those are my comments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3248.89s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3251.751s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3253.072s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3255.993s">I</a>  certainly don't disagree that a standard process and procedure that would allow for, you know, the renaming of any municipal facility or building or <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3267.71s">I</a>  think we might even want to outline everything we mean here because he meant in corners and streets and that kind of thing would be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3274.613s">My</a>  only concern goes back to what you were saying about who has the authority around school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3280.515s">I</a>  think I could support this if we didn't include the school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3283.757s">And</a>  I think whatever we come up with for the city side could easily be taken up as a model by the school committee to use for school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3289.839s">I</a>  just have concerns around the legal authority as outlined and I wouldn't want <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3295.485s">I</a>  wouldn't want the city solicitor to come back and say, well, you don't have the authority around school buildings, X, Y, Z. So that's my main concern here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3302.107s">Other</a>  than that, I agree that having a strong process with clear outcomes, certainly, hopefully we'll bring at least more people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3310.809s">I</a>  don't know if we're ever going to get everyone to agree to every renaming, but I think it's important that we try. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3315.11s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3315.89s">So,</a>  Mr. President, I appreciate those comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3319.031s">And</a>  I would only state that what I'm trying to do through this resolution <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3323.679s">is</a>  ask our chief legal officer, who is attorney Kim Scanlon, whether or not we first of all have the jurisdiction and authority to create an ordinance that would cover a separate body. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3336.045s">The</a>  school committee is a separate body. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3337.425s">They're</a>  an autonomous body. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3339.006s">And</a>  I understand the boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3341.667s">However,</a>  we are the legislative body for the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3345.069s">And</a>  the school committee falls under the purview of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3349.911s">And</a>  if the <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3352.171s">solicitor</a>  came back and said, I don't believe that you can do that as a council through way of ordinance, to me, then the issue would be dropped by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3360.194s">I'm</a>  not gonna pursue anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3362.375s">But</a>  if the city solicitor came back and said, indeed, you have the ability to do that, I think that would call for a subcommittee or committee of the whole, maybe even a joint meeting with the school committee and the administration to discuss next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3375.399s">But</a>  all I'm doing is asking what our options are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3380.454s">and</a>  not forcing anything on anyone at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3383.955s">So</a>  that's all I wanna get across, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3389.937s">Perhaps</a>  can we ask two questions instead of one then? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3394.158s">Could</a>  the city ask the city solicitor for a ruling on whether the council through ordinance can craft a process for the naming of a school building? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3402.02s">And</a>  then maybe the second one could be a further resolve that the city council ask the city solicitor for <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3408.554s">an</a>  example of a process for the naming of any municipal building or facility, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3413.897s">I</a>  just wanna make sure we ask both questions so we get an answer on each of them.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3421.923s">The</a>  way that I'm reading this is no more than the councilor asking a question as to whether or not the Medford city council is a legal authority to establish and define a process to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3430.208s">It's</a>  not in from what I can read a motion or an attempt to preclude <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3435.682s">any</a>  elected body from exercising their rights, what it's doing is establishing, requesting more or less an opinion as to whether or not a universal and standardized process can be crafted so that that can be utilized across all realms of government when it comes to the renaming of any type of facility of the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3456.276s">I</a>  don't really think we need to split hairs over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3458.318s">It's</a>  not like we're trying to step on anybody's toes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3460.399s">All</a>  we're doing is asking the question, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3461.859s">can</a>  we establish a process? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3463.1s">And</a>  if we do establish that process, is it good for the school department as well as the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3467.903s">I</a>  don't see what's scary about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3469.104s">If</a>  in fact, it comes back with the answer that's a yes, then that's a whole different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3473.287s">But</a>  until we get there, I think that there's no harm in asking the question as presented.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3480.231s">If</a>  I may, but that's exactly, you kind of outlined exactly my point, which is that it's, can we do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3485.395s">And</a>  can we do this specifically for schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3489.095s">If</a>  we ask this question, I think we've gone through this before where we've asked a question and the language hasn't been quite right, and we've gotten kind of a wavery answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3497.398s">I'm</a>  just concerned that if we ask the question this way, the answer might be no, because the school committee has authority over schools instead of, you know, no, you can't do it for schools, but yes, you can do it for municipal buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3508.061s">So</a>  I guess I would just amend the paper to ask that the city solicitor specifically rule on whether we can craft a process for schools, municipal buildings, or for both.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3521.386s">I</a>  think that's what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3522.606s">And</a>  I'm not opposed to change the language around, but I think that's what it says.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3526.107s">And</a>  that's the, I'm not disputing the intent at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3528.828s">Just,</a>  I want to get the answer that we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3535.41s">Just</a>  that the city solicitors specifically issue a ruling on whether the council through ordinance can craft a process for naming schools, school buildings and facilities, municipal buildings and facilities, or <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3550.993s">both</a>  of those categories.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3553.655s">Why</a>  don't we just say something that's almost exactly what it says.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3557.377s">I'm</a>  just trying to ask two questions.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3559.758s">Next</a>  time I'll put you on the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3562.44s">Co</a>  sponsor and how about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3565.401s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3566.182s">It</a>  feels like I'm nitpicking. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3567.503s">I'm</a>  really just going back to the what you stated.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3570.204s">It's</a>  almost says verbatim what you just stated.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3573.006s">I</a>  hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3574.047s">It's</a>  going back to the question that we asked around the authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3578.849s">Now</a>  I'm blanking on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3583.896s">the</a>  disagreement between the solicitor and the administration on a legal question on the cast. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3588.98s">And</a>  we asked a question and the answer came back, well, maybe, and now there's this dispute. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3593.142s">I</a>  just wanna be really specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3594.483s">And</a>  that's the only reason I'm making this point.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3596.965s">Okay,</a>  I see the language is saying, but good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3600.868s">Good</a>  evening, name and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3605.751s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, can we put, oh, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3607.633s">Thank</a>  you, G News on 35 Parish Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3610.334s">Councilor</a>  Marks, thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3613.531s">As</a>  someone who works in process regularly, I was really very disheartened by the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3620.255s">I</a>  know the folks that volunteered worked very hard, but I think we could benefit as a community by something with better shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3630.16s">I</a>  would hope that we could get an answer to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3632.061s">And</a>  I think we should even be looking at our parks and other facilities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3636.283s">As</a>  you say, we have a habit of making, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3641.307s">street</a>  corners named after folks and other areas throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3644.968s">And</a>  I think as a community, if we have a clear understanding of what the expectation is, that helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3649.89s">And</a>  then you may even see opportunity for people to step forward because it's clear what they would be volunteering exactly to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3656.933s">So</a>  I think anytime you can put shape around a process, it's better. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3660.434s">We</a>  do it for other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3661.455s">We</a>  have multiple hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3663.115s">We</a>  have requirements for three hearings when we do amendments and when we're looking at implications to different <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3671.17s">projects</a>  to the city, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3672.731s">And</a>  so this seems to dovetail into everything else we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3675.934s">So</a>  I appreciate you bringing it forward and I appreciate your position on clarity, but I definitely think it's something that's well worth looking into because personally, I would really hate to see our community go through something like that again, if we can craft a process that just provides everybody the opportunity to be heard <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3697.282s">and</a>  iterative opportunity for feedback, and that didn't happen, I think, as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3702.443s">I</a>  think folks submitted on the issue at hand, saw what the results were, and then there was no opportunity for additional conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3712.085s">And</a>  I think that that was a good part of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3716.505s">So</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3717.726s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3718.166s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3721.206s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3724.667s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, can you please unmute Mr. Castagnetti? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3730.84s">Hold</a>  on, Andrew. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3739.327s">He's</a>  not on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3741.108s">Okay,</a>  good evening, Andrew. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3742.89s">Name</a>  and address of the record.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3828.153s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3829.433s">So</a>  Ben is the MIT System Design and Management Industry and Certificate Director and the 2021 awardee of the Collier Medal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3837.558s">So</a>  MIT gives out a number of staff excellence awards each year, which are among the highest honors to staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3844.021s">As</a>  is the tradition, there's only one Collier Medal award winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3847.507s">And</a>  that's Ben, her Medford neighbor, Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3850.968s">And</a>  the Collier Medal was established in 2014 to honor MIT police officer Sean Collier and his commitment to community engagement and model citizenship. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3859.469s">As</a>  I said, it's among the highest honors that MIT awards its staff and community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3864.11s">Ben</a>  was awarded this because in the spring of 2020, as the WHO declared COVID-19 to be an official pandemic and case numbers rose in Massachusetts, groups and individuals across MIT and the state sought ways to help <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3877.338s">Ben's</a>  background in the medical device industry and his training in applying a systems approach to socio-technical challenges immediately proved useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3885.083s">And</a>  he worked closely with professors in the Department of Mechanical Engineering to navigate the rapidly evolving response across the Institute and identify labs and other groups that could join these efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3895.669s">So</a>  through this work, Ben connected with the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, who convened experts from a variety of fields to form what became the Massachusetts Manufacturing Emergency Response Team. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3907.235s">And</a>  this collaborative, which was cross-disciplinary and cross-industry, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3912.3s">played</a>  a key role in the Baker-Polito administration's initial response to COVID-19, and the Massachusetts Manufacturing Emergency Response Team helped local manufacturers pivot their operations to produce PPE and other much-needed supplies for healthcare workers at scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3926.21s">And</a>  Ben helped lead the effort to provide medical device development guidance to manufacturers, and he also served as the team's key liaison with FDA officials and ensured that critical emergency regulatory requirements were addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3938.218s">So</a>  for these efforts, Ben was awarded the medal <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3940.89s">And</a>  I want to just take a moment to recognize him for this tremendous achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3944.992s">I</a>  know there are many, many Medford residents who contributed in many ways to the COVID-19 response, but I just want to call out this really high honor offered by MIT for his work across the state and just thank his neighbor, Laurel Ruma, for reaching out and ensuring that the community knows about one of its residents in this really important award.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3965.804s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4129.98s">If</a>  you give us a brief description of the project.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4134.655s">Yeah,</a>  so we applied to the CPA to fix a hole that is in our roof, which is right above our archives. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4143.479s">So</a>  this is an emergency because too much water damage could not only destroy, cause severe damage to the building, but also destroy our institutional records, as well as rebuilding our chimney, which is failing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4177.014s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4179.075s">Has</a>  there been any temporary work done? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4180.796s">So</a>  if it is leaking now, until this work gets done, that you won't have any damage or lose documents?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4187.658s">Yeah,</a>  so basically right now we have a barrel which is catching all of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4193.495s">the</a>  water, and as soon as this is approved, the contractors will begin work.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4199.719s">So</a>  nothing on the top of the roof, just temporarily a top or something that could stop?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4204.683s">No,</a>  when the roofers came out, there's a roof cap in the hole, so it didn't really make a lot of sense to start working on it before we could secure the funding, because to replace the roof cap is already really expensive.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4221.534s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4224.113s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4225.294s">Thank</a>  you for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4226.255s">Do</a>  you know how, so once the contractor gets the okay, do we know how long the project's going to take?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4231.778s">Yeah,</a>  so we are on the schedule in July to get the chimney repair, because that has to go first, and then the roof will be repaired by Old Mohawk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4243.026s">And</a>  that will happen as well, also in July, as soon as the chimney is done.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4247.79s">So</a>  we're thinking about it by August?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4249.971s">By</a>  August, hopefully we will have it fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4254.258s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4325.849s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4328.43s">Over</a>  the last 10 days, along with my city council colleagues, I have taken actions to get answers because the residents of Medford and the city of Medford employees deserve the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4339.373s">Now</a>  more than ever, we must think, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4342.393s">have</a>  increased awareness about the dynamics of power and vigorously pursue ways to create inclusive and competent work environments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4351.701s">Although</a>  personnel issues are not in the purview of the Medford City Council, we have the responsibility to the employees and to the citizens of Medford to maintain a community of equity and inclusion and to advocate for full transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4368.472s">In</a>  the instances described, Mayor Lungo-Koehn and a leadership team have failed Medford and I will not stand by and allow our talented city staff to be tarnished or degraded. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4378.397s">Every</a>  single city council have voted to take an independent and impartial investigation into this matter, requested appropriations from the mayor to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4389.243s">In</a>  a public document from Mayor Lungo-Koehn to the president of the city council dated June 28th, 2021, the mayor denied this request because <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4398.299s">It,</a>  and I quote, is nothing more than a political ploy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4405.966s">For</a>  the mayor of the state, the council's request to seek an independent investigation regarding this matter is a political ploy, is an absolute insult, not only to the members of this council, but to the two employees making these allegations. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4421.799s">The</a>  statement by the mayor downplays the seriousness <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4425.225s">of</a>  these allegations dismisses the integrity and reputation of the employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4430.527s">It</a>  calls into question mayor's integrity and motivation in investigating these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4437.81s">During</a>  the council's emergency meeting on June 23rd, city solicitor Kim Scanlon was asked to describe the process of how the third party investigator was selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4448.615s">City</a>  solicitor Scanlon stated, and I quote, made a recommendation and listed down <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4454.95s">to</a>  two candidates, and earlier today, the mayor agreed to the first candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4462.232s">This</a>  is in complete and total contrast to what the mayor stated in the June 28th letter to President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4468.754s">In</a>  that letter, the mayor stated the following, I did not participate in the selection of the third party then or now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4476.235s">A</a>  statement released to the Medford transcript by the city on June 24th, the mayor directed the city solicitor to engage the services of an independent third party selected by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4488.603s">And</a>  you wonder why the council sought to hire an outside counsel and an investigator. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4493.306s">For</a>  the mayor to deny the council's request for funds is simply outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4500.11s">The</a>  resolution tonight is basically to get more information <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4503.718s">with</a>  regard to the private investigator that was hired by the administration on or before June 23rd, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4510.081s">The</a>  bullets points state exactly what I'm looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4516.844s">That's</a>  a copy of the signed contract for the investigatory services, a description of the procurement process used for this contract, a detail of funding source, line item and scope of services to be provided <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4530.762s">and</a>  a copy of the city ordinance the city solicitor is relying on as a basis for the procurement and hiring by the administration for this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4540.306s">I</a>  thank you for your time and I move approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4543.027s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4543.667s">Any</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4547.689s">On</a>  motion by Councilor Powell, seconded by Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4554.771s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4555.512s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4556.792s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4558.033s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4560.859s">2,</a>  1, 4, 3, 6 offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the 2021 municipal preliminary election be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4570.744s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4573.205s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4575.006s">So</a>  the purpose of this resolution is pretty literal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4578.728s">I</a>  was hoping we could have a discussion about the 2021 municipal preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4583.47s">As</a>  many residents know, from time to time during municipal election season, the city holds preliminary elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4590.378s">In</a>  recent years, I believe they have eliminated effectively one candidate out of a pool of 15 or 16 or two from 16 for city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4600.884s">It's</a>  a very costly exercise. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4603.766s">I</a>  believe it costs upwards of $50,000 of taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4607.328s">And</a>  the outcome is really saying, well, you know, we're gonna have you pick from 14 candidates instead of 15 candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4615.617s">I</a>  think if that's the case, it may not be the best use of taxpayer dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4619.999s">I</a>  also think there's an argument that letting everybody run in the general election is a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4624.782s">We're</a>  not eliminating one or two candidates from the outset. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4629.244s">And</a>  I'm just interested into what my other fellow Councilors think about potentially filing a home rule petition to cancel the preliminary election and just allow all candidates to run in the November general election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4640.59s">One</a>  other reason I bring this up is significant <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4644.198s">legislative</a>  uncertainty around the option of mail-in voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4648.1s">It</a>  seems like the legislature may not pass a law by the time necessary to allow mail ballots for the preliminary election, but then may do it in time for the general election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4658.967s">So</a>  then we're talking about a different set of rules for each election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4662.229s">And</a>  I think it may just be better given the conditions that we're operating under to have the elections office focusing on making sure that the November election runs smoothly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4671.993s">Those</a>  are just some points for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4673.694s">I'm</a>  interested into what my other fellow Councilors think, and hopefully we can maybe take some action on it tonight.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4680.359s">If</a>  I can refer to the clerk for a little explanation to Councilor Bears, any guidance?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4689.686s">Councilor</a>  Bears is correct that this would require a home repetition to be canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4695.751s">And</a>  the estimate of $50,000 is the number that my predecessor <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4702.707s">often</a>  quoted to me for the cost of a preliminary municipal election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4706.948s">That's</a>  a back of the envelope calculation, but it's one that my predecessor used and was very confident in using.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4715.429s">Mr.</a>  President, nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4716.769s">I</a>  certainly can appreciate the measure in terms of when it comes to cost savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4723.671s">I</a>  don't think that that's necessarily a bad thing to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4727.371s">I</a>  do have concern over the process and when we make this determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4733.012s">if</a>  there's 15 candidates today, but there's 27 tomorrow, you know, where do we draw the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4739.473s">I</a>  guess the question that I have, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4741.073s">Do</a>  we wait till the papers close? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4742.074s">How</a>  much time do we need to get this legislation to get passed before we have to, can we do it after the paper deadline closes, but still have enough time to pass the normal petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4750.735s">You</a>  know, those are some of the questions that are from an operational standpoint that come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4755.256s">And</a>  I think that because of those questions in the past, we haven't really acted on a measure like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4762.213s">that</a>  couple with the fact that the city charter defines how we're supposed to move, leaves this up to be really a philosophical argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4770.998s">I</a>  certainly can support the idea of about $50,000 worth of cost savings, number one, and the uncertainty surrounding the ability to get the mail-in voting approved prior to the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4782.746s">So</a>  those are things that would certainly warrant some consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4787.509s">And</a>  if this Home Rule petition is something that does come up, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4790.261s">Those</a>  will be the items that I'm thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4793.024s">I</a>  certainly don't have a problem putting the question before this body, having us deliberate that to a full extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4799.052s">I</a>  think that's kind of like the intent of this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4803.497s">The</a>  council has put this paper forward to have a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4806.42s">I</a>  certainly don't have a problem having a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4808.142s">I</a>  don't even have a problem having the whole petition drafted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4810.762s">and</a>  having us have the opportunity to discuss and debate about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4814.264s">Um,</a>  you know, so with that being said, I can support the paper this evening if we're asking for a future beating for some defined parameters on how we're going to figure this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4823.409s">But,</a>  you know, at the same time, a child does call for preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4827.972s">Uh,</a>  you know, there's 15 candidates in the race. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4831.174s">Um,</a>  so it is what it is.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4834.276s">Thank</a>  you for the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4836.237s">Council</a>  morale.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4837.537s">I</a>  just want to echo vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4839.018s">I</a>  think councilor bears bringing this forward, but I think I have the same concerns as far as process and timing, just understanding if the pool does grow exponentially, which it can, you know, where are we then? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4847.984s">So</a>  just can we drop this paper after the deadline? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4851.706s">Can,</a>  will we get a response in time, which I don't know if we'll get those answers until it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4856.649s">But</a>  I do think this is something that warrants for the discussion.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4859.371s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4865.272s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleague for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4869.756s">The</a>  questions I would have, Mr. President, surround, you know, we're talking about city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4875.219s">It's</a>  very possible that if there's a third candidate into the mayor's race, that that could trigger off a preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4883.785s">And</a>  as we all know, Mr. President, depending on the number of people running for an office has an impact on the potential impact on the outcome of that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4894.092s">I</a>  think there's a lot to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4896.693s">Also,</a>  I think anytime a body that could be perceived as doing something self-serving is something that you have to proceed with caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4906.735s">And</a>  indeed, in my opinion, and I've stated this for years, the fact that the Bedford City Council is in order in the general election, an alphabetical order, and all the challenges are after us, it's a known fact that when it comes to the election process, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4923.346s">your</a>  positioning on the ballot has an impact on, you know, what you may get for votes, you know, the first and the last, and there's a whole science to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4934.949s">And</a>  believe me, I don't wanna be someone that may be perceived as putting forth something that may impact someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4943.791s">You</a>  know, a new candidate running for public office wants to know, and a primary is, a preliminary is a good way of doing it, wants to know their strengths and weaknesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4953.474s">And</a>  that's an excellent way for a new candidate to say, you know what, I didn't do that well in the primary, I'm gonna focus on this area and this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4960.377s">What</a>  you're effectively doing is taking that away from someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4965.1s">And</a>  so there's a lot I think you have to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4967.901s">It's</a>  not just, you know, the savings is great, but I would ask that when you look at an election in the community and when 30%, what's the last percentage in the municipal election, Mr. Clark? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4981.852s">when</a>  30% of the registered voters come out, we should be promoting elections, whether they're preliminary or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4990.234s">I</a>  mean, we should be, and I've thought about this for years, putting out banners and A-frames and getting the message out, promoting elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4998.877s">And</a>  I think when you start to cancel elections, I think what you see is a cheapening of the election process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5007.413s">And,</a>  you know, so I think there's a lot, I'm not throwing this down, but I just think there's a lot to take into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5014.3s">And,</a>  you know, I'm not opposed to looking at this, but I really have some reservations on any time an elected a body that has a vested interest, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5024.93s">The</a>  finance is one thing, but you also have a vested interest in getting reelected, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5030.376s">And</a>  anytime you use your influence that may hinder someone else, whether you think it does or not, I mean, it's something that needs to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5038.941s">In</a>  the past, Mr. President, and I think a couple of years ago, there was a letter sent out by one of the candidates asking all the other candidates, what are your thoughts on canceling the primary? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5049.806s">I</a>  think there were one or two extra candidates, and why spend the money, as Councilor Bears mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5054.829s">And</a>  we got a mixed bag back from candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5057.15s">Some</a>  wanted to keep it, some were opposed, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5060.092s">So</a>  I think these are the discussions I think we have to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5063.113s">So</a>  I'm not opposed to what Vice President Knight mentioned about taking a closer look, but I'm not sold on, you know, canceling any primary at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5073.374s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5074.875s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5076.575s">I'd</a>  agree with Councilor Marks as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5078.475s">I</a>  have a quick question through you to the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5083.236s">What's</a>  the timing as far as when would you need to have an answer to send a homeowner petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5087.397s">I</a>  would imagine there's a process behind that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5089.416s">Well,</a>  the ballot, if there is a preliminary election, and it very much looks like it will be at this point, the ballot order drawing would be Friday, August 13th, I believe at nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5104.702s">So</a>  there would have to be some sort of, likely some sort of answer before then, because I would be ordering the ballots the next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5113.625s">If</a>  the drawing is Friday, I wouldn't be able to get the ballots ordered on Friday, but I would definitely order them early the following week. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5120.28s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5121.501s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5122.641s">Scarpelli.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5123.121s">Through</a>  you to the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5126.223s">With</a>  that, again, remind everybody when the last day to accept nomination papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5131.625s">I</a>  think the last day to accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5135.127s">August</a>  10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5136.848s">10th?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5137.668s">No,</a>  there's a July. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5139.689s">There</a>  were July deadlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5140.69s">There's</a>  a July 23rd deadline for the last day to pull the papers and a July 23rd deadline for the last day to return the certificate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5145.972s">It</a>  was the last day to pull, so 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5148.263s">23rd</a>  is the last day to pull, 27th is the last day to return the certified papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5151.946s">Okay,</a>  so again, I think that I appreciate that, and I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing that forward, because that's one thing I looked at when we first started running. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5160.073s">You</a>  look at primary, the savings is the number one thing, but I think that it's important that we still don't know what tomorrow brings, and I think it's a little too early, I think, because like Councilor Mark said, you had another candidate for the mayor's race, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5177.148s">and</a>  you don't run a primary, that can play a huge factor in what happens in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5183.01s">So</a>  I think that, unfortunately, I think timing is one of the biggest issues, and I feel the same as my fellow colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5191.093s">And</a>  I appreciate listening to you, talking about it, because it is a conversation that I think a lot of people in the community ask, because as Council Member Mark said the last time, it was really 50-50, not only with the candidates, but also with the constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5203.538s">I</a>  can't tell you how many times, if you don't have a primary, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5206.292s">we</a>  save a teacher and it sounds great in essence, but you know, with the process, I think that the due process that we have in place is there for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5213.914s">And</a>  I think that it's something that with the time being so congested and so questionable to move forward with eliminating is a little shaky for me.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5226.416s">So,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5227.836s">Thank</a>  you, Councilman Baez. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5231.117s">A</a>  few years ago when I was president, I think like three, four years ago, there was a 15 person race <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5236.532s">I</a>  was asked to do exactly what he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5239.754s">All</a>  the candidates signed an affidavit saying they wanted to skip the primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5246.137s">And</a>  by the time of them signing it to be getting it to the clerk and the solicitor, half of them had changed their minds. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5257.784s">It</a>  does warrant some discussion in many cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5262.78s">done</a>  away with the primaries due to cost saving, where they changed the parameter of what constitutes a primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5269.247s">So,</a>  again, but you're still looking at some of what seems to happen, but it does warrant some further discussion going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5277.575s">And</a>  maybe everyone who turned papers in may not be picked up, may not turn their back. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5283.26s">So,</a>  we'll wait and see where that goes.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5288.863s">And</a>  this is exactly what I was looking for by putting it on the way I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5291.604s">I</a>  just wanted to hear from everybody, hear some honest opinions about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5295.845s">I</a>  think the reason I put it on now is also in the timing question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5300.386s">We</a>  start to run out of time in terms of getting it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5303.366s">And</a>  it seems to me like just given the way that our election calendar is currently structured, we're probably not going to be comfortable enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5310.088s">I</a>  mean, there's no way we're going to get a home rule out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5312.675s">you</a>  know, in early August, have it passed by the legislature and back to us by August 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5316.618s">So</a>  I would be comfortable meeting at some point in the future to discuss maybe the election calendar or how this could work in future elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5323.324s">And</a>  I'm sure potentially if there is ever a city charter review, it could come up during that process as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5328.468s">But</a>  I didn't wanna come in here guns blazing with my position on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5332.171s">I</a>  just wanted to see where the council stood on it because I think to Councilor Mark's point, maybe we could really <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5340.516s">boost</a>  the turnout for November with that extra money, put out the A-frames, do more of that outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5345.059s">And</a>  I just want to try to think creatively in the future about how we can get more people engaged in municipal elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5350.424s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5529.39s">Good</a>  evening, Alicia.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5530.951s">Good</a>  evening, honorable Councilors.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5533.813s">Give</a>  us a description.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5535.855s">Sure,</a>  so we're covering the snow and ice with free cash this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5540.599s">We</a>  didn't have any extra surplus because as you know, last year, we expected a cut in our services due to COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5549.927s">We</a>  are doing a transfer into the law budget for KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5554.828s">to</a>  cover KP law services and to cover some security reimbursements that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5561.791s">IT</a>  had a small stipend deficit that we're covering. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5566.194s">Appeals</a>  had a small stipend deficit that we're covering. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5569.976s">Fire</a>  overtime needed to be covered because usually if he has open positions, he's able to cover his overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5575.999s">But</a>  as you know, last year we had to cut a lot of the fire and police positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5580.641s">So</a>  we're covering that with free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5583.762s">Signal</a>  maintenance had a deficit to cover overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5587.304s">Building</a>  inspectors needed to cover their weights and measures stipend for two instead of one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5591.667s">And</a>  they had an unbudgeted sick buyback. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5594.708s">And</a>  the Chevalier needed additional funding for two months of utilities.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5601.892s">Further</a>  questions?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5603.293s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5605.054s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5606.375s">Thank</a>  you, Director Nutley-Benjamin. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5608.476s">I</a>  just had one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5609.396s">What's</a>  our free cash balance going to be after these transfers? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5614.221s">7,000,381,098.92.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5614.241s">And</a>  just to follow up, are we going to be adding to that at all in the fiscal 22 budget?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5627.729s">Yes,</a>  we had a spending freeze implemented early on in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5633.172s">So</a>  we should have some added reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5635.793s">In</a>  addition to that, at the end of the December, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5640.626s">Our</a>  number for growth was more than we'd expected, and that will also bolster our reserves.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5647.849s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5650.67s">Any</a>  further discussion on transfers? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5653.932s">With</a>  this transfer, Mr. President, are we in compliance with municipal finance law?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5766.913s">Yes,</a>  so one of the things that we're allowed to do with the American Rescue Plan Act, also shortened as ARPA, is cover revenue losses. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5774.696s">And</a>  the way that the United States Treasury looked at it is with COVID bringing so much losses, if you calculated based on the fiscal 19 as your base year, and then looked at your calendar year 2020 with 18 months with a 4.1% growth factor, I could take the difference between what we actually collected <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5794.777s">and</a>  with the 4.1%, and that's how I came up with the 12,000,345. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5800.079s">One</a>  thing the US Treasury says is to combine everything into one bucket, but mass general law and the way we do things is by different fund types. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5807.321s">And</a>  I did not feel comfortable, even though we're not given enough guidance on combining 12 million into just the general fund, because I can actually prove out the loss in the general fund and prove the losses on the school revolving funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5820.285s">So</a>  I split it out that way, and I have an Excel calculation and formula that <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5824.585s">shows</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5828.588s">So</a>  is it safe to say, Alicia, that we have a $12 million structural deficit?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5835.393s">Not</a>  a $12 million structural deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5837.454s">What</a>  that is saying is that the $4 million that we lost from the school, they're giving it back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5844.66s">The</a>  money that we lost in hotel revenue and local receipts, they're giving back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5849.745s">and</a>  they're applying a 4.1% growth factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5852.307s">So</a>  instead of us having a loss for the calendar year, they're saying if nothing had happened and the world didn't go into COVID-19, you could have expected a 4.1% growth, this is what it would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5864.436s">So</a>  this is just keeping us steady, like everything's correct until we actually go back to normal.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5872.181s">Okay,</a>  and then what is the structural deficit presently if the budget were to pass this evening?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5878.73s">We</a>  don't have a structural deficit in the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5881.632s">I</a>  think the, as we spoke with the schools and with Dave Murphy, with the ESSER, then you have the ARPA, and then you have the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5890.759s">I</a>  think that with the school's increase is very large. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5895.102s">As</a>  you know, we are constricted by prop two and a half, but that, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5902.537s">3.736</a>  that we're giving them is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5904.961s">That's</a>  what their normal revolving is about 5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5908.946s">Their</a>  revolving went down to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5912.371s">And</a>  then with what we've given them, we gave them a 2% and a 2% of the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5916.917s">So</a>  that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5918.835s">And</a>  I think what they're gonna do with their ESSER money, they just have to be careful and cautious that with their cost structure and how things are, that these are one-time federal revenues and be careful not to build a structural deficit because the usual increase really shouldn't be more than two and a half percent.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5935.725s">Right,</a>  and last year we used about $5.5 million in reserves to balance the budget, right?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5940.868s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5942.309s">So</a>  how much money in reserves are we using this year to balance the budget?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5946.295s">We're</a>  not using any of our reserves this year, except for retained earnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5951.017s">The</a>  500,000 that your honorable body approved for water and sewer to keep the taxpayers increase at 3% for the rate payers for their water and sewer, that's about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5963.703s">No</a>  other reserves are being used.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5965.863s">Except</a>  for this grant money, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5967.544s">This</a>  grant money dries up.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5968.505s">Yeah,</a>  and except for this grant money, which is restoring us back to pre-recession levels.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5975.667s">So</a>  this is non-recurring revenue after the next four years?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5981.148s">Yes,</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5982.868s">It</a>  ends December 31st, 2024, but they've extended it out to 26 if you decide to implement infrastructure projects because it does allow for water, sewer, and broadband projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5997.851s">So</a>  they've extended it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6003.652s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6004.695s">if</a>  by 2024 we don't realize this $12.34 million annually, we're going to be in a situation after this.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6015.321s">We</a>  haven't recovered, but I know the state said they expect us to recover by fiscal year 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6019.603s">That's</a>  what Massachusetts state expects. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6021.564s">So</a>  I didn't buy that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6023.245s">12</a>  31 24 would be fiscal year 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6023.965s">But</a>  if we don't</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6027.5s">recover,</a>  then we're looking at a situation where we might have.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6031.003s">Yeah,</a>  if we didn't recover, then yes, we'd be looking at a situation where we'd be looking at what we need to do, just like we did when COVID first hit.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6038.67s">So</a>  what's the plan in terms of between now and then to bolster our reserve in case we don't recover?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6044.735s">So</a>  as we did this year, we implemented a freeze in January to bolster our reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6051.014s">So</a>  we're not intending on spending any more of our reserves unless it's for capital needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6057.637s">We</a>  are very good at looking at our spending and not overspending. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6061.979s">Usually</a>  we're able to absorb the snow and ice deficit into the general fund operations because there's a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6068.942s">That's</a>  how well managed it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6071.263s">But</a>  because of COVID, we had to use our free cash reserves.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6075.765s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6078.306s">Any</a>  further discussion on the transfers? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6081.582s">Okay,</a>  on the motion, this was on the motion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6088.264s">I</a>  have one more question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6089.845s">This</a>  looks like it's a two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6091.945s">It</a>  says one, will you create the AFA grant account two, will you appropriate the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6095.246s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6096.907s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6098.847s">Will</a>  we need to take two votes?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6105.329s">If</a>  your body thinks you need to take two votes, I'm fine with that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6109.516s">I</a>  think one's a spending paper.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6111.016s">So</a>  that the account was created and then we could transfer the funds directly out of the account into their correct places. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6116.837s">But</a>  if it should be two, I'm absolutely fine with that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6118.998s">I</a>  think one requires five and one requires four.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6122.278s">So</a>  the question should be split. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6126.039s">Yes,</a>  we can do it in two different questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6129.98s">First</a>  question, Mr. President, to create the fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6132.64s">So</a>  on the motion by Vice President Knight, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6138.122s">Move</a>  approval on the first question, seconded by second, second, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6141.523s">Council</a>  of bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6142.903s">Uh,</a>  Mr. Clerk, please call the roll council bears.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6322.38s">That's</a>  not something we're gonna take into account unless you reduce the line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6326.922s">We</a>  sent over as many possible answers that we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6331.584s">I</a>  know you've got some late today with regards to diversity and human resources, as well as the election coordinated position, which I know is two big sticking points. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6342.309s">So</a>  those two, we do wanna collaborate and we have split the two offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6349.509s">chief</a>  people officer with its own budget, as well as diversity office with their own budget.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6356.774s">My</a>  concern at this point is with the legal office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6359.556s">I</a>  know that we got a correspondence about the other stuff, but the question that I have pertains just to this particular request. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6365.62s">The</a>  request was that we recommend that the line be reduced and that the administration reallocate those funds voluntarily to the full-time or part-time salaries in the office, so that we would have an assistant city solicitor in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6377.188s">That</a>  was the question that was asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6380.05s">We</a>  recommended that the administration do this voluntarily, and we didn't receive a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6384.652s">If</a>  the response from the administration has now reduced the line item, then I'll offer that motion right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6389.314s">To</a>  reduce the line item.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6390.215s">My</a>  response is, you obviously can take that vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6392.736s">I'm</a>  asking you not to take that vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6394.536s">We</a>  have a city solicitor that has been, was acting for a very long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6400.799s">She</a>  is now the city solicitor for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6403.5s">We</a>  have Kopelman and Page, who we are working with a contract on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6410.394s">And</a>  they also are taking over all our negotiations with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6414.698s">It's</a>  a great price per month. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6416.479s">They</a>  have 45 experienced attorneys that are there for myself, the city and the council at any time, whether that be 5G, zoning, ordinances, they are amazing at what they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6431.91s">And</a>  they've been able to move the city forward faster than I've ever seen before. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6436.313s">And</a>  they're here to help the council as well, anytime.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6439.513s">It's</a>  very encouraging that we now hear that we have the ability to talk to Copeland and Page. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6442.956s">We've</a>  been asking for two years for draft ordinances to be sent to us, and they've taken an inordinate amount of time.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6448.7s">With</a>  that being said- If I may, every answer from City Solicitor Kim Scanlon comes to my office, and she does respond to every request from the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6458.927s">If</a>  there's more detail that you need, she's available, and if she wants to pass it on to Copeland and Page, or you would like her to, I'm sure she'd be amenable.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6469.882s">I'll</a>  just use an example of the short-term lodging ordinance that we asked for in January of 2020, and we still haven't received. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6478.424s">So</a>  we had to use Mr. Boborowski, our outside counsel, to provide that documentation to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6484.345s">I'm</a>  not going to go tip the tab, Mr. President, on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6487.346s">This</a>  is something the council's made a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6489.006s">We've</a>  asked for our own legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6490.286s">We've</a>  not been able to secure that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6492.987s">That's</a>  a line item that we've asked for in our budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6495.887s">I</a>  also made a case that we should have an assistant city solicitor in this community <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6500.346s">um,</a>  not outsourced. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6501.687s">Um,</a>  that's something that I feel very strongly about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6503.93s">Um,</a>  so with that being said, I'd make a motion right now for a council vote that contracted legal services line item 010151530200 be reduced in the amount of $81,600 president.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6520.205s">Uh,</a>  Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6521.686s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6522.827s">And</a>  I appreciate the mayor being here tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6525.367s">So</a>  Madam Mayor, the response that we received from the administration answering some of our questions, the request for 50,000 for legal services, some of us read it as we're not receiving it and others read it as we are receiving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6542.296s">So</a>  I was just wondering if you could clarify.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6544.977s">If</a>  there's a specific request, if you need to <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6548.705s">work</a>  on something specifically like we did suing the Board of Appeals, you will be provided the money, just like with your zoning consultant, you're provided 40,000 for that work, but just a blanket 50,000 for legal consultant for the council, I think that could create a conflict of interest because Solicitor Scanlon is our city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6570.841s">She</a>  works with the council, she works with the mayor's office, she works with the city and all department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6576.147s">So</a>  that being- Her opinion stands, so it could create a conflict, but if you needed money, just like you did for the zoning consultant, which we were happy to give you, and you've been working diligently on that, then we'll take it by case by case basis.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6590.499s">So</a>  that being said then, Copeland and Page, KP Law, seem to be additional legal counsel for the administration.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6600.287s">They're</a>  working as consultants with Kim,</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6605.633s">Right,</a>  but when Mr. Silverman was here, or Jonathan was here, I forget his last name, we asked him, who do you work for? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6612.874s">Do</a>  you work for the city council, the city of Metro, the city administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6615.975s">And</a>  he said, we work for the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6618.075s">That</a>  was his response.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6619.015s">So</a>  the only reason why I ask is I agree, the city solicitor is the law of the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6624.276s">And</a>  we actually have something before us that the city solicitor rendered an opinion, and the city administration is doubting the opinion of the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6634.228s">So,</a>  but right, but if we're talking about a potential conflict, then you have KP law, which is an outside entity, right?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6643.696s">Kim's</a>  the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6646.078s">So</a>  she, her decision rules, she gets backup from KP law.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6650.462s">Not</a>  according to your chief of staff, because he's debating on a question or an opinion that was issued by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6658.228s">And</a>  that was regarding the CAFs and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6661.406s">And</a>  it's still being debated now, I guess, that he's waiting for questions to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6666.39s">But</a>  that was a legal opinion issue by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6670.213s">So</a>  I'm just a little dumbfounded because the school committee has an attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6675.076s">And</a>  when I was on the school committee, we had an attorney we can go to as a school committee, but the council doesn't have any recourse regarding legal matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6684.303s">And</a>  there are times where there could be potential conflict of interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6688.826s">And</a>  we've had that in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6690.424s">I</a>  mean, we had an issue with billboards and we were on the council at the time, where the city solicitor was representing the administration and no one was representing the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6699.649s">So</a>  I think all this council is asking for is a line item in those particular circumstances where we feel that there may be a potential conflict, not to surpass the city solicitor, she does a tremendous job, but in times that we feel necessary that we have to have legal advice <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6719.796s">as</a>  a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6721.097s">And</a>  I really can't fathom why the city administration would feel so intimidated that, you know, we have legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6729.984s">And</a>  so no one's trying to circumvent. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6733.407s">Also,</a>  KP law was brought in at $60,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6737.931s">From</a>  what we found out in this budget process, they have billed us over $150,000 for this past fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6743.716s">So</a>  this great $5,000 a month <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6748.383s">No</a>  longer seems like a great $5,000 a month, because as was stated, that covers certain, you know, legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6758.205s">And</a>  I'm sure they've been requested by the city administration or other departments to assist in other things beyond that capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6764.946s">So</a>  now we're looking at 150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6765.746s">And</a>  as this council stated, we could probably put on an assistant city solicitor full time, as the office always existed, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6775.928s">There's</a>  always been as far as I remember, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6777.858s">There's</a>  always been a solicitor and assistant city solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6780.759s">And</a>  outside attorneys to handle workman's comp and engineering contracts and anything in energy and environment.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6788.821s">I</a>  don't doubt that, but it seems that KPLR is really now, I think they've issued, correct me if I'm wrong, they've actually issued legal opinions in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6798.883s">And</a>  correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember seeing them issue legal opinions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6802.364s">And</a>  the only one that can issue a legal opinion in this community is the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6807.22s">So</a>  I think they've been utilized in a way that really, if it's infringing on anyone, it has been on our law office and possibly substituting for our law office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6818.365s">So</a>  I would hope you just reconsider. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6820.986s">So</a>  this doesn't call for 50,000 line items in our budget for legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6826.469s">No,</a>  it does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6827.369s">Okay,</a>  so that was a major sticking point for me and it's been a major sticking point for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6833.412s">So</a>  just so you know, I thought, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6836.635s">we</a>  were getting the $50,000 for legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6841.257s">But</a>  at this point, I'll rest, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6847.479s">You</a>  know, the issue of this conflict of interest can be addressed very, very easily. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6852.961s">And</a>  it could be addressed very easily by recreating an assistant city solicitor position to the City Council in a part-time role. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6861.055s">that</a>  provides the council with the direction and advice and guidance that it's looking for in a confidential matter as their client, while also reporting to the city solicitor to be sure that it falls in line with the solicitor's opinions relative to legal questions and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6875.706s">So</a>  with that being said, that's why I offer the amendment, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6878.788s">That's</a>  why I offer the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6879.828s">I</a>  think it's a race to the bottom and we outsource every type of decision-making process in government. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6885.793s">We</a>  have no institutional knowledge, no control, no direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6889.295s">And</a>  that's why I offer the amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6890.988s">I</a>  offer the amendment to reduce the line item so that we can hire an assistant city solicitor in a part-time basis to represent this council on issues like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6897.092s">And</a>  that'll address the issues of conflict of interest because they'll report to the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6901.594s">There'll</a>  be our legal counsel that will provide us with confidential advice, but at the same time, they will report to the city solicitor and the city solicitor's opinions will control. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6909.259s">They</a>  won't be able to issue contradictory opinions because there'll be an employee in the solicitor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6913.682s">They'll</a>  just be assigned the task of working with the council.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6917.844s">But</a>  Councilor Knight, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6919.077s">You</a>  do get direction from Solicitor Scanlon, and if she needs backup, and when she needs backup, she'll, from a specialist, she'll go to KP Law.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6930.061s">Wait,</a>  was she Friday?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6932.622s">You</a>  had a solicitor here Friday.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6934.083s">You</a>  did?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6935.383s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, Mark Rumley served as the solicitor, the advisor, the resolution writer.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6942.446s">So</a>  he has the right to provide legal opinions now for the city of Medford?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6945.52s">You</a>  took his advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6947.582s">You</a>  took his advice.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6948.763s">So</a>  I'm just wondering why the solicitor, why we didn't have the solicitor present when we requested their presence.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6955.188s">The</a>  city solicitor was traveling on a vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6959.952s">She</a>  was not present. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6960.833s">I</a>  don't know if it was 48 hours in advance notice is sometimes not enough time for our department heads.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6966.937s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6967.558s">I'm</a>  glad that we're a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6969.7s">Councilor</a>  Best. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6970.861s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6971.601s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor, for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6974.14s">just</a>  two questions on the law department or one question one comment with the way that the budget is structured now, KP law will be reporting to Kim stand to the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6983.222s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6984.322s">And</a>  then I don't disagree with you councilor and on the principle of having in-house folks from the discussion I remember having with solicitor Stanley here, the issue was that there's not enough, but she feels like if she were to do it in the house, she would need two full-time city solicitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7001.587s">The</a>  81,000 is not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7003.787s">to</a>  hire two full-time solicitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7006.287s">And</a>  therefore she feels like in order to get the workload complete, this is the best arrangement of funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7011.148s">So</a>  that's what I heard from the solicitor herself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7013.989s">And</a>  I think that's what I'm gonna go with on this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7018.69s">That's</a>  just my position on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7020.33s">I</a>  definitely would hope that the administration and the solicitor's office, the law department would advocate to create a plan to have in-house, two in-house assistants to the solicitors or whatever amount of in-house staff is needed <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7034.053s">accomplish</a>  the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7035.133s">But</a>  I understand that that's not possible at the current time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7037.894s">So</a>  that's, that's where I am on this.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7040.075s">And</a>  I can appreciate I can appreciate them as the president at the end of the day, it's been a four year legislative priority for the council to attain legal counsel for the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7047.838s">It's</a>  been a four year legislative priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7049.678s">It's</a>  been put out as part of our council priorities during that time.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7055.36s">I</a>  may just point out there is case law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7057.621s">I</a>  know that the Boston City Council tried to get their own attorney and I believe <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7064.27s">Supreme</a>  Judicial Court stated they weren't able to, so proving the conflict of interest that would arise. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7073.472s">So</a>  I just, I have faith in our city solicitor, Kimberly Scanlon, to be able to advise the council and the city at the same time.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7081.053s">Mr.</a>  President, point of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7082.913s">Point</a>  of information, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7084.414s">With</a>  all due respect, it seems like the only one that's getting legal advice in the city is the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7090.075s">They</a>  get KP Law at their beck and call, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7093.453s">and</a>  they have the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7095.875s">So</a>  with all due respect, I think all we're doing is asking that when issues arise, that we need that same ability. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7105.463s">That's</a>  all we're asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7106.684s">No</a>  one's asking to cut out KP law, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7109.707s">And</a>  if there's a new fandango way of providing in-house legal services, that's better than how we've done it for years, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7118.371s">I</a>  want to listen to it, but we've always had a city solicitor and an assistant city solicitor since I've been on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7124.193s">I</a>  mean, so we're not asking to recreate the wheel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7127.834s">And</a>  I think what we're seeing now is the moving away from having an assistant city solicitor and the hiring of an outside company, which is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7135.996s">That's</a>  the mayor and the administration's prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7139.017s">And</a>  we're not looking to cut them out of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7142.238s">All</a>  we're saying is that we'd like to see how it's operated in the past with assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7148.115s">And</a>  that way we can have multiple legal opinions that actually trickle down to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7153.538s">Because</a>  I can just tell you, it's not happening now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7156.36s">When</a>  we have any type of legal question, we're not able to get answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7161.783s">Sometimes</a>  we are, but other times we're not, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7164.064s">So</a>  I think that's the concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7165.865s">And</a>  if there's some type of federal statute or state statute or whatever says that we can't do it, I'd like to see it and discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7174.87s">Because</a>  I'm not sure why we couldn't have <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7178.266s">legal</a>  advice, Mr. President, in-house legal advice that works with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7184.489s">That's</a>  all we're asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7185.129s">We're</a>  not asking to go outside of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7187.65s">We're</a>  not asking to do anything and having someone legally that, I mean, Kim Scanlon's one person, one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7194.573s">She</a>  works with every board and commission, every department, police, fire, DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7199.976s">I'm</a>  sure she gets questioned sometimes, even on the school side, even though they have their own lawyer that's been there for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7207.549s">So</a>  that's one city solicitor, and I agree, that's not enough for the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7212.591s">But</a>  I also rather see it in-house than outsourcing, and that figure keeps growing, the outsourcing figure, and I'd rather see it done in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7220.194s">That's</a>  all I'm saying, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7221.655s">Councilor</a>  Papantonio.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7222.975s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and thank you, Mayor Long and Clerk, for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7226.677s">I</a>  do agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7228.977s">I</a>  think I've always been a big supporter of having these services right here in City Hall, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7235.781s">with</a>  people that are familiar with that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7238.323s">I</a>  mean, I know KP Law has vast experience in different areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7241.144s">I</a>  understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7242.285s">But</a>  when I look at the way it's been set up in the past, we had a city solicitor, an assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7248.689s">They</a>  were extremely familiar with what was going on in the community, what projects were going on and the institutional knowledge that comes with working for a city for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7262.118s">And</a>  I think that's extremely valuable <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7264.584s">And</a>  I mean, I know myself, I like to see a city solicitor, assistant city solicitor, full-time jobs here in the law office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7273.07s">I</a>  look at the council now more than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7275.051s">You</a>  take a look at the last two years, three years, four years, go back and you take a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7280.134s">We</a>  are busier now, helping to draft ordinances and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7285.718s">And</a>  the solicitor's office has been very helpful without a doubt. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7289.36s">So</a>  I'm not saying that they haven't been, but there's a lot of demand <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7294.165s">for</a>  that one person to be at, like council member said, there's all kinds of meetings that that person needs to be at. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7301.069s">And</a>  I feel like we need legal help more than ever now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7304.471s">And</a>  if you take a look at what we did the discussions on the marijuana ordinance, we had KP law alien camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7310.675s">So</a>  it was almost like a duplication of efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7313.037s">So</a>  to me, it's like, I'd rather have city solicitors office with the city solicitor and at least the city assistant city solicitor that's helping us out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7321.842s">As</a>  far as the, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7324.036s">the</a>  line item for the legal services. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7326.117s">I</a>  think, you know, we should have an attorney that helps us out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7329.639s">You</a>  know, there's all kinds of questions that we had during our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7332.521s">And,</a>  you know, we usually don't have a city solicitor here to, you know, if we want to ask a question about anything in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7340.525s">It'd</a>  be good to have someone here in advance if we, you know, if we know something's coming up that night, that option would be great to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7347.629s">You</a>  know, the way I look at the way this is written here, and I appreciate the effort, but I feel like, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7353.65s">You</a>  know, if it's something that we think we need an attorney for, and maybe if you didn't agree with it, you'd say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7360.013s">And</a>  I feel like, you know, if we want an attorney for something, we should, as a body, we should be able to determine whether or not we needed an attorney for a certain situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7370.699s">That's</a>  the way I feel about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7371.719s">I'd</a>  love to see an extra person in the city solicitor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7375.742s">I</a>  think, you know, I look at what we're paying KP law now, and we're paying KP law now more than we pay camp. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7383.172s">And</a>  to me, that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7385.052s">That</a>  number keeps going up, and I think it's probably gonna go up over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7389.513s">And</a>  as we go get further, it's everything that's going on with the city, there's always legal things that come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7395.015s">And</a>  I think that that KP law demand is going to be more and more, and I'd rather see money put into the full-time employees here in the law office.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7404.697s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7406.337s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7406.657s">And</a>  let me know if I could ask a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7407.978s">Would</a>  it be possible <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7411.265s">through</a>  the KPLR agreement that the council be assigned an attorney to them.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7416.789s">I</a>  can bring that back to them and see if that's possible.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7419.351s">Is</a>  that something that the council would be able to do?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7422.533s">Or</a>  work something out with the solicitor that they come and represent the council on, depending on what issue it is.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7430.999s">Rather</a>  than have, I think that you'll have to call a different attorney every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7436.482s">If</a>  we could be assigned one particular attorney and let that attorney <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7440.883s">refer</a>  the questions around the KP of our office, rather than having us to maneuver around the KP law system. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7448.567s">That's</a>  something I can discuss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7450.568s">I</a>  can discuss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7452.329s">And</a>  if that would fall under the budget, that's already been created for KP law.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7457.691s">I</a>  can discuss that with KP law and Senator Scanlon.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7459.933s">I</a>  don't know how my other Councilors feel about that, if they want to offer an opinion on that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7466.196s">Well,</a>  I think it, and I appreciate the conundrum we're in, but like, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7470.92s">Like</a>  we said earlier, when we did ask KPLR a question, they specifically said they worked for the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7477.946s">So</a>  we truly did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7479.367s">And</a>  I think from that moment on, that's when we felt that we had no one else, especially when Kim, there was a question, like we said, during the cap question, when the city solicitor and I believe the finance director said that this isn't, they didn't think you could do that, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7499.614s">And</a>  the chief of staff said, well, he thinks they're wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7503.616s">So</a>  we were left in limbo. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7506.078s">And</a>  again, this brings up another question that we have in tonight's budget with the cap issue that's still left out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7514.743s">So</a>  that still needs to be answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7515.944s">So</a>  what we're seeing is an unbalanced process that's really <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7529.575s">hurting</a>  the whole process, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7530.956s">So</a>  I like, if that's possible, where we have legal representation from KP Law that that's spelled out, that we have a representative that we can reach. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7541.6s">And,</a>  you know, it's something simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7544.182s">You</a>  know, I try to reach Kim and she's very busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7546.803s">I</a>  don't have anybody else to ask because when we first had the question of, oh, we want to go to executive session, it was easy for us to call Howard and the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7559.123s">and</a>  say, Howard, I won't bring this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7560.324s">How</a>  does the process work? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7562.765s">And</a>  I didn't have that luxury a few months ago when we had that same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7570.869s">So</a>  it's something that simple because ultimately it makes us sort of look incompetent to our constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7578.673s">And</a>  I think that that's the biggest concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7580.514s">I</a>  think we need to have that partnership that I don't feel we have right now, which is tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7588.097s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7588.557s">Let</a>  me work on that because I didn't see the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7592.058s">I</a>  watched some, but I didn't see that meeting when John Silverstein said he represented the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7596.518s">And</a>  I'm just the possibility that he's the zoning attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7601.039s">So</a>  he's representing the city as it relates to defending, say, the 40 Bs and any zoning issues we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7607.62s">Otherwise,</a>  I know Janelle's been before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7612.001s">Attorney</a>  Robin is working on the 5G. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7615.142s">So</a>  they all have their niches, and I think they'd <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7617.564s">be</a>  willing to come to a council meeting, especially if you don't advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7621.567s">Oh,</a>  we need a zoning attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7622.807s">We</a>  need a workman's comp attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7625.569s">They</a>  would be willing to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7626.49s">And</a>  I think Kim, I think attorney Scanlon would agree to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7629.772s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7630.692s">So</a>  I'll talk to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7631.573s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7632.033s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7633.274s">Council</a>  member.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7634.735s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7635.455s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7635.595s">I</a>  would thank you, madam mayor for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7637.457s">I</a>  would, I'd agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7638.217s">I</a>  have like that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7638.918s">And</a>  I think as councilor Scarpelli is pointing out, it's part of it is just, we're not getting our needs met. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7644.161s">You</a>  know, sometimes it's just a quick question about what is the proper way to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7647.921s">And</a>  to your point about the different attorneys and KPO offer different areas, I'm not sure that's ever even been presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7654.283s">It's</a>  like, we'd go to a meeting and we'd see a new one there and be like, who are we getting tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7658.223s">So</a>  I think just understanding that would go a long way, but I really appreciate the idea of just, you know, someone dedicated to the council that can help us with, you know, just being above board, doing everything properly, because we hit on these new challenges all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7672.347s">And</a>  I think to the point of, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7673.755s">KP</a>  Law's experience, they have experience in these other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7676.276s">A</a>  lot of times the question is, you know, asking Attorney Scanlon, what have other communities drafted? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7681.619s">What</a>  are they doing in this area? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7682.859s">So</a>  it seems like something that they could assist with, but we're not getting that assistance right now.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7687.661s">Yeah,</a>  we can definitely work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7689.162s">I'm</a>  glad I came tonight to hear from you directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7693.744s">I</a>  think, yeah, there's at least 45 attorneys in that firm and like from Alicia, Director Hunt to Chief Buckley, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7702.074s">they</a>  each talk to their, depending on what their niches are, they taught and they are getting a lot of work done within these individual offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7708.356s">Tim</a>  McGivern is another department head that definitely works with a totally separate attorney than Chief Buckley would or Alicia Hunt would. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7716.079s">So</a>  yeah, they've been, they've been great. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7719.401s">And</a>  definitely, I think Solicitor Scanlon would agree to work on that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7728.104s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7728.864s">I</a>  was just going to say, I want to second what Councilor <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7731.602s">Council</a>  President Garabella said that having a direct line from us to KP Law, I think is the important thing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7738.086s">I</a>  understand what you're saying about having a consistent contact point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7741.188s">And</a>  if that person could then refer us to the bank of different specialties, I think that process I think is really valuable to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7749.614s">And</a>  again, my hope would be in the long run that we would transition back to a more in-house model. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7754.477s">If</a>  this is an acceptable transitional arrangement, I think that could be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7759.701s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7762.061s">I</a>  think the question was answered, but your original question, I thought you were looking for one attorney.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7767.942s">Well,</a>  one go-to person, and then that person could say, hey, call. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7772.683s">I'll</a>  refer you over to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7774.424s">But</a>  rather than just calling in a general person at a time, say, you know, attorney Smith is your contact, and you tell them your problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7782.105s">If</a>  they can't help you, they'll refer you to whatever person. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7786.366s">It's</a>  the same as you going to your GP doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7789.447s">You</a>  know, they treat you for small stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7791.573s">And</a>  they refer you out to whoever does whatever specialty you need.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7797.518s">And</a>  that's what happens now, out of respect for Solicitor Scanlon, a department head will say, I need somebody for protection of wetlands. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7806.344s">Attorney</a>  Scanlon will talk to somebody at KP Law and get the proper referral for whatever department head needs that attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7812.408s">So</a>  we can try to work out sort of the same scenario with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7817.921s">out</a>  of respect for solicitor Scanlon, she'll know everything that comes into the office and she's managing everything that's going on city council wise mayor's office and every other department within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7828.009s">But</a>  I'll throw up both ideas and we'll see what we can come up with.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7835.556s">So</a>  if a council comes up with a request, who's the gatekeeper of the request?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7842.91s">So</a>  the way the process goes now is the city clerk sends it up to my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7847.672s">I</a>  sign off and it referred to attorney Scanlon and then attorney Scanlon.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7852.033s">But</a>  if we have this new process now where we have KP law, just say they assigned Joe Smith to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7857.595s">And</a>  tomorrow the council says we want Joe Smith to look into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7860.837s">Does</a>  it require your approval?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7865.498s">I</a>  mean, I refer anything legal to the solicitors offers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7869.3s">I</a>  don't think there's anything.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7870.783s">held</a>  up, so.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7872.064s">That</a>  kind of defeats the whole purpose of what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7875.046s">I</a>  thought that we would have a direct contact rather than going through you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7879.489s">Like</a>  I say, like Councilman Mark says, tomorrow morning we get a question, we call up Attorney Smith.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7884.472s">You</a>  just contact Attorney Scanlon and say we have a resolution on the agenda for such and such an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7890.175s">Yeah,</a>  I will try to get it direct, but if it's a resolution, it comes to my office for sign off. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7895.358s">If</a>  it's a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7896.459s">But</a>  if you want to contact Attorney Scanlon like you would call her anyway, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7899.913s">and</a>  ask for a certain attorney at your meeting for July 19th, then we'll try to get you that attorney.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7906.498s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7907.379s">That</a>  wasn't what I was thinking.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7909.68s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7910.141s">I</a>  just want to make sure that we don't get into the circumstance where requests by this council are being denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7917.406s">Because</a>  that defeats the whole purpose.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7919.028s">I</a>  want you to get your ordinances written. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7920.669s">I've</a>  seen Attorney Scanlon send a number to my office that she's trying to work on.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7924.792s">But</a>  you see our point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7926.293s">We</a>  don't want to be contingent upon <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7929.48s">Will</a>  the mayor approve it or not? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7930.881s">You</a>  know, I don't think we should operate as a body that way, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7934.783s">So</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7936.383s">And</a>  I thought that's what the president was offering.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7938.224s">Sometimes</a>  a question can be answered with a phone call rather than make a free phone call to get the same thing.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7943.527s">Like</a>  I said, I think I said, we'll talk it through. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7946.548s">I'll</a>  talk it through with Solicitor Scanlon. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7948.209s">If</a>  you want to put the recommendation on the floor, I will try to work on it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7953.541s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7955.582s">Why</a>  don't we vote on the motion, and then if this passes, the mayor can come back with a plan, and then we can ask for supplemental spending to appropriate the funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7961.925s">I</a>  mean, there's no guarantees that we're going to get anything once we pass this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7966.146s">Once</a>  we vote on this budget, vote on this money, you know, it's going to go back to the coroner's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7969.828s">Then</a>  either it's going to happen or it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7971.669s">If</a>  it doesn't, what's our leverage? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7973.849s">So</a>  you want to vote on it? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7974.83s">I'm</a>  saying if we say, OK, we'll reduce the budget by this much, come back to us with the plan, ask us for the money to be reappropriated again in a supplemental spending packet, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7983.192s">we'll</a>  be happy to consider it provided that the council's brothers are met in terms of having a one point person point of contact that we can pick up and call and ask for legal advice that's gonna respond to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7995.556s">That</a>  would be my recommendation.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7999.458s">You're</a>  making that motion?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8000.218s">I</a>  made the motion to reduce. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8002.539s">I</a>  already made the motion to reduce.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8005.079s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8006.24s">I</a>  just wanna make sure if it's not often we do supplemental. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8009.421s">So</a>  maybe Felicia can advise us on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8013.182s">Alicia.</a> </p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8018.065s">Good</a>  evening, councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8019.126s">So</a>  you're asking if you can do add to the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8023.088s">Are</a>  you adding or are you asking about a 112 budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8026.25s">Are</a>  you specifically?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8028.231s">Vice</a>  President Knight mentioned, I don't think we want to add, we want to subtract.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8031.012s">What</a>  I'm saying is we have $81,000 in the contracted legal services line item. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8035.595s">I</a>  know that, you know, 20,000 of that's dedicated to labor services. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8038.757s">So</a>  I didn't be happy with the 60, moving the 60,000 out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8042.583s">and</a>  reducing the budget by $60,000 out of the contracted legal services line item until such time as we can negotiate what satisfies us for legal representation here as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8052.508s">And</a>  once we negotiate that, then you can come back to us for the additional $60,000 in the supplemental spending packet like you did earlier this fiscal year when you asked us to amend the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8061.292s">You</a>  could again come to us and ask us to amend the budget after we negotiate what's gonna work for us with KP Law and legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8067.475s">We</a>  could reduce the budget now by the 60,000, which is the amount of the KP Law contract <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8071.659s">We</a>  could sit down and we could come up with an agreement that would, you know, satisfy the brothers of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8076.523s">And</a>  then once we reach that agreement, the administration can present to us a supplemental spending paper that asks us to increase the budget by that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8083.948s">But</a>  at that point, we'll be able to get our legal counsel.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8088.031s">You</a>  could cut, you could cut the 60,000, but it would be up to the mayor to provide you with a supplemental if she so chooses.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8100.081s">So</a>  that would be the request. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8101.301s">Reduce</a>  the budget right now by the $60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8104.462s">Negotiate</a>  the idea with KP Law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8107.643s">We're</a>  going to reduce it by 60,000 until we have the opportunity to have a legal counsel that's going to meet our needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8113.084s">It's</a>  been a priority for this council for how many years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8116.965s">I</a>  think the mayor is making a commitment now that she's willing to work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8119.666s">So</a>  why don't we let her get to work on that and then we can appropriate the funds once we have an agreement.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8124.647s">Let</a>  me get to work on that without cutting the budget and us having to do a supplemental</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8129.676s">$60,000.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8129.736s">I</a>  mean, you could print rebel stamps for us too. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8133.517s">But</a>  at the end of the day, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8135.398s">There's</a>  some needs and desires.</p>
