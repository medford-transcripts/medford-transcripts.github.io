    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=0.993s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3.313s">26th</a>  regular meeting of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6.134s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=7.514s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8.054s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=8.814s">Councilor</a>  Thompson. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=9.555s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10.135s">Vice</a>  President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=10.815s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=11.235s">Councilor</a>  Martins. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12.055s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=12.655s">Councilor</a>  Morell.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14.075s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=14.855s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=15.296s">President</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=16.936s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=17.756s">Please</a>  rise and assume the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=19.236s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=31.675s">Before</a>  we start the meeting tonight, tonight's the last night for our TV station manager, Pat Gordon. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=43.519s">And</a>  Pat, we just want to thank you for your service for all the years and the time it's ours. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=49.861s">So</a>  congratulations and good luck on your new position. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=55.482s">Councilor</a>  Marksley, do you want to?</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=56.883s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=57.844s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=60.246s">Patrick</a>  Gordon has been an instrumental part of this team since he came on with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=66.892s">And</a>  in particular, Mr. President, over the 18 or so months of the pandemic, Patrick was the one that brought us into the 21st century, allowing us to communicate with our constituents that were unable to attend meetings during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=82.88s">And</a>  he was instrumental in bringing up Zoom for us, not only for the council meeting, but many other public meetings in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=90.904s">And</a>  I credit him, actually, for having us keep open government during the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=98.447s">And</a>  I wish him well in his new endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=101.088s">And</a>  hopefully, at some point, we'll see him again, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=105.955s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=107.436s">I</a>  mean, I'm scared to say nice things because I don't want to see you go, but yeah, to echo Councilor Marks, just the work you always do is tremendous, but the work you did, particularly during the pandemic to get us dialed in from home in the chambers, allowing the public to engage, you know, doing that with your own equipment and really kind of bootstrapping to get this a really successful system, I think speaks volumes to just how you operate and have operated since you've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=129.489s">So</a>  you will be sorely missed and I thank you for your years of just excellent service to the city and to the council.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=136.306s">Councilor</a>  Tocco.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=137.346s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=138.307s">Thank</a>  you so much for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=140.987s">Last</a>  year when I was president, we were going through this together and I called you on a regular basis just to make sure that all the technology was working fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=149.95s">And</a>  we made that transition from Zoom back into the council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=155.632s">You</a>  were instrumental, be humble, leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=158.493s">I</a>  know it took you many hours to test everything out and to get it working. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=163.652s">it</a>  was, it was seamless. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=164.733s">We</a>  came back, you had everything going, everything working absolutely to perfection. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=169.795s">And</a>  I can't thank you enough for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=171.555s">And</a>  for all of the hours that you've put in in the past year, year and a half, I know you've been working nonstop, not just with our meetings, but with all of the municipal meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=181.279s">So</a>  thank you so much for all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=183.7s">Congratulations,</a>  good luck, best wishes, and thank you for all your hard work.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=188.262s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=190.724s">Pat,</a>  I'm going to be very sad to see you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=192.465s">We've</a>  had a lot of laughs over the past couple of years, and I'm very grateful that you came and took over TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=200.61s">It's</a>  been quite a run for you, brother. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=202.071s">You've</a>  put in a ton of hours, overworked and underpaid, and I'm very sad to see you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=206.114s">You've</a>  done an excellent job for us here at MedFed, and you've really helped bring us to the 21st century, so thank you very much for all you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=211.697s">I</a>  wish you the best of luck over in Everett, and I hope you don't recommend them to steal anybody else from us over here.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=219.018s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=220.039s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President and Patrick. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=222.621s">I</a>  mean, I don't think we can say enough about how far above and beyond you've gone in your entire service, you know, running community media for an entire community by yourself, you know, up until just a few months ago, I think, and what you've done for us in the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=237.774s">And</a>  personally, I can't thank you enough for making me look good on camera. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=241.977s">So</a>  I really look forward to seeing what you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=245.642s">and</a>  hopefully building a budget that could attract someone like you back here in the future.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=251.584s">Uh,</a>  Pat, uh, this is, uh, it's bittersweet because, uh, you know, you went through a tough time with all of us and, uh, it was your leadership that pulled us through. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=262.488s">So</a>  I don't think people realize how much you did do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=265.649s">Um,</a>  I know that <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=267.334s">when</a>  you're talking about a position where it takes you away from your family, you, you know, you, you see some people get bitter and angry. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=274.741s">I've</a>  never, ever saw that in you at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=277.183s">Um,</a>  I'd see you on a Tuesday after a marathon session, the school committee, and then thinking that we have a marathon session on Tuesday and thinking your week's done, but no, you have to do another committee meeting on a Wednesday and you're a one man team. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=291.136s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=292.677s">No</a>  wonder why other communities came in and tried to scoop you up and why you're leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=297.2s">So</a>  it hurts that you are leaving, but, you know, you took a lot of junk from a lot of ignorant people that you had to deal with and listen to that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=308.189s">But</a>  I just warned you, yeah, we had the flyby, it was supposed to start, and then the flyby. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=316.475s">So</a>  all I want to, let it be saying that, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=319.377s">Thank</a>  you, congratulations for all your hard work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=322.118s">It's</a>  something that you set Medford on a great track. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=325.838s">The</a>  award you received, I think, is something we'll never forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=330.059s">Thanks</a>  to you, and have a great time in the neighboring community.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=334.28s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=335.56s">Again,</a>  on behalf of all my colleagues and everyone at the City of Medford, thank you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=340.621s">During</a>  some tough times, you kept us together and kept the show on the road again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=344.362s">Good</a>  luck in your new position, and hopefully we can hire so many <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=348.88s">of</a>  equal talent of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=350.141s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=352.543s">Just</a>  just if I could customize on I've stated this on many occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=356.707s">The</a>  city of method charges a 5% fee on cable bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=361.685s">And</a>  that 5% fee is a franchise fee that's supposed to go to PEG access, which is public education and government channel. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=370.494s">Only</a>  2% of the fee goes back into providing local programs, educational programs, and government access, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=378.903s">The</a>  rest, the 3%, goes into the general office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=382.325s">And</a>  I think what we're seeing, Mr. President, this has nothing to do with Patrick, what we're seeing is a sorely underfunded PEG local access station, you know, not similar to other communities that have a large office with multiple employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=397.073s">But</a>  here we are with one employee and an assistant, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=401.882s">which</a>  just is not enough to run a peg access in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=405.484s">So</a>  I respectfully ask once again, that this be looked at by the city administration and fully fund peg access. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=414.09s">So</a>  the residents can reap the benefits, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=416.891s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=419.133s">I</a>  want to admit that I just came tonight because I thought we were getting fed again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=424.396s">It's</a>  not a budget meeting, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=429.123s">It's</a>  been an absolute pleasure working with all of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=431.486s">Um,</a>  there's obviously differences in politics and opinions, but it's quite obvious that you all have this city's best interest in mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=438.513s">And</a>  it's, it's pretty clear every week seeing that, you know, work play itself out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=442.176s">So</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=443.738s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=444.058s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=444.599s">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=444.959s">Good</a>  luck.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=445.48s">Hey,</a>  uh, vice president night.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=451.157s">A</a>  motion to suspend the rules to take several papers out of order, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=454.521s">On</a>  the motion by Vice President Knight to take papers out of order, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=458.825s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=459.927s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=460.227s">Opposed?</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=460.748s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=462.069s">Paper</a>  21431, Mr. President, a common victuals license. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=466.754s">Which</a>  one was it? 21431.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=473.522s">2-1,</a>  petitions, presentations and similar papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=477.486s">2-1-4-3-1,</a>  petition for a common fixture license for Calwind Management doing business as Town Place Suites slash Fairfield Inn Suites, 85 Station Landing, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=489.796s">Do</a>  we have anybody from Calwind Management here on the call? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=499.705s">Anybody</a>  from Calwind Management on the call? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=505.916s">Maria</a>  Costa, Marcy Costa, where are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=509.359s">Marcy</a>  Costa, as a clerk, can you unmute Marcy, please?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=519.146s">Can</a>  you all hear me?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=520.628s">Yes,</a>  Marcy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=521.428s">Are</a>  you here representing town, please?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=525.652s">I</a>  am, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=526.572s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=526.893s">Marcy</a>  Costa from McDermott, Colty, and Miller at 28 State Street in Boston, Massachusetts, on behalf of the applicant.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=533.518s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=534.651s">Licensing</a>  Chairman, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=537.313s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=538.994s">Now,</a>  this is for a petition for a conflict license at Stacey's Landing for Tower Place Suites, Fairfax. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=553.304s">Mr.</a>  President, do any of my colleagues have any comments or questions before I recommend approval?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=560.532s">Vice</a>  President, a couple things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=562.273s">First</a>  of all, Mr. President review of the application. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=564.354s">It</a>  appears that this entity has the ability to employ over 100 full of part time employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=569.456s">So</a>  this seems like this will be something that's a great addition to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=572.878s">However,</a>  in looking at the application, the petition does seek hours from six a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=577.14s">to</a>  one a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=578.18s">And</a>  that would, I believe, require them to petition this council at a later date for an extended hours permit.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=583.443s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=587.315s">The</a>  11 o'clock would be the latest closing time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=591.178s">Under</a>  the current permit, you'd have to come back for a special permit for extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=596.882s">7</a>  to 11, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=598.303s">Yeah,</a>  the normal permit is 7 to 11.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=818.084s">One</a>  at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=819.004s">Okay,</a>  21432 to President Caraviello and all honorable members of the Medford City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=822.626s">Mr.</a>  President, members of the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=824.516s">I</a>  respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body, pursuant to provisions of General Law, Chapter 40, Section 3, approve and authorize the grant of an easement to Tufts University, extending its perpetual exclusive right in, under, on, and over the easement area for the purpose of maintaining and utilizing the plaza for access to the new Cummings Center building being constructed on Tufts property <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=852.562s">for</a>  access to other parts of the Tufts campus, for a seating area, a gathering place, and for a university activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=860.403s">The</a>  easement will allow Tufts to construct a system to provide for telecommunications, distribution cables, and to serve campus needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=869.865s">For</a>  your information, I am submitting a copy of the document containing the strength of easement along with the plan setting forth the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=877.266s">Representatives</a>  from Tufts will be in attendance at the council meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=881.348s">to</a>  answer questions, especially submitted on Mayor Graham of the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=886.131s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. Abruzzi, are you here from Tufts University? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=890.754s">Mr.</a>  Clark, can you unmute Mr. Abruzzi? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=899.5s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=901.782s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=902.982s">Robert</a>  Abruzzi. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=904.755s">Attorney</a>  here on behalf of Tufts University with me is also Rocco DiRico and Ruthie Bennett from the university, the project director. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=914.299s">So</a>  we're here tonight seeking the council's approval of an easement in connection with the university's Cummings Center project on College Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=924.284s">More</a>  specifically, the grant of this easement will allow for a more aesthetically pleasing transition between the <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=934.955s">Plaza,</a>  which is in front of the coming center and the College Avenue sidewalk below. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=941.585s">As</a>  you know, there's a quite a great gradient variation in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=950.564s">The</a>  limits and the boundaries of the easement were worked out in conjunction with the university consultation with the engineering department of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=960.933s">And</a>  the easement document itself has been approved by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=967.219s">So</a>  at this point, I'll turn it over to Ruthie Bennett who will detail for the council's benefit a little bit more information about the easement request.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=977.027s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=978.827s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you could unmute Ruthie Bennett. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=985.652s">Good</a>  evening, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=986.152s">Bennett.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=986.472s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=988.434s">Sure,</a>  Ruthie Bennett, Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=992.336s">Thank</a>  you very much for letting me present this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=995.118s">So</a>  first of all, of course, I've been on Zoom for 15 months, and tonight my internet is unstable, so I'm going to try to get through the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1002.883s">Is</a>  there a way that I could share my screen to show you some of the drawings? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1006.526s">Is</a>  that possible?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1007.186s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, can you yell? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1009.29s">One</a>  second, the clerk will take care of that for you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1011.791s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1013.111s">Just</a>  let me know when I should try to do that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1015.112s">Okay,</a>  Ruthie, you're all set.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1021.354s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1021.974s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1024.855s">So</a>  hopefully you're seeing my screen now, which is a drawing of the building.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1029.137s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1030.724s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1031.344s">So</a>  I just want to orient the council for a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1034.825s">So</a>  basically, this is College Avenue on the bottom of the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1039.686s">These</a>  are the MBTA tracks and Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1044.148s">And</a>  this is the Cummings building on our site. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1049.389s">This</a>  is the plaza in front of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1051.509s">This</a>  is the main entrance to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1054.262s">This</a>  is the sidewalk that we were talking about that slopes up College Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1058.623s">This</a>  is the pedestrian bridge that the MBTA has just put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1062.544s">And</a>  this is the cafe that's open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1067.745s">This</a>  is the easement, this strip of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1070.125s">It's</a>  about 1,100, 1,200 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1071.225s">You</a>  can see it's about 9 1⁄2 feet here, 7 1⁄2 feet here, and it's about 150 feet long. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1080.209s">And</a>  let me show you what the easement is in a rendering, because it's hard to understand what we're really talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1085.134s">So</a>  basically this is the Cummings building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1087.976s">And</a>  as you know, the sidewalk here slopes, it's about a five to six foot slope from the bottom over here, all the way up to the pedestrian bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1096.845s">And</a>  it was very important for us to have an accessible connection from the sidewalk to the main entrance of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1103.199s">So</a>  the plaza, of course, is flat and the sidewalk is sloping up in this direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1109.306s">But</a>  right here, there is an accessible connection from the sidewalk into the main entrance of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1117.075s">In</a>  this blue area here, this is approximately, this is my rough drawing, but approximately the easement area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1124.333s">So</a>  this is the courtyard, the plaza for the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1128.035s">These</a>  are the steps going up, the flat plaza, and then steps up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1132.638s">And</a>  if we didn't have this easement, there would be a flat courtyard, flat plaza, and then there would be this drop, basically a drop from here down to six feet to get to the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1146.126s">And</a>  there would be a wall about six feet, and then going down to this accessible entrance, and then the wall would continue again. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1153.858s">So</a>  in working with the engineering department, what we proposed and they thought was a good idea was to have, instead of having a wall here, we would have this landscaping, basically, instead of a retaining wall, this is a sloped area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1170.79s">So</a>  all of this green that you see is basically sloping from the courtyard down to the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1177.935s">And</a>  then here it starts to slope up to meet the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1182.248s">So</a>  what we're really asking for is an easement to have some basically grassy area and some xeriscaping, so drought-resistant plants. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1191.435s">This</a>  is the accessible connection. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1193.136s">So</a>  this part of the sidewalk that's in this part of the plaza that's accessible is on city land. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1198.6s">The</a>  same thing here, basically grass and some xeriscaping. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1203.244s">Oh,</a>  well, there's just kind of a slope that you walk next to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1207.307s">It's</a>  a much nicer pedestrian experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1211.291s">This</a>  is a picture of before the project happened, this is basically the slope that happens at the site between the sidewalk and the site, as you know that sidewalk going up here is really steep, and then the site itself kind of dropped off. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1224.308s">We're</a>  really trying to make it a situation where it's nice for pedestrians. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1227.89s">There's</a>  my internet connections unstable, but where they're basically walking next to, like I said, kind of a landscaped area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1235.415s">We're</a>  not going to build anything else on this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1237.497s">It's</a>  just landscape. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1238.518s">We</a>  will maintain snow removal, trash removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1242.3s">This</a>  will always be an open, accessible connection from the sidewalk to the front of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1250.553s">We</a>  can take any questions if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1252.273s">And</a>  again, if my internet goes out, then I think Rocco and Mr. Abruzzese can respond, but I'd be happy to take questions.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1259.095s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1259.475s">I'll</a>  assume that that makes the plaza handicap accessible.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1265.857s">Yes,</a>  exactly right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1266.878s">This</a>  is a handicap accessible connection from the sidewalk to the building, the whole plaza and the cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1272.379s">So</a>  yes, this is all accessible from the sidewalk right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1276.0s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1962.531s">Mr.</a>  Kavanaugh, Mr. President, was a gentleman who was also a member of the Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk's Elk <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1982.023s">picked</a>  up the torch where he left off in her efforts in volunteering in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1986.507s">We</a>  all know Carrie from Channel 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1988.328s">She</a>  hosted last year's mayoral debate as a matter of fact, two years ago, the mayoral debate as a matter of fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1993.933s">But</a>  Paul was just a great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=1996.174s">His</a>  wife was a school teacher and they met through public schools for a number of years, and they're really some people that have given a lot to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2002.239s">And</a>  Paul had a very public battle with cancer and he succumbed to the effects <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2007.116s">thereof,</a>  and he'll be sorely missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2009.318s">So</a>  with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2012.48s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2014.101s">So</a>  on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2019.645s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2022.167s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2022.867s">Please</a>  rise for a moment of silence. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2039.51s">2-1,</a>  4-2-6, offered by Council Marks, being resolved that Teresa Castagnetti, lead teacher coach in the English Learners Department for the Medford Public School be recognized for a 45 year commitment and leadership to the students of Medford on a recent retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2056.461s">Council</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2057.561s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2058.842s">It's</a>  my honor to stand before this council and the residents of this community to honor one of Medford's finest, Mr. President, Teresa Castagnetti, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2068.797s">I</a>  think we all, behind this reel, know Teresa. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2072.818s">Teresa</a>  was an advocate for our students, serving as the lead teacher and coach for the English Learners Department for many decades, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2083.621s">Teresa</a>  had a career that was remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2087.262s">She</a>  always stood up for what she believed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2089.623s">Even</a>  recently, as of last year, Mr. President, when the condition of the sidewalks and the curbing and the road into the McGlynn <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2098.375s">and</a>  Andrews Middle School was in poor condition and caused trip and hazards for parents, children, and faculty, Teresa was the first one to step forward and kept on stepping forward, bringing this council up to date on the needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2116.768s">And</a>  it was Teresa Castagnetti that I largely credit for making those things happen within that area, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2126.787s">Teresa</a>  worked in the Kids' Corner daycare as executive board chairperson and secretary from 1992 to 95. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2135.293s">So</a>  in addition to her duties as a lead teacher, she also found the time to work in the Kids' Corner daycare as an executive member, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2145.419s">Back</a>  in 2015, annual state award given to a teacher who exemplifies excellence in the education of English language learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2154.833s">through</a>  evidence of best instructional practices, long-term commitment to the education of ELLS, leadership roles at the school's district, level of behalf of the ELLs, mentoring of new ELL teachers through formal induction programs, and strong relationships to parents of ELLs in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2178.479s">So</a>  back in 2015, Teresa received the Distinguished Award <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2184.053s">Teacher</a>  of the Year, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2185.874s">It's</a>  a statewide award, and believe me, they were able to recognize the merits of Teresa Castagnetti and her accomplishments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2196.741s">Teresa</a>  served as the ELE teacher for the Medford Public Schools from 2016 to 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2201.564s">Teresa</a>  was a mentor teacher for the Medford Public Schools from 2001 to 2021, over 20 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2212.89s">She</a>  was a supervising practitioner for several general education teachers and Lesley University graduate students to complete their 150-hour internship towards ESL licensure. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2225.535s">And</a>  from 2008 to 2014, Teresa was selected by DESE to participate on several DESE panels and committees for assessment and development standard settings for the Statewide Language Proficiency Exam and train the trainer cohorts <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2242.846s">and</a>  second language learning and teaching, in which Teresa, in turn, provided professional development for the district, right here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2252.55s">Teresa</a>  also served as co-chairperson for the McGlynn Elementary School literacy team. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2257.892s">And</a>  in 2008, 2009, Teresa co-chaired the creation of the district's first school-based literacy team, which established uniform K through five literacy assessment protocols. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2270.096s">and</a>  a building-wide K-5 literacy action plan for the McGlynn Elementary School, which was adopted as a model for the district, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2279.122s">I</a>  can only say, Mr. President, that knowing Theresa over the years, knowing her professionalism, the way she dealt with her colleagues, the way she dealt with parents, faculty, students, I think goes unmatched in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2296.574s">And</a>  it's only appropriate that <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2298.365s">I</a>  rise here today thanking her for her 45 years of commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2302.127s">I</a>  would ask that Teresa receive a council accommodation for her years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2306.788s">And</a>  I also want to thank her, Mr. President, for putting up with Andrew Castagnetti, her lovely husband for many years, Mr. President, who we all know and love as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2321.194s">And</a>  I just want to thank Teresa and wish her well on her retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2324.596s">And</a>  I'm sure we're going to see her around the community, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2363.329s">Oh,</a>  Scott. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2364.249s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2364.97s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Markswell and members of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2366.811s">I</a>  had the privilege and honor of working with Teresa at the Osgoode School and then the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2373.455s">And</a>  one thing you realize as a young teacher, you look for role models to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2380.819s">And</a>  Teresa was that role model. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2383.44s">I</a>  think that we focused as young teachers <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2386.868s">to</a>  make sure you look at the intangibles. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2389.509s">And</a>  what we learned from Teresa is her passion for the children, every single one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2393.95s">So</a>  she was a true advocate for all of her kids and for our teachers that were at times going through contract negotiations and the nerves that are felt with non-tenured professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2412.274s">And</a>  she was a rock that <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2415.812s">kept</a>  a lot of young teachers together. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2418.534s">And</a>  she was a great role model. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2420.855s">So</a>  as a friend and a former colleague, I want to congratulate her. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2425.377s">I</a>  actually thought she would never retire. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2428.639s">And</a>  but it's, it's it's it's sad because I think she still has another 45 years in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2434.162s">So</a>  I appreciate it and wish her luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2437.444s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2440.366s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2442.127s">One</a>  thing that's always amazed me about Teresa was <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2445.593s">The</a>  passion that she had for the job, she never lost that passion and love for the job, even after, you know, four and a half decades of teaching, she was still coming up there advocating for the students when the easy thing to do after four and a half decades of teaching would be to say, oh, the next generation is going to take care of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2460.84s">She's</a>  someone that certainly led by example, put her money where her mouth is, and was always out here working on behalf of the children in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2467.583s">So</a>  it's something <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2468.853s">that</a>  I think is very grateful, that I'm very grateful for Mr. President, the effort and energy that she put forth, how she went above and beyond to do some of the things that she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2477.379s">And</a>  I want her to enjoy her retirement as best as she possibly can in the lovely neighborhood of East Method.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2488.787s">We</a>  can keep going, but it's not televised. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2493.49s">Are</a>  we still televised?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2496.912s">Give</a>  it a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2499.308s">If</a>  we could hold on one second, a little power search here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2502.491s">Curiously,</a>  the main plug the whole city.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2583.703s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2584.703s">I</a>  want to thank you for co-sponsoring this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2587.364s">Here</a>  we are once again, Mr. President, another faculty member within our public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2594.465s">42</a>  years of dedication to the students, the parents, and to our Medford public school system, I think is something that really deserves recognition, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2607.047s">Cheryl</a>  Mayarco is a well-respected employee of the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2611.873s">in</a>  the special ed department, who dedicated over 42 years of service to our most vulnerable students. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2619.235s">Cheryl</a>  started a career in method as a substitute teacher and instructional aid in 1978. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2626.857s">Cheryl</a>  became a special education teacher in 1980. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2631.358s">For</a>  the past 20 years, Cheryl has worked tirelessly as an evaluation team leader, providing mentoring and guidance to newer ETLs <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2641.838s">and</a>  staff members. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2643.758s">Cheryl</a>  was passionate about the Children of Method, acting as a strong advocate for student needs and making personal connections with every student she assisted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2656.22s">Cheryl</a>  was dedicated to caring for the whole child, communicating with parents, caregivers, and educational team members. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2664.722s">Cheryl</a>  was always expanding her knowledge and her expertise to be prepared and responsive to families and students <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2671.93s">of</a>  method. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2673.992s">Colleagues</a>  and families remarked that Cheryl went over and above in assisting families and students with patience, positive attitude, and a caring nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2685.38s">And</a>  for all of us that know Cheryl, Mr. President, know these words are completely true. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2692.285s">Cheryl</a>  gave everything she could to her job. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2695.427s">She</a>  liked what she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2697.629s">She</a>  excelled what she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2699.886s">And</a>  she really made, I think, a lot of strides in the special ed department. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2706.852s">She</a>  was someone that you can count on to make sure that if services were needed for a child, Cheryl would fight for the student. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2714.378s">You</a>  didn't need to hire an outside advocate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2716.6s">It</a>  was Cheryl Mayorko that would step up and make sure that each and every child received the proper services, Mr. President, for their education. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2726.809s">And</a>  parents respected that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2729.104s">um,</a>  in our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2730.845s">Uh,</a>  you know, the my uncle couple, which I refer to as Cheryl, my uncle and Robert, my uncle, who served on this body for over three decades, um, and the capacity of council president is and as a member of this body, uh, they were a power couple in this community, Mr. President, for many decades, and both were well respected and leaders in this community, and they continue to be leaders in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2757.224s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2758.242s">I</a>  would personally like to ask Mr. President that Cheryl Mayarco receive a council accommodation for her 42 years of dedicated service to our students, our most vulnerable students, parents, faculty, and the entire community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=2777.428s">I</a>  would like to thank her.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3018.27s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3019.67s">This</a>  was an item that was put on the agenda last week under public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3024.912s">And</a>  we had a number of residents that came up to speak on their concerns regarding the now, I guess, resolved issue of the naming of the Columbus School. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3035.796s">That</a>  was somewhat of a lengthy process that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3039.618s">I</a>  believe there was much division in the community over this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3044.12s">Many</a>  people felt that they weren't heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3047.282s">Many</a>  people felt that they weren't part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3050.283s">And</a>  what I'm offering here tonight, Mr. President, is that we take a closer look at the naming of any building in the community, whether it's on the school side or the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3063.369s">As</a>  a member of the school committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3065.337s">I</a>  can attest to you firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3067.598s">I</a>  actually am one of the members that actually voted against the naming of one of our schools back some 20 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3077.261s">And</a>  it wasn't because I was opposed to the name, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3080.502s">It</a>  was more of a process issue I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3083.383s">And</a>  at the time, I felt there wasn't enough public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3086.685s">There</a>  wasn't enough community participation in regards to the selection of the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3091.326s">And</a>  therefore, I actually voted against <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3093.951s">the</a>  naming of one of our, what we refer to as new schools now that are 20 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3099.736s">I</a>  would say, Mr. President, that in a community of this size, when you're talking about naming a school building, and know that many of these buildings, whether it's a municipal building, or a park, or the corner of an intersection that's named, this has personal memories to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3119.573s">It</a>  has personal feelings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3122.91s">And</a>  I think we have to be very mindful of that when we have a process to look at the renaming. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3129.832s">I'm</a>  not opposed to renaming. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3131.533s">I'm</a>  not opposed to looking at things in retrospect, but what I am opposed to Mr. President is a process where people feel left out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3141.755s">And</a>  if one person feels left out, that's enough for me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3146.377s">And</a>  I'm respectfully asking that we ask our city solicitor <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3151.292s">I</a>  don't doubt for a second that the school committee has the authority to name a building, and I've told people that over the past year and a half, that they have the ability to name a building. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3161.719s">All</a>  I'm asking is whether or not the Medford City Council, through way of an ordinance, can create a policy, Mr. President, that includes the entire community when it comes to looking at municipal or school-owned buildings, and that we create <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3179.8s">a</a>  policy and procedure that ultimately has the goal of incorporating every comment, every person's wishes, and coming out with a process that we can all feel proud of at the end and not have the division that we're seeing right now, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3198.614s">And</a>  that's all this is trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3200.856s">This</a>  is not trying to take away anyone's responsibilities, anyone's duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3205.719s">It's</a>  seeing a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3207.821s">When</a>  I see a community divided, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3209.794s">That</a>  concerns me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3210.495s">I've</a>  been around a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3212.336s">And</a>  when I see a community divided over an issue, we as legislators, the executive branch, I think have to step up and say, how do we better this process? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3222.184s">How</a>  do we make it so we don't have to go through this every time we may decide that we want to rename something? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3228.69s">And</a>  I feel that if this process continues in the manner it's going, all it's going to do is create division. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3236.756s">And</a>  that would include on the municipal side. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3239.446s">So</a>  I'm not saying this is strictly a school issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3242.167s">It's</a>  on the municipal side as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3243.508s">So</a>  I'm saying, open up the process to the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3247.109s">And</a>  those are my comments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3248.89s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3251.751s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3253.072s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3255.993s">I</a>  certainly don't disagree that a standard process and procedure that would allow for, you know, the renaming of any municipal facility or building or <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3267.71s">I</a>  think we might even want to outline everything we mean here because he meant in corners and streets and that kind of thing would be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3274.613s">My</a>  only concern goes back to what you were saying about who has the authority around school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3280.515s">I</a>  think I could support this if we didn't include the school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3283.757s">And</a>  I think whatever we come up with for the city side could easily be taken up as a model by the school committee to use for school facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3289.839s">I</a>  just have concerns around the legal authority as outlined and I wouldn't want <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3295.485s">I</a>  wouldn't want the city solicitor to come back and say, well, you don't have the authority around school buildings, X, Y, Z. So that's my main concern here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3302.107s">Other</a>  than that, I agree that having a strong process with clear outcomes, certainly, hopefully we'll bring at least more people together. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3310.809s">I</a>  don't know if we're ever going to get everyone to agree to every renaming, but I think it's important that we try. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3315.11s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3315.89s">So,</a>  Mr. President, I appreciate those comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3319.031s">And</a>  I would only state that what I'm trying to do through this resolution <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3323.679s">is</a>  ask our chief legal officer, who is attorney Kim Scanlon, whether or not we first of all have the jurisdiction and authority to create an ordinance that would cover a separate body. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3336.045s">The</a>  school committee is a separate body. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3337.425s">They're</a>  an autonomous body. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3339.006s">And</a>  I understand the boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3341.667s">However,</a>  we are the legislative body for the entire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3345.069s">And</a>  the school committee falls under the purview of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3349.911s">And</a>  if the <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3352.171s">solicitor</a>  came back and said, I don't believe that you can do that as a council through way of ordinance, to me, then the issue would be dropped by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3360.194s">I'm</a>  not gonna pursue anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3362.375s">But</a>  if the city solicitor came back and said, indeed, you have the ability to do that, I think that would call for a subcommittee or committee of the whole, maybe even a joint meeting with the school committee and the administration to discuss next steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3375.399s">But</a>  all I'm doing is asking what our options are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3380.454s">and</a>  not forcing anything on anyone at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3383.955s">So</a>  that's all I wanna get across, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3389.937s">Perhaps</a>  can we ask two questions instead of one then? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3394.158s">Could</a>  the city ask the city solicitor for a ruling on whether the council through ordinance can craft a process for the naming of a school building? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3402.02s">And</a>  then maybe the second one could be a further resolve that the city council ask the city solicitor for <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3408.554s">an</a>  example of a process for the naming of any municipal building or facility, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3413.897s">I</a>  just wanna make sure we ask both questions so we get an answer on each of them.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3421.923s">The</a>  way that I'm reading this is no more than the councilor asking a question as to whether or not the Medford city council is a legal authority to establish and define a process to be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3430.208s">It's</a>  not in from what I can read a motion or an attempt to preclude <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3435.682s">any</a>  elected body from exercising their rights, what it's doing is establishing, requesting more or less an opinion as to whether or not a universal and standardized process can be crafted so that that can be utilized across all realms of government when it comes to the renaming of any type of facility of the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3456.276s">I</a>  don't really think we need to split hairs over this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3458.318s">It's</a>  not like we're trying to step on anybody's toes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3460.399s">All</a>  we're doing is asking the question, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3461.859s">can</a>  we establish a process? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3463.1s">And</a>  if we do establish that process, is it good for the school department as well as the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3467.903s">I</a>  don't see what's scary about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3469.104s">If</a>  in fact, it comes back with the answer that's a yes, then that's a whole different story. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3473.287s">But</a>  until we get there, I think that there's no harm in asking the question as presented.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3480.231s">If</a>  I may, but that's exactly, you kind of outlined exactly my point, which is that it's, can we do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3485.395s">And</a>  can we do this specifically for schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3489.095s">If</a>  we ask this question, I think we've gone through this before where we've asked a question and the language hasn't been quite right, and we've gotten kind of a wavery answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3497.398s">I'm</a>  just concerned that if we ask the question this way, the answer might be no, because the school committee has authority over schools instead of, you know, no, you can't do it for schools, but yes, you can do it for municipal buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3508.061s">So</a>  I guess I would just amend the paper to ask that the city solicitor specifically rule on whether we can craft a process for schools, municipal buildings, or for both.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3521.386s">I</a>  think that's what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3522.606s">And</a>  I'm not opposed to change the language around, but I think that's what it says.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3526.107s">And</a>  that's the, I'm not disputing the intent at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3528.828s">Just,</a>  I want to get the answer that we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3535.41s">Just</a>  that the city solicitors specifically issue a ruling on whether the council through ordinance can craft a process for naming schools, school buildings and facilities, municipal buildings and facilities, or <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3550.993s">both</a>  of those categories.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3553.655s">Why</a>  don't we just say something that's almost exactly what it says.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3557.377s">I'm</a>  just trying to ask two questions.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3559.758s">Next</a>  time I'll put you on the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3562.44s">Co</a>  sponsor and how about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3565.401s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3566.182s">It</a>  feels like I'm nitpicking. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3567.503s">I'm</a>  really just going back to the what you stated.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3570.204s">It's</a>  almost says verbatim what you just stated.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3573.006s">I</a>  hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3574.047s">It's</a>  going back to the question that we asked around the authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3578.849s">Now</a>  I'm blanking on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3583.896s">the</a>  disagreement between the solicitor and the administration on a legal question on the cast. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3588.98s">And</a>  we asked a question and the answer came back, well, maybe, and now there's this dispute. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3593.142s">I</a>  just wanna be really specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3594.483s">And</a>  that's the only reason I'm making this point.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3596.965s">Okay,</a>  I see the language is saying, but good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3600.868s">Good</a>  evening, name and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3605.751s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, can we put, oh, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3607.633s">Thank</a>  you, G News on 35 Parish Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3610.334s">Councilor</a>  Marks, thank you for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3613.531s">As</a>  someone who works in process regularly, I was really very disheartened by the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3620.255s">I</a>  know the folks that volunteered worked very hard, but I think we could benefit as a community by something with better shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3630.16s">I</a>  would hope that we could get an answer to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3632.061s">And</a>  I think we should even be looking at our parks and other facilities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3636.283s">As</a>  you say, we have a habit of making, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3641.307s">street</a>  corners named after folks and other areas throughout our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3644.968s">And</a>  I think as a community, if we have a clear understanding of what the expectation is, that helps. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3649.89s">And</a>  then you may even see opportunity for people to step forward because it's clear what they would be volunteering exactly to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3656.933s">So</a>  I think anytime you can put shape around a process, it's better. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3660.434s">We</a>  do it for other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3661.455s">We</a>  have multiple hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3663.115s">We</a>  have requirements for three hearings when we do amendments and when we're looking at implications to different <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3671.17s">projects</a>  to the city, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3672.731s">And</a>  so this seems to dovetail into everything else we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3675.934s">So</a>  I appreciate you bringing it forward and I appreciate your position on clarity, but I definitely think it's something that's well worth looking into because personally, I would really hate to see our community go through something like that again, if we can craft a process that just provides everybody the opportunity to be heard <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3697.282s">and</a>  iterative opportunity for feedback, and that didn't happen, I think, as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3702.443s">I</a>  think folks submitted on the issue at hand, saw what the results were, and then there was no opportunity for additional conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3712.085s">And</a>  I think that that was a good part of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3716.505s">So</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3717.726s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3718.166s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3721.206s">Mr.</a>  Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3724.667s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, can you please unmute Mr. Castagnetti? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3730.84s">Hold</a>  on, Andrew. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3739.327s">He's</a>  not on mute. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3741.108s">Okay,</a>  good evening, Andrew. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3742.89s">Name</a>  and address of the record.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3828.153s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3829.433s">So</a>  Ben is the MIT System Design and Management Industry and Certificate Director and the 2021 awardee of the Collier Medal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3837.558s">So</a>  MIT gives out a number of staff excellence awards each year, which are among the highest honors to staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3844.021s">As</a>  is the tradition, there's only one Collier Medal award winner. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3847.507s">And</a>  that's Ben, her Medford neighbor, Medford resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3850.968s">And</a>  the Collier Medal was established in 2014 to honor MIT police officer Sean Collier and his commitment to community engagement and model citizenship. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3859.469s">As</a>  I said, it's among the highest honors that MIT awards its staff and community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3864.11s">Ben</a>  was awarded this because in the spring of 2020, as the WHO declared COVID-19 to be an official pandemic and case numbers rose in Massachusetts, groups and individuals across MIT and the state sought ways to help <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3877.338s">Ben's</a>  background in the medical device industry and his training in applying a systems approach to socio-technical challenges immediately proved useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3885.083s">And</a>  he worked closely with professors in the Department of Mechanical Engineering to navigate the rapidly evolving response across the Institute and identify labs and other groups that could join these efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3895.669s">So</a>  through this work, Ben connected with the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, who convened experts from a variety of fields to form what became the Massachusetts Manufacturing Emergency Response Team. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3907.235s">And</a>  this collaborative, which was cross-disciplinary and cross-industry, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3912.3s">played</a>  a key role in the Baker-Polito administration's initial response to COVID-19, and the Massachusetts Manufacturing Emergency Response Team helped local manufacturers pivot their operations to produce PPE and other much-needed supplies for healthcare workers at scale. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3926.21s">And</a>  Ben helped lead the effort to provide medical device development guidance to manufacturers, and he also served as the team's key liaison with FDA officials and ensured that critical emergency regulatory requirements were addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3938.218s">So</a>  for these efforts, Ben was awarded the medal <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3940.89s">And</a>  I want to just take a moment to recognize him for this tremendous achievement. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=3944.992s">I</a>  know there are many, many Medford residents who contributed in many ways to the COVID-19 response, but I just want to call out this really high honor offered by MIT for his work across the state and just thank his neighbor, Laurel Ruma, for reaching out and ensuring that the community knows about one of its residents in this really important award.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4129.98s">If</a>  you give us a brief description of the project.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4134.655s">Yeah,</a>  so we applied to the CPA to fix a hole that is in our roof, which is right above our archives. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4143.479s">So</a>  this is an emergency because too much water damage could not only destroy, cause severe damage to the building, but also destroy our institutional records, as well as rebuilding our chimney, which is failing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4177.014s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4179.075s">Has</a>  there been any temporary work done? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4180.796s">So</a>  if it is leaking now, until this work gets done, that you won't have any damage or lose documents?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4187.658s">Yeah,</a>  so basically right now we have a barrel which is catching all of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4193.495s">the</a>  water, and as soon as this is approved, the contractors will begin work.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4199.719s">So</a>  nothing on the top of the roof, just temporarily a top or something that could stop?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4204.683s">No,</a>  when the roofers came out, there's a roof cap in the hole, so it didn't really make a lot of sense to start working on it before we could secure the funding, because to replace the roof cap is already really expensive.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4221.534s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4224.113s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4225.294s">Thank</a>  you for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4226.255s">Do</a>  you know how, so once the contractor gets the okay, do we know how long the project's going to take?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4231.778s">Yeah,</a>  so we are on the schedule in July to get the chimney repair, because that has to go first, and then the roof will be repaired by Old Mohawk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4243.026s">And</a>  that will happen as well, also in July, as soon as the chimney is done.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4247.79s">So</a>  we're thinking about it by August?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4249.971s">By</a>  August, hopefully we will have it fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4254.258s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4325.849s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4328.43s">Over</a>  the last 10 days, along with my city council colleagues, I have taken actions to get answers because the residents of Medford and the city of Medford employees deserve the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4339.373s">Now</a>  more than ever, we must think, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4342.393s">have</a>  increased awareness about the dynamics of power and vigorously pursue ways to create inclusive and competent work environments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4351.701s">Although</a>  personnel issues are not in the purview of the Medford City Council, we have the responsibility to the employees and to the citizens of Medford to maintain a community of equity and inclusion and to advocate for full transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4368.472s">In</a>  the instances described, Mayor Lungo-Koehn and a leadership team have failed Medford and I will not stand by and allow our talented city staff to be tarnished or degraded. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4378.397s">Every</a>  single city council have voted to take an independent and impartial investigation into this matter, requested appropriations from the mayor to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4389.243s">In</a>  a public document from Mayor Lungo-Koehn to the president of the city council dated June 28th, 2021, the mayor denied this request because <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4398.299s">It,</a>  and I quote, is nothing more than a political ploy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4405.966s">For</a>  the mayor of the state, the council's request to seek an independent investigation regarding this matter is a political ploy, is an absolute insult, not only to the members of this council, but to the two employees making these allegations. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4421.799s">The</a>  statement by the mayor downplays the seriousness <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4425.225s">of</a>  these allegations dismisses the integrity and reputation of the employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4430.527s">It</a>  calls into question mayor's integrity and motivation in investigating these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4437.81s">During</a>  the council's emergency meeting on June 23rd, city solicitor Kim Scanlon was asked to describe the process of how the third party investigator was selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4448.615s">City</a>  solicitor Scanlon stated, and I quote, made a recommendation and listed down <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4454.95s">to</a>  two candidates, and earlier today, the mayor agreed to the first candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4462.232s">This</a>  is in complete and total contrast to what the mayor stated in the June 28th letter to President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4468.754s">In</a>  that letter, the mayor stated the following, I did not participate in the selection of the third party then or now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4476.235s">A</a>  statement released to the Medford transcript by the city on June 24th, the mayor directed the city solicitor to engage the services of an independent third party selected by the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4488.603s">And</a>  you wonder why the council sought to hire an outside counsel and an investigator. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4493.306s">For</a>  the mayor to deny the council's request for funds is simply outrageous. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4500.11s">The</a>  resolution tonight is basically to get more information <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4503.718s">with</a>  regard to the private investigator that was hired by the administration on or before June 23rd, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4510.081s">The</a>  bullets points state exactly what I'm looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4516.844s">That's</a>  a copy of the signed contract for the investigatory services, a description of the procurement process used for this contract, a detail of funding source, line item and scope of services to be provided <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4530.762s">and</a>  a copy of the city ordinance the city solicitor is relying on as a basis for the procurement and hiring by the administration for this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4540.306s">I</a>  thank you for your time and I move approval.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4543.027s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4543.667s">Any</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4547.689s">On</a>  motion by Councilor Powell, seconded by Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4554.771s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4555.512s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4556.792s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4558.033s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4560.859s">2,</a>  1, 4, 3, 6 offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the 2021 municipal preliminary election be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4570.744s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4573.205s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4575.006s">So</a>  the purpose of this resolution is pretty literal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4578.728s">I</a>  was hoping we could have a discussion about the 2021 municipal preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4583.47s">As</a>  many residents know, from time to time during municipal election season, the city holds preliminary elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4590.378s">In</a>  recent years, I believe they have eliminated effectively one candidate out of a pool of 15 or 16 or two from 16 for city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4600.884s">It's</a>  a very costly exercise. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4603.766s">I</a>  believe it costs upwards of $50,000 of taxpayer money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4607.328s">And</a>  the outcome is really saying, well, you know, we're gonna have you pick from 14 candidates instead of 15 candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4615.617s">I</a>  think if that's the case, it may not be the best use of taxpayer dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4619.999s">I</a>  also think there's an argument that letting everybody run in the general election is a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4624.782s">We're</a>  not eliminating one or two candidates from the outset. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4629.244s">And</a>  I'm just interested into what my other fellow Councilors think about potentially filing a home rule petition to cancel the preliminary election and just allow all candidates to run in the November general election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4640.59s">One</a>  other reason I bring this up is significant <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4644.198s">legislative</a>  uncertainty around the option of mail-in voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4648.1s">It</a>  seems like the legislature may not pass a law by the time necessary to allow mail ballots for the preliminary election, but then may do it in time for the general election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4658.967s">So</a>  then we're talking about a different set of rules for each election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4662.229s">And</a>  I think it may just be better given the conditions that we're operating under to have the elections office focusing on making sure that the November election runs smoothly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4671.993s">Those</a>  are just some points for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4673.694s">I'm</a>  interested into what my other fellow Councilors think, and hopefully we can maybe take some action on it tonight.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4680.359s">If</a>  I can refer to the clerk for a little explanation to Councilor Bears, any guidance?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4689.686s">Councilor</a>  Bears is correct that this would require a home repetition to be canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4695.751s">And</a>  the estimate of $50,000 is the number that my predecessor <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4702.707s">often</a>  quoted to me for the cost of a preliminary municipal election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4706.948s">That's</a>  a back of the envelope calculation, but it's one that my predecessor used and was very confident in using.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4715.429s">Mr.</a>  President, nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4716.769s">I</a>  certainly can appreciate the measure in terms of when it comes to cost savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4723.671s">I</a>  don't think that that's necessarily a bad thing to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4727.371s">I</a>  do have concern over the process and when we make this determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4733.012s">if</a>  there's 15 candidates today, but there's 27 tomorrow, you know, where do we draw the line? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4739.473s">I</a>  guess the question that I have, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4741.073s">Do</a>  we wait till the papers close? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4742.074s">How</a>  much time do we need to get this legislation to get passed before we have to, can we do it after the paper deadline closes, but still have enough time to pass the normal petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4750.735s">You</a>  know, those are some of the questions that are from an operational standpoint that come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4755.256s">And</a>  I think that because of those questions in the past, we haven't really acted on a measure like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4762.213s">that</a>  couple with the fact that the city charter defines how we're supposed to move, leaves this up to be really a philosophical argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4770.998s">I</a>  certainly can support the idea of about $50,000 worth of cost savings, number one, and the uncertainty surrounding the ability to get the mail-in voting approved prior to the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4782.746s">So</a>  those are things that would certainly warrant some consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4787.509s">And</a>  if this Home Rule petition is something that does come up, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4790.261s">Those</a>  will be the items that I'm thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4793.024s">I</a>  certainly don't have a problem putting the question before this body, having us deliberate that to a full extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4799.052s">I</a>  think that's kind of like the intent of this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4803.497s">The</a>  council has put this paper forward to have a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4806.42s">I</a>  certainly don't have a problem having a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4808.142s">I</a>  don't even have a problem having the whole petition drafted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4810.762s">and</a>  having us have the opportunity to discuss and debate about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4814.264s">Um,</a>  you know, so with that being said, I can support the paper this evening if we're asking for a future beating for some defined parameters on how we're going to figure this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4823.409s">But,</a>  you know, at the same time, a child does call for preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4827.972s">Uh,</a>  you know, there's 15 candidates in the race. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4831.174s">Um,</a>  so it is what it is.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4834.276s">Thank</a>  you for the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4836.237s">Council</a>  morale.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4837.537s">I</a>  just want to echo vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4839.018s">I</a>  think councilor bears bringing this forward, but I think I have the same concerns as far as process and timing, just understanding if the pool does grow exponentially, which it can, you know, where are we then? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4847.984s">So</a>  just can we drop this paper after the deadline? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4851.706s">Can,</a>  will we get a response in time, which I don't know if we'll get those answers until it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4856.649s">But</a>  I do think this is something that warrants for the discussion.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4859.371s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4865.272s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleague for bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4869.756s">The</a>  questions I would have, Mr. President, surround, you know, we're talking about city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4875.219s">It's</a>  very possible that if there's a third candidate into the mayor's race, that that could trigger off a preliminary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4883.785s">And</a>  as we all know, Mr. President, depending on the number of people running for an office has an impact on the potential impact on the outcome of that office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4894.092s">I</a>  think there's a lot to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4896.693s">Also,</a>  I think anytime a body that could be perceived as doing something self-serving is something that you have to proceed with caution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4906.735s">And</a>  indeed, in my opinion, and I've stated this for years, the fact that the Bedford City Council is in order in the general election, an alphabetical order, and all the challenges are after us, it's a known fact that when it comes to the election process, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4923.346s">your</a>  positioning on the ballot has an impact on, you know, what you may get for votes, you know, the first and the last, and there's a whole science to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4934.949s">And</a>  believe me, I don't wanna be someone that may be perceived as putting forth something that may impact someone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4943.791s">You</a>  know, a new candidate running for public office wants to know, and a primary is, a preliminary is a good way of doing it, wants to know their strengths and weaknesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4953.474s">And</a>  that's an excellent way for a new candidate to say, you know what, I didn't do that well in the primary, I'm gonna focus on this area and this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4960.377s">What</a>  you're effectively doing is taking that away from someone. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4965.1s">And</a>  so there's a lot I think you have to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4967.901s">It's</a>  not just, you know, the savings is great, but I would ask that when you look at an election in the community and when 30%, what's the last percentage in the municipal election, Mr. Clark? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4981.852s">when</a>  30% of the registered voters come out, we should be promoting elections, whether they're preliminary or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4990.234s">I</a>  mean, we should be, and I've thought about this for years, putting out banners and A-frames and getting the message out, promoting elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=4998.877s">And</a>  I think when you start to cancel elections, I think what you see is a cheapening of the election process. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5007.413s">And,</a>  you know, so I think there's a lot, I'm not throwing this down, but I just think there's a lot to take into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5014.3s">And,</a>  you know, I'm not opposed to looking at this, but I really have some reservations on any time an elected a body that has a vested interest, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5024.93s">The</a>  finance is one thing, but you also have a vested interest in getting reelected, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5030.376s">And</a>  anytime you use your influence that may hinder someone else, whether you think it does or not, I mean, it's something that needs to be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5038.941s">In</a>  the past, Mr. President, and I think a couple of years ago, there was a letter sent out by one of the candidates asking all the other candidates, what are your thoughts on canceling the primary? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5049.806s">I</a>  think there were one or two extra candidates, and why spend the money, as Councilor Bears mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5054.829s">And</a>  we got a mixed bag back from candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5057.15s">Some</a>  wanted to keep it, some were opposed, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5060.092s">So</a>  I think these are the discussions I think we have to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5063.113s">So</a>  I'm not opposed to what Vice President Knight mentioned about taking a closer look, but I'm not sold on, you know, canceling any primary at this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5073.374s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5074.875s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5076.575s">I'd</a>  agree with Councilor Marks as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5078.475s">I</a>  have a quick question through you to the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5083.236s">What's</a>  the timing as far as when would you need to have an answer to send a homeowner petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5087.397s">I</a>  would imagine there's a process behind that.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5089.416s">Well,</a>  the ballot, if there is a preliminary election, and it very much looks like it will be at this point, the ballot order drawing would be Friday, August 13th, I believe at nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5104.702s">So</a>  there would have to be some sort of, likely some sort of answer before then, because I would be ordering the ballots the next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5113.625s">If</a>  the drawing is Friday, I wouldn't be able to get the ballots ordered on Friday, but I would definitely order them early the following week. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5120.28s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5121.501s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5122.641s">Scarpelli.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5123.121s">Through</a>  you to the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5126.223s">With</a>  that, again, remind everybody when the last day to accept nomination papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5131.625s">I</a>  think the last day to accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5135.127s">August</a>  10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5136.848s">10th?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5137.668s">No,</a>  there's a July. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5139.689s">There</a>  were July deadlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5140.69s">There's</a>  a July 23rd deadline for the last day to pull the papers and a July 23rd deadline for the last day to return the certificate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5145.972s">It</a>  was the last day to pull, so 26th. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5148.263s">23rd</a>  is the last day to pull, 27th is the last day to return the certified papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5151.946s">Okay,</a>  so again, I think that I appreciate that, and I appreciate Councilor Bears bringing that forward, because that's one thing I looked at when we first started running. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5160.073s">You</a>  look at primary, the savings is the number one thing, but I think that it's important that we still don't know what tomorrow brings, and I think it's a little too early, I think, because like Councilor Mark said, you had another candidate for the mayor's race, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5177.148s">and</a>  you don't run a primary, that can play a huge factor in what happens in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5183.01s">So</a>  I think that, unfortunately, I think timing is one of the biggest issues, and I feel the same as my fellow colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5191.093s">And</a>  I appreciate listening to you, talking about it, because it is a conversation that I think a lot of people in the community ask, because as Council Member Mark said the last time, it was really 50-50, not only with the candidates, but also with the constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5203.538s">I</a>  can't tell you how many times, if you don't have a primary, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5206.292s">we</a>  save a teacher and it sounds great in essence, but you know, with the process, I think that the due process that we have in place is there for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5213.914s">And</a>  I think that it's something that with the time being so congested and so questionable to move forward with eliminating is a little shaky for me.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5226.416s">So,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5227.836s">Thank</a>  you, Councilman Baez. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5231.117s">A</a>  few years ago when I was president, I think like three, four years ago, there was a 15 person race <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5236.532s">I</a>  was asked to do exactly what he did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5239.754s">All</a>  the candidates signed an affidavit saying they wanted to skip the primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5246.137s">And</a>  by the time of them signing it to be getting it to the clerk and the solicitor, half of them had changed their minds. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5257.784s">It</a>  does warrant some discussion in many cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5262.78s">done</a>  away with the primaries due to cost saving, where they changed the parameter of what constitutes a primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5269.247s">So,</a>  again, but you're still looking at some of what seems to happen, but it does warrant some further discussion going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5277.575s">And</a>  maybe everyone who turned papers in may not be picked up, may not turn their back. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5283.26s">So,</a>  we'll wait and see where that goes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5288.863s">And</a>  this is exactly what I was looking for by putting it on the way I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5291.604s">I</a>  just wanted to hear from everybody, hear some honest opinions about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5295.845s">I</a>  think the reason I put it on now is also in the timing question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5300.386s">We</a>  start to run out of time in terms of getting it out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5303.366s">And</a>  it seems to me like just given the way that our election calendar is currently structured, we're probably not going to be comfortable enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5310.088s">I</a>  mean, there's no way we're going to get a home rule out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5312.675s">you</a>  know, in early August, have it passed by the legislature and back to us by August 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5316.618s">So</a>  I would be comfortable meeting at some point in the future to discuss maybe the election calendar or how this could work in future elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5323.324s">And</a>  I'm sure potentially if there is ever a city charter review, it could come up during that process as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5328.468s">But</a>  I didn't wanna come in here guns blazing with my position on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5332.171s">I</a>  just wanted to see where the council stood on it because I think to Councilor Mark's point, maybe we could really <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5340.516s">boost</a>  the turnout for November with that extra money, put out the A-frames, do more of that outreach. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5345.059s">And</a>  I just want to try to think creatively in the future about how we can get more people engaged in municipal elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5350.424s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5530.951s">Good</a>  evening, honorable Councilors.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5533.813s">Give</a>  us a description.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5535.855s">Sure,</a>  so we're covering the snow and ice with free cash this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5540.599s">We</a>  didn't have any extra surplus because as you know, last year, we expected a cut in our services due to COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5549.927s">We</a>  are doing a transfer into the law budget for KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5554.828s">to</a>  cover KP law services and to cover some security reimbursements that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5561.791s">IT</a>  had a small stipend deficit that we're covering. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5566.194s">Appeals</a>  had a small stipend deficit that we're covering. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5569.976s">Fire</a>  overtime needed to be covered because usually if he has open positions, he's able to cover his overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5575.999s">But</a>  as you know, last year we had to cut a lot of the fire and police positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5580.641s">So</a>  we're covering that with free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5583.762s">Signal</a>  maintenance had a deficit to cover overtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5587.304s">Building</a>  inspectors needed to cover their weights and measures stipend for two instead of one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5591.667s">And</a>  they had an unbudgeted sick buyback. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5594.708s">And</a>  the Chevalier needed additional funding for two months of utilities.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5601.892s">Further</a>  questions?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5603.293s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5605.054s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5606.375s">Thank</a>  you, Director Nutley-Benjamin. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5608.476s">I</a>  just had one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5609.396s">What's</a>  our free cash balance going to be after these transfers? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5614.221s">7,000,381,098.92.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5614.241s">And</a>  just to follow up, are we going to be adding to that at all in the fiscal 22 budget?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5627.729s">Yes,</a>  we had a spending freeze implemented early on in the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5633.172s">So</a>  we should have some added reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5635.793s">In</a>  addition to that, at the end of the December, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5640.626s">Our</a>  number for growth was more than we'd expected, and that will also bolster our reserves.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5647.849s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5650.67s">Any</a>  further discussion on transfers? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5653.932s">With</a>  this transfer, Mr. President, are we in compliance with municipal finance law?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5766.913s">Yes,</a>  so one of the things that we're allowed to do with the American Rescue Plan Act, also shortened as ARPA, is cover revenue losses. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5774.696s">And</a>  the way that the United States Treasury looked at it is with COVID bringing so much losses, if you calculated based on the fiscal 19 as your base year, and then looked at your calendar year 2020 with 18 months with a 4.1% growth factor, I could take the difference between what we actually collected <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5794.777s">and</a>  with the 4.1%, and that's how I came up with the 12,000,345. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5800.079s">One</a>  thing the US Treasury says is to combine everything into one bucket, but mass general law and the way we do things is by different fund types. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5807.321s">And</a>  I did not feel comfortable, even though we're not given enough guidance on combining 12 million into just the general fund, because I can actually prove out the loss in the general fund and prove the losses on the school revolving funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5820.285s">So</a>  I split it out that way, and I have an Excel calculation and formula that <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5824.585s">shows</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5828.588s">So</a>  is it safe to say, Alicia, that we have a $12 million structural deficit?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5835.393s">Not</a>  a $12 million structural deficit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5837.454s">What</a>  that is saying is that the $4 million that we lost from the school, they're giving it back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5844.66s">The</a>  money that we lost in hotel revenue and local receipts, they're giving back to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5849.745s">and</a>  they're applying a 4.1% growth factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5852.307s">So</a>  instead of us having a loss for the calendar year, they're saying if nothing had happened and the world didn't go into COVID-19, you could have expected a 4.1% growth, this is what it would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5864.436s">So</a>  this is just keeping us steady, like everything's correct until we actually go back to normal.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5872.181s">Okay,</a>  and then what is the structural deficit presently if the budget were to pass this evening?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5878.73s">We</a>  don't have a structural deficit in the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5881.632s">I</a>  think the, as we spoke with the schools and with Dave Murphy, with the ESSER, then you have the ARPA, and then you have the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5890.759s">I</a>  think that with the school's increase is very large. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5895.102s">As</a>  you know, we are constricted by prop two and a half, but that, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5902.537s">3.736</a>  that we're giving them is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5904.961s">That's</a>  what their normal revolving is about 5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5908.946s">Their</a>  revolving went down to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5912.371s">And</a>  then with what we've given them, we gave them a 2% and a 2% of the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5916.917s">So</a>  that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5918.835s">And</a>  I think what they're gonna do with their ESSER money, they just have to be careful and cautious that with their cost structure and how things are, that these are one-time federal revenues and be careful not to build a structural deficit because the usual increase really shouldn't be more than two and a half percent.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5935.725s">Right,</a>  and last year we used about $5.5 million in reserves to balance the budget, right?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5940.868s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5942.309s">So</a>  how much money in reserves are we using this year to balance the budget?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5946.295s">We're</a>  not using any of our reserves this year, except for retained earnings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5951.017s">The</a>  500,000 that your honorable body approved for water and sewer to keep the taxpayers increase at 3% for the rate payers for their water and sewer, that's about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5963.703s">No</a>  other reserves are being used.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5965.863s">Except</a>  for this grant money, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5967.544s">This</a>  grant money dries up.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5968.505s">Yeah,</a>  and except for this grant money, which is restoring us back to pre-recession levels.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5975.667s">So</a>  this is non-recurring revenue after the next four years?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5981.148s">Yes,</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5982.868s">It</a>  ends December 31st, 2024, but they've extended it out to 26 if you decide to implement infrastructure projects because it does allow for water, sewer, and broadband projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=5997.851s">So</a>  they've extended it.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6003.652s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6004.695s">if</a>  by 2024 we don't realize this $12.34 million annually, we're going to be in a situation after this.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6015.321s">We</a>  haven't recovered, but I know the state said they expect us to recover by fiscal year 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6019.603s">That's</a>  what Massachusetts state expects. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6021.564s">So</a>  I didn't buy that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6023.245s">12</a>  31 24 would be fiscal year 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6023.965s">But</a>  if we don't</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6027.5s">recover,</a>  then we're looking at a situation where we might have.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6031.003s">Yeah,</a>  if we didn't recover, then yes, we'd be looking at a situation where we'd be looking at what we need to do, just like we did when COVID first hit.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6038.67s">So</a>  what's the plan in terms of between now and then to bolster our reserve in case we don't recover?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6044.735s">So</a>  as we did this year, we implemented a freeze in January to bolster our reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6051.014s">So</a>  we're not intending on spending any more of our reserves unless it's for capital needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6057.637s">We</a>  are very good at looking at our spending and not overspending. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6061.979s">Usually</a>  we're able to absorb the snow and ice deficit into the general fund operations because there's a surplus. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6068.942s">That's</a>  how well managed it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6071.263s">But</a>  because of COVID, we had to use our free cash reserves.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6075.765s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6078.306s">Any</a>  further discussion on the transfers? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6081.582s">Okay,</a>  on the motion, this was on the motion.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6088.264s">I</a>  have one more question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6089.845s">This</a>  looks like it's a two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6091.945s">It</a>  says one, will you create the AFA grant account two, will you appropriate the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6095.246s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6096.907s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6098.847s">Will</a>  we need to take two votes?</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6105.329s">If</a>  your body thinks you need to take two votes, I'm fine with that.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6109.516s">I</a>  think one's a spending paper.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6111.016s">So</a>  that the account was created and then we could transfer the funds directly out of the account into their correct places. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6116.837s">But</a>  if it should be two, I'm absolutely fine with that.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6118.998s">I</a>  think one requires five and one requires four.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6122.278s">So</a>  the question should be split. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6126.039s">Yes,</a>  we can do it in two different questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6129.98s">First</a>  question, Mr. President, to create the fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6132.64s">So</a>  on the motion by Vice President Knight, <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6138.122s">Move</a>  approval on the first question, seconded by second, second, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6141.523s">Council</a>  of bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/4FrRjkCyMqA&t=6142.903s">Uh,</a>  Mr. Clerk, please call the roll council bears.</p>
