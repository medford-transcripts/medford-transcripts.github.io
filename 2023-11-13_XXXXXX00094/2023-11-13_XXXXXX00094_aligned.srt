1
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,528
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:46,325
I think you both are being here with me today.

10
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:49,708
If you don't mind just starting out with introduction.

11
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:53,291
So you could say your name, your pronouns and a bit about who you are.

12
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:56,935
Okay, I'll go first.

13
00:00:57,796 --> 00:01:03,341
Sharon Hayes, she, her, I am a school committee member until the end of December.

14
00:01:05,345 --> 00:01:07,087
And I am Melanie McLaughlin.

15
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:09,269
My pronouns are she, her.

16
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:15,976
I am a school committee member running for reelection and I am the mom of three.

17
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:18,456
Thank you both.

18
00:01:18,896 --> 00:01:23,761
And I just want to say, so we're recording this the Friday before the election.

19
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:27,725
So best of luck to you, Melanie and Sharon, thank you so much for your service.

20
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:31,589
We're definitely going to miss you, but I'm sure you won't be far away from the action.

21
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,832
But first, if we could start with that food question.

22
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:40,418
So if you guys could let me know or let us know what your favorite place to eat is in Medford and what you like to eat there.

23
00:01:43,389 --> 00:01:47,653
Well, lately I've been eating a few times at Bocelli's.

24
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:59,425
I have a dear friend from Medford who passed away recently and she always went to Bocelli's and had her daughter's birthday parties at Bocelli's all the time and stuff.

25
00:01:59,465 --> 00:02:04,830
So going there has reminded me of her and also of how delicious the food is.

26
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,613
It's just, you know, it really is good stuff.

27
00:02:08,564 --> 00:02:10,105
So I enjoy going there.

28
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:16,490
And every Friday, our family on a standard basis gets takeout from Amici.

29
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,312
So we feel like we really love Mario and the team there.

30
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,714
So those are our two tops.

31
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:32,702
For me, I guess I have to go with probably the same two that I said when I first interviewed when I was running two years ago.

32
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,152
Because through my boys, we've gotten to know the owners of both of these places.

33
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:44,218
So Colleen's Ice Cream, we go there a lot for grilled cheese sandwiches and milkshakes.

34
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:52,305
And Wellington Pizza, because my younger son has become very friendly with Adriano, the owner.

35
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:54,087
So those are our two favorites.

36
00:02:54,927 --> 00:02:58,150
Yeah, Shannon, I feel like I've seen you at Colleen's a whole bunch of summer evenings.

37
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,831
We're there a lot.

38
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:02,486
It's a great Friday tradition sometimes.

39
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:03,387
Yes.

40
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:04,027
Awesome.

41
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:14,513
So I invited you both on here today to talk about something specific, which is a policy that you've made a motion to put before the school committee.

42
00:03:14,913 --> 00:03:19,295
I think, as we were talking a little bit before, it sounds like you had your first reading of this.

43
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,897
And so it's sort of in process of

44
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:33,903
You can correct me if I'm wrong here, but the sort of in process of being approved, but you know it's a it's called the non discrimination on the basis of gender identity policy.

45
00:03:33,924 --> 00:03:39,807
So I was wondering if you could share a little bit about what that policy is and why it's important.

46
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:50,710
Well first I want to say that really member Hayes, Sharon Hayes really has put this policy forward more than anyone.

47
00:03:51,331 --> 00:04:05,705
Mia Mustone and myself signed on to the motion but Sharon has really done all of the legwork in this and we're really appreciative of that and I will echo your sentiment about how much she is going to be missed on the school committee.

48
00:04:06,508 --> 00:04:09,289
But I agree, I don't think she'll be too far from the action.

49
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,210
I certainly hope not.

50
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,752
So I want to just put it out there that Sharon really put this forward and did a lot of the legwork behind it.

51
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:21,975
And the reason that I support it is because I think that inclusion is really important in our schools, and everybody should feel welcome.

52
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:25,757
Thanks, Melanie.

53
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:33,260
Well, I can talk a little bit to the history of how I came to putting forward the policy.

54
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:43,095
Um, when I originally ran for school committee on my platform, I talked about wanting to look at policies and supports for our LGBTQ plus students.

55
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:47,857
Um, and then I had the honor in, uh, let's see, fall of 22.

56
00:04:48,617 --> 00:05:00,600
So after I was elected, after I started in January of 22, um, I knew, uh, a student who was on the high school GSA, um, gender and sexuality Alliance.

57
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:02,721
And, um, she,

58
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:16,877
I was talking with her about what kinds of supports they felt they did have and what kinds of things maybe in the GSA they were talking about needing more of.

59
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:23,881
And through that, the GSA actually invited me to go to one of their meetings, which I did.

60
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:26,243
And it was wonderful.

61
00:05:27,003 --> 00:05:28,384
High school students are amazing.

62
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:45,680
I, both of my boys are younger, so I don't yet have a high school student and I was just, you know, in awe of how eloquent they were and how outspoken yet understanding of things that take time to happen.

63
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:54,443
But the main concern they ended up talking about was needing better access to gender neutral bathrooms.

64
00:05:56,703 --> 00:06:23,062
And so in the process of working with them on that, working with the administration on trying to identify more bathrooms that could be labeled or, you know, transformed, changed into gender neutral bathrooms or greater access for them, I realized, you know, we don't have a policy in place that the students can kind of look to and say, you know, you have this policy that says we need access.

65
00:06:23,575 --> 00:06:26,696
Right now, we're not feeling we have the access we really need.

66
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:36,080
At that time, there was one bathroom in specific that had been converted about 10 years ago into a gender-neutral bathroom.

67
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:44,284
But it's in a part of the high school that not everyone accesses because it was in the vocational side.

68
00:06:46,444 --> 00:06:58,293
And so again, realizing that they don't, that the students don't necessarily and families don't necessarily have a policy or anything they can look to say, here are the things that you said you would do to support us.

69
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:01,736
There's one area that we're not seeing that support.

70
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:05,599
And can you, let's look at the policy and talk about how you can make sure that's being met.

71
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,183
So through that, then we talked about, I think put forward a motion

72
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:20,731
to have the diversity, equity and inclusion subcommittee meet to start talking about the needs of the LGBTQ plus students.

73
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:27,073
And it's been difficult to get meetings scheduled sometimes, just there's a lot of things on the docket.

74
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:38,696
And so at that point, I started looking around at other school systems and seeing that there are some that have this policy, this non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity.

75
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:43,714
And so that's when I started working on actually making a policy that we could put forward.

76
00:07:45,155 --> 00:07:57,040
With the understanding that we're still going to have those meetings, they may end up being after I'm gone, the DEI subcommittee, and continuing to talk about what other supports can be put in place.

77
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:08,565
Every policy is a living document in terms of it can constantly be changed, tweaked, added to, made better, so hopefully,

78
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:22,042
you know, once we get this in place, if we get this in place, which I think we're on our way to doing, then the DEI subcommittee can really work on refining it more or looking at other things that are needed to support our students.

79
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:28,785
And so, did the DEI subcommittee exist before you started this, working on this policy?

80
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:31,266
It did, yeah.

81
00:08:31,566 --> 00:08:36,750
And I don't know, I guess Member McLaughlin could speak more to that because she's been on so much longer than me.

82
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:45,218
I don't know if that was new this term or whether it existed before the current term.

83
00:08:45,978 --> 00:08:50,582
Yeah, I'm the chair of the DEI Subcommittee, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Subcommittee.

84
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:54,326
It did not exist, if I'm not mistaken, before this term.

85
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:55,947
I think it was created this term.

86
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:05,918
because I don't recall it having a lot of action in the previous term, so I believe it was added this term, but again, I would have to fact check that for sure.

87
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:14,006
I am the chair and member Hayes, and is it member McStone?

88
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:15,027
No, who's the third?

89
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,429
Member Russo.

90
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:18,370
I'm sorry, member Russo, of course.

91
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:20,773
And I think that

92
00:09:22,315 --> 00:09:31,374
Constituents don't understand the way that the subcommittees work and I think that it's a really important component of the school committee and people should understand how they work and so.

93
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:37,281
There are subcommittees created based on a number of issues.

94
00:09:37,581 --> 00:09:47,724
And the mayor, the chair of the school committee assigns who goes to what committees, just like in a state house or in the federal government, right?

95
00:09:48,584 --> 00:09:49,784
You're assigned to different committees.

96
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:57,626
And there's a chair of those committees and two other members, and they meet independently of the school committee.

97
00:09:58,006 --> 00:10:00,647
But they can dig deeper into particular issues.

98
00:10:00,827 --> 00:10:01,867
And I think that people,

99
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:05,670
in the community who are interested in specific issues.

100
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,274
For example, I am the chair of the behavioral health and special education subcommittee as well.

101
00:10:11,055 --> 00:10:22,085
And so people that are interested in specific issues can reach out to the chairs of those subcommittees and ask for a subcommittee meeting based on a particular topic that they want to drill down into.

102
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:30,448
In fact, I did that before I was on the school committee I, you know, we asked for a special education subcommittee to be created.

103
00:10:30,948 --> 00:10:39,691
It was, and then we asked for meetings so that we could move forward some particular issues around special education before again, I had been elected.

104
00:10:41,672 --> 00:10:57,590
Previously, you know, some of the subcommittees are dormant, you know, so it's really making sure that we have active involved subcommittees and chairs, but it's a great way for people in the community to be able to get sort of more individualized attention to a specific topic.

105
00:10:59,003 --> 00:11:13,333
That's really helpful to know and I don't think that I knew that's how subcommittees were created and and it's, and I'm hearing sharing you talking about how this is some, you did your research, you met with the GSA, you figured out what was important to them.

106
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:16,696
Can't really think of a better way to create policy there.

107
00:11:18,397 --> 00:11:22,340
but that any community member could approach a subcommittee like this.

108
00:11:22,841 --> 00:11:26,884
And it also, I think, speaks to how we see school committee meetings.

109
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:35,511
And I don't know that everybody appreciates that this is one meeting every two weeks or whatever, but that a lot of your work is outside of that meeting.

110
00:11:36,192 --> 00:11:43,358
And I think that's just something that gets lost in the focus on those meetings and the amount of time that you all are putting into

111
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:49,428
your work and that you have to figure out the schedules of all the subcommittee members to make those things work.

112
00:11:49,468 --> 00:11:51,450
So I appreciate all of that work.

113
00:11:52,931 --> 00:12:05,822
And I just like to highlight it because I think sometimes we forget about how much we expect of elected officials and how it's not your full-time job that you do a lot of other stuff.

114
00:12:05,842 --> 00:12:06,683
So thank you for that.

115
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:10,606
I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more specifically about what's in the motion.

116
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:12,933
Sure.

117
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:19,776
So the proposal for this policy, again, it's called non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity.

118
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:36,602
There's some sections under it going into some specific areas of support we want to give or, again, kind of giving students those areas that then go back and talk to administration and say, you know, here's what's in the policy if the policy gets passed.

119
00:12:37,042 --> 00:12:41,144
So there's a section about names and pronouns, about the right to

120
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:48,308
students have to request that they be called by a different name or use different pronouns.

121
00:12:48,528 --> 00:13:04,881
And that under Massachusetts law, we recognize common law name changes so that an individual doesn't have to have a legal document changing their name in order to ask that the school use a different name or pronoun.

122
00:13:06,164 --> 00:13:06,785
There's more to it.

123
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:11,628
Again, I can go back and add more detail at any point to any of these if you want to talk more about them.

124
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:33,145
There's another section about transitions and when a student is transitioning, how the school can create supports around for that student, whether it's through a team of staff working with that student, kind of talking about how do you want this to look at school?

125
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:40,116
How do you want us to talk with people about this transition for you?

126
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:51,303
And also talking about, you know, some issues with how to call, what name and pronouns to use with this student during meetings.

127
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:53,738
with their parents.

128
00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:00,441
Then there's another section about restrooms, lockers, and changing facilities.

129
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:21,171
And again, that was the main issue that came up when I met with the GSA, was that idea of having access to either the bathrooms that match their gender identity, which is part of the law now, or if they're not comfortable with that, making sure there are gender neutral bathrooms that are available to them and to any other student who needs them.

130
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:23,570
single stall bathrooms.

131
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:34,479
And I know that one of the changes to high school, I don't know if it was even a change, to be honest, I think they were doing a lot of these things already, but just making it more explicit was a help.

132
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:43,646
You know, having some of the single stall bathrooms that already exist, putting signage up to say that this is a gender neutral bathroom that anyone can use.

133
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,409
So that's another heading.

134
00:14:47,489 --> 00:14:48,010
Then there's

135
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:59,212
Privacy, confidentiality, and student records, talking about the laws and policies around changing student records.

136
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:10,620
Again, if there's a transition or whether it's a social transition or a medical transition, if there's a name change, gender markers need to be changed, talking about how to go about that.

137
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,644
Then there's a specific one about gender markers on student records because there are some very specific

138
00:15:17,382 --> 00:15:19,242
laws about how to go about doing that.

139
00:15:21,223 --> 00:15:31,005
The original proposal also had a section for physical education classes and intramural and interscholastic athletic activities.

140
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:33,565
And then another one for dress code.

141
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:39,507
There was some discussion at the meeting that we just had on November 1st.

142
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:42,147
That was the first reading of this proposed policy.

143
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:45,188
And there was some discussion around

144
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:52,634
that there were other policies that already included these areas and maybe we didn't need to duplicate those.

145
00:15:52,834 --> 00:16:04,517
So at this moment, those two sections have been taken out of this policy because they exist or will exist when will exist in the wellness policy that's being worked on right now.

146
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:13,220
And the dress code really is that we already have really is pretty expansive and non-restrictive.

147
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,588
So those are the sections of the policy.

148
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:20,089
And we can talk proposed policy.

149
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:21,190
We can talk more about them.

150
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,851
There's certain ones you want to talk about.

151
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:24,371
All right.

152
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:25,012
Thank you.

153
00:16:25,032 --> 00:16:26,192
You explained a lot there.

154
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:38,958
And I'm wondering kind of if there is like what you sort of attention you received when talking about this in the school committee or kind of how folks can support this motion if they want to.

155
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:45,622
Well, I think yeah I'm happy to respond to that.

156
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:46,446
I think that.

157
00:16:48,223 --> 00:17:06,687
you know, the same ways that we often get information from constituents where they're, you know, via phone calls and emails, the same way that you advocate with your state delegation, your legislators, your federal delegation, you can always write and email us and, you know, let us know thoughts.

158
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:11,288
Certainly, you know, coming to school committee meetings is always great for folks who can't come.

159
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:13,969
We're glad that we have hybrid options, right?

160
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:14,889
So people can do that.

161
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,130
Subcommittee meetings are also

162
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:31,445
public and as our committee of the whole of course, this was in a committee of the whole, which is sort of like a subcommittee but it's the entire school committee so it's separate from like a school committee meeting with a full agenda.

163
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:35,410
It's a committee of the whole usually on one topic so we had a committee of the whole.

164
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:41,156
One committee the whole meeting on this specifically and so people can also attend those.

165
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:53,490
I think for the students, it's really important for them to know about this and you know I really appreciate member Hayes going, you know, to the GSA and that's a really important part of.

166
00:17:55,112 --> 00:18:05,958
our responsibility as elected officials, and I think we need to do more of that, frankly, and that's something that I hope to do more of in this next term should I get reelected.

167
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:21,387
I want to go into the community and find people in the community and specifically around folks who are not able to come to school committee meetings or are not able to access the meetings via Zoom or are not able to access the meetings because of language differences or other differences.

168
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:22,127
I really am

169
00:18:23,508 --> 00:18:27,850
to find those people and see how we can engage them as well.

170
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,891
And the students are a big part of that.

171
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:36,333
And I think that we've made some progress on getting student involvement.

172
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:40,975
And Member Hayes has certainly been a part of that, as have I and some other members on the school committee.

173
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:42,916
But I think we can do more.

174
00:18:43,216 --> 00:18:49,019
And I think that when an issue is important to the students, they generally show up.

175
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,700
And I expect that

176
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,021
there would be students that would be supporting this and I would hope that they would show up if needed.

177
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:00,182
Yeah, there's a lot of layers there.

178
00:19:00,362 --> 00:19:12,125
You know, I think we hear a lot of adults and parents giving feedback to the school committee, but figuring out what is it the students that are maybe the most impacted by school policy are feeling.

179
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:14,686
I also think it's the access issue, right?

180
00:19:14,706 --> 00:19:16,887
So it's also like who is

181
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:19,327
able, right?

182
00:19:19,347 --> 00:19:20,928
When we're talking about ableism, right?

183
00:19:20,988 --> 00:19:24,010
Who is able to come to the table and who is not, right?

184
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:29,013
Like there are people who are not for any number of reasons and it's, you know, maybe they're not out, right?

185
00:19:29,073 --> 00:19:33,155
Maybe they're not willing to talk about that, you know, all sorts of things.

186
00:19:33,195 --> 00:19:34,396
Maybe they can't advocate.

187
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:36,297
Maybe the language is the barrier.

188
00:19:37,298 --> 00:19:39,439
Maybe they're neurodivergent.

189
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:40,980
I mean, there's a million different things.

190
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:46,803
And so thinking about how we represent those populations as well is super important because

191
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:57,215
We have roughly 4,000 students and families in our schools, and everybody needs to be represented, and that's really the important piece.

192
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:03,099
Yeah, I think I talk about this a lot, but we had David Harris on the podcast like two years ago now.

193
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:16,082
And he talked about this idea of like, we use that phrase, like who's invited to the table or who's at the table and that idea of kind of like rethinking that are like, should we throw out that whole idea of the table?

194
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:22,664
And like, how are we getting to those people that aren't able to or feel excluded from the process already?

195
00:20:23,124 --> 00:20:23,804
And I really liked that.

196
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:25,804
I think it really changed how I thought about things.

197
00:20:26,785 --> 00:20:27,345
But also like,

198
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:29,986
just a shout out to the high school GSA.

199
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:33,869
I've met with some of them and also their faculty advisors.

200
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:37,031
And they do a lot within the school.

201
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:41,474
They told me about their, in the beginning of the year, they do a presentation for all the students.

202
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:44,335
And so I think that it's really powerful.

203
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:53,581
And I think that element that Sharon, you talked about, kind of how staff will be trained and how this will be sort of implemented at that level as well.

204
00:20:55,682 --> 00:20:56,763
It sounds really exciting to me.

205
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:58,523
I think those ideas sound really exciting.

206
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:01,604
I hope you get a lot of support.

207
00:21:01,624 --> 00:21:03,745
I do too.

208
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:13,228
I think just getting back to David Harris and some of the stuff that he's talked about, David's an amazing member of our community and brings so much to the table.

209
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:22,431
Great example of somebody that not only brings stuff to the table, but is creating environments so that it's not just about a table that you have to bring stuff to.

210
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,052
I love there's a quote from

211
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:39,205
I think it was Shirley Chisholm I can't remember that you know said bring your own chair right like bring your own folding chair whatever to the table or what have you I can't remember the exact quote of it but you know David's right in terms of, you know, thinking outside of the box about how we're really engaging

212
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:44,889
the community and we talk about it in these phrases like family and community engagement, right?

213
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:51,134
And they sort of become meaningless because they're just phrases that people hear over and over again, right?

214
00:21:51,174 --> 00:22:01,123
Family engagement or inclusion or, you know, all of these sort of things that people think they know what they mean, but they're really just become buzzwords that have no meaning because they've been used so much.

215
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:03,804
And so there's sort of empty meaning.

216
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:17,729
And what does that actually look like and so we're talking about an equity is another one right like we talked about equity equity equity right it's like what is equity, have we defined what equity is, and how are we really practicing that right and so you know a few years ago we had.

217
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:25,012
folks that David Harris is familiar with, and we applied for a grant.

218
00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:28,033
We did an application through DESE.

219
00:22:28,053 --> 00:22:33,815
It wasn't a grant, but it was an application to have a family engagement review of the district.

220
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:42,538
We had a third-party school in Maine come in through DESE to do a review of our district, and they do it with other districts, and we got the application.

221
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:48,460
Only a few throughout the state that were approved for the application to have our family and community engagement reviewed.

222
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:58,568
So school in Maine came in as independent, you know contractors that for free through this, you know, application process to review our family and community engagement and.

223
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:25,635
What they ended up saying was that, and this was only two or three years ago, this was three years ago actually, that Medford really wasn't ready for meaningful family engagement, that we hadn't really made that commitment to meaningful family and community engagement, and that they were willing to stay on another year pro bono to work with us to really help identify how to make that happen and really transcend that engagement to make that happen.

224
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:45,032
And unfortunately, the school committee voted, you know, the, the, it was put out there that there was not because we were still dealing with the pandemic and we were so over committed with all the other things that we were doing, you know, it was voted that at that time we couldn't, we couldn't do that we couldn't commit resources to, you know, really looking at family and community engagement.

225
00:23:45,692 --> 00:23:56,848
And honestly, the irony was not lost on me, right, that this outside organization who does this work, you know, nationally, you know, was telling us that we didn't have a commitment to family engagement and here we voted.

226
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:01,545
that we didn't have a priority for family engagement because we had to prioritize so many other things.

227
00:24:02,305 --> 00:24:25,580
I honestly think, and I say this in my lit and I really believe it, until we transform that relationship with the community and build the trust that we need to with families and students and the community as a whole so that it's a mutual relationship and it's a back and forth with two-way communication and real trust and expertise in our community and our families and our schools, it's going to be really difficult to transform the system.

228
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:30,751
I didn't know about that, but it's helpful information.

229
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:31,792
Yeah.

230
00:24:32,553 --> 00:24:41,540
And so just to get back to this motion, sounds like people can write to you all, just express their support, ask questions.

231
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:46,264
And then it sounds like the next reading will be on November 20th.

232
00:24:46,364 --> 00:24:47,966
Is that right?

233
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:49,307
Yes, that's correct.

234
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:51,369
There's a regular school committee meeting that night.

235
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:52,970
The second meeting will be that night.

236
00:24:53,788 --> 00:24:54,088
All right.

237
00:24:55,089 --> 00:25:00,434
Well, yeah, is there anything that we haven't talked about regarding this or anything else that either of you want to like plug or bring up?

238
00:25:03,076 --> 00:25:14,326
Well, the other thing I'd like to plug, because it does go along with this and goes along with what Melanie was just talking about in terms of engagement of the community, looking at student engagement, I think we have the same issue with student engagement.

239
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,507
You know, I think that

240
00:25:16,839 --> 00:25:23,684
we really need to hear more from our students directly about what they need, what they see is going well, what they see is not going so well.

241
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:32,051
So we're working right now also on getting going on a law that was in place a few years ago, I think.

242
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:38,196
I don't know actually when it originally came in, but we have a policy that goes with it too for a student advisory committee.

243
00:25:38,216 --> 00:25:41,018
And to be fair, this has been,

244
00:25:42,153 --> 00:25:46,955
This has been out for a while, and a lot of school systems have not figured out how to make this work yet either.

245
00:25:47,055 --> 00:25:53,097
So this isn't just a Medford issue that we haven't really started this yet, but we're working on it.

246
00:25:54,038 --> 00:26:11,925
And what that law says and what our policy says is that five students will be elected from the high school, elected by the students, and they will form what is called the Student Advisory Committee, and they will meet every other month with the school committee.

247
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:24,290
so that they can have a direct voice in decision making and letting us know directly what their needs are and what, again, what they see is going well, what they see is more areas of need.

248
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:30,178
And we're working our way into this because it's not, you know, it's very specific law, but making it

249
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:33,330
meeting the letter of the law is going to take a while.

250
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:47,494
Meeting the spirit of the law in terms of trying to make sure we have a group of students and that we are finding a way to have them meet, maybe not with the entire committee yet, but at least with some subgroup of the committee as we work our way into this policy.

251
00:26:47,534 --> 00:26:49,175
So we're working on that right now.

252
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:53,056
Hopefully the first meeting will be soon.

253
00:26:54,896 --> 00:26:59,498
And I guess the other thing I'd like to just plug, just because it goes along with this too, is I know that the

254
00:27:00,678 --> 00:27:15,644
City Council has a couple of proposed commissions that they're working on through subcommittee, because I just went to the meeting maybe last week, and I think this has been spearheaded by Councilor Tseng.

255
00:27:17,105 --> 00:27:26,849
They have both a youth commission, again, to try to get the youth voice into what's going on in the city, what their needs are,

256
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:32,746
in areas of improvement and where they need to have more say.

257
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:37,908
Also, I'm trying to think what the exact name of this commission is.

258
00:27:38,528 --> 00:27:43,649
It has to do with also gender equity.

259
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:54,492
I'm sorry that I can't remember the exact name of the commission, but they're going through their process and subcommittee of trying to create these commissions too.

260
00:27:55,688 --> 00:27:59,670
honestly didn't even know that until I saw it on an agenda and went to the meeting.

261
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:09,193
So it's kind of nice that we're having these parallels between the school level, trying to create some of these policies and groups at the school level.

262
00:28:09,693 --> 00:28:11,654
And they're also doing that at the city level.

263
00:28:11,794 --> 00:28:21,658
So across the board, I'd say in city government or elected government, we're trying to really work on this issue of getting the voices of our community in.

264
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,072
It seems like doing that in a proactive way too.

265
00:28:25,092 --> 00:28:48,572
I know we heard from the mayor a few times about how when we had that, you know, the instance of violence in the high school last year that students came to city hall to sort of express their concerns and their thoughts about it and sort of in being proactive about like learning about that as it's, you know, maybe before it's happening or as things are building up for students and other constituents through those other commissions.

266
00:28:49,152 --> 00:28:51,014
It sounds really helpful.

267
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:52,973
Yes, yes.

268
00:28:53,774 --> 00:29:00,721
And I guess I would like to add a couple of things to, you know, one is that who knows better what's going on in our schools than our teachers and our students, right?

269
00:29:01,161 --> 00:29:10,551
And we need to be able, and our staff, and we need to be able to hear from them because, you know, we might hear from our own children that are in our schools bits and pieces, but certainly not everything.

270
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:14,355
And so those, you know, people that are living it, that are boots on the ground, what have you,

271
00:29:14,735 --> 00:29:22,680
really sort of getting them to interact with the policymakers is super important so that we can understand what is going on, so that we can improve things.

272
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:34,988
And I think that, you know, folks think that or assume that the school committee knows everything that's going on and we're all eyes and all seeing we don't like that's the whole point, we need to be able to be informed and that sort of

273
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:36,809
one of the ways that we're informed.

274
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:45,297
Additionally, we've heard in the past like, oh, we never see people in the building or school committee members don't come to the classrooms or tour the building or whatever.

275
00:29:45,537 --> 00:29:46,578
We have to be invited.

276
00:29:46,638 --> 00:29:54,766
We can't walk around randomly and pop in people's classes and observe and just check out what's going on.

277
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:55,647
We have to be invited.

278
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:58,769
We are often invited and we encourage that.

279
00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:01,472
Invite your school committee members to come see what's going on.

280
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:07,480
you know, we meet for folks with cough for coffee, they're often open office hours to come and talk.

281
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,761
I mean, I think it's really important.

282
00:30:09,422 --> 00:30:15,866
The other thing I wanted to mention is that, you know, non-discrimination as a whole is super important, right, in our district.

283
00:30:15,906 --> 00:30:22,811
And so we also passed a non-discrimination clause that is supposed to go out to every

284
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:29,759
individual on every document that goes outside of our school or anything that engages in our school.

285
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:47,893
From athletics to afterschool, to enrichment, to PTO, to anything, there is supposed to be included a non-discrimination statement that says Medford does not discriminate based on these things, gender, ability, race, all of this above.

286
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:53,557
If you need accommodations to be able to access any of these things,

287
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:59,833
here's the process, here's the contact, here's whatever, because we didn't have a statement on accommodations either.

288
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:10,062
And people didn't know that, first of all, that they're entitled to accommodations to access anything that is the life of the school as a public school student or staff member, or how to get them.

289
00:31:10,122 --> 00:31:12,945
And so that nondiscrimination statement was super important.

290
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:15,867
part of the issue is, is that actually happening?

291
00:31:15,927 --> 00:31:19,731
And we don't know if that's actually happening if people don't tell us, right?

292
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:28,619
So people should be seeing on all documentation that comes out of the school where you have to sign up for something, a non-discrimination statement that tells you how to get accommodations if you need them.

293
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:30,600
Wonderful.

294
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,640
Yeah, I did not know that.

295
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:42,523
And that's really helpful to know both that there's an effort to be explicit about non-discrimination and that there's a way to work, you know, to get accommodations or to ask for accommodations if you need them.

296
00:31:43,023 --> 00:31:43,643
It's great news.

297
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:47,104
Well, news to me, other people may have known it.

298
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:48,084
Well, thank you both.

299
00:31:48,284 --> 00:31:50,825
Just how much we're going to miss Sharon Hayes.

300
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:59,767
And we expect fully that you're, again, we know that you're, you know, a very involved community member and activist, and we are so appreciative of your service.

301
00:32:00,387 --> 00:32:00,888
Thank you.

Amen to that.

306
00:32:07,955 --> 00:32:09,476
All right.

307
