1
00:00:37,446 --> 00:00:37,926
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:43,111
Hi.

3
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:47,215
We can just give everyone another minute or so.

4
00:00:57,664 --> 00:01:04,069
Actually, while we are waiting for people to join, maybe I will start doing some of the initial reading of our

5
00:01:07,743 --> 00:01:09,964
meeting notice and then we can get that out of the way.

6
00:01:10,104 --> 00:01:18,006
So please be advised that on Wednesday, April 27th from four to 5 p.m.

7
00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:22,628
there'll be a communications and family engagement subcommittee meeting held for remote participation via Zoom.

8
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:28,450
The meeting can be viewed through Medford Community Media on Comcast channel 15 and Verizon channel 45 from four to 5 p.m.

11
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:41,676
And the meeting ID is 975-668-61252.

12
00:01:53,527 --> 00:02:01,736
Our agenda topics for today are absenteeism and truancy notifications and communications strategy update.

13
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:06,701
I'm just going to take the roll real quick.

14
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:08,643
Member McLaughlin?

15
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:09,764
Here.

16
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:11,669
Member Kratz?

17
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:12,369
Here.

18
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,530
Member Graham?

19
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:13,871
Here.

20
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:16,173
Okay, so three present, none absent.

21
00:02:18,335 --> 00:02:26,643
Do we need to wait for anybody else to join from the administrative team before we get started?

22
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:33,470
The superintendent is just logging on right now.

23
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,871
Okay, we can give her a minute.

24
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,692
Thank you.

25
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:57,583
Hi, Superintendent, how are you?

26
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:03,766
Thank you.

27
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:04,927
Good afternoon, everyone.

28
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:14,393
So, Superintendent, we already read the meeting notice and took attendance, so we are ready to go.

29
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:17,064
So we can go ahead and dive right in.

30
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:21,090
I know we only have an hour and we have another subcommittee meeting right after this.

31
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,076
So my thought is that we'll try to keep each of these topics to about 30 minutes.

32
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:30,362
And if we need to follow up in a subsequent meeting, we can do that.

33
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,020
Excellent.

34
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:51,885
Okay, so the first topic is absenteeism and truancy notices and the resolution that was unanimously passed by the school committee is as follows, whereas MPS is required to distribute notifications to caregivers regarding truancy and absenteeism and whereas

35
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:57,794
The Medford School Committee and the MPS administration are committed to creating a collaborative partnership between home and school.

36
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:05,499
Be it resolved that the Family Engagement and Communications Subcommittee will meet to review district communications regarding truancy and absenteeism.

37
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:14,765
The committee will review our regulatory requirements in current communications to ensure there is compliance with regulations and that our letters achieve our objectives of collaborative partnership.

38
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:24,097
So, just by way of a little bit of background on this topic in terms of what we hear from community members in particular.

39
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:34,316
Each year, or at least each year in the past, the district has sent out, there are two things that I'm aware of.

40
00:04:34,396 --> 00:04:54,952
So one is at the beginning of the year, there's a note that goes out from our district attorney, Marion Ryan, about truancy and the consequences of truancy, which go into some detail to include involvement from DCF and other agencies

41
00:04:56,501 --> 00:05:05,404
And then also a requirement that we have to send out notifications once students have missed a certain amount of time under DESE's regulations.

42
00:05:05,444 --> 00:05:08,425
I believe it's, is it five days where the notices go out?

43
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,567
And over the past,

44
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:26,509
year or so, we have, I know I and probably other members of the committee have heard from families, and I know that the administration has as well, around both of those notices, I would say for different reasons.

45
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:35,975
So what I was hoping we could talk about today is really getting to like level footing on what we are required to do.

46
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:38,656
And I think also understanding the spirit.

47
00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:59,061
of what we are trying to accomplish in both of those communications, particularly, Megan, thank you for joining with our Director of Family Engagement on board and to talk about as a district, how do we think about proceeding forward?

48
00:06:00,242 --> 00:06:01,102
So I'll stop there.

49
00:06:01,663 --> 00:06:08,846
I don't know if my fellow committee members have any questions or comments about this topic that they wanted to share before we dive in.

50
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:11,357
Kathy.

51
00:06:11,817 --> 00:06:12,478
Yes, yes.

52
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:13,099
Yep.

53
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:20,089
So I was just reading through some emails we got earlier this year about the absenteeism letters that go out.

54
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:26,078
And, you know, I do agree with some of the concerns and the letters that were mailed out is

55
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:40,659
that we do have the COVID protocols in place where if students are symptomatic, they're close contact, they should remain home and quarantine for the five days.

56
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:50,382
So where the letters are sent out if the students are absent five days, that might be five COVID days.

57
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:55,286
So COVID is new and we haven't updated these letters.

58
00:06:55,346 --> 00:07:03,932
So I do think we need to do some sort of an update or addendum to the required letters by law that we have to send out.

59
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:05,914
I wanted to share that.

60
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:08,576
Same.

61
00:07:08,856 --> 00:07:10,878
I mean, I think we've been getting the same emails.

62
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:14,312
Yeah, exactly.

63
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:23,437
And I guess, you know, before the meeting, I did a little bit of my own digging on the DESE website to try to sort of understand the lay of the land.

64
00:07:23,457 --> 00:07:32,263
So superintendent, you can definitely correct me on this because I expect that you're more an expert on DESE regulation in this regard than I am.

65
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:41,008
But my understanding is that that letter, that five day absence letter is a requirement of DESE, is that correct?

66
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:46,289
Yes, I'm gonna.

67
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:54,060
Sorry, there's a little echo because we're in the same space, I'm going to have Miss Lucy respond first.

68
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:54,521
Thank you.

69
00:07:58,985 --> 00:07:59,666
That's correct.

70
00:07:59,806 --> 00:08:13,334
And so I think what might be just a little important context for this discussion is we have kind of what was in place pre-COVID and then what wasn't in place during COVID.

71
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:22,319
So pre-COVID, there were letters that were created, I believe, with attorney Howard Greenspan.

72
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:26,511
They were at increments of 5, 10, and 15.

73
00:08:27,172 --> 00:08:31,597
So those were the levels in which the letters went home to inform families.

74
00:08:32,238 --> 00:08:34,060
So that piece is correct.

75
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:43,093
During COVID, there were, of course, different circumstances for why students were absent, and there were quarantining needs.

76
00:08:43,313 --> 00:08:50,655
So I do know that those letters, or at least to my knowledge, those letters were not going home during the pandemic.

77
00:08:51,195 --> 00:09:02,678
But in terms of, and I know the DESE has, I believe it was this past February, has put new updates on their website.

78
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:17,822
which I haven't combed through all of it exactly, but in terms of like aligning our policy that we're following here for next year makes sense to me.

79
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:34,007
And is the 5, 10, 15 day threshold total absences or unexcused absences?

80
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:40,214
Um, they're really supposed to be unexcused.

81
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:57,125
Because if there's been a communication or extenuating circumstance so that you have five absences that the building administration or staff is unaware of, then the letter is like a notification piece.

82
00:09:57,165 --> 00:10:03,709
So that first letter is that first one at five unexcused absences is literally just a notification.

83
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:12,361
or it recommends that the family can reach out to have a conversation, but it's not really actionable.

84
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:29,988
When you get to the 10 unexcused absences, that results in a meeting with the school principal and maybe other associated staff, but it kind of builds in the level of notification and need, if that makes sense.

85
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:32,347
Okay.

86
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:55,131
And member Graham, I just wanted to say that during the pandemic, before the CDC changed the regulations, when we were quarantining for the 14 days or the 10 days of school, just by that practice, you had some students that could potentially have missed, they may have had to have quarantined twice or three times.

87
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:59,932
So they exceeded, you know, the total number of days, but those days would have been excused.

88
00:11:01,003 --> 00:11:07,552
So I think during the pandemic, it kind of changed the rules that we were accustomed to using.

89
00:11:08,894 --> 00:11:09,094
Yep.

90
00:11:10,824 --> 00:11:13,166
I think that's really fair.

91
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:34,745
So I think as we look forward to next year around these letters, I think one of the unresolved conflicts in the letters and the approach versus like the public health guidance that people are much more committed to following now is if you feel sick, stay home, right?

92
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:37,207
And I think that's always been a rule, but people,

93
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:42,863
listen to it a little bit more seriously now than they ever have in the past.

94
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:56,769
And so I'm just wondering, and as I was sort of asking myself that question in preparation for the meeting, I actually went into our policy manual and we have one, two, three, four,

95
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:04,095
five policies at the school committee level that address absenteeism and truancy.

96
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:10,881
And I find them to be rather convoluted, honestly, as I read through all of them.

97
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:24,412
And I do think we probably should aim to be a little bit more simple than having five policies about what I think is really maybe two topics, absenteeism and truancy.

98
00:12:26,739 --> 00:12:32,780
So I think we have to, we'll sort of circle back around to those policy issues at the end.

99
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:52,484
But I guess the question is, as we go into next year, how do we reconcile our five, 10, 15 days of unexcused absence with the notion that if you are feeling symptomatic of COVID, which I don't think is gonna go away necessarily, stay home.

100
00:12:55,536 --> 00:13:01,940
most doctors are not engaging in those kinds of conversations to be able to provide a note of absence.

101
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:15,147
So I think I would just want us to be able to be clear about like what constitutes a COVID related excused absence so that that can be reflected in our policy at the beginning of the year.

102
00:13:15,207 --> 00:13:18,429
And then also in terms of how we count those absences as we go on.

103
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,990
I also wanted to say member Graham,

104
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:30,914
Just one second.

105
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:41,147
Sorry about that member Graham, I was going to say, I, I wish I had nurse director Avery Heinz on the call as well because

106
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:50,294
As the virus, COVID is evolving and there are different symptoms that are happening.

107
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:54,536
Sometimes it is the nurses if they're completing a rapid test.

108
00:13:55,016 --> 00:14:08,543
So we have a medical professional that's confirming and verifying that the child is not feeling well or is displaying certain symptoms and to kind of either keep the child at home or keep

109
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,524
an extra eye out on the child.

110
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:24,529
At the same time as we look at the attendance policy I do want us to just be cautious, because also during this time of the pandemic where there was so much.

111
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:44,142
know, exposure and students being in school and out of school from a social emotional learning perspective, I think we have to be careful that if a student potentially were to need additional supports or more help that COVID or COVID exposure

112
00:14:44,582 --> 00:15:00,989
was not going to be used as a reason to stay out of school, because there are that that's another piece where, when it was the original 510 15 days, you never wanted to get to the 15, you never wanted that to happen.

113
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,710
And so the pandemic kind of changed the rules.

114
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:18,989
But now looking at attendance and looking at medical documentation of what we do have what's been submitted to the nurse's office to look at each case, or each situation on a case by case basis.

115
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,132
So I definitely am in support of.

116
00:15:22,373 --> 00:15:37,252
streamlining and aligning the, you know, the five policies to bring it down to one or two policies that the district is going to, you know, hold up as the standard, but at the same time we just also need to be aware that.

117
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:45,629
you know, some absenteeism is not related to, you know, it's not COVID related.

118
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:55,456
It's a very, very small, small number, but it's a number that we do have to closely monitor and report if, you know, it becomes egregious.

119
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,337
So I think that that's kind of,

120
00:15:59,846 --> 00:16:10,075
why those rules were put in place, because sometimes students just, they aren't going to school, and then the next thing you know, unfortunately, they drop out of school.

121
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:11,716
And so, you know, Ms.

122
00:16:11,756 --> 00:16:21,124
Fidler-Carey might be able to speak to that or just say, like, as she and her team and the engagement specialists are really trying to keep students engaged, working with families,

123
00:16:21,544 --> 00:16:29,630
We don't want students dropping out because it's like, oh, I've been out of school 27 days or, you know, whatever the number is.

124
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:33,052
And we have no documentation of what's going on with that student.

125
00:16:35,814 --> 00:16:35,955
Ms.

126
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:37,956
Fidler-Kerry, did you want to speak?

127
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:39,097
Sure.

128
00:16:39,337 --> 00:16:39,537
Yes.

129
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:39,978
Thank you.

130
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:40,258
Yeah.

131
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:41,359
Thank you for the opportunity.

132
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:44,041
Again, so the engagement team has

133
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:56,254
been working very closely with administrators and nurses and mental health professionals in all of the schools to look at everything just like Dr. Edward Vincent says as a case-by-case basis.

134
00:16:56,674 --> 00:17:02,840
So the first thing that most of them do in the morning is review the absence data.

135
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:05,303
So they look for trends, they're looking at kids, they

136
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:34,600
know by now there are definitely certain several kids that they have their eye on that they're watching for the students and then anybody they're concerned about they bring up to they go and check in with the nurses they check in with um the the uh assistant principals to say to find out exactly this do we know is this a student who's shouldn't shouldn't be absent or do we know the reason why they're not here um and they they really paint pictures for each kid and know the stories so they're really

137
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:41,060
It's, it's definitely case by case they're attacking the absentee absences head on.

138
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:42,364
And I've said that.

139
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:45,931
I gave that as an assignment in our second month of school.

140
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:55,640
I said, just as we're getting our feet wet and figuring out what the engagement specialists are going to do, I said, every single day for two weeks, I want you to check the absences and make a sheet.

141
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,925
It was really laborious, but it was good practice to say, I need you to know exactly why every student is absent.

142
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:05,928
And then right next to it, how many days before this they've been absent.

143
00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:08,651
And it was a good exercise just to get their head in it.

144
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:29,897
I think they've they've expressed a lot of concern about the letters to the engagement team has, they brought this up saying, you know, wondering and I'm glad to have this discussion because I don't know that we ever got to the bottom of it, wondering what is the state policy versus the Medford policy about how many days before a letter goes home.

145
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:35,526
what does the language in that letter look like and who determines it?

146
00:18:36,206 --> 00:18:37,386
And is there a way to change it?

147
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:48,129
Is there a way to give different letters to different families based on how cooperative they've been or how receptive they've been to our offers for resources?

148
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:52,950
So I think there is a lot to discuss and a lot of decisions to make.

149
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:58,571
And I'm really glad to make the point, because we were confused by the five policies as well.

150
00:18:58,891 --> 00:19:00,752
We looked at all of them and it,

151
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:02,613
It was overwhelming.

152
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:05,574
So I'm glad to hear that your will make this more concise.

153
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:11,798
And I'm glad to get their feedback to bring to bring back to you as you're working on these policies, too.

154
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:23,464
But there's definitely a lot more of a practice of, you know, sort of shared case conferencing about students among the professionals.

155
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:25,225
So not only at the school level,

156
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:39,292
But I'm Dr. Denver's friend son brought up every Heinz and I was thinking of her too, because we meet as hub directors, so all of the directors from the different departments meet once a week as well and and sort of check in to make sure.

157
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:46,014
from our perspective in our different departments, are these conversations actually happening the way that we hope them to?

158
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:50,396
Is there different methods or policies that we'd like to see in place?

159
00:19:50,776 --> 00:20:07,286
So I would, you know, I'm happy to bring up at the next hub meeting when I'll bring up to Avery to say, you know, what are the changing ideas about the staying home if you don't feel good policy and like, you know, what's coming from the state level, what's coming from medical,

160
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:13,327
practices medical best practices and what should we put in writing and what do we want to adopt I think that's a great idea.

161
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:20,398
Thank you, so I think in terms of next steps.

162
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:25,978
As it relates to this conversation, I think there's maybe two components.

163
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:31,301
One is to revisit the letters, and it sounds like maybe Ms.

164
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:42,049
Fidler-Carey's team might be best to take a crack at what those letters might say and bring it back to this group for review, Superintendent, if you're in agreement with that.

165
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:54,657
And then the other thing that I think we should do is we should bring these five policies to the school committee with a recommendation that this group will continue to work through policy revision on them.

166
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,479
And so there are five that I was able to find.

167
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:02,602
There's JEC, which is the high school class attendance policy.

168
00:21:03,732 --> 00:21:08,195
There's JED, which is the middle school class attendance and tardiness policy.

169
00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:14,760
There's JF-R, uniform registration and attendance.

170
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:26,108
Then there's JHBA, the duties of the supervisor of attendance and JHB, truancy.

171
00:21:27,022 --> 00:21:39,536
So I think if my colleagues are in agreement, we would put a motion on the agenda to ask this committee to conduct the review of those five policies and recommend changes.

172
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:46,123
So, Member Kretz, Member McLaughlin, do you have any questions or comments on that?

173
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:50,304
Great idea.

174
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:50,905
Oh, sorry.

175
00:21:52,086 --> 00:21:52,686
Okay, Kathy.

176
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:57,390
So can I ask one of you to make a motion to well actually I just had.

177
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:00,393
Yeah, I did just have one question so we're gonna.

178
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:10,282
So if I'm understanding you correctly you want to make a proposal to the school committee that we review the policies on the five or so policies on the current

179
00:22:11,536 --> 00:22:15,318
policy and make a recommendation to the school committee based on that.

180
00:22:15,478 --> 00:22:19,579
It doesn't have to go to like another like rules policy subcommittee, nothing like that.

181
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,360
We make the policy recommendation.

182
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,260
Correct.

183
00:22:23,561 --> 00:22:23,781
Yeah.

184
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:35,325
So I make a motion that we move forward the policy review for the absenteeism and truism through the subcommittee to make a recommendation.

185
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:41,457
Okay, so motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kretz.

186
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:43,365
Member Kretz?

187
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:46,198
Yes.

188
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:46,658
Roll call.

189
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:47,578
I'm sorry.

190
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:49,859
I'm a member of Laughlin.

191
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:50,979
I was like, who?

192
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,420
A member grant, yes.

193
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,160
Okay, so three in the affirmative, zero negative.

194
00:22:57,141 --> 00:23:03,802
We'll add that as part of the readout to ask the committee to make an official vote on that so that we can continue that work.

195
00:23:05,162 --> 00:23:06,163
And then Ms.

196
00:23:06,183 --> 00:23:15,765
Fidler-Carrie, I will perhaps connect with you about the timing that you feel like you'll need to do your work before we're able to all come back together.

197
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:36,735
The other piece of this conversation that I wanted to make sure we didn't run out of time for is the letter from Mary and Ryan that goes out at the beginning of the year and each year that it goes out, there definitely is a flurry of question and concern.

198
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:44,119
When I looked on the DESE website, I could not see anywhere that required that a letter from the district attorney

199
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:54,536
go out regarding absenteeism, but I wanted to confirm that with with you all that that is not a regulatory requirement that we need to comply with.

200
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:10,782
Past practice, I know that we've normally sent the DA's communication out to the community as well.

201
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:16,805
You're asking specifically if we are required by DESE to send that communication as well.

202
00:24:24,848 --> 00:24:28,490
I can definitely try to, that's something I can find out because I know normally when we,

203
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:37,461
receive communications from the DA's office, we always forward it to that constituency.

204
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:39,262
Usually, it's to the secondary students.

205
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:44,505
But I can work on finding out if that is an expectation.

206
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:51,047
I can reach out to DESE and just see, do they feel, if it's coming from the district attorney's office, then

207
00:24:53,202 --> 00:25:10,449
you know, because the departments I believe work kind of in collaboration or in coordination, that I wouldn't think that a communication coming from, you know, one department would really be contrary or opposed to the other.

208
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:17,052
Are you asking that we not send, only send communications that are required by DESE?

209
00:25:17,112 --> 00:25:18,473
Is that what you're recommending right now?

210
00:25:19,396 --> 00:25:23,398
So I guess what I'm trying to understand is, what are we required to do?

211
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:26,119
Because I think it's important that we're compliant.

212
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:40,345
If I could like intuit the intent of that letter, it's to set the tone at the beginning of the year that we expect students to come to school and work hard, right?

213
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:46,028
I think there are a thousand ways to achieve that objective without,

214
00:25:47,215 --> 00:25:56,183
threatening DCF involvement in your family, which is the feedback that I get from parents with this letter.

215
00:25:56,704 --> 00:26:08,214
So I think in the spirit of, and I am completely supportive of being proactive and setting a tone from the district that says these are our policies around attendance.

216
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:29,126
Every single year so that people know what they are and know what to expect and they know the difference between an excuse and an unexcused absence and that definition probably you know it's likely to change over time, you know, as we have seen, but I think my question is, can we move to something a little bit more family centered.

217
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:37,040
in our pursuit to disseminate our policy than a note from law enforcement.

218
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:53,393
I feel like it just sort of jumps way down the line of severity when by and large, what we're trying to do is communicate what our policy is, and the letter itself doesn't actually communicate our policy.

219
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:55,194
So we're sending this letter

220
00:26:58,055 --> 00:27:04,676
in a sort of big brothery kind of way, but what the letter doesn't actually do is help people understand what our policy is.

221
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:14,859
So I think my question is, could we move to something that is more effective and less stressful to some of our families?

222
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:18,519
And maybe that's something Ms.

223
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,300
Fidler-Curry would be willing to work with us on, but member McLaughlin.

224
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:34,549
Yeah, I appreciate that, especially working on a number of family and community engagement initiatives with the mass spec at the state level talking about, you know, sort of DCF and sort of the role that

225
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:42,056
DCF plays and even trying to build family engagement around DCF and other other folks right like it's a really important and much needed issue.

226
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:54,182
And when people hear that obviously there's a knee jerk response right like there's a that automatically makes the relationship strained between school and family, even, you know, under

227
00:27:54,702 --> 00:27:57,444
any circumstances, even if it's just sort of a process circumstance.

228
00:27:58,085 --> 00:28:23,422
So I do think it's an important issue to address, and perhaps if it's something that the DA does need to be looped in on for whatever reason that perhaps we're unaware of, it could even be just a further discussion with the District Attorney's Office on how to consider making that a more family-centered response from the District Attorney's Office, even as a way of introduction or

229
00:28:23,906 --> 00:28:29,730
you know, something and saying, is there, if there's anything we can do to support or whatever, but, and also stating the policy.

230
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:50,123
So if there's a procedural, you know, process that we're unaware of that needs to happen for some reason that we don't know about that we can find out more about either through Megan or Dr. Maurice or the district attorney's office, then that said, it would be worth having a further conversation about how to make that more friendly.

231
00:28:52,433 --> 00:29:05,203
And I was just going to say member Graham in response to member McLaughlin suggestion I the DA's office they speak with me frequently I work and participate in different things that they offer.

232
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:10,428
So I definitely would be willing to present that feedback to the DA's office.

233
00:29:11,988 --> 00:29:31,894
As I was thinking about it and where you were talking about the letter being harsh and thinking just about, you know, the entire jurisdiction, when she sends out communications, it's not only like Medford, it's to like 52 cities and towns or something like that.

234
00:29:32,294 --> 00:29:33,854
It's a very, very large number.

235
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:38,516
And so there are different things, of course, happening in different pockets.

236
00:29:40,357 --> 00:29:40,877
of the state.

237
00:29:41,477 --> 00:29:50,461
So again, some of the harsher language might be because it's going out to a much, you know, wider group of people.

238
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:53,042
So I can definitely take that.

239
00:29:54,663 --> 00:30:00,186
you know, take that feedback and share that feedback so that we can look at making it more family friendly.

240
00:30:00,266 --> 00:30:20,299
But I do also wanna say that, again, it's a very, very small percentage in Medford, but sometimes we do, if we're not able, you know, through meeting with families and trying to, you know, have this active communication and engagement,

241
00:30:21,372 --> 00:30:29,455
On some occasions, or in some occasions, some situations and circumstances, we do have to involve the Department of Children and Families.

242
00:30:29,515 --> 00:30:43,920
So I don't want to pretend that, you know, for an entire district of 4,000 students, we never have to pick up the phone call, pick up the phone and make that call, because we are, as educators, we are all mandated reporters.

243
00:30:45,139 --> 00:31:03,988
So in some very, very few cases where we haven't been able to come to agreement and students with significant absences and we're not able, we do end up having to go that route, not often.

244
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:08,650
It's the exception and not the norm, but it does happen in some,

245
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:15,978
In some cases, so I do want to just you know be transparent in saying that.

246
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:28,032
You know, especially with the work of our engagement team we work really, really hard trying to keep kids engaged not having students want to drop out and trying to make sure that they're coming to school.

247
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:35,180
But in some cases, there are a small number that is kind of falling through the cracks.

248
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:40,441
And we do have to sometimes take a stronger approach to address it.

249
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,142
Yeah, completely understood.

250
00:31:44,182 --> 00:31:47,363
And I think there's likely a way

251
00:31:50,226 --> 00:32:06,545
To have that letter authored by you that reflects our policies and our practices that you know handle like the majority of our students and the issues we're going to encounter in the course of a school year, and then provide a link to.

252
00:32:07,846 --> 00:32:17,691
DA Ryan's letter, which does include a whole bunch of legalese about the law around the requirements to send your kids to school.

253
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:22,734
So I think it's important that we provide that information for those who are interested in reading it.

254
00:32:22,754 --> 00:32:31,558
I just think fronting with that information loses the message about partnership collaboration and what our policies are here in Medford.

255
00:32:31,598 --> 00:32:36,761
So I think there's a way to accomplish all those things as long as we are clear about what the requirements are.

256
00:32:37,942 --> 00:32:45,468
But I want the communication to be about what is happening here in Medford and what our commitments are to family engagement.

257
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:50,572
And I feel like the current approach is like not quite getting us there.

258
00:32:50,652 --> 00:32:53,894
So a revision to that, I think would be welcome.

259
00:32:54,855 --> 00:32:56,396
Member McLaughlin, did you have your hand in the air?

260
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:09,199
I just wanted to say the appreciation for what the superintendent was sharing about and I know that member Graham and members understand this as well.

261
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:23,389
But you know those those children that can fall through the cracks I mean we see that harmony Montgomery case right how many times how many, you know that school really, you know, school school systems failed her, you know, and we don't want that to happen with any of our children of course so.

262
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:25,250
are students, of course.

263
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,672
So there is a fine line.

264
00:33:26,692 --> 00:33:31,798
But I do think the fronting piece is the piece that we really need to get across that this is a caring community.

265
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:38,185
And you know, one that wants to support the families and have the family centered message, and then the additional information.

266
00:33:38,265 --> 00:33:41,148
So, but I can appreciate where you're coming from as well.

267
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:42,902
Dr. Edwardson, thank you.

268
00:33:43,382 --> 00:33:43,722
Thank you.

269
00:33:43,742 --> 00:34:04,770
And I think if we take a holistic approach to this letter and the 5, 10, 15 day letter that we were talking about, there's probably an opportunity to be progressive in how much of that information we are putting in each of those subsequent letters when we have families that we are really concerned about so that those things can be formally documented as well.

270
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:11,213
So sort of considering all of that as a package of communication, I think is really important too.

271
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:24,383
Okay, so in terms of next steps, superintendent, you will do a little bit of investigating about the requirement from a regulatory perspective.

272
00:34:25,724 --> 00:34:26,024
And Ms.

273
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:30,687
Fidler-Carey, I will connect with you about timing in terms of our next meeting.

274
00:34:31,107 --> 00:34:36,991
And then we will put that resolution to review those policies on the school committee, the next school committee agenda.

275
00:34:37,391 --> 00:34:40,633
And then this group will reconvene at some point in the next few months.

276
00:34:42,483 --> 00:34:45,565
Any other questions or comments about topic number one.

277
00:34:51,249 --> 00:34:52,910
Okay.

278
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,371
So topic number two.

279
00:34:56,332 --> 00:35:01,496
The the resolution passed by the school committee is whereas the communications engagement and strategic planning subcommittee.

280
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:06,020
met on 12-1-2020 to discuss the district communication strategy.

281
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:29,355
And whereas during that meeting, the administration discussed goals for a new and comprehensive platform to manage communications and the need for a new website, be it resolved that the Family Engagement and Communication Subcommittee will meet to review the progress to date, understand current efforts, discuss future efforts, and identify funding requirements to meet the goal of having a cohesive communication strategy that meets the needs of families and the district.

282
00:35:30,974 --> 00:35:41,404
So I was hoping in this meeting we could hear some updates I think back in 2020, which does feel a little bit like a lifetime ago.

283
00:35:42,505 --> 00:35:48,530
There was a new, you all were considering a new platform which would have been implemented in the summer.

284
00:35:49,971 --> 00:35:52,652
of 21 that would have consolidated communications.

285
00:35:52,712 --> 00:36:03,476
And I just wanted us to start with getting a better understanding of where you all are in that process, whether it's been delayed or where we're at, so that we can think about the upcoming needs.

286
00:36:04,982 --> 00:36:07,963
Yeah, so to your point, yes.

287
00:36:08,123 --> 00:36:13,765
And of course the pandemic did cause some delays, but there has been significant progress.

288
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:29,411
There is a lot of work happening right now with the district hoping to transition to a new vendor, final site, a more robust vendor with greater capacities, greater flexibility.

289
00:36:29,891 --> 00:36:34,073
And so there has been significant progress on that front.

290
00:36:34,613 --> 00:36:48,623
And so at a future engagement meeting, we would love to be able to update you, the entire committee, on where we are currently in the work that we're doing.

291
00:36:48,763 --> 00:36:58,090
And we are hoping, significant progress has been made, but we are hoping to be able to launch this new site by the summer of 22.

292
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,852
So this coming summer is our anticipated

293
00:37:03,553 --> 00:37:08,436
timeline of launching the new site.

294
00:37:09,277 --> 00:37:20,503
But we would love to be able to get that in front of you, you know, maybe in six weeks time or a month's time to be able to show this group the progress.

295
00:37:20,563 --> 00:37:26,027
I can say from what I've seen thus far, it's much

296
00:37:26,727 --> 00:37:31,632
cleaner, user-friendly, and very, very proud.

297
00:37:32,073 --> 00:37:36,838
Many of our vocational students have had the opportunity

298
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:46,466
Graphics, Lisa Miller working with her students, our media students, adding videos.

299
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:53,513
So there's a lot of student involvement, student engagement, I should say, in this new website platform.

300
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:55,155
It's user-friendly.

301
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:16,294
There is like a scope and sequence that they are working on for how we would be able to roll it out to the district and really work on significantly improving and increasing communication at a district level and providing families with more than one platform to

302
00:38:18,354 --> 00:38:21,376
hear and receive information about what's happening in the district.

303
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:27,438
So I was really excited about the last draft presentation that I was able to see.

304
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:40,545
And I think that this body will be equally excited to see that this is modern, it's sleek, it's clean, the pictures are vibrant, and it's logical.

305
00:38:41,806 --> 00:38:45,948
Very, very logical, very, very clean, very user-friendly, and

306
00:38:47,738 --> 00:38:52,622
You know, although the last website was a significant improvement from the original version.

307
00:38:52,642 --> 00:39:02,310
This new website that they have been working on is even significantly more improved than what we're accustomed to.

308
00:39:09,085 --> 00:39:10,186
Hello, I apologize.

309
00:39:10,446 --> 00:39:14,988
I'm in transit to get my daughter to soccer practice, so I apologize for not having my camera on.

310
00:39:15,008 --> 00:39:26,655
But I also wanted to say that as part of our district communication plan, we're actually right now working on a marketing communications plan to present probably to this group in the next meeting.

311
00:39:27,476 --> 00:39:29,877
We'll do some internal reviews and then be able to share out.

312
00:39:29,957 --> 00:39:37,101
That is spelled out in the strategic plan as something that we will have connected to the strategic plan.

313
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:44,504
Right now, we use School Messenger as our mass communication system.

314
00:39:45,264 --> 00:39:48,787
And we were considering switching that up to go with another vendor.

315
00:39:49,407 --> 00:39:52,989
And one of the things, hold on one second, I apologize.

316
00:40:00,574 --> 00:40:01,615
So I apologize for that.

317
00:40:01,755 --> 00:40:06,878
But we're also looking because final site offers mass communication.

318
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:14,505
text messaging, phone calls, emails, all the broadcast systems that right now reside with School Messenger.

319
00:40:14,665 --> 00:40:29,788
School Messenger, in my experience, as was just shown about three weeks ago when we put out some signs of suicide information, for some people that email came through fine, for a lot of people that email came through as massive when you were trying to look at the images.

320
00:40:30,288 --> 00:40:36,630
Hopefully, Final Sight's mass communication system will offer us a consistent platform

321
00:40:37,057 --> 00:40:49,020
to really work across that's connected to our website, connected to our social media feeds, and gives parents and community members a seamless experience of communication with their schools and their districts.

322
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:52,295
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

323
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:59,277
That was actually going to be one of my first questions, which was like, what is the scope of what final site is providing to us?

324
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:12,920
So it sounds like we are planning to use their website platform for sure, and we're still considering the communications pieces, or have we already made that decision?

325
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:14,813
No, it's under consideration.

326
00:41:14,853 --> 00:41:35,718
The issue with the communications systems and having worked with this previously, not the person responsible for it, switching that is not something to be taken lightly because when it goes wrong, your district loses the ability to get an emergency message out.

327
00:41:36,258 --> 00:41:42,040
So it's just something that we wanna make sure is done very thoughtfully, very carefully and has appropriate

328
00:41:43,392 --> 00:41:53,082
fail safes in place and that might just mean carrying over school messenger for a month or two while we onboard a new system to make sure that everything's working well.

329
00:41:54,203 --> 00:41:54,503
Sure.

330
00:41:56,865 --> 00:42:02,190
The other questions that I had around some of the work that you all are doing

331
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:18,207
in regard to the budget is I think it's wonderful that students have an opportunity to participate in this process, especially those in the related vocational teams, but students move on.

332
00:42:18,807 --> 00:42:27,430
And I do feel like we need to have a sustainable way to keep the integrity of our information where we want it to be.

333
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:33,312
And I think in all fairness that putting that responsibility on students and

334
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:39,333
in classrooms from year to year to year is not a way necessarily to do that.

335
00:42:39,373 --> 00:42:55,123
So I think one question I had is what sort of central supports are you all planning on so that we don't solely rely on students who have their own learning curriculum that they need to be worried about?

336
00:42:56,175 --> 00:42:57,076
So I work Vincent.

337
00:42:57,516 --> 00:42:58,656
Yes, member Graham.

338
00:42:59,137 --> 00:43:07,421
Yes, I wanted to share that in this new iteration, it's definitely more built out more robust.

339
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:18,287
One of the things that with this upcoming shift to a new more robust system, each school is going to have a lead

340
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:27,293
technology support staff person affiliated with the new platform.

341
00:43:27,573 --> 00:43:31,676
So to your point of, you know, students will graduate those kinds of things.

342
00:43:31,736 --> 00:43:42,242
Yes, they will, but there's also going to be a much larger team that will be working directly with communications on a school by school basis.

343
00:43:42,442 --> 00:43:44,504
And so now we're going to have a broader

344
00:43:45,825 --> 00:43:47,586
school based communication team.

345
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:54,853
So that is one shift that we are in the process of making for next for next school year.

346
00:43:55,194 --> 00:44:03,461
And we've already identified individuals that are highly skilled with technology and have

347
00:44:05,323 --> 00:44:16,590
excitedly taken on this charge to be part of this process as we are really trying to just evolve and have a truly comprehensive communication system.

348
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:27,176
So I feel very encouraged by this new team of individuals that will also be helping to support and work with us in terms of communications.

349
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:31,618
And will that team be

350
00:44:35,453 --> 00:44:37,233
teachers or administrators?

351
00:44:37,273 --> 00:44:45,915
Like what is your vision for how folks in each of the schools will be like rolling into this effort?

352
00:44:49,635 --> 00:44:53,396
So I was gonna say, oh, Mr. Murphy, did you wanna, you want to comment?

353
00:44:53,636 --> 00:44:54,576
Let me let Mr. Murphy.

354
00:44:55,016 --> 00:45:05,078
I'll just, to the superintendent's point, I mean, the choice to go with this new external vendor for the website

355
00:45:05,801 --> 00:45:10,443
is an attempt to professionalize our web-based presence.

356
00:45:11,103 --> 00:45:30,232
And in professionalizing that, a lot of work becomes a lot easier because we have essentially external, for lack of a better term, although this might actually be the correct term, customer service representatives from final site who are assigned to Medford and help manage the technical aspects of the work.

357
00:45:30,572 --> 00:45:33,293
So that takes that part of the burden

358
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:39,496
that we've been shouldering off of our internal team.

359
00:45:40,116 --> 00:45:46,680
At the same time, it opens up new opportunities to communicate via these platforms.

360
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:57,967
And to Dr. Cushing's point, hopefully a proliferation of platforms managed in a way that we can target, offer targeted messaging in when appropriate broad-based messaging.

361
00:45:58,377 --> 00:46:16,395
So that the school based team is essentially a one per building stipend in position to an internal staff member who's embedded in that school community and then can take direction from that school leader to make sure that there are timely relevant.

362
00:46:16,723 --> 00:46:22,844
and compelling updates so that all of our school communities are able to benefit from this investment we've made in the vendor.

363
00:46:23,224 --> 00:46:33,166
There will obviously, there'll still be a centralized component of that, that will function in coordination with the superintendent's office so that when we have organizational wide messaging, we're using that.

364
00:46:33,246 --> 00:46:43,048
But in terms of sort of how that work is divided up, it's a combination of the customer service personnel that are now essentially work for us as an outside vendor.

365
00:46:43,605 --> 00:46:51,311
and then the team of individuals who will be responsible for helping to manage their individual school communities' messaging.

366
00:46:51,531 --> 00:47:08,744
But their work, while they happen to, in many cases, be the technology teacher and has a certain level of familiarity and so on and so forth, it's really the principal's office that is responsible for sort of prioritizing and crafting that message.

367
00:47:09,131 --> 00:47:20,154
And then the modest stipend positions at each school are sort of doing the execution of that work so that we have a level of consistency across each of our school communities.

368
00:47:20,214 --> 00:47:35,177
Because if we just made this investment and told our school communities, okay, we've got a new website now, here's a how-to list as to how to post, you're gonna invariably, it doesn't matter if there's eight schools or 125, you're gonna have inconsistency.

369
00:47:35,237 --> 00:47:37,478
Some schools are gonna use the platform, some aren't.

370
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:38,638
So this team,

371
00:47:39,172 --> 00:48:00,216
is gonna be, we're gonna be working with them in coordination with final site, so they have an understanding as to what our priorities are, what's the how-to, and then we're working with principals over the summer when we come back to school to make sure that they know that the reason we've made this investment is for us to improve our overall communication with primarily families, but all stakeholders.

372
00:48:01,897 --> 00:48:02,617
Great, thank you.

373
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:03,337
Thanks.

374
00:48:03,777 --> 00:48:07,218
Member McLaughlin, Member Kratz, do you have any questions so far?

375
00:48:11,191 --> 00:48:13,172
No, this has been all very, very interesting.

376
00:48:13,232 --> 00:48:16,473
I really appreciate all the information that we've received today.

377
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:17,154
Thank you.

378
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:27,658
Dr. Edward-Vincent, the other question I had is, you know, I think websites have two, like, important components.

379
00:48:27,758 --> 00:48:33,360
One is, like, the structure and the look and the feel, and the other is, like, the quality of the content.

380
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:48,666
And I was curious if you could talk to us a little bit about how you have engaged families as you have called through content or what your plans are to engage families for feedback.

381
00:48:49,266 --> 00:48:58,230
I feel like I have heard from folks over time, particularly folks that don't go to Medford public schools and are trying to learn about us.

382
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:11,295
I can't make heads or tails of the content on the website, so I'm just curious like what efforts there have been to actually engage families both inside and outside of the district.

383
00:49:12,707 --> 00:49:36,766
So I think anecdotally hearing feedback, some of that feedback, like what you said, people trying is scrolling down, not knowing where the right tab is, where do you find something that this, the last draft that I saw, it is so much, when I say it was so much more streamlined, sleek and clean and user-friendly, it's,

384
00:49:38,808 --> 00:49:50,112
like the difference I'm not trying to make a commercial but between an Android and Apple, where, you know, Apple is kind of sometimes has the reputation of just being like more user friendly more intuitive.

385
00:49:50,712 --> 00:49:55,074
So that that piece of it is definitely.

386
00:49:57,736 --> 00:49:59,097
definitely readily available.

387
00:49:59,237 --> 00:50:21,409
And I also think the fact that we're now working with Final Sight, where we have access to, I think, more highly skilled individuals, people with greater expertise, that they have also been able to give really solid website feedback in terms of like, this is what needs to happen.

388
00:50:21,509 --> 00:50:25,791
But an actual pilot just yet or

389
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:32,778
Maybe a survey or a platform with families, a meeting with families.

390
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:43,550
As of yet, to my knowledge, I don't believe that that has happened yet because it's still in a draft phase, but I would definitely say when we have

391
00:50:46,262 --> 00:50:49,905
you know, the more corrected version presented to this body.

392
00:50:50,605 --> 00:50:56,550
And this body has an opportunity to kind of see it in action and, you know, give feedback.

393
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:15,904
And maybe as that particular meeting is coming up, maybe to spend a little more time saying to families as well, please jump on this particular subcommittee meeting because we're going to be piloting or doing a demonstration of our new website that's expected to come

394
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:36,798
in the summer of 22, and we're looking for feedback and create, you know, use this platform as an opportunity, or from that presentation, create, you know, an additional opportunity to get feedback and have people, you know, look at it and see the interface and say like, oh, this is excellent, or, oh, don't forget about something to consider.

395
00:51:36,938 --> 00:51:41,301
Is there a way to add X, Y, or Z before we try to take it live?

396
00:51:41,941 --> 00:51:43,662
So definitely open to that.

397
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,584
to receiving additional feedback, definitely open to it.

398
00:51:48,404 --> 00:51:49,504
Yeah, I think that would be great.

399
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:59,506
I think it will be helpful for us to like publicize that opportunity in this meeting.

400
00:51:59,606 --> 00:52:07,388
And I think we would be probably like, I'm thinking likely to get folks within the district interested in like participating in that discussion.

401
00:52:07,988 --> 00:52:13,069
What I am curious about though, is like whether we would be successful in getting

402
00:52:14,751 --> 00:52:27,276
people who are not in the district to engage in this kind of a meeting and how we reach out to, and I don't have any particular suggestions, but how we reach out and find families.

403
00:52:27,636 --> 00:52:35,439
And I'm thinking specifically of the new families who are trying to think about, do I go to Medford Public Schools or do I try to get into a charter school?

404
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:43,602
The charter school websites do a big job of making people feel compelled

405
00:52:43,998 --> 00:52:46,260
to engage in their charter school.

406
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:52,425
And I think, by contrast, like our websites never sort of gone after that same aim.

407
00:52:52,445 --> 00:52:58,791
And so I think folks, you know, there may be some folks in the community who might be

408
00:52:59,411 --> 00:53:13,743
willing to chat with us informally or outside of a meeting, but I would be really interested in their feedback too, because I think there is a population of people who never like walk through the door that are also looking at our website.

409
00:53:13,763 --> 00:53:17,586
And I wanna make sure we're thinking about their input and feedback too.

410
00:53:17,606 --> 00:53:19,467
Member McLaughlin.

411
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:26,393
Yeah, I think this is a really interesting point and important point regarding

412
00:53:28,045 --> 00:53:34,987
families being involved in the process and, you know, there is the, the mass family engagement center.

413
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:47,111
That's not far from here it's just in Charlestown but it's a statewide one and they offer lots of supports and services so I know, Miss fellow carry has done some training with mass spec.

414
00:53:48,572 --> 00:53:58,344
And I'm sure if there were, for example, what you're saying is, you know, whether there would be some folks who would consider looking at a pilot website with family community engagement feedback.

415
00:53:58,384 --> 00:54:07,075
I mean, there's a whole resource community at MassVAC that is just constituents that are all family and engagement

416
00:54:07,475 --> 00:54:17,967
coordinators and community members, but also families from other districts, you know, people that are looking and doing comparative analysis of family and community engagement across districts.

417
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:20,711
So I definitely think it's something that, you know,

418
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:27,994
If you guys are interested in having some feedback and looking at feedback, they'd be available to help support that too.

419
00:54:28,034 --> 00:54:35,058
They've been more than helpful in offering support, really trying to move family and community engagement forward across multiple districts.

420
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:41,462
They've mentored programs, they have a whole bunch of things, but I think specific to the website and looking at sort of how to engage people.

421
00:54:42,143 --> 00:54:49,007
I just shared in the chat, the BPS example, that was from a Mass Effect training as well, but there's a lot of resources there too.

422
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:51,310
that I'm sure we could capitalize on.

423
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:54,791
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

424
00:54:55,111 --> 00:55:04,835
I think your chat comment also brings up a question about what our strategic plans are for the website in terms of language translation.

425
00:55:04,855 --> 00:55:11,277
And I didn't know, Superintendent, what the vision is there or what the roadmap is.

426
00:55:12,433 --> 00:55:32,809
And if, and if we can also decide accessibility to because there is a whole contingency around accessibility with, you know, not just language but around and I don't know I'm not an expert in this field at all but there are plenty that are around, you know, for people who are either vision impaired or, you know, hearing impaired any of those things there's there's certain standards that.

427
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:38,573
You can go by when you're building and certainly the website people who know you know who are building.

428
00:55:39,353 --> 00:55:48,980
Some of them know it, some of them don't, but there are certainly experts out there who do so if I could just add that to member Graham language, language and accessibility.

429
00:55:49,758 --> 00:55:54,579
So for languages, it definitely will be able to be translated into multiple languages.

430
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:57,100
And I'll say a little spoiler alert.

431
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:08,202
I was trying to keep some surprises, but I was really excited by the draft presentation that we got to see and the significant progress that was made.

432
00:56:09,003 --> 00:56:14,184
There is a plan to actually try to slowly roll out

433
00:56:15,344 --> 00:56:19,426
you know, multiple ways of communicating and where you were talking about accessibility.

434
00:56:19,907 --> 00:56:30,513
Not everyone has a computer or a desktop where they have access to that all the time, but almost everyone does have a good old cell phone.

435
00:56:31,594 --> 00:56:33,214
One, if not two, if you're lucky.

436
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:44,041
And so we are definitely, this new platform will also have a component that is cell phone

437
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:45,181
friendly.

438
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:55,605
So from an accessibility in terms of access where, you know, I'm sure 97% of our community has access to a cellular phone.

439
00:56:57,506 --> 00:57:12,471
I'm sure that not only parents and caregivers, but also students, especially at the secondary level, because I know some elementary students may not have cell phones, but for our students as well, they would be able to download the app

440
00:57:13,502 --> 00:57:24,865
and have the downloaded app version of the website available so that they would be able to receive feeds and, you know, important pieces of information related to the school.

441
00:57:25,165 --> 00:57:31,507
So there is, um, you know, I gave a little bit of a spoiler alert but there are definitely a lot of

442
00:57:33,407 --> 00:57:35,689
additional functionality that isn't available.

443
00:57:36,210 --> 00:57:43,057
I also had asked about the text messaging option, which is critically important.

444
00:57:43,117 --> 00:57:47,241
When we just, you know, got off of the April break and

445
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:57,006
you know, I got an alert for my child to just say don't forget to conduct your rapid testing it's Sunday.

446
00:57:57,526 --> 00:58:06,751
So something as simple as that a very, very brief text message that wouldn't take up that much space, but just another way for

447
00:58:07,218 --> 00:58:29,555
know to communicate with families it would be one-sided but it would just be oh remember this is happening in your building or this particular event is happening so really hoping to eventually get to that level of functionality where it doesn't only have to always be an email but you know all the time we're checking our text messages because we get a little alert and using that functionality again to

448
00:58:30,516 --> 00:58:49,311
be able to communicate with parents on timely events, not oversaturate their text message inbox with a million messages a day, but those particular messages where you may want to say, here's a little reminder, and you see it and you're like, oh yeah, I need to do this.

449
00:58:51,613 --> 00:58:52,453
communicate with them.

450
00:58:52,534 --> 00:58:55,135
So we definitely are in agreement.

451
00:58:55,555 --> 00:59:12,183
And I do feel the direction that we're moving in is really going to put us in a much stronger position to provide accessibility, language translation, and keep our families informed, and up to date on what's happening in the district.

452
00:59:14,144 --> 00:59:14,905
Great, thank you.

453
00:59:16,145 --> 00:59:18,226
The other thing that I just wanted to mention,

454
00:59:20,141 --> 00:59:41,838
because it actually came up I was in another meeting last evening with some community members and when we talked originally about this topic we talked about sort of a stretch goal if you will that there would be some availability for our PTOs to engage on the messaging side of things in some way shape or form and I think at the time

455
00:59:42,538 --> 01:00:03,123
What we talked about is, you know, PTOs having access to be able to send emails and things like that in some fashion that would take advantage of folks who have opted into that kind of a communication, but require sort of one-stop shopping for families to submit their information.

456
01:00:03,143 --> 01:00:08,265
And then an actual platform for PTOs, there are some PTOs who,

457
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:14,845
have and manage their own platforms, which is really time consuming.

458
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:23,132
But, and then there are others, and I was talking to members of the community last night in communities where they don't have that.

459
01:00:23,212 --> 01:00:30,978
And so it's very, very difficult for them to engage their communities and create community amongst folks.

460
01:00:30,998 --> 01:00:35,022
So it's, you know, they sort of talk about the same usual set of suspects and it's just sort of a,

461
01:00:35,418 --> 01:00:36,419
bigger part of the conversation.

462
01:00:36,459 --> 01:00:45,231
So I just want to put that like bug out into the world so that as you talk with some final site, perhaps they have some options there as well that we could consider.

463
01:00:45,251 --> 01:00:51,779
And it is five o'clock and I don't want us to go over because I know Member McLaughlin and I both have another meeting to get to.

464
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,621
So is there a motion to adjourn?

465
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:59,094
And I just add one thing when you go to the website folks to just in terms of the accessibility.

466
01:00:59,514 --> 01:01:11,323
So there are options that can have you can just simple options like you can do image descriptions there are simple options where you can do text readers like they're embedded in the thing so that people who are not able to hear or see, you know, that kind of thing.

467
01:01:11,343 --> 01:01:12,944
Okay, thank you just making sure we understand.

468
01:01:13,284 --> 01:01:14,125
So motion to adjourn.

469
01:01:16,135 --> 01:01:19,416
Motion to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kretz.

470
01:01:19,557 --> 01:01:21,297
Roll call, so Member Kretz?

471
01:01:22,098 --> 01:01:22,258
Yes.

472
01:01:23,218 --> 01:01:24,019
Member McLaughlin?

473
01:01:24,439 --> 01:01:24,779
Yes.

474
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:25,899
And Member Graham?

475
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:26,500
Yes.

476
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,680
Thanks, everyone.

477
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,081
Three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

478
01:01:29,121 --> 01:01:29,741
Meeting is adjourned.

479
01:01:29,981 --> 01:01:30,421
Have a good night.

480
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:31,422
All right, bye, have a good night.
