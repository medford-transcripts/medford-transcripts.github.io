    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2493.129s">I</a>  would like to begin this evening with a reflection on the challenging week that so many in our community have experienced with the outbreak of war in Israel. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2504.375s">As</a>  this conflict continues to escalate, we should take some time to think about how the news from Israel and Palestine might affect our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2515.683s">More</a>  and more of the devastation and violence is being shown on social media, from news outlets to individual accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2523.946s">Content</a>  moderators on many platforms are overwhelmed and ill-equipped, meaning that all social media users are likely to encounter graphic or misleading content. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2537.116s">We</a>  strongly, strongly encourage our caregivers of our younger students to closely monitor any online activity to ensure that children are not being exposed to inappropriate content. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2552.456s">We</a>  also agree with advice from experts that older children with access to the internet should be encouraged to be skeptical of videos shared on social media and offered help with evaluating the news sources that they are using. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2570.908s">We</a>  are here for all of our community, especially those with loved ones and friends facing the atrocities of this war firsthand. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2581.07s">We</a>  strongly condemn the terror attacks perpetuated by Hamas. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2585.591s">Moreover,</a>  we join our community in grief for the lives broken and lost in this last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2594.833s">Amid</a>  these upsetting events, I am reminded of how fortunate and privileged we are to live in a safe and loving community here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2607.457s">I</a>  hope we can all stand together to support our neighbors and community members in this difficult moment.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2619.36s">I'd</a>  like to transition and share some news, important news from the district.</p>

spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2910.906s">As</a>  I will discuss in my presentation, the survey represents a snapshot in time, which I hope we can utilize as a benchmark and a point of comparison against future student-oriented surveys and feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=2928.311s">I</a>  want to say thank you to the members for recommending changes to the

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3226.963s">Member</a>  Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3229.265s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3229.625s">It's</a>  really exciting to see so many students want to be involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3232.227s">And</a>  I think that's that's wonderful both for for us to get input from the students, but you know, for them to get the experience of being involved <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3240.683s">more</a>  directly with democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3243.685s">So</a>  my question really, I have is, you know, there really is a very specific policy and law. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3250.789s">And</a>  I'm wondering how this is going to be hopefully shaped a little bit to more closely fit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3258.513s">The</a>  13 students is, again, it's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3260.894s">I</a>  don't know if you're thinking of having a combination of, you know, the policy calls for five students, and I think <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3267.711s">My</a>  assumption is that's an attempt to make it less unwieldy if you have a lot of students trying to meet with school committee, so that they can have a more direct involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3277.098s">And</a>  I'm wondering if there's a way, or if you're considering a way of trying to, for those meetings, maybe have a subset of students attend?</p>

    <p>[B_or_Ix1ooU_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3286.685s">We</a>  could definitely consider that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3288.447s">I'll</a>  be honest, throughout this work, I've always tried to expand the voice of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3293.834s">And</a>  when I read that law, similar to the school site council law, it's wide latitude for interpretation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3301.117s">And</a>  I interpreted that after consulting other members of this board previously to that, to really be a minimum, like for five to be a minimum number and that to really try to expand the opportunities for student voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3316.321s">High</a>  school students, especially, I will also say the law says nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3319.402s">It</a>  is completely silent on middle school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3322.444s">And</a>  I know for a fact that middle school students have really great ideas and a lot to share. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3327.809s">And</a>  so we've expanded it down to the middle school as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3330.752s">While</a>  those are not required to be part of school committee meetings, I would invite any group, less than four, I think it is, to come and join us at any point to be able to listen and converse and meet with those middle school students because some of the stuff that they've offered has been really tremendous and enlightening over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3350.401s">So</a>  we've interpreted that, or I should say I, in this role, have really interpreted it as more of a minimum than an absolute of five.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3360.127s">So</a>  I guess I would just say, I mean, we had, I think we had a similar discussion about this already, because I know you have these preexisting student advisory councils, and actually it's pretty specific in saying five students in terms of the law and the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3373.514s">And</a>  it's not that I'm stuck on the five students, but I do think that there's a reason for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3377.617s">And</a>  I believe that most likely the reason <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3380.071s">Again,</a>  it's to give students a more direct, if you've got 13 students trying to meet with us, the opportunities for each student to really be involved are going to be less than if you have a smaller number of students directly involved in those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3395.479s">And</a>  so I'd love to see if there's a way you can maybe try to give each student obviously a chance to do that, but maybe have a smaller meetings that there is more opportunity for them to really be directly involved <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3407.355s">in</a>  having a conversation with school committee, whoever's able, I think we'll need to look at, again, coordinating those meetings to figure out if there's gonna be a subset of us who can make it to those meetings or whether it's a whole committee, which would be obviously the ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3424.828s">But</a>  I'm glad to see this is getting started and I really appreciate the work you've put into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3428.471s">And</a>  again, it's exciting to see that there's so many students who really wanna be involved.</p>

    <p>[B_or_Ix1ooU_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3431.674s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3433.882s">Perhaps</a>  we look at elections within the group of students or something along those lines, but I just wanna make sure that when I've looked at other communities too, they've expanded far beyond just 13, and we're hoping to build that over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3449.265s">And</a>  to find a way so that it's not unwieldy, I'm definitely committed to that, but I am also just throughout my time as assistant principal and now, the greatest change has come from the voice of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3463.428s">And</a>  the greatest push oftentimes comes from when you have students on your side advocating that we can really help to move their progress and move a district's progress forward.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3476.031s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3476.491s">And</a>  I think that was the reason why the state put this in place for us to make sure that school districts are doing that and really getting the voice of the students involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3484.332s">So</a>  look forward to getting this going. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3486.993s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3488.753s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3489.414s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3491.843s">Just</a>  a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3494.143s">Is</a>  there a time of day that you are targeting for these meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3499.424s">So</a>  we'll be meeting monthly with the students after school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3501.665s">But</a>  these dates that are on our.</p>

    <p>[B_or_Ix1ooU_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3504.605s">I</a>  leave that up to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3505.625s">I'm</a>  not suggesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3507.466s">These</a>  were the dates that fit based on the conversation last June. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3510.826s">I</a>  went through and these are the dates that fit every other month within. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3516.327s">So</a>  I would defer to the committee as to what time works best.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3521.212s">Is</a>  there a time of day that would work best for students? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3524.334s">I</a>  mean, I think just practically speaking, if it's going to be inside the school day, there's going to be some finagling on our end to get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3533.578s">So</a>  if we could be least disruptive to students, given that we have to do that to our schedules anyway, I think I would be fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3541.721s">I</a>  don't know if there's a good time or a bad time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3544.302s">Yeah,</a>  I don't know enough about the high school schedule to know is there some magical space where <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3550.734s">it's</a>  not pulling them out of classes or what have you.</p>

    <p>[B_or_Ix1ooU_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3553.956s">Would</a>  you prefer immediately after school at 2.30 or would you prefer during the school day? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3561.081s">After</a>  school, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3562.662s">So</a>  my suggestion would then be 2.30 to make sure that we're able to- Aren't these all on Wednesdays?</p>

    <p>[North]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3569.166s">Is</a>  that early release? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3570.086s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[B_or_Ix1ooU_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3570.327s">No,</a>  they're not early release days. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3571.888s">I</a>  avoided those. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3574.87s">Having</a>  tried to have the meetings on early release days, thinking that would be, no, it didn't really work. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3581.508s">So,</a>  you've visited a few of these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3583.649s">So,</a>  which was great.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3587.371s">So,</a>  in terms of the dates proposed, I am fine with all those dates except for the January date. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3593.074s">That's</a>  not a date that I will be able to be there at but all the rest are fine for me and I think we just need to make sure that we post the meeting and they <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3609.461s">if</a>  other members of the community want to join us, they know how to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3613.463s">But</a>  so, if the committee wants to keep that January 17th date, I I'm totally fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3621.526s">I</a>  just I definitely know that I can't be there and I also know that there will be at least three new members of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3628.969s">So,</a>  I don't wanna make promises on behalf of people who can't tell us about their schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3634.591s">So,</a>  that's my other sort of concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3636.051s">I</a>  don't know how we work <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3638.871s">decide</a>  on what the dates are because otherwise, you know, it's going to be really hard to manage the execution of that.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3649.798s">Based</a>  on the students requesting immediately after school, I can work with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3658.323s">Malone</a>  to send out calendar holds for like a 2.30 to 3.30 block of time, maybe a one hour block <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3667.711s">and</a>  then everyone will get it if that's helpful.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3672.895s">Member</a>  Rizzo.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3673.995s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3674.536s">I</a>  just also want to remind us from a security perspective that the high school must be unlocked and open for these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3681.541s">These</a>  are public meetings, just like these. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3683.982s">We</a>  can't have locked doors, so we'll have to plan the security around that, unless we don't have a quorum of members, in which case it's just a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3694.23s">So</a>  that's important to remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3697.089s">When</a>  posting the agenda, if more than three of us show up, none of us are speaking about anything related to policy, unless it's already on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3707.195s">So</a>  I just, my biggest concern about these meetings, which I obviously want to hear from the students, is I don't want each of these meetings to be a series of open meeting law violations, because nobody really wants to deal with those. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3722.044s">So</a>  somebody will have to plan the effort around <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3725.529s">making</a>  our high school open at 230 when there's clubs and all the other stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3731.831s">Because</a>  I assume we're going to have them there, it doesn't make sense to cart the students over here, that doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3738.573s">So</a>  I just want to make sure those logistics are worked out, rather than on the 17th or the 15th of November, when we sit down and we have a quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3748.038s">And</a>  then there's a locked door because that's just not gonna be acceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3754.062s">It's</a>  also against, it's a violation, so.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3757.935s">I'm</a>  willing to reach out to MASC and if we need to post it as a, I don't know, special meeting, student advisory special meeting to be held at the high school, maybe we can use the library or a larger open space.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3777.332s">Sorry,</a>  I mean, if we're speaking at all, then if there's four of us, then it is a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3786.011s">an</a>  official meeting that will have an agenda posted following open meeting law. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3789.672s">If</a>  we all swear to sit silently and listen or nod and be jovial and not engage in a single item of a policy for which we have authority, then I don't think that's a meeting, that's just four or more of us happen to be in the same place.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3803.876s">What's</a>  point of information? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3805.497s">That's</a>  unless it's on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3807.137s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3808.238s">Of</a>  course, yes.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3809.54s">So</a>  if there's items on the agenda, we can speak to those items, which is why I asked if there would be an agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3814.383s">So</a>  we will have an agenda.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3816.664s">An</a>  agenda, though, can be just that we're having a meeting and we're showing up and we're going to listen to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3821.808s">That's</a>  an agenda, an agenda that has items such as we're going to talk about food service or we're going to talk about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3828.852s">Those</a>  are different kinds of agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3830.333s">They're</a>  both agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3832.014s">And</a>  Medford has a long history of showing up to talk about whatever anybody wants to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3837.842s">And</a>  that's not how open meeting law works. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3840.783s">And</a>  I just don't want to be the person sitting there silently because I don't want to violate open meeting law on a topic that I care greatly about. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3847.647s">That's</a>  my biggest beef, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3850.888s">If</a>  other members feel comfortable ignoring that, that's up to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3855.21s">But</a>  I don't want to sit here silently looking like a jerk because I won't say anything on a topic that's not on the agenda for which we have authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3864.375s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3878.133s">No</a>  problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3879.513s">So</a>  I think, to me, there's a couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3883.034s">If</a>  we are going to have an officially posted school committee meeting, there has to be a quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3889.396s">And</a>  so I think we do need to orchestrate whether <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3893.615s">there</a>  are in fact four members of the committee who can be at each of these meetings because if they're not, we can still hold the meetings, but they get held differently and they are not publicly posted meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3906.103s">But</a>  if we post a meeting, there has to be a quorum in order for the meeting to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3910.806s">So</a>  we can't post a meeting and just have three people show up because then we can't have the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3916.43s">So</a>  I think there needs to be a little bit of orchestration around <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3919.676s">who</a>  is coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3921.117s">And</a>  I think that will drive like exactly how the meeting can happen on our end. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3927.441s">But</a>  I think also like if there is a posted meeting, it would be helpful if the students could sort of identify a set of topics that they want to talk to us about so that those can be posted on an agenda if we're having an official meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3942.23s">The</a>  other thing I would suggest is we can hold a Zoom meeting and then there's no requirement for the high school to be unlocked, which creates other safety issues and concerns, but the students could certainly join from a common place to our meeting on Zoom, as long as the meeting is posted to be an exclusively Zoom oriented meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3963.644s">So</a>  I think there are some options there that don't require us to open the high school to be in compliance with the law, the open meeting law, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3973.309s">Because</a>  we are allowed to host meetings on zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3975.55s">And</a>  I think we as a body need to be clear about who is able to join each meeting because that will drop that should drive and set the like rules of engagement around making sure that we can actually have a dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3990.276s">And</a>  that will happen differently based on how many of us are able to join at any given time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3995.558s">So</a>  I think we need to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=3998.208s">you</a>  know, we can certainly talk about the November meeting because all of us here are the folks that have to be available for that November meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4005.171s">Um</a>  but I think we probably just need to have another conversation about those meetings as they come up so that we have the right rules in place for everybody.</p>

    <p>[B_or_Ix1ooU_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4016.196s">And</a>  if I could just interject real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4018.738s">The</a>  the dates are only suggested so we can do the November and then worry about when the new</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4027.321s">Sounds</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4027.721s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, then Member Kreatz.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4031.082s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4032.463s">I</a>  think that this is a great opportunity actually for the student advisory to understand governance and how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4040.945s">And</a>  so I actually would make a motion that they are offered some training by MASC. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4051.612s">a</a>  short training, an hour or so training by MASC just around sort of some of the basics. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4056.035s">So</a>  they're understanding this and then also understanding the agenda items. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4059.277s">So,</a>  you know, to member Rousseau's point and to other folks' point, when they come to these public meetings, they don't understand why they can't talk about something that's on, that's not on the agenda, that can be really frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4073.527s">So</a>  for the students to be able to really understand <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4076.528s">why</a>  it needs to be on the agenda and sort of just a basic primer, I would love for them to have some opportunity to be trained instead of just being sort of thrown into this role. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4085.312s">So</a>  I'm making a motion that we ask MASC Dorothy to provide a one-hour training to our student advisory body so that they understand.</p>

    <p>[B_or_Ix1ooU_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4094.276s">I</a>  was just writing down Dorothy Presser's name prior to, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4098.478s">What</a>  did you say?</p>

    <p>[B_or_Ix1ooU_SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4099.319s">I</a>  was just writing down Dorothy Presser's name called Dorothy.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4102.1s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4102.84s">So</a>  I just need a second.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4106.794s">The</a>  administration will look into an MASC training for our student advisory students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4114.997s">Motion</a>  by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4117.698s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4118.458s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4119.638s">All</a>  those opposed?</p>

    <p>[63m6ohF-DtU_SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4121.279s">Motion</a>  is passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4122.619s">Member</a>  Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4123.819s">Yes,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4125.38s">I</a>  was just going to say I can't make the November 15th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4129.821s">I</a>  have an appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4131.502s">I</a>  just wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4132.54s">That's</a>  not a good date for me, but that's, you know, if there's a quorum and everybody can be there, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4137.541s">It'll</a>  be unfortunate, and it sounds like a wonderful experience, and I really like the idea of the MAAC training with Dorothy, because it's useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4145.663s">It</a>  was really helpful for us, and you'll learn a lot, and a lot of takeaways from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4152.024s">And</a>  thank you for putting this together.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4156.746s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4157.306s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4157.586s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4160.516s">We</a>  have number three report on superintendents goals for school year 2023 2024 and update on the status of the metric school committee goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4170.144s">Dr.</a>  Marice Edouard-Vincent superintendent, this was previously tabled from 10 to 2023.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4174.308s">I'm</a>  not sure if Dr. Cushing you're able to share it, if that's a possibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4184.557s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4187.666s">So</a>  these are draft goals for school year 23-24. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4194.512s">And</a>  the first goal is our district improvement goal.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4205.123s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4210.851s">The</a>  district improvement goal for the draft goal, again, I'm waiting for additional feedback from the committee, is that during the school year 23-24, the Medford Public Schools will improve systems and structures that directly impact student services, student and family and communications, and school facilities and operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4235.572s">Our</a>  goals are to continue to maintain a learning environment built upon the pillars of safety, equity and consistency, creating a culture that values consistent communication and safe and accessible school facilities for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4251.676s">So</a>  there were six key actions that were proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4257.037s">And</a>  the first key action was again, improving physical accessibility at school facilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4263.084s">and</a>  developing a maintenance ticket system. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4267.047s">That</a>  was recommended by the committee as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4270.11s">Consistent</a>  communication to families across all schools, including student services such as athletics, counseling, career services, and student governance. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4283.2s">Three,</a>  effective and appropriate and consistent messaging during any emergency scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4292.327s">for</a>  reestablish the capital planning committee to examine building systems in creating a replacement timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4302.785s">Five,</a>  seizing every opportunity to collaborate with MSBA to improve facilities and building systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4311.31s">And</a>  we do have another meeting scheduled this week on October 19th with MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4318.015s">Again,</a>  informational meetings for all districts that have applied to MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4323.858s">And</a>  number six, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4327.981s">Enhancing</a>  our human resource practices, such as job postings hiring and payroll management. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4336.124s">And</a>  so some of the proposed outcomes would be increasing accessibility and parking pedestrian restroom facilities communication platforms, such as some more and final site. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4351.071s">Our</a>  mass notification systems that are going to be used regularly and consistently by all schools and student servicing groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4359.718s">We</a>  would like to have well documented model communications and templates that are going to be utilized by all school administrators. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4371.414s">and</a>  officials so that, again, things are standardized and streamlined for any kind of emergency communication scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4384.317s">A</a>  capital planning committee, reviews of every single school would be one of our outcomes and streamlined and more effective job postings and onboarding procedures <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4397.32s">for</a>  our staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4398.741s">So</a>  these were the draft recommended district improvement goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4405.686s">I</a>  want to just move to our student learning goals, which are, we continue to use literacy as our student learning goal, an area that we really want to focus in on and continue to develop greater strategies and strengths. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4426.9s">So</a>  again, our student learning goal would be to assess literacy skills and implementing interventions in literacy to improve outcomes by deepening teacher and principal knowledge of literacy practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4443.938s">while</a>  maintaining a district wide focus on instruction and assessment through the continued use of our in-house system NWEA map dibbles, and our newly adopted literacy program into reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4461.926s">And</a>  so the goal is similar to last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4464.788s">However,</a>  we have catered it to really be specific to where we are at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4471.971s">So</a>  we have six key actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4474.933s">Again,</a>  many of them were repeated from last year, but the work continues. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4479.975s">So</a>  this is kind of now that we've officially selected our literacy program into reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4488.771s">We</a>  want to do all of the things possible to continue to make sure that that programming and the significant financial investment really has the opportunity to get really strong traction within the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4502.437s">So</a>  we will continue as a district to follow DESE's, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education's dyslexia guidance, which we've been doing for multiple years. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4515.763s">So</a>  we're using inter-reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4517.384s">We're</a>  also doing ECRI, which stands for Enhanced Core Reading Instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4522.785s">And</a>  we're using DIBLS, which I mentioned earlier, but it stands for the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4530.948s">And</a>  those assessments are used, DIBLS is used with our youngest learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4537.089s">Again,</a>  tier one ELA blocks in all grades for kindergarten to grade two. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4543.411s">district</a>  wide, and we have a continued partnership with Hill for Literacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4548.914s">During</a>  the 23-24 school year, there is embedded professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4554.596s">Last</a>  week I had the opportunity to participate in professional development with the Missittuck School, third grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4562.54s">And</a>  so coaching is being provided that's going to really support instruction and help teachers to look <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4571.324s">at</a>  their specific literacy data. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4575.666s">We</a>  will continue to use NWEA map again as our district in-house district assessment so that we can have baseline beginning of year data, middle of year data, and then end of year data. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4589.794s">So</a>  we can monitor our own progress and growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4593.956s">And</a>  we will continue to work with our elementary district literacy leadership team, the DLLT. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4600.58s">So</a>  there's a lot of work happening in literacy it's critical work right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4605.662s">And</a>  we are beginning to see really positive payoff outcomes from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4613.539s">So</a>  we list some of the outcomes, scope and sequence for grades K to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4620.264s">Medford</a>  Public Schools is establishing data cycles that are going to be measuring our performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4627.029s">Again,</a>  this is a new area that we are really formally entering, working with partners and collaborators. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4639.978s">And</a>  one of our outcomes where we're saying visible implementation of the science of reading the best practices that are taking place during our literacy blocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4649.25s">We</a>  have that listed as an outcome because again we've made a significant investment with every hill for literacy, and now with into reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4658.682s">And</a>  so the expectation is that this is what is being used every day in all of our classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4665.246s">So</a>  accountability measures, we would like to see under NWEA map, 65% of our students in grades two through 10 to meet or exceed their projected growth targets on the NWEA map assessments. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4683.993s">We</a>  would like to see for dibbles 90% of our elementary students, that they will make at least 10% growth in oral reading fluency. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4695.16s">And</a>  that's words read correctly by June of 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4700.444s">And</a>  for professional development, Medford public schools will continue to provide targeted <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4707.288s">targeted</a>  professional development for our elementary staff with inter-reading training every month during the 23-24 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4719.054s">My</a>  final goal is the professional practice goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4723.296s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4725.197s">And</a>  that is to engage. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4728.499s">I</a>  am continuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4729.9s">No,</a>  Dr. Cushing, I'm actually using the screen share. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4732.881s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4734.122s">I</a>  am <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4737.475s">part</a>  of the superintendent, the BIPOC Superintendent Support Network of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4743.88s">And</a>  I still am participating with Leading Now, which is a national superintendent network. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4751.986s">And</a>  so participating in these two particular networks are providing me with a lot of current information to be able to continue to do this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4764.856s">In</a>  modern day times, we support one another, we work with one another, we look at race equity diversity and inclusion in education. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4777.784s">We,</a>  I attend monthly sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4781.306s">Earlier</a>  today, I was part of the superintendent support network, where ma SS. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4788.01s">Mr.</a>  Tom Scott and Mary Bork, they participate as well in the first half of those professional development sessions, and we tack it tackle current problems of practice that Massachusetts is facing, or. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4804.455s">challenges</a>  that are happening across the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4807.236s">And</a>  so that is the work that I'm doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4809.637s">The</a>  key expected outcomes, again, are to leverage the expertise and collective knowledge of other colleagues in the state of Massachusetts and nationally, continuing to lead and learn about the impacts and the importance of REDI in education, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4829.27s">and</a>  participating in continued collaboration with Middlesex County DA, Marion Ryan's office, who presents current problems of practice and challenges that Middlesex County is facing, not only in Medford, but again, across the county to be able to better support our students here in Medford and the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4854.06s">So</a>  those are my proposed goals, and I await your feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4859.142s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4859.622s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4860.943s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4861.983s">Yep,</a>  just a matter of procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4863.303s">I</a>  believe we need to make a motion to take this off the table, so I'm motioning to take it off the table for since it was tabled on 10-2 before we start to speak.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4876.607s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4877.907s">By</a>  Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4879.688s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4880.668s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4881.028s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4881.428s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4882.769s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4885.249s">So</a>  taking this off the table, there any comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4888.635s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, do you have any comments? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4889.736s">What</a>  was that? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4893.539s">Member</a>  Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4894.52s">Member</a>  Hays and Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4897.563s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4897.863s">So</a>  I, hopefully you received it, Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4901.767s">I</a>  sent you an email a little over a week ago, just with a couple of my comments and feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4908.072s">And</a>  so one question I had from you is looking at the communication goals <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4914.55s">I</a>  had requested that you look to add a goal that is more focused, again, we've talked about this, I think, in the past, on two-way communication, that again, the current goals are really focused on the district giving information to families, caregivers, students, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4935.133s">in</a>  looking again for a goal that may or an outcome, I guess, that would be more specifically focused on that two way communication and in my email to you, I talked about, you know, if you could commit to a number of events, such as monthly coffee hours or attendance at PTO meetings, that two way communication being that you put <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4958.168s">you're</a>  having an event or in a way for parents to actually talk back to you and talk to you about their concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4965.493s">It</a>  could be that you focus it on a specific topic, or it could just be kind of an open, again, like a coffee hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4973.019s">Some</a>  of that, I think, like last year, you did have a wonderful budget meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4978.563s">It</a>  wasn't, unfortunately, it wasn't as well attended as I'd hoped, but it was really well designed in terms of having the interpretation for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4988.24s">So</a>  things like that, if you could commit to maybe putting that in one of your goals is a more specific way of getting at that two-way communication.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=4997.666s">I</a>  can definitely add under outcomes increased two-way communication over the course of the year, because there are some events that take place at schools <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5011.603s">Depending</a>  on what is happening where I may be able to go and attend as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5017.466s">I,</a>  and I appreciate you sending this to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5021.907s">I</a>  just was waiting for you to share it with the entire committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5026.429s">So,</a>  I think it can be a combination. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5031.179s">of</a>  either coffee hour, or the PTO meeting some some take place virtually, or other types of parent engagement events. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5046.934s">So</a>  I am open to that, and I can have that added as increased under outcomes, increased two-way communication opportunities with families, including coffee hours or special events at schools.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5065.884s">So</a>  I guess I'm hoping what I'd like to see really is a really specific commitment to a minimum number of events that you would attend or create <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5076.26s">just</a>  so we really have something very concrete for when it comes time for the evaluation.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5081.944s">So</a>  do you want the entire goal to change?</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5084.566s">I</a>  was looking more at the outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5086.928s">It</a>  doesn't really have to change the goal itself, but one of the outcomes for communication would be, we'll attend a minimum of five events <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5101.215s">or</a>  have a minimum of five coffee hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5103.256s">I</a>  kind of let that open for you, what you feel most comfortable doing, whether you wanted to have it be more directed as in terms of being like a focus group that you want to focus on a topic or whether you want to leave it towards a more open ended kind of event where you have coffee hours and you can just chat with parents and they can bring whatever concerns they want to you.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5125.603s">So</a>  what I'm writing right now is increased two-way communication, increased two-way communication with families, with a minimum of five events over the course of the school year.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5144.775s">Sounds</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5150.699s">And</a>  I did have one other piece, but I know others have their hands raised, so I can come back.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5156.84s">If</a>  it's just one more, you can go member Hays, then member Graham, then member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5164.026s">And</a>  then member Rizzo.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5165.767s">The</a>  other thing that I had asked of you was looking at the accountability, accountability under the literacy law. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5180.4s">So</a>  I was a little unclear for the NWEA map when you say 65% students, grades two to 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5188.603s">Is</a>  that an aggregate of all of them? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5190.804s">Because</a>  I would love to see that more specific that, you know, we know that we have differences among schools in terms of how they perform. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5199.969s">So</a>  an aggregate really doesn't give us a complete picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5204.473s">across</a>  the schools, because we do have some that perform much higher and some that perform much lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5209.077s">So</a>  when you get the aggregate, either end gets a little bit, the information just isn't as clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5216.003s">So</a>  I was, my request has been for both of those two, the DIBELS and the NWEA map that you just had in the phrase at each school.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5228.143s">I,</a>  I think where my, my caution was just where some of the schools do have different programs, and we do have some different demographics. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5242.03s">Our</a>  goal is definitely to see growth for all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5247.773s">I</a>  was not sure if it would end up. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5253.397s">potentially</a>  showing the data that maybe one school may outperform other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5261.965s">But</a>  we want to see progress and growth at every single school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5265.548s">So</a>  I was trying to see if we could just combine everyone and see how are we moving as an entire district because we are looking <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5274.878s">at</a>  our data. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5277.64s">We</a>  do disaggregate it and look at it through other lenses as well.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5282.964s">I'm</a>  just not sure if... That doesn't give us the ability to see whether individual schools are making progress, because it is true that sometimes one school outperforms another, and I think that's information that we need to have as a school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5297.734s">when</a>  we're making decisions and budgeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5300.434s">And</a>  it also is information that the community needs to be able to clearly see because that should drive some of our decisions if there's differences in the scores among the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5310.196s">I</a>  think that's important information to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5311.996s">I</a>  also think that now that we also have our new executive director of data, hopefully that position, the person in that position could help to explain. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5320.958s">Certainly</a>  there's always should be explanation of the reasons behind the differences <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5326.843s">in</a>  the scores, but I think that's information that we really need to have because an aggregate score doesn't always completely give us the full picture of whether the students are making progress.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5342.327s">I</a>  would just, if that's the will of the committee, I just would want us to be sure that we have a disclaimer knowing that some schools have different populations. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5354.029s">So</a>  students are maybe acquiring English at different rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5359.99s">And</a>  so they may not perform as well as some of the other schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5366.531s">And</a>  just that that's taken into consideration, that they are making progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5370.796s">but</a>  they're just making progress at a different rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5373.697s">And</a>  some of our, so that was where there was reservation on my part, but, you know, that is a possibility.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5384.08s">So</a>  I just want everyone to be aware of that, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5392.083s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5392.543s">That</a>  was for that, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5395.244s">Member</a>  Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5397.949s">I</a>  have a bunch of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5399.911s">So,</a>  I'm going to apologize in advance that I did not get an email to the superintendent before today but I'm happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5407.857s">Um</a>  if um if she would like afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5411.28s">Um</a>  to member Hays's point like I'm I am supportive of expecting to or being able to see how various schools are performing and of course like <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5423.402s">we</a>  understand that there are different programs in different places, we get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5428.084s">But</a>  I think if we're talking about growth, like we would wanna be seeing growth among all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5435.566s">And</a>  I think the other thing I would like to see is a much more like cohesive visual of how we did against the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5449.695s">The</a>  goal because last year it was really difficult and I think if I can recall like I don't think we made I don't think we hit the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5460.238s">Or</a>  we hit it in some places and not in others, and it was incredibly difficult as somebody who is like sitting down to say, did you meet expectations, yes or no. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5471.434s">Whether</a>  you did or you didn't and I part of it was because like we've got this just big pile of information and there wasn't an agreed upon like way that we will see this information in some sort of like one page summary form that says like. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5488.424s">We</a>  did it or we didn't by these measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5490.825s">And</a>  so I think it would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5494.106s">Well,</a>  before we are talking about the evaluation to come up with what that like dashboard looks like for lack of a better term so that we can all say, yeah, we agree that this point of view of the data is going to give us what we need to be able to like understand like <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5510.799s">Where</a>  did we meet this goal, this literacy goal? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5513.76s">Where</a>  did we not? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5515.12s">And</a>  did we in the aggregate, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5516.981s">Because</a>  I think that's always the hard part. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5518.722s">It's</a>  like, well, you did and you did here, you didn't there, you did here, you did here, you didn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5523.503s">And</a>  like, what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5525.384s">So</a>  I think it would be helpful for us to agree on that upfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5529.025s">So</a>  that would be the design of that would certainly be an outcome that I think would be very, very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5536.357s">Also</a>  from a literacy perspective, I guess, you know, one question that I had is like, I don't feel like we talked about dibbles last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5543.301s">I</a>  could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5545.062s">Um,</a>  but if we're saying we want 90% of students to make a 10%, um, jump, what, what did they do last year? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5552.946s">Did</a>  we like, is that, do we already do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5556.228s">And</a>  we should be like pushing you to do something more than 10%. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5560.791s">Like</a>  what, so what is the baseline? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5562.752s">Like,</a>  where are we starting? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5563.913s">It's</a>  hard to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5565.08s">This</a>  is a good sort of aggressive but realistic goal without knowing like where are we right now from a DIBLS perspective.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5581.986s">I</a>  don't have the growth for oral reading fluency for last year's data at hand right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5591.349s">So</a>  I can definitely work on getting that data to you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5601.752s">And</a>  I think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5602.993s">I'm</a>  sort of envisioning there's like a revision of this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5605.874s">So</a>  I think that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5607.854s">So</a>  I just, I more wanna know like, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5610.799s">We,</a>  I want you to have goals that are attainable but also like are pushing the district forward and if we're like if we're already at 90 90% 90% of students meeting 10% like that's not a push that's not a goal that's going to push us forward right if we're already if that's sort of what we have been doing all this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5631.801s">don't</a>  think you don't need to have the answer right now but I think that's the information like I would need to feel comfortable that that is a goal where we're saying we're really pushing the the needle forward here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5642.347s">So,</a>  from a from a student learning goal, those, that was all my comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5647.21s">I</a>  actually had quite a number of thoughts about the district improvement goal as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5651.953s">So,</a>  I don't know, mayor, if you want me to go through them.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5656.275s">One</a>  more of your questions and then we'll. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5657.956s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5658.257s">Move</a>  on to</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5662.107s">There's</a>  a series of things that I think are missing from this goal, either as an action or an outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5669.378s">and</a>  I'll try to run through them and I promise to send you an email as well, but I would like to see a commitment to a timely budget process that's thoughtful, comprehensive, and timely because we struggle with that every single year no matter what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5683.804s">We</a>  passed a resolution a few weeks ago about an excessive heat protocol, so I would like to see that be listed as <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5691.952s">a</a>  key action that the development of that protocol is completed and implemented and that we could see it in action if there were another excessive heat day. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5702.621s">We</a>  also are in the middle of looking at new schedules for the middle school or revised schedules for the middle school and the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5710.507s">So</a>  I would like to be able to see that we're ready to implement those things at the start of the next school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5715.711s">I</a>  would also like to see evidence that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5722.46s">implemented</a>  the the bullying policy that we just passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5727.123s">Um</a>  because I think that policy implementation is a concern that I have just in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5732.767s">Um</a>  but that was a really big important change. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5736.729s">Um</a>  and I wanna I I don't have a thought off the top of my head about like how would we know it's being implemented but I think that's the question for you to <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5750.666s">And</a>  then I just have a couple more things I can like move quickly because I'm going to send you an email if that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5757.468s">I</a>  would also like to see there be a specific outcome that ties to the climate study that we're going to talk about in just a minute, where we are, you know, we started talking about that last time and we talked about the data there as a baseline. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5771.272s">So</a>  it's like a starting point. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5774.093s">And</a>  if that's a starting point, we should be able to see and observe <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5779.072s">measurable</a>  progress based on that survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5781.694s">If</a>  we are doing the work to improve the climate and culture so I think tying to some advancement of the of that survey however you know again I don't have a specific idea of how we do it but I would love to hear what. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5794.807s">your</a>  team thinks about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5798.109s">I</a>  would like to see something explicit that ties us to like a percentage of improvement in that survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5804.332s">And</a>  then two other things that are sort of on my mind, we've sort of danced around the idea that the strategic plan is expiring or done or sort of at the end of its term. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5817.245s">And</a>  I would like for us to at least this year have a plan for how we're gonna go forward with the strategic plan that makes the plan about engagement of lots of audiences, which did not happen last time, and is really sort of the hallmark of a strategic plan to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5837.83s">So</a>  I would like to see something about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5841.07s">And</a>  then the last thing that I will say, and then I will stop talking, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5844.497s">is</a>  under number six where we talk about enhancing human resources practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5848.498s">I</a>  think that's really critically important. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5851.559s">I</a>  would like to add and labor relations to this bullet number six under key actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5857.781s">I</a>  am really, really concerned about the climate that we find ourselves in from a labor relations perspective with our bargaining partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5869.693s">and</a>  I would like to see us really intentionally chart a better path forward where we're operating with clarity and collaboration and just an overall feeling of teamwork and that from an HR perspective, we have good controls and procedures in place when it comes to labor relations issues and they will always happen no matter how well-functioning a district, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5894.734s">And</a>  then I think from an outcomes perspective, I would like to see us, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5899.113s">complete</a>  and execute and implement an employee handbook and I know we've talked about that and I think there's a draft floating around but I think it is well past time for us to have an employee handbook that outlines the rules of the road for everybody who is in our employ. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5915.206s">Okay,</a>  that's my whole list. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5916.327s">I</a>  will send you an email with all of those things on them but those are all things that I think would add some like real meat to this and and be relevant to like what we have in front of us as a district right now.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5930.401s">Thank</a>  you, Member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5933.522s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5935.183s">I</a>  would agree with my colleagues just in terms of measurable goals and benchmarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5940.104s">And</a>  I think that, again, knowing where we're starting and what the measure is for where we're going is really critical for us to be able to do an appropriate evaluation when the time comes to be able to say, yes, this goal was achieved and we started here and we're now here in terms of data. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5955.189s">So</a>  I would definitely agree with the measurable goals and benchmarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5960.948s">And</a>  specifically, thank you for taking some time to rethink that this and also to just listen to our feedback tonight to and reconsider some of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5972.153s">I</a>  think that, you know, it's really important to have that back and forth and continue to work together to ensure that we're able to <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5980.797s">adequately</a>  evaluate and look at what's being done in terms of both the district and performance in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5989.261s">Specifically</a>  for, I'm looking at, you know, as we look at safety, equity and consistency and safe and accessible are things that have been used a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=5999.505s">For</a>  item number one, I'm just curious about the improved physical accessibilities at school facilities and develop maintenance systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6007.028s">I'm</a>  curious about, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6009.375s">why</a>  physical there and not improve accessibility at school facilities? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6014.398s">Like</a>  what was the differentiation for you in terms of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6018.5s">And</a>  then I'll just, I have a response about one of the outcomes on that.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6022.922s">I</a>  definitely can remove the word physical and just have it say increase accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6029.966s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6030.326s">I</a>  just didn't know if there was clarity. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6031.807s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6031.987s">I</a>  just didn't know if there was a particular reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6033.888s">So</a>  thank you for clarifying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6035.461s">And</a>  then for the outcomes, I would ask, you know, so the increasing accessibility of, you know, access, parking, pedestrian, restroom facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6043.947s">So</a>  it's, I don't think it's just facilities in terms of, you know, some of the specifics, which at the same time, I know that we need to have these benchmarks and objectives, but I would also ask that you consider, you know, I think pedestrian covers entrances and exits, but also signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6061.741s">So</a>  one of the biggest issues for a lot of the students are not knowing where to go in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6067.143s">And</a>  so I think, again, accessibility around the signage and what that looks like and how people know where they're going. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6072.485s">And</a>  some of that would be really helpful and be very, you know, much clearer, I think, as we're looking at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6079.368s">And</a>  then the, I would also concur regarding the employee handbook. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6084.55s">I</a>  think that that's really important as we're looking at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6088.231s">And</a>  I think that just thinking about the accessibility <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6090.985s">aspect</a>  of that in all of these ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6092.906s">So</a>  as we were talking earlier and folks were talking about the open house for the eighth graders, I was reminded of last year's open house at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6103.594s">And</a>  I was remembering that there was not any sort of specific accessibility for families who might be a little bit outside of the box, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6114.601s">And</a>  so as we're looking at all of these things, I would ask that we're thinking about how are we making things accessible overall? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6120.646s">And</a>  so I heard member Graham, you know, speak to some of that around, I think some of the language stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6125.59s">And</a>  I'm also thinking around, again, the physical, but also the, you know, some of the sensory, some of the just accessibility overall, like what are we saying when we're having an open house, but we're really not opening it to all of the population if we're not making it accessible in some ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6144.963s">And</a>  I know that within reason there's budgetary issues, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6147.52s">But</a>  will there be any option for either translation or interpretation of materials? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6155.426s">Is</a>  it needed to have an ASL interpreter? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6158.489s">Maybe</a>  it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6159.91s">If</a>  there's going to be any opportunity where it's going to be videoed or shown, are we going to make sure that we're having closed caption? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6167.976s">So</a>  I think just as we're thinking about all of these that we're putting accessible, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6173.444s">in</a>  the language for everything and thinking about how we're doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6175.886s">And</a>  so what does that look like for an outcome? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6178.308s">I</a>  think it's just, you know, when you're talking about well-documented model of communication and templates, I think you guys showed a really great example with the website and being able to show the interpretation, I mean, the translation, but being able to think about what that outreach is to make sure people know that that exists and how do they use it, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6195.622s">So</a>  I think drilling down a little bit into how we can hold <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6200.856s">an</a>  evaluation around whether that work has been done or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6203.277s">So</a>  with specific examples around that, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6205.757s">And</a>  then any of our events that are coming up, like I know we have some great events coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6209.259s">We</a>  have homecoming dance, right, this Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6212.179s">And</a>  have, you know, have people then offer the opportunity to have accommodations if needed for the homecoming dance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6221.262s">And</a>  if so, what does that look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6222.903s">And</a>  being able to understand, you know, how that happens.</p>

    <p>[North]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6227.144s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6231.112s">Member</a>  Ruseau, then Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6233.653s">Oh,</a>  anybody else?</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6234.993s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6237.213s">In</a>  the district improvement goal, everybody else has already asked a bunch of great questions already, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6245.175s">Key</a>  action number four, it's reestablish the capital planning committee to examine building systems and create a replacement timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6253.837s">Create</a>  a replacement timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6255.097s">Does</a>  that mean for each building? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6257.993s">or</a>  I'm not sure what the replacement timeline is, what does that mean?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6263.597s">So</a>  for some pieces of equipment that might be near their end of life.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6269.201s">Okay,</a>  so the individual systems.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6271.463s">Yes,</a>  systems.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6273.004s">So</a>  I can... It is what it says, but I just wanted to be clear because we are also talking about the high school and I didn't want it to seem like this group would be discussing a timeline for replacing the high school, which would be sort of out of scope <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6287.617s">my</a>  thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6288.937s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6289.757s">And</a>  then in outcomes, there is the communication platforms will be used regularly by all systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6299.399s">And</a>  what do you, what does student servicing groups mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6302.84s">I</a>  just wanna make sure, does it mean PTOs? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6304.88s">Does</a>  it mean the clubs? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6306.521s">Does</a>  it, what does student servicing groups mean?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6308.821s">So</a>  we do, we do have, we don't have students right now using some more, but <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6319.016s">We</a>  have principals, we have some administrators that are using this some more and the final site. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6327.76s">So</a>  anything that would be communicating outwards from the district perspective, we would be having it all looped in to some more and final site. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6336.484s">But</a>  if the student servicing groups is just needs to be wordsmith, I can take that off and just say, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6343.254s">communication</a>  platforms, such as some more and final site mass notifications are used regularly by all schools.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6349.297s">I</a>  think that is easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6350.677s">I</a>  just don't want it to sound like we're expecting, you know, the clubs and the packs and other folks to be using this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6357.821s">I</a>  mean, it might be an interesting conversation about whether they should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6361.883s">But</a>  from a scope perspective, I just wanted to make sure that was clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6365.376s">And</a>  then I just had a couple of other questions that are sort of seem random. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6369.78s">But</a>  when we talk about how many more hours a day we expect you to work as an actual employee, how many emails do you receive per day on average? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6378.167s">Just</a>  a guess.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6381.49s">I</a>  couldn't tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6382.931s">Yeah,</a>  definitely. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6384.492s">I</a>  mean, that's only on the, I'm not even looking sometimes at the other email. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6388.936s">So</a>  100 is fair.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6391.582s">And</a>  how many, on average, how many hours a day do you work during the school year?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6398.491s">Oh,</a>  my days are long. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6400.253s">I</a>  actually am a night owl, so I stay late and I continue to work at home.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6407.933s">different</a>  people have different ideas of what it means to work long hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6411.336s">If</a>  I have a 10 hour day, I sometimes I'm like, this day won't end.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6415.058s">But</a>  for other people, I mean, 16 hours, 11 o'clock, and I'll time them to go out at in the morning, like 630. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6423.945s">So</a>  I usually don't go down until close to midnight on average.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6428.788s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6430.469s">Do</a>  you lose vacation days each year that you're allotted in your contract, but you can't actually figure out how to take because you're so busy?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6437.955s">I</a>  have and so have members of the team.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6440.036s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6441.657s">I</a>  just, I think these are important considerations when we consider adding work to you, because I was part of the committee that hired you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6452.22s">And,</a>  you know, there are many different views on what we people expect from a chief executive some people expect a chief executive to be shackled to their job, and not sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6465.52s">frankly,</a>  a lot of chief executives do that, and they're proud of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6470.586s">And</a>  Medford had a history of a superintendent who worked 12, 16 hour days, six days a week, and that worked for Medford at the time and for that superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6481.735s">But</a>  when we were hiring, we were very clear, I was very clear and I think the room was clear, that we were looking for somebody who had some concept of work-life balance and was actually going to be a person who could have a life outside of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6498.485s">And</a>  so when I hear about you can't take the vacation that you're allotted in your contract and you don't get paid for it either, it just vanishes and you, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6509.955s">are</a>  working, you know, I mean, there's the whole, you know, working smarter, not harder, all that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6515.379s">But</a>  there are limits to working smarter and not harder. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6518.802s">When</a>  your boss, which is us, piles more stuff on that we expect only you to do, not to delegate, but only you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6529.07s">You</a>  know, it's quite reasonable in my mind for us to keep piling work on and for you to delegate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6535.836s">But</a>  if we pile work on and we say, it is only, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6539.278s">Dr.</a>  Marice Edouard-Vincent who may perform these duties, then I think it's reasonable for us to consider whether or not we're being in, you know, excessive. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6553.054s">And</a>  so when we talk about, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6556.557s">I</a>  went to many PTO meetings, not many, some PTO meetings when my kids were in elementary school, the principal was always there and I thought that worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6564.821s">And</a>  I mean, has anybody asked principals if they want the superintendent sitting in on their meetings? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6570.283s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6570.723s">And</a>  I don't mean this to be anything about any specific thing tonight, but I do think that, you know, we want you here at eight o'clock in the morning and we want you here at 10 o'clock at night or nine o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6585.516s">And</a>  I just think we need to think about what we're expecting and asking of one human being. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6593.018s">And,</a>  you know, we don't put it everywhere in our policies, but we often say the superintendent will do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6604.204s">And</a>  we decided a while ago that we wouldn't every single time say, or his or her delegate, because that becomes obnoxious to see that written everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6614.351s">But</a>  when we are asking the superintendent to do something, most of the time, I mean, I'm expecting the superintendent to delegate that stuff, not to figure out how to find more hours in a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6627.22s">And</a>  so whenever we ask for things, we're explicitly saying the superintendent is the person that must do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6632.844s">I</a>  think we need to like, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6634.875s">get</a>  out a piece of paper and start figuring out how much are we asking only the superintendent to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6641.678s">It</a>  just concerns me greatly, because there is no time when I can't talk to you, or, and you know, you'll call me or something about like some agenda item, and you're not at home working from home you're still at the office and it's long past rush hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6661.618s">I</a>  just have a lot of concern about what this looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6665.9s">And</a>  someday if we have to hire another superintendent, they're gonna look and say, well, would you last superintendent have to, I don't want a 93 hour a week work, because guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6677.244s">The</a>  salary sounds great to folks who see the contract, but then when you start dividing it up by the number of hours, it starts to not look so good. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6686.307s">So</a>  I'm just deeply concerned about how many goals we are having. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6691.559s">if</a>  we expect those goals to be met exclusively by you personally rather than your ability to delegate them. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6698.181s">And</a>  that just sort of a statement about concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6701.482s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6703.742s">Thank</a>  you, Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6705.383s">Member</a>  Hays and then Member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6710.204s">I</a>  just would like to briefly respond since it was my particular goal area that was commented on. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6717.904s">I</a>  do think that it's important for the superintendent herself to have two-way communication with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6722.888s">I</a>  have also had conversations with her in the past about understanding that this may mean a trade-off with other beyond school activities that she has done in the past, attending football games, attending other sporting events. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6740.261s">I</a>  absolutely do agree that when we add something <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6746.471s">she</a>  needs to take something else away. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6748.972s">And</a>  I also deliberately left, especially when I emailed her, left that kind of open-ended in terms of how she wanted to, how you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, would like to define that two-way communication so that you can make that fit into your schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6766.795s">And</a>  again, with the understanding that you may need to alter other things or change other, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6774.495s">school</a>  events that you would normally attend in order to make those two-way communication events happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6780.196s">So,</a>  just wanted to clarify that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6784.057s">Thank</a>  you, member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6787.518s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6788.158s">So,</a>  I I agree that we need to be thoughtful about when we're asking for something that only the superintendent can do but I would also say that by and large, everything listed here is not something that I would <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6804.414s">be</a>  expecting the superintendent having to personally do the vast majority of everything I talked about I think everything I talked about tonight but also everything that's on here is really a reflection of the work of the district and this is, you know, the superintendent is the <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6818.55s">leader</a>  of the district and so therefore, like sort of the district's goals have to to flow down. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6823.154s">I</a>  would also point out that she has a rather large team of administrators underneath her. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6830.52s">We</a>  hear lots of criticism actually about how large that team is in the community and I'm absolutely okay with the size of the of the support team both of the assistant superintendents and of all of our department directors and our <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6847.33s">our</a>  our coordinators because we have a lot of work to do as a district that has not been done for a really long time and I do think, you know, that's just the reality that we have to operate in but it's, you know, it's it is not good enough to just say, well, we're behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6866.836s">So,</a>  we're going to stay behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6868.896s">We</a>  have to find some, we have to find ways <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6876.172s">you</a>  know, growing set of challenges because our students deserve a district that isn't behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6883.915s">And</a>  that is a huge tall order, but I'm glad that the superintendent has the team that she has between the assistant superintendents and the department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6895.2s">There's</a>  a lot of people working tirelessly. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6897.361s">And</a>  I think, you know, one of the hallmarks of a good leader from my perspective is that <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6903.143s">they</a>  know how to delegate and support their team. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6906.045s">So</a>  I'm hopeful that even though this is an ambitious set of goals that the superintendent, you know, really sits and plans thoughtfully with her team to delegate and make sure that everybody is working in lockstep with what these goals really are so that it can it can provide a sort of some fast forwarding of things that have been really slow to evolve here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6934.328s">and</a>  that we can implement them with some consistency and fidelity.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6939.369s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6943.55s">Thank</a>  you, everybody.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6944.791s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6947.751s">We</a>  have a number four report on MHS culture and climate survey from school year 2022-2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6953.953s">Dr.</a>  Maurice Edward-Vincent, superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6956.573s">This</a>  also was previously tabled from 10 to 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6963.721s">Motion</a>  to take it off the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6964.922s">Motion</a>  to take it off the table by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6970.91s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6971.631s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6972.652s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6973.573s">Motion</a>  is approved.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6983.379s">We</a>  have a slide deck that we're going to share with you.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6986.562s">The</a>  committee received a packet, and the packet gives a more detailed breakout. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=6997.634s">But</a>  for the purposes of this presentation, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7001.898s">I</a>  would like to go through this slide deck and present the key highlights from the Culture and Climate Survey that took place last year at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7019.721s">The</a>  survey questions were developed last year by Medford Public Schools and the Medford Department of Health <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7030.703s">It</a>  was open to all of our high school students between May 18 and June 6 of this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7038.266s">736</a>  students participated in the survey, just over 60% of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7041.748s">At</a>  that time, we had 1,222 students enrolled. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7052.392s">Students</a>  were given designated times during their English classes to complete the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7059.136s">The</a>  survey was also translated into five languages so that students who were English learners had the opportunity to participate in the survey in their native language. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7073.866s">And</a>  just I want to share that the results of this culture and climate survey are truly a snapshot. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7080.671s">and</a>  don't necessarily reflect what is happening right now at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7088.3s">So</a>  during the survey, there were eight categories, cultural awareness and action, diversity and inclusion, school belonging, school climate, school engagement, school safety, student teacher relationships, and valuing of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7114.312s">As</a>  I said in my previous remarks, but I do want to preface before I go further with this presentation, that this survey was a benchmark, and we want to use the results of the survey as the beginning point so that we can measure progress and growth and use this data in a most meaningful way.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7142.205s">So</a>  as I mentioned, there were eight categories.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7147.89s">The</a>  eight categories, as we analyzed and looked carefully at the data and the responses, the areas as a school that we felt were strong areas, our strengths, were school belonging, school engagement, and valuing of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7171.943s">The</a>  area that was varied right in the middle was cultural awareness and action, school safety, and student-teacher relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7185.548s">The</a>  areas for growth that were identified from the survey, according to our interpretation, were diversity and inclusion and school climate.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7200.58s">Results</a>  by category. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7205.365s">Cultural</a>  awareness and action.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7208.508s">It</a>  was varied. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7210.27s">The</a>  question was, how often students learn about, discuss, and confront issues of race, ethnicity, and culture in their school? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7221.374s">A</a>  significant minority of respondents, our students, agreed that students at Medford High School were teased or picked on about their race or ethnicity or based upon their cultural background or religion. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7238.186s">An</a>  area that we identified as an area for growth fell in the category of diversity and inclusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7248.479s">which</a>  talked about the level of diversity integration and fairness for students of different races, ethnicities cultures and abilities or identities, about 40%. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7261.095s">responded</a>  that they agreed that at Medford High School, students were teased or picked on based on their physical or intellectual disability, or based upon their real or perceived sexual orientation.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7284.44s">So</a>  as an action item, under diversity and inclusion,</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7294.249s">The</a>  Medford School Committee proposed and approved the new bullying prevention and intervention plan for this school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7305.554s">So</a>  our next steps as a district, October 15th, principals reviewed our bullying plan, the revised bullying prevention and intervention plan with their staff during school-based staff meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7322.856s">at</a>  our upcoming November 7th meeting on there will be a bullying presentation during the morning session of district wide professional development. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7333.384s">And</a>  later during the month of November, we will be having a parent presentation by an outside presenter who will be coming to present to our greater community.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7350.598s">Moving</a>  forward, additional results under cultural awareness.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7360.145s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7363.307s">Under</a>  school belonging, we identified that as a strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7369.091s">How</a>  much students feel that they are valued members of the community, 90% felt that they belonged and they were accepted in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7380.358s">It</a>  was clear for us that the majority felt that they had many chances to be part of class discussions, extracurricular activities, and school-sponsored events and activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7393.504s">Two-thirds</a>  of the students felt that they are part of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7399.467s">At</a>  the same time, an area for growth was school climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7404.189s">That</a>  was the overall social and learning climate of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7410.552s">A</a>  substantial number agreed that people of different backgrounds get along well at Medford High School and more and that was really saying about greater than 80% and more than two thirds didn't feel that students are often bullied. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7429.355s">An</a>  area that students clearly identified as an area for growth to support a healthy climate had to do with school bathrooms and school grounds and that they didn't feel they were sufficiently maintained last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7446.892s">So</a>  there were mixed results, measures related to healthy and effective conflict resolution and discipline. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7455.738s">So</a>  that is an area we know that we will continue to target and work on specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7463.863s">Moving</a>  forward, our action items for that <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7474.838s">Student</a>  bathrooms, including gender neutral bathrooms are available on each floor throughout this throughout the school day assistant principals and building monitors and engagement specialists conduct regular walkthroughs of the hallway common and bathroom spaces so we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7494.917s">additional</a>  structures in place where we're receiving timely feedback in order to ensure that those areas are being maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7504.043s">Custodians</a>  are conducting regular cleaning schedules on all of our bathrooms and facilities and grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7511.768s">They've</a>  adopted a new landscaping routine to improve the Medford High School campus. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7520.08s">Also</a>  Medford High, we have submitted an MSBA application for the renewal to have a new and improved high school with the desire of long-term improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7537.274s">Page</a>  11, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7539.356s">Under</a>  student voice, Medford High School is committed to continued events <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7549.582s">is</a>  committed to continued efforts to build school community and expand opportunities for student voice and leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7558.449s">So</a>  there are regular student advisory blocks with community building activities built in. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7565.115s">There</a>  are facilitated activities now during lunch and other opportunities for students to engage using the gymnasium. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7578.16s">We</a>  are building, continuing to build community through the house model and additional student feedback is going to be gathered through follow-up surveys and student group sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7595.376s">Our</a>  assistant principals are also going to be trained on increasing student voice, opportunities for greater student voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7606.4s">Page</a>  12. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7607.842s">Another</a>  area of strength was school engagement, student attentiveness and investments in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7617.015s">Nearly</a>  all respondents indicated that there were positive measures on school engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7624.225s">88%</a>  agreed that a teacher or another adult at school would notice their absence. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7631.031s">And</a>  90% felt that they have the opportunity to participate in class discussions or activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7638.637s">And</a>  93% reported that there are many opportunities for student involvement in activities outside of the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7647.425s">Again,</a>  that was a great area of strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7651.138s">varied,</a>  again, student physical and psychological safety within the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7658.462s">Again,</a>  we did have 60% of students agree that they feel safe at school, but many also felt that students at the school regularly fight, steal, or use substances such as drugs or alcohol at school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7679.128s">80%</a>  of respondents said that there is a teacher or some other adult who students can go to if they need help because of sexual assault or dating violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7690.392s">So</a>  they do feel that there is a trusted adult who would be able to provide support in the event of those situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7700.895s">Under</a>  student-teacher relationships, that was identified as an area that was varied. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7708.891s">And</a>  this is the strength of social connections between students and teachers within and beyond the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7714.858s">70%</a>  felt that they had strong social connections with their teachers within and beyond the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7724.71s">And</a>  most of them felt that their teachers cared about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7731.055s">However,</a>  at the same time, there was a minority of 45% of respondents that felt adults working at the school did not treat all students with respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7744.241s">And</a>  so that is something where we are working on all of that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7749.544s">And</a>  we identified that as varied because there were different results. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7755.927s">Another</a>  area that was identified as a strength <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7760.117s">was</a>  valuing a school, how much do students feel that school is interesting, important, and useful? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7770.112s">55%</a>  of the students indicated that the things they're learning in school are important to them and connected to life outside of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7778.156s">And</a>  90% responded that their teachers expect them to do their best. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7785.039s">And</a>  73% felt that they could talk to a teacher or adult at the school about something that was bothering them. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7801.061s">So</a>  when we opened, I showed this screen, and again, the areas that we identified as clear strengths were school belonging, school engagement, and valuing of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7813.852s">The</a>  areas that were varied were cultural awareness and action, school safety, and student-teacher relationships. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7821.799s">And</a>  the areas for growth were diversity and inclusion and school climate. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7829.016s">I</a>  say once again that this survey was given at the end of last school year, and that we are looking at this data as a benchmark, and not a report card. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7841.664s">Our</a>  intention is to continue with the reforms that have taken place thus far. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7849.369s">remedies</a>  and improvements that are clearly underway at the high school to lead to more favorable responses in the future culture and climate surveys that will be given this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7862.313s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7865.493s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Woodson. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7867.394s">Are</a>  there any questions from the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7869.234s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7871.055s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7874.196s">Thank</a>  you for going through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7875.546s">I</a>  had a couple of questions specific to the, or comments then, I guess, questions specific to some of the outliers in terms of DEI and climate overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7890.735s">I</a>  know that you said that there was a survey, you know, that at some point should be a follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7895.879s">And</a>  I would ask that in a follow-up, I know that we have our director of data here tonight as well, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7901.909s">I</a>  would ask that in a follow up for the background questions, we include a question on whether the student is an English learner, a student with a disability, or economically disadvantaged, so that we're getting an idea of who, you know, we're breaking, disaggregating that data as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7922.382s">That</a>  would be feedback that I would respectfully ask be included in a future <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7928.717s">demographic,</a>  and then especially around some of the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7932.559s">So</a>  around the diversity and inclusion, two things, well, a few things. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7936.081s">One</a>  is, so students, it's obviously sad and upsetting to read some of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7945.127s">Students</a>  at the school are teased or picked on about their physical or intellectual disability or real or perceived sexual orientation. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7953.271s">I'm</a>  glad that the students are answering honestly in this, and I also, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7958.072s">you</a>  know, find it very upsetting and disturbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7962.113s">And</a>  so a couple of questions about that one is, I'm wondering what what happened or if it still exists, the DEI committee that was created, I forget we had a different name for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7974.055s">But</a>  I can't remember the name off the top of my head right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7978.376s">I</a>  know that a number of community members and a number of faculty members were part of that is that <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7983.513s">happening</a>  not happening.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7985.055s">So,</a>  the rate the race equity task force, and we have not reconvene this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=7991.786s">So</a>  we need to select new students, and, but we have not started this year yet, the race equity task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8000.597s">This</a>  is the first time this data is being presented to the committee first. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8006.118s">We</a>  have not shared it with staff or the greater community yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8012.3s">We</a>  wanted to present the data here. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8013.98s">And</a>  again, even as we looked at all of the categories, you take the information, <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8026.297s">where</a>  the pluses were, where the deltas were, and where there were mixed results, and look at that and say, okay, where are we going to improve? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8035.721s">You</a>  know, where were the low-hanging fruit? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8037.322s">What</a>  was the low-hanging fruit? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8038.583s">What</a>  few things could we do immediately? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8042.104s">Where</a>  some of the areas where we had some of the really low marks, we were able to put some changes in right away to start tackling those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8052.689s">And</a>  then some of these areas which are more complex, working collaboratively, you know, using our advisory blocks and other opportunities where students are together to be able to have conversations with our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8072.024s">Again,</a>  you don't know until you get the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8075.267s">And</a>  then once you have the data, you say, okay, how are we going to use this to inform our next steps? <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8083.953s">you</a>  know, we realize that this was a snapshot in time, but we also realize like we still have work to do, but we need to share it with the other stakeholders as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/5dIZAL7mP78&t=8096.215s">So</a>  they can look at it and unpack the data for themselves and see the responses of the students and then, you know, go forward with that.</p>
