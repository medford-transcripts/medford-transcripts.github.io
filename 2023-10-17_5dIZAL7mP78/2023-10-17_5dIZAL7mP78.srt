35
00:41:33,129 --> 00:41:42,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to begin this evening with a reflection on the challenging week that so many in our community have experienced with the outbreak of war in Israel.

36
00:41:44,375 --> 00:41:53,841
[SPEAKER_03]: As this conflict continues to escalate, we should take some time to think about how the news from Israel and Palestine might affect our students.

37
00:41:55,683 --> 00:42:02,625
[SPEAKER_03]: More and more of the devastation and violence is being shown on social media, from news outlets to individual accounts.

38
00:42:03,946 --> 00:42:15,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Content moderators on many platforms are overwhelmed and ill-equipped, meaning that all social media users are likely to encounter graphic or misleading content.

39
00:42:17,116 --> 00:42:31,255
[SPEAKER_03]: We strongly, strongly encourage our caregivers of our younger students to closely monitor any online activity to ensure that children are not being exposed to inappropriate content.

40
00:42:32,456 --> 00:42:49,124
[SPEAKER_03]: We also agree with advice from experts that older children with access to the internet should be encouraged to be skeptical of videos shared on social media and offered help with evaluating the news sources that they are using.

41
00:42:50,908 --> 00:43:00,050
[SPEAKER_03]: We are here for all of our community, especially those with loved ones and friends facing the atrocities of this war firsthand.

42
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:04,991
[SPEAKER_03]: We strongly condemn the terror attacks perpetuated by Hamas.

43
00:43:05,591 --> 00:43:13,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Moreover, we join our community in grief for the lives broken and lost in this last week.

44
00:43:14,833 --> 00:43:26,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Amid these upsetting events, I am reminded of how fortunate and privileged we are to live in a safe and loving community here in Medford.

45
00:43:27,457 --> 00:43:34,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope we can all stand together to support our neighbors and community members in this difficult moment.

46
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,481
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to transition and share some news, important news from the district.

77
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:10,425
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medford School Committee has a uniquely prominent role in long-term planning, goal setting, and visioning for the district.

[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to working with the members to develop superintendent goals, which harmonize with and complement our districts ambitions and priorities.

80
00:48:30,906 --> 00:48:46,951

[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say thank you to the members for recommending changes to the presentation of the data in the full report to improve clarity.

88
00:49:35,725 --> 00:49:53,900
[SPEAKER_19]: I wanna take a moment that working with the high school leadership, we've worked to put out the information on the Medford Student Advisory Council, which will then serve to make sure that there are student members at every single school committee, regular school committee meeting moving forward, beginning with our November meetings.

95
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:54,271
[SPEAKER_19]: As this group requested last year through a resolution,

96
00:50:54,898 --> 00:51:10,843
[SPEAKER_19]: To propose dates I've proposed dates during the day for meetings with this group of students that do not conflict with other opportunities that are half days or other things along those lines.

97
00:51:12,123 --> 00:51:18,745
[SPEAKER_19]: I defer to this body to establish your meeting dates, but that was something that was mentioned.

98
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:30,327
[SPEAKER_19]: I do also make a couple of policy recommendations there to make sure that we have multiple representatives at school committee.

99
00:51:30,928 --> 00:51:38,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Oftentimes, it may be taxing on students, as was definitely the case last year when taking care of siblings.

[SPEAKER_19]: working jobs, sports, dance, and fill in the other thing, any other thing that I think the high school students, I will say, high school students, in my experience, are the busiest people around and wanna make sure that we're providing them a great opportunity.

[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's that's wonderful both for for us to get input from the students, but you know, for them to get the experience of being involved

141
00:54:00,683 --> 00:54:02,204
[SPEAKER_04]: more directly with democracy.

142
00:54:03,685 --> 00:54:09,928
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question really, I have is, you know, there really is a very specific policy and law.

143
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:18,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering how this is going to be hopefully shaped a little bit to more closely fit that.

144
00:54:18,513 --> 00:54:20,874
[SPEAKER_04]: The 13 students is, again, it's wonderful.

145
00:54:20,894 --> 00:54:27,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you're thinking of having a combination of, you know, the policy calls for five students, and I think

146
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:36,758
[SPEAKER_04]: My assumption is that's an attempt to make it less unwieldy if you have a lot of students trying to meet with school committee, so that they can have a more direct involvement.

147
00:54:37,098 --> 00:54:46,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering if there's a way, or if you're considering a way of trying to, for those meetings, maybe have a subset of students attend?

148
00:54:46,685 --> 00:54:48,066
[SPEAKER_19]: We could definitely consider that.

149
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:52,650
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be honest, throughout this work, I've always tried to expand the voice of students.

150
00:54:53,834 --> 00:55:01,076
[SPEAKER_19]: And when I read that law, similar to the school site council law, it's wide latitude for interpretation.

151
00:55:01,117 --> 00:55:15,521
[SPEAKER_19]: And I interpreted that after consulting other members of this board previously to that, to really be a minimum, like for five to be a minimum number and that to really try to expand the opportunities for student voice.

152
00:55:16,321 --> 00:55:19,382
[SPEAKER_19]: High school students, especially, I will also say the law says nothing.

153
00:55:19,402 --> 00:55:21,763
[SPEAKER_19]: It is completely silent on middle school students.

154
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:27,509
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know for a fact that middle school students have really great ideas and a lot to share.

155
00:55:27,809 --> 00:55:30,331
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we've expanded it down to the middle school as well.

156
00:55:30,752 --> 00:55:49,308
[SPEAKER_19]: While those are not required to be part of school committee meetings, I would invite any group, less than four, I think it is, to come and join us at any point to be able to listen and converse and meet with those middle school students because some of the stuff that they've offered has been really tremendous and enlightening over the years.

157
00:55:50,401 --> 00:55:59,567
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've interpreted that, or I should say I, in this role, have really interpreted it as more of a minimum than an absolute of five.

158
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:13,214
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I would just say, I mean, we had, I think we had a similar discussion about this already, because I know you have these preexisting student advisory councils, and actually it's pretty specific in saying five students in terms of the law and the policy.

159
00:56:13,514 --> 00:56:17,497
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not that I'm stuck on the five students, but I do think that there's a reason for that.

160
00:56:17,617 --> 00:56:19,598
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe that most likely the reason

161
00:56:20,071 --> 00:56:33,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it's to give students a more direct, if you've got 13 students trying to meet with us, the opportunities for each student to really be involved are going to be less than if you have a smaller number of students directly involved in those meetings.

162
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:46,965
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'd love to see if there's a way you can maybe try to give each student obviously a chance to do that, but maybe have a smaller meetings that there is more opportunity for them to really be directly involved

163
00:56:47,355 --> 00:57:02,867
[SPEAKER_04]: in having a conversation with school committee, whoever's able, I think we'll need to look at, again, coordinating those meetings to figure out if there's gonna be a subset of us who can make it to those meetings or whether it's a whole committee, which would be obviously the ideal.

164
00:57:04,828 --> 00:57:08,411
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm glad to see this is getting started and I really appreciate the work you've put into this.

165
00:57:08,471 --> 00:57:11,493
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, it's exciting to see that there's so many students who really wanna be involved.

166
00:57:11,674 --> 00:57:12,374
[SPEAKER_19]: I appreciate that.

167
00:57:13,882 --> 00:57:27,704
[SPEAKER_19]: Perhaps we look at elections within the group of students or something along those lines, but I just wanna make sure that when I've looked at other communities too, they've expanded far beyond just 13, and we're hoping to build that over time.

168
00:57:29,265 --> 00:57:42,807
[SPEAKER_19]: And to find a way so that it's not unwieldy, I'm definitely committed to that, but I am also just throughout my time as assistant principal and now, the greatest change has come from the voice of the students.

169
00:57:43,428 --> 00:57:55,311
[SPEAKER_19]: And the greatest push oftentimes comes from when you have students on your side advocating that we can really help to move their progress and move a district's progress forward.

170
00:57:56,031 --> 00:57:56,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

171
00:57:56,491 --> 00:58:04,272
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that was the reason why the state put this in place for us to make sure that school districts are doing that and really getting the voice of the students involved.

172
00:58:04,332 --> 00:58:06,053
[SPEAKER_04]: So look forward to getting this going.

173
00:58:06,993 --> 00:58:07,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

174
00:58:08,753 --> 00:58:09,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

175
00:58:09,414 --> 00:58:09,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham?

176
00:58:11,843 --> 00:58:13,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a couple of questions.

177
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:18,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a time of day that you are targeting for these meetings?

178
00:58:19,424 --> 00:58:21,645
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be meeting monthly with the students after school.

179
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,005
[SPEAKER_05]: But these dates that are on our.

180
00:58:24,605 --> 00:58:25,585
[SPEAKER_19]: I leave that up to the committee.

181
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:26,406
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not suggesting.

182
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:30,806
[SPEAKER_19]: These were the dates that fit based on the conversation last June.

183
00:58:30,826 --> 00:58:36,067
[SPEAKER_19]: I went through and these are the dates that fit every other month within.

184
00:58:36,327 --> 00:58:39,928
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would defer to the committee as to what time works best.

185
00:58:41,212 --> 00:58:44,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a time of day that would work best for students?

186
00:58:44,334 --> 00:58:53,017
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think just practically speaking, if it's going to be inside the school day, there's going to be some finagling on our end to get there.

187
00:58:53,578 --> 00:59:01,641
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we could be least disruptive to students, given that we have to do that to our schedules anyway, I think I would be fine with that.

188
00:59:01,721 --> 00:59:04,282
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if there's a good time or a bad time.

189
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:10,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know enough about the high school schedule to know is there some magical space where

190
00:59:10,734 --> 00:59:13,556
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not pulling them out of classes or what have you.

191
00:59:13,956 --> 00:59:18,299
[SPEAKER_19]: Would you prefer immediately after school at 2.30 or would you prefer during the school day?

192
00:59:21,081 --> 00:59:22,081
[SPEAKER_19]: After school, okay.

193
00:59:22,662 --> 00:59:28,906
[SPEAKER_19]: So my suggestion would then be 2.30 to make sure that we're able to- Aren't these all on Wednesdays?

194
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that early release?

195
00:59:30,086 --> 00:59:30,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

196
00:59:30,327 --> 00:59:31,587
[SPEAKER_19]: No, they're not early release days.

197
00:59:31,888 --> 00:59:32,608
[SPEAKER_19]: I avoided those.

198
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:40,153
[SPEAKER_19]: Having tried to have the meetings on early release days, thinking that would be, no, it didn't really work.

199
00:59:41,508 --> 00:59:43,369
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you've visited a few of these meetings.

200
00:59:43,649 --> 00:59:44,690
[SPEAKER_19]: So, which was great.

201
00:59:47,371 --> 00:59:53,014
[SPEAKER_05]: So, in terms of the dates proposed, I am fine with all those dates except for the January date.

202
00:59:53,074 --> 01:00:05,001
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a date that I will be able to be there at but all the rest are fine for me and I think we just need to make sure that we post the meeting and they

203
01:00:09,461 --> 01:00:12,922
[SPEAKER_05]: if other members of the community want to join us, they know how to do that.

204
01:00:13,463 --> 01:00:21,466
[SPEAKER_05]: But so, if the committee wants to keep that January 17th date, I I'm totally fine with that.

205
01:00:21,526 --> 01:00:28,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I just I definitely know that I can't be there and I also know that there will be at least three new members of the committee.

206
01:00:28,969 --> 01:00:33,530
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't wanna make promises on behalf of people who can't tell us about their schedule.

207
01:00:34,591 --> 01:00:36,031
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's my other sort of concern.

208
01:00:36,051 --> 01:00:36,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how we work

209
01:00:38,871 --> 01:00:46,296
[SPEAKER_05]: decide on what the dates are because otherwise, you know, it's going to be really hard to manage the execution of that.

210
01:00:49,798 --> 01:00:58,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on the students requesting immediately after school, I can work with Ms.

211
01:00:58,323 --> 01:01:06,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Malone to send out calendar holds for like a 2.30 to 3.30 block of time, maybe a one hour block

212
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:09,933
[SPEAKER_03]: and then everyone will get it if that's helpful.

213
01:01:12,895 --> 01:01:13,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Rizzo.

214
01:01:13,995 --> 01:01:14,356
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

215
01:01:14,536 --> 01:01:20,120
[SPEAKER_17]: I just also want to remind us from a security perspective that the high school must be unlocked and open for these meetings.

216
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:23,222
[SPEAKER_17]: These are public meetings, just like these.

217
01:01:23,982 --> 01:01:33,009
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't have locked doors, so we'll have to plan the security around that, unless we don't have a quorum of members, in which case it's just a meeting.

218
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:35,651
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's important to remember.

219
01:01:37,089 --> 01:01:46,855
[SPEAKER_17]: When posting the agenda, if more than three of us show up, none of us are speaking about anything related to policy, unless it's already on the agenda.

220
01:01:47,195 --> 01:02:00,984
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just, my biggest concern about these meetings, which I obviously want to hear from the students, is I don't want each of these meetings to be a series of open meeting law violations, because nobody really wants to deal with those.

221
01:02:02,044 --> 01:02:04,726
[SPEAKER_17]: So somebody will have to plan the effort around

222
01:02:05,529 --> 01:02:09,930
[SPEAKER_17]: making our high school open at 230 when there's clubs and all the other stuff.

223
01:02:11,831 --> 01:02:17,652
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I assume we're going to have them there, it doesn't make sense to cart the students over here, that doesn't make any sense.

224
01:02:18,573 --> 01:02:27,275
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just want to make sure those logistics are worked out, rather than on the 17th or the 15th of November, when we sit down and we have a quorum.

225
01:02:28,038 --> 01:02:33,442
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there's a locked door because that's just not gonna be acceptable.

226
01:02:34,062 --> 01:02:36,204
[SPEAKER_17]: It's also against, it's a violation, so.

227
01:02:37,935 --> 01:02:57,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm willing to reach out to MASC and if we need to post it as a, I don't know, special meeting, student advisory special meeting to be held at the high school, maybe we can use the library or a larger open space.

228
01:02:57,332 --> 01:03:04,698
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, I mean, if we're speaking at all, then if there's four of us, then it is a meeting.

229
01:03:06,011 --> 01:03:09,192
[SPEAKER_17]: an official meeting that will have an agenda posted following open meeting law.

230
01:03:09,672 --> 01:03:23,856
[SPEAKER_17]: If we all swear to sit silently and listen or nod and be jovial and not engage in a single item of a policy for which we have authority, then I don't think that's a meeting, that's just four or more of us happen to be in the same place.

231
01:03:23,876 --> 01:03:24,977
[SPEAKER_06]: What's point of information?

232
01:03:25,497 --> 01:03:26,957
[SPEAKER_06]: That's unless it's on the agenda.

233
01:03:27,137 --> 01:03:27,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information.

234
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:28,918
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, yes.

235
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:34,323
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's items on the agenda, we can speak to those items, which is why I asked if there would be an agenda.

236
01:03:34,383 --> 01:03:36,104
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will have an agenda.

237
01:03:36,664 --> 01:03:41,147
[SPEAKER_17]: An agenda, though, can be just that we're having a meeting and we're showing up and we're going to listen to the students.

238
01:03:41,808 --> 01:03:47,851
[SPEAKER_17]: That's an agenda, an agenda that has items such as we're going to talk about food service or we're going to talk about this.

239
01:03:48,852 --> 01:03:50,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are different kinds of agendas.

240
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:51,254
[SPEAKER_17]: They're both agendas.

241
01:03:52,014 --> 01:03:56,797
[SPEAKER_17]: And Medford has a long history of showing up to talk about whatever anybody wants to talk about.

242
01:03:57,842 --> 01:03:59,963
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's not how open meeting law works.

243
01:04:00,783 --> 01:04:07,627
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just don't want to be the person sitting there silently because I don't want to violate open meeting law on a topic that I care greatly about.

244
01:04:07,647 --> 01:04:10,668
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my biggest beef, frankly.

245
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:14,850
[SPEAKER_17]: If other members feel comfortable ignoring that, that's up to them.

246
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:23,935
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't want to sit here silently looking like a jerk because I won't say anything on a topic that's not on the agenda for which we have authority.

247
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:24,655
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

248
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:28,230
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham and then Member McLaughlin.

249
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:30,550
[SPEAKER_10]: I had my hand raised too.

250
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you can see.

251
01:04:32,051 --> 01:04:32,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I can't see it.

252
01:04:32,751 --> 01:04:33,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, no problem.

253
01:04:33,591 --> 01:04:35,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Graham, Member McLaughlin, and then Member Hays.

254
01:04:36,632 --> 01:04:38,113
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Member Kreatz.

255
01:04:38,133 --> 01:04:39,173
[SPEAKER_05]: No problem.

256
01:04:39,513 --> 01:04:42,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think, to me, there's a couple of things.

257
01:04:43,034 --> 01:04:48,896
[SPEAKER_05]: If we are going to have an officially posted school committee meeting, there has to be a quorum.

258
01:04:49,396 --> 01:04:52,897
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think we do need to orchestrate whether

259
01:04:53,615 --> 01:05:06,003
[SPEAKER_05]: there are in fact four members of the committee who can be at each of these meetings because if they're not, we can still hold the meetings, but they get held differently and they are not publicly posted meetings.

260
01:05:06,103 --> 01:05:10,726
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we post a meeting, there has to be a quorum in order for the meeting to go forward.

261
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:15,950
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can't post a meeting and just have three people show up because then we can't have the meeting.

262
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:19,012
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there needs to be a little bit of orchestration around

263
01:05:19,676 --> 01:05:21,097
[SPEAKER_05]: who is coming.

264
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:26,920
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that will drive like exactly how the meeting can happen on our end.

265
01:05:27,441 --> 01:05:41,749
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think also like if there is a posted meeting, it would be helpful if the students could sort of identify a set of topics that they want to talk to us about so that those can be posted on an agenda if we're having an official meeting.

266
01:05:42,230 --> 01:06:02,443
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing I would suggest is we can hold a Zoom meeting and then there's no requirement for the high school to be unlocked, which creates other safety issues and concerns, but the students could certainly join from a common place to our meeting on Zoom, as long as the meeting is posted to be an exclusively Zoom oriented meeting.

267
01:06:03,644 --> 01:06:11,729
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there are some options there that don't require us to open the high school to be in compliance with the law, the open meeting law,

268
01:06:13,309 --> 01:06:15,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we are allowed to host meetings on zoom.

269
01:06:15,550 --> 01:06:29,236
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we as a body need to be clear about who is able to join each meeting because that will drop that should drive and set the like rules of engagement around making sure that we can actually have a dialogue.

270
01:06:30,276 --> 01:06:34,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will happen differently based on how many of us are able to join at any given time.

271
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,099
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we need to make sure that

272
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:45,151
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, we can certainly talk about the November meeting because all of us here are the folks that have to be available for that November meeting.

273
01:06:45,171 --> 01:06:56,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Um but I think we probably just need to have another conversation about those meetings as they come up so that we have the right rules in place for everybody.

274
01:06:56,196 --> 01:06:58,197
[SPEAKER_19]: And if I could just interject real quick.

275
01:06:58,738 --> 01:07:03,780
[SPEAKER_19]: The the dates are only suggested so we can do the November and then worry about when the new

276
01:07:07,321 --> 01:07:07,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Sounds good.

277
01:07:07,721 --> 01:07:09,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Kreatz.

278
01:07:11,082 --> 01:07:11,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

279
01:07:12,463 --> 01:07:20,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this is a great opportunity actually for the student advisory to understand governance and how it works.

280
01:07:20,945 --> 01:07:29,808
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I actually would make a motion that they are offered some training by MASC.

281
01:07:31,612 --> 01:07:36,015
[SPEAKER_06]: a short training, an hour or so training by MASC just around sort of some of the basics.

282
01:07:36,035 --> 01:07:39,217
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're understanding this and then also understanding the agenda items.

283
01:07:39,277 --> 01:07:53,446
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, to member Rousseau's point and to other folks' point, when they come to these public meetings, they don't understand why they can't talk about something that's on, that's not on the agenda, that can be really frustrating.

284
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:55,628
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the students to be able to really understand

285
01:07:56,528 --> 01:08:05,192
[SPEAKER_06]: why it needs to be on the agenda and sort of just a basic primer, I would love for them to have some opportunity to be trained instead of just being sort of thrown into this role.

286
01:08:05,312 --> 01:08:14,256
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm making a motion that we ask MASC Dorothy to provide a one-hour training to our student advisory body so that they understand.

287
01:08:14,276 --> 01:08:17,638
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just writing down Dorothy Presser's name prior to, so thank you.

288
01:08:18,478 --> 01:08:18,999
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you say?

289
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:21,540
[SPEAKER_19]: I was just writing down Dorothy Presser's name called Dorothy.

290
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:22,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

291
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,141
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just need a second.

292
01:08:26,794 --> 01:08:33,716
[SPEAKER_10]: The administration will look into an MASC training for our student advisory students.

293
01:08:34,997 --> 01:08:37,257
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz.

294
01:08:37,698 --> 01:08:38,438
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

295
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:38,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

296
01:08:39,638 --> 01:08:40,358
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

297
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:42,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion is passed.

298
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:43,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Kreatz.

299
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:44,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sorry.

300
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:49,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say I can't make the November 15th meeting.

301
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:50,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an appointment.

302
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:52,122
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to

303
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:56,661
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a good date for me, but that's, you know, if there's a quorum and everybody can be there, that's fine.

304
01:08:57,541 --> 01:09:05,623
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be unfortunate, and it sounds like a wonderful experience, and I really like the idea of the MAAC training with Dorothy, because it's useful.

305
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:11,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really helpful for us, and you'll learn a lot, and a lot of takeaways from that.

306
01:09:12,024 --> 01:09:13,405
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for putting this together.

307
01:09:16,746 --> 01:09:17,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

308
01:09:17,306 --> 01:09:17,566
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

309
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:18,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

310
01:09:20,516 --> 01:09:29,144
[SPEAKER_10]: We have number three report on superintendents goals for school year 2023 2024 and update on the status of the metric school committee goals.

311
01:09:30,144 --> 01:09:34,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Maurice Edouard-Vincent superintendent, this was previously tabled from 10 to 2023.

312
01:09:34,308 --> 01:09:43,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if Dr. Cushing you're able to share it, if that's a possibility.

313
01:09:44,557 --> 01:09:44,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

314
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:52,470
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are draft goals for school year 23-24.

315
01:09:54,512 --> 01:10:01,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first goal is our district improvement goal.

316
01:10:05,123 --> 01:10:06,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

317
01:10:10,851 --> 01:10:32,069
[SPEAKER_03]: The district improvement goal for the draft goal, again, I'm waiting for additional feedback from the committee, is that during the school year 23-24, the Medford Public Schools will improve systems and structures that directly impact student services, student and family and communications, and school facilities and operations.

318
01:10:35,572 --> 01:10:50,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goals are to continue to maintain a learning environment built upon the pillars of safety, equity and consistency, creating a culture that values consistent communication and safe and accessible school facilities for all.

319
01:10:51,676 --> 01:10:54,836
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were six key actions that were proposed.

320
01:10:57,037 --> 01:11:02,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first key action was again, improving physical accessibility at school facilities,

321
01:11:03,084 --> 01:11:05,406
[SPEAKER_03]: and developing a maintenance ticket system.

322
01:11:07,047 --> 01:11:09,269
[SPEAKER_03]: That was recommended by the committee as well.

323
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:21,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Consistent communication to families across all schools, including student services such as athletics, counseling, career services, and student governance.

324
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:30,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Three, effective and appropriate and consistent messaging during any emergency scenario.

325
01:11:32,327 --> 01:11:41,131
[SPEAKER_03]: for reestablish the capital planning committee to examine building systems in creating a replacement timeline.

326
01:11:42,785 --> 01:11:49,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Five, seizing every opportunity to collaborate with MSBA to improve facilities and building systems.

327
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:57,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do have another meeting scheduled this week on October 19th with MSBA.

328
01:11:58,015 --> 01:12:03,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, informational meetings for all districts that have applied to MSBA.

329
01:12:03,858 --> 01:12:06,340
[SPEAKER_03]: And number six,

330
01:12:07,981 --> 01:12:15,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Enhancing our human resource practices, such as job postings hiring and payroll management.

331
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:29,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some of the proposed outcomes would be increasing accessibility and parking pedestrian restroom facilities communication platforms, such as some more and final site.

332
01:12:31,071 --> 01:12:38,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mass notification systems that are going to be used regularly and consistently by all schools and student servicing groups.

333
01:12:39,718 --> 01:12:48,946
[SPEAKER_03]: We would like to have well documented model communications and templates that are going to be utilized by all school administrators.

334
01:12:51,414 --> 01:13:01,957
[SPEAKER_03]: and officials so that, again, things are standardized and streamlined for any kind of emergency communication scenario.

335
01:13:04,317 --> 01:13:16,700
[SPEAKER_03]: A capital planning committee, reviews of every single school would be one of our outcomes and streamlined and more effective job postings and onboarding procedures

336
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,141
[SPEAKER_03]: for our staff.

337
01:13:18,741 --> 01:13:24,485
[SPEAKER_03]: So these were the draft recommended district improvement goals.

338
01:13:25,686 --> 01:13:46,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to just move to our student learning goals, which are, we continue to use literacy as our student learning goal, an area that we really want to focus in on and continue to develop greater strategies and strengths.

339
01:13:46,900 --> 01:14:02,598
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, our student learning goal would be to assess literacy skills and implementing interventions in literacy to improve outcomes by deepening teacher and principal knowledge of literacy practices.

340
01:14:03,938 --> 01:14:21,106
[SPEAKER_03]: while maintaining a district wide focus on instruction and assessment through the continued use of our in-house system NWEA map dibbles, and our newly adopted literacy program into reading.

341
01:14:21,926 --> 01:14:24,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the goal is similar to last year.

342
01:14:24,788 --> 01:14:31,071
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we have catered it to really be specific to where we are at this point in time.

343
01:14:31,971 --> 01:14:33,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have six key actions.

344
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:39,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, many of them were repeated from last year, but the work continues.

345
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:46,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of now that we've officially selected our literacy program into reading.

346
01:14:48,771 --> 01:15:01,757
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to do all of the things possible to continue to make sure that that programming and the significant financial investment really has the opportunity to get really strong traction within the district.

347
01:15:02,437 --> 01:15:14,343
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will continue as a district to follow DESE's, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education's dyslexia guidance, which we've been doing for multiple years.

348
01:15:15,763 --> 01:15:17,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're using inter-reading.

349
01:15:17,384 --> 01:15:21,865
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also doing ECRI, which stands for Enhanced Core Reading Instruction.

350
01:15:22,785 --> 01:15:30,467
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're using DIBLS, which I mentioned earlier, but it stands for the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills.

351
01:15:30,948 --> 01:15:35,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And those assessments are used, DIBLS is used with our youngest learners.

352
01:15:37,089 --> 01:15:42,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, tier one ELA blocks in all grades for kindergarten to grade two.

353
01:15:43,411 --> 01:15:48,113
[SPEAKER_03]: district wide, and we have a continued partnership with Hill for Literacy.

354
01:15:48,914 --> 01:15:54,056
[SPEAKER_03]: During the 23-24 school year, there is embedded professional development.

355
01:15:54,596 --> 01:16:01,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week I had the opportunity to participate in professional development with the Missittuck School, third grade.

356
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:10,944
[SPEAKER_03]: And so coaching is being provided that's going to really support instruction and help teachers to look

357
01:16:11,324 --> 01:16:15,106
[SPEAKER_03]: at their specific literacy data.

358
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:29,674
[SPEAKER_03]: We will continue to use NWEA map again as our district in-house district assessment so that we can have baseline beginning of year data, middle of year data, and then end of year data.

359
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:32,956
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can monitor our own progress and growth.

360
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:40,200
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will continue to work with our elementary district literacy leadership team, the DLLT.

361
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:44,862
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of work happening in literacy it's critical work right now.

362
01:16:45,662 --> 01:16:51,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are beginning to see really positive payoff outcomes from that.

363
01:16:53,539 --> 01:16:59,083
[SPEAKER_03]: So we list some of the outcomes, scope and sequence for grades K to five.

364
01:17:00,264 --> 01:17:06,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford Public Schools is establishing data cycles that are going to be measuring our performance.

365
01:17:07,029 --> 01:17:18,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, this is a new area that we are really formally entering, working with partners and collaborators.

366
01:17:19,978 --> 01:17:28,669
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of our outcomes where we're saying visible implementation of the science of reading the best practices that are taking place during our literacy blocks.

367
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:38,062
[SPEAKER_03]: We have that listed as an outcome because again we've made a significant investment with every hill for literacy, and now with into reading.

368
01:17:38,682 --> 01:17:44,305
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the expectation is that this is what is being used every day in all of our classrooms.

369
01:17:45,246 --> 01:18:02,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So accountability measures, we would like to see under NWEA map, 65% of our students in grades two through 10 to meet or exceed their projected growth targets on the NWEA map assessments.

370
01:18:03,993 --> 01:18:14,460
[SPEAKER_03]: We would like to see for dibbles 90% of our elementary students, that they will make at least 10% growth in oral reading fluency.

371
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's words read correctly by June of 24.

372
01:18:20,444 --> 01:18:25,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And for professional development, Medford public schools will continue to provide targeted

373
01:18:27,288 --> 01:18:37,573
[SPEAKER_03]: targeted professional development for our elementary staff with inter-reading training every month during the 23-24 school year.

374
01:18:39,054 --> 01:18:43,176
[SPEAKER_03]: My final goal is the professional practice goal.

375
01:18:43,296 --> 01:18:44,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

376
01:18:45,197 --> 01:18:46,478
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is to engage.

377
01:18:48,499 --> 01:18:49,839
[SPEAKER_03]: I am continuing.

378
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,441
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Dr. Cushing, I'm actually using the screen share.

379
01:18:52,881 --> 01:18:53,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

380
01:18:54,122 --> 01:18:54,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I am

381
01:18:57,475 --> 01:19:03,260
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the superintendent, the BIPOC Superintendent Support Network of Massachusetts.

382
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:11,166
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still am participating with Leading Now, which is a national superintendent network.

383
01:19:11,986 --> 01:19:24,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And so participating in these two particular networks are providing me with a lot of current information to be able to continue to do this work.

384
01:19:24,856 --> 01:19:36,163
[SPEAKER_03]: In modern day times, we support one another, we work with one another, we look at race equity diversity and inclusion in education.

385
01:19:37,784 --> 01:19:41,186
[SPEAKER_03]: We, I attend monthly sessions.

386
01:19:41,306 --> 01:19:46,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Earlier today, I was part of the superintendent support network, where ma SS.

387
01:19:48,010 --> 01:20:02,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Tom Scott and Mary Bork, they participate as well in the first half of those professional development sessions, and we tack it tackle current problems of practice that Massachusetts is facing, or.

388
01:20:04,455 --> 01:20:06,516
[SPEAKER_03]: challenges that are happening across the nation.

389
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:09,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that is the work that I'm doing.

390
01:20:09,637 --> 01:20:27,542
[SPEAKER_03]: The key expected outcomes, again, are to leverage the expertise and collective knowledge of other colleagues in the state of Massachusetts and nationally, continuing to lead and learn about the impacts and the importance of REDI in education,

391
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:54,040
[SPEAKER_03]: and participating in continued collaboration with Middlesex County DA, Marion Ryan's office, who presents current problems of practice and challenges that Middlesex County is facing, not only in Medford, but again, across the county to be able to better support our students here in Medford and the community.

392
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:58,622
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are my proposed goals, and I await your feedback.

393
01:20:59,142 --> 01:20:59,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

394
01:20:59,622 --> 01:20:59,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor.

395
01:21:00,943 --> 01:21:01,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin.

396
01:21:01,983 --> 01:21:03,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, just a matter of procedure.

397
01:21:03,303 --> 01:21:13,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe we need to make a motion to take this off the table, so I'm motioning to take it off the table for since it was tabled on 10-2 before we start to speak.

398
01:21:16,607 --> 01:21:16,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

399
01:21:17,907 --> 01:21:19,648
[SPEAKER_10]: By Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

400
01:21:19,688 --> 01:21:20,448
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

401
01:21:20,668 --> 01:21:20,748
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

402
01:21:21,028 --> 01:21:21,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

403
01:21:21,428 --> 01:21:22,228
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

404
01:21:22,769 --> 01:21:23,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

405
01:21:25,249 --> 01:21:27,670
[SPEAKER_10]: So taking this off the table, there any comments?

406
01:21:28,635 --> 01:21:29,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin, do you have any comments?

407
01:21:29,736 --> 01:21:31,558
[SPEAKER_10]: What was that?

408
01:21:33,539 --> 01:21:34,160
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Hays.

409
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:35,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Hays and Member Graham.

410
01:21:37,563 --> 01:21:37,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

411
01:21:37,863 --> 01:21:41,727
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, hopefully you received it, Superintendent.

412
01:21:41,767 --> 01:21:47,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I sent you an email a little over a week ago, just with a couple of my comments and feedback.

413
01:21:48,072 --> 01:21:53,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one question I had from you is looking at the communication goals

414
01:21:54,550 --> 01:22:14,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I had requested that you look to add a goal that is more focused, again, we've talked about this, I think, in the past, on two-way communication, that again, the current goals are really focused on the district giving information to families, caregivers, students,

415
01:22:15,133 --> 01:22:37,616
[SPEAKER_04]: in looking again for a goal that may or an outcome, I guess, that would be more specifically focused on that two way communication and in my email to you, I talked about, you know, if you could commit to a number of events, such as monthly coffee hours or attendance at PTO meetings, that two way communication being that you put

416
01:22:38,168 --> 01:22:45,133
[SPEAKER_04]: you're having an event or in a way for parents to actually talk back to you and talk to you about their concerns.

417
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:52,498
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be that you focus it on a specific topic, or it could just be kind of an open, again, like a coffee hour.

418
01:22:53,019 --> 01:22:58,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of that, I think, like last year, you did have a wonderful budget meeting.

419
01:22:58,563 --> 01:23:06,728
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't, unfortunately, it wasn't as well attended as I'd hoped, but it was really well designed in terms of having the interpretation for families.

420
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:16,926
[SPEAKER_04]: So things like that, if you could commit to maybe putting that in one of your goals is a more specific way of getting at that two-way communication.

421
01:23:17,666 --> 01:23:30,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I can definitely add under outcomes increased two-way communication over the course of the year, because there are some events that take place at schools

422
01:23:31,603 --> 01:23:35,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on what is happening where I may be able to go and attend as well.

423
01:23:37,466 --> 01:23:41,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I, and I appreciate you sending this to me.

424
01:23:41,907 --> 01:23:45,749
[SPEAKER_03]: I just was waiting for you to share it with the entire committee.

425
01:23:46,429 --> 01:23:50,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I think it can be a combination.

426
01:23:51,179 --> 01:24:04,379
[SPEAKER_03]: of either coffee hour, or the PTO meeting some some take place virtually, or other types of parent engagement events.

427
01:24:06,934 --> 01:24:25,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am open to that, and I can have that added as increased under outcomes, increased two-way communication opportunities with families, including coffee hours or special events at schools.

428
01:24:25,884 --> 01:24:35,730
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I'm hoping what I'd like to see really is a really specific commitment to a minimum number of events that you would attend or create

429
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:41,904
[SPEAKER_04]: just so we really have something very concrete for when it comes time for the evaluation.

430
01:24:41,944 --> 01:24:44,546
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you want the entire goal to change?

431
01:24:44,566 --> 01:24:46,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking more at the outcomes.

432
01:24:46,928 --> 01:24:59,737
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't really have to change the goal itself, but one of the outcomes for communication would be, we'll attend a minimum of five events

433
01:25:01,215 --> 01:25:03,196
[SPEAKER_04]: or have a minimum of five coffee hours.

434
01:25:03,256 --> 01:25:22,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of let that open for you, what you feel most comfortable doing, whether you wanted to have it be more directed as in terms of being like a focus group that you want to focus on a topic or whether you want to leave it towards a more open ended kind of event where you have coffee hours and you can just chat with parents and they can bring whatever concerns they want to you.

435
01:25:25,603 --> 01:25:44,215
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm writing right now is increased two-way communication, increased two-way communication with families, with a minimum of five events over the course of the school year.

436
01:25:44,775 --> 01:25:46,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Sounds great.

437
01:25:50,699 --> 01:25:55,142
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did have one other piece, but I know others have their hands raised, so I can come back.

438
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:03,185
[SPEAKER_10]: If it's just one more, you can go member Hays, then member Graham, then member McLaughlin.

439
01:26:04,026 --> 01:26:05,107
[SPEAKER_10]: And then member Rizzo.

440
01:26:05,767 --> 01:26:18,118
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that I had asked of you was looking at the accountability, accountability under the literacy law.

441
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:27,583
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was a little unclear for the NWEA map when you say 65% students, grades two to 10.

442
01:26:28,603 --> 01:26:30,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that an aggregate of all of them?

443
01:26:30,804 --> 01:26:39,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I would love to see that more specific that, you know, we know that we have differences among schools in terms of how they perform.

444
01:26:39,969 --> 01:26:42,750
[SPEAKER_04]: So an aggregate really doesn't give us a complete picture.

445
01:26:44,473 --> 01:26:49,037
[SPEAKER_04]: across the schools, because we do have some that perform much higher and some that perform much lower.

446
01:26:49,077 --> 01:26:54,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you get the aggregate, either end gets a little bit, the information just isn't as clear.

447
01:26:56,003 --> 01:27:04,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was, my request has been for both of those two, the DIBELS and the NWEA map that you just had in the phrase at each school.

448
01:27:08,143 --> 01:27:21,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I think where my, my caution was just where some of the schools do have different programs, and we do have some different demographics.

449
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:26,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Our goal is definitely to see growth for all of our students.

450
01:27:27,773 --> 01:27:30,574
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not sure if it would end up.

451
01:27:33,397 --> 01:27:39,082
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially showing the data that maybe one school may outperform other schools.

452
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:45,488
[SPEAKER_03]: But we want to see progress and growth at every single school.

453
01:27:45,548 --> 01:27:54,137
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was trying to see if we could just combine everyone and see how are we moving as an entire district because we are looking

454
01:27:54,878 --> 01:27:56,319
[SPEAKER_03]: at our data.

455
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:01,563
[SPEAKER_03]: We do disaggregate it and look at it through other lenses as well.

456
01:28:02,964 --> 01:28:17,255
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just not sure if... That doesn't give us the ability to see whether individual schools are making progress, because it is true that sometimes one school outperforms another, and I think that's information that we need to have as a school committee

457
01:28:17,734 --> 01:28:19,614
[SPEAKER_04]: when we're making decisions and budgeting.

458
01:28:20,434 --> 01:28:29,216
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also is information that the community needs to be able to clearly see because that should drive some of our decisions if there's differences in the scores among the schools.

459
01:28:30,196 --> 01:28:31,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's important information to have.

460
01:28:31,996 --> 01:28:40,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I also think that now that we also have our new executive director of data, hopefully that position, the person in that position could help to explain.

461
01:28:40,958 --> 01:28:46,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly there's always should be explanation of the reasons behind the differences

462
01:28:46,843 --> 01:28:58,243
[SPEAKER_04]: in the scores, but I think that's information that we really need to have because an aggregate score doesn't always completely give us the full picture of whether the students are making progress.

463
01:29:02,327 --> 01:29:13,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just, if that's the will of the committee, I just would want us to be sure that we have a disclaimer knowing that some schools have different populations.

464
01:29:14,029 --> 01:29:19,350
[SPEAKER_03]: So students are maybe acquiring English at different rates.

465
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:26,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they may not perform as well as some of the other schools.

466
01:29:26,531 --> 01:29:30,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And just that that's taken into consideration, that they are making progress.

467
01:29:30,796 --> 01:29:33,137
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're just making progress at a different rate.

468
01:29:33,697 --> 01:29:44,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of our, so that was where there was reservation on my part, but, you know, that is a possibility.

469
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,701
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want everyone to be aware of that, so.

470
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:52,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

471
01:29:52,543 --> 01:29:54,063
[SPEAKER_11]: That was for that, so.

472
01:29:55,244 --> 01:29:55,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

473
01:29:57,949 --> 01:29:59,711
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a bunch of items.

474
01:29:59,911 --> 01:30:06,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm going to apologize in advance that I did not get an email to the superintendent before today but I'm happy to do that.

475
01:30:07,857 --> 01:30:10,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Um if um if she would like afterwards.

476
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:22,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Um to member Hays's point like I'm I am supportive of expecting to or being able to see how various schools are performing and of course like

477
01:30:23,402 --> 01:30:26,683
[SPEAKER_05]: we understand that there are different programs in different places, we get it.

478
01:30:28,084 --> 01:30:34,726
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think if we're talking about growth, like we would wanna be seeing growth among all of our students.

479
01:30:35,566 --> 01:30:48,131
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the other thing I would like to see is a much more like cohesive visual of how we did against the pandemic.

480
01:30:49,695 --> 01:30:59,198
[SPEAKER_05]: The goal because last year it was really difficult and I think if I can recall like I don't think we made I don't think we hit the goal.

481
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:09,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we hit it in some places and not in others, and it was incredibly difficult as somebody who is like sitting down to say, did you meet expectations, yes or no.

482
01:31:11,434 --> 01:31:27,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether you did or you didn't and I part of it was because like we've got this just big pile of information and there wasn't an agreed upon like way that we will see this information in some sort of like one page summary form that says like.

483
01:31:28,424 --> 01:31:30,625
[SPEAKER_05]: We did it or we didn't by these measures.

484
01:31:30,825 --> 01:31:33,406
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think it would be really helpful.

485
01:31:34,106 --> 01:31:50,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, before we are talking about the evaluation to come up with what that like dashboard looks like for lack of a better term so that we can all say, yeah, we agree that this point of view of the data is going to give us what we need to be able to like understand like

486
01:31:50,799 --> 01:31:53,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did we meet this goal, this literacy goal?

487
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:54,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Where did we not?

488
01:31:55,120 --> 01:31:56,961
[SPEAKER_05]: And did we in the aggregate, right?

489
01:31:56,981 --> 01:31:58,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think that's always the hard part.

490
01:31:58,722 --> 01:32:03,003
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, well, you did and you did here, you didn't there, you did here, you did here, you didn't there.

491
01:32:03,503 --> 01:32:04,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, what does that mean?

492
01:32:05,384 --> 01:32:07,804
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it would be helpful for us to agree on that upfront.

493
01:32:09,025 --> 01:32:14,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be the design of that would certainly be an outcome that I think would be very, very helpful.

494
01:32:16,357 --> 01:32:23,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Also from a literacy perspective, I guess, you know, one question that I had is like, I don't feel like we talked about dibbles last year.

495
01:32:23,301 --> 01:32:24,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I could be wrong.

496
01:32:25,062 --> 01:32:32,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but if we're saying we want 90% of students to make a 10%, um, jump, what, what did they do last year?

497
01:32:32,946 --> 01:32:36,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Did we like, is that, do we already do that?

498
01:32:36,228 --> 01:32:40,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And we should be like pushing you to do something more than 10%.

499
01:32:40,791 --> 01:32:42,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what, so what is the baseline?

500
01:32:42,752 --> 01:32:43,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, where are we starting?

501
01:32:43,913 --> 01:32:44,593
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say.

502
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:52,839
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a good sort of aggressive but realistic goal without knowing like where are we right now from a DIBLS perspective.

503
01:33:01,986 --> 01:33:11,089
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the growth for oral reading fluency for last year's data at hand right now.

504
01:33:11,349 --> 01:33:14,470
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can definitely work on getting that data to you.

505
01:33:21,752 --> 01:33:22,653
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's fine.

506
01:33:22,993 --> 01:33:25,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sort of envisioning there's like a revision of this, right?

507
01:33:25,874 --> 01:33:26,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's fine.

508
01:33:27,854 --> 01:33:29,555
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just, I more wanna know like,

509
01:33:30,799 --> 01:33:50,840
[SPEAKER_05]: We, I want you to have goals that are attainable but also like are pushing the district forward and if we're like if we're already at 90 90% 90% of students meeting 10% like that's not a push that's not a goal that's going to push us forward right if we're already if that's sort of what we have been doing all this time.

510
01:33:51,801 --> 01:34:02,207
[SPEAKER_05]: don't think you don't need to have the answer right now but I think that's the information like I would need to feel comfortable that that is a goal where we're saying we're really pushing the the needle forward here.

511
01:34:02,347 --> 01:34:06,770
[SPEAKER_05]: So, from a from a student learning goal, those, that was all my comments.

512
01:34:07,210 --> 01:34:11,853
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually had quite a number of thoughts about the district improvement goal as well.

513
01:34:11,953 --> 01:34:13,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know, mayor, if you want me to go through them.

514
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:17,936
[SPEAKER_10]: One more of your questions and then we'll.

515
01:34:17,956 --> 01:34:18,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

516
01:34:18,257 --> 01:34:18,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Move on to

517
01:34:22,107 --> 01:34:27,758
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a series of things that I think are missing from this goal, either as an action or an outcome.

518
01:34:29,378 --> 01:34:42,163
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'll try to run through them and I promise to send you an email as well, but I would like to see a commitment to a timely budget process that's thoughtful, comprehensive, and timely because we struggle with that every single year no matter what we do.

519
01:34:43,804 --> 01:34:51,407
[SPEAKER_05]: We passed a resolution a few weeks ago about an excessive heat protocol, so I would like to see that be listed as

520
01:34:51,952 --> 01:35:01,139
[SPEAKER_05]: a key action that the development of that protocol is completed and implemented and that we could see it in action if there were another excessive heat day.

521
01:35:02,621 --> 01:35:10,487
[SPEAKER_05]: We also are in the middle of looking at new schedules for the middle school or revised schedules for the middle school and the high school.

522
01:35:10,507 --> 01:35:15,691
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to be able to see that we're ready to implement those things at the start of the next school year.

523
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:21,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also like to see evidence that we have

524
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:26,363
[SPEAKER_05]: implemented the the bullying policy that we just passed.

525
01:35:27,123 --> 01:35:32,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Um because I think that policy implementation is a concern that I have just in general.

526
01:35:32,767 --> 01:35:36,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Um but that was a really big important change.

527
01:35:36,729 --> 01:35:46,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Um and I wanna I I don't have a thought off the top of my head about like how would we know it's being implemented but I think that's the question for you to

528
01:35:50,666 --> 01:35:56,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I just have a couple more things I can like move quickly because I'm going to send you an email if that's okay.

529
01:35:57,468 --> 01:36:11,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also like to see there be a specific outcome that ties to the climate study that we're going to talk about in just a minute, where we are, you know, we started talking about that last time and we talked about the data there as a baseline.

530
01:36:11,272 --> 01:36:13,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like a starting point.

531
01:36:14,093 --> 01:36:17,434
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that's a starting point, we should be able to see and observe

532
01:36:19,072 --> 01:36:21,674
[SPEAKER_05]: measurable progress based on that survey.

533
01:36:21,694 --> 01:36:34,345
[SPEAKER_05]: If we are doing the work to improve the climate and culture so I think tying to some advancement of the of that survey however you know again I don't have a specific idea of how we do it but I would love to hear what.

534
01:36:34,807 --> 01:36:37,168
[SPEAKER_05]: your team thinks about that.

535
01:36:38,109 --> 01:36:44,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to see something explicit that ties us to like a percentage of improvement in that survey.

536
01:36:44,332 --> 01:36:56,518
[SPEAKER_05]: And then two other things that are sort of on my mind, we've sort of danced around the idea that the strategic plan is expiring or done or sort of at the end of its term.

537
01:36:57,245 --> 01:37:17,229
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would like for us to at least this year have a plan for how we're gonna go forward with the strategic plan that makes the plan about engagement of lots of audiences, which did not happen last time, and is really sort of the hallmark of a strategic plan to me.

538
01:37:17,830 --> 01:37:20,210
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to see something about that.

539
01:37:21,070 --> 01:37:23,851
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last thing that I will say, and then I will stop talking,

540
01:37:24,497 --> 01:37:27,998
[SPEAKER_05]: is under number six where we talk about enhancing human resources practices.

541
01:37:28,498 --> 01:37:31,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's really critically important.

542
01:37:31,559 --> 01:37:36,380
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to add and labor relations to this bullet number six under key actions.

543
01:37:37,781 --> 01:37:48,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I am really, really concerned about the climate that we find ourselves in from a labor relations perspective with our bargaining partners.

544
01:37:49,693 --> 01:38:13,793
[SPEAKER_05]: and I would like to see us really intentionally chart a better path forward where we're operating with clarity and collaboration and just an overall feeling of teamwork and that from an HR perspective, we have good controls and procedures in place when it comes to labor relations issues and they will always happen no matter how well-functioning a district, right?

545
01:38:14,734 --> 01:38:17,636
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think from an outcomes perspective, I would like to see us,

546
01:38:19,113 --> 01:38:34,145
[SPEAKER_05]: complete and execute and implement an employee handbook and I know we've talked about that and I think there's a draft floating around but I think it is well past time for us to have an employee handbook that outlines the rules of the road for everybody who is in our employ.

547
01:38:35,206 --> 01:38:36,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's my whole list.

548
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:47,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I will send you an email with all of those things on them but those are all things that I think would add some like real meat to this and and be relevant to like what we have in front of us as a district right now.

549
01:38:50,401 --> 01:38:52,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

550
01:38:53,522 --> 01:38:53,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

551
01:38:55,183 --> 01:39:00,004
[SPEAKER_06]: I would agree with my colleagues just in terms of measurable goals and benchmarks.

552
01:39:00,104 --> 01:39:15,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that, again, knowing where we're starting and what the measure is for where we're going is really critical for us to be able to do an appropriate evaluation when the time comes to be able to say, yes, this goal was achieved and we started here and we're now here in terms of data.

553
01:39:15,189 --> 01:39:18,811
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would definitely agree with the measurable goals and benchmarks.

554
01:39:20,948 --> 01:39:32,133
[SPEAKER_06]: And specifically, thank you for taking some time to rethink that this and also to just listen to our feedback tonight to and reconsider some of it.

555
01:39:32,153 --> 01:39:39,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that, you know, it's really important to have that back and forth and continue to work together to ensure that we're able to

556
01:39:40,797 --> 01:39:48,080
[SPEAKER_06]: adequately evaluate and look at what's being done in terms of both the district and performance in general.

557
01:39:49,261 --> 01:39:58,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically for, I'm looking at, you know, as we look at safety, equity and consistency and safe and accessible are things that have been used a couple of times.

558
01:39:59,505 --> 01:40:06,528
[SPEAKER_06]: For item number one, I'm just curious about the improved physical accessibilities at school facilities and develop maintenance systems.

559
01:40:07,028 --> 01:40:08,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious about,

560
01:40:09,375 --> 01:40:14,338
[SPEAKER_06]: why physical there and not improve accessibility at school facilities?

561
01:40:14,398 --> 01:40:18,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what was the differentiation for you in terms of that?

562
01:40:18,500 --> 01:40:22,222
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll just, I have a response about one of the outcomes on that.

563
01:40:22,922 --> 01:40:29,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely can remove the word physical and just have it say increase accessibility.

564
01:40:29,966 --> 01:40:30,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

565
01:40:30,326 --> 01:40:31,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't know if there was clarity.

566
01:40:31,807 --> 01:40:31,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

567
01:40:31,987 --> 01:40:33,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't know if there was a particular reason.

568
01:40:33,888 --> 01:40:34,969
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for clarifying that.

569
01:40:35,461 --> 01:40:43,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for the outcomes, I would ask, you know, so the increasing accessibility of, you know, access, parking, pedestrian, restroom facilities.

570
01:40:43,947 --> 01:41:01,200
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's, I don't think it's just facilities in terms of, you know, some of the specifics, which at the same time, I know that we need to have these benchmarks and objectives, but I would also ask that you consider, you know, I think pedestrian covers entrances and exits, but also signage.

571
01:41:01,741 --> 01:41:06,303
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the biggest issues for a lot of the students are not knowing where to go in the building.

572
01:41:07,143 --> 01:41:12,445
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think, again, accessibility around the signage and what that looks like and how people know where they're going.

573
01:41:12,485 --> 01:41:19,188
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of that would be really helpful and be very, you know, much clearer, I think, as we're looking at that.

574
01:41:19,368 --> 01:41:24,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the, I would also concur regarding the employee handbook.

575
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:28,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that's really important as we're looking at that.

576
01:41:28,231 --> 01:41:30,392
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that just thinking about the accessibility

577
01:41:30,985 --> 01:41:32,826
[SPEAKER_06]: aspect of that in all of these ways.

578
01:41:32,906 --> 01:41:42,393
[SPEAKER_06]: So as we were talking earlier and folks were talking about the open house for the eighth graders, I was reminded of last year's open house at the high school.

579
01:41:43,594 --> 01:41:54,021
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was remembering that there was not any sort of specific accessibility for families who might be a little bit outside of the box, if you will.

580
01:41:54,601 --> 01:42:00,165
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as we're looking at all of these things, I would ask that we're thinking about how are we making things accessible overall?

581
01:42:00,646 --> 01:42:05,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I heard member Graham, you know, speak to some of that around, I think some of the language stuff.

582
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:24,923
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm also thinking around, again, the physical, but also the, you know, some of the sensory, some of the just accessibility overall, like what are we saying when we're having an open house, but we're really not opening it to all of the population if we're not making it accessible in some ways.

583
01:42:24,963 --> 01:42:27,045
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that within reason there's budgetary issues,

584
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:33,325
[SPEAKER_06]: But will there be any option for either translation or interpretation of materials?

585
01:42:35,426 --> 01:42:38,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it needed to have an ASL interpreter?

586
01:42:38,489 --> 01:42:39,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's not.

587
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:47,656
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's going to be any opportunity where it's going to be videoed or shown, are we going to make sure that we're having closed caption?

588
01:42:47,976 --> 01:42:52,420
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think just as we're thinking about all of these that we're putting accessible,

589
01:42:53,444 --> 01:42:55,826
[SPEAKER_06]: in the language for everything and thinking about how we're doing that.

590
01:42:55,886 --> 01:42:57,808
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what does that look like for an outcome?

591
01:42:58,308 --> 01:43:15,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's just, you know, when you're talking about well-documented model of communication and templates, I think you guys showed a really great example with the website and being able to show the interpretation, I mean, the translation, but being able to think about what that outreach is to make sure people know that that exists and how do they use it, right?

592
01:43:15,622 --> 01:43:19,545
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think drilling down a little bit into how we can hold

593
01:43:20,856 --> 01:43:23,197
[SPEAKER_06]: an evaluation around whether that work has been done or not.

594
01:43:23,277 --> 01:43:25,297
[SPEAKER_06]: So with specific examples around that, so.

595
01:43:25,757 --> 01:43:29,239
[SPEAKER_06]: And then any of our events that are coming up, like I know we have some great events coming up.

596
01:43:29,259 --> 01:43:31,159
[SPEAKER_06]: We have homecoming dance, right, this Friday.

597
01:43:32,179 --> 01:43:40,422
[SPEAKER_06]: And have, you know, have people then offer the opportunity to have accommodations if needed for the homecoming dance, right?

598
01:43:41,262 --> 01:43:42,722
[SPEAKER_06]: And if so, what does that look like?

599
01:43:42,903 --> 01:43:45,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And being able to understand, you know, how that happens.

600
01:43:47,144 --> 01:43:47,644
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

601
01:43:51,112 --> 01:43:52,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau, then Member Graham.

602
01:43:53,653 --> 01:43:54,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, anybody else?

603
01:43:54,993 --> 01:43:55,393
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

604
01:43:57,213 --> 01:44:02,555
[SPEAKER_17]: In the district improvement goal, everybody else has already asked a bunch of great questions already, so.

605
01:44:05,175 --> 01:44:11,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Key action number four, it's reestablish the capital planning committee to examine building systems and create a replacement timeline.

606
01:44:13,837 --> 01:44:15,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Create a replacement timeline.

607
01:44:15,097 --> 01:44:17,238
[SPEAKER_17]: Does that mean for each building?

608
01:44:17,993 --> 01:44:22,236
[SPEAKER_17]: or I'm not sure what the replacement timeline is, what does that mean?

609
01:44:23,597 --> 01:44:28,661
[SPEAKER_03]: So for some pieces of equipment that might be near their end of life.

610
01:44:29,201 --> 01:44:31,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so the individual systems.

611
01:44:31,463 --> 01:44:32,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, systems.

612
01:44:33,004 --> 01:44:46,194
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can... It is what it says, but I just wanted to be clear because we are also talking about the high school and I didn't want it to seem like this group would be discussing a timeline for replacing the high school, which would be sort of out of scope

613
01:44:47,617 --> 01:44:48,177
[SPEAKER_17]: my thoughts.

614
01:44:48,937 --> 01:44:49,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, great.

615
01:44:49,757 --> 01:44:59,239
[SPEAKER_17]: And then in outcomes, there is the communication platforms will be used regularly by all systems.

616
01:44:59,399 --> 01:45:02,820
[SPEAKER_17]: And what do you, what does student servicing groups mean?

617
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:04,840
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanna make sure, does it mean PTOs?

618
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:06,401
[SPEAKER_17]: Does it mean the clubs?

619
01:45:06,521 --> 01:45:08,801
[SPEAKER_17]: Does it, what does student servicing groups mean?

620
01:45:08,821 --> 01:45:15,643
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do, we do have, we don't have students right now using some more, but

621
01:45:19,016 --> 01:45:25,639
[SPEAKER_03]: We have principals, we have some administrators that are using this some more and the final site.

622
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:36,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything that would be communicating outwards from the district perspective, we would be having it all looped in to some more and final site.

623
01:45:36,484 --> 01:45:42,547
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the student servicing groups is just needs to be wordsmith, I can take that off and just say,

624
01:45:43,254 --> 01:45:48,677
[SPEAKER_03]: communication platforms, such as some more and final site mass notifications are used regularly by all schools.

625
01:45:49,297 --> 01:45:50,617
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that is easy.

626
01:45:50,677 --> 01:45:57,641
[SPEAKER_17]: I just don't want it to sound like we're expecting, you know, the clubs and the packs and other folks to be using this stuff.

627
01:45:57,821 --> 01:46:01,342
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it might be an interesting conversation about whether they should be.

628
01:46:01,883 --> 01:46:04,664
[SPEAKER_17]: But from a scope perspective, I just wanted to make sure that was clear.

629
01:46:05,376 --> 01:46:09,700
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I just had a couple of other questions that are sort of seem random.

630
01:46:09,780 --> 01:46:18,127
[SPEAKER_17]: But when we talk about how many more hours a day we expect you to work as an actual employee, how many emails do you receive per day on average?

631
01:46:18,167 --> 01:46:18,748
[SPEAKER_17]: Just a guess.

632
01:46:21,490 --> 01:46:22,391
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't tell you.

633
01:46:22,411 --> 01:46:22,391
100?

634
01:46:22,931 --> 01:46:24,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.

635
01:46:24,492 --> 01:46:28,896
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's only on the, I'm not even looking sometimes at the other email.

636
01:46:28,936 --> 01:46:30,117
[SPEAKER_03]: So 100 is fair.

637
01:46:31,582 --> 01:46:36,909
[SPEAKER_17]: And how many, on average, how many hours a day do you work during the school year?

638
01:46:38,491 --> 01:46:40,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my days are long.

639
01:46:40,253 --> 01:46:47,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually am a night owl, so I stay late and I continue to work at home.

640
01:46:47,933 --> 01:46:50,635
[SPEAKER_17]: different people have different ideas of what it means to work long hours.

641
01:46:51,336 --> 01:46:54,538
[SPEAKER_17]: If I have a 10 hour day, I sometimes I'm like, this day won't end.

642
01:46:55,058 --> 01:47:03,304
[SPEAKER_03]: But for other people, I mean, 16 hours, 11 o'clock, and I'll time them to go out at in the morning, like 630.

643
01:47:03,945 --> 01:47:08,768
[SPEAKER_03]: So I usually don't go down until close to midnight on average.

644
01:47:08,788 --> 01:47:09,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

645
01:47:10,469 --> 01:47:16,714
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you lose vacation days each year that you're allotted in your contract, but you can't actually figure out how to take because you're so busy?

646
01:47:17,955 --> 01:47:19,616
[SPEAKER_03]: I have and so have members of the team.

647
01:47:20,036 --> 01:47:21,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

648
01:47:21,657 --> 01:47:31,300
[SPEAKER_17]: I just, I think these are important considerations when we consider adding work to you, because I was part of the committee that hired you.

649
01:47:32,220 --> 01:47:43,785
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, there are many different views on what we people expect from a chief executive some people expect a chief executive to be shackled to their job, and not sleep.

650
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,044
[SPEAKER_17]: frankly, a lot of chief executives do that, and they're proud of it.

651
01:47:50,586 --> 01:48:01,240
[SPEAKER_17]: And Medford had a history of a superintendent who worked 12, 16 hour days, six days a week, and that worked for Medford at the time and for that superintendent.

652
01:48:01,735 --> 01:48:17,204
[SPEAKER_17]: But when we were hiring, we were very clear, I was very clear and I think the room was clear, that we were looking for somebody who had some concept of work-life balance and was actually going to be a person who could have a life outside of Medford Public Schools.

653
01:48:18,485 --> 01:48:28,451
[SPEAKER_17]: And so when I hear about you can't take the vacation that you're allotted in your contract and you don't get paid for it either, it just vanishes and you,

654
01:48:29,955 --> 01:48:35,319
[SPEAKER_17]: are working, you know, I mean, there's the whole, you know, working smarter, not harder, all that stuff.

655
01:48:35,379 --> 01:48:37,781
[SPEAKER_17]: But there are limits to working smarter and not harder.

656
01:48:38,802 --> 01:48:49,050
[SPEAKER_17]: When your boss, which is us, piles more stuff on that we expect only you to do, not to delegate, but only you to do.

657
01:48:49,070 --> 01:48:55,576
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's quite reasonable in my mind for us to keep piling work on and for you to delegate it.

658
01:48:55,836 --> 01:48:58,458
[SPEAKER_17]: But if we pile work on and we say, it is only,

659
01:48:59,278 --> 01:49:11,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Maurice Edouard-Vincent who may perform these duties, then I think it's reasonable for us to consider whether or not we're being in, you know, excessive.

660
01:49:13,054 --> 01:49:15,818
[SPEAKER_17]: And so when we talk about, you know,

661
01:49:16,557 --> 01:49:23,300
[SPEAKER_17]: I went to many PTO meetings, not many, some PTO meetings when my kids were in elementary school, the principal was always there and I thought that worked.

662
01:49:24,821 --> 01:49:29,983
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, has anybody asked principals if they want the superintendent sitting in on their meetings?

663
01:49:30,283 --> 01:49:30,703
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

664
01:49:30,723 --> 01:49:44,789
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't mean this to be anything about any specific thing tonight, but I do think that, you know, we want you here at eight o'clock in the morning and we want you here at 10 o'clock at night or nine o'clock at night.

665
01:49:45,516 --> 01:49:52,998
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just think we need to think about what we're expecting and asking of one human being.

666
01:49:53,018 --> 01:50:02,681
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, we don't put it everywhere in our policies, but we often say the superintendent will do this.

667
01:50:04,204 --> 01:50:13,851
[SPEAKER_17]: And we decided a while ago that we wouldn't every single time say, or his or her delegate, because that becomes obnoxious to see that written everywhere.

668
01:50:14,351 --> 01:50:26,720
[SPEAKER_17]: But when we are asking the superintendent to do something, most of the time, I mean, I'm expecting the superintendent to delegate that stuff, not to figure out how to find more hours in a day.

669
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:32,804
[SPEAKER_17]: And so whenever we ask for things, we're explicitly saying the superintendent is the person that must do it.

670
01:50:32,844 --> 01:50:33,765
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need to like,

671
01:50:34,875 --> 01:50:40,317
[SPEAKER_17]: get out a piece of paper and start figuring out how much are we asking only the superintendent to do.

672
01:50:41,678 --> 01:50:59,004
[SPEAKER_17]: It just concerns me greatly, because there is no time when I can't talk to you, or, and you know, you'll call me or something about like some agenda item, and you're not at home working from home you're still at the office and it's long past rush hour.

673
01:51:01,618 --> 01:51:05,159
[SPEAKER_17]: I just have a lot of concern about what this looks like.

674
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:17,164
[SPEAKER_17]: And someday if we have to hire another superintendent, they're gonna look and say, well, would you last superintendent have to, I don't want a 93 hour a week work, because guess what?

675
01:51:17,244 --> 01:51:24,847
[SPEAKER_17]: The salary sounds great to folks who see the contract, but then when you start dividing it up by the number of hours, it starts to not look so good.

676
01:51:26,307 --> 01:51:30,169
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm just deeply concerned about how many goals we are having.

677
01:51:31,559 --> 01:51:38,081
[SPEAKER_17]: if we expect those goals to be met exclusively by you personally rather than your ability to delegate them.

678
01:51:38,181 --> 01:51:40,842
[SPEAKER_17]: And that just sort of a statement about concern.

679
01:51:41,482 --> 01:51:41,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

680
01:51:43,742 --> 01:51:44,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

681
01:51:45,383 --> 01:51:48,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Hays and then Member Graham.

682
01:51:50,204 --> 01:51:55,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I just would like to briefly respond since it was my particular goal area that was commented on.

683
01:51:57,904 --> 01:52:02,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think that it's important for the superintendent herself to have two-way communication with the community.

684
01:52:02,888 --> 01:52:20,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I have also had conversations with her in the past about understanding that this may mean a trade-off with other beyond school activities that she has done in the past, attending football games, attending other sporting events.

685
01:52:20,261 --> 01:52:24,965
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely do agree that when we add something

686
01:52:26,471 --> 01:52:27,891
[SPEAKER_04]: she needs to take something else away.

687
01:52:28,972 --> 01:52:46,395
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also deliberately left, especially when I emailed her, left that kind of open-ended in terms of how she wanted to, how you, Dr. Edouard-Vincent, would like to define that two-way communication so that you can make that fit into your schedule.

688
01:52:46,795 --> 01:52:53,157
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, with the understanding that you may need to alter other things or change other,

689
01:52:54,495 --> 01:52:59,356
[SPEAKER_04]: school events that you would normally attend in order to make those two-way communication events happen.

690
01:53:00,196 --> 01:53:01,597
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just wanted to clarify that.

691
01:53:04,057 --> 01:53:06,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, member Graham.

692
01:53:07,518 --> 01:53:07,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

693
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:23,722
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I I agree that we need to be thoughtful about when we're asking for something that only the superintendent can do but I would also say that by and large, everything listed here is not something that I would

694
01:53:24,414 --> 01:53:38,077
[SPEAKER_05]: be expecting the superintendent having to personally do the vast majority of everything I talked about I think everything I talked about tonight but also everything that's on here is really a reflection of the work of the district and this is, you know, the superintendent is the

695
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:43,134
[SPEAKER_05]: leader of the district and so therefore, like sort of the district's goals have to to flow down.

696
01:53:43,154 --> 01:53:49,959
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also point out that she has a rather large team of administrators underneath her.

697
01:53:50,520 --> 01:54:05,972
[SPEAKER_05]: We hear lots of criticism actually about how large that team is in the community and I'm absolutely okay with the size of the of the support team both of the assistant superintendents and of all of our department directors and our

698
01:54:07,330 --> 01:54:26,756
[SPEAKER_05]: our our coordinators because we have a lot of work to do as a district that has not been done for a really long time and I do think, you know, that's just the reality that we have to operate in but it's, you know, it's it is not good enough to just say, well, we're behind.

699
01:54:26,836 --> 01:54:28,156
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we're going to stay behind.

700
01:54:28,896 --> 01:54:30,817
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to find some, we have to find ways

701
01:54:36,172 --> 01:54:43,035
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, growing set of challenges because our students deserve a district that isn't behind.

702
01:54:43,915 --> 01:54:54,359
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is a huge tall order, but I'm glad that the superintendent has the team that she has between the assistant superintendents and the department heads.

703
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:57,341
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of people working tirelessly.

704
01:54:57,361 --> 01:55:02,443
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, one of the hallmarks of a good leader from my perspective is that

705
01:55:03,143 --> 01:55:05,064
[SPEAKER_05]: they know how to delegate and support their team.

706
01:55:06,045 --> 01:55:32,502
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hopeful that even though this is an ambitious set of goals that the superintendent, you know, really sits and plans thoughtfully with her team to delegate and make sure that everybody is working in lockstep with what these goals really are so that it can it can provide a sort of some fast forwarding of things that have been really slow to evolve here.

707
01:55:34,328 --> 01:55:38,709
[SPEAKER_05]: and that we can implement them with some consistency and fidelity.

708
01:55:39,369 --> 01:55:39,669
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

709
01:55:43,550 --> 01:55:44,130
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, everybody.

710
01:55:44,791 --> 01:55:45,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

711
01:55:47,751 --> 01:55:53,873
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a number four report on MHS culture and climate survey from school year 2022-2023.

712
01:55:53,953 --> 01:55:55,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Maurice Edward-Vincent, superintendent.

713
01:55:56,573 --> 01:55:58,354
[SPEAKER_10]: This also was previously tabled from 10 to 2023.

714
01:56:03,721 --> 01:56:04,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to take it off the table.

715
01:56:04,922 --> 01:56:10,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to take it off the table by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hays.

716
01:56:10,910 --> 01:56:11,611
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

717
01:56:11,631 --> 01:56:12,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

718
01:56:12,652 --> 01:56:13,453
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

719
01:56:13,573 --> 01:56:15,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion is approved.

720
01:56:23,379 --> 01:56:26,542
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a slide deck that we're going to share with you.

721
01:56:26,562 --> 01:56:36,874
[SPEAKER_03]: The committee received a packet, and the packet gives a more detailed breakout.

722
01:56:37,634 --> 01:56:40,517
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the purposes of this presentation,

723
01:56:41,898 --> 01:56:54,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to go through this slide deck and present the key highlights from the Culture and Climate Survey that took place last year at the high school.

724
01:56:59,721 --> 01:57:08,583
[SPEAKER_03]: The survey questions were developed last year by Medford Public Schools and the Medford Department of Health

725
01:57:10,703 --> 01:57:18,246
[SPEAKER_03]: It was open to all of our high school students between May 18 and June 6 of this school year.

726
01:57:18,266 --> 01:57:21,728
[SPEAKER_03]: 736 students participated in the survey, just over 60% of our students.

727
01:57:21,748 --> 01:57:24,929
[SPEAKER_03]: At that time, we had 1,222 students enrolled.

728
01:57:32,392 --> 01:57:39,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Students were given designated times during their English classes to complete the survey.

729
01:57:39,136 --> 01:57:52,865
[SPEAKER_03]: The survey was also translated into five languages so that students who were English learners had the opportunity to participate in the survey in their native language.

730
01:57:53,866 --> 01:57:59,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And just I want to share that the results of this culture and climate survey are truly a snapshot.

731
01:58:00,671 --> 01:58:06,260
[SPEAKER_03]: and don't necessarily reflect what is happening right now at the high school.

732
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:30,047
[SPEAKER_03]: So during the survey, there were eight categories, cultural awareness and action, diversity and inclusion, school belonging, school climate, school engagement, school safety, student teacher relationships, and valuing of school.

733
01:58:34,312 --> 01:58:56,285
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said in my previous remarks, but I do want to preface before I go further with this presentation, that this survey was a benchmark, and we want to use the results of the survey as the beginning point so that we can measure progress and growth and use this data in a most meaningful way.

734
01:59:02,205 --> 01:59:04,447
[SPEAKER_11]: So as I mentioned, there were eight categories.

735
01:59:07,890 --> 01:59:28,887
[SPEAKER_03]: The eight categories, as we analyzed and looked carefully at the data and the responses, the areas as a school that we felt were strong areas, our strengths, were school belonging, school engagement, and valuing of schools.

736
01:59:31,943 --> 01:59:43,367
[SPEAKER_03]: The area that was varied right in the middle was cultural awareness and action, school safety, and student-teacher relationships.

737
01:59:45,548 --> 01:59:55,912
[SPEAKER_03]: The areas for growth that were identified from the survey, according to our interpretation, were diversity and inclusion and school climate.

738
02:00:00,580 --> 02:00:01,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Results by category.

739
02:00:05,365 --> 02:00:07,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Cultural awareness and action.

740
02:00:08,508 --> 02:00:09,229
[SPEAKER_03]: It was varied.

741
02:00:10,270 --> 02:00:19,320
[SPEAKER_03]: The question was, how often students learn about, discuss, and confront issues of race, ethnicity, and culture in their school?

742
02:00:21,374 --> 02:00:35,944
[SPEAKER_03]: A significant minority of respondents, our students, agreed that students at Medford High School were teased or picked on about their race or ethnicity or based upon their cultural background or religion.

743
02:00:38,186 --> 02:00:46,632
[SPEAKER_03]: An area that we identified as an area for growth fell in the category of diversity and inclusion.

744
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:58,389
[SPEAKER_03]: which talked about the level of diversity integration and fairness for students of different races, ethnicities cultures and abilities or identities, about 40%.

745
02:01:01,095 --> 02:01:19,459
[SPEAKER_03]: responded that they agreed that at Medford High School, students were teased or picked on based on their physical or intellectual disability, or based upon their real or perceived sexual orientation.

746
02:01:24,440 --> 02:01:30,141
[SPEAKER_11]: So as an action item, under diversity and inclusion,

747
02:01:34,249 --> 02:01:43,473
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medford School Committee proposed and approved the new bullying prevention and intervention plan for this school year.

748
02:01:45,554 --> 02:02:00,901
[SPEAKER_03]: So our next steps as a district, October 15th, principals reviewed our bullying plan, the revised bullying prevention and intervention plan with their staff during school-based staff meetings.

749
02:02:02,856 --> 02:02:11,903
[SPEAKER_03]: at our upcoming November 7th meeting on there will be a bullying presentation during the morning session of district wide professional development.

750
02:02:13,384 --> 02:02:28,575
[SPEAKER_03]: And later during the month of November, we will be having a parent presentation by an outside presenter who will be coming to present to our greater community.

751
02:02:30,598 --> 02:02:36,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving forward, additional results under cultural awareness.

752
02:02:40,145 --> 02:02:40,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

753
02:02:43,307 --> 02:02:47,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Under school belonging, we identified that as a strength.

754
02:02:49,091 --> 02:02:58,878
[SPEAKER_03]: How much students feel that they are valued members of the community, 90% felt that they belonged and they were accepted in the community.

755
02:03:00,358 --> 02:03:12,244
[SPEAKER_03]: It was clear for us that the majority felt that they had many chances to be part of class discussions, extracurricular activities, and school-sponsored events and activities.

756
02:03:13,504 --> 02:03:17,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Two-thirds of the students felt that they are part of the school.

757
02:03:19,467 --> 02:03:22,729
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, an area for growth was school climate.

758
02:03:24,189 --> 02:03:27,971
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the overall social and learning climate of the school.

759
02:03:30,552 --> 02:03:47,068
[SPEAKER_03]: A substantial number agreed that people of different backgrounds get along well at Medford High School and more and that was really saying about greater than 80% and more than two thirds didn't feel that students are often bullied.

760
02:03:49,355 --> 02:04:04,849
[SPEAKER_03]: An area that students clearly identified as an area for growth to support a healthy climate had to do with school bathrooms and school grounds and that they didn't feel they were sufficiently maintained last year.

761
02:04:06,892 --> 02:04:15,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were mixed results, measures related to healthy and effective conflict resolution and discipline.

762
02:04:15,738 --> 02:04:22,242
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is an area we know that we will continue to target and work on specifically.

763
02:04:23,863 --> 02:04:31,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving forward, our action items for that

764
02:04:34,838 --> 02:04:53,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Student bathrooms, including gender neutral bathrooms are available on each floor throughout this throughout the school day assistant principals and building monitors and engagement specialists conduct regular walkthroughs of the hallway common and bathroom spaces so we have.

765
02:04:54,917 --> 02:05:03,243
[SPEAKER_03]: additional structures in place where we're receiving timely feedback in order to ensure that those areas are being maintained.

766
02:05:04,043 --> 02:05:11,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Custodians are conducting regular cleaning schedules on all of our bathrooms and facilities and grounds.

767
02:05:11,768 --> 02:05:17,772
[SPEAKER_03]: They've adopted a new landscaping routine to improve the Medford High School campus.

768
02:05:20,080 --> 02:05:34,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Also Medford High, we have submitted an MSBA application for the renewal to have a new and improved high school with the desire of long-term improvements.

769
02:05:37,274 --> 02:05:38,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Page 11, please.

770
02:05:39,356 --> 02:05:46,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Under student voice, Medford High School is committed to continued events

771
02:05:49,582 --> 02:05:57,469
[SPEAKER_03]: is committed to continued efforts to build school community and expand opportunities for student voice and leadership.

772
02:05:58,449 --> 02:06:03,954
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are regular student advisory blocks with community building activities built in.

773
02:06:05,115 --> 02:06:16,404
[SPEAKER_03]: There are facilitated activities now during lunch and other opportunities for students to engage using the gymnasium.

774
02:06:18,160 --> 02:06:33,114
[SPEAKER_03]: We are building, continuing to build community through the house model and additional student feedback is going to be gathered through follow-up surveys and student group sessions.

775
02:06:35,376 --> 02:06:42,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Our assistant principals are also going to be trained on increasing student voice, opportunities for greater student voice.

776
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:47,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Page 12.

777
02:06:47,842 --> 02:06:55,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Another area of strength was school engagement, student attentiveness and investments in the school.

778
02:06:57,015 --> 02:07:02,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Nearly all respondents indicated that there were positive measures on school engagement.

779
02:07:04,225 --> 02:07:10,250
[SPEAKER_03]: 88% agreed that a teacher or another adult at school would notice their absence.

780
02:07:11,031 --> 02:07:17,556
[SPEAKER_03]: And 90% felt that they have the opportunity to participate in class discussions or activities.

781
02:07:18,637 --> 02:07:26,864
[SPEAKER_03]: And 93% reported that there are many opportunities for student involvement in activities outside of the classroom.

782
02:07:27,425 --> 02:07:29,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that was a great area of strength.

783
02:07:31,138 --> 02:07:36,441
[SPEAKER_03]: varied, again, student physical and psychological safety within the school.

784
02:07:38,462 --> 02:07:56,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we did have 60% of students agree that they feel safe at school, but many also felt that students at the school regularly fight, steal, or use substances such as drugs or alcohol at school.

785
02:07:59,128 --> 02:08:10,112
[SPEAKER_03]: 80% of respondents said that there is a teacher or some other adult who students can go to if they need help because of sexual assault or dating violence.

786
02:08:10,392 --> 02:08:18,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So they do feel that there is a trusted adult who would be able to provide support in the event of those situations.

787
02:08:20,895 --> 02:08:26,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Under student-teacher relationships, that was identified as an area that was varied.

788
02:08:28,891 --> 02:08:34,838
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the strength of social connections between students and teachers within and beyond the school.

789
02:08:34,858 --> 02:08:43,248
[SPEAKER_03]: 70% felt that they had strong social connections with their teachers within and beyond the school.

790
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:48,595
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of them felt that their teachers cared about them.

791
02:08:51,055 --> 02:09:03,541
[SPEAKER_03]: However, at the same time, there was a minority of 45% of respondents that felt adults working at the school did not treat all students with respect.

792
02:09:04,241 --> 02:09:09,524
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that is something where we are working on all of that together.

793
02:09:09,544 --> 02:09:14,266
[SPEAKER_03]: And we identified that as varied because there were different results.

794
02:09:15,927 --> 02:09:18,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Another area that was identified as a strength

795
02:09:20,117 --> 02:09:27,030
[SPEAKER_03]: was valuing a school, how much do students feel that school is interesting, important, and useful?

796
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:37,475
[SPEAKER_03]: 55% of the students indicated that the things they're learning in school are important to them and connected to life outside of the school.

797
02:09:38,156 --> 02:09:43,498
[SPEAKER_03]: And 90% responded that their teachers expect them to do their best.

798
02:09:45,039 --> 02:09:53,102
[SPEAKER_03]: And 73% felt that they could talk to a teacher or adult at the school about something that was bothering them.

799
02:10:01,061 --> 02:10:12,371
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we opened, I showed this screen, and again, the areas that we identified as clear strengths were school belonging, school engagement, and valuing of school.

800
02:10:13,852 --> 02:10:20,978
[SPEAKER_03]: The areas that were varied were cultural awareness and action, school safety, and student-teacher relationships.

801
02:10:21,799 --> 02:10:26,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And the areas for growth were diversity and inclusion and school climate.

802
02:10:29,016 --> 02:10:40,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I say once again that this survey was given at the end of last school year, and that we are looking at this data as a benchmark, and not a report card.

803
02:10:41,664 --> 02:10:48,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Our intention is to continue with the reforms that have taken place thus far.

804
02:10:49,369 --> 02:11:00,892
[SPEAKER_03]: remedies and improvements that are clearly underway at the high school to lead to more favorable responses in the future culture and climate surveys that will be given this year.

805
02:11:02,313 --> 02:11:02,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

806
02:11:05,493 --> 02:11:06,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Woodson.

807
02:11:07,394 --> 02:11:08,794
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any questions from the committee?

808
02:11:09,234 --> 02:11:09,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin?

809
02:11:11,055 --> 02:11:11,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

810
02:11:14,196 --> 02:11:15,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for going through this.

811
02:11:15,546 --> 02:11:28,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a couple of questions specific to the, or comments then, I guess, questions specific to some of the outliers in terms of DEI and climate overall.

812
02:11:30,735 --> 02:11:35,758
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that you said that there was a survey, you know, that at some point should be a follow-up.

813
02:11:35,879 --> 02:11:41,322
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would ask that in a follow-up, I know that we have our director of data here tonight as well,

814
02:11:41,909 --> 02:12:00,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I would ask that in a follow up for the background questions, we include a question on whether the student is an English learner, a student with a disability, or economically disadvantaged, so that we're getting an idea of who, you know, we're breaking, disaggregating that data as well.

815
02:12:02,382 --> 02:12:07,565
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be feedback that I would respectfully ask be included in a future

816
02:12:08,717 --> 02:12:12,039
[SPEAKER_06]: demographic, and then especially around some of the questions.

817
02:12:12,559 --> 02:12:15,961
[SPEAKER_06]: So around the diversity and inclusion, two things, well, a few things.

818
02:12:16,081 --> 02:12:24,046
[SPEAKER_06]: One is, so students, it's obviously sad and upsetting to read some of this.

819
02:12:25,127 --> 02:12:32,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Students at the school are teased or picked on about their physical or intellectual disability or real or perceived sexual orientation.

820
02:12:33,271 --> 02:12:37,454
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that the students are answering honestly in this, and I also,

821
02:12:38,072 --> 02:12:40,733
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, find it very upsetting and disturbing.

822
02:12:42,113 --> 02:12:53,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a couple of questions about that one is, I'm wondering what what happened or if it still exists, the DEI committee that was created, I forget we had a different name for it.

823
02:12:54,055 --> 02:12:57,116
[SPEAKER_06]: But I can't remember the name off the top of my head right now.

824
02:12:58,376 --> 02:13:02,537
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that a number of community members and a number of faculty members were part of that is that

825
02:13:03,513 --> 02:13:04,595
[SPEAKER_06]: happening not happening.

826
02:13:05,055 --> 02:13:10,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the rate the race equity task force, and we have not reconvene this year.

827
02:13:11,786 --> 02:13:19,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to select new students, and, but we have not started this year yet, the race equity task force.

828
02:13:20,597 --> 02:13:25,098
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time this data is being presented to the committee first.

829
02:13:26,118 --> 02:13:32,240
[SPEAKER_03]: We have not shared it with staff or the greater community yet.

830
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:33,960
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to present the data here.

831
02:13:33,980 --> 02:13:44,222
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, even as we looked at all of the categories, you take the information,

832
02:13:46,297 --> 02:13:54,701
[SPEAKER_03]: where the pluses were, where the deltas were, and where there were mixed results, and look at that and say, okay, where are we going to improve?

833
02:13:55,721 --> 02:13:57,242
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, where were the low-hanging fruit?

834
02:13:57,322 --> 02:13:58,503
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the low-hanging fruit?

835
02:13:58,583 --> 02:14:00,283
[SPEAKER_03]: What few things could we do immediately?

836
02:14:02,104 --> 02:14:11,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Where some of the areas where we had some of the really low marks, we were able to put some changes in right away to start tackling those areas.

837
02:14:12,689 --> 02:14:31,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some of these areas which are more complex, working collaboratively, you know, using our advisory blocks and other opportunities where students are together to be able to have conversations with our students.

838
02:14:32,024 --> 02:14:35,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you don't know until you get the data.

839
02:14:35,267 --> 02:14:40,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you have the data, you say, okay, how are we going to use this to inform our next steps?

840
02:14:43,953 --> 02:14:55,795
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we realize that this was a snapshot in time, but we also realize like we still have work to do, but we need to share it with the other stakeholders as well.

841
02:14:56,215 --> 02:15:06,517
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can look at it and unpack the data for themselves and see the responses of the students and then, you know, go forward with that.

842
02:15:07,037 --> 02:15:12,498
[SPEAKER_06]: So is it safe to venture then that the race equity task forces is happening?

843
02:15:12,518 --> 02:15:12,838
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just

844
02:15:13,430 --> 02:15:17,992
[SPEAKER_06]: need some addressing in terms of its components?

845
02:15:18,152 --> 02:15:18,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

846
02:15:18,913 --> 02:15:19,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

847
02:15:19,913 --> 02:15:22,315
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

848
02:15:22,335 --> 02:15:24,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me give that some thought because I want to think about that for a minute.

849
02:15:24,616 --> 02:15:42,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Then also, I know that specifically our CPAC, who presented to us at the last presentation, has been making recommendations and we voted, I think, over a year ago for a disability awareness curriculum, especially if we're talking about teasing of intellectual and physical

850
02:15:42,998 --> 02:15:43,578
[SPEAKER_06]: disability.

851
02:15:44,319 --> 02:15:59,405
[SPEAKER_06]: So we said that we would have a disability awareness curriculum, we did have, and, you know, we have asked that the DEI subcommittee get together and identify specifically, you know, some ideas for the curriculum which we're working on scheduling that at this point but

852
02:15:59,918 --> 02:16:08,564
[SPEAKER_06]: even the disability awareness programming that currently exists that was offered for professional development is being offered sort of as an optional.

853
02:16:08,685 --> 02:16:24,696
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we said, we went from, I think that went from roughly 40 attendees last year and the year prior between, you know, over 40, I think the year prior to eight this year, which is substantive, especially if we're talking about this is the kind of thing that we're seeing in our schools.

854
02:16:25,277 --> 02:16:28,139
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like us to think about how

855
02:16:29,005 --> 02:16:38,691
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, that's changing and what we can be doing moving forward with some very specific action items around that disability awareness piece as well.

856
02:16:39,211 --> 02:16:46,896
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we have an agenda item that we'll talk about in a little bit about the racial, I mean, the gender identity item.

857
02:16:46,956 --> 02:16:47,556
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

858
02:16:50,838 --> 02:16:51,859
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham, Member Hays.

859
02:16:54,196 --> 02:16:54,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

860
02:16:54,637 --> 02:17:00,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that there is a category that's missing from this page.

861
02:17:01,606 --> 02:17:08,996
[SPEAKER_05]: I went through and I, there's a category of questions in the survey called sense of belonging and it doesn't

862
02:17:09,793 --> 02:17:17,738
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't appeared under strengths buried or areas of growth, and it is different than school belonging, because I toggled back and forth to make sure that I understood.

863
02:17:17,758 --> 02:17:27,944
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of really good, interesting information in here, but it is missing what I would envision to be some sort of summary and guidance around what is favorable,

864
02:17:33,520 --> 02:17:38,602
[SPEAKER_05]: how did students answer each of these questions in a favorable way, and what is that number?

865
02:17:38,622 --> 02:17:50,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know we had some discussion about that in the last meeting, and I see that the favorability number has just been removed from this report, which I actually think makes it harder to digest the information.

866
02:17:50,627 --> 02:18:02,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's important that we get it right in terms of what we talk about as favorable, so that when these questions are written in a positive manner, favorable is agree and strongly agree.

867
02:18:03,621 --> 02:18:09,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they're written negatively, like Ben, the favorable numbers are the disagree and the strongly disagree.

868
02:18:09,023 --> 02:18:23,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know to the extent that we can change the structure of the questions, whether that's an option, but it's, we're sort of tricking people, taking these things when we have like two scale, like competing scales like that.

869
02:18:23,369 --> 02:18:32,172
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think from a survey administration perspective, if we have the opportunity to sort of right size the questions so that they all

870
02:18:32,742 --> 02:18:36,204
[SPEAKER_05]: point in the same direction, I think that would be very helpful.

871
02:18:37,525 --> 02:18:54,777
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also think it would be helpful for there to be like a one page summary of what is the list of questions in each of these categories and what was our ranking so that we can easily look somewhere without having to sort of dig through many, many pages and say, did we do better this year?

872
02:18:55,797 --> 02:19:01,521
[SPEAKER_05]: There were some like really stark examples, both positive and negative.

873
02:19:03,223 --> 02:19:10,528
[SPEAKER_05]: that I think just bear commentary.

874
02:19:10,708 --> 02:19:18,593
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a question about feeling like there are teachers who

875
02:19:20,643 --> 02:19:24,124
[SPEAKER_05]: can connect what I'm learning to life outside the classroom.

876
02:19:24,164 --> 02:19:30,467
[SPEAKER_05]: There's comments, really favorable positive comments about teachers would know if I wasn't here.

877
02:19:31,847 --> 02:19:35,169
[SPEAKER_05]: But then there are some very particular questions about bullying.

878
02:19:35,569 --> 02:19:43,852
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to the point of like quantifying and evaluation, like there are really particular questions about bullying and those results are not as favorable in here.

879
02:19:44,373 --> 02:19:50,455
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think the one that like made me the saddest for lots of reasons is that

880
02:19:51,004 --> 02:19:56,748
[SPEAKER_05]: When we ask students the question, I think that students are proud of how the school looks on the outside.

881
02:19:57,428 --> 02:20:01,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Only 14% of students agreed, and I get it.

882
02:20:02,852 --> 02:20:20,003
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think when we look at the questions around the way that we maintain our buildings, the students' voices are very clear that they want and expect more from us as a district than we're providing them right now.

883
02:20:21,006 --> 02:20:46,914
[SPEAKER_05]: the the there's a number of questions here and so I think this report is really like meaty and informative and very helpful but I think for the community to be able to sort of digest it all, it needs to be presented a bit differently than this so that it can guide people in understanding sort of in a consistent way what the what the results were and and frankly that we can sort of set a measure and say, we're going to do better next year and then we

884
02:20:50,762 --> 02:21:05,915
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this was really informative and I know there's lots of people picking at various components of this from an implementation perspective and we have leadership and I'm really excited about all the energy that's going on at the high school.

885
02:21:06,415 --> 02:21:11,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's all really good and we'll tell a really great story at the end of this year.

886
02:21:11,500 --> 02:21:16,004
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think at baseline, there's work to do on this report so that it can,

887
02:21:17,186 --> 02:21:20,108
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of be a grounding place for us to start from.

888
02:21:20,128 --> 02:21:25,131
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think the support is quite there yet, but I think it's pretty close.

889
02:21:25,711 --> 02:21:26,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

890
02:21:29,714 --> 02:21:32,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Hays, then Member Ruseau.

891
02:21:34,137 --> 02:21:34,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

892
02:21:34,697 --> 02:21:35,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a few questions.

893
02:21:36,718 --> 02:21:41,061
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I am wondering about what the plan is for when the next survey will happen.

894
02:21:41,641 --> 02:21:45,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And along those lines too, I think that we had talked about

895
02:21:46,641 --> 02:22:08,155
[SPEAKER_04]: at some point, whether to use this exact same survey again, or to go with the, I guess my understanding was in terms of using Panorama, where we had originally planned to use their survey as designed, as many of the systems around us do, I'm curious whether that it will be, what we'll be using in the future.

896
02:22:08,536 --> 02:22:13,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we know what the timing of the next survey will be?

897
02:22:13,559 --> 02:22:14,920
[SPEAKER_04]: And do we know what form it will be?

898
02:22:16,135 --> 02:22:28,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they're thinking about somewhere around the halfway point in the new year to potentially do another check in with the students to see where now that they've been in school for a full semester.

899
02:22:28,920 --> 02:22:32,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, I cannot say the specific date for the next survey administration.

900
02:22:33,502 --> 02:22:36,764
[SPEAKER_03]: And even with taking this data.

901
02:22:39,332 --> 02:22:47,280
[SPEAKER_03]: You know when when we started to present last week and it's a very valid point, depending on which question was being asked.

902
02:22:48,961 --> 02:22:53,746
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it was confusing was it favorable or unfavorable so.

903
02:22:55,307 --> 02:23:02,354
[SPEAKER_03]: If we give it exactly the same way, as it is, then we could just be comparing apples and apples if we do.

904
02:23:03,163 --> 02:23:09,447
[SPEAKER_03]: make the adjustments, then it's going to be different information.

905
02:23:09,547 --> 02:23:23,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if the questions could be asked in a different way, but so that's something that I would definitely have to bring back to the team to just see do we give the exact same questions as is and just see how they respond.

906
02:23:23,634 --> 02:23:26,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we'd have two sets of numbers that are

907
02:23:27,785 --> 02:23:34,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though the favorable and unfavorable is confusing, it would be the same exact way it was given the first time.

908
02:23:34,688 --> 02:23:35,788
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

909
02:23:36,189 --> 02:23:39,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'd like to, obviously, I will no longer be a part of the committee at that point.

910
02:23:40,030 --> 02:23:52,996
[SPEAKER_04]: I would personally, at this point, like to advocate for using, and I think it had been said at one of our last meeting, one of our meetings at the end of the year when this was first presented, that we were going to be using the panoramic survey.

911
02:23:54,690 --> 02:24:06,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to quickly say again that I, you know, in looking at their survey, how it was designed, why it was designed the way it was, all the vetting that went into it, the reliability, validity, it did all of that.

912
02:24:06,874 --> 02:24:12,415
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it's a really well-designed, thoughtful survey.

913
02:24:12,855 --> 02:24:22,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not as convinced, honestly, the way these questions, part of it is the design of the questions and the design of the way students answer on this particular survey that

914
02:24:23,519 --> 02:24:32,585
[SPEAKER_04]: According to the research done by panorama is actually not an effective way of getting a full picture of how students are really feeling.

915
02:24:34,346 --> 02:24:44,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess, I also had a couple of questions, so I was thinking in terms of we keep talking about this is just being a snapshot and absolutely.

916
02:24:44,719 --> 02:24:47,842
[SPEAKER_04]: any survey is just a snapshot of that moment in time.

917
02:24:47,862 --> 02:24:56,929
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we talk a lot when we look at curriculum and assessments about triangulating data and using different assessments and pulling them together.

918
02:24:57,449 --> 02:25:08,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering and hoping that maybe our data director, who's been referenced a lot, we do have a climate report that we had from Mr. Welch, Michael Welch,

919
02:25:08,953 --> 02:25:11,373
[SPEAKER_04]: that looked at some of these kinds of issues.

920
02:25:11,513 --> 02:25:13,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously it was done in a different way.

921
02:25:14,434 --> 02:25:26,696
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have obviously data about referrals and incidents in terms of when we look at students saying that they still feel like there's a lot of fighting and violence.

922
02:25:27,376 --> 02:25:37,738
[SPEAKER_04]: We have now that comprehensive report that was done by DESE that has some, again, it's not all exact information, but I think that

923
02:25:38,365 --> 02:25:53,831
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a way, hopefully, or at least our data director can look and see if there is a way to pull some of that information together and see, get maybe a clearer picture so we're not just going with one survey, which is true, that's just one snapshot.

924
02:25:54,151 --> 02:26:03,314
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have other information to use that I think would be helpful in getting a clearer and wider picture of what's really going on for our students at the high school.

925
02:26:06,011 --> 02:26:18,340
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing that I noticed in terms of, and this is myself creating my own category, but there were a lot of questions in the various areas that really look at students' self-regulation and emotional regulation.

926
02:26:19,341 --> 02:26:35,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these questions about conflict, fighting, it's a lot of, a lot of that gets at that self-regulation, and that's clearly an issue that's been identified over and over again in research as being a problematic area post-pandemic.

927
02:26:35,728 --> 02:26:41,572
[SPEAKER_04]: that students are really having issues across the board at all ages with those self-regulation skills.

928
02:26:41,932 --> 02:26:49,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would think it would be good to hear at some point, what are we doing to work on some of that?

929
02:26:50,638 --> 02:26:58,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's really important when you look at questions about students at this school stop and think before doing anything when they get angry.

930
02:27:00,545 --> 02:27:02,707
[SPEAKER_04]: And only 20% felt that that was true.

931
02:27:06,269 --> 02:27:09,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Students try to work out their disagreements with other students by talking to them.

932
02:27:10,231 --> 02:27:12,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Only 27% felt that was true.

933
02:27:12,392 --> 02:27:14,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are really getting at that self-regulation.

934
02:27:14,894 --> 02:27:19,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Do students stop themselves before they move to physical, before they move to fighting?

935
02:27:20,077 --> 02:27:33,144
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought a lot of that information really was very interesting to see in terms of, again, that's an area that's been identified across the board as an area of difficulty post-pandemic for kids.

936
02:27:34,837 --> 02:27:47,090
[SPEAKER_04]: last question was just in reference to that the racial equity task force, can you tell us last year, how was that group working, how many times did they meet and did they what kinds of issues were they focusing on.

937
02:27:49,275 --> 02:28:00,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Attendance last year, once we were dealing with the situation at the high school, we kind of went into a different mode.

938
02:28:00,618 --> 02:28:02,358
[SPEAKER_03]: We had fluctuating attendance.

939
02:28:02,939 --> 02:28:06,980
[SPEAKER_03]: We were meeting by Zoom on Mondays.

940
02:28:07,740 --> 02:28:11,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes we would have some students attend.

941
02:28:12,581 --> 02:28:21,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it didn't work out with their schedules so there was a lot of scheduling challenges.

942
02:28:21,684 --> 02:28:24,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes people's work schedule didn't always work out.

943
02:28:25,465 --> 02:28:26,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I want to.

944
02:28:27,706 --> 02:28:40,455
[SPEAKER_03]: reach out to the families or the parents and caregivers that originally said they want to be able they want to continue to be part of the equity task force and see how many people we end up with.

945
02:28:41,216 --> 02:28:45,719
[SPEAKER_03]: And then do we need to open it up to others.

946
02:28:46,579 --> 02:28:49,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can have a manageable number.

947
02:28:51,243 --> 02:28:53,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And we talked about different, different topics.

948
02:28:55,005 --> 02:28:55,546
[SPEAKER_03]: This data

949
02:28:58,010 --> 02:29:00,671
[SPEAKER_03]: again, is new information that we didn't have before.

950
02:29:01,072 --> 02:29:20,561
[SPEAKER_03]: So this definitely would have been data that would have been shared with the Race Equity Task Force to have a conversation with them as thought partners and be able to say this is some of the data that students are saying and, you know, get feedback and suggestions from them as well.

951
02:29:21,802 --> 02:29:22,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

952
02:29:25,664 --> 02:29:25,944
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

953
02:29:25,984 --> 02:29:26,444
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

954
02:29:27,056 --> 02:29:27,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

955
02:29:27,817 --> 02:29:34,321
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to agree vehemently with member Hays on the survey.

956
02:29:34,621 --> 02:29:49,692
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, when I read the results, you know, just going to pick an example here, about 40% of respondents agreed that students at the high school were teased or picked on about their physical or intellectual disability.

957
02:29:50,802 --> 02:29:56,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody agrees the right percentage is zero, we would love to see that no student thinks that that happens.

958
02:29:57,799 --> 02:29:59,102
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I would want to know.

959
02:29:59,978 --> 02:30:12,762
[SPEAKER_17]: in figuring out where to focus a limited amount of resources and time is, how does that compare to other school systems with other high school people in it?

960
02:30:13,963 --> 02:30:19,104
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I don't like this 40%, but if you told me that the average high school it was 70%, I would be like,

961
02:30:22,500 --> 02:30:24,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's kind of very disturbing.

962
02:30:25,761 --> 02:30:32,924
[SPEAKER_17]: But I would also then say, is this the right place to first focus, considering that we can't focus on everything at once?

963
02:30:34,465 --> 02:30:43,628
[SPEAKER_17]: And there are other kinds of questions, for instance, where if 10% of students said something, it might cause everybody to panic and be like, that should be a 1%.

964
02:30:45,069 --> 02:30:53,976
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, so 10%, 40%, 2%, those things don't really mean anything without any context of what is it like in a typical high school?

965
02:30:54,557 --> 02:31:07,087
[SPEAKER_17]: We can all agree that we want these, you know, 0% of our students to believe that this kind of thing, like picking on somebody because of their physical intellectual disability, there's no question what the right number is, zero.

966
02:31:08,629 --> 02:31:12,672
[SPEAKER_17]: But if the average high school has 70% in our area,

967
02:31:14,454 --> 02:31:15,375
[SPEAKER_17]: which would be horrible.

968
02:31:17,037 --> 02:31:29,550
[SPEAKER_17]: But we had another area where it was 10% 10% of our students said something is happening, but in a typical high school it's one or 2%, like, without that information.

969
02:31:30,134 --> 02:31:34,480
[SPEAKER_17]: All we have to go on is our own sense of, we agree, this is bad.

970
02:31:35,441 --> 02:31:36,402
[SPEAKER_17]: We should focus on this.

971
02:31:37,724 --> 02:31:46,555
[SPEAKER_17]: But we don't, we can go through all of these questions and we can, without any question, there's gonna be no disagreement here that 40% should be 0% on this question.

972
02:31:48,570 --> 02:31:51,272
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, 10% should be 80% on this question.

973
02:31:51,292 --> 02:32:16,129
[SPEAKER_17]: Like there's not gonna be any question, but whether or not, which of these areas actually require our focus when there's only so much focus to give, without the other districts, the common survey that is used elsewhere to compare, I do feel like we're comparing to ourselves, which is fine.

974
02:32:17,590 --> 02:32:36,067
[SPEAKER_17]: But there's only so many hours in a day and I just do feel like that that that is missing from this, regardless of this, the design of the guesses in the know that you know the strongly agrees and strongly disagrees, even if all that wasn't a problem without the same questions being comparable to other districts.

975
02:32:37,448 --> 02:32:39,350
[SPEAKER_17]: It feels very challenging to know which

976
02:32:40,296 --> 02:32:44,140
[SPEAKER_17]: is the most important thing to focus on, but obviously not one thing.

977
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:49,985
[SPEAKER_17]: But of the many things to focus on, which ones are a higher priority?

978
02:32:52,628 --> 02:33:00,476
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just don't think we can get that unless we do go with the standardized survey that other people use.

979
02:33:00,876 --> 02:33:01,196
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

980
02:33:03,458 --> 02:33:04,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

981
02:33:04,259 --> 02:33:04,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin?

982
02:33:06,273 --> 02:33:15,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that I wanna weigh in on some of that just in terms of, yeah, I think the survey, two things, I think we're having two conversations.

983
02:33:15,599 --> 02:33:25,045
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're having another survey and we wanna compare it to the base data that we have now, we need to compare apples to apples in terms of a survey, just in terms of statistics and data.

984
02:33:25,546 --> 02:33:33,831
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if we think that the survey that we're talking about, the panoramic survey is actually much more expansive

985
02:33:34,167 --> 02:33:46,855
[SPEAKER_06]: and at the same time, much more detailed, then there's a different conversation about, okay, maybe we need the panoramic survey, we do that, and then we have a comparison to that as apples to apples for next year.

986
02:33:47,196 --> 02:33:58,183
[SPEAKER_06]: So this year we do the panoramic survey and then apples to apples for next year, because the panoramic survey, if it's being used by other districts, then we compare, we have some basis of comparison.

987
02:33:58,723 --> 02:34:02,826
[SPEAKER_06]: This homemade, if you will, survey,

988
02:34:03,757 --> 02:34:10,542
[SPEAKER_06]: for our district only is not going to offer any basis of comparison to another district because it's for this district only.

989
02:34:11,142 --> 02:34:30,216
[SPEAKER_06]: That said, there are outliers in this data and the outliers to me are the, you know, certainly about the, you know, the student being able to have some discussion around, you know, their needs and what have you, but, you know, the two of the bigger outliers to me and clearly to the data

990
02:34:30,760 --> 02:34:36,363
[SPEAKER_06]: are on the, you know, students in this school are teased or picked on about their real or perceived sexual orientation.

991
02:34:36,383 --> 02:34:40,925
[SPEAKER_06]: 32% agree with that, 50% don't.

992
02:34:41,685 --> 02:34:45,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Students at the school are teased or picked on about their physical or intellectual disability.

993
02:34:45,047 --> 02:34:48,389
[SPEAKER_06]: 34% agree about that, 44% don't.

994
02:34:49,309 --> 02:34:59,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And so these are things that are, you know, even in the standard sort of data set at our school, I agree, we want those to be 40%, but clearly in an overall aggregate picture,

995
02:34:59,827 --> 02:35:16,131
[SPEAKER_06]: we can see that we have some cultural and climate issues around competency, cultural competency, frankly, both in terms of ableism and sexism and other isms, I'm sure.

996
02:35:17,251 --> 02:35:24,473
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that that clearly shows us that there's a focus, but I guess that said, the real question here is what are we looking for?

997
02:35:24,573 --> 02:35:28,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we looking to use base data here and have a comparison

998
02:35:29,244 --> 02:35:36,609
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, mid-year or are we looking to let's have a standard that other districts are using in the state?

999
02:35:36,669 --> 02:35:38,811
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's the difference between the question.

1000
02:35:38,911 --> 02:35:49,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if that's an agenda item for next time or if there needs to be a motion for that or what, but I think we're trying to answer two different questions in terms of data.

1001
02:35:49,499 --> 02:35:52,221
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we have to be very clear about what it is we want.

1002
02:35:58,263 --> 02:36:19,296
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess to that end, I would make a motion for us to use a panoramic survey as a standard survey for the one coming out in, if it's, you know, at the end of January or what have you, and we'll do our best to make some comparison to this, but with the idea that the following year we'll use the same survey, so.

1003
02:36:27,602 --> 02:36:27,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1004
02:36:27,962 --> 02:36:31,044
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could take a roll call vote, please.

1005
02:36:31,064 --> 02:36:31,624
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1006
02:36:32,165 --> 02:36:32,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham?

1007
02:36:34,826 --> 02:36:35,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1008
02:36:36,087 --> 02:36:36,727
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Hays?

1009
02:36:36,927 --> 02:36:37,147
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1010
02:36:39,008 --> 02:36:39,228
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1011
02:36:41,310 --> 02:36:41,910
[SPEAKER_16]: Member McLaughlin?

1012
02:36:42,310 --> 02:36:42,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1013
02:36:43,451 --> 02:36:44,071
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Rostow?

1014
02:36:44,191 --> 02:36:44,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1015
02:36:44,772 --> 02:36:45,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau?

1016
02:36:45,332 --> 02:36:45,552
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1017
02:36:45,612 --> 02:36:46,272
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

1018
02:36:46,633 --> 02:36:47,933
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to abstain from this one.

1019
02:36:47,993 --> 02:36:50,735
[SPEAKER_10]: So six in the affirmative, one abstains, motion passes.

1020
02:36:53,102 --> 02:37:03,856
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a recommendation to approve $10,000 donation by the Cummings Foundation to the Center for citizenship citizenship and social responsibility CCSR Dr. Maurice Edouard-Vincent.

1021
02:37:06,500 --> 02:37:08,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Just requesting approval from the committee for the 10,000.

1022
02:37:08,902 --> 02:37:18,289
[SPEAKER_03]: The implementation plan is going to be developed by assistant superintendent Lucy and our coordinator Suzanne fee.

1023
02:37:19,630 --> 02:37:23,152
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is expected that the plan will be completed in the very near future.

1024
02:37:23,813 --> 02:37:32,299
[SPEAKER_03]: So my recommendation is that the school committee approved this generous and appreciated donation to the Medford public schools for CCSR.

1025
02:37:32,827 --> 02:37:37,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1026
02:37:37,811 --> 02:37:38,652
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1027
02:37:38,672 --> 02:37:39,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1028
02:37:39,432 --> 02:37:40,513
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1029
02:37:40,613 --> 02:37:42,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to the Cummings Foundation.

1030
02:37:42,255 --> 02:37:44,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion is approved.

1031
02:37:44,516 --> 02:37:45,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Donation is accepted.

1032
02:37:46,338 --> 02:37:50,701
[SPEAKER_10]: We have number six, MCAS and MCAS alternate report.

1033
02:37:50,882 --> 02:37:58,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Suzanne E. Galussi, Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction, Ms.

1034
02:37:58,888 --> 02:38:01,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Joan Bowen, who's the Director of Student Services.

1035
02:38:21,148 --> 02:38:24,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, there you go.

1036
02:38:24,830 --> 02:38:26,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there we go.

1037
02:38:28,872 --> 02:38:34,054
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the School Committee and Superintendent Edouard-Vincent.

1038
02:38:34,754 --> 02:38:38,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight I'm joined by quite a team.

1039
02:38:39,276 --> 02:38:45,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Joan Bowen, Director of Student Services, Dr. Bernadette Riccidelli,

1040
02:38:45,697 --> 02:38:49,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Director of Professional Learning and Student Assessment.

1041
02:38:49,719 --> 02:38:52,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul DeLeva, Executive Director of Data and Reporting.

1042
02:38:53,481 --> 02:38:56,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities.

1043
02:38:57,303 --> 02:38:59,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Faiza Khan, Director of Mathematics.

1044
02:38:59,584 --> 02:39:02,085
[SPEAKER_09]: And Rocco Sieri, Director of Science.

1045
02:39:02,625 --> 02:39:08,208
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are going to present the 2023 Accountability and MCAS results.

1046
02:39:09,689 --> 02:39:13,731
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, the team will take you through a detailed presentation of the district's MCAS scores,

1047
02:39:14,218 --> 02:39:18,162
[SPEAKER_09]: highlights, areas of growth, and any challenges that we faced.

1048
02:39:19,082 --> 02:39:27,490
[SPEAKER_09]: It is our goal this evening to provide you with information on the accountability, MCAS scoring, performance growth, and our instructional priorities for this school year.

1049
02:39:28,751 --> 02:39:32,934
[SPEAKER_09]: At this time, I'm going to pass it to Dr. Riccadeli and Paul DeLeva.

1050
02:39:33,155 --> 02:39:33,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1051
02:39:44,448 --> 02:39:44,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

1052
02:39:47,811 --> 02:39:48,372
[SPEAKER_20]: So as Ms.

1053
02:39:48,412 --> 02:39:55,758
[SPEAKER_20]: Galussi said, we are going to provide information tonight on the district's accountability and MCAS results.

1054
02:39:56,559 --> 02:40:00,223
[SPEAKER_20]: So moving forward, we skip right over the agenda.

1055
02:40:03,205 --> 02:40:09,031
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so actually, Dr. Cushing, can you go back one to the accountability?

1056
02:40:09,211 --> 02:40:10,372
[SPEAKER_20]: Just thank you very much.

1057
02:40:10,913 --> 02:40:29,286
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so the purpose of the accountability, as you probably know, but for those that don't know, is to provide a clear, actionable information, excuse me, to provide clear, actionable information to families, community members, and the public about district and school performance.

1058
02:40:29,926 --> 02:40:34,009
[SPEAKER_20]: The framework for the accountability system allows DESE to identify

1059
02:40:34,554 --> 02:40:37,876
[SPEAKER_20]: districts and schools that require assistance and intervention.

1060
02:40:38,357 --> 02:40:46,122
[SPEAKER_20]: So the reports are pretty sophisticated, pretty complicated, loaded with statistics and numbers.

1061
02:40:46,602 --> 02:40:59,591
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think what DESE has done and what we're gonna provide you tonight is in a snapshot, provide you with the overall rating in terms of percentile and progress towards improvement targets.

1062
02:41:01,653 --> 02:41:03,494
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so the next slide, please.

1063
02:41:07,568 --> 02:41:13,491
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so key features of the Massachusetts Accountability System, as you can see from the slide.

1064
02:41:13,511 --> 02:41:23,377
[SPEAKER_20]: So in this accountability system, DESE establishes targets for the district and individual schools in several categories, including looking at MCAS achievement.

1065
02:41:23,777 --> 02:41:27,579
[SPEAKER_20]: So in ELA, in math, in science, technology, and engineering.

1066
02:41:28,540 --> 02:41:32,542
[SPEAKER_20]: Not only does it look at the achievement, but it looks at the specific growth.

1067
02:41:33,655 --> 02:41:35,637
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks at high school completion rates.

1068
02:41:36,277 --> 02:41:40,921
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks at the progress towards English language proficiency for English learners.

1069
02:41:42,262 --> 02:41:49,308
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks at chronic absenteeism, advanced coursework completion, and assessment participation.

1070
02:41:51,430 --> 02:41:57,815
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, all those different variables get funneled into a report.

1071
02:41:58,756 --> 02:42:01,298
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so on to the next slide, please.

1072
02:42:02,182 --> 02:42:07,525
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, so what you're seeing here are the percentile ranks for each one of the schools in the district.

1073
02:42:08,046 --> 02:42:11,928
[SPEAKER_20]: So you can see at the top, we have the Brooks Elementary School.

1074
02:42:12,308 --> 02:42:15,570
[SPEAKER_20]: They're at a 71% accountability percentile.

1075
02:42:15,930 --> 02:42:20,053
[SPEAKER_20]: So the 71st percentile is a pretty good place to be.

1076
02:42:20,613 --> 02:42:31,860
[SPEAKER_20]: That means that the Brooks Elementary School is 71 in the 71st percentile, so 71% of schools in that category, in the elementary school category,

1077
02:42:32,284 --> 02:42:36,286
[SPEAKER_20]: with grades between K and five, they are in that top 29%.

1078
02:42:38,867 --> 02:42:40,768
[SPEAKER_20]: So therefore, they're at a 71st percentile.

1079
02:42:41,148 --> 02:42:43,129
[SPEAKER_20]: As you go down the list, you can see the different schools.

1080
02:42:43,189 --> 02:42:51,173
[SPEAKER_20]: McGlynn Elementary at 35, Missituk at 29, Roberts at 37, Andrews at 44, McGlynn Middle at 28.

1081
02:42:51,653 --> 02:42:54,194
[SPEAKER_20]: There is no rating for the Curtis-Tufts because of the size.

1082
02:42:54,954 --> 02:42:57,616
[SPEAKER_20]: At the high school, 32, and the district overall is 42.

1083
02:42:58,871 --> 02:43:08,374
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think the big picture takeaway here is good news in that our district does not require any assistance or intervention.

1084
02:43:09,094 --> 02:43:16,997
[SPEAKER_20]: So when looking at all the different variables and the statistics that go into it, we did get good news.

1085
02:43:21,779 --> 02:43:22,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

1086
02:43:22,579 --> 02:43:25,540
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we want to wait till the end for questions?

1087
02:43:26,889 --> 02:43:44,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it could go either way but I do have more data to provide that's not my preference would be if they could present the full packet, and then I think it will, it'll tell more of a picture of the entire district.

1088
02:43:44,856 --> 02:43:45,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1089
02:43:48,106 --> 02:43:54,751
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, so the other overall progress rating is the progress towards improvement targets.

1090
02:43:55,211 --> 02:43:57,013
[SPEAKER_20]: So not pictured in the slide.

1091
02:43:57,433 --> 02:44:00,975
[SPEAKER_20]: I wanna let you know that there are seven different ratings.

1092
02:44:01,396 --> 02:44:09,401
[SPEAKER_20]: So the highest with regard to progress towards improvement targets for each one of the schools, it's not on this slide, Dr. Cushing, I apologize.

1093
02:44:09,942 --> 02:44:11,883
[SPEAKER_20]: The top one would be a school of recognition.

1094
02:44:12,864 --> 02:44:15,426
[SPEAKER_20]: The second one is meeting or exceeding targets.

1095
02:44:15,919 --> 02:44:19,280
[SPEAKER_20]: The third is substantial progress towards targets.

1096
02:44:20,420 --> 02:44:27,342
[SPEAKER_20]: I am happy to say that all four elementary schools in Medford achieved substantial progress toward targets.

1097
02:44:28,582 --> 02:44:31,843
[SPEAKER_20]: The next one is moderate progress towards meeting the target.

1098
02:44:32,303 --> 02:44:37,184
[SPEAKER_20]: Both of our middle schools achieved meeting moderate progress toward the target.

1099
02:44:38,065 --> 02:44:43,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Below that is limited or no progress, and Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School,

1100
02:44:44,428 --> 02:44:47,030
[SPEAKER_20]: did get that rating, limited or no progress.

1101
02:44:48,010 --> 02:44:53,313
[SPEAKER_20]: The two lower ratings focused in target support and broad comprehensive support are not.

1102
02:44:54,793 --> 02:44:57,616
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not designated for Medford.

1103
02:44:58,177 --> 02:45:01,300
[SPEAKER_20]: Overall, the district has made moderate progress.

1104
02:45:01,741 --> 02:45:12,833
[SPEAKER_20]: So just in summation, we have made moderate progress as a district, and we do not require assistance or intervention at this time based on the 2023 MCAS scores.

1105
02:45:17,396 --> 02:45:27,319
[SPEAKER_20]: On to the next slide, taking a big picture view of what DESE has put out and their takeaways when they released the scores.

1106
02:45:27,779 --> 02:45:35,841
[SPEAKER_20]: They state that the 2023 results show evidence of continued academic recovery from the pandemic.

1107
02:45:37,721 --> 02:45:44,403
[SPEAKER_20]: The 2023 ELA and math data indicate that the achievement slide from 2019 has halted and recovery is underway.

1108
02:45:44,483 --> 02:45:46,043
[SPEAKER_20]: So that is good news.

1109
02:45:46,941 --> 02:45:54,092
[SPEAKER_20]: Science results statewide remain relatively unchanged, although slight decreases in achievement.

1110
02:45:55,033 --> 02:46:02,744
[SPEAKER_20]: Grade three results signal a need to remain cautious about incoming testing in the early grades because of the pandemic.

1111
02:46:03,762 --> 02:46:09,603
[SPEAKER_20]: Districts still have significant ground to make up to reach pre-pandemic achievement levels in some areas.

1112
02:46:10,123 --> 02:46:15,224
[SPEAKER_20]: And lastly, state results mask varying district results.

1113
02:46:15,424 --> 02:46:18,705
[SPEAKER_20]: So there is a lot of variation in the results across the district.

1114
02:46:19,245 --> 02:46:21,846
[SPEAKER_20]: So again, those are the takeaways from DESE statewide.

1115
02:46:22,686 --> 02:46:26,127
[SPEAKER_20]: At this point, I am going to turn it over to Paul DeLava.

1116
02:46:26,207 --> 02:46:33,128
[SPEAKER_20]: He's gonna go over the growth and the achievement of the MCAS district achievement and growth results.

1117
02:46:36,832 --> 02:46:37,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, everyone.

1118
02:46:39,333 --> 02:46:40,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1119
02:46:41,114 --> 02:46:49,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to reiterate what Dr. Riccadeli said is when it comes to determining accountability percentages, there are different factors.

1120
02:46:50,957 --> 02:46:54,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of those factors are our achievement as well as our growth.

1121
02:46:55,559 --> 02:46:59,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Based on MCAS data, that has occurred a certain year.

1122
02:46:59,360 --> 02:47:01,401
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can move to the next slide.

1123
02:47:04,249 --> 02:47:13,074
[SPEAKER_14]: So here you have a slide of the average SGP for ELA and math of 2023 side by side.

1124
02:47:13,094 --> 02:47:19,598
[SPEAKER_14]: The goal is obviously to get typical growth on obviously above that as well.

1125
02:47:20,078 --> 02:47:22,920
[SPEAKER_14]: And typical growth is stated between 40 and 59%.

1126
02:47:25,101 --> 02:47:27,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously again, we'd like to be above that.

1127
02:47:27,102 --> 02:47:31,365
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm pleased to report that most of our grade levels are at that range level.

1128
02:47:31,425 --> 02:47:32,045
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have a,

1129
02:47:34,096 --> 02:47:41,058
[SPEAKER_14]: dipping growth in math by 39%, so just missing the typical growth percentile mark.

1130
02:47:41,959 --> 02:47:46,380
[SPEAKER_14]: The idea here is to just kind of compare the two that are there.

1131
02:47:46,600 --> 02:47:51,201
[SPEAKER_14]: You won't see science due to the fact that it only comes in three grades.

1132
02:47:51,682 --> 02:48:02,105
[SPEAKER_14]: So three, I'm sorry, five, eight, and ninth grade is when the science, and I'll obviously let Mrs. Cieri talk more about that as well.

1133
02:48:03,024 --> 02:48:24,644
[SPEAKER_14]: On the next slide that is there again talking about growth between two years, we have a comparison of 2022 to 2023 data that is there and again, you can see that there is some growth in some areas and some decline in some areas as well, and again when we start talking more about.

1134
02:48:25,673 --> 02:48:35,101
[SPEAKER_14]: the actual district data or the district data for each MCAS subject, you'll see what the achievement goes regarding the growth.

1135
02:48:35,141 --> 02:48:46,570
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, reminding everyone, we're looking at last year's fifth grade to let's say 2022's fifth grade to 2023 fifth grade.

1136
02:48:47,091 --> 02:48:49,433
[SPEAKER_14]: And from there, that's where you get your growth percentile.

1137
02:48:49,473 --> 02:48:51,074
[SPEAKER_14]: You get your Delta that

1138
02:48:51,872 --> 02:48:54,513
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, based on the achievement from that grade from before.

1139
02:48:54,573 --> 02:48:56,554
[SPEAKER_14]: We do do cohort data as well.

1140
02:48:57,035 --> 02:48:58,576
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think you have those in your reports.

1141
02:48:58,656 --> 02:49:01,017
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't wanna speak out of turn.

1142
02:49:01,057 --> 02:49:05,699
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not on the slide deck, but we do also look at certain cohorts.

1143
02:49:05,779 --> 02:49:15,905
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you look at from 2021 to 2022 to 2023, by grade level, you could technically follow what they were in a certain grade and moving on to the next grade.

1144
02:49:15,945 --> 02:49:18,626
[SPEAKER_14]: You just have to decipher it out, but it is there.

1145
02:49:20,276 --> 02:49:23,377
[SPEAKER_14]: And now I'd like to turn it over to Achievement for Dr. Chiesa.

1146
02:49:23,397 --> 02:49:25,438
[SPEAKER_14]: She'll go over the ELA Achievement results.

1147
02:49:33,121 --> 02:49:34,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, everybody.

1148
02:49:35,862 --> 02:49:41,844
[SPEAKER_00]: You were provided with a very detailed report on ELA MCAS results.

1149
02:49:42,044 --> 02:49:48,327
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you have in front of you for this is a summary of how we did

1150
02:49:49,193 --> 02:49:52,354
[SPEAKER_00]: across the different grade levels as compared to the state.

1151
02:49:53,135 --> 02:49:58,056
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see, performance as compared to the state varied across the grade levels.

1152
02:49:58,757 --> 02:50:05,079
[SPEAKER_00]: We had third and fourth and eighth grade outperforming the state, and we had fifth, sixth, seventh falling below.

1153
02:50:05,979 --> 02:50:17,324
[SPEAKER_00]: In all cases, as was just explained, typical growth was achieved at all grade levels, but there is obviously a lot more drill down analysis, some of which you do have in that,

1154
02:50:18,584 --> 02:50:19,724
[SPEAKER_00]: documented report.

1155
02:50:21,885 --> 02:50:33,508
[SPEAKER_00]: The next slide is taking the information that you just saw and including some historical data with 2022.

1156
02:50:34,248 --> 02:50:40,550
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not include 2021 because 2021 was an abbreviated exam.

1157
02:50:40,570 --> 02:50:45,051
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the year where they took MCAS for half a session instead of the full.

1158
02:50:46,076 --> 02:50:56,103
[SPEAKER_00]: So this historical data would be the most accurate for comparison sake, and you can see how the grades are doing as they move year to year.

1159
02:50:58,865 --> 02:51:02,628
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, those are my two slides for tonight.

1160
02:51:02,648 --> 02:51:10,633
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to answer questions at the end, I believe, but you do also have much more detail in another report as well.

1161
02:51:11,754 --> 02:51:12,154
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1162
02:51:12,254 --> 02:51:13,715
[SPEAKER_00]: I will now pass it over to Ms.

1163
02:51:13,735 --> 02:51:14,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Kahn.

1164
02:51:23,527 --> 02:51:26,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Dr. Chiesa and good evening.

1165
02:51:27,569 --> 02:51:32,411
[SPEAKER_15]: My two slides are basically the next one, please.

1166
02:51:32,592 --> 02:51:33,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1167
02:51:34,292 --> 02:51:34,693
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1168
02:51:34,733 --> 02:51:44,177
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm here to present the MCAS scores for this year and the next slide will talk about the comparison between the 2022 school year.

1169
02:51:46,155 --> 02:51:53,257
[SPEAKER_15]: As Dr. Key, as I said, you have the report on math MCAS results for this year as well.

1170
02:51:54,377 --> 02:52:03,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we see the gap between the state and the school at two grade levels being larger than the others.

1171
02:52:04,520 --> 02:52:06,401
[SPEAKER_15]: That's grade seven and grade 10.

1172
02:52:08,954 --> 02:52:28,910
[SPEAKER_15]: As we drill down into the data, we know the reasons for these two grades to not be performing at the historical level, at least, where the scores used to be in much more, the gap was much closer for grade seven and grade 10.

1173
02:52:30,271 --> 02:52:32,153
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been having discussions with the teachers.

1174
02:52:33,243 --> 02:52:36,564
[SPEAKER_15]: and I believe we have gone in more detail in the report.

1175
02:52:38,185 --> 02:52:52,391
[SPEAKER_15]: On the next slide, we see the comparison, as Dr. Kiaza's slide showed, between last year and this year's meeting and exceeding expectations, the two categories combined.

1176
02:52:53,832 --> 02:52:55,653
[SPEAKER_15]: What we note is that from 2022 to 2023,

1177
02:52:59,158 --> 02:53:02,841
[SPEAKER_15]: We closed the gap in grades three, four, six, and eight.

1178
02:53:03,942 --> 02:53:12,148
[SPEAKER_15]: We stayed the same for grade five, pretty much, and increased the gap in grades seven and 10.

1179
02:53:13,809 --> 02:53:24,438
[SPEAKER_15]: The biggest gaps that we closed were in grades four and eight, and you can see it with the numbers right there.

1180
02:53:25,919 --> 02:53:28,461
[SPEAKER_15]: And we are working

1181
02:53:28,806 --> 02:53:35,532
[SPEAKER_15]: to continue closing those gaps at the other grade levels as well, but more to come.

1182
02:53:36,313 --> 02:53:40,537
[SPEAKER_15]: And I turn it to Mr. Cieri for science.

1183
02:53:40,717 --> 02:53:41,237
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1184
02:53:48,444 --> 02:53:49,345
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everyone.

1185
02:53:52,007 --> 02:53:55,310
[SPEAKER_11]: We can change that to the next slide, Dr. Kush.

1186
02:53:59,158 --> 02:53:59,518
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we are.

1187
02:54:01,740 --> 02:54:09,547
[SPEAKER_12]: As was stated previously, the science MCAS is only given in three grade levels, grade 5, 8, and grade 9 for high school.

1188
02:54:11,015 --> 02:54:17,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Currently, the students compared to the state are only a couple of percentage points off at grade five.

1189
02:54:17,958 --> 02:54:25,220
[SPEAKER_12]: They're actually at the meets and exceeds expectations level.

1190
02:54:26,201 --> 02:54:30,402
[SPEAKER_12]: And for the middle school, they're above, I believe it's six points.

1191
02:54:30,442 --> 02:54:38,805
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't really see the number, but I believe it's six points above the state for this past year for grade eight, which is a highlight.

1192
02:54:40,065 --> 02:54:44,526
[SPEAKER_12]: At the high school, they're one percentage point below at the meets and exceeds level.

1193
02:54:44,846 --> 02:54:53,388
[SPEAKER_12]: But we also want to recall that last year was the first year of implementation of those new achievement standards.

1194
02:54:54,308 --> 02:55:01,690
[SPEAKER_12]: And the students that took the exam last year had a slightly lower bar to meet by three points.

1195
02:55:03,399 --> 02:55:10,683
[SPEAKER_12]: This year, it kind of went full blown with the new achievement levels for the high school.

1196
02:55:11,443 --> 02:55:22,689
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't seem to have had any different effect on the students, but you'll notice on the next slide, just to show the comparison between 2022 and 2023.

1197
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:35,266
[SPEAKER_12]: that we, it almost shows that the grade nine remained flat both at the state and in Medford for the meets and the exceeds.

1198
02:55:37,447 --> 02:55:52,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Something in the report that is not on the slide is that there is an overall decrease at grade nine of students at the lowest level and an increase in the

1199
02:55:54,858 --> 02:56:06,785
[SPEAKER_12]: partially meeting expectations, which is actually good news because less kids would need to take additional testing to pass their competency determination.

1200
02:56:07,866 --> 02:56:13,389
[SPEAKER_12]: So while the data is not wonderful,

1201
02:56:14,108 --> 02:56:23,855
[SPEAKER_12]: It isn't, it is in line with the state and also some growth at grade eight, which is really, really good news for this year.

1202
02:56:24,135 --> 02:56:25,696
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll take the win there.

1203
02:56:27,297 --> 02:56:32,241
[SPEAKER_12]: And at this point, we're gonna go to the graduation requirements for the class of 2025.

1204
02:56:34,102 --> 02:56:36,043
[SPEAKER_12]: And Mr. DeLava is gonna present that.

1205
02:56:39,085 --> 02:56:41,367
[SPEAKER_14]: I bet you guys are wondering why I was picked to do this slide.

1206
02:56:42,148 --> 02:56:42,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

1207
02:56:44,354 --> 02:56:53,418
[SPEAKER_14]: So based on MCAS results, you know, MCAS results are still a requirement for graduation.

1208
02:56:53,498 --> 02:57:02,342
[SPEAKER_14]: So students getting a diploma need to pass a competency determination in order to receive that diploma.

1209
02:57:02,382 --> 02:57:05,904
[SPEAKER_14]: If they do not, they get a certificate of attendance.

1210
02:57:06,044 --> 02:57:11,566
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm proud to say that a lot of our students have made this competency determination

1211
02:57:12,512 --> 02:57:15,494
[SPEAKER_14]: through the years of what I remember as being principal at the high school.

1212
02:57:16,434 --> 02:57:26,980
[SPEAKER_14]: But there are levels of making competency determination dependent on meeting and exceeding expectations, but also partially meeting expectations.

1213
02:57:27,040 --> 02:57:37,366
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you look at ELA, option one, if you earn a score of 472 or higher, you do not have to have an EPP present.

1214
02:57:38,106 --> 02:57:41,808
[SPEAKER_14]: The range goes from 560 as being the max score,

1215
02:57:42,492 --> 02:57:45,013
[SPEAKER_14]: to 500 of meeting, right?

1216
02:57:45,133 --> 02:57:50,396
[SPEAKER_14]: And then when you go down by 470, you're not meeting expectations.

1217
02:57:50,496 --> 02:58:05,443
[SPEAKER_14]: So within the partially meeting expectations, you run into two categories, students that made their competency determination and don't need an EPP and the ones that do still need an EPP as they're going through.

1218
02:58:05,483 --> 02:58:10,005
[SPEAKER_14]: So they come up, we come up with educational proficiency plans for those students.

1219
02:58:10,837 --> 02:58:19,825
[SPEAKER_14]: in the certain subjects that they need, the ones that are on the lower end of partially meeting expectations, those that did not meet expectations have to do our retests.

1220
02:58:20,625 --> 02:58:24,449
[SPEAKER_14]: And those retests then occur, actually ones occurring in November.

1221
02:58:25,109 --> 02:58:33,196
[SPEAKER_14]: We have them in February for science, March again as a retest, and then the actual MCAS for the current 10th graders again.

1222
02:58:33,976 --> 02:58:38,000
[SPEAKER_14]: All those students have the ability to obviously retest during all those windows.

1223
02:58:38,612 --> 02:58:47,799
[SPEAKER_14]: that are there, including the 10th grade grand year of doing MCAS, because obviously we wanna give our students as many opportunities as possible.

1224
02:58:48,580 --> 02:58:51,783
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you look at the partially meeting parts, you have ELA at 472, right?

1225
02:58:51,803 --> 02:58:55,185
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you're between 455 and 471, you have to have that EEP.

1226
02:58:55,245 --> 02:58:56,486
[SPEAKER_14]: For math, it would be between 469 and 485.

1227
02:58:56,587 --> 02:58:57,427
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're 486 and above,

1228
02:59:06,135 --> 02:59:10,137
[SPEAKER_14]: you don't need the EPP, you've made your competency determination as well.

1229
02:59:10,237 --> 02:59:13,078
[SPEAKER_14]: And then as for the science, it's at 470.

1230
02:59:14,559 --> 02:59:23,723
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to remind everybody that during the time for science, we've transitioned over to biology for all ninth graders.

1231
02:59:24,444 --> 02:59:33,728
[SPEAKER_14]: So all our ninth graders currently take biology their freshman year, as they're taking their MCAS in ninth grade, they're taking the MCAS bio.

1232
02:59:35,467 --> 02:59:37,188
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we can move to the next slide.

1233
02:59:39,449 --> 02:59:45,192
[SPEAKER_14]: This is just an analysis based on what we use as a district analysis and review tool.

1234
02:59:45,313 --> 02:59:46,133
[SPEAKER_14]: It is from DESE.

1235
02:59:46,913 --> 02:59:54,498
[SPEAKER_14]: And what DESE does is it takes Medford, it takes Medford's data and compares it to other districts that are there.

1236
02:59:54,558 --> 02:59:56,399
[SPEAKER_14]: So what's listed there is what came out.

1237
02:59:57,619 --> 02:59:59,821
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can see some comparable districts that are there.

1238
02:59:59,881 --> 03:00:04,163
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know people say like, okay, well, why didn't we just pick Malden or why didn't we just pick

1239
03:00:05,066 --> 03:00:09,087
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Somerville's there, but why don't we just pick Everett or for that?

1240
03:00:09,207 --> 03:00:16,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what we're doing is we're taking what other districts that have our profile and we're comparing ourselves to that.

1241
03:00:16,330 --> 03:00:22,811
[SPEAKER_14]: So looking at these change in data, I think again, very promising.

1242
03:00:22,851 --> 03:00:34,115
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, obviously, you know, I, I like Quincy's numbers in some cases and things that we can look at to see like, what are their demographics compared to our demographics and see

1243
03:00:35,031 --> 03:00:37,553
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, what the achievement rate is during that time.

1244
03:00:37,793 --> 03:00:42,156
[SPEAKER_14]: So by comparable, but again, you can always compare on the dart.

1245
03:00:42,196 --> 03:00:47,980
[SPEAKER_14]: You can always pick any district that you want, as well as what's listed there.

1246
03:00:48,040 --> 03:00:54,985
[SPEAKER_14]: So one of the ones we sometimes tend to compare ourselves as Waltham, but it didn't come up on our profile this year.

1247
03:00:55,045 --> 03:00:58,407
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and that is it for me.

1248
03:00:58,527 --> 03:01:03,711
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that Joan Bowen, Director of Pupil Services is going to go over the MCAS alts with you.

1249
03:01:06,305 --> 03:01:06,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

1250
03:01:08,727 --> 03:01:09,527
[SPEAKER_21]: Next slide please.

1251
03:01:11,729 --> 03:01:16,672
[SPEAKER_21]: So the standard MCAS is used to measure students.

1252
03:01:17,332 --> 03:01:18,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on one second, sorry.

1253
03:01:26,414 --> 03:01:31,916
[SPEAKER_21]: designed to measure a student's knowledge of key concepts and skills outlined in the mass curriculum frameworks.

1254
03:01:32,356 --> 03:01:37,737
[SPEAKER_21]: But we have students with significant disabilities that cannot participate in the standardized test.

1255
03:01:38,277 --> 03:01:43,339
[SPEAKER_21]: So what we do is they are eligible to take the MCAS alternate assessment.

1256
03:01:44,459 --> 03:01:46,520
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is determined at a team meeting.

1257
03:01:47,260 --> 03:01:52,321
[SPEAKER_21]: The team talks about whether or not the student can participate in the standard MCAS assessment.

1258
03:01:52,741 --> 03:01:55,222
[SPEAKER_21]: And if not, they use the MCAS alternate

1259
03:01:55,711 --> 03:02:01,913
[SPEAKER_21]: participation tool, which has been revised this year through DESE, and I've included a copy in your packet.

1260
03:02:03,453 --> 03:02:17,677
[SPEAKER_21]: So the MCAS all consists of a portfolio that's collected from the start of the school year, placed in a binder, organized according to if they're taking math, ELA, or science.

1261
03:02:18,617 --> 03:02:21,058
[SPEAKER_21]: The teacher collects it, and the students.

1262
03:02:21,078 --> 03:02:22,038
[SPEAKER_21]: So evidence could be

1263
03:02:22,861 --> 03:02:27,502
[SPEAKER_21]: work samples, instructional data, videotapes, and other supporting documents.

1264
03:02:29,223 --> 03:02:30,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Next slide, please.

1265
03:02:31,624 --> 03:02:43,487
[SPEAKER_21]: The ALT assessment is scored based on the following rubric, and they look at if a student is progressing, emerging, awareness, or if the portfolio is incomplete.

1266
03:02:44,888 --> 03:02:45,628
[SPEAKER_21]: Next slide, please.

1267
03:02:47,379 --> 03:02:53,605
[SPEAKER_21]: Within the district, we had a total of 19 students that participated in the MCAS ALT assessment.

1268
03:02:54,005 --> 03:02:59,510
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've given you a breakdown by grade level, how many students, as well as their student demographics.

1269
03:02:59,971 --> 03:03:11,942
[SPEAKER_21]: So we had six white students, five students that were of color, we had five Asian students, and three students who are Hispanic or Latino participated.

1270
03:03:13,942 --> 03:03:27,945
[SPEAKER_21]: In our out-of-district programming, we had a total of 10 out-of-district students participate in the MCAS ALT, and I also broke that down by grade level and the number of students, as well as the student demographics for our out-of-district students.

1271
03:03:29,786 --> 03:03:30,606
[SPEAKER_21]: Next slide, please.

1272
03:03:31,886 --> 03:03:42,689
[SPEAKER_21]: So basically, what it looks at is in the area of English language arts, we have 52% of our students who participated in the ELA

1273
03:03:43,678 --> 03:03:48,600
[SPEAKER_21]: MCAS alt that are progressing and 44 received emerging.

1274
03:03:50,261 --> 03:04:00,946
[SPEAKER_21]: In the math, all grades, 68% of our students are progressing, 16% are emerging and 16% had incomplete portfolios.

1275
03:04:01,286 --> 03:04:08,509
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's an area of concern that we need to relook at that, the data that the teachers are collecting, how they're documenting it,

1276
03:04:09,831 --> 03:04:17,157
[SPEAKER_21]: And I can explain some of the reasons why a MCAS alt assessment was incomplete at the end of this presentation.

1277
03:04:17,177 --> 03:04:27,385
[SPEAKER_21]: And then in science and technology, 83% of our students were progressing, 8% were emerging, and 8% had incomplete portfolios.

1278
03:04:29,151 --> 03:04:35,316
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of the reasons for the incomplete portfolios was the evidence did not address the skill in the measurable outcomes.

1279
03:04:36,277 --> 03:04:43,644
[SPEAKER_21]: Descriptions did not address skill were not included in the measurable outcomes, or there was missing or insufficient evidence.

1280
03:04:45,084 --> 03:04:58,491
[SPEAKER_21]: And based on that feedback from Desi, everyone I think I included in the packet was an example of what the scoring sheet looks like that our out-of-district and our students who have participated in the MCAS all receive.

1281
03:04:59,311 --> 03:05:10,497
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of the recommendations were just to go back and review the requirements in the educator manual, to attend Desi-sponsored training sessions, and to review guidelines for measurable outcomes.

1282
03:05:11,172 --> 03:05:19,657
[SPEAKER_21]: But some of the feedback we did receive from dusty was the binder was well organized assessments contain the required strength strands for this grade.

1283
03:05:20,757 --> 03:05:30,563
[SPEAKER_21]: The strand showed evidence of open ended questions creative approaches that allowed the student to demonstrate knowledge and skills, so we will continue to work with our staff, we have.

1284
03:05:32,230 --> 03:05:38,031
[SPEAKER_21]: We try to meet with them on a regular basis to see what their progress is in collecting the data.

1285
03:05:38,291 --> 03:05:40,912
[SPEAKER_21]: We have them attend any MCAS ALT trainings.

1286
03:05:41,512 --> 03:05:49,054
[SPEAKER_21]: And we also have several veteran teachers who are very good at doing MCAS ALT, and they provide workshops throughout the year.

1287
03:05:49,074 --> 03:05:51,715
[SPEAKER_21]: With the teachers drop in, we can review your binder.

1288
03:05:51,755 --> 03:05:54,335
[SPEAKER_21]: So we'll take a closer look at the incompletes as well.

1289
03:05:55,595 --> 03:05:57,236
[SPEAKER_21]: And that is it for me.

1290
03:05:57,336 --> 03:05:57,636
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1291
03:06:02,458 --> 03:06:17,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so I know we'll end if anyone has any questions, but I just wanted to review last month when we came and we discussed the instructional priorities for the district this school year.

1292
03:06:18,206 --> 03:06:24,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of that came from the work that we had from the comprehensive review through the Department of Education last year.

1293
03:06:25,129 --> 03:06:30,852
[SPEAKER_09]: And our instructional priorities are the pathway for us to improve as a district.

1294
03:06:31,400 --> 03:06:46,635
[SPEAKER_09]: And so those instructional priorities, if you could just go to the next slide, please, Dr. Cushing, were discussed with this body last month, but they're very applicable to our path forward to continue increasing our MCAS results.

1295
03:06:47,796 --> 03:06:52,321
[SPEAKER_09]: So just as a very brief recap, this school year we are

1296
03:06:52,836 --> 03:06:56,158
[SPEAKER_09]: focusing on high quality instructional professional development.

1297
03:06:56,898 --> 03:07:05,782
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are again, Dr. Edouard Vincent spoke about this in her goals, but we are going to be looking at data informed decision making with staff.

1298
03:07:06,443 --> 03:07:09,444
[SPEAKER_09]: We are going to be focusing again on our literacy.

1299
03:07:10,645 --> 03:07:21,970
[SPEAKER_09]: We're using two, we are partnering with two outfits, Hill for Literacy and Mantra to be working on student centered data analysis and planning with

1300
03:07:22,774 --> 03:07:35,904
[SPEAKER_09]: our staff that will be done through common planning time at the elementary level, as well at, well, all levels, as well as instructional leadership teams that will be created district-wide.

1301
03:07:37,665 --> 03:07:51,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Principals are in the process of organizing those and having staff attend so that we're looking at the data that we are analyzing to make these improvements and learning walks will be

1302
03:07:52,239 --> 03:07:56,242
[SPEAKER_09]: beginning, as Dr. Edouard-Vincent also commented on.

1303
03:07:57,723 --> 03:08:05,908
[SPEAKER_09]: At this time, if you have any questions, the team is here and we can come up collectively or one at a time.

1304
03:08:09,811 --> 03:08:12,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, we'll just start to see what the questions are.

1305
03:08:12,293 --> 03:08:14,875
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I know we have a resident that has a question.

1306
03:08:14,895 --> 03:08:17,676
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll start with member Hays and then member McLaughlin.

1307
03:08:19,478 --> 03:08:19,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1308
03:08:19,958 --> 03:08:21,259
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's more of a

1309
03:08:21,912 --> 03:08:26,893
[SPEAKER_04]: a comment, I guess, than a specific question about the data, well, about specific data.

1310
03:08:26,913 --> 03:08:48,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, so year after year, I feel like we, we look at the, when I pull out the data, again, by school, I feel like the overall scores that were presented, and I know this was a much more abbreviated version than we've had in the past even, you know, the scores when it's just across the district by grade level,

1311
03:08:49,099 --> 03:08:53,340
[SPEAKER_04]: really obscure some significant differences across the schools.

1312
03:08:54,020 --> 03:09:14,805
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like that does a disservice to the community and to parents in terms of their understanding of what's really happening in the district and their ability to really question us and question you about what's being done about some of these scores that are remarkably low in comparison across schools.

1313
03:09:15,265 --> 03:09:15,865
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, again,

1314
03:09:17,452 --> 03:09:20,755
[SPEAKER_04]: The Brooks is consistently higher, almost always across the board.

1315
03:09:20,795 --> 03:09:30,042
[SPEAKER_04]: There have been some variations in that, but then, you know, I'm more concerned, I mean, that concerned me because there's always the question I've asked before, what are we doing about that?

1316
03:09:31,603 --> 03:09:45,555
[SPEAKER_04]: But more importantly, when I look at scores, like, you know, 25% of the fourth graders in McGlynn were meeting or exceeding mathematics.

1317
03:09:46,486 --> 03:09:49,088
[SPEAKER_04]: 25% is alarmingly low.

1318
03:09:49,108 --> 03:09:55,031
[SPEAKER_04]: 30% of Mississippi fourth graders were meeting or exceeding ELA.

1319
03:09:57,392 --> 03:10:01,854
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was a decrease of 49% in 2022, a decrease.

1320
03:10:02,255 --> 03:10:08,298
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're talking, you know, we present data and say, look, the state says we're meeting expectations.

1321
03:10:09,474 --> 03:10:21,361
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, but we, you know, we really deserve both the school committee and the community deserves a deeper dive, an explanation of these differences in scores.

1322
03:10:24,983 --> 03:10:37,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think some of them are, I personally, I think some of them are truly, as I said, alarming, especially when you look at, we're telling, we're saying that the state is saying we're making

1323
03:10:38,410 --> 03:10:45,035
[SPEAKER_04]: growth, and I know that as you've presented, there's a lot of data that goes into that, and that's important to understand.

1324
03:10:45,835 --> 03:10:53,660
[SPEAKER_04]: And that student growth potential, I think, is a huge and really complicated statistic to pull into it.

1325
03:10:54,021 --> 03:11:07,670
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think that some kind of a deeper dive and a narrative in some of these explaining the differences between the schools is necessary, and it's not in here.

1326
03:11:10,204 --> 03:11:21,250
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, that's more a comment, I guess, than a question because I see some real issues in our numbers here and the presentation as was doesn't reflect that.

1327
03:11:22,371 --> 03:11:23,732
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot to unpack there.

1328
03:11:24,973 --> 03:11:26,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a couple things.

1329
03:11:26,834 --> 03:11:36,639
[SPEAKER_09]: So one, it's difficult to look at scores that are less than 50% and feel encouraged by them.

1330
03:11:39,426 --> 03:11:42,287
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hear that and understand completely.

1331
03:11:42,547 --> 03:11:48,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is when you do have to look at the entire state is at that same spot.

1332
03:11:48,930 --> 03:12:01,976
[SPEAKER_09]: So COVID did a dramatic halting disservice to our students that is going to take a very long time to get back to where we were originally.

1333
03:12:02,536 --> 03:12:08,779
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not just meant for public schools, but that is not minimizing that we have work to do because we have work to do.

1334
03:12:09,540 --> 03:12:26,985
[SPEAKER_09]: So part of what you're talking about, and I apologize if I wasn't as clear, but part of that dive is what needs to be happening at the grade level in common planning time, in instructional leadership time, with principals, with department heads, and with staff.

1335
03:12:27,845 --> 03:12:37,548
[SPEAKER_09]: And that deep dive is looking at the MCAS results by standard, by area, to see where our students had the most difficulties,

1336
03:12:38,078 --> 03:12:41,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Where in our curriculum are those standards present?

1337
03:12:42,241 --> 03:12:44,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we need to move things around?

1338
03:12:44,423 --> 03:12:57,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have to focus a little bit more on the specific standards that are causing some of our students, depending on the grade level, with more increased challenges than what we're seeing across the state?

1339
03:12:59,513 --> 03:13:02,356
[SPEAKER_09]: I know I'm, does that, yeah, please.

1340
03:13:02,676 --> 03:13:04,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just trying to remember the rest of the question.

1341
03:13:06,098 --> 03:13:09,562
[SPEAKER_14]: So before we gave you this report, there was a lot of analysis that we did.

1342
03:13:11,103 --> 03:13:14,307
[SPEAKER_14]: And some things that keep coming up are different factors of different years.

1343
03:13:14,427 --> 03:13:17,010
[SPEAKER_14]: So I, you know, in my head, I was trying to do three years.

1344
03:13:17,871 --> 03:13:25,739
[SPEAKER_14]: But then when we started looking at 2021 we realized that it wasn't like the full MCAS test that was given because we were just coming back

1345
03:13:26,924 --> 03:13:27,825
[SPEAKER_14]: from the pandemic.

1346
03:13:27,865 --> 03:13:30,627
[SPEAKER_14]: So everyone sort of had a half a test at that point in time.

1347
03:13:30,787 --> 03:13:32,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And participation rates were lower.

1348
03:13:32,588 --> 03:13:32,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1349
03:13:33,689 --> 03:13:36,331
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason why you don't see, I'm glad you brought that up.

1350
03:13:36,391 --> 03:13:41,194
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why you don't see the participation rates is right now our participation rates are really high.

1351
03:13:41,675 --> 03:13:42,656
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're at like 99%, 98%.

1352
03:13:43,176 --> 03:13:47,979
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're like, okay, what, what story is that going to tell?

1353
03:13:48,039 --> 03:13:48,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1354
03:13:48,320 --> 03:13:53,123
[SPEAKER_14]: We had everybody that needed to take the test that needed to take, take the test.

1355
03:13:53,243 --> 03:13:54,844
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think in what,

1356
03:13:56,144 --> 03:13:58,245
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to call her Dr. Galuzzi because she's almost there.

1357
03:13:58,745 --> 03:14:08,888
[SPEAKER_14]: But what what she was saying is, again, part of my role is what I've been doing is I've actually been going from school to school at their CVTs and we've been looking at their map.

1358
03:14:09,348 --> 03:14:11,528
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been comparing their MCAS scores.

1359
03:14:12,008 --> 03:14:14,649
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been getting into the item analysis pieces.

1360
03:14:15,029 --> 03:14:17,490
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess what I'm trying to say is this is the behind the scenes.

1361
03:14:18,476 --> 03:14:23,040
[SPEAKER_14]: thing that this report's not coming out as, but these are the things that we're trying to do.

1362
03:14:23,100 --> 03:14:28,524
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, and the hard part too, is we're figuring out K through two doesn't even have an MCAS.

1363
03:14:29,765 --> 03:14:34,949
[SPEAKER_14]: So what are we using to make sure that they're prepared in order to take their MCAS when they're moving up to third grade?

1364
03:14:36,110 --> 03:14:39,653
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't disagree with what you're saying regarding school to school stuff.

1365
03:14:40,233 --> 03:14:46,018
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there's, again, everyone can attest, we had a ton of slides.

1366
03:14:47,088 --> 03:14:49,450
[SPEAKER_14]: sort of manage and cut down in a little bit.

1367
03:14:49,510 --> 03:14:57,776
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, we're trying to portray the story that we see compared to the state, because the state is seeing similar things that's going on in Medford.

1368
03:14:58,196 --> 03:15:07,383
[SPEAKER_14]: Not completely, I want to say it's completely equal on every side, but the reality is there is some pieces there that are very similar.

1369
03:15:08,604 --> 03:15:14,088
[SPEAKER_14]: And so when we're looking at those percentages, we want to see like, is the state of Massachusetts, I mean, I feel,

1370
03:15:15,711 --> 03:15:22,694
[SPEAKER_14]: when looking at that, and I'll bring it up, in the growth of math at the high school, of course, that's something I'm gonna look at, right?

1371
03:15:24,055 --> 03:15:26,196
[SPEAKER_14]: To see that dip was kind of hard.

1372
03:15:26,556 --> 03:15:38,141
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a hard thing to see, because you feel like everybody's prepared, and we've done this before, and we've been there, and it just was lower than it was expected to be.

1373
03:15:38,262 --> 03:15:43,324
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are pieces, obviously, in the report that aren't telling,

1374
03:15:43,823 --> 03:15:54,348
[SPEAKER_14]: the greatest story in the world, but I think we're trying to use what we said with the other report, baselines from COVID to get to where we need to get.

1375
03:15:55,329 --> 03:16:11,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I hope as a, you know, now as our new data director, looking at ways to, again, bring the community in on some of this, certainly parent support at home, if parents don't

1376
03:16:12,301 --> 03:16:15,882
[SPEAKER_04]: fully grasp kind of what the big picture is.

1377
03:16:15,902 --> 03:16:28,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, I think it's important for our parents to understand some of this data more so that they can be more involved and understand and not just, you know.

1378
03:16:29,004 --> 03:16:31,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, just being told it's good.

1379
03:16:31,965 --> 03:16:33,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's kind of what it feels like.

1380
03:16:33,965 --> 03:16:36,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's often this, well, we're 1% better than the state average.

1381
03:16:37,026 --> 03:16:37,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1382
03:16:37,674 --> 03:16:42,897
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that's not our goal, honestly, because the state average includes a lot of places that are really low.

1383
03:16:44,338 --> 03:16:59,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, obviously that is our minimum, we do want, you know, but looking at hopefully loftier goals than that, as I think member Graham was saying, looking at, you know, when we were talking about superintendents evaluation,

1384
03:17:00,219 --> 03:17:01,039
[SPEAKER_04]: What are our goals?

1385
03:17:01,239 --> 03:17:04,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that really our ultimate goal is to be within 1% of the state average.

1386
03:17:04,900 --> 03:17:10,501
[SPEAKER_04]: So presenting data in a way that makes that clearer for people.

1387
03:17:10,581 --> 03:17:20,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't feel like the presentations are necessarily a vehicle for full understanding for parents and the community in general.

1388
03:17:20,363 --> 03:17:24,544
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we can note that and hopefully follow up.

1389
03:17:25,384 --> 03:17:28,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I understand the desire to be positive and there is positive.

1390
03:17:28,837 --> 03:17:38,145
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is that comparison that, yes, we always keep in mind COVID, but I just have often felt that there's a little bit of obscuring of some of the negatives.

1391
03:17:38,245 --> 03:17:41,528
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think people need to hear that and they need to understand it.

1392
03:17:41,608 --> 03:17:46,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's only fair to them to really... Go ahead, Ms.

1393
03:17:46,312 --> 03:17:46,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Galussi.

1394
03:17:48,113 --> 03:17:48,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mouth opened.

1395
03:17:49,194 --> 03:17:52,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was just going to say that I don't think that's... I just want to clarify that's not our intention.

1396
03:17:53,478 --> 03:17:57,001
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think by these slides, you can see that's not our intention because

1397
03:17:58,528 --> 03:18:01,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Data doesn't lie.

1398
03:18:01,409 --> 03:18:10,252
[SPEAKER_09]: So we know that we have work to do, but we're also trying to be, Medford has always prioritized the whole child and educating the whole child.

1399
03:18:10,412 --> 03:18:11,932
[SPEAKER_09]: And yes, MCAS is important.

1400
03:18:12,272 --> 03:18:14,393
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it is a graduation requirement.

1401
03:18:14,993 --> 03:18:21,335
[SPEAKER_09]: However, it is one summative test that is just one piece of data for teachers to use.

1402
03:18:21,955 --> 03:18:26,737
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm not, we're not trying to mask anything, but I just want,

1403
03:18:27,619 --> 03:18:39,125
[SPEAKER_09]: as evidenced by the slides, but I think Medford has increasingly become the tale of two cities.

1404
03:18:40,005 --> 03:18:47,288
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we now know, and I've said this before, out of the four elementary schools, two qualify for Title I and two do not.

1405
03:18:47,749 --> 03:18:55,432
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are two schools that need a lot more support than at the elementary level, than the other two schools.

1406
03:18:55,752 --> 03:18:56,753
[SPEAKER_09]: So demographics,

1407
03:18:58,004 --> 03:19:03,225
[SPEAKER_09]: whether that's the ugly truth, but demographics do play a role in some of this data.

1408
03:19:04,605 --> 03:19:16,768
[SPEAKER_09]: In comparison, when we overlay these results, they do line up a little bit with the DESI comprehensive report that we had last year.

1409
03:19:17,448 --> 03:19:24,590
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we do feel 100% that part of the path forward to focusing on the subgroups,

1410
03:19:25,091 --> 03:19:39,945
[SPEAKER_09]: and to making sure that students are all getting quality instruction is really to ground teachers in the data that they should be looking at to improve instruction.

1411
03:19:40,265 --> 03:19:43,028
[SPEAKER_09]: That's tier one instruction, that's tier two instruction.

1412
03:19:43,533 --> 03:20:10,750
[SPEAKER_09]: So the work that we're doing this year with really having school leaders and instructional leaders that are here tonight, working with staff on instructional data that are tied to the standards with more work for students, more cognitive push for students and less teacher talk, that we really firmly believe that that is the path to increase these scores.

1413
03:20:12,452 --> 03:20:30,917
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did hear from the comprehensive review that one of the concerns of teachers, that they were not feeling that they had, or not, wasn't all of them necessarily, but a lot of them were not feeling they had the time or the emphasis or ability to use the data the way that.

1414
03:20:31,538 --> 03:20:39,840
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why the shift with the elementary schedule, the half day PDs that are happening now district wide, there's one this Wednesday,

1415
03:20:40,700 --> 03:20:51,348
[SPEAKER_09]: the professional development day on November 7th, and the common planning time and the instructional leadership teams that happened during the school day, all of that time is devoted to this work.

1416
03:20:53,449 --> 03:20:54,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1417
03:20:56,171 --> 03:20:59,554
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may, through the chair, I just want to really stress that

1418
03:21:00,356 --> 03:21:09,500
[SPEAKER_03]: The new elementary schedule allows for common planning time on a weekly basis, and that never existed before in Medford.

1419
03:21:10,040 --> 03:21:27,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a critical lever, a critical tool that if you're able to meet weekly with your grade level peers and look at data, look at student work, bring different writing samples, compare, use rubrics,

1420
03:21:27,868 --> 03:21:35,491
[SPEAKER_03]: conduct the learning walks, all of that is the critically important instructional work that moves the needle forward.

1421
03:21:35,971 --> 03:21:46,936
[SPEAKER_03]: And if those things aren't happening, if ILTs are not able to meet because the schedule doesn't allow for it, you're not going to be able to go back and do all of that important

1422
03:21:47,478 --> 03:21:48,199
[SPEAKER_03]: reteaching.

1423
03:21:48,739 --> 03:22:00,232
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was so happy that we were able to make the elementary schedule work and to use larger blocks of time to provide quality professional development.

1424
03:22:00,852 --> 03:22:01,012
[SPEAKER_03]: So

1425
03:22:02,193 --> 03:22:24,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, even though we are on par with the state, I agree with you, we should not be satisfied at that point and that we want to perform so much better and we can, but now we have new systems and structures in place where it's going to create the best learning opportunities for our educators to learn from one another.

1426
03:22:24,989 --> 03:22:33,894
[SPEAKER_03]: and to receive quality planning meetings, quality grade level team meetings, and using data to inform instruction.

1427
03:22:34,035 --> 03:22:39,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It just, it didn't work under the old schedule and now it is able to work.

1428
03:22:39,618 --> 03:22:43,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be able to do so much more as a district.

1429
03:22:43,920 --> 03:22:44,181
Thank you.

1430
03:22:46,542 --> 03:22:47,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Edmund-Vincent.

1431
03:22:48,183 --> 03:22:48,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

1432
03:22:50,344 --> 03:22:50,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1433
03:22:52,346 --> 03:22:52,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the

1434
03:22:54,099 --> 03:22:55,980
[SPEAKER_06]: report in fair time tonight.

1435
03:22:56,760 --> 03:23:02,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I had some questions specific to the, I mean, I think we've been talking about the equity issue for some time.

1436
03:23:02,904 --> 03:23:17,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do agree with my colleague around having some of the narrative of the data, some sort of qualitative narrative of the quantitative data would be really helpful for the community as well.

1437
03:23:18,605 --> 03:23:20,505
[SPEAKER_06]: in understanding the disparity.

1438
03:23:20,665 --> 03:23:27,027
[SPEAKER_06]: There's obviously a stark disparity in some of the numbers, especially based at the elementary level.

1439
03:23:27,087 --> 03:23:30,807
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think people would wanna know why.

1440
03:23:31,347 --> 03:23:41,509
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also I think it sort of can help dispel some of the notions that some schools are better than others or what have you, which is not the case.

1441
03:23:42,869 --> 03:23:46,490
[SPEAKER_06]: And so really being able to help folks understand that I think would be really helpful

1442
03:23:47,442 --> 03:23:56,390
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would also be helpful for us as we're thinking about what the budgeting priorities are across the district and what things look like in terms of if we're really talking about equity as a priority.

1443
03:23:57,131 --> 03:24:01,815
[SPEAKER_06]: As we've said many times before, equity is not that everybody gets the same, it's that everybody gets what they need.

1444
03:24:02,956 --> 03:24:05,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, with that in mind, really thinking about that.

1445
03:24:06,740 --> 03:24:13,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Regarding the instructional priorities, I'm wondering if there's any, I know there's high quality instructional development

1446
03:24:14,104 --> 03:24:24,431
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, data-informed decision-making you're talking about, is there any PD being offered around differentiation of materials or universal design for learning?

1447
03:24:26,853 --> 03:24:34,838
[SPEAKER_20]: So I guess what I would say is that is, that is and should be embedded in all of the PD that we do.

1448
03:24:35,639 --> 03:24:43,364
[SPEAKER_20]: But what I will say is for our secondary, for our secondary staff, we have contracted with Mantra Education Partners

1449
03:24:43,834 --> 03:24:50,057
[SPEAKER_20]: So we've been working with our consultant, and the goal is to look at data, and in this case, qualitative data.

1450
03:24:50,077 --> 03:24:51,397
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're looking at student work.

1451
03:24:52,878 --> 03:24:59,420
[SPEAKER_20]: That is gonna be, that is an initiative that we are undertaking this year, and it'll extend into next year.

1452
03:24:59,860 --> 03:25:13,606
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that, with the dialogues, the dialogue that's going to take place between facilitators of each one of those sessions in the schools, in the departments, that is a really important part of what we're talking about.

1453
03:25:14,046 --> 03:25:15,768
[SPEAKER_20]: How are the assessments created?

1454
03:25:16,208 --> 03:25:17,610
[SPEAKER_20]: How are the projects created?

1455
03:25:17,950 --> 03:25:20,752
[SPEAKER_20]: Do they take into consideration the different needs of students?

1456
03:25:21,293 --> 03:25:26,498
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's a very important component of what that PD is about.

1457
03:25:27,378 --> 03:25:33,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so what I'm hearing you say is that that's part of all of the trainings, but nothing specific to differentiation or universal design.

1458
03:25:36,871 --> 03:25:39,533
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not titled that, but it's embedded in.

1459
03:25:40,233 --> 03:25:46,736
[SPEAKER_20]: It's so important that it's included in almost all of the PD that we do.

1460
03:25:47,076 --> 03:25:54,080
[SPEAKER_20]: We wouldn't demonstrate, we wouldn't teach teachers an approach without embedding that in.

1461
03:25:54,100 --> 03:25:58,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1462
03:25:58,962 --> 03:26:05,125
[SPEAKER_06]: The weekly meetings at the grade level,

1463
03:26:05,985 --> 03:26:08,587
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the new schedule sort of, especially at the elementary.

1464
03:26:09,748 --> 03:26:19,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Are those meetings with all staff, teachers, all teaching staff, so general education and special education together, or are they segregated?

1465
03:26:20,116 --> 03:26:23,218
[SPEAKER_09]: And E.L.?

1466
03:26:23,338 --> 03:26:33,406
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little bit of both, depending on the time, because there are time constraints in terms of the schedule at the elementary level, because the buildings are a responsive classroom.

1467
03:26:35,171 --> 03:26:40,474
[SPEAKER_09]: that the first block of the day is when all staff are available to have those meetings.

1468
03:26:40,995 --> 03:26:44,477
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's an and in both.

1469
03:26:46,198 --> 03:26:51,681
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not common planning time if it's not everybody, right?

1470
03:26:51,861 --> 03:27:04,029
[SPEAKER_09]: The morning block is used and then the grade level teams are meeting during their grade level time and not all special education or EL or reading can attend at those times because they're servicing students.

1471
03:27:05,455 --> 03:27:05,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1472
03:27:06,856 --> 03:27:10,357
[SPEAKER_06]: So it sounds like we have work to do there as well in terms of it.

1473
03:27:11,358 --> 03:27:29,387
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're really talking equity and we're really talking common planning time and we're really talking everybody together, then it sounds to me like we need to think about what a schedule looks like so that people are working together and being able to, we have expertise in the district around differentiation and universal design and all of the things that could be incorporated.

1474
03:27:29,807 --> 03:27:33,469
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they're not meeting together to be able to have some common

1475
03:27:34,144 --> 03:27:35,464
[SPEAKER_06]: basis and understanding of that.

1476
03:27:35,484 --> 03:27:42,726
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like it's a missed opportunity, especially as we're talking about the instructional walks and what have you.

1477
03:27:42,786 --> 03:27:45,746
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, are the instructional walks happening in all of the classrooms?

1478
03:27:45,806 --> 03:27:47,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we seeing this in the EL?

1479
03:27:47,067 --> 03:27:49,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we seeing it in all of the different settings?

1480
03:27:49,487 --> 03:27:50,667
[SPEAKER_06]: And if so, by whom?

1481
03:27:50,687 --> 03:27:53,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I would wanna better understand.

1482
03:27:53,408 --> 03:28:03,250
[SPEAKER_06]: And then lastly, I guess I would just ask, I'm very much interested in the scope and scale

1483
03:28:04,002 --> 03:28:19,666
[SPEAKER_06]: of the professional development in the district, not so much to be obviously in the weeds with the superintendent's position or anybody else's position in terms of staffing, but more as a, where are we going and what are we understanding and what is happening?

1484
03:28:20,126 --> 03:28:24,167
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like as a school committee member, it's never been entirely clear.

1485
03:28:24,187 --> 03:28:31,129
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some years with phone calls and multiple conversations, it's been a little bit more clear about what professional development is being offered.

1486
03:28:31,598 --> 03:28:34,220
[SPEAKER_06]: but generally as a school committee member, I don't understand.

1487
03:28:34,821 --> 03:28:40,846
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no sort of, it's not like we get an understanding or a list of, hey, here's the professional development that's being offered this year.

1488
03:28:41,366 --> 03:28:45,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if that's an option because I think it helps us better understand.

1489
03:28:45,810 --> 03:28:46,871
[SPEAKER_09]: We can do that easily.

1490
03:28:47,111 --> 03:28:48,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be really helpful.

1491
03:28:48,372 --> 03:28:48,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1492
03:28:50,714 --> 03:28:58,040
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, I guess I would just say again, going back to the, and I'd be curious about what staff in the teaching,

1493
03:28:59,397 --> 03:29:10,704
[SPEAKER_06]: both staff and paraprofessionals and others have to say about the common planning piece, because I wonder if we're, again, not missing an opportunity for expertise on both ends to be able to be thinking about that.

1494
03:29:10,784 --> 03:29:11,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thank you.

1495
03:29:14,606 --> 03:29:15,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1496
03:29:15,747 --> 03:29:16,928
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all for the presentation.

1497
03:29:16,948 --> 03:29:17,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1498
03:29:17,428 --> 03:29:18,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Much appreciated.

1499
03:29:18,069 --> 03:29:22,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Member Ruseau.

1500
03:29:23,052 --> 03:29:27,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I did look to see if your mic was read and it was not at the top.

1501
03:29:28,968 --> 03:29:29,828
[SPEAKER_17]: I kept bumping it.

1502
03:29:34,390 --> 03:29:35,230
[SPEAKER_17]: So many questions.

1503
03:29:38,871 --> 03:29:45,053
[SPEAKER_17]: On slide five, I just wanted to state the obvious.

1504
03:29:45,953 --> 03:29:49,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Dessie's idea of who needs assistance is really quite a statement.

1505
03:29:50,435 --> 03:29:51,475
[SPEAKER_17]: We're down to 32% for the high school.

1506
03:29:54,974 --> 03:30:06,165
[SPEAKER_17]: for our percentile ranking and they don't think that requires assistance, just to never miss an opportunity to point out Dessie's idea of what their job is.

1507
03:30:07,226 --> 03:30:12,911
[SPEAKER_17]: Not what we on a school committee think our job is and certainly not what the district staff thinks their job is either.

1508
03:30:12,931 --> 03:30:19,578
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know any other setting or environment where 32% and they're like, things are cool.

1509
03:30:22,928 --> 03:30:28,289
[SPEAKER_17]: I just had to kind of just say that out loud, because it's just so obnoxious.

1510
03:30:29,749 --> 03:30:33,550
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a comment on anybody who works here.

1511
03:30:34,510 --> 03:30:44,092
[SPEAKER_17]: The 10th grade, 7th grade too, but 10th grade just seems to across the board have taken a hit everywhere you looked.

1512
03:30:45,073 --> 03:30:50,694
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have a 10th grader, so not that I don't care about all the students, but they did jump out at me.

1513
03:30:54,315 --> 03:30:59,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there working theories that you all have at this point as to how in the heck this happened?

1514
03:30:59,137 --> 03:31:03,178
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, 61% down to 39%.

1515
03:31:04,279 --> 03:31:14,722
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that's, I mean, that's, I think that has to be unprecedented in all of the time we've ever done data with MCAS since it was initially created.

1516
03:31:15,703 --> 03:31:15,883
[SPEAKER_17]: And

1517
03:31:20,219 --> 03:31:23,521
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that you have a lot of work ahead to figure this stuff out.

1518
03:31:23,621 --> 03:31:41,774
[SPEAKER_14]: There was something that, if we're going back to your theory of the state, which I agree with, our actual improvement on chronic absenteeism went up, like we got above the targets that were given.

1519
03:31:41,894 --> 03:31:43,275
[SPEAKER_14]: So we were trying to see like,

1520
03:31:44,363 --> 03:31:47,926
[SPEAKER_14]: was the absentee rate part of something that was there.

1521
03:31:48,286 --> 03:32:02,437
[SPEAKER_14]: I still, again, in looking, what I'm looking at individually when I take, God, school brains, and I look at the absenteeism and kind of compare it by student by student, obviously you can't bring that up right now, right?

1522
03:32:02,457 --> 03:32:03,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's individual students.

1523
03:32:03,798 --> 03:32:12,445
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think a little bit has to do with it, even though the state, like you just said, said, hey, you guys did awesome on your chronic absenteeism.

1524
03:32:12,944 --> 03:32:15,906
[SPEAKER_14]: you met above the target that we set for you.

1525
03:32:16,106 --> 03:32:20,309
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we were trying to, to look at that piece of it.

1526
03:32:20,369 --> 03:32:27,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause you know, in my mind, you know, absence instruction causes, you know, an absent achievement there.

1527
03:32:27,534 --> 03:32:28,214
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure.

1528
03:32:28,674 --> 03:32:28,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1529
03:32:28,935 --> 03:32:42,684
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, if you, you'll obviously spend more time on this particular piece of information because it's just such a stark and startling of all of the data that is, can be upsetting.

1530
03:32:44,180 --> 03:32:47,001
[SPEAKER_17]: There's just no example of something like that happening.

1531
03:32:47,602 --> 03:33:01,811
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, we did not have like a massive turnover in our math teachers or anything like, you know, so I just could not let that piece of data not get commented on.

1532
03:33:01,831 --> 03:33:03,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just add one thing to that as well?

1533
03:33:04,353 --> 03:33:11,638
[SPEAKER_00]: So having my own freshman, I did notice that the state has said that come next year,

1534
03:33:13,840 --> 03:33:26,504
[SPEAKER_00]: competency determination will revert back to its original way it was, meaning that state has given a lot of grace to the last year's sophomores and current seniors, right?

1535
03:33:26,524 --> 03:33:29,365
[SPEAKER_00]: So our current juniors, our current seniors because of COVID.

1536
03:33:29,465 --> 03:33:34,387
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what we have certainly in English seen a decline in the high school and MCAS.

1537
03:33:35,507 --> 03:33:39,569
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what will be interesting is the state saying next year,

1538
03:33:40,256 --> 03:33:43,742
[SPEAKER_00]: that competency determination will revert back to what it used to be.

1539
03:33:43,762 --> 03:33:49,571
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a message there about the impact of COVID, which cannot obviously be ignored.

1540
03:33:50,532 --> 03:33:55,420
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was interesting to me to read that they're changing that back for the

1541
03:33:55,953 --> 03:33:57,514
[SPEAKER_00]: They have high hopes for the ninth graders.

1542
03:33:58,095 --> 03:33:58,555
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I did.

1543
03:33:58,575 --> 03:34:01,357
[SPEAKER_17]: I watched the board meeting where that decision was made.

1544
03:34:01,717 --> 03:34:03,878
[SPEAKER_17]: And of course, I hadn't seen any of this.

1545
03:34:04,099 --> 03:34:04,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1546
03:34:05,279 --> 03:34:05,540
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1547
03:34:05,680 --> 03:34:17,528
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, if they stick to their guns, then we're going to have a graduation rate that across the state, frankly, that will, you know, be front page news and be

1548
03:34:18,953 --> 03:34:34,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Parents will bring their pitchforks, a huge percentage of our... Right now, 66% of our students are going to get a diploma because getting all the other competencies is fine, but if you can't get the math one, then it's the same as getting none.

1549
03:34:35,860 --> 03:34:41,402
[SPEAKER_17]: And the idea that a third of our students would not get a diploma, I mean, I can't imagine the...

1550
03:34:42,236 --> 03:34:43,676
[SPEAKER_17]: the firestorm that would ensue.

1551
03:34:46,617 --> 03:34:47,858
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it too soon to know?

1552
03:34:47,918 --> 03:34:53,519
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, because we're talking about 10th graders and people generally are not dropping out of school in 10th grade.

1553
03:34:54,880 --> 03:34:57,941
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's too soon to kind of know how that will go.

1554
03:34:58,341 --> 03:35:11,865
[SPEAKER_17]: I did have a question about the graduation rate since I probably could find this out on the internet, but if a student gets a certificate of attendance, but not a diploma,

1555
03:35:12,352 --> 03:35:15,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Do they count as a graduate in our graduation rates?

1556
03:35:15,874 --> 03:35:16,735
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good question.

1557
03:35:18,036 --> 03:35:18,716
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think they do.

1558
03:35:19,717 --> 03:35:24,520
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I wish that wasn't a thing, but I just wanted to make sure it wasn't a guess.

1559
03:35:24,560 --> 03:35:26,101
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going by my experience.

1560
03:35:26,221 --> 03:35:29,743
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a rarity of someone getting a certificate.

1561
03:35:30,664 --> 03:35:41,211
[SPEAKER_14]: We push hard to make sure that everyone's making competency determination, whether it was the EPP, like we just stated, whether it was the retest,

1562
03:35:42,000 --> 03:35:59,511
[SPEAKER_14]: And even during that time, Member Ruseau, we were also finding classes, I know, within their electives, which stinks, in a sense, because you're losing an elective, but we have to give you some remedial time to work on things so that you can make that test when you retest it.

1563
03:36:01,212 --> 03:36:08,076
[SPEAKER_14]: When I looked at the graduation rate about a couple weeks ago, and it's in the accountability part,

1564
03:36:09,608 --> 03:36:14,552
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we were like 90 something, 90 something percent.

1565
03:36:14,852 --> 03:36:23,860
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have it exactly in front of me, but I know- Yeah, I'm not particularly worried about it right now because our current seniors and juniors do not have the same requirements.

1566
03:36:23,880 --> 03:36:25,681
[SPEAKER_14]: And they'll have that opportunity to try.

1567
03:36:25,721 --> 03:36:38,232
[SPEAKER_14]: And then also remember, and again, not to go through it, but there were times too that we also had students in the competency determination window, where during COVID, if they had a certain course,

1568
03:36:38,976 --> 03:36:46,983
[SPEAKER_14]: that made the competency determination, the state accepted that because, but that is slowly faded away.

1569
03:36:47,443 --> 03:36:58,912
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and a lot of the time too, we talked about, um, science was not even a requirement during a few years of the pandemic, which understandably so, but now it's being brought back.

1570
03:36:59,052 --> 03:37:04,537
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think the state is trying to shift back to as normal as possible.

1571
03:37:05,237 --> 03:37:06,859
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess that's why I was saying like 2022, 23 data,

1572
03:37:09,344 --> 03:37:20,191
[SPEAKER_14]: is starting to seem more of a baseline because we're getting back, well, the state is wanting more than what we had previously a few years ago.

1573
03:37:20,692 --> 03:37:33,440
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, I don't want us to be here all night, but I mean, if, you know, come spring, we have reason to panic as a body, you know, like we should be like,

1574
03:37:35,026 --> 03:38:03,066
[SPEAKER_17]: putting, taking PTO from our day jobs to go hunt down legislators if we need to kind of like, it'd be good to hear that before when you get the sense that like, look, you know, we have a sense of why absenteeism of course is a pretty good place to look, but it's, you know, the regulation stuff that member Hays brought up, there's just, there's lots of things that it could be, but I just do not want to be sitting on this body and having,

1575
03:38:03,726 --> 03:38:11,750
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, hundreds of kids not get diplomas, it will be a very fun experience for them, obviously.

1576
03:38:12,991 --> 03:38:18,814
[SPEAKER_17]: But it will not be anything anybody, educators or committee members want to experience.

1577
03:38:18,854 --> 03:38:20,935
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

1578
03:38:20,955 --> 03:38:24,137
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna address the 39% and the 61%.

1579
03:38:24,177 --> 03:38:24,997
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember that

1580
03:38:34,641 --> 03:38:37,383
[SPEAKER_15]: you had mentioned that there was not a huge turnover.

1581
03:38:37,463 --> 03:38:47,909
[SPEAKER_15]: There were actually two teachers who were teaching geometry, the MCAS subject that year that left very late and we had to hire.

1582
03:38:49,110 --> 03:38:54,834
[SPEAKER_15]: So one person left in June and the schedules were set by then as to who will be teaching what.

1583
03:38:55,374 --> 03:39:03,319
[SPEAKER_15]: And the other teacher, a very seasoned teacher, had went on a maternity leave and never came back.

1584
03:39:04,385 --> 03:39:08,606
[SPEAKER_15]: So those two teachers were teaching geometry out of the five.

1585
03:39:09,706 --> 03:39:30,932
[SPEAKER_15]: A couple of sections who had a huge mix of ninth and 10th and 11th grade geometries where there is a huge pedagogical difference between you teaching a ninth grader geometry who are more on the advanced track versus 10th grade who are on their track and then the 11th grade.

1586
03:39:32,513 --> 03:39:37,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Many scheduling shifts took place and we had a few sections of those.

1587
03:39:38,498 --> 03:39:43,162
[SPEAKER_15]: We were advised not to do it, but we had to for several reasons.

1588
03:39:43,262 --> 03:39:54,231
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are the reasons that I can, I knew going into this year that this will be the case.

1589
03:39:54,291 --> 03:39:57,914
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hoping that next year will be better.

1590
03:39:57,934 --> 03:40:00,616
[SPEAKER_15]: And because we have looked at those,

1591
03:40:01,656 --> 03:40:04,138
[SPEAKER_15]: provided the professional development to the teachers.

1592
03:40:04,158 --> 03:40:07,640
[SPEAKER_15]: We are looking at data together more and more to avoid that.

1593
03:40:07,780 --> 03:40:10,582
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm hoping for better results next year.

1594
03:40:11,062 --> 03:40:11,303
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1595
03:40:11,503 --> 03:40:11,903
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1596
03:40:12,143 --> 03:40:17,367
[SPEAKER_17]: And can't you just print some new teachers and those hard to find subjects?

1597
03:40:19,808 --> 03:40:20,689
[SPEAKER_17]: That and chemistry.

1598
03:40:21,229 --> 03:40:24,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1599
03:40:25,552 --> 03:40:26,453
[SPEAKER_17]: And those were filled.

1600
03:40:26,473 --> 03:40:27,514
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, great.

1601
03:40:27,634 --> 03:40:28,054
[SPEAKER_17]: Wonderful.

1602
03:40:28,094 --> 03:40:28,394

[SPEAKER_10]: We do not have any presentations of the public.

1608
03:40:39,791 --> 03:40:55,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it's nine o'clock and we've been at it since five, but let's just see which resolutions we need to get through tonight due to the next meeting being canceled because it's day before election day and there'll be voting activity in the chambers.

1609

1680
03:45:43,798 --> 03:45:47,000

1681
03:45:47,020 --> 03:45:47,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1682
03:45:47,220 --> 03:45:48,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

1683
03:45:50,970 --> 03:45:58,232
[SPEAKER_05]: want to say thank you to the folks who put this together because I think it's really important and I want to see us pass it.

1684
03:45:58,992 --> 03:46:18,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I had some comments that are just more about sort of sustainability of our the policy itself and maybe some suggestions but I was just curious if the idea was that this could was going to go to subcommittee or how we want to navigate through this because it is

1685
03:46:19,119 --> 03:46:19,900
[SPEAKER_05]: very long.

1686
03:46:20,780 --> 03:46:26,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Um and I just want to be mindful of the fact that it's already 905 and we have been at this since five o'clock.

1687
03:46:27,025 --> 03:46:38,655
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um II don't want to delay the implementation of the policy but I do think there are some things um that I'd like to see change slightly.

1688
03:46:38,755 --> 03:46:46,701
[SPEAKER_05]: So, can we, maybe we can just talk about like proceed how we're going to navigate through this whether it's tonight or or some other time.

1689
03:46:46,942 --> 03:46:47,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Does

1690
03:46:49,062 --> 03:46:58,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was just gonna say, is there an option for waiving the reading as it would be the first reading?

1691
03:47:00,405 --> 03:47:04,786
[SPEAKER_06]: And then obviously it's posted and it's public for folks who wanna read it.

1692
03:47:04,946 --> 03:47:13,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And then coming back to the next meeting for the second meeting within the meantime, potentially member

1693
03:47:14,435 --> 03:47:40,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Graham offering the majority of this was written well this was written by member Hays who did an excellent job I would have to say in so many ways but perhaps feedback could be offered directly to member Hays so that it's not a quorum or open meeting violation and then that can be considered at the second reading or no I'm not sure of the process but member Rousseau seems to be so

1694
03:47:42,873 --> 03:47:43,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, member Rousseau.

1695
03:47:44,214 --> 03:47:45,856
[SPEAKER_17]: The second reading, it can't be changed.

1696
03:47:45,876 --> 03:47:47,618
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to be changed to the first reading.

1697
03:47:47,938 --> 03:47:55,206
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, we can have the second reading, but then if we change it, it becomes another first reading.

1698
03:47:55,606 --> 03:47:56,046
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's.

1699
03:47:57,128 --> 03:48:01,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there, I guess we could send it to Committee of the Whole to make it a little faster.

1700
03:48:02,653 --> 03:48:05,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Could it, could there be a meeting with just one topic?

1701
03:48:06,462 --> 03:48:07,042
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you pleased?

1702
03:48:07,703 --> 03:48:10,264
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, one, I mean, a school committee just meeting.

1703
03:48:10,284 --> 03:48:19,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like, could we have a committee of the whole or something with just one topic so it does not start at five and end at 10 sometime soon?

1704
03:48:19,608 --> 03:48:20,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1705
03:48:21,189 --> 03:48:35,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have some like sort of overarching comments that would require some changes to the policy, but they're not, I don't think they're particularly like problematic or changing the spirit of what is here.

1706
03:48:35,851 --> 03:48:41,315
[SPEAKER_05]: it's more about just I don't know.

1707
03:48:41,415 --> 03:48:41,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Maintenance.

1708
03:48:42,216 --> 03:48:43,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we only have one meeting in November.

1709
03:48:43,697 --> 03:48:53,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I I just don't know if can we just sort of talk about what our thoughts are and maybe another iteration of this can come forward next time that we can pass.

1710
03:48:53,363 --> 03:48:54,004
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't I don't know.

1711
03:48:54,064 --> 03:48:56,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what the best path forward is.

1712
03:49:02,810 --> 03:49:03,090
[SPEAKER_10]: member

1713
03:49:06,055 --> 03:49:11,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I mean, I don't have any concerns, obviously, with the intent at all, but there's formatting issues.

1714
03:49:11,277 --> 03:49:20,700
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a sentence that says, take the following steps, and then immediately afterwards are definitions, which were clearly inserted in a place that wasn't the right place to insert them.

1715
03:49:21,180 --> 03:49:23,281
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't have any problems with the definitions.

1716
03:49:23,301 --> 03:49:27,322
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just that as it reads, it would not make sense as a policy.

1717
03:49:27,382 --> 03:49:34,645
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think a half an hour, 40 minute, 45 minute committee of the whole will be done.

1718
03:49:36,696 --> 03:49:41,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I see the superintendent looking at me like you met this committee, have you met yourself.

1719
03:49:42,759 --> 03:50:05,349
[SPEAKER_17]: So I mean, but a one item agenda we've done that before, and it has been quick because we well I mean we're not probably going to get together and be like, we don't think we should do this policy that that's, you know, that makes it a long meeting, but I also think that there's probably nothing wrong or a violation for us to just send our comments off to member Hays, and

1720
03:50:06,437 --> 03:50:18,685
[SPEAKER_17]: And as long as we don't have a dialogue response that, you know, here's what we think, and then you make the changes and don't email us back so that we don't violate open meeting law is probably fine too.

1721
03:50:19,326 --> 03:50:23,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Although the numbers for employers, so I could go either way.

1722
03:50:23,969 --> 03:50:32,395
[SPEAKER_10]: If we do a doodle poll and try to get it done before November 7th or right after, would people be amenable to having an hour, hour and a half

1723
03:50:33,354 --> 03:50:36,477
[SPEAKER_10]: the whole meeting, even if it's by Zoom, just to focus on this policy alone.

1724
03:50:37,718 --> 03:50:41,681
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we can vote it out in the meeting in November and get it approved.

1725
03:50:43,402 --> 03:50:48,747
[SPEAKER_17]: I just have the school committee conference the morning after the election, which is the best timing for that.

1726
03:50:48,847 --> 03:50:53,030
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I have November 1st available.

1727
03:50:53,671 --> 03:50:54,872
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin?

1728
03:50:55,252 --> 03:51:02,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was wondering if it would, you know, I'd like to hear from Member Hays, if possible, since she put a ton of work into this.

1729
03:51:03,422 --> 03:51:06,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I really appreciate all of the work in it.

1730
03:51:06,683 --> 03:51:12,384
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would just love to hear what your position, what Member Hays' position.

1731
03:51:13,525 --> 03:51:15,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Member Hays, thank you for drafting.

1732
03:51:16,425 --> 03:51:16,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1733
03:51:16,926 --> 03:51:21,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, this body works as a team.

1734
03:51:21,707 --> 03:51:29,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there are questions about it, and we're feeling that it would be too rushed to do it now, I think it feels like there's a number of members who feel that way.

1735
03:51:30,504 --> 03:51:40,992
[SPEAKER_04]: So as much as I obviously had hoped to get this done tonight, it's unfortunate that it was the last thing on the agenda on a very busy night where there were really two, a meeting and a half squished together.

1736
03:51:42,694 --> 03:51:46,016
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's fine with me if we want to look for a committee of the whole toward it.

1737
03:51:46,076 --> 03:51:47,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Commissioner Laughlin.

1738
03:51:47,658 --> 03:51:48,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table.

1739
03:51:50,820 --> 03:51:51,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Till committee of the whole.

1740
03:51:55,864 --> 03:51:56,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table.

1741
03:51:56,905 --> 03:51:59,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I guess to second motion.

1742
03:52:01,348 --> 03:52:02,989
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we don't need to table it.

1743
03:52:03,049 --> 03:52:07,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, a motion to send it to the Committee of the Whole.

1744
03:52:08,333 --> 03:52:08,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

1745
03:52:11,635 --> 03:52:16,539
[SPEAKER_10]: One seconded by, I missed that, Member Graham.

1746
03:52:16,579 --> 03:52:17,259
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

1747
03:52:17,279 --> 03:52:18,000
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1748
03:52:18,160 --> 03:52:18,920
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1749
03:52:20,261 --> 03:52:21,062
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

1750
03:52:21,342 --> 03:52:23,644
[SPEAKER_10]: We will get to the Doodle poll tomorrow.

1751
03:52:23,884 --> 03:52:29,328
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also say maybe in the Doodle poll, we can figure out which committee members may have comments

1752
03:52:29,841 --> 03:52:32,982
[SPEAKER_05]: where they feel like they need to be available for the meeting.

1753
03:52:33,022 --> 03:52:37,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are committee members who don't feel like they have comments and it doesn't work for their schedule.

1754
03:52:38,004 --> 03:52:42,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we just know that so we can find a time that gets this prioritized.

1755
03:52:43,506 --> 03:52:44,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Great idea.

1756
03:52:46,707 --> 03:52:47,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

1757
03:52:48,248 --> 03:52:50,129
[SPEAKER_10]: We do not have any condolences.

1758
03:52:50,469 --> 03:52:55,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Our next meeting is November 6th is canceled due to the election.

1759
03:52:56,588 --> 03:52:57,849
[SPEAKER_10]: And the chambers being used.

1760
03:52:58,009 --> 03:53:13,034
[SPEAKER_10]: So our next meeting is November 20 November 20 which is Monday here in the chambers as well as on zoom motion to adjourn by member McLaughlin seconded by
