Councilor Lango-Kearns.

21
00:11:02,921 --> 00:11:04,142
Thank you, President Carviello.

22
00:11:04,482 --> 00:11:07,403
We do have a resident that would like a few minutes to speak.

23
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:10,265
I know it's give us an update on what's going on in the neighborhood.

24
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:14,907
Name and address of the record, please.

25
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:16,528
Yes, my name is Farina Buller.

26
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:18,789
I live at 9 Alfred Street in Medford.

27
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:25,673
I was here a couple of weeks ago and I just like to personally thank everybody here for getting this ball rolling in the right direction.

28
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,474
I had a positive attitude about this.

29
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:31,376
We got a cease and desist order.

30
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:39,926
and I thought we were gonna give this thing a nice nap and have a nice Christmas, but unfortunately, I have some bad news.

31
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:45,628
First of all, nothing has stopped, okay?

32
00:11:45,768 --> 00:11:53,890
They continually work, and I have the documentation, the videos, they have continually worked for every Saturday since I've been here.

33
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,871
I had the Memphis Police come by on a Saturday, December 9th,

34
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:09,758
door wide open, grinding, counselors, Scapelli here, drove by, luckily he just told me, and saw them working on a Saturday.

35
00:12:10,498 --> 00:12:20,145
So it's been very frustrating, and I know things aren't gonna happen in one day, two days, so I didn't wanna come here a week later, I figured I'd wait a week or so to see what's going on.

36
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:23,489
Well, things have gotten progressively worse over there.

37
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:34,806
They're still coming in early in the morning, but now what they do is they park their cars around the other side of the building because thinking that I don't see any cars there that, you know, they're not working.

38
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:54,073
Another problem I have is I went down to the building commissioner's office today, and what I wanted was some clarification on a cease and desist order, which I looked up in the dictionary, it says stop work.

39
00:12:54,813 --> 00:12:56,793
I'm not an attorney, I'm just saying that.

40
00:12:57,294 --> 00:13:04,516
So Mr. Motley wasn't there, but when I went there today, John Bufuso was there.

41
00:13:05,596 --> 00:13:06,977
And I asked him a few questions.

42
00:13:07,778 --> 00:13:12,440
My first question was, do you have a copy of the cease and desist order?

43
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:14,622
I don't have it.

44
00:13:15,022 --> 00:13:16,843
I said, well, you know who has it?

45
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,204
He says, Paul has.

46
00:13:18,224 --> 00:13:19,525
Can you guys speak to Paul?

47
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:20,525
Paul ain't in right now.

48
00:13:21,446 --> 00:13:25,648
And then I asked him for some clarification, which, you know, really concerns me.

49
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:28,730
And he said, Paul isn't here.

50
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:31,172
So I was a little aggravated at this point.

51
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:39,136
because I took time off of my work, not that I get paid millions of dollars, but I took time out of my day to go over it just to get something resolved.

52
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:50,881
I went up to the mayor's office, unannounced, which I don't blame her, she was in a meeting, sorry, but she couldn't speak to me, that's totally understandable, I didn't even expect to see her, I just wanted to let her know I was there.

53
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:57,805
She was nice enough to have called Mr. Moakley, who I just left the office, wasn't in, came right up.

54
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:01,446
I try to get some clarification on this.

55
00:14:02,306 --> 00:14:04,206
He couldn't give me a straight answer on anything.

56
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:08,327
Everything's kind of like a riddle to me on the answers I got back.

57
00:14:09,027 --> 00:14:12,948
One of the things that really, I need a clarification on this.

58
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:17,369
I have this paper here from the Board of Appeals that was written, okay?

59
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:28,552
And I highlighted what it says because I keep getting the wording that, oh, this, even though it was written to Steve Nardone, it's transferable to the tenant who's over there.

60
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:36,156
Okay, and with that being said, I just want to go back a step.

61
00:14:36,697 --> 00:14:41,619
Mr. Moakley, in his words, agreed that this company, J.F.

62
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,061
White, is in violation of doing this type of work.

63
00:14:45,482 --> 00:14:47,283
Those are his words, okay?

64
00:14:48,003 --> 00:14:55,286
You know, this place was supposed to be for parking, for storage, not for industrial heavy-duty pipe manufacturing.

65
00:14:56,067 --> 00:15:11,094
But with that being said, what really bothered me was it says on the paper here, it says the Board of Appeals also calls the attention of the owner of the application that General Laws Chapter 48, Section 11, the last paragraph,

66
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:27,645
provides that no variance or special permits of any extension, modifications, or renewal, therefore, shall take effect until a copy of the decision bearing the certification of the town within 21 days of it being filed.

67
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:35,491
So, I'm not an attorney, but this pretty much sounds like this isn't transferable, okay?

68
00:15:36,692 --> 00:15:40,795
But what I'm asking you is why, when I come here,

69
00:15:42,337 --> 00:15:49,484
In front of you guys, you, excuse me, in front of everybody, you gave me the cease and desist order.

70
00:15:50,104 --> 00:16:04,578
Now Mr. Moakley tells me the cease and desist order was given, now he couldn't give me a copy of it, but he said it was no work will be allowed before five o'clock, I'm sorry, before eight o'clock in the morning and not after five o'clock in the afternoon.

71
00:16:05,844 --> 00:16:07,988
I mean, does that sound reasonable?

72
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:10,152
That's worse than useless.

73
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:13,498
Having somebody that's supposed to be a cease and desist means stop work.

74
00:16:13,978 --> 00:16:16,683
So you're saying they can only work between eight and five.

75
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:20,135
I don't know what to say.

76
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:26,477
You guys helped me out so much and now I'm up against this here and I don't understand the wording or any of this.

77
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:40,862
But it doesn't make no sense to me at all and most importantly I just want to say I have 40 people that I'm representing today that are not here because they don't even know I'm coming today because I don't have time today to go there and see all of them.

78
00:16:41,182 --> 00:16:43,563
But they all support me and we're all together on this.

79
00:16:44,043 --> 00:16:45,484
And it's really aggravating that

80
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:48,246
A company, J.F.

81
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:50,588
White, can't find a place, and that's another thing.

82
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:52,189
I said, well when are they coming out?

83
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:52,970
When are they leaving?

84
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,811
He says, well they said by the end of February.

85
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:55,452
Do you have a date?

86
00:16:55,572 --> 00:16:55,792
No.

87
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:57,934
So again, we're at hearsay.

88
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:00,216
They're supposed to be out at the end of February.

89
00:17:00,576 --> 00:17:01,457
A company, J.F.

90
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:08,522
White, can't find a place to do a commercial business, heavy pipe manufacturing besides a residential neighborhood.

91
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:10,123
I'm not buying it.

92
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:28,007
And I need all of your support, maybe something we can do to get this resolved, because, you know, we have rights in this town, in this city, and our rights in my neighborhood, a residential neighborhood, are being violated on a daily basis.

93
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:35,488
And it's disgraceful, disgraceful, that I have to go down there and argue with somebody down in the building department,

94
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:40,491
John Bufuso told me they have a right to work on a Saturday.

95
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:41,991
I said, did you read the ordinance?

96
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:42,572
He goes, yeah.

97
00:17:43,012 --> 00:17:46,312
Five minutes later, I see Paul, he says, oh no, they can't work on a Saturday.

98
00:17:46,973 --> 00:17:49,053
I mean, does the left hand know what the right hand's doing?

99
00:17:49,073 --> 00:17:51,534
This is the guy that's been out there five times.

100
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,294
Five times he's been out there, he hasn't seen any work.

101
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:55,615
Hate to tell ya,

102
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,658
For the last two weeks, Winchester Street's been closed off.

103
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:01,619
No one can go up there, okay?

104
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:03,661
And the problem's on Alfred Street.

105
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:06,163
Read the paperwork, Alfred Street.

106
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,505
Not Winchester Street, that's where you enter it.

107
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:10,726
All the noise is coming out of Alfred Street.

108
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,389
So, I'm at wit's end here.

109
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:16,771
I don't know why a company

110
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:29,679
is coming into a town that did this to you to make money, do their pipe work, and get out, that they have no respect for the neighbors, no respect for the city, and why is the city allowing something like this to happen?

111
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,001
I don't get it, I don't get it.

112
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:36,744
And if you all can help me in some way, I very much appreciate it.

113
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,881
Through the Chair, if I could ask a question.

114
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:40,741
Council Member Kern.

115
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,862
Through the Chair, thank you, President Carviello.

116
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:48,483
So they're working six days a week with the door open, are they still doing work outside or is it closed?

117
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,184
Yes, they're still doing work outside.

118
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:59,267
I have video documentation and I'd just like to make it for the record that Mr. Moakley, I saw him up in the Mayor's office, I wanted to show him the video.

119
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,308
I said, well they're out there right now.

120
00:19:01,648 --> 00:19:03,608
You wanna see the video today at 1.30?

121
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:04,609
Here's some more grinding.

122
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:05,869
I mean, I don't wanna have to play this for ya.

123
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:07,229
I don't wanna see it.

124
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:08,430
Of course you don't wanna see it.

125
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:18,252
You know, I mean, how can you have a cease and desist order and say they can only work from eight to five?

126
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:22,973
Does that sound, seriously, I'm asking you all, does that sound fair or reasonable?

127
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:27,214
That's a slap in the face to me and the 40 other people that signed this paper.

128
00:19:31,497 --> 00:19:41,560
Through the chair, it seems to me our 40 neighbors that are dealing with this have a right to be very frustrated and to get a date of maybe February.

129
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:43,701
And if, not even something, if.

130
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:45,722
I said, so did they give you anything in stone?

131
00:19:46,202 --> 00:19:46,902
Well, they said.

132
00:19:46,922 --> 00:19:50,183
I go, so that's hearsay, you know, hearsay.

133
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,804
I mean, they're a big contractor.

134
00:19:52,284 --> 00:19:55,105
I don't even think they're aware of what's going on, to be honest with you.

135
00:19:55,405 --> 00:20:03,589
That's what I think, because I don't think a company that big would want to be embarrassed so much for making fools out of himself in a city, in a residential neighborhood.

136
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:05,530
I just can't believe it.

137
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,492
What I can believe is down at that building department that someone's not doing their job.

138
00:20:10,892 --> 00:20:18,876
How come he comes by and he sees it, and this guy comes by five times when the road's closed on Winchester Street, and he's never seen nothing?

139
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:23,142
I live next door, I'm not even home all day, and when I go home, that's all I see and hear.

140
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:27,168
So, you know, I'm not imagining anything, and neither are all the neighbors, you know?

141
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:37,228
I'd be happy to meet you here tomorrow at nine o'clock at the building office and go up there with you with the building inspector.

142
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:38,729
Well, thank you very much.

143
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:48,717
I just want to know that you're well respected by me and I find that everything you've done was being very disrespected and I just wanted you guys to acknowledge that.

144
00:20:49,237 --> 00:20:50,038
Thank you very much.

145
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:52,040
If you'd like to meet me here tomorrow morning when the office opens.

146
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,741
I'd be there at nine o'clock, no problem.

147
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:56,343
I'll meet you there the first thing in the morning and we'll go up there together.

148
00:20:56,683 --> 00:20:57,363
Thank you very much.

149
00:20:57,403 --> 00:20:58,604
Everybody have a nice Christmas.

150
00:20:58,644 --> 00:20:59,584
Thank you for your time.

151
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:02,525
I think we need to get some clarification from ourselves.

152
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:10,247
I know Paul's responded to me in the last week because I've had some of your neighbors actually call and email with additional complaints, like you're saying.

153
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:10,527
Right.

154
00:21:10,607 --> 00:21:11,867
It's work hasn't stopped.

155
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:14,848
It's going on at all hours, inside, outside.

156
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:20,731
I did ask a couple questions to the building department.

157
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:26,995
He did answer me back, but you're right, if we ask for a cease and desist, why are they allowed to operate?

158
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:37,082
More importantly, what I'm concerned, can anybody get a clarification on if this ordinance was specifically for Nardone Electric, okay?

159
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:39,984
And he doesn't operate the property.

160
00:21:40,564 --> 00:21:41,685
And it says right in here,

161
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:47,295
that this can't be changed by anything unless it's in 21 days of writing.

162
00:21:47,635 --> 00:21:48,536
How is this happening?

163
00:21:49,136 --> 00:21:49,976
I don't get it.

164
00:21:50,336 --> 00:21:52,137
I don't get that at all.

165
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:53,277
I'm not an attorney.

166
00:21:53,517 --> 00:22:04,480
Maybe we could give that to our messenger and get an opinion from our city solicitor, and if that's the case, if it's non-transferable, then the permit should be pulled, although we voted to cease and desist on this a couple weeks ago.

167
00:22:09,726 --> 00:22:14,469
The conclusion was reached some weeks ago by the building commissioner that it's not transferable.

168
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,730
He made that clear.

169
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,193
Those are the grounds under which he's issued the cease and desist.

170
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:20,194
He's told me otherwise.

171
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:34,749
uh, recommendation that, uh, we, uh, require the building commissioner to, uh, pursue this, uh, to the greatest extent, uh, the law allows him, uh, to, uh, uh, deal with it.

172
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:37,752
I mean, maybe you can work that out.

173
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:38,793
Thank you.

174
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:40,014
Thank you very much.

175
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:42,217
Um, Council, are you done?

176
00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:42,957
For now.

177
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:52,406
I was supporting my colleague when we talked about getting this to the city solicitor.

178
00:22:52,426 --> 00:22:54,789
I think that the message is clear.

179
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:56,130
I think that we've all spoken.

180
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,571
We support the neighbors.

181
00:22:58,492 --> 00:23:00,794
Like I said, we've seen the work and we've mentioned that.

182
00:23:00,834 --> 00:23:08,682
So I think that if we can do that, I know it's great that you can come out here tomorrow, but I think we need our legal team to work with our code enforcement

183
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:11,724
to make sure both of them are doing what's right.

184
00:23:11,804 --> 00:23:18,868
And if we need, then you need to get the chief of police involved and do what needs to be done for those residents.

185
00:23:19,068 --> 00:23:21,889
I think it's very important that all three entities are contacted.

186
00:23:25,131 --> 00:23:25,912
Vice President Mox.

187
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:27,873
Thank you, Mr. President.

188
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:32,217
I agree with my colleagues, but I'd like to take it one step further.

189
00:23:32,237 --> 00:23:46,028
I think we need to create an emergency committee of the whole meeting and meet with the city solicitor, as was mentioned, the building department, John Bavuso, and the building commissioner, Paul Moki, either meet on site or here at City Hall.

190
00:23:46,388 --> 00:23:52,173
I would prefer that we meet on site, Mr. President, and this needs to take place immediately.

191
00:23:52,754 --> 00:23:53,815
So, I would ask that

192
00:23:54,855 --> 00:23:59,920
I would ask that you set up an emergency meeting, Mr. President, to go on site.

193
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,244
This is, as Fran mentioned, this has been going on far too long.

194
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:11,111
I thought the cease and desist order, in my opinion, how it's always worked in this city, that stops all work.

195
00:24:11,471 --> 00:24:12,132
Exactly.

196
00:24:12,512 --> 00:24:15,635
That's why I couldn't understand why you would have a cease and desist from 8 to 5.

197
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:22,960
And the reason why you do that is to bring all parties to the table, because once you stop work, J.F.

198
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,862
White's going to say, what's going on?

199
00:24:25,302 --> 00:24:26,443
And they're going to want to be at the table.

200
00:24:26,523 --> 00:24:27,103
Exactly.

201
00:24:27,143 --> 00:24:34,909
If you allow them to do business as usual between those hours, because in my opinion, the city didn't do you any favors eight to five.

202
00:24:34,989 --> 00:24:36,109
Oh, you guys did your job.

203
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,711
I just want to tell you, I'm very happy.

204
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:43,535
And unfortunately, I waited and I knew it wasn't going to happen overnight, but nothing has changed.

205
00:24:43,655 --> 00:24:43,955
Nothing.

206
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:44,855
That's why I'm here.

207
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:47,416
I'm not here to ruin everybody's day.

208
00:24:47,756 --> 00:24:54,478
And our job is to make sure the residents have a peace of mind and a quality of life that they deserve.

209
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:59,139
So I would ask, Mr. President, that you call for that meeting immediately.

210
00:24:59,159 --> 00:24:59,820
Thank you, Mr. President.

211
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:02,691
Councilor Falco.

212
00:25:02,951 --> 00:25:04,273
Thank you, Mr. President.

213
00:25:04,353 --> 00:25:06,517
Brian, I thank you for coming down again to give us an update.

214
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:08,219
It's my pleasure, Mr. Falco.

215
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:12,666
You live in this neighborhood, you experience this on a daily basis, and this is a quality of life issue.

216
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:13,968
You shouldn't be impacted like this.

217
00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:14,348
Absolutely.

218
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:15,370
And your neighbors shouldn't either.

219
00:25:16,992 --> 00:25:18,312
You know, I agree with my colleagues.

220
00:25:18,372 --> 00:25:20,993
I think an emergency meeting is called for in this situation.

221
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:24,455
I mean, this is something that needs to stop and it needs to stop now.

222
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:30,577
The questions that I have and that I would like to hear back is why were the limitations put on the cease and desist order?

223
00:25:30,657 --> 00:25:34,258
Who actually put limitations saying between these hours and these hours?

224
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:35,999
I agree with my console colleague here.

225
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,999
Stop work means stop work.

226
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,420
That means shut it down.

227
00:25:40,677 --> 00:25:45,358
and that's what people react and that's what people come to the table to come up with some sort of a resolution.

228
00:25:46,198 --> 00:25:50,119
February, once you get to February, they're gonna say, well, we'll find a new place by March.

229
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,459
We'll find a new place by May.

230
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,659
Well, we've almost got a space, but I'm with you 100%.

231
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:55,160
Exactly.

232
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:07,522
So we need to make sure that the feet are put to the fire and make sure that they find a location, but to also make sure that they comply with the law and to make sure that you actually can live a nice quality life in your neighborhood.

233
00:26:07,802 --> 00:26:08,322
Thank you.

234
00:26:08,362 --> 00:26:08,982
So I'd like to know,

235
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:16,363
Who actually put limitations on the stop work order or the cease and desist order?

236
00:26:16,924 --> 00:26:19,284
And I also want to find out when it was issued.

237
00:26:19,584 --> 00:26:21,845
I know you came down and we actually counseled.

238
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:26,085
It was issued on a Thursday, two days after the meeting, which was the fifth on a Tuesday.

239
00:26:26,105 --> 00:26:27,646
I think it was issued on the seventh.

240
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,046
The seventh or the eighth.

241
00:26:29,206 --> 00:26:31,586
If we can just get confirmation on that.

242
00:26:32,307 --> 00:26:33,107
But I do agree.

243
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:39,669
Okay, then I do agree that an emergency meeting is warranted and we should be doing that.

244
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:40,490
Thank you.

245
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,151
Council Member O'Connor.

246
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:50,454
Through the Chair, when you say our code enforcement officer, he didn't make it to the site because the street was closed, is that what you're trying to say?

247
00:26:51,538 --> 00:27:05,086
What happened was, is I was, exactly, I went down to see when he was going, because I read his, first of all, I didn't call the newspaper, the newspaper called me and I was reading some of his comments in there.

248
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:08,809
And one of his comments were, it's a noise issue.

249
00:27:08,949 --> 00:27:10,530
It has a lot more to do with noise.

250
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,710
This is one of the problems.

251
00:27:12,011 --> 00:27:16,213
But I've been there on five separate occasions and I haven't seen any of them working.

252
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:20,276
So I went down to get some documentation on what days he was there.

253
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:24,640
And I got like, whoa, I went down, I couldn't get a straight answer.

254
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:32,648
But I can tell you that for the last two weeks on Winchester Street, they've had it shut down except for Saturdays because they're doing all the gas lines there.

255
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:34,249
So where did he go?

256
00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:35,811
He couldn't get up Winchester Street.

257
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:42,538
If he went down Alfred Street next to my house, he would see a door wide open with guys there grinding away, you know?

258
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:54,645
Through the chair, I think we need to maybe take a vote to cease and desist the business, go on record, all hours of the day.

259
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:57,285
Just cease and desist.

260
00:27:58,065 --> 00:28:05,327
We'll reiterate that we're asking our building department to issue another cease and desist for doing any work on the property, at the property.

261
00:28:05,347 --> 00:28:08,247
I don't know what we're going to do on a Saturday morning down there.

262
00:28:08,307 --> 00:28:09,767
I think it needs to start tomorrow.

263
00:28:09,827 --> 00:28:13,128
They need to be issued a cease and desist, bring them to the table sooner than that.

264
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:15,305
Thank you.

265
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:18,147
Friend, if you can give your phone number to Larry.

266
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:18,728
Yes.

267
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:21,130
And actually, if we can meet tomorrow at 8.30, I'll meet you at 8.30.

268
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,611
I'm on it like a hornet, I'll be there.

269
00:28:22,791 --> 00:28:25,733
I'll meet you at 8.30 tomorrow morning at the building department.

270
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:26,253
Okay.

271
00:28:27,014 --> 00:28:28,415
Thank you everybody, have a nice Christmas.

272
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:28,615
Thank you.

273
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:34,459
All right, motion to revert back to regular business?

274
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,080
So moved.

275
00:28:36,621 --> 00:28:38,402
So moved.

276
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,384
Mr. Clerk.

277
00:28:41,464 --> 00:28:43,025
The main motion,

278
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:52,154
And from Council, Falco is who put on the limitations on the cease and desist and when was it issued?

279
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:59,916
And amended by Councilor Longo-Pereira is to issue a cease and desist for all hours of operation.

280
00:29:00,976 --> 00:29:09,118
And then they also ask that the City Solicitor look into the question from the Council about the transferable policy.

281
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:10,138
Yeah, you have to get a decision.

282
00:29:10,158 --> 00:29:12,599
Emergency meeting, right?

283
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:14,179
Emergency meeting.

284
00:29:15,857 --> 00:29:19,121
It's not an emergency.

285
00:29:22,665 --> 00:29:24,066
It's tomorrow, if we can get one tomorrow night.

286
00:29:24,146 --> 00:29:25,007
It's tomorrow night, okay.

287
00:29:25,027 --> 00:29:27,510
We need to post it, we need 48 hours, right?

288
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,831
I'll see if I can do it for Thursday.

289
00:29:36,512 --> 00:29:44,314
All right, on the motion by Councilor Longo Kern, as amended by Councilor Falco.

290
00:29:44,494 --> 00:29:55,297
On the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Kern, and Councilor Mox.

291
00:29:56,457 --> 00:29:57,237
All those in favor?

292
00:29:58,178 --> 00:29:58,998
Motion passes.

293
00:30:01,398 --> 00:30:03,579
Motion to revert back to regular business.

294
00:30:05,868 --> 00:30:11,854
Motion orders and resolutions 17-800 offered by Councilor Lungo-Kern.

295
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:21,103
Be it resolved that the administration update the Memphis City Council on what locations snow has been stored over the last three years.

296
00:30:21,183 --> 00:30:22,164
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

297
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:23,986
Thank you, President Carviello.

298
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:27,769
We did ask for this resolve.

299
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:35,036
Back a few months ago when we were discussing, I brought up the issue of dumping snow near Wright's Pond.

300
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:38,939
We did get a grant to help alleviate some of that issue.

301
00:30:38,959 --> 00:30:42,382
There was a number of questions that were attached to that question.

302
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:46,006
One was, where have we stored snow as a city?

303
00:30:46,226 --> 00:30:48,568
Where does the DPW store excess snow?

304
00:30:49,969 --> 00:30:55,253
over the last three years and maybe amend it with regards to where we plan on storing snow.

305
00:30:55,373 --> 00:30:56,915
Some people say we may have a bad winter.

306
00:30:56,935 --> 00:31:00,938
I'd like to know where we're going to store excess snow this winter.

307
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:11,066
Also, we never got a response and I know the city solicitor was working on it with regards to the issue concerning Wrights Pond and the grant that was received.

308
00:31:11,106 --> 00:31:12,287
So if I can amend this paper

309
00:31:12,777 --> 00:31:17,340
to also get a response on, so that's my second amendment.

310
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,582
First would be where do we store snow?

311
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:25,465
Where do we plan on storing snow this year if we do have a bad winter?

312
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:32,589
And my second amendment would just be with regards to the issue of accepting a grant for Wright's Pond.

313
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:37,197
allow us to still limit Wrights Pond to Medford residents only.

314
00:31:37,517 --> 00:31:38,658
We were waiting on an answer.

315
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:42,801
I know the solicitor has been busy and did say he was going to try to wrap that up.

316
00:31:43,261 --> 00:31:45,763
So I'd like to see if we could get an answer on that.

317
00:31:45,783 --> 00:31:56,670
The City of Medford received a grant for work to be done on Wrights Pond and the question which a number of residents have is if we accept that grant,

318
00:31:57,255 --> 00:32:00,057
can we still limit Rights Pond to Medford residents only?

319
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,321
We had to give back a grant in prior years before I was a counselor.

320
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:13,107
We had to give back, I believe it was a state grant, because if we accepted that grant, we'd have to open up Rights Pond to non-residents.

321
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,809
So we gave back the grant.

322
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:16,650
We had the city cover that money.

323
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:22,014
So now a few residents that were around at that point

324
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:29,937
spoke to me with regards to this grant we just received to make sure we can still limit it because that was an issue over the last year or two.

325
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:39,521
Medford residents fought hard to make sure Rice Pond remained Medford residents only and everybody just wants to make sure that still remains the case.

326
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:43,682
So if we could move approval on this resolution as amended.

327
00:32:44,442 --> 00:32:46,084
see if we can get our questions answered.

328
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:50,427
This is the second or third time we've asked and I'd like to prepare accordingly.

329
00:32:50,827 --> 00:32:51,528
Winter is coming.

330
00:32:51,548 --> 00:32:55,350
We've already had snowfall and it would be nice to get the questions answered.

331
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:55,831
Thank you.

332
00:32:57,432 --> 00:33:02,576
On the motion by Councilor Langel-Curran, as amended by Councilor Langel-Curran, seconded by Councilor Falco.

333
00:33:03,156 --> 00:33:03,877
All those in favor?

334
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:04,477
Aye.

335
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:05,498
Motion passes.

336
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:16,740
17-801 offered by Council Member Kern being resolved that the Memphis City Council receive an update with regards to the test borings and results behind the Andrews School.

337
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,081
Council Member Kern.

338
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:20,083
Thank you, President Carviello.

339
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:29,813
This is also with regards to some pollution that was going on on the side of the Andrews soccer fields.

340
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:37,364
The City Council requested that we also do test pourings, pourings behind the Andrew School.

341
00:33:37,904 --> 00:33:44,950
I know that was a condition on the paper that we had approved, so I just wanted to get the results of that and move approval.

342
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:47,872
On the motion by Council Member Kern.

343
00:33:49,493 --> 00:33:50,614
Name and address of the record, please.

344
00:33:50,834 --> 00:33:53,897
Andrew Castanetti, Cushman Street, Method, Massachusetts.

345
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:15,001
I was hoping if one of you counselors can or will, one or even better, all four of you or better, could please amend this resolution to ask the question, what's up next door to the Andrews Middle School you're talking?

346
00:34:16,402 --> 00:34:18,083
You're talking about the Andrews Middle School, are you?

347
00:34:19,744 --> 00:34:22,606
Behind the Andrews Middle School where the soccer fields are.

348
00:34:23,347 --> 00:34:24,648
Actually the soccer field itself.

349
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:30,325
Well, it was the issue with contamination next to the soccer field.

350
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:45,476
So then I requested that because it was so close to the Andrews, that's not a playground, but the Andrews soccer fields, that we do some test pourings at the Andrews soccer field as it abuts where the contamination was.

351
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:51,700
So I have not got an answer with regards to what the results of that was.

352
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,901
And I think it's important.

353
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:55,263
Hundreds and hundreds of kids play soccer back there.

354
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,528
It's something this council voted in favor of.

355
00:34:57,568 --> 00:35:01,010
I believe seven to nothing to do some test pourings there.

356
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,411
I'd like to know what's going on.

357
00:35:02,631 --> 00:35:03,372
I think that's great.

358
00:35:03,412 --> 00:35:07,495
I think you have very common sense and great courage to ask that question.

359
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:19,903
I would like to find, ask if one, if you could amend this to add next door to that piece of land, which is bordering behind the Dr. Andrews School.

360
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:32,900
I believe that section of land is from the, behind the Doug E. Andrews School to the Riverside Yacht Club.

361
00:35:34,504 --> 00:35:46,933
And I believe it has, as I say in the real estate business, a dirty 21E, which means contaminated soil with arsenic, possibly, and other chemicals.

362
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:51,035
And it's been cordoned off for over a year.

363
00:35:52,797 --> 00:35:55,959
So I'm not sure what's going on.

364
00:35:55,979 --> 00:36:02,103
I would like to know, because that's the area where they're supposed to finish the half-mile bike path.

365
00:36:03,165 --> 00:36:07,646
from the Dogger Andrews to Route 93, behind the salt and stout.

366
00:36:08,186 --> 00:36:11,067
It does not exist, and that's where I had my bicycle injury.

367
00:36:11,787 --> 00:36:13,688
I had my concussion and broken hand.

368
00:36:14,948 --> 00:36:21,189
So I would like to get this half mile of bike, flipper ship, bike path connector done.

369
00:36:21,809 --> 00:36:32,412
It's only a half mile, it's not completed out of the 10 or 20 miles from West Method Island to all the way to the MBTA station at Assembly Road, mind you.

370
00:36:34,466 --> 00:36:44,235
I would think it should have been done in the center of the square before to West Bedford Island and also towards McDonald Park and towards Assembly Road.

371
00:36:44,776 --> 00:36:46,137
The center of the square does not have it.

372
00:36:46,898 --> 00:36:47,799
This has a dirty 21D, I was told.

373
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:55,846
And it's just, it's bordering behind the Dr. Andrews.

374
00:36:56,606 --> 00:37:06,515
So if you could ask, if you're gonna ask that question again, I would like for you to amend it and also ask about the bordering area where the kids play soccer.

375
00:37:07,885 --> 00:37:14,848
through the chair, I will make that amendment that we get an update with regards to the contaminated area, which abuts the soccer fields.

376
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:17,349
That we did put money into already.

377
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:24,212
I know Alicia, I don't know if we've got an update recently on that, so if we could get an update to that as well.

378
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:34,577
That was proven contamination that I know the city is on top of, although obviously it's moving slowly, but we did appropriate money to do the first stage that Ms.

379
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:37,178
Hunt wanted to do, and this came as a

380
00:37:38,408 --> 00:37:44,629
This came actually as a request or a condition in order for us to award that money.

381
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:47,090
So hopefully we can get an answer on both.

382
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,711
I hope you could pass the amendment also.

383
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:50,731
Thank you very much.

384
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:54,852
And if I may, if it's okay, I'd like to say Merry Christmas.

385
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:56,032
Merry Christmas.

386
00:37:56,072 --> 00:37:57,493
Have a good New Year to everybody else.

387
00:37:58,433 --> 00:37:58,793
Thank you.

388
00:37:59,673 --> 00:38:06,155
On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Kern, as amended by Councilor Lungo-Kern, seconded by.

389
00:38:06,175 --> 00:38:06,875
Second.

390
00:38:08,273 --> 00:38:10,194
Councilor Scott Pelly, all those in favor?

391
00:38:10,654 --> 00:38:10,834
Aye.

392
00:38:11,034 --> 00:38:12,214
Motion passes.

393
00:38:12,234 --> 00:38:29,881
17.802 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Office of Diversity and Inclusion conduct an assessment of the number of the handicapped parking spots accessing Wakeman's and provide the council with its findings.

394
00:38:29,921 --> 00:38:30,681
Councilor Knight.

395
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:32,823
Mr. President, thank you very much.

396
00:38:33,343 --> 00:38:44,934
With the changing face of the old Meadow Glen Mall, I've gotten a number of phone calls from constituents concerned about having an inability to access Wegmans because of a lack of handicapped parking spots out in front of that facility.

397
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:51,880
They'd say down at Marshalls and down at Coles there's ample amount of parking, but over in the center of the plaza they're having a difficult time finding some spots.

398
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,482
So I'm asking the

399
00:38:54,923 --> 00:39:05,127
Office of Diversity Inclusion the new name of the diversity office to take a look at this Mr. President and see if they're in compliance with the city ordinance and if we can take any steps to work with Wegmans to put some more spots in closer.

400
00:39:05,147 --> 00:39:06,347
That would be New England Developments.

401
00:39:06,647 --> 00:39:09,168
New England Developments.

402
00:39:09,188 --> 00:39:10,549
You want to change that to New England Developments?

403
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:17,071
Well I think that actually what I want them to do is take a look at actual Wegmans and spots accessing actual Wegmans.

404
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:20,933
So why don't we contact both of them?

405
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:33,608
All right, when the development is actually out there, they, well actually all I want right now is for the Office of Diversity to go out there and see whether or not they're in compliance with our ordinances and if they are, they are, if they aren't, they aren't, then we can take the next step.

406
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:38,311
All right, the motion by Councilor Knight.

407
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:40,912
Seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

408
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:41,712
All those in favor?

409
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:43,693
Motion passes.

410
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:45,855
Motion to take.

411
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:53,247
Motion by Councilor Del Rosso to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

412
00:39:53,347 --> 00:39:54,087
All those in favor?

413
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:54,748
Aye.

414
00:39:54,828 --> 00:39:55,808
Motion passes.

415
00:39:57,909 --> 00:39:59,690
Offered by Councilor Falco.

416
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:13,356
Be it resolved that the administration contact the owner of 101 George P. Hassett Drive to have them board up the open windows on the property in the interest of public safety.

417
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:14,397
Councilor Falco.

418
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:15,958
Thank you, Mr. President.

419
00:40:16,098 --> 00:40:24,024
I was actually on the way to work this morning and coming on the on-ramp onto 93 and driving by 101, George P. Hassett Drive.

420
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:34,633
The address is 101, but you can see it's the building is boarded up, but in the lower half of the building towards the basement, there is the board.

421
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:41,617
So the boards have fallen off the building and the windows are broken and the whole bottom half of the building is exposed.

422
00:40:41,697 --> 00:40:46,279
So anyone can get in there, kids, homeless people, I mean anyone has access to it.

423
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:48,901
So it's a bit of a safety concern that needs to be addressed.

424
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:57,285
So if we could have the administration reach out to the landlord of that building to have that boarded up immediately, I'd greatly appreciate it.

425
00:40:57,405 --> 00:41:03,448
And if I could further amend the paper to basically get some sort of an update from the landlord as to

426
00:41:05,149 --> 00:41:06,310
what they plan to do with the building.

427
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:11,895
I believe it's going to be a hotel, or at one point we were told it was going to be a hotel, but maybe get an update on the timetable.

428
00:41:12,455 --> 00:41:12,676
Thank you.

429
00:41:12,696 --> 00:41:13,036
Thank you.

430
00:41:13,796 --> 00:41:18,380
On the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Falco, seconded by?

431
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,301
Seconded.

432
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:21,223
By Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

433
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:21,663
Aye.

434
00:41:22,123 --> 00:41:22,944
Motion passes.

435
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,507
I regret I passed over something on the agenda.

436
00:41:26,527 --> 00:41:26,547
17-799.

437
00:41:31,226 --> 00:41:41,029
Report of the Committee of the Whole meeting December 12th, 2017 to review and discuss fiscal year 2018 real estate tax allocation.

438
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:51,393
Motion by Councilor Dela Russo to accept the report seconded by Councilor Knight.

439
00:41:51,793 --> 00:41:52,593
All those in favor?

440
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:54,434
Motion passes.

441
00:41:59,218 --> 00:42:00,039
Yeah, I'm sorry

442
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:07,108
I have one more.

443
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:21,400
Offered by the entire council, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Joanne Abbott, who recently lost her battle with cancer.

444
00:42:21,761 --> 00:42:28,887
Joan was a long-time City Hall employee and worked for the Registrar of Voters and later for the Building Department.

445
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:33,811
She will be missed in this building and throughout the community.

446
00:42:34,673 --> 00:42:37,851
and if we could rise for a moment of silence in her honor.

447
00:42:52,088 --> 00:42:52,508
Councilor Knight.

448
00:42:53,268 --> 00:43:00,231
Mr. President, looking at the agenda here, we have paper 17590, 17433, 17606.

449
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:09,795
They're all going to be due for the reviews, whether it be a 60-day or a 180-day or a 90-day review for signage, Mr. President.

450
00:43:09,995 --> 00:43:11,795
Our December 26th meeting is canceled.

451
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:15,037
I'd ask that we mark these up for this January 9th meeting.

452
00:43:15,977 --> 00:43:22,860
Okay, on the motion, Councilor Knight, that we mark these three papers up for the January 9th meeting.

453
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:26,842
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

454
00:43:26,862 --> 00:43:27,202
Second.

455
00:43:27,742 --> 00:43:29,323
By Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

456
00:43:29,923 --> 00:43:29,983
Aye.

457
00:43:30,023 --> 00:43:30,803
Motion passes.

458
00:43:30,843 --> 00:43:36,105
Mr. Clerk, if you could please make that recommendation for the thing.

459
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:38,006
Do you want these individuals to appear?

460
00:43:38,046 --> 00:43:38,587
Yeah, yes.

461
00:43:39,287 --> 00:43:41,108
No, they don't have to appear.

462
00:43:41,148 --> 00:43:42,008
Yeah, they don't have to appear.

463
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:45,510
Also, Senator Russo.

464
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:50,677
I don't want to belabor our time here, Mr. President, and thank you for this indulgence.

465
00:43:51,719 --> 00:44:01,391
The mayor had appointed me some months ago, weeks ago, to represent, to be one of the representatives of the community to the ongoing Green Line Extension Project.

466
00:44:02,472 --> 00:44:04,274
The project is entering a new phase.

467
00:44:05,495 --> 00:44:08,797
They're due to begin construction in the near future.

468
00:44:09,518 --> 00:44:18,824
This will be a process that I think will unfold over the next two years as far as working on the station, the tracks, the rail beds.

469
00:44:19,345 --> 00:44:22,347
In many ways, construction and pre-construction has already begun.

470
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:36,652
We met with the project manager from the MBTA, the assistant manager and many of the community outreach people, and representatives from Medford, Somerville, Cambridge, and related constituencies.

471
00:44:37,732 --> 00:44:44,415
I'll continue to keep the community up to date, and I'm going to continue to urge the mayor

472
00:44:45,375 --> 00:45:02,860
to find resources available on behalf of the administration and the citizens of the community, to have trained representatives and people who are adept at development and planning issues at the table with us.

473
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:05,421
This is going to be a project

474
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:29,434
I urge people, if they wish to reach out to me by email, to do so, if they have any concerns about the project as it moves forward, as far as accessibility, issues around the structures and material of the construction, and also urge people to make their opinion known to the mayor's office as well.

475
00:45:30,014 --> 00:45:33,916
We had a representative also from Citizens Present

476
00:45:35,477 --> 00:45:56,667
Lal Ruma, who is a citizen and a biter to the tracks, has been active for nearly 10 to 12 years in this process, is a member of the committee, and also present and someone who's been a long-time leader and advocate for the Green Line Extension, and someone who brings expertise and reason

477
00:45:57,167 --> 00:46:02,288
to all the processes, Ken Kraus, also a Medford resident.

478
00:46:02,669 --> 00:46:09,290
So it was good to have him there with us, and representing and speaking on behalf of the citizens.

479
00:46:09,671 --> 00:46:17,053
And hopefully as this project moves on, we'll get the best product available for the people of Medford.

480
00:46:18,133 --> 00:46:21,774
Thank you, Councilor Del Rosso, for your hard work on that project.

481
00:46:23,397 --> 00:46:24,157
So, Mr. President?

482
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:25,738
Vice President Marks.

483
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:28,918
If I could ask Councilor Del Rosario a question.

484
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:32,739
There are three representatives on this Green Line extension?

485
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:33,179
Yes.

486
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:36,760
And they are Ken Crouch, yourself, and Laurel Ruma?

487
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:37,740
Nope.

488
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:47,503
Myself, Laurel Ruma, the three appointees from the mayor, myself, Laurel Ruma, and Rocco DiRico of Tufts University.

489
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,324
And that organization is a major stakeholder as the

490
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:58,869
uh, station, the Medford station, uh, is in the midst of their properties.

491
00:46:59,090 --> 00:46:59,350
Right.

492
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:16,475
So, so, Mr. President, we, we did have, uh, other residents that sat on this committee, uh, the first phase of the Green Line Extension, um, of which Doug Carr and Jim Silva were not asked to be back, uh, on the Green Line Extension Committee.

493
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:28,500
and one was replaced by Rocco Durico, I've known for a lot of years and he does tremendous work, but he's representing Tufts University and not representing the city of Method.

494
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:39,925
And I have a concern when you only have three representatives on a committee that are here to represent the city and of which one represents Tufts University.

495
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:45,668
Doug Carr, who was also on the committee, was a representative and the chairman

496
00:47:46,128 --> 00:47:50,469
of all the communities when they had host meetings.

497
00:47:51,170 --> 00:48:08,495
Dakar was the chairman and a very knowledgeable person, as well as Jim Silva, who represented the South Meffitt area through SMARTO and so forth, and was instrumental, and still is instrumental, in passing information out to residents and neighborhood in this community.

498
00:48:09,135 --> 00:48:18,778
And I think it's a huge loss not to have those two gentlemen reappointed on this committee, Mr. President.

499
00:48:19,198 --> 00:48:29,742
And I would ask that the mayor reconsider the members of this committee and look at reappointing Doug Carr and Jim Silva back to the committee.

500
00:48:29,762 --> 00:48:30,222
The President.

501
00:48:30,402 --> 00:48:31,303
Expanding the committee?

502
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,783
Whatever needs to be done, Mr. President.

503
00:48:33,823 --> 00:48:38,325
But to have one person that doesn't really represent the city

504
00:48:39,365 --> 00:48:40,706
on the board of three.

505
00:48:41,207 --> 00:48:51,533
To me, there are plenty of other people that have been active for years on this Green Line Extension, and have taken countless hours out of their schedule to attend these meetings.

506
00:48:52,353 --> 00:49:03,560
I know we have Councilor DelaRusso on the committee, and I look forward to, you know, information being dispersed to the council regarding the Green Line Extension.

507
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,462
But knowing that Doug Carr and Jim Silva were so instrumental

508
00:49:08,042 --> 00:49:10,503
in disseminating information and being involved.

509
00:49:10,963 --> 00:49:16,485
I'm extremely disappointed in the mayor not including them in this second phase, Mr. President.

510
00:49:17,785 --> 00:49:18,885
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

511
00:49:21,266 --> 00:49:32,950
On the motion by Vice President Marks that Jim Silver and Doug Cobb be added to the Green Line Committee to be sent to the mayor for her consideration,

512
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:37,755
Councilor Knight.

513
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:42,498
Do you know if these individuals had a willingness to continue to serve in their positions?

514
00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:52,204
I, Councilor, Vice President Moxley, if they expressed... Both expressed interest in written letters stating that they'd like to serve.

515
00:49:52,224 --> 00:49:53,285
Did they send those letters to the man?

516
00:49:54,385 --> 00:49:55,366
Well in advance, yes.

517
00:49:55,866 --> 00:49:58,928
Do we know if there are any other individuals in the community that have expressed some interest?

518
00:49:58,948 --> 00:50:00,309
I would not know that.

519
00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:03,351
If any other individuals... We're going to make recommendations.

520
00:50:03,431 --> 00:50:04,832
Maybe we'd want to take a look at everybody.

521
00:50:05,852 --> 00:50:07,913
It's not up to us to take a look at anyone.

522
00:50:08,074 --> 00:50:18,739
I'm just throwing out the fact that we had two people sitting on this that did yeoman's work on behalf of the residents of this community, and I expressed my disappointment that they weren't reappointed.

523
00:50:18,979 --> 00:50:19,359
That's all.

524
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:20,620
Thank you.

525
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:31,366
I shared my information and I didn't have this as a resolution, nor did I request a motion, but to receive and place on file, Mr. President.

526
00:50:33,282 --> 00:50:33,983
Council Member O'Karyn.

527
00:50:34,483 --> 00:50:34,764
Thank you.

528
00:50:34,784 --> 00:50:48,658
Through the Chair, I think we should just request that the Mayor look into expanding the committee and hopefully open up applications to those who are interested and hopefully those that have been working so hard and going to meetings will apply.

529
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:51,522
On the motion.

530
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:55,700
She should expand the committee.

531
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,962
The bigger the committee, the better.

532
00:50:56,982 --> 00:51:04,554
The more people that can serve in different capacities on a committee that is working on the green line, the better.

533
00:51:05,094 --> 00:51:07,017
You should have somebody from the neighborhood.

534
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:13,725
probably want to be on this committee, so I request that we look into expanding this committee.

535
00:51:14,546 --> 00:51:23,776
On the motion by Vice President Box that we request that the Mayor expand the Green Line Committee, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

536
00:51:23,816 --> 00:51:24,556
All those in favor?

537
00:51:25,718 --> 00:51:26,558
Motion passes.

538
00:51:27,814 --> 00:51:30,335
Do we have any further business this evening before we adjourn?

539
00:51:30,936 --> 00:51:32,297
Happy holidays to everybody.

540
00:51:33,017 --> 00:51:49,946
Hearing and seeing none, I think on behalf of all my city council colleagues and everyone in the building, I wish everybody a merry Christmas, a happy Hanukkah, happy holidays, and a safe new year.

541
00:51:50,006 --> 00:51:51,087
Before the records are called.

542
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,556
Before the records are called, if I may.

543
00:51:55,957 --> 00:52:07,007
I just want to let the public know that there's a public hearing notice City of Medford Community Development Board for February 7th, 2018.

544
00:52:08,048 --> 00:52:10,791
They shall conduct a public hearing on February 7th, 2018 at 6 p.m.

545
00:52:10,831 --> 00:52:11,611
in room 201 City Hall.

546
00:52:15,034 --> 00:52:39,657
The hearing is relative to a petition by the Medford City Council to amend Chapter 94 Zoning, Article 2, Division 1, Section 9435E by adding language in the fifth line after the word enumeral Section 2 as follows, and such notice shall also be given to all owners within 400 feet of the property line of a petitioner, as the same are listed in the most recent tax list as kept by the city assessor of the city.

547
00:52:40,578 --> 00:52:58,397
In such notice shall also be given to owners within 400 feet of the property line of the petitioner as the same are listed in the most recent tax list as kept by the chief assessor of the city by way of a telephone call or text message that uses a computerized auto dialer to deliver a pre-recorded message or its equivalent.

548
00:52:58,697 --> 00:53:03,201
A copy of the full text of the amendment is available at the office of the city clerk, city hall.

549
00:53:03,922 --> 00:53:20,181
And I know that Clerk Finn did get the language that our city solicitor helped us draft last week, so our resolve was amended to state that the city council suggest or recommend that a planning board discuss a viable alternative for the applicable ability

550
00:53:20,741 --> 00:53:31,830
of this expanded notification such as applying to any projects that are subject to site plan review or conversion of housing units more than presently exist.

551
00:53:32,351 --> 00:53:36,734
So I thank our city solicitor for his hard work on this and helping us last week.

552
00:53:37,194 --> 00:53:44,100
Thank the Community Development Board for holding a meeting on February 7th and hopefully this is posted and advertised.

553
00:53:45,101 --> 00:53:50,745
I'd like to just put a motion out that a reverse 911 call go out with regards to this meeting if possible.

554
00:53:50,765 --> 00:53:55,029
I think it's an extremely important meeting and the public should be aware of it.

555
00:53:56,523 --> 00:54:04,348
On the motion by Council Member Kern that a 9-1-1 reverse call goes out for the February 7th meeting.

556
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:05,149
All those in favor?

557
00:54:05,469 --> 00:54:05,870
Aye.

558
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:06,770
Motion passes.

559
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:13,154
Records of the meeting of December 12th, 2017 were passed to Council Member Kern.

560
00:54:13,194 --> 00:54:15,436
Council Member Kern, how did you find those records?

561
00:54:15,476 --> 00:54:17,878
I reviewed the records and I find them in order and I move approval.

562
00:54:18,658 --> 00:54:19,099
Second.

563
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:23,923
On the motion by Councilor Kern that she filed the records in order.

564
00:54:25,004 --> 00:54:26,525
Seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

565
00:54:27,186 --> 00:54:28,127
Motion passes.

566
00:54:28,367 --> 00:54:30,429
Again, happy holidays to everyone.

567
00:54:30,449 --> 00:54:36,074
Merry Christmas to all my councilors and people in the city.

568
00:54:36,094 --> 00:54:37,675
Motion to adjourn by Councilor Knight.

569
00:54:38,255 --> 00:54:39,557
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

570
00:54:39,617 --> 00:54:40,457
All those in favor, aye.

571
00:54:41,899 --> 00:54:42,519
Motion passes.

572
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:43,160
Merry Christmas.

573
00:55:50,493 --> 00:55:51,735
tribute from the audience.

574
00:55:52,536 --> 00:55:57,503
It was just a tremendous feeling of, in my opinion, pride.

575
00:55:58,745 --> 00:56:06,937
Pride in knowing that I'm a part of something that has given people tremendous joy.

576
00:56:09,081 --> 00:56:12,144
People are smiling, even amongst all this sadness.

577
00:56:12,905 --> 00:56:13,906
People are smiling.

578
00:56:14,727 --> 00:56:21,594
Even as the performers hug each other, hug their children, babies in arms in the ring, they're also smiling.

579
00:56:33,772 --> 00:56:38,399
and we hope the memories we've made together will last you a lifetime.

580
00:56:38,439 --> 00:56:39,301
Until then, thank you.

581
00:56:49,485 --> 00:57:00,596
So you kept your ringmaster stiff upper lip while you were in the ring with your children and wife and all the families and the performers and crew around you.

582
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:02,898
Must have been over 200 of you in the ring.

583
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:04,420
But when did you break?

584
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:05,161
I haven't.

585
00:57:05,641 --> 00:57:06,442
Not a quiver?

586
00:57:06,562 --> 00:57:08,584
Not a wobbly lip?

587
00:57:08,764 --> 00:57:09,825
Not a single tear.

588
00:57:10,306 --> 00:57:11,947
It was so busy.

589
00:57:12,828 --> 00:57:18,430
after that, because there was a lot of hugging and kissing and picture-taking backstage.

590
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:24,933
And all I had on my mind was, oh, my goodness, I still have to go home and finish packing.

591
00:57:26,873 --> 00:57:28,214
Because I had a lot to pack.

592
00:57:28,454 --> 00:57:32,355
In fact, I stayed up until about 7 a.m.

593
00:57:33,536 --> 00:57:39,638
that morning, and I took a little nap and then got up again and packed some more before the movers came.

594
00:57:41,575 --> 00:57:44,478
Now all the packing is done, the train broken up.

595
00:57:45,499 --> 00:57:52,825
After writing a CV for the first time in over 20 years, Jonathan has a new job as artistic director at Opera Del Sol.

596
00:57:53,646 --> 00:57:57,470
Alex Lacey is in Europe with his big cats, but minus one.

597
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:06,318
A tiger escaped on the journey from Uniondale to the winter quarters in Florida, was found wandering on the highway and shot.

598
00:58:08,241 --> 00:58:08,901
Shanda Eck.

599
00:58:09,922 --> 00:58:15,084
He dreams of becoming a bartender, but for now he's a stay-at-home dad for his two-year-old son.

600
00:58:16,045 --> 00:58:18,666
Dolly and Pedro's circus school continues to flourish.

601
00:58:19,106 --> 00:58:25,710
This summer, they performed in a big top on the mall outside the White House, the first circus ever to do so.

602
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:31,372
Sixteen-year-old Scott, he's conquered the flying trapeze.

603
00:58:33,133 --> 00:58:33,754
Do I miss it?

604
00:58:34,034 --> 00:58:35,935
Every single minute of my life.

605
00:58:37,756 --> 00:58:44,358
I have a Ringling poster in my living room signed by the whole cast.

606
00:58:46,779 --> 00:58:48,679
I treasure that thing so much.

607
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:52,080
That's a giant clown poster with everybody signed it.

608
00:58:53,641 --> 00:58:58,342
Sometimes I pass in Las Vegas downtown where our train used to park.

609
00:58:58,482 --> 00:59:00,863
I just go there, you know, to just see it.

610
00:59:02,043 --> 00:59:05,605
I travel somewhere and I remember, oh, that was an arena I performed.

611
00:59:05,745 --> 00:59:07,385
Oh, you guys remember what happened here?

612
00:59:07,726 --> 00:59:08,786
Oh, I got married here.

613
00:59:08,886 --> 00:59:09,726
Oh, I divorced here.

614
00:59:10,227 --> 00:59:14,668
There is everywhere in America, every major city and every state, something happened.

615
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:17,350
And you will never, ever gonna forget.

616
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:18,910
And you always gonna miss it.

617
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:22,972
If your heart is in a circus, you always will miss it.

618
00:59:26,653 --> 00:59:32,996
Who Killed the Circus was presented by me, Dee Burkitt, and produced by Emily Williams.

619
00:59:33,876 --> 00:59:37,177
It's a Whistledown production for the BBC World Service.

620
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:47,355
The boundless deep under Evening Star.

621
00:59:47,695 --> 00:59:51,738
It covers more of an area than all of our land masses put together.

622
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:53,699
A flood that bears us far.

623
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:58,523
It doesn't matter what you do in England or China or anywhere, it's going to affect another country.

624
01:00:09,653 --> 01:00:11,995
You're listening to the BBC World Service.

625
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,181
Welcome, this is Business Matters.

626
01:00:47,441 --> 01:00:49,622
Today we're going to talk a bit about tax cuts.

627
01:00:49,962 --> 01:00:50,182
U.S.

628
01:00:50,242 --> 01:00:57,466
Republicans hope to pass their tax reform bill in the Senate, as well as the House will meet taxpayers in rural Texas.

629
01:00:57,826 --> 01:01:05,910
You know, I hope it does pass, and I hope we do get some money back to the middle class, which is all it's going to do is turn around and make our economy stronger.

630
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:11,674
I'm a single mom of two, so I'll get two child credits back at the end of the year.

631
01:01:12,254 --> 01:01:13,915
And that's not going up for me.

632
01:01:14,016 --> 01:01:19,900
But as far as somebody who, let's say, is making $150,000 in the home, they're going to get more money back.

633
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,803
So yes, they are putting in more money into the system.

634
01:01:23,843 --> 01:01:25,003
But no, it's not helping me.

635
01:01:25,664 --> 01:01:30,648
And later this half hour, final campaign rallies in Catalonia ahead of Thursday's election.

636
01:01:31,008 --> 01:01:33,690
Will the Spanish prime minister's gamble pay off?

637
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:41,552
Hello, I'm Marion Marshall with the BBC News.

638
01:01:42,153 --> 01:01:48,340
US senators are debating whether to approve a bill that would see the biggest overhaul of the country's tax system in decades.

639
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,483
A vote in the Senate is expected in the next few hours.

640
01:01:52,004 --> 01:02:00,814
However, final approval will have to wait until Wednesday, as the bill is being sent back to the House for procedural reasons, as David Willis reports from Washington.

641
01:02:01,394 --> 01:02:14,238
It passed the House of Representatives this afternoon, a lot of celebration there, only to go to the Senate, where it was found that some of the wording didn't conform with requirements in the Senate.

642
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:18,080
It now has to go back to the House of Representatives for another vote.

643
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:24,462
So that vote will take place tomorrow morning, and it's likely to go to the president for signing

644
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:27,305
perhaps later that same day.

645
01:02:27,365 --> 01:02:32,692
President Trump, of course, will be very, very pleased to get his hands on this piece of legislation.

646
01:02:32,752 --> 01:02:40,642
It's the major legislative victory, assuming all goes well with those two votes, of his time in office thus far.

647
01:02:41,363 --> 01:02:49,692
The defeated candidate in presidential elections in Honduras, Salvador Nasralla, has accepted an invitation for talks with President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

648
01:02:50,213 --> 01:02:57,421
Mr Nasralla has accused his rival of rigging the vote and says he has handed evidence to the Organization of American States in Washington.

649
01:02:57,901 --> 01:02:59,343
He's demanding a new election.

650
01:03:00,664 --> 01:03:07,672
A bus carrying foreign tourists to Mayan ruins in Mexico has crashed, killing at least 12 people, including a child.

651
01:03:08,232 --> 01:03:12,757
The bus had been travelling to the eastern tip of the Yucatan Peninsula when it veered off the road.

652
01:03:13,197 --> 01:03:15,420
Here's our Mexico correspondent, Will Grant.

653
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:27,252
The tourists had arrived in Mexico on board a Royal Caribbean cruise ship, and this, a visit to the beautiful Mayan ruins of Chacho Ben, was meant to be a pleasurable day trip to see a little of the country.

654
01:03:27,713 --> 01:03:35,922
However, a dozen people were killed and many more injured when the bus overturned on the highway out to the ruins, south of the popular resort of Tulum.

655
01:03:36,422 --> 01:03:39,448
An investigation is underway as to the cause of the crash.

656
01:03:39,869 --> 01:03:48,324
Many of the coastal roads in that particular state of Quintana Roo are poor and potholed, especially on the southern road down to the border with Belize.

657
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:59,069
The US ambassador to the United Nations has said a missile fired at the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh from Yemen bears the hallmarks of an attack using weapons provided by Iran.

658
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:04,214
Houthi rebels, who are supported by Iran, claimed responsibility for the missile launch.

659
01:04:04,855 --> 01:04:09,840
The US ambassador, Nikki Haley, said she was very concerned about this latest development.

660
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:18,804
According to the Houthis themselves, it was targeted at a meeting of Saudi leaders in Riyadh, in an area crowded with government offices.

661
01:04:19,624 --> 01:04:23,586
Thankfully, the missile was intercepted before it could hit its intended target.

662
01:04:24,246 --> 01:04:29,568
But the very fact of this attack is a flashing red siren for this council.

663
01:04:30,149 --> 01:04:34,951
It is only a matter of time before one of these missiles hits the target.

664
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:37,472
World News from the BBC.

665
01:04:39,107 --> 01:04:45,470
The United Nations Refugee Agency has said it's stepping up its operation on the border between Cameroon and Southeast Nigeria.

666
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:54,274
Thousands of Cameroonians have fled from their country after clashes between security forces and pro-independence groups in Cameroon's English-speaking region.

667
01:04:54,934 --> 01:05:01,917
Tensions between the English-speaking minority and the government, which is dominated by Francophones, have escalated in the last year.

668
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:11,808
Canada and the United States have announced that they'll co-host a summit of foreign ministers to discuss the deepening crisis over North Korea's nuclear ambitions.

669
01:05:12,489 --> 01:05:15,809
The Canadian Foreign Minister, Chrystia Freeland, and the visiting U.S.

670
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:21,871
Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, said the meeting next month would include envoys from Japan and South Korea.

671
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:27,233
It will consider how to improve the effectiveness of the current pressure campaign against Pyongyang.

672
01:05:28,867 --> 01:05:35,850
After forming a coalition with a far-right party, Austria's new chancellor has travelled to Brussels to reassure EU leaders.

673
01:05:36,351 --> 01:05:43,734
Sebastian Kurz, who leads the Conservative People's Party, has entered an alliance with the Eurosceptic and anti-immigration Freedom Party.

674
01:05:44,354 --> 01:05:51,538
Speaking in Brussels at a news conference with the President of the European Commission, Mr Kurz said his government remained a committed EU member.

675
01:05:55,279 --> 01:05:58,121
We want to contribute to a strong European Union.

676
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:09,685
We would like a European Union which will be stronger when it comes to the big issues and at the same time stands back when it comes to smaller issues, where member states or regions are well equipped to make decisions.

677
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:15,488
I do appreciate that over the past few years there's been an effort to reduce legislative initiatives.

678
01:06:16,468 --> 01:06:24,570
An investigation has been launched in India after a metro train crashed through the walls of a station in the capital Delhi during a trial run.

679
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:30,491
The incident took place just days ahead of the planned inauguration of the new line by the Prime Minister.

680
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:32,572
There were no passengers on the train.

681
01:06:33,212 --> 01:06:35,293
Trains on the new line are planned to be driverless.

682
01:06:36,253 --> 01:06:37,133
BBC News

683
01:06:43,671 --> 01:06:44,332
Hello, welcome.

684
01:06:44,412 --> 01:06:45,953
This is Business Matters.

685
01:06:46,033 --> 01:06:47,955
Fergus Nicol with you today from London.

686
01:06:48,116 --> 01:06:51,979
In a moment, our main headline after a year of legislative frustration.

687
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:56,304
President Trump secures a win in the House of Representatives, at least.

688
01:06:56,384 --> 01:07:00,888
Republicans pushing through the most radical overhaul of the US tax system in decades.

689
01:07:00,908 --> 01:07:02,410
We'll talk about that in a second.

690
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:07,135
Later in the program, why is China setting up a carbon market?

691
01:07:07,575 --> 01:07:21,224
It's a commitment to put this system into place, which puts on notice the rest of the world, especially existing carbon markets in the European Union and California, that there will be potential to link up with the China's market, and that's a very big deal.

692
01:07:21,544 --> 01:07:25,027
Does China's involvement mean it's an idea that is really catching on?

693
01:07:25,067 --> 01:07:26,067
Let's greet our guests.

694
01:07:26,107 --> 01:07:28,569
We'll be talking about these and other issues during the hour.

695
01:07:28,989 --> 01:07:32,792
From New Delhi this morning, Madhavan Narayanan of FirstPost.com.

696
01:07:32,812 --> 01:07:34,373
Madhavan, good to have you back with us.

697
01:07:34,413 --> 01:07:36,374
Thanks for starting the day with business matters.

698
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:37,555
Thank you, Fergus.

699
01:07:37,835 --> 01:07:38,796
Greetings from Delhi.

700
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:40,717
Greetings from London.

701
01:07:40,737 --> 01:07:42,399
Let's say hello from Austin, Texas.

702
01:07:42,879 --> 01:07:45,981
Andy Euler, reporter with Marketplace on American Public Media.

703
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:51,886
We'll be hearing your account of tax issues in Texas in just a couple of minutes.

704
01:07:51,906 --> 01:07:52,587
You're most welcome.

705
01:07:53,318 --> 01:07:54,618
Thanks for having me Fergus, good to be here.

706
01:07:54,778 --> 01:07:55,619
Good to have you back.

707
01:07:55,679 --> 01:08:02,300
We'll start then of course in the US where the administration could be forgiven for thinking tonight one down, one to go.

708
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:13,043
The Republican majority in the House of Representatives successfully steered its tax reform bill through to a 227 to 203 vote victory.

709
01:08:13,563 --> 01:08:15,303
Next comes the Senate.

710
01:08:15,343 --> 01:08:17,644
There's been a bit of a kerfuffle as we heard in the news.

711
01:08:18,044 --> 01:08:22,725
The Senate sent the bill back to the House to think it can get another vote tomorrow morning and then the Senate gets its

712
01:08:23,225 --> 01:08:25,748
go, probably before the end of Wednesday.

713
01:08:25,848 --> 01:08:32,655
And if that goes according to plan, the first legislative win of Donald Trump's presidency will go to his desk for signature.

714
01:08:33,376 --> 01:08:37,019
And we can expect that to be done with something more than his customary flourish.

715
01:08:37,440 --> 01:08:38,281
Back to the House then.

716
01:08:38,441 --> 01:08:39,242
What happened today?

717
01:08:39,262 --> 01:08:41,644
A completely partisan outcome.

718
01:08:42,024 --> 01:08:43,246
Here's the Speaker, Paul Ryan.

719
01:08:43,835 --> 01:08:52,159
We said in 2016 that it would take real tax reform for families and businesses to get the American economy growing, and we were serious.

720
01:08:52,639 --> 01:08:56,241
On January 1, Americans are going to wake up with a new tax code.

721
01:08:56,581 --> 01:08:59,983
In February, they're going to see withholdings go down so they see bigger paychecks.

722
01:09:00,463 --> 01:09:05,766
And April 15 will be the last day they have to comply with the old, bad system.

723
01:09:06,026 --> 01:09:07,587
This is a good day for America.

724
01:09:07,847 --> 01:09:09,207
This is a good day for workers.

725
01:09:09,507 --> 01:09:12,469
This is a great day for growth, and we're very excited about this moment.

726
01:09:12,897 --> 01:09:15,965
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, not so much.

727
01:09:16,306 --> 01:09:21,178
She highlighted poll numbers, which have shown a steady decline in public support for the tax plan.

728
01:09:21,762 --> 01:09:26,386
Outside the Congress, the American people have already made their decision.

729
01:09:26,966 --> 01:09:32,410
Polling shows that Americans oppose the GOP tax scam by a margin of two to one.

730
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:39,495
Hardworking families see right through the brazen con job Republicans are trying to sell them.

731
01:09:40,016 --> 01:09:44,619
So why aren't our Republican colleagues standing with their constituents?

732
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:49,583
Why aren't they joining us, insisting on a better deal for American families?

733
01:09:50,224 --> 01:09:56,268
away from the beltway, how is this highly charged issue playing out in the places where the real taxpayers live?

734
01:09:56,768 --> 01:10:01,411
I've been talking to two Republican voters in Missouri.

735
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,072
Walt Cooper lives in Kansas City.

736
01:10:03,453 --> 01:10:06,895
He's retired, but he used to work in the medical services technology sector.

737
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:09,857
Janet Matteliati is an attorney in St.

738
01:10:09,897 --> 01:10:10,137
Louis.

739
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:16,310
I think it's hopefully going to be good for most of the people in the United States.

740
01:10:16,691 --> 01:10:19,992
I think simplifying things will be particularly good.

741
01:10:20,012 --> 01:10:30,757
I know some people say that this is only going to be good for the rich, but I think it will help people across the board and a lot of the middle class, of which I consider myself part of the middle class.

742
01:10:31,341 --> 01:10:33,442
Opening thoughts from Walt Cooper then.

743
01:10:33,622 --> 01:10:42,965
Just tell us how you see what's been going on in Washington and how well it reflects your concerns about the tax system as it's operated through your professional life.

744
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:48,147
I agree with Janet somewhat that I think it's going to be a positive thing.

745
01:10:48,467 --> 01:11:00,991
I'm just recently retired and so I've been around a while and have watched taxes come and go, raise and lower, and I think giving people back as much money as you can and leaving it in the people's hands

746
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:03,032
is the best way to go about this.

747
01:11:03,232 --> 01:11:07,795
Government tends to waste our money at times, and they always want more.

748
01:11:08,376 --> 01:11:14,860
And so I believe that if we do get some meaningful tax relief, I think it's going to be positive for our economy.

749
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:26,727
So when we heard Speaker Ryan say on Capitol Hill earlier on Tuesday, this is giving the money back to the people, you're all for that because you think the government doesn't spend it right?

750
01:11:26,967 --> 01:11:30,049
Well, I mean, I don't know of any government that spends it right.

751
01:11:30,129 --> 01:11:40,615
And I think we have so many examples of government continuing to, I mean, they're one of the largest employers in the United States, and they've never cut back on anything ever, as far as I can remember.

752
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:50,962
And really, this is not, I mean, it's a tax cut, but it's a little bit of a misnomer in my mind, because they continue to talk about deficit that it'll create.

753
01:11:51,462 --> 01:11:54,964
and continue conversations about paying for the tax cut.

754
01:11:55,064 --> 01:12:02,229
So when you use the term paying for the tax cut, to me, that's code for, well, the government needs just as much money as they always did.

755
01:12:02,389 --> 01:12:15,937
So what I would really like to see is not only a tax cut, but the government being forced to tighten their belt to say, we're going to give people back some of their money, and the government itself is going to run on less.

756
01:12:16,097 --> 01:12:17,838
I agree with Walt that I think the

757
01:12:18,338 --> 01:12:21,660
government doesn't spend our money wisely in many cases.

758
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:29,186
I know certain things have to be taken care of, but just like any family here in America, when things are tight, you have to tighten your belt and rein things in.

759
01:12:29,266 --> 01:12:32,768
And I agree with Walt that I don't think the federal government ever does that.

760
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,729
We just seem to increase and increase.

761
01:12:34,909 --> 01:12:40,513
So I would certainly like this followed up with spending cuts and things so that we can pay for it.

762
01:12:40,573 --> 01:12:42,755
Now, one of my hopes is that in

763
01:12:43,354 --> 01:12:56,471
reducing the corporate rate that we can get more businesses back in the United States, since our rates were higher than most other countries, which will help the economy and will help pay for some of this, but I do think we need to do some spending cuts also.

764
01:12:57,044 --> 01:13:05,452
Janet, I want to stay with you first and pick up a word you used I think is going to resonate with a lot of listeners in the U.S., and that is simplifying.

765
01:13:05,972 --> 01:13:14,720
Thank the Lord I don't have to deal with the IRS, but I have American friends who do, and even the kind of briefing paper to help you do your taxes

766
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:17,381
requires a doctorate, I think, to understand.

767
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:27,905
Tell us about the complexity of regular tax paying and how much harder it gets maybe when you're dealing with wills and all kinds of complicated legal procedures.

768
01:13:28,726 --> 01:13:33,888
I mean, it's very complicated and I would have to laugh as an attorney who does estate tax planning.

769
01:13:34,401 --> 01:13:42,006
I don't even do my own income tax returns, because there's all kinds of regulations for that, in addition to the stuff that I deal with.

770
01:13:42,086 --> 01:13:51,892
But I think they're on the right track as far as reducing a lot of the itemized deduction and increasing the standard deduction, because that's going to help a lot of people.

771
01:13:51,932 --> 01:13:55,875
I think a lot more people will do the standardized deductions as opposed to the itemized.

772
01:13:56,075 --> 01:14:04,542
As it relates to my business, one part of the tax plan doubles the exemption from the state taxes and gift taxes.

773
01:14:04,682 --> 01:14:08,405
So by doing that, a lot of our clients will fall within that.

774
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:21,575
So it's going to reduce what they have to do in some advanced planning, as far as the state tax would be concerned, and allows them to go back to do some more capital gains type planning with their estate plan, since they don't have to worry about the federal estate tax.

775
01:14:23,817 --> 01:14:26,077
The word onerous just comes to my mind.

776
01:14:26,478 --> 01:14:32,160
I have a certified public accountant that's been doing my taxes for 30 years because I'm afraid to do them myself.

777
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:44,545
If you are in my stage of life where you're retiring and you're thinking about how you're going to live the rest of your life and live well as best you can on the money you have, one of the things that CPAs will tell you is,

778
01:14:44,925 --> 01:14:46,847
you'd better be planning for taxes.

779
01:14:46,907 --> 01:14:49,009
But how does the average person do that?

780
01:14:49,149 --> 01:14:54,194
There's entire industries in the United States to manage people's taxes.

781
01:14:54,475 --> 01:15:00,461
So, I mean, that's all you kind of need to know, is it's so complicated that there isn't anybody that knows it all.

782
01:15:00,781 --> 01:15:04,184
I think simplification is a wonderful concept.

783
01:15:04,325 --> 01:15:06,607
I hope that it is, in fact, real.

784
01:15:06,907 --> 01:15:08,548
I know this is a huge document.

785
01:15:08,789 --> 01:15:22,700
I wonder whether you can highlight, each of you, maybe three things that you think are immediately going to help America in terms of boosting jobs, boosting business, boosting collective incomes.

786
01:15:23,482 --> 01:15:23,862
Sure.

787
01:15:23,962 --> 01:15:33,668
I think I maybe kind of mentioned it before, but I think the reduction in the corporate tax will help to get some businesses back in the United States.

788
01:15:34,028 --> 01:15:44,414
One thing, and it really doesn't have to do with taxes, but I am in favor of the drilling in Alaska, and I think that will help our economy and help us become more oil independent.

789
01:15:44,614 --> 01:15:52,318
And again, I'm just hoping that reducing the rates is going to get more money in average Americans' pockets, and then they will in turn be spending that.

790
01:15:52,598 --> 01:15:53,138
That's three.

791
01:15:53,318 --> 01:15:56,719
Walt, you're definitely allowed to agree.

792
01:15:56,879 --> 01:16:09,343
Well, I think that Janet mentioned this earlier, but in terms of simplification, doubling the standard deduction for the average person, about 30 percent, I think, of American itemized deductions.

793
01:16:09,403 --> 01:16:11,324
So that means 70 percent don't.

794
01:16:11,404 --> 01:16:16,345
So when you double that, that immediately puts money back in that middle class pocket.

795
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:26,968
And I think that if you go back to the days of Ronald Reagan and moving into the Clinton administration, we've seen what putting money back in people's pockets does for the economy.

796
01:16:27,048 --> 01:16:42,131
So we might get a double whammy with that and the corporate tax rate that I agree that Janet talked about, because there's going to be a lot of repatriation of money coming back in the United States from corporations in here who have that money parked overseas.

797
01:16:42,251 --> 01:16:44,252
I think our economy is going to be hot for a while.

798
01:16:44,809 --> 01:16:45,770
hot for a while.

799
01:16:45,891 --> 01:16:48,815
Our thanks to Walt Cooper and Janet Matteliani.

800
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:50,757
They're both speaking to us from Missouri.

801
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:57,226
And let's go to Andy now in Austin, because you've been out and about talking to voters in rural parts of Texas.

802
01:16:57,246 --> 01:17:00,471
Tell us a little bit about where you've been and the kind of people we're going to hear from.

803
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:01,479
That's right.

804
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,521
I went outside of Austin, which is right in the center.

805
01:17:04,601 --> 01:17:09,205
It's the capital of Texas, and I went about an hour west to a town.

806
01:17:09,846 --> 01:17:16,351
It was actually Burnett and Llano counties, and I went to Horseshoe Bay, which is kind of a retirement community.

807
01:17:18,113 --> 01:17:23,298
It's mostly sort of upper middle class folks, and they move out there from the hill country.

808
01:17:23,318 --> 01:17:24,659
A lot of folks have land out there.

809
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:46,977
But, I really kind of just wanted to get a sense from them, I mean, the counties that I went to were 75% Trump voters, so I wanted to get a sense from them, sort of, what they were thinking about this tax bill, and just really honest, visceral reactions from, you know, not even necessarily the intricacies of the bill, because it's, like you said, 600 pages, and, you know, a lot of senators haven't read it.

810
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:52,962
I just wanted from these folks to get a real visceral reaction to what this tax bill meant to them.

811
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:54,974
My name is Leon Fuller.

812
01:17:55,315 --> 01:17:57,697
I work at Horseshoe Bay Veterinarian Clinic.

813
01:17:58,037 --> 01:17:59,699
He's got faith in the tax bill.

814
01:17:59,899 --> 01:18:08,027
You know, I hope it does pass, and I hope we do get some money back to the middle class, which is all it's going to do is turn around and make our economy stronger.

815
01:18:08,307 --> 01:18:12,130
Retired marketing and sales rep Frank Hosia is a little more cautious.

816
01:18:12,711 --> 01:18:13,392
It's way too early.

817
01:18:14,092 --> 01:18:18,814
Between the Senate and Congress, they're going to have so many different reiterations of this.

818
01:18:19,454 --> 01:18:22,375
So anything we think about that we know, don't.

819
01:18:22,795 --> 01:18:25,136
But he does think the tax system needs an overhaul.

820
01:18:25,456 --> 01:18:28,277
He voted for Trump and thinks the bet on trickle-down is a good one.

821
01:18:28,658 --> 01:18:32,899
Having the highest corporate tax rate in the world makes no sense.

822
01:18:33,539 --> 01:18:37,761
We're seeing the amount of jobs that are leaving the country and have been leaving the country.

823
01:18:38,341 --> 01:18:42,743
Let's figure out how to bring the monies back to the country as well as the jobs back to the country.

824
01:18:43,163 --> 01:18:48,029
Just a couple miles down the road in another little town, Marble Falls, I stop in at the R Bar.

825
01:18:48,609 --> 01:18:49,590
I'm Nadine Rader.

826
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:53,134
I'm from Marble Falls and I'm a server at Noon Spoon Cafe.

827
01:18:53,515 --> 01:18:53,655
I'm 25.

828
01:18:54,476 --> 01:18:56,798
She didn't vote in last year's presidential election.

829
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:02,285
I'm a single mom of two, so I'll get two child credits back at the end of the year.

830
01:19:02,925 --> 01:19:04,585
And that's not going up for me.

831
01:19:04,685 --> 01:19:16,628
But as far as somebody who, let's say, is making $150,000 in the home, they're going to get more money back than me, who is below $20,000 a year, just barely making it with two kids, single moms.

832
01:19:16,728 --> 01:19:20,689
So I mean, yes, they are putting in more money into the system.

833
01:19:20,709 --> 01:19:22,290
But no, it's not helping me.

834
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:25,831
Across the street is Bill's Burgers, where Roland Parker is grabbing a beer.

835
01:19:26,251 --> 01:19:27,811
He's a self-employed cabinetmaker.

836
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:30,352
He also didn't vote in the presidential election.

837
01:21:09,713 --> 01:21:15,597
It's certainly a big win, but certainly at the same time, Trump seems to be late to the party.

838
01:21:15,617 --> 01:21:21,301
You know, the interest rate hikes have begun, increases have begun, inflation is low, employment is up.

839
01:21:21,822 --> 01:21:30,668
Therefore, what Trump is offering is not some kind of a fixing of the problem, but more like an icing on the cake.

840
01:21:30,708 --> 01:21:34,751
He might like to tweet about it, but the problem doesn't need fixing anymore.

841
01:21:35,411 --> 01:21:49,186
But on the other hand, there are issues related to whether there is a demand in the economy to revive capital, because as of now, last night's report suggested some industries may not really gain, whereas some others will.

842
01:21:49,567 --> 01:21:55,914
And looking at a higher perspective, the real threats to jobs haven't gone away yet.

843
01:21:56,354 --> 01:22:00,299
You know, the middle class may get money back, but what about the Rust Belt?

844
01:22:01,781 --> 01:22:05,926
You know, there are robots, robotics coming in, there is 3D printing.

845
01:22:06,466 --> 01:22:12,053
These are technological issues that can't be simply solved by a silver bullet like a tax plan.

846
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:15,675
I want to ask, can I just ask you a quick comparison question?

847
01:22:15,715 --> 01:22:16,976
In fact, it comes in two parts.

848
01:22:17,156 --> 01:22:24,481
One is about the bureaucracy and the complications of filing for the IRS, which we heard about from Janet a moment ago.

849
01:22:24,501 --> 01:22:28,604
So let's do that bit first and tell me how that plays out in India.

850
01:22:28,624 --> 01:22:29,785
Then I'll get on to the other thing.

851
01:22:30,225 --> 01:22:33,208
Well, India is much more bureaucratic.

852
01:22:33,268 --> 01:22:34,910
In fact, India, the problem is opposite.

853
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:53,587
India has a very low tax-to-GDP ratio, and the government has been trying to make its own India's biggest tax reform in the past several decades by introducing what's called the goods and services tax, a single one for the entire nation, which the Prime Minister called a good and simple tax, but small businesses do not find it good or

854
01:22:53,927 --> 01:23:11,604
simple because it increases the complexities of filing electronic returns 13 times a year, some reliefs have been given, it's been a toing and froing between the government and the opposition and some of the tax rates are as high as 28% and apart from that there is this whole cumbersome, you know, things like

855
01:23:12,745 --> 01:23:14,867
eBay bills and papers you have to maintain.

856
01:23:15,247 --> 01:23:18,089
So nobody's liking the complexity or the tax rate.

857
01:23:18,389 --> 01:23:26,014
And it was an election issue that the Prime Minister's BJP managed to somehow beat in this week's elections, last week's elections.

858
01:23:26,754 --> 01:23:36,500
And to that extent, the government is safe, but it's quite shaken by some of these tax initiatives, which it says will benefit India in the long run.

859
01:23:36,601 --> 01:23:38,302
But, you know, no one's really seen the long run.

860
01:23:39,122 --> 01:23:42,264
OK, we'll come back to this in the second half of the programme.

861
01:23:42,365 --> 01:23:42,925
Thanks both.

862
01:23:43,085 --> 01:23:44,206
Andy, hold fire.

863
01:23:44,226 --> 01:23:46,908
I know you've got a lot more to say about this.

864
01:23:46,928 --> 01:23:52,052
I want to look into some other news now here on business matters.

865
01:23:52,072 --> 01:23:53,092
We're going to go to Spain.

866
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:58,096
The northern region of Catalonia has seen a lot of campaigning in the last few weeks.

867
01:23:58,296 --> 01:24:03,480
The election called by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy happens on Thursday.

868
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,001
Now, you'll remember we covered it on this programme.

869
01:24:06,281 --> 01:24:12,623
Catalonia's attempt to break away from Spain in the wake of that disputed referendum unleashed a real political storm.

870
01:24:13,143 --> 01:24:17,165
The former president of the regions is still in exile in Belgium.

871
01:24:17,465 --> 01:24:19,606
A lot of his colleagues are in prison.

872
01:24:19,986 --> 01:24:23,967
And the Spanish government has introduced direct rule across Catalonia.

873
01:24:24,328 --> 01:24:27,749
Let's hear now from the BBC's Guy Hedgcoe in Barcelona.

874
01:24:29,547 --> 01:24:34,488
I'm on the Ramblas, the boulevard in central Barcelona that's such a magnet for tourists.

875
01:24:35,409 --> 01:24:39,050
Barcelona receives around 17 million tourists each year.

876
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:47,592
But in October, tourist arrivals fell by 5 percent, a dip which has been attributed to the political turmoil here during that month.

877
01:24:48,492 --> 01:24:55,674
In addition, around 3,000 companies have moved their legal base out of Catalonia to other parts of Spain recently.

878
01:24:56,134 --> 01:25:01,576
The firm Help My Cash, which compares financial services, is one of those that made the move.

879
01:25:01,916 --> 01:25:03,797
Laurent Amar is its founder.

880
01:25:04,437 --> 01:25:07,338
In September, we were in a very uncertain environment.

881
01:25:07,418 --> 01:25:12,820
We were not able to clearly say what was going to happen, so we had to move the

882
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:16,102
legal headquarter out of Catalonia.

883
01:25:16,302 --> 01:25:21,044
We have one of our shareholders who lives in Madrid so it made sense to be there.

884
01:25:21,224 --> 01:25:26,467
Mr. Amar says the economic impact of the political instability was easy to gauge.

885
01:25:27,348 --> 01:25:33,371
What we saw was a huge spike in traffic from people who were looking for where to put your money.

886
01:25:33,731 --> 01:25:34,852
From one day to the other,

887
01:25:35,452 --> 01:25:47,887
The number of users who were concerned about bank account exploded and the number of people who were looking for mortgages shrank because basically the whole mortgage business in Catalonia froze.

888
01:25:48,328 --> 01:25:55,016
And so since October we've seen a drastic reduction in the number of people who come and look for mortgages in Catalonia.

889
01:25:56,632 --> 01:26:00,993
Politically, Catalonia is much calmer now than it was just a few weeks ago.

890
01:26:01,473 --> 01:26:11,315
And certainly, it does look pretty much like business as usual, even though you can still see quite a few pro-independence flags hanging from balconies of apartments.

891
01:26:12,156 --> 01:26:16,917
But there are concerns that the effects for the economy could still be felt for some time.

892
01:26:17,537 --> 01:26:26,299
I'm in the commercial district of central Barcelona, where Carlos Ribadulla, a businessman who has been very critical of the independence movement, has his offices.

893
01:26:27,079 --> 01:26:32,402
Since September, October, November, we've been experiencing here in Catalonia a very dramatic economic turmoil.

894
01:26:32,702 --> 01:26:45,949
For instance, we've seen consumption going down, where in the rest of Spain it's going up about 20% for restaurants, 25% for cinemas and shows, 25% for big department stores.

895
01:26:46,129 --> 01:26:50,752
Are these elections going to solve the crisis, calm down the turmoil, do you think?

896
01:26:51,512 --> 01:26:52,913
Sure, at least they might.

897
01:26:52,994 --> 01:26:59,380
We have a choice, we have an option, I mean, an opportunity on December the 21st with the coming elections.

898
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:09,409
If we have a clear majority of pro-unity, pro-constitutional parties, yes, we'll have more stability, confidence and trust will be regained.

899
01:27:13,153 --> 01:27:19,119
But polls suggest that pro-independence parties could win more seats than the unionists in the election.

900
01:27:19,739 --> 01:27:29,829
This campaign advert featuring deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont speaking from exile in Belgium presents the vote as another referendum on the independence issue.

901
01:27:31,130 --> 01:27:35,712
Ernest Maragall is a candidate for the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left Party.

902
01:27:36,392 --> 01:27:45,216
He says that if Madrid agreed to engage in negotiations about the territorial issue, the political and economic situation would improve dramatically.

903
01:27:45,656 --> 01:27:52,259
If we had just normal dialogue at the table, the social and economic effects would disappear immediately.

904
01:27:52,419 --> 01:27:58,522
Imagine now, after the election of the 21st of December, the Spanish state would accept

905
01:27:59,102 --> 01:28:02,063
that the best way is a real dialogue with Catalonia.

906
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:09,125
Then it would have an immediate and spectacular effect in terms of calming all the instability.

907
01:28:09,265 --> 01:28:16,347
But the Spanish government looks unlikely to engage in talks with Catalonia's pro-independence forces anytime soon.

908
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:27,910
Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy insists that he will continue to defend the unity of Spain against those who want to break away.

909
01:28:28,983 --> 01:28:39,932
Although pro-independence parties might win the election, they could fall short of a majority, in which case it could be up to a coalition of left-leaning parties to decide who governs.

910
01:28:41,913 --> 01:28:50,720
The full results of the election will be known on the same day that the annual Christmas lottery is held in Spain, and with tickets on sale in the street.

911
01:28:51,721 --> 01:28:56,384
But this election, called by Mr Rajoy, might be his biggest gamble yet.

912
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:03,001
Guy Hedgcoe reporting from Barcelona.

913
01:29:03,041 --> 01:29:09,684
Of course, from Thursday on, we'll be bringing you results of that election in Catalonia here at the BBC World Service.

914
01:29:10,105 --> 01:29:13,266
Much more to come on this edition of Business Matters.

915
01:29:13,646 --> 01:29:16,608
Before the end of the hour, we're going to be talking about the ownership

916
01:29:17,068 --> 01:29:37,435
of the Carolina Panthers, why an NFL franchise is political, it's got race politics in it as well, there's the hashtag MeToo debate involved, it's stirring up a lot of contemporary American themes in one big package, and there is a lot of money at stake.

917
01:29:41,096 --> 01:29:42,857
This is the BBC World Service.

918
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:45,738
The news is in a couple of minutes, but first, music.

919
01:29:46,918 --> 01:29:51,400
Amsahar Zand and this month's Global Beats features musicians from Iran.

920
01:29:52,901 --> 01:29:57,442
It's a country with a long tradition of music.

921
01:29:57,622 --> 01:30:02,785
To me, the sound is very fulfilling, very human, and it speaks to my soul.

922
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:07,046
But it's also a place where strict rules are enforced.

923
01:30:07,106 --> 01:30:11,608
You have to actually record a video and send it to the Ministry of Culture.

924
01:30:11,808 --> 01:30:15,450
They need to know what kind of text you're singing and how you are performing it.

925
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:27,109
From the cool jazz tones of Gulnar Shahriar to the experimental electronic music of Sot.

926
01:30:30,993 --> 01:30:34,216
Join me for some new and exciting sounds from Iran.

927
01:30:34,717 --> 01:30:39,662
Global Beats at bbcworldservice.com slash bbcmusic

928
01:30:46,129 --> 01:30:46,650
Welcome back.

929
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:47,771
You're with Business Matters.

930
01:30:48,071 --> 01:30:51,555
And still to come, China announces a new carbon market.

931
01:30:51,795 --> 01:30:54,878
Is it an environmental initiative that's finally catching on?

932
01:30:55,479 --> 01:31:01,485
From Oregon, we'll meet the Zebra entrepreneurs, business people of a different stripe.

933
01:31:01,746 --> 01:31:03,748
And Diddy bids for the Panthers.

934
01:31:04,248 --> 01:31:07,652
Will he become the NFL's first black franchise owner?

935
01:31:11,587 --> 01:31:13,348
BBC News with Marion Marshall.

936
01:31:13,789 --> 01:31:16,731
US senators are debating the Trump administration's tax bill.

937
01:31:17,252 --> 01:31:23,277
The House of Representatives earlier approved the bill that would see the biggest overhaul of the country's tax system in decades.

938
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:30,443
If the legislation passes in the Senate, it'll have to be sent back to the House for another vote because of a last-minute procedural glitch.

939
01:31:31,550 --> 01:31:41,062
The defeated candidate in the fiercely disputed presidential elections in Honduras, Salvador Nasralla, has accepted an invitation for talks with the president, Juan Orlando Hernandez.

940
01:31:41,643 --> 01:31:46,409
Mr Nasralla has accused his rival of rigging the vote and says he's taped evidence of this.

941
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:57,040
Twelve people have been killed in the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, when a bus carrying foreign tourists to see Mayan ruins veered off the road and toppled over.

942
01:31:57,581 --> 01:32:02,426
Eighteen passengers were injured and have been taken to hospital, but they're said to be in a stable condition.

943
01:32:03,785 --> 01:32:12,438
Canada and the United States will co-host a summit of foreign ministers to discuss the effectiveness of current measures to curb North Korea's nuclear ambitions.

944
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:17,726
The meeting in Vancouver next month will include envoys from Japan and South Korea.

945
01:32:19,087 --> 01:32:19,447
The U.S.

946
01:32:19,507 --> 01:32:28,953
ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has said a missile fired at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, bears the hallmarks of an attack using weapons provided by Iran.

947
01:32:29,533 --> 01:32:34,195
The Saudi military shot down the missile, which Houthi rebels in Yemen say they launched.

948
01:32:35,296 --> 01:32:43,360
China has unveiled plans for a nationwide carbon market, allowing companies to trade permissions to emit greenhouse gases within an overall cap.

949
01:32:43,981 --> 01:32:46,582
The carbon market will cover the emissions of about 1,700 energy companies.

950
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:55,243
Austria's new chancellor has travelled to Brussels to reassure EU leaders that his government is committed to the bloc.

951
01:32:55,843 --> 01:33:05,867
Sebastian Kurz, who leads the Conservative People's Party, has entered an alliance with the Eurosceptic and Anti-Immigration Freedom Party, sparking alarm in Brussels.

952
01:33:07,428 --> 01:33:08,348
BBC News.

953
01:33:16,047 --> 01:33:16,928
Hello, welcome back.

954
01:33:17,048 --> 01:33:19,150
Business Matters with Fergus Nicol.

955
01:33:19,510 --> 01:33:27,598
And now China has unveiled plans to set up a national carbon market in a bid to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

956
01:33:28,219 --> 01:33:33,704
This market would bring about a quarter of the world's emissions under some kind of trading system.

957
01:33:34,104 --> 01:33:37,708
Zhang Yong is the vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission.

958
01:33:38,128 --> 01:33:40,511
He says the trading will be based in Shanghai.

959
01:33:41,171 --> 01:33:44,553
It will involve more than 1,700 power companies.

960
01:33:45,373 --> 01:33:53,197
Paula de Perna is an environmental analyst who helped set up the pilot scheme on behalf of the Chinese government that led to this announcement.

961
01:33:53,497 --> 01:33:55,418
She's been talking to my colleague Tim Franks.

962
01:33:56,229 --> 01:34:06,813
The Chinese system will be covering the power sector, which is, of course, the source of a lot of emissions, and will have an impact not only on the reduction of emissions, but also on the cost of energy.

963
01:34:07,013 --> 01:34:23,199
What's critical about today's announcement is that it's a commitment to put this system into place, which puts on notice the rest of the world, especially existing carbon markets in the European Union and California, that there will be potential to link up with the Chinese market, and that's a very big deal.

964
01:34:23,499 --> 01:34:26,663
The potential for linkage establishes an international language.

965
01:34:26,723 --> 01:34:39,299
If you think of a carbon ton, if you think of an emissions allowance as a new form of currency, as an international translation of environmental science from science to finance, that's really what's exciting about all this.

966
01:34:39,839 --> 01:34:46,223
I think the Chinese entry into this new world of commodities trading requires them to play by the rules.

967
01:34:46,403 --> 01:34:54,227
And so if they were to try to game such a system, which is under such an international microscope, it would be a very significant national embarrassment.

968
01:34:54,268 --> 01:34:58,170
Now, that doesn't mean there won't be mistakes and there won't be probably some cheating.

969
01:34:58,210 --> 01:35:03,553
But I think overall, it's a step into best practice at the financial services level.

970
01:35:03,933 --> 01:35:11,855
And given how major an emitter of carbon China is, what sort of impact do you think this could have globally?

971
01:35:12,115 --> 01:35:15,656
Well, I think it could have transformational impact in numerous ways.

972
01:35:15,716 --> 01:35:19,337
First of all, the obvious, most important one is to actually reduce the emissions.

973
01:35:19,437 --> 01:35:27,238
So if the Chinese power sector becomes comfortable with the rules and begins to understand it, they could get into it big time and they like to trade.

974
01:35:27,299 --> 01:35:32,640
And so it could become quite significant that they're playing an internal competition game of who can reduce quickest.

975
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:33,700
And then secondly,

976
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:38,122
all companies that operate in China use power in one way or another.

977
01:35:38,202 --> 01:35:44,144
So if the power sector is coming under control of the cap and trade, the users of power will feel the impact.

978
01:35:44,424 --> 01:35:52,347
So it means that American companies, European companies, any company in China will feel the effects of this cap and trade indirectly.

979
01:35:52,547 --> 01:35:57,329
And that can be good because you can never have too much efficiency when it comes to energy use.

980
01:35:57,429 --> 01:36:00,730
So if the system works as it can, it could be very significant.

981
01:36:01,907 --> 01:36:03,768
Thanks to Paula de Perna.

982
01:36:04,088 --> 01:36:06,348
A transformational impact then.

983
01:36:06,388 --> 01:36:13,471
Let me reintroduce from New Delhi this morning, Madhavan Narayanan of FirstPost.com, Andy Euler of Marketplace in Austin.

984
01:36:13,491 --> 01:36:20,973
I don't suppose you want to step in here, Andy, with a crystal clear definition of what this involves, because, you know, people have been talking about this for a long time.

985
01:36:21,013 --> 01:36:25,495
I remember going to Brazil, oh God, must be 10, 12 years ago, people talking about it.

986
01:36:25,515 --> 01:36:29,416
It just hasn't caught on at the scale that the Green Movement hoped it would.

987
01:36:29,916 --> 01:36:34,579
Well, and what stuck with me, too, was what Paula DiPerna said right at the end.

988
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:42,906
She said, if this market works, which is really important, because there are three things that this carbon market needs.

989
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:47,369
It has to know how much carbon is being emitted and where it's coming from.

990
01:36:48,610 --> 01:36:55,515
You need to have some sort of registry to figure out where it is coming from and who to hold accountable for that.

991
01:36:57,215 --> 01:37:03,598
And then you also have to think about how much this carbon is going to cost.

992
01:37:03,618 --> 01:37:05,579
You have to have sort of a market for it.

993
01:37:05,979 --> 01:37:08,240
And none of these things right now exist.

994
01:37:08,260 --> 01:37:12,361
I mean, the idea that China's going to come in and set up this carbon market is great.

995
01:37:12,621 --> 01:37:14,122
I agree with her.

996
01:37:14,182 --> 01:37:15,362
I think this is a great thing.

997
01:37:15,402 --> 01:37:16,663
But at the same time,

998
01:37:17,243 --> 01:37:22,566
This is going to have a long, long rollout process, because we're going to have to figure out all of the other things.

999
01:37:22,926 --> 01:37:24,907
You can say, all right, this carpet market's open.

1000
01:37:24,927 --> 01:37:27,328
Now we've got to figure out how we're actually going to do it.

1001
01:37:27,349 --> 01:37:31,591
Do you buy the premise, Madhavan, of this conceptually?

1002
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:42,695
Yes, I do, except that look at the challenges in trying to buy something out of someone for something that person didn't do.

1003
01:37:43,055 --> 01:37:45,376
That's what carbon emissions trading is all about.

1004
01:37:45,416 --> 01:37:47,917
So it's like buying a vacuum sort of a thing.

1005
01:37:47,937 --> 01:37:49,738
You know, I didn't do this, so pay me for it.

1006
01:37:49,818 --> 01:37:51,539
It's a bit of a ransom thing, if you ask me.

1007
01:37:52,039 --> 01:38:03,590
But there's also the irony that we're talking more of bitcoins than carbon trading, whereas carbon trading is actually producing social and ecological value.

1008
01:38:03,811 --> 01:38:07,935
Yeah, I was wondering whether carbon trading would ever become as sexy as bitcoin trading.

1009
01:38:08,495 --> 01:38:19,877
Yeah, there is a case to make it sexy, but as Andy said, you know, we need to have policing mechanisms to ensure that somebody is actually reducing emissions and therefore is worth paying for that.

1010
01:38:20,277 --> 01:38:27,298
India took baby steps around circa 2008 to list and authorize certain companies to do it.

1011
01:38:27,758 --> 01:38:35,600
But, you know, the global economic crisis and the collapse of Lehman Brothers took our attention away from climate change towards Wall Street.

1012
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:36,640
of the

1013
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:54,374
some incentives out of carbon trading on the one hand.

1014
01:38:54,434 --> 01:38:59,958
On the other hand, you have alternatives in form of everything from electric cars to solar energy to switch over.

1015
01:39:00,398 --> 01:39:08,244
This is a glorious dawn, if I may say so, for what I call green pricing or greenomics.

1016
01:39:08,824 --> 01:39:12,127
And I do hope the governments move faster on this.

1017
01:39:12,427 --> 01:39:15,209
My belief is that no government is moving fast enough on this.

1018
01:39:15,489 --> 01:39:39,150
And Andy, probably the good news about this with China's involvement, as we're hearing from Paul, it sets an example that the others can buy into and indeed tie into, but it also perhaps stops richer countries kind of effectively buying out their guilt by attributing it to somebody else, playing a market in a fairly cavalier way and buying themselves out of these kind of caps.

1019
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:48,239
Well, and it's also this idea that China is now going to be, perhaps, the global leader in reducing carbon emissions.

1020
01:39:48,299 --> 01:39:52,403
I mean, the United States, it doesn't feel like that's a priority here.

1021
01:39:52,463 --> 01:40:00,691
From everybody that you talk to, everybody that you're hearing politically, it doesn't feel like carbon emissions is one of the things that we talk about.

1022
01:40:00,731 --> 01:40:01,772
I mean, we spent

1023
01:40:02,112 --> 01:40:04,374
the whole first half of the show talking about tax reform.

1024
01:40:04,955 --> 01:40:06,676
We're not talking about global warming.

1025
01:40:06,696 --> 01:40:07,837
We're not talking about climate change.

1026
01:40:07,857 --> 01:40:09,178
We're not talking about carbon emissions.

1027
01:40:09,699 --> 01:40:25,032
And so if China's going to step in and be the global leader, I hope, from what it appears to me, that other rich countries are going to pay attention and say, you know what, if there's a market for this, of course, the American says, if there's a market for this, we're going to get in on it.

1028
01:40:25,553 --> 01:40:28,135
Because if there is that carbon market, of course America's going to get in on it.

1029
01:40:28,595 --> 01:40:33,800
Hold the thought about Bitcoin, by the way, folks, because we're coming back to that before the end of the half hour.

1030
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,241
This is Business Matters.

1031
01:40:35,301 --> 01:40:37,263
We are live on the BBC.

1032
01:40:37,283 --> 01:40:43,048
Now, if you're running a startup in America and you're looking for investment, it helps if you're a man.

1033
01:40:43,268 --> 01:40:49,353
Between 2011 and 2013, $51 billion of venture capital poured into U.S.

1034
01:40:49,413 --> 01:40:54,778
companies, but only 3% of that went to companies led by a female CEO.

1035
01:40:55,298 --> 01:40:58,661
Findings published, by the way, in the journal Venture Capital.

1036
01:40:59,101 --> 01:41:04,845
If you're female and you're from an ethnic minority, well, then the prospects of raising money get even bleaker.

1037
01:41:05,085 --> 01:41:08,828
But now a group of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley is trying to do something about it.

1038
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:15,053
The BBC's Riga Morris went along to the first meeting of so-called zebras in Portland, Oregon.

1039
01:41:16,065 --> 01:41:18,426
Zebras fix what unicorns break.

1040
01:41:19,086 --> 01:41:22,267
That's the motto of a movement in Silicon Valley's tech industry.

1041
01:41:23,048 --> 01:41:27,269
It may sound like marketing nonsense, but the movement is dead serious.

1042
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:34,112
The zebras are frustrated by what they see as a lust for so-called unicorn companies.

1043
01:41:34,632 --> 01:41:36,753
Right now, unicorns is a popular

1044
01:41:37,293 --> 01:41:42,818
title for companies that are valued at over a billion dollars, and Silicon Valley is chasing after these.

1045
01:41:42,838 --> 01:41:49,925
You know, there aren't a ton in existence, but they're enough to make people kind of gold rush hungry for finding the next unicorn company.

1046
01:41:50,005 --> 01:41:51,186
That's Jennifer Brandel.

1047
01:41:51,226 --> 01:41:57,231
She's one of the founders of the Zebra Movement, which aims to change the way tech startups are funded.

1048
01:41:57,992 --> 01:42:07,839
It's very hard to find investors who aren't thinking about striking it rich, especially because now with technology, companies can scale very quickly sometimes, sometimes too quickly for their own good.

1049
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:10,441
And so zebras are an alternative.

1050
01:42:10,481 --> 01:42:18,126
Instead of a unicorn, which is mythical and rarely seen, zebras are actually real and they get their competitive advantage from cooperating.

1051
01:42:18,306 --> 01:42:27,033
Unicorns, I think, are dangerous in that they grow up so quickly and before they've had a chance to really understand the power that they wield and how to do it responsibly.

1052
01:42:30,174 --> 01:42:33,956
I went to the zebras first ever gathering, DazzleCon.

1053
01:42:38,317 --> 01:42:43,039
It's called DazzleCon because a group of zebras is known as a dazzle.

1054
01:42:43,579 --> 01:42:43,980
It's true.

1055
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,960
I looked it up.

1056
01:42:46,098 --> 01:42:49,220
But this isn't your standard Silicon Valley tech conference.

1057
01:42:49,340 --> 01:42:51,802
First of all, the guests are predominantly women.

1058
01:42:52,463 --> 01:42:57,907
And secondly, the chat isn't the standard Silicon Valley grow fast or die trying.

1059
01:42:58,848 --> 01:43:07,694
At DazzleCon, they're talking about social impact, sustainability, and about how women receive less than 10% of all venture capital funding in Silicon Valley.

1060
01:43:07,714 --> 01:43:09,295
Thank you so much.

1061
01:43:09,315 --> 01:43:15,340
Ania Williams joined the Zebra movement as a co-founder after struggling to raise money for her wearable tech company, Tinsel.

1062
01:43:15,740 --> 01:43:20,725
I pitched over 100 investors and at the end of the day I ended up landing two.

1063
01:43:21,706 --> 01:43:26,631
And I realized that there were a lot of issues with the way that the VC model works.

1064
01:43:26,731 --> 01:43:28,313
I think that the model is very broken.

1065
01:43:28,353 --> 01:43:34,539
I think that obviously it favors a specific type of person over everyone else.

1066
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:36,522
Do you mean white male?

1067
01:43:36,862 --> 01:43:38,504
Well, you know, you said it.

1068
01:43:40,104 --> 01:43:41,585
One of the zebras is Tara Reid.

1069
01:43:41,865 --> 01:43:43,705
She's the founder of Apps Without Code.

1070
01:43:44,526 --> 01:43:49,828
She says the zebra movement is important, but that it could only exist in the tech industry.

1071
01:43:50,068 --> 01:43:54,009
This distinction between zebras and unicorns, this is only a tech conversation.

1072
01:43:54,370 --> 01:43:58,851
If you have conversations with any other industry, right, what you want to be is a zebra.

1073
01:43:58,891 --> 01:43:59,492
That's normal.

1074
01:43:59,532 --> 01:44:00,732
That's how businesses work.

1075
01:44:01,112 --> 01:44:05,554
For some reason in tech, we have this different idea of how business works, right?

1076
01:44:05,874 --> 01:44:10,117
Well, it's because we have these fairy tales of boys in their dorm rooms becoming billionaires.

1077
01:44:10,177 --> 01:44:21,786
Right, but I think if you hear the fairy tales in other industries, like the fairy tale is Pepsi or Coca-Cola, the fairy tale is some other business that generates profit and distributes that profit.

1078
01:44:21,926 --> 01:44:23,227
Those are the different fairy tales.

1079
01:44:23,467 --> 01:44:27,691
So I think outside of Silicon Valley, this is, of course, it's normal.

1080
01:44:27,751 --> 01:44:33,195
So I think the zebra movement will mainly exist in Silicon Valley because that's what the rest of the world is doing.

1081
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:38,694
That's the BBC's Riga Morris meeting members of the Zebra Gathering.

1082
01:44:38,714 --> 01:44:41,216
It happened in Portland, Oregon.

1083
01:44:41,457 --> 01:44:45,080
DazzleCon 2017 was the title.

1084
01:44:45,220 --> 01:44:47,302
What's the collective noun for unicorns?

1085
01:44:47,882 --> 01:44:50,365
At Fergus Nicol, if you know the answer.

1086
01:44:50,645 --> 01:44:52,406
Madhavan, would this work in India?

1087
01:44:52,687 --> 01:44:53,688
Do you buy that concept?

1088
01:44:54,564 --> 01:45:10,679
Well, I just heard an interesting story last week about a venture capital meeting that took place in Delhi in which an investor bluntly told a woman that he will not invest in a company founded by a lady who would take six months off for maternity.

1089
01:45:11,180 --> 01:45:14,023
So basically we are looking at asking

1090
01:45:14,843 --> 01:45:17,625
bungee jumpers to help a blind woman cross the road.

1091
01:45:17,705 --> 01:45:26,309
I mean, to draw an analogy between, you know, this is about greed and scale and value and as, you know, it could be a very white male thing, but this is about capitalism.

1092
01:45:26,829 --> 01:45:28,230
So zebra is a great idea.

1093
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:34,133
First of all, it creates a wonderful zebra versus unicorn debate to raise awareness on this issue.

1094
01:45:34,693 --> 01:45:42,461
But I have a feeling that the answers do not lie in conventional venture capital, but probably in three other things that are already there.

1095
01:45:42,841 --> 01:45:44,883
One is boutique investments.

1096
01:45:45,384 --> 01:45:52,331
The other is impact investment, which is an offshoot of venture capital that looks at social goals rather than economic scaling.

1097
01:45:52,811 --> 01:45:54,893
And the third would be philanthropy.

1098
01:45:55,233 --> 01:46:04,901
You know, there's a lot of money going on in philanthropy and some of those funds could be put into helping minorities and women and entrepreneurs of a different kind so that they can co-exist.

1099
01:46:05,281 --> 01:46:08,364
You know, one of the Silicon Valley's favorite word is ecosystem.

1100
01:46:08,904 --> 01:46:21,792
Maybe there isn't category for an ecosystem, but having said that, let me joke that in this whole zebra thing, everything is not in black and white, there are grey areas, and the zebras will have to earn their stripes.

1101
01:46:23,093 --> 01:46:25,694
Okay, pile them in, pile them in.

1102
01:46:25,954 --> 01:46:26,855
That's very interesting.

1103
01:46:26,955 --> 01:46:29,196
I like the point about social entrepreneurship.

1104
01:46:29,236 --> 01:46:32,198
That's something we can do in more detail, I think, on this program in the future.

1105
01:46:32,218 --> 01:46:33,119
That's a great point.

1106
01:46:33,659 --> 01:46:35,221
to make a marker.

1107
01:46:35,321 --> 01:46:46,795
Andy, we heard there from the women talking to Reagan in Silicon Valley itself and that thing going on in Portland, that this is something they're focused on their area.

1108
01:46:47,136 --> 01:46:48,518
Can it translate across America?

1109
01:46:49,218 --> 01:47:11,682
I don't know because it still feels like, I mean, you talk to, we have a technology reporter, a tech reporter, Molly Wood, who talks about, she spends a lot, I mean, she lives in San Francisco and spends a lot of time in Silicon Valley and talks about sort of the ecosystem, like we were talking about, being basically a lot like the priesthood, a lot, very male and a lot of white males.

1110
01:47:12,462 --> 01:47:17,903
And so when you get into these meetings, so many female entrepreneurs are getting into these meetings.

1111
01:47:19,643 --> 01:47:25,025
They're not being listened to or they're just being told no.

1112
01:47:25,085 --> 01:47:28,186
Is that Silicon Valley or is that the VC sector?

1113
01:47:29,727 --> 01:47:34,048
It feels like it is sort of the VC sector and it feels like so much of that money

1114
01:47:35,149 --> 01:47:41,094
is with a certain set of people who invest in other people that look like them.

1115
01:47:41,114 --> 01:47:45,258
I mean, you know, it's sort of the idea of shuffling that money around.

1116
01:47:45,858 --> 01:47:56,528
It doesn't feel like Silicon Valley is much different from other places in the United States where there's a ton of money and there's a ton of really powerful people that are shuffling that money around.

1117
01:47:56,928 --> 01:48:05,531
OK, we talked earlier in the program, guys, about Bitcoin, and we're going to talk in more detail now, because Asia has been at the forefront of the cryptocurrency craze.

1118
01:48:05,571 --> 01:48:16,276
Investors in Japan, China, South Korea driving up the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum and the others compared to traditional investments, let alone good old cash.

1119
01:48:16,356 --> 01:48:19,297
Cryptocurrencies are still pretty niche.

1120
01:48:20,058 --> 01:48:25,588
But the hype seems to have a lot more Asians interested in this market.

1121
01:48:26,028 --> 01:48:33,442
Now, we've been trying to make connection with our Asia business correspondent, Karishma Vaswani, joining us, we hope, this morning from Singapore.
