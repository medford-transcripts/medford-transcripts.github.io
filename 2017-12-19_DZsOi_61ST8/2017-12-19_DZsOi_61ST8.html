    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=662.921s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=664.482s">We</a>  do have a resident that would like a few minutes to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=667.724s">I</a>  know it's give us an update on what's going on in the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=673.707s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=675.067s">Yes,</a>  my name is Farina Buller. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=676.568s">I</a>  live at 9 Alfred Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=679.089s">I</a>  was here a couple of weeks ago and I just like to personally thank everybody here for getting this ball rolling in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=686.533s">I</a>  had a positive attitude about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=689.295s">We</a>  got a cease and desist order. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=692.224s">and</a>  I thought we were gonna give this thing a nice nap and have a nice Christmas, but unfortunately, I have some bad news. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=701.366s">First</a>  of all, nothing has stopped, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=705.768s">They</a>  continually work, and I have the documentation, the videos, they have continually worked for every Saturday since I've been here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=715.15s">I</a>  had the Medford Police come by on a Saturday, December 9th, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=719.351s">door</a>  wide open, grinding, Councilors, Scapelli here, drove by, luckily he just told me, and saw them working on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=730.498s">So</a>  it's been very frustrating, and I know things aren't gonna happen in one day, two days, so I didn't wanna come here a week later, I figured I'd wait a week or so to see what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=740.985s">Well,</a>  things have gotten progressively worse over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=744.03s">They're</a>  still coming in early in the morning, but now what they do is they park their cars around the other side of the building because thinking that I don't see any cars there that, you know, they're not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=756.207s">Another</a>  problem I have is I went down to the building commissioner's office today, and what I wanted was some clarification on a cease and desist order, which I looked up in the dictionary, it says stop work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=774.813s">I'm</a>  not an attorney, I'm just saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=777.294s">So</a>  Mr. Motley wasn't there, but when I went there today, John Bufuso was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=785.596s">And</a>  I asked him a few questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=787.778s">My</a>  first question was, do you have a copy of the cease and desist order? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=794.041s">I</a>  don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=795.022s">I</a>  said, well, you know who has it? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=796.863s">He</a>  says, Paul has. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=798.224s">Can</a>  you guys speak to Paul? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=799.585s">Paul</a>  ain't in right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=801.446s">And</a>  then I asked him for some clarification, which, you know, really concerns me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=806.689s">And</a>  he said, Paul isn't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=808.87s">So</a>  I was a little aggravated at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=811.972s">because</a>  I took time off of my work, not that I get paid millions of dollars, but I took time out of my day to go over it just to get something resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=819.736s">I</a>  went up to the mayor's office, unannounced, which I don't blame her, she was in a meeting, sorry, but she couldn't speak to me, that's totally understandable, I didn't even expect to see her, I just wanted to let her know I was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=830.901s">She</a>  was nice enough to have called Mr. Moakley, who I just left the office, wasn't in, came right up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=839.565s">I</a>  try to get some clarification on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=842.306s">He</a>  couldn't give me a straight answer on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=844.666s">Everything's</a>  kind of like a riddle to me on the answers I got back. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=849.027s">One</a>  of the things that really, I need a clarification on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=853.729s">I</a>  have this paper here from the Board of Appeals that was written, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=858.01s">And</a>  I highlighted what it says because I keep getting the wording that, oh, this, even though it was written to Steve Nardone, it's transferable to the tenant who's over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=869.412s">Okay,</a>  and with that being said, I just want to go back a step. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=876.697s">Mr.</a>  Moakley, in his words, agreed that this company, J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=881.68s">White,</a>  is in violation of doing this type of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=885.482s">Those</a>  are his words, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=888.003s">You</a>  know, this place was supposed to be for parking, for storage, not for industrial heavy-duty pipe manufacturing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=896.067s">But</a>  with that being said, what really bothered me was it says on the paper here, it says the Board of Appeals also calls the attention of the owner of the application that General Laws Chapter 48, Section 11, the last paragraph, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=912.014s">provides</a>  that no variance or special permits of any extension, modifications, or renewal, therefore, shall take effect until a copy of the decision bearing the certification of the town within 21 days of it being filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=928.326s">So,</a>  I'm not an attorney, but this pretty much sounds like this isn't transferable, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=936.692s">But</a>  what I'm asking you is why, when I come here, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=942.337s">In</a>  front of you guys, you, excuse me, in front of everybody, you gave me the cease and desist order. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=950.104s">Now</a>  Mr. Moakley tells me the cease and desist order was given, now he couldn't give me a copy of it, but he said it was no work will be allowed before five o'clock, I'm sorry, before eight o'clock in the morning and not after five o'clock in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=965.844s">I</a>  mean, does that sound reasonable? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=968.549s">That's</a>  worse than useless. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=970.592s">Having</a>  somebody that's supposed to be a cease and desist means stop work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=973.978s">So</a>  you're saying they can only work between eight and five. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=979.395s">I</a>  don't know what to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=980.656s">You</a>  guys helped me out so much and now I'm up against this here and I don't understand the wording or any of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=986.838s">But</a>  it doesn't make no sense to me at all and most importantly I just want to say I have 40 people that I'm representing today that are not here because they don't even know I'm coming today because I don't have time today to go there and see all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1001.182s">But</a>  they all support me and we're all together on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1004.043s">And</a>  it's really aggravating that <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1006.604s">A</a>  company, J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1008.326s">White,</a>  can't find a place, and that's another thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1011.008s">I</a>  said, well when are they coming out? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1012.309s">When</a>  are they leaving? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1013.29s">He</a>  says, well they said by the end of February. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1014.831s">Do</a>  you have a date? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1015.572s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1016.232s">So</a>  again, we're at hearsay. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1018.574s">They're</a>  supposed to be out at the end of February. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1020.576s">A</a>  company, J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1021.537s">White,</a>  can't find a place to do a commercial business, heavy pipe manufacturing besides a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1029.503s">I'm</a>  not buying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1030.843s">And</a>  I need all of your support, maybe something we can do to get this resolved, because, you know, we have rights in this town, in this city, and our rights in my neighborhood, a residential neighborhood, are being violated on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1048.647s">And</a>  it's disgraceful, disgraceful, that I have to go down there and argue with somebody down in the building department, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1056.93s">John</a>  Bufuso told me they have a right to work on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1060.791s">I</a>  said, did you read the ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1062.031s">He</a>  goes, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1063.012s">Five</a>  minutes later, I see Paul, he says, oh no, they can't work on a Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1066.973s">I</a>  mean, does the left hand know what the right hand's doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1069.073s">This</a>  is the guy that's been out there five times. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1072.114s">Five</a>  times he's been out there, he hasn't seen any work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1074.915s">Hate</a>  to tell ya, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1076.575s">For</a>  the last two weeks, Winchester Street's been closed off. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1079.818s">No</a>  one can go up there, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1081.879s">And</a>  the problem's on Alfred Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1084.141s">Read</a>  the paperwork, Alfred Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1086.503s">Not</a>  Winchester Street, that's where you enter it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1088.925s">All</a>  the noise is coming out of Alfred Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1091.507s">So,</a>  I'm at wit's end here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1093.729s">I</a>  don't know why a company <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1098.733s">is</a>  coming into a town that did this to you to make money, do their pipe work, and get out, that they have no respect for the neighbors, no respect for the city, and why is the city allowing something like this to happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1110.48s">I</a>  don't get it, I don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1112.761s">And</a>  if you all can help me in some way, I very much appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1118.34s">Through</a>  the Chair, if I could ask a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1119.901s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1121.221s">Through</a>  the Chair, thank you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1123.862s">So</a>  they're working six days a week with the door open, are they still doing work outside or is it closed?</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1128.503s">Yes,</a>  they're still doing work outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1130.304s">I</a>  have video documentation and I'd just like to make it for the record that Mr. Moakley, I saw him up in the Mayor's office, I wanted to show him the video. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1139.767s">I</a>  said, well they're out there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1141.648s">You</a>  wanna see the video today at 1.30? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1143.688s">Here's</a>  some more grinding. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1144.669s">I</a>  mean, I don't wanna have to play this for ya. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1146.489s">I</a>  don't wanna see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1147.349s">Of</a>  course you don't wanna see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1149.93s">You</a>  know, I mean, how can you have a cease and desist order and say they can only work from eight to five? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1159.532s">Does</a>  that sound, seriously, I'm asking you all, does that sound fair or reasonable? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1163.573s">That's</a>  a slap in the face to me and the 40 other people that signed this paper.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1171.497s">Through</a>  the chair, it seems to me our 40 neighbors that are dealing with this have a right to be very frustrated and to get a date of maybe February.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1181.821s">And</a>  if, not even something, if. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1183.901s">I</a>  said, so did they give you anything in stone? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1186.202s">Well,</a>  they said. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1186.922s">I</a>  go, so that's hearsay, you know, hearsay. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1190.523s">I</a>  mean, they're a big contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1192.284s">I</a>  don't even think they're aware of what's going on, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1195.405s">That's</a>  what I think, because I don't think a company that big would want to be embarrassed so much for making fools out of himself in a city, in a residential neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1204.309s">I</a>  just can't believe it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1205.99s">What</a>  I can believe is down at that building department that someone's not doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1210.892s">How</a>  come he comes by and he sees it, and this guy comes by five times when the road's closed on Winchester Street, and he's never seen nothing? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1219.216s">I</a>  live next door, I'm not even home all day, and when I go home, that's all I see and hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1223.522s">So,</a>  you know, I'm not imagining anything, and neither are all the neighbors, you know?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1232.124s">I'd</a>  be happy to meet you here tomorrow at nine o'clock at the building office and go up there with you with the building inspector.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1237.488s">Well,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1239.27s">I</a>  just want to know that you're well respected by me and I find that everything you've done was being very disrespected and I just wanted you guys to acknowledge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1249.237s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1250.098s">If</a>  you'd like to meet me here tomorrow morning when the office opens.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1252.06s">I'd</a>  be there at nine o'clock, no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1253.841s">I'll</a>  meet you there the first thing in the morning and we'll go up there together. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1256.683s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1257.403s">Everybody</a>  have a nice Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1258.644s">Thank</a>  you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1259.664s">I</a>  think we need to get some clarification from ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1262.605s">I</a>  know Paul's responded to me in the last week because I've had some of your neighbors actually call and email with additional complaints, like you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1270.267s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1270.607s">It's</a>  work hasn't stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1271.927s">It's</a>  going on at all hours, inside, outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1276.068s">I</a>  did ask a couple questions to the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1281.452s">He</a>  did answer me back, but you're right, if we ask for a cease and desist, why are they allowed to operate?</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1287.015s">More</a>  importantly, what I'm concerned, can anybody get a clarification on if this ordinance was specifically for Nardone Electric, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1297.542s">And</a>  he doesn't operate the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1300.564s">And</a>  it says right in here, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1303.094s">that</a>  this can't be changed by anything unless it's in 21 days of writing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1307.635s">How</a>  is this happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1309.136s">I</a>  don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1310.336s">I</a>  don't get that at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1312.217s">I'm</a>  not an attorney.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1313.517s">Maybe</a>  we could give that to our messenger and get an opinion from our city solicitor, and if that's the case, if it's non-transferable, then the permit should be pulled, although we voted to cease and desist on this a couple weeks ago.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1329.726s">The</a>  conclusion was reached some weeks ago by the building commissioner that it's not transferable. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1334.83s">He</a>  made that clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1335.77s">Those</a>  are the grounds under which he's issued the cease and desist.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1339.233s">He's</a>  told me otherwise.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1343.096s">uh,</a>  recommendation that, uh, we, uh, require the building commissioner to, uh, pursue this, uh, to the greatest extent, uh, the law allows him, uh, to, uh, uh, deal with it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1355.349s">I</a>  mean, maybe you can work that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1357.772s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1359.213s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1360.715s">Um,</a>  Council, are you done? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1362.757s">For</a>  now.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1366.02s">I</a>  was supporting my colleague when we talked about getting this to the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1372.426s">I</a>  think that the message is clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1374.829s">I</a>  think that we've all spoken. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1376.51s">We</a>  support the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1378.492s">Like</a>  I said, we've seen the work and we've mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1380.834s">So</a>  I think that if we can do that, I know it's great that you can come out here tomorrow, but I think we need our legal team to work with our code enforcement <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1389.062s">to</a>  make sure both of them are doing what's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1391.804s">And</a>  if we need, then you need to get the chief of police involved and do what needs to be done for those residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1399.068s">I</a>  think it's very important that all three entities are contacted.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1405.131s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1406.872s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1408.774s">I</a>  agree with my colleagues, but I'd like to take it one step further. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1412.237s">I</a>  think we need to create an emergency committee of the whole meeting and meet with the city solicitor, as was mentioned, the building department, John Bavuso, and the building commissioner, Paul Moki, either meet on site or here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1426.388s">I</a>  would prefer that we meet on site, Mr. President, and this needs to take place immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1432.754s">So,</a>  I would ask that <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1434.855s">I</a>  would ask that you set up an emergency meeting, Mr. President, to go on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1439.94s">This</a>  is, as Fran mentioned, this has been going on far too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1445.005s">I</a>  thought the cease and desist order, in my opinion, how it's always worked in this city, that stops all work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1451.471s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1452.512s">That's</a>  why I couldn't understand why you would have a cease and desist from 8 to 5.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1457.416s">And</a>  the reason why you do that is to bring all parties to the table, because once you stop work, J.F. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1463.02s">White's</a>  going to say, what's going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1465.302s">And</a>  they're going to want to be at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1466.523s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1467.143s">If</a>  you allow them to do business as usual between those hours, because in my opinion, the city didn't do you any favors eight to five.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1474.989s">Oh,</a>  you guys did your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1476.21s">I</a>  just want to tell you, I'm very happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1477.851s">And</a>  unfortunately, I waited and I knew it wasn't going to happen overnight, but nothing has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1483.655s">Nothing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1484.095s">That's</a>  why I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1484.995s">I'm</a>  not here to ruin everybody's day.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1487.756s">And</a>  our job is to make sure the residents have a peace of mind and a quality of life that they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1494.918s">So</a>  I would ask, Mr. President, that you call for that meeting immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1499.159s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1502.03s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1502.951s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1504.353s">Brian,</a>  I thank you for coming down again to give us an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1506.617s">It's</a>  my pleasure, Mr. Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1508.359s">You</a>  live in this neighborhood, you experience this on a daily basis, and this is a quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1512.886s">You</a>  shouldn't be impacted like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1513.988s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1514.388s">And</a>  your neighbors shouldn't either. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1516.992s">You</a>  know, I agree with my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1518.372s">I</a>  think an emergency meeting is called for in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1521.033s">I</a>  mean, this is something that needs to stop and it needs to stop now. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1524.855s">The</a>  questions that I have and that I would like to hear back is why were the limitations put on the cease and desist order? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1530.657s">Who</a>  actually put limitations saying between these hours and these hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1534.278s">I</a>  agree with my console colleague here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1536.559s">Stop</a>  work means stop work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1538.5s">That</a>  means shut it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1540.677s">and</a>  that's what people react and that's what people come to the table to come up with some sort of a resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1546.198s">February,</a>  once you get to February, they're gonna say, well, we'll find a new place by March.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1550.159s">We'll</a>  find a new place by May. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1551.539s">Well,</a>  we've almost got a space, but I'm with you 100%.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1554.819s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1555.28s">So</a>  we need to make sure that the feet are put to the fire and make sure that they find a location, but to also make sure that they comply with the law and to make sure that you actually can live a nice quality life in your neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1567.802s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1568.362s">So</a>  I'd like to know, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1570.562s">Who</a>  actually put limitations on the stop work order or the cease and desist order? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1576.924s">And</a>  I also want to find out when it was issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1579.584s">I</a>  know you came down and we actually counseled.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1581.905s">It</a>  was issued on a Thursday, two days after the meeting, which was the fifth on a Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1586.105s">I</a>  think it was issued on the seventh. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1587.786s">The</a>  seventh or the eighth.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1589.206s">If</a>  we can just get confirmation on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1592.307s">But</a>  I do agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1595.107s">Okay,</a>  then I do agree that an emergency meeting is warranted and we should be doing that.</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1600.189s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1601.69s">Council</a>  Member O'Connor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1603.451s">Through</a>  the Chair, when you say our code enforcement officer, he didn't make it to the site because the street was closed, is that what you're trying to say?</p>

    <p>[Francis Avola]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1611.538s">What</a>  happened was, is I was, exactly, I went down to see when he was going, because I read his, first of all, I didn't call the newspaper, the newspaper called me and I was reading some of his comments in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1625.767s">And</a>  one of his comments were, it's a noise issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1628.949s">It</a>  has a lot more to do with noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1630.59s">This</a>  is one of the problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1632.011s">But</a>  I've been there on five separate occasions and I haven't seen any of them working. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1636.233s">So</a>  I went down to get some documentation on what days he was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1641.376s">And</a>  I got like, whoa, I went down, I couldn't get a straight answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1644.92s">But</a>  I can tell you that for the last two weeks on Winchester Street, they've had it shut down except for Saturdays because they're doing all the gas lines there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1653.028s">So</a>  where did he go? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1654.309s">He</a>  couldn't get up Winchester Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1656.111s">If</a>  he went down Alfred Street next to my house, he would see a door wide open with guys there grinding away, you know?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1665.103s">Through</a>  the chair, I think we need to maybe take a vote to cease and desist the business, go on record, all hours of the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1675.905s">Just</a>  cease and desist. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1678.065s">We'll</a>  reiterate that we're asking our building department to issue another cease and desist for doing any work on the property, at the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1685.347s">I</a>  don't know what we're going to do on a Saturday morning down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1688.307s">I</a>  think it needs to start tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1689.827s">They</a>  need to be issued a cease and desist, bring them to the table sooner than that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1694.965s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1696.346s">Friend,</a>  if you can give your phone number to Larry. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1698.488s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1698.848s">And</a>  actually, if we can meet tomorrow at 8.30, I'll meet you at 8.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1701.17s">I'm</a>  on it like a hornet, I'll be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1702.791s">I'll</a>  meet you at 8.30 tomorrow morning at the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1705.973s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1707.014s">Thank</a>  you everybody, have a nice Christmas. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1708.435s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1712.558s">All</a>  right, motion to revert back to regular business?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1715.6s">So</a>  moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1716.621s">So</a>  moved.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1822.424s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1824.586s">We</a>  did ask for this resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1828.47s">Back</a>  a few months ago when we were discussing, I brought up the issue of dumping snow near Wright's Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1835.516s">We</a>  did get a grant to help alleviate some of that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1838.959s">There</a>  was a number of questions that were attached to that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1842.623s">One</a>  was, where have we stored snow as a city? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1846.226s">Where</a>  does the DPW store excess snow? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1849.969s">over</a>  the last three years and maybe amend it with regards to where we plan on storing snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1855.373s">Some</a>  people say we may have a bad winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1856.935s">I'd</a>  like to know where we're going to store excess snow this winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1861.798s">Also,</a>  we never got a response and I know the city solicitor was working on it with regards to the issue concerning Wrights Pond and the grant that was received. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1871.106s">So</a>  if I can amend this paper <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1872.777s">to</a>  also get a response on, so that's my second amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1877.44s">First</a>  would be where do we store snow? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1880.682s">Where</a>  do we plan on storing snow this year if we do have a bad winter? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1885.985s">And</a>  my second amendment would just be with regards to the issue of accepting a grant for Wright's Pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1894.155s">allow</a>  us to still limit Wrights Pond to Medford residents only. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1897.517s">We</a>  were waiting on an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1898.698s">I</a>  know the solicitor has been busy and did say he was going to try to wrap that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1903.261s">So</a>  I'd like to see if we could get an answer on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1905.783s">The</a>  City of Medford received a grant for work to be done on Wrights Pond and the question which a number of residents have is if we accept that grant, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1917.255s">can</a>  we still limit Rights Pond to Medford residents only? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1920.398s">We</a>  had to give back a grant in prior years before I was a Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1924.381s">We</a>  had to give back, I believe it was a state grant, because if we accepted that grant, we'd have to open up Rights Pond to non-residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1933.568s">So</a>  we gave back the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1934.829s">We</a>  had the city cover that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1937.11s">So</a>  now a few residents that were around at that point <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1943.475s">spoke</a>  to me with regards to this grant we just received to make sure we can still limit it because that was an issue over the last year or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1950.618s">Medford</a>  residents fought hard to make sure Rice Pond remained Medford residents only and everybody just wants to make sure that still remains the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1960.181s">So</a>  if we could move approval on this resolution as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1964.442s">see</a>  if we can get our questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1966.124s">This</a>  is the second or third time we've asked and I'd like to prepare accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1970.827s">Winter</a>  is coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1971.548s">We've</a>  already had snowfall and it would be nice to get the questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=1975.37s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2059.744s">Behind</a>  the Andrews Middle School where the soccer fields are.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2063.347s">Actually</a>  the soccer field itself.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2066.042s">Well,</a>  it was the issue with contamination next to the soccer field. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2070.425s">So</a>  then I requested that because it was so close to the Andrews, that's not a playground, but the Andrews soccer fields, that we do some test pourings at the Andrews soccer field as it abuts where the contamination was. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2086.517s">So</a>  I have not got an answer with regards to what the results of that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2091.82s">And</a>  I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2093.221s">Hundreds</a>  and hundreds of kids play soccer back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2095.767s">It's</a>  something this council voted in favor of. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2097.568s">I</a>  believe seven to nothing to do some test pourings there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2101.03s">I'd</a>  like to know what's going on.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2102.631s">I</a>  think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2103.412s">I</a>  think you have very common sense and great courage to ask that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2108.015s">I</a>  would like to find, ask if one, if you could amend this to add next door to that piece of land, which is bordering behind the Dr. Andrews School. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2123.848s">I</a>  believe that section of land is from the, behind the Doug E. Andrews School to the Riverside Yacht Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2134.504s">And</a>  I believe it has, as I say in the real estate business, a dirty 21E, which means contaminated soil with arsenic, possibly, and other chemicals. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2147.893s">And</a>  it's been cordoned off for over a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2152.797s">So</a>  I'm not sure what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2155.979s">I</a>  would like to know, because that's the area where they're supposed to finish the half-mile bike path. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2163.165s">from</a>  the Dogger Andrews to Route 93, behind the salt and stout. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2168.186s">It</a>  does not exist, and that's where I had my bicycle injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2171.787s">I</a>  had my concussion and broken hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2174.948s">So</a>  I would like to get this half mile of bike, flipper ship, bike path connector done. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2181.809s">It's</a>  only a half mile, it's not completed out of the 10 or 20 miles from West Method Island to all the way to the MBTA station at Assembly Road, mind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2194.466s">I</a>  would think it should have been done in the center of the square before to West Bedford Island and also towards McDonald Park and towards Assembly Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2204.776s">The</a>  center of the square does not have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2206.898s">This</a>  has a dirty 21D, I was told. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2210.841s">And</a>  it's just, it's bordering behind the Dr. Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2216.606s">So</a>  if you could ask, if you're gonna ask that question again, I would like for you to amend it and also ask about the bordering area where the kids play soccer.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2227.885s">through</a>  the chair, I will make that amendment that we get an update with regards to the contaminated area, which abuts the soccer fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2235.728s">That</a>  we did put money into already. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2237.409s">I</a>  know Alicia, I don't know if we've got an update recently on that, so if we could get an update to that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2244.392s">That</a>  was proven contamination that I know the city is on top of, although obviously it's moving slowly, but we did appropriate money to do the first stage that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2254.617s">Hunt</a>  wanted to do, and this came as a <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2258.408s">This</a>  came actually as a request or a condition in order for us to award that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2265.37s">So</a>  hopefully we can get an answer on both.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2267.51s">I</a>  hope you could pass the amendment also. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2270.031s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2271.151s">And</a>  if I may, if it's okay, I'd like to say Merry Christmas.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2311.481s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2313.343s">With</a>  the changing face of the old Meadow Glen Mall, I've gotten a number of phone calls from constituents concerned about having an inability to access Wegmans because of a lack of handicapped parking spots out in front of that facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2325.635s">They'd</a>  say down at Marshalls and down at Coles there's ample amount of parking, but over in the center of the plaza they're having a difficult time finding some spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2332.621s">So</a>  I'm asking the <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2334.923s">Office</a>  of Diversity Inclusion the new name of the diversity office to take a look at this Mr. President and see if they're in compliance with the city ordinance and if we can take any steps to work with Wegmans to put some more spots in closer. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2345.147s">That</a>  would be New England Developments. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2346.647s">New</a>  England Developments.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2349.188s">You</a>  want to change that to New England Developments?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2351.749s">Well</a>  I think that actually what I want them to do is take a look at actual Wegmans and spots accessing actual Wegmans.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2359.492s">So</a>  why don't we contact both of them?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2362.662s">All</a>  right, when the development is actually out there, they, well actually all I want right now is for the Office of Diversity to go out there and see whether or not they're in compliance with our ordinances and if they are, they are, if they aren't, they aren't, then we can take the next step.</p>

Hassett Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2425.626s">The</a>  address is 101, but you can see it's the building is boarded up, but in the lower half of the building towards the basement, there is the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2434.933s">So</a>  the boards have fallen off the building and the windows are broken and the whole bottom half of the building is exposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2441.697s">So</a>  anyone can get in there, kids, homeless people, I mean anyone has access to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2446.299s">So</a>  it's a bit of a safety concern that needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2449.321s">So</a>  if we could have the administration reach out to the landlord of that building to have that boarded up immediately, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2457.405s">And</a>  if I could further amend the paper to basically get some sort of an update from the landlord as to <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2465.149s">what</a>  they plan to do with the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2466.33s">I</a>  believe it's going to be a hotel, or at one point we were told it was going to be a hotel, but maybe get an update on the timetable.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2995.866s">Do</a>  we know if there are any other individuals in the community that have expressed some interest? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=2998.948s">I</a>  would not know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=3001.009s">If</a>  any other individuals...

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4073.318s">Thanks</a>  for having me Fergus, good to be here.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4074.778s">Good</a>  to have you back. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4075.679s">We'll</a>  start then of course in the US where the administration could be forgiven for thinking tonight one down, one to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4082.32s">The</a>  Republican majority in the House of Representatives successfully steered its tax reform bill through to a 227 to 203 vote victory. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4093.563s">Next</a>  comes the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4095.343s">There's</a>  been a bit of a kerfuffle as we heard in the news. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4098.044s">The</a>  Senate sent the bill back to the House to think it can get another vote tomorrow morning and then the Senate gets its <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4103.225s">go,</a>  probably before the end of Wednesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4105.848s">And</a>  if that goes according to plan, the first legislative win of Donald Trump's presidency will go to his desk for signature. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4113.376s">And</a>  we can expect that to be done with something more than his customary flourish. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4117.44s">Back</a>  to the House then. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4118.441s">What</a>  happened today? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4119.262s">A</a>  completely partisan outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4122.024s">Here's</a>  the Speaker, Paul Ryan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4123.835s">We</a>  said in 2016 that it would take real tax reform for families and businesses to get the American economy growing, and we were serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4132.639s">On</a>  January 1, Americans are going to wake up with a new tax code. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4136.581s">In</a>  February, they're going to see withholdings go down so they see bigger paychecks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4140.463s">And</a>  April 15 will be the last day they have to comply with the old, bad system. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4146.026s">This</a>  is a good day for America. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4147.847s">This</a>  is a good day for workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4149.507s">This</a>  is a great day for growth, and we're very excited about this moment.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4152.897s">Minority</a>  leader Nancy Pelosi, not so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4156.306s">She</a>  highlighted poll numbers, which have shown a steady decline in public support for the tax plan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4161.762s">Outside</a>  the Congress, the American people have already made their decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4166.966s">Polling</a>  shows that Americans oppose the GOP tax scam by a margin of two to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4172.95s">Hardworking</a>  families see right through the brazen con job Republicans are trying to sell them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4180.016s">So</a>  why aren't our Republican colleagues standing with their constituents? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4185.119s">Why</a>  aren't they joining us, insisting on a better deal for American families?</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4190.224s">away</a>  from the beltway, how is this highly charged issue playing out in the places where the real taxpayers live? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4196.768s">I've</a>  been talking to two Republican voters in Missouri. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4201.531s">Walt</a>  Cooper lives in Kansas City. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4203.453s">He's</a>  retired, but he used to work in the medical services technology sector. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4207.435s">Janet</a>  Matteliati is an attorney in St. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4209.897s">Louis.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_45]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4211.068s">I</a>  think it's hopefully going to be good for most of the people in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4216.691s">I</a>  think simplifying things will be particularly good. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4220.012s">I</a>  know some people say that this is only going to be good for the rich, but I think it will help people across the board and a lot of the middle class, of which I consider myself part of the middle class.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4231.341s">Opening</a>  thoughts from Walt Cooper then. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4233.622s">Just</a>  tell us how you see what's been going on in Washington and how well it reflects your concerns about the tax system as it's operated through your professional life.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4243.625s">I</a>  agree with Janet somewhat that I think it's going to be a positive thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4248.467s">I'm</a>  just recently retired and so I've been around a while and have watched taxes come and go, raise and lower, and I think giving people back as much money as you can and leaving it in the people's hands <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4261.491s">is</a>  the best way to go about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4263.232s">Government</a>  tends to waste our money at times, and they always want more. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4268.376s">And</a>  so I believe that if we do get some meaningful tax relief, I think it's going to be positive for our economy.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4275.1s">So</a>  when we heard Speaker Ryan say on Capitol Hill earlier on Tuesday, this is giving the money back to the people, you're all for that because you think the government doesn't spend it right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4286.967s">Well,</a>  I mean, I don't know of any government that spends it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4290.129s">And</a>  I think we have so many examples of government continuing to, I mean, they're one of the largest employers in the United States, and they've never cut back on anything ever, as far as I can remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4300.996s">And</a>  really, this is not, I mean, it's a tax cut, but it's a little bit of a misnomer in my mind, because they continue to talk about deficit that it'll create. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4311.462s">and</a>  continue conversations about paying for the tax cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4315.064s">So</a>  when you use the term paying for the tax cut, to me, that's code for, well, the government needs just as much money as they always did. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4322.389s">So</a>  what I would really like to see is not only a tax cut, but the government being forced to tighten their belt to say, we're going to give people back some of their money, and the government itself is going to run on less.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_45]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4336.097s">I</a>  agree with Walt that I think the <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4338.338s">government</a>  doesn't spend our money wisely in many cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4341.68s">I</a>  know certain things have to be taken care of, but just like any family here in America, when things are tight, you have to tighten your belt and rein things in. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4349.266s">And</a>  I agree with Walt that I don't think the federal government ever does that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4352.848s">We</a>  just seem to increase and increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4354.909s">So</a>  I would certainly like this followed up with spending cuts and things so that we can pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4360.573s">Now,</a>  one of my hopes is that in <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4363.354s">reducing</a>  the corporate rate that we can get more businesses back in the United States, since our rates were higher than most other countries, which will help the economy and will help pay for some of this, but I do think we need to do some spending cuts also.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4377.044s">Janet,</a>  I want to stay with you first and pick up a word you used I think is going to resonate with a lot of listeners in the U.S., and that is simplifying. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4385.972s">Thank</a>  the Lord I don't have to deal with the IRS, but I have American friends who do, and even the kind of briefing paper to help you do your taxes <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4395.22s">requires</a>  a doctorate, I think, to understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4398.061s">Tell</a>  us about the complexity of regular tax paying and how much harder it gets maybe when you're dealing with wills and all kinds of complicated legal procedures.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_45]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4408.726s">I</a>  mean, it's very complicated and I would have to laugh as an attorney who does estate tax planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4414.401s">I</a>  don't even do my own income tax returns, because there's all kinds of regulations for that, in addition to the stuff that I deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4422.086s">But</a>  I think they're on the right track as far as reducing a lot of the itemized deduction and increasing the standard deduction, because that's going to help a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4431.932s">I</a>  think a lot more people will do the standardized deductions as opposed to the itemized. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4436.075s">As</a>  it relates to my business, one part of the tax plan doubles the exemption from the state taxes and gift taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4444.682s">So</a>  by doing that, a lot of our clients will fall within that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4448.445s">So</a>  it's going to reduce what they have to do in some advanced planning, as far as the state tax would be concerned, and allows them to go back to do some more capital gains type planning with their estate plan, since they don't have to worry about the federal estate tax.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4463.817s">The</a>  word onerous just comes to my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4466.478s">I</a>  have a certified public accountant that's been doing my taxes for 30 years because I'm afraid to do them myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4472.44s">If</a>  you are in my stage of life where you're retiring and you're thinking about how you're going to live the rest of your life and live well as best you can on the money you have, one of the things that CPAs will tell you is, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4484.925s">you'd</a>  better be planning for taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4486.907s">But</a>  how does the average person do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4489.149s">There's</a>  entire industries in the United States to manage people's taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4494.475s">So,</a>  I mean, that's all you kind of need to know, is it's so complicated that there isn't anybody that knows it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4500.781s">I</a>  think simplification is a wonderful concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4504.325s">I</a>  hope that it is, in fact, real.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4506.907s">I</a>  know this is a huge document. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4508.789s">I</a>  wonder whether you can highlight, each of you, maybe three things that you think are immediately going to help America in terms of boosting jobs, boosting business, boosting collective incomes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_45]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4523.482s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4523.962s">I</a>  think I maybe kind of mentioned it before, but I think the reduction in the corporate tax will help to get some businesses back in the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4534.028s">One</a>  thing, and it really doesn't have to do with taxes, but I am in favor of the drilling in Alaska, and I think that will help our economy and help us become more oil independent. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4544.614s">And</a>  again, I'm just hoping that reducing the rates is going to get more money in average Americans' pockets, and then they will in turn be spending that.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4552.598s">That's</a>  three. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4553.318s">Walt,</a>  you're definitely allowed to agree.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4556.879s">Well,</a>  I think that Janet mentioned this earlier, but in terms of simplification, doubling the standard deduction for the average person, about 30 percent, I think, of American itemized deductions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4569.403s">So</a>  that means 70 percent don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4571.404s">So</a>  when you double that, that immediately puts money back in that middle class pocket. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4576.605s">And</a>  I think that if you go back to the days of Ronald Reagan and moving into the Clinton administration, we've seen what putting money back in people's pockets does for the economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4587.048s">So</a>  we might get a double whammy with that and the corporate tax rate that I agree that Janet talked about, because there's going to be a lot of repatriation of money coming back in the United States from corporations in here who have that money parked overseas. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4602.251s">I</a>  think our economy is going to be hot for a while.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4604.809s">hot</a>  for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4605.891s">Our</a>  thanks to Walt Cooper and Janet Matteliani. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4608.855s">They're</a>  both speaking to us from Missouri. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4611.078s">And</a>  let's go to Andy now in Austin, because you've been out and about talking to voters in rural parts of Texas. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4617.246s">Tell</a>  us a little bit about where you've been and the kind of people we're going to hear from.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4620.958s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4621.679s">I</a>  went outside of Austin, which is right in the center. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4624.601s">It's</a>  the capital of Texas, and I went about an hour west to a town. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4629.846s">It</a>  was actually Burnett and Llano counties, and I went to Horseshoe Bay, which is kind of a retirement community. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4638.113s">It's</a>  mostly sort of upper middle class folks, and they move out there from the hill country. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4643.318s">A</a>  lot of folks have land out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4645.62s">But,</a>  I really kind of just wanted to get a sense from them, I mean, the counties that I went to were 75% Trump voters, so I wanted to get a sense from them, sort of, what they were thinking about this tax bill, and just really honest, visceral reactions from, you know, not even necessarily the intricacies of the bill, because it's, like you said, 600 pages, and, you know, a lot of senators haven't read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4667.697s">I</a>  just wanted from these folks to get a real visceral reaction to what this tax bill meant to them.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4673.833s">My</a>  name is Leon Fuller. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4675.315s">I</a>  work at Horseshoe Bay Veterinarian Clinic. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4678.037s">He's</a>  got faith in the tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4679.899s">You</a>  know, I hope it does pass, and I hope we do get some money back to the middle class, which is all it's going to do is turn around and make our economy stronger.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4688.307s">Retired</a>  marketing and sales rep Frank Hosia is a little more cautious.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4692.711s">It's</a>  way too early. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4694.092s">Between</a>  the Senate and Congress, they're going to have so many different reiterations of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4699.454s">So</a>  anything we think about that we know, don't.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4702.795s">But</a>  he does think the tax system needs an overhaul. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4705.456s">He</a>  voted for Trump and thinks the bet on trickle-down is a good one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_41]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4708.658s">Having</a>  the highest corporate tax rate in the world makes no sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4713.539s">We're</a>  seeing the amount of jobs that are leaving the country and have been leaving the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4718.341s">Let's</a>  figure out how to bring the monies back to the country as well as the jobs back to the country.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4723.163s">Just</a>  a couple miles down the road in another little town, Marble Falls, I stop in at the R Bar.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4728.609s">I'm</a>  Nadine Rader. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4729.65s">I'm</a>  from Marble Falls and I'm a server at Noon Spoon Cafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4733.515s">I'm</a>  25.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4734.476s">She</a>  didn't vote in last year's presidential election.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4737.099s">I'm</a>  a single mom of two, so I'll get two child credits back at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4742.925s">And</a>  that's not going up for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4744.685s">But</a>  as far as somebody who, let's say, is making $150,000 in the home, they're going to get more money back than me, who is below $20,000 a year, just barely making it with two kids, single moms. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4756.728s">So</a>  I mean, yes, they are putting in more money into the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4760.709s">But</a>  no, it's not helping me.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4762.53s">Across</a>  the street is Bill's Burgers, where Roland Parker is grabbing a beer. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4766.251s">He's</a>  a self-employed cabinetmaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4768.191s">He</a>  also didn't vote in the presidential election.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4869.713s">It's</a>  certainly a big win, but certainly at the same time, Trump seems to be late to the party. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4875.617s">You</a>  know, the interest rate hikes have begun, increases have begun, inflation is low, employment is up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4881.822s">Therefore,</a>  what Trump is offering is not some kind of a fixing of the problem, but more like an icing on the cake. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4890.708s">He</a>  might like to tweet about it, but the problem doesn't need fixing anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4895.411s">But</a>  on the other hand, there are issues related to whether there is a demand in the economy to revive capital, because as of now, last night's report suggested some industries may not really gain, whereas some others will. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4909.567s">And</a>  looking at a higher perspective, the real threats to jobs haven't gone away yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4916.354s">You</a>  know, the middle class may get money back, but what about the Rust Belt? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4921.781s">You</a>  know, there are robots, robotics coming in, there is 3D printing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4926.466s">These</a>  are technological issues that can't be simply solved by a silver bullet like a tax plan.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4932.333s">I</a>  want to ask, can I just ask you a quick comparison question? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4935.715s">In</a>  fact, it comes in two parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4937.156s">One</a>  is about the bureaucracy and the complications of filing for the IRS, which we heard about from Janet a moment ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4944.501s">So</a>  let's do that bit first and tell me how that plays out in India. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4948.624s">Then</a>  I'll get on to the other thing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4950.225s">Well,</a>  India is much more bureaucratic. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4953.268s">In</a>  fact, India, the problem is opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4954.95s">India</a>  has a very low tax-to-GDP ratio, and the government has been trying to make its own India's biggest tax reform in the past several decades by introducing what's called the goods and services tax, a single one for the entire nation, which the Prime Minister called a good and simple tax, but small businesses do not find it good or <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4973.927s">simple</a>  because it increases the complexities of filing electronic returns 13 times a year, some reliefs have been given, it's been a toing and froing between the government and the opposition and some of the tax rates are as high as 28% and apart from that there is this whole cumbersome, you know, things like <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4992.745s">eBay</a>  bills and papers you have to maintain. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4995.247s">So</a>  nobody's liking the complexity or the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=4998.389s">And</a>  it was an election issue that the Prime Minister's BJP managed to somehow beat in this week's elections, last week's elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5006.754s">And</a>  to that extent, the government is safe, but it's quite shaken by some of these tax initiatives, which it says will benefit India in the long run. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5016.601s">But,</a>  you know, no one's really seen the long run.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5019.122s">OK,</a>  we'll come back to this in the second half of the programme. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5022.365s">Thanks</a>  both. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5023.085s">Andy,</a>  hold fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5024.226s">I</a>  know you've got a lot more to say about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5026.928s">I</a>  want to look into some other news now here on business matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5032.072s">We're</a>  going to go to Spain. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5033.112s">The</a>  northern region of Catalonia has seen a lot of campaigning in the last few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5038.296s">The</a>  election called by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy happens on Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5043.96s">Now,</a>  you'll remember we covered it on this programme. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5046.281s">Catalonia's</a>  attempt to break away from Spain in the wake of that disputed referendum unleashed a real political storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5053.143s">The</a>  former president of the regions is still in exile in Belgium. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5057.465s">A</a>  lot of his colleagues are in prison. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5059.986s">And</a>  the Spanish government has introduced direct rule across Catalonia. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5064.328s">Let's</a>  hear now from the BBC's Guy Hedgcoe in Barcelona.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5069.547s">I'm</a>  on the Ramblas, the boulevard in central Barcelona that's such a magnet for tourists. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5075.409s">Barcelona</a>  receives around 17 million tourists each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5079.69s">But</a>  in October, tourist arrivals fell by 5 percent, a dip which has been attributed to the political turmoil here during that month. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5088.492s">In</a>  addition, around 3,000 companies have moved their legal base out of Catalonia to other parts of Spain recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5096.134s">The</a>  firm Help My Cash, which compares financial services, is one of those that made the move. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5101.916s">Laurent</a>  Amar is its founder.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5104.437s">In</a>  September, we were in a very uncertain environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5107.418s">We</a>  were not able to clearly say what was going to happen, so we had to move the <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5113.48s">legal</a>  headquarter out of Catalonia. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5116.302s">We</a>  have one of our shareholders who lives in Madrid so it made sense to be there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5121.224s">Mr.</a>  Amar says the economic impact of the political instability was easy to gauge.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_07]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5127.348s">What</a>  we saw was a huge spike in traffic from people who were looking for where to put your money. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5133.731s">From</a>  one day to the other, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5135.452s">The</a>  number of users who were concerned about bank account exploded and the number of people who were looking for mortgages shrank because basically the whole mortgage business in Catalonia froze. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5148.328s">And</a>  so since October we've seen a drastic reduction in the number of people who come and look for mortgages in Catalonia.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5156.632s">Politically,</a>  Catalonia is much calmer now than it was just a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5161.473s">And</a>  certainly, it does look pretty much like business as usual, even though you can still see quite a few pro-independence flags hanging from balconies of apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5172.156s">But</a>  there are concerns that the effects for the economy could still be felt for some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5177.537s">I'm</a>  in the commercial district of central Barcelona, where Carlos Ribadulla, a businessman who has been very critical of the independence movement, has his offices.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5187.079s">Since</a>  September, October, November, we've been experiencing here in Catalonia a very dramatic economic turmoil. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5192.702s">For</a>  instance, we've seen consumption going down, where in the rest of Spain it's going up about 20% for restaurants, 25% for cinemas and shows, 25% for big department stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5206.129s">Are</a>  these elections going to solve the crisis, calm down the turmoil, do you think? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5211.512s">Sure,</a>  at least they might. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5212.994s">We</a>  have a choice, we have an option, I mean, an opportunity on December the 21st with the coming elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5219.54s">If</a>  we have a clear majority of pro-unity, pro-constitutional parties, yes, we'll have more stability, confidence and trust will be regained.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5233.153s">But</a>  polls suggest that pro-independence parties could win more seats than the unionists in the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5239.739s">This</a>  campaign advert featuring deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont speaking from exile in Belgium presents the vote as another referendum on the independence issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5251.13s">Ernest</a>  Maragall is a candidate for the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5256.392s">He</a>  says that if Madrid agreed to engage in negotiations about the territorial issue, the political and economic situation would improve dramatically.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5265.656s">If</a>  we had just normal dialogue at the table, the social and economic effects would disappear immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5272.419s">Imagine</a>  now, after the election of the 21st of December, the Spanish state would accept <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5279.102s">that</a>  the best way is a real dialogue with Catalonia. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5282.243s">Then</a>  it would have an immediate and spectacular effect in terms of calming all the instability.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5289.265s">But</a>  the Spanish government looks unlikely to engage in talks with Catalonia's pro-independence forces anytime soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5297.667s">Prime</a>  Minister Mariano Rajoy insists that he will continue to defend the unity of Spain against those who want to break away. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5308.983s">Although</a>  pro-independence parties might win the election, they could fall short of a majority, in which case it could be up to a coalition of left-leaning parties to decide who governs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5321.913s">The</a>  full results of the election will be known on the same day that the annual Christmas lottery is held in Spain, and with tickets on sale in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5331.721s">But</a>  this election, called by Mr. Rajoy, might be his biggest gamble yet.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5340.42s">Guy</a>  Hedgcoe reporting from Barcelona. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5343.041s">Of</a>  course, from Thursday on, we'll be bringing you results of that election in Catalonia here at the BBC World Service. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5350.105s">Much</a>  more to come on this edition of Business Matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5353.646s">Before</a>  the end of the hour, we're going to be talking about the ownership <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5357.068s">of</a>  the Carolina Panthers, why an NFL franchise is political, it's got race politics in it as well, there's the hashtag MeToo debate involved, it's stirring up a lot of contemporary American themes in one big package, and there is a lot of money at stake.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5636.229s">The</a>  Chinese system will be covering the power sector, which is, of course, the source of a lot of emissions, and will have an impact not only on the reduction of emissions, but also on the cost of energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5647.013s">What's</a>  critical about today's announcement is that it's a commitment to put this system into place, which puts on notice the rest of the world, especially existing carbon markets in the European Union and California, that there will be potential to link up with the Chinese market, and that's a very big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5663.499s">The</a>  potential for linkage establishes an international language. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5666.723s">If</a>  you think of a carbon ton, if you think of an emissions allowance as a new form of currency, as an international translation of environmental science from science to finance, that's really what's exciting about all this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5679.839s">I</a>  think the Chinese entry into this new world of commodities trading requires them to play by the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5686.403s">And</a>  so if they were to try to game such a system, which is under such an international microscope, it would be a very significant national embarrassment. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5694.268s">Now,</a>  that doesn't mean there won't be mistakes and there won't be probably some cheating. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5698.21s">But</a>  I think overall, it's a step into best practice at the financial services level.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_42]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5703.933s">And</a>  given how major an emitter of carbon China is, what sort of impact do you think this could have globally?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5712.115s">Well,</a>  I think it could have transformational impact in numerous ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5715.716s">First</a>  of all, the obvious, most important one is to actually reduce the emissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5719.437s">So</a>  if the Chinese power sector becomes comfortable with the rules and begins to understand it, they could get into it big time and they like to trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5727.299s">And</a>  so it could become quite significant that they're playing an internal competition game of who can reduce quickest. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5732.96s">And</a>  then secondly, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5734.3s">all</a>  companies that operate in China use power in one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5738.202s">So</a>  if the power sector is coming under control of the cap and trade, the users of power will feel the impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5744.424s">So</a>  it means that American companies, European companies, any company in China will feel the effects of this cap and trade indirectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5752.547s">And</a>  that can be good because you can never have too much efficiency when it comes to energy use. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5757.429s">So</a>  if the system works as it can, it could be very significant.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5761.907s">Thanks</a>  to Paula de Perna. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5764.088s">A</a>  transformational impact then. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5766.388s">Let</a>  me reintroduce from New Delhi this morning, Madhavan Narayanan of FirstPost.com, Andy Euler of Marketplace in Austin. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5773.491s">I</a>  don't suppose you want to step in here, Andy, with a crystal clear definition of what this involves, because, you know, people have been talking about this for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5781.013s">I</a>  remember going to Brazil, oh God, must be 10, 12 years ago, people talking about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5785.515s">It</a>  just hasn't caught on at the scale that the Green Movement hoped it would.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5789.916s">Well,</a>  and what stuck with me, too, was what Paula DiPerna said right at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5794.6s">She</a>  said, if this market works, which is really important, because there are three things that this carbon market needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5803.006s">It</a>  has to know how much carbon is being emitted and where it's coming from. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5808.61s">You</a>  need to have some sort of registry to figure out where it is coming from and who to hold accountable for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5817.215s">And</a>  then you also have to think about how much this carbon is going to cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5823.618s">You</a>  have to have sort of a market for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5825.979s">And</a>  none of these things right now exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5828.26s">I</a>  mean, the idea that China's going to come in and set up this carbon market is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5832.621s">I</a>  agree with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5834.182s">I</a>  think this is a great thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5835.402s">But</a>  at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5837.243s">This</a>  is going to have a long, long rollout process, because we're going to have to figure out all of the other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5842.926s">You</a>  can say, all right, this carpet market's open. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5844.927s">Now</a>  we've got to figure out how we're actually going to do it.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5847.349s">Do</a>  you buy the premise, Madhavan, of this conceptually?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5852.81s">Yes,</a>  I do, except that look at the challenges in trying to buy something out of someone for something that person didn't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5863.055s">That's</a>  what carbon emissions trading is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5865.416s">So</a>  it's like buying a vacuum sort of a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5867.937s">You</a>  know, I didn't do this, so pay me for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5869.818s">It's</a>  a bit of a ransom thing, if you ask me. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5872.039s">But</a>  there's also the irony that we're talking more of bitcoins than carbon trading, whereas carbon trading is actually producing social and ecological value.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5883.811s">Yeah,</a>  I was wondering whether carbon trading would ever become as sexy as bitcoin trading.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5888.495s">Yeah,</a>  there is a case to make it sexy, but as Andy said, you know, we need to have policing mechanisms to ensure that somebody is actually reducing emissions and therefore is worth paying for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5900.277s">India</a>  took baby steps around circa 2008 to list and authorize certain companies to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5907.758s">But,</a>  you know, the global economic crisis and the collapse of Lehman Brothers took our attention away from climate change towards Wall Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5916.5s">of</a>  the <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5932.032s">some</a>  incentives out of carbon trading on the one hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5934.434s">On</a>  the other hand, you have alternatives in form of everything from electric cars to solar energy to switch over. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5940.398s">This</a>  is a glorious dawn, if I may say so, for what I call green pricing or greenomics. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5948.824s">And</a>  I do hope the governments move faster on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5952.427s">My</a>  belief is that no government is moving fast enough on this.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5955.489s">And</a>  Andy, probably the good news about this with China's involvement, as we're hearing from Paul, it sets an example that the others can buy into and indeed tie into, but it also perhaps stops richer countries kind of effectively buying out their guilt by attributing it to somebody else, playing a market in a fairly cavalier way and buying themselves out of these kind of caps.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5979.59s">Well,</a>  and it's also this idea that China is now going to be, perhaps, the global leader in reducing carbon emissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5988.299s">I</a>  mean, the United States, it doesn't feel like that's a priority here. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=5992.463s">From</a>  everybody that you talk to, everybody that you're hearing politically, it doesn't feel like carbon emissions is one of the things that we talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6000.731s">I</a>  mean, we spent <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6002.112s">the</a>  whole first half of the show talking about tax reform. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6004.955s">We're</a>  not talking about global warming. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6006.696s">We're</a>  not talking about climate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6007.857s">We're</a>  not talking about carbon emissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6009.699s">And</a>  so if China's going to step in and be the global leader, I hope, from what it appears to me, that other rich countries are going to pay attention and say, you know what, if there's a market for this, of course, the American says, if there's a market for this, we're going to get in on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6025.553s">Because</a>  if there is that carbon market, of course America's going to get in on it.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6028.595s">Hold</a>  the thought about Bitcoin, by the way, folks, because we're coming back to that before the end of the half hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6033.88s">This</a>  is Business Matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6035.301s">We</a>  are live on the BBC. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6037.283s">Now,</a>  if you're running a startup in America and you're looking for investment, it helps if you're a man. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6043.268s">Between</a>  2011 and 2013, $51 billion of venture capital poured into U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6049.413s">companies,</a>  but only 3% of that went to companies led by a female CEO. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6055.298s">Findings</a>  published, by the way, in the journal Venture Capital. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6059.101s">If</a>  you're female and you're from an ethnic minority, well, then the prospects of raising money get even bleaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6065.085s">But</a>  now a group of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley is trying to do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6069.248s">The</a>  BBC's Riga Morris went along to the first meeting of so-called zebras in Portland, Oregon.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6076.065s">Zebras</a>  fix what unicorns break. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6079.086s">That's</a>  the motto of a movement in Silicon Valley's tech industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6083.048s">It</a>  may sound like marketing nonsense, but the movement is dead serious. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6087.89s">The</a>  zebras are frustrated by what they see as a lust for so-called unicorn companies.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6094.632s">Right</a>  now, unicorns is a popular <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6097.293s">title</a>  for companies that are valued at over a billion dollars, and Silicon Valley is chasing after these. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6102.838s">You</a>  know, there aren't a ton in existence, but they're enough to make people kind of gold rush hungry for finding the next unicorn company.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6110.005s">That's</a>  Jennifer Brandel. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6111.226s">She's</a>  one of the founders of the Zebra Movement, which aims to change the way tech startups are funded.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6117.992s">It's</a>  very hard to find investors who aren't thinking about striking it rich, especially because now with technology, companies can scale very quickly sometimes, sometimes too quickly for their own good. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6128.92s">And</a>  so zebras are an alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6130.481s">Instead</a>  of a unicorn, which is mythical and rarely seen, zebras are actually real and they get their competitive advantage from cooperating. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6138.306s">Unicorns,</a>  I think, are dangerous in that they grow up so quickly and before they've had a chance to really understand the power that they wield and how to do it responsibly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6150.174s">I</a>  went to the zebras first ever gathering, DazzleCon. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6158.317s">It's</a>  called DazzleCon because a group of zebras is known as a dazzle. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6163.579s">It's</a>  true. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6164.0s">I</a>  looked it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6166.098s">But</a>  this isn't your standard Silicon Valley tech conference. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6169.34s">First</a>  of all, the guests are predominantly women. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6172.463s">And</a>  secondly, the chat isn't the standard Silicon Valley grow fast or die trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6178.848s">At</a>  DazzleCon, they're talking about social impact, sustainability, and about how women receive less than 10% of all venture capital funding in Silicon Valley.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_32]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6187.714s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6189.315s">Ania</a>  Williams joined the Zebra movement as a co-founder after struggling to raise money for her wearable tech company, Tinsel.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6195.74s">I</a>  pitched over 100 investors and at the end of the day I ended up landing two. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6201.706s">And</a>  I realized that there were a lot of issues with the way that the VC model works. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6206.731s">I</a>  think that the model is very broken. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6208.353s">I</a>  think that obviously it favors a specific type of person over everyone else. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6214.82s">Do</a>  you mean white male? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6216.862s">Well,</a>  you know, you said it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6220.104s">One</a>  of the zebras is Tara Reid. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6221.865s">She's</a>  the founder of Apps Without Code. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6224.526s">She</a>  says the zebra movement is important, but that it could only exist in the tech industry.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6230.068s">This</a>  distinction between zebras and unicorns, this is only a tech conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6234.37s">If</a>  you have conversations with any other industry, right, what you want to be is a zebra. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6238.891s">That's</a>  normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6239.532s">That's</a>  how businesses work. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6241.112s">For</a>  some reason in tech, we have this different idea of how business works, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6245.874s">Well,</a>  it's because we have these fairy tales of boys in their dorm rooms becoming billionaires.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6250.177s">Right,</a>  but I think if you hear the fairy tales in other industries, like the fairy tale is Pepsi or Coca-Cola, the fairy tale is some other business that generates profit and distributes that profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6261.926s">Those</a>  are the different fairy tales. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6263.467s">So</a>  I think outside of Silicon Valley, this is, of course, it's normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6267.751s">So</a>  I think the zebra movement will mainly exist in Silicon Valley because that's what the rest of the world is doing.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6274.25s">That's</a>  the BBC's Riga Morris meeting members of the Zebra Gathering. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6278.714s">It</a>  happened in Portland, Oregon. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6281.457s">DazzleCon</a>  2017 was the title. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6285.22s">What's</a>  the collective noun for unicorns? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6287.882s">At</a>  Fergus Nicol, if you know the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6290.645s">Madhavan,</a>  would this work in India? <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6292.687s">Do</a>  you buy that concept?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6294.564s">Well,</a>  I just heard an interesting story last week about a venture capital meeting that took place in Delhi in which an investor bluntly told a woman that he will not invest in a company founded by a lady who would take six months off for maternity. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6311.18s">So</a>  basically we are looking at asking <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6314.843s">bungee</a>  jumpers to help a blind woman cross the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6317.705s">I</a>  mean, to draw an analogy between, you know, this is about greed and scale and value and as, you know, it could be a very white male thing, but this is about capitalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6326.829s">So</a>  zebra is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6328.25s">First</a>  of all, it creates a wonderful zebra versus unicorn debate to raise awareness on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6334.693s">But</a>  I have a feeling that the answers do not lie in conventional venture capital, but probably in three other things that are already there. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6342.841s">One</a>  is boutique investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6345.384s">The</a>  other is impact investment, which is an offshoot of venture capital that looks at social goals rather than economic scaling. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6352.811s">And</a>  the third would be philanthropy. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6355.233s">You</a>  know, there's a lot of money going on in philanthropy and some of those funds could be put into helping minorities and women and entrepreneurs of a different kind so that they can co-exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6365.281s">You</a>  know, one of the Silicon Valley's favorite word is ecosystem. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6368.904s">Maybe</a>  there isn't category for an ecosystem, but having said that, let me joke that in this whole zebra thing, everything is not in black and white, there are grey areas, and the zebras will have to earn their stripes.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6383.093s">Okay,</a>  pile them in, pile them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6385.954s">That's</a>  very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6386.955s">I</a>  like the point about social entrepreneurship. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6389.236s">That's</a>  something we can do in more detail, I think, on this program in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6392.218s">That's</a>  a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6393.659s">to</a>  make a marker. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6395.321s">Andy,</a>  we heard there from the women talking to Reagan in Silicon Valley itself and that thing going on in Portland, that this is something they're focused on their area. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6407.136s">Can</a>  it translate across America?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6409.218s">I</a>  don't know because it still feels like, I mean, you talk to, we have a technology reporter, a tech reporter, Molly Wood, who talks about, she spends a lot, I mean, she lives in San Francisco and spends a lot of time in Silicon Valley and talks about sort of the ecosystem, like we were talking about, being basically a lot like the priesthood, a lot, very male and a lot of white males. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6432.462s">And</a>  so when you get into these meetings, so many female entrepreneurs are getting into these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6439.643s">They're</a>  not being listened to or they're just being told no.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6445.085s">Is</a>  that Silicon Valley or is that the VC sector?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_40]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6449.727s">It</a>  feels like it is sort of the VC sector and it feels like so much of that money <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6455.149s">is</a>  with a certain set of people who invest in other people that look like them. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6461.114s">I</a>  mean, you know, it's sort of the idea of shuffling that money around. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6465.858s">It</a>  doesn't feel like Silicon Valley is much different from other places in the United States where there's a ton of money and there's a ton of really powerful people that are shuffling that money around.</p>

    <p>[mgC3PACaQmc_SPEAKER_50]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6476.928s">OK,</a>  we talked earlier in the program, guys, about Bitcoin, and we're going to talk in more detail now, because Asia has been at the forefront of the cryptocurrency craze. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6485.571s">Investors</a>  in Japan, China, South Korea driving up the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum and the others compared to traditional investments, let alone good old cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6496.356s">Cryptocurrencies</a>  are still pretty niche. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6500.058s">But</a>  the hype seems to have a lot more Asians interested in this market. <a href="https://youtu.be/DZsOi_61ST8&t=6506.028s">Now,</a>  we've been trying to make connection with our Asia business correspondent, Karishma Vaswani, joining us, we hope, this morning from Singapore.</p>
