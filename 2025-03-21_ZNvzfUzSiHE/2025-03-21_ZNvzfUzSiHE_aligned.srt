Motion to suspend the rules.

22
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:47,164
Motion to suspend the rules by Councilor Knight.

23
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:48,024

00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:49,384
All those opposed?

25
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:50,605
Motion passes.

26
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:54,287
Counselor Knight, for what reason do you ask for the suspension of the rules?

27
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:58,050
To take paper 16-056 out of order, Mr. President.

28
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:10,358
On the motion to take paper 16-056 out of order, petition for signed denial reversal by Antonio Pereira of Tasty Cafe on the Hill, 321 Boston Avenue, Memphis, Mass.,

29
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:19,042
OCD application 2016-1 cannot exceed two square feet per linear foot of frontage.

30
00:01:19,362 --> 00:01:28,030
We received a communique in our packets over the weekend with a detailed description and delineation of the problem.

31
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:29,151
Councilor Knight.

32
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:33,394
The petition is present.

33
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,456
Please present yourself to the record.

34
00:01:46,964 --> 00:01:58,813
Mr. President, it's a non-conforming sign.

35
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:00,735
I've reviewed the documentation that they've attached.

36
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:03,217
I think it'll be a beautiful addition to the neighborhood and I'd move for approval.

37
00:02:04,498 --> 00:02:12,524
On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, Chair recognizes, seconded by Councilor Caviello, Chair recognizes Vice President Longo Kern.

38
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:13,968
Thank you, President De La Russo.

39
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,969
I agree, I think it's classy.

40
00:02:17,789 --> 00:02:19,290
If I could ask you a question, if you don't mind.

41
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,132
Is the rest of the stores that are beside you, are they going to go to awnings as well?

42
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:24,933
I hope so.

43
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:26,393
Yeah, they will look very nice.

44
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:28,774
I'll make sure that the landlord finances it for them.

45
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:30,875
Well, good for you.

46
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:32,016
It'll look really nice.

47
00:02:32,076 --> 00:02:34,677
It'll stand out, and that's the point, is to make it stand out.

48
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:35,337
Yeah, it's great.

49
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:37,779
You want to spend the money on an awning like that, and it's going to look very nice.

50
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:38,299
Thank you.

51
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:39,392
Good Tony.

52
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:39,893
Good luck.

53
00:02:40,053 --> 00:02:40,654
Thank you.

54
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:51,224
So on the motion for approval by a council night, a seconded by a counselor Caviello, all those in favor, all those opposed motion care.

55
00:02:51,604 --> 00:02:51,925
Thank you.

56
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:52,445
Good luck.

57
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:52,866
Thank you.

58
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,526
While we're on the suspension, Councilor Marks.

59
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:03,508
We have members from the Method Arts Council here tonight.

60
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:05,269
Can we take two papers?

61
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:14,114
16-054 offered by myself and also 16-055 offered by Councilor Felco.

62
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:16,015
I would be delighted.

63
00:03:16,035 --> 00:03:17,196
16-054 offered by Councilor Marks.

64
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:34,423
be resolved that the Medford Arts Council be recognized for being named the 2016 Council of the Year Award from the Massachusetts Cultural Council for its dedication to community arts and culture in the city of Medford, Mr. Councilor.

65
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:37,464
And also Councilor Falco's too.

66
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:40,146
We'll do one at a time, are they both the same?

67
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:41,547
Same paper, Mr. President.

68
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:47,690
Then we'll take them together, 1516-055, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Medford City Council

69
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:55,809
commend and congratulate the Medford Arts Council for being selected as the 2016 Council of the Year by the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

70
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,750
Councilor Marks?

71
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:03,934
Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Felkel for also offering his resolution of the same subject.

72
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:16,322
You know, Medford's on the move, Mr. President, and we have many great volunteers to thank, and we're getting a lot of good press in this community when it comes to the arts.

73
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:34,676
Of most recent, Mr. President, as you just mentioned, the Massachusetts Cultural Council announced a few days ago that the Method Arts Council is the recipient of the 2016 Council of the Year Award for its dedication to community arts and culture over the past year.

74
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:42,798
You know, this is a recognition, Mr. President, that is comprised of 329 local cultural councils.

75
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:47,446
This is not one of five, one of 10.

76
00:04:47,546 --> 00:04:58,051
This is 329 statewide cultural councils, and our great council volunteers received the number one recognition, Mr. President.

77
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:12,857
And here we have a group, Mr. President, until just recently, the last two to three years, had zero funding from the city.

78
00:05:12,977 --> 00:05:14,238
There was no direct

79
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:36,966
funding mechanism to support the arts in this community from the administration until I believe it was three years now, two to three years, that there was a resolution offered by this council requesting that the administration look into creating a line item for the arts in our community, which funds thousands of projects a year in the community.

80
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:45,731
involves people from three years old to 83 years old of the community, and it really touches every aspect of our community.

81
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:53,994
And without the Method Arts Council and these dedicated people to organize, a lot of this would never happen, Mr. President.

82
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:58,855
And I just personally would like to thank all the members of the Method Arts Council.

83
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:06,018
I'd like to also recognize them here tonight through a citation, Mr. President, a future citation.

84
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:08,246
Many members are here tonight.

85
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:15,349
So I'd just like to recognize, Mr. President, the chair of the Meffitt Arts Council, Gary Roberts, is here with us tonight.

86
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,192
Laurel Siegel is the treasurer of the Meffitt Arts Council.

87
00:06:26,093 --> 00:06:28,855
Anita Tucker is the secretary of the Meffitt Arts Council.

88
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:36,198
Bettina Lentzfeld is the grant coordinator of the Meffitt Arts Council.

89
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,903
Patricia Davis is a member.

90
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:43,183
Jenny Gilbert.

91
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:45,464
Jenny Gilbert.

92
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:46,665
Linda Malik.

93
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:54,248
And Allie Fisk is also a member of the Methodist Council.

94
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:07,893
And, you know, I had the opportunity, I think it was probably eight months ago or maybe a little longer, to sit down with the

95
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:12,075
chair of the Arts Council, Mr. President, Mr. Roberts.

96
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:33,629
And he presented to me a portfolio of accomplishments over the years, also a projection of what they'd like to see done over the next several years regarding how we can improve arts in the community and involve more community outreach to different aspects and segments of the community.

97
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:37,900
And, you know, I found it quite enlightening.

98
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:41,443
One of the things that — and I bring it up quite often.

99
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:44,586
I brought it up during the debates, when we had our council debates.

100
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:49,030
Gary mentioned to me about things that are done in other communities.

101
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,032
And he pointed out — he had a PowerPoint presentation.

102
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,914
He was well prepared, which was great.

103
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:57,997
And he pointed out what they do in Lowell, Mr. President.

104
00:07:58,658 --> 00:08:02,421
And I don't like to compare ourselves to other surrounding communities, but I think it's important to look

105
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:25,370
when the success in other communities and try to capture that success in a way that represents our city in a way that works for our city and There was one particular thing that stood out to me and it was the performing arts and how they utilize pox and lowell that would downtrodden crime-ridden and fill with drugs and

106
00:08:26,077 --> 00:08:32,139
And they opened them up to the arts community, built small performance stages at very minimal cost.

107
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:38,740
They encompassed their park with wrought iron art and signage.

108
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,561
And they made it so welcoming that people wanted all of a sudden to say, you know what?

109
00:08:42,961 --> 00:08:44,382
This is no longer a drug park.

110
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:46,842
This is no longer a park I'm afraid to take my kids.

111
00:08:47,242 --> 00:08:48,383
It's a welcoming park.

112
00:08:48,923 --> 00:08:53,104
And the performance stage, you know, it was very modest.

113
00:08:53,605 --> 00:09:04,450
But it was enough to attract people back, make these community parks, which we are very fortunate in our community to have so many community parks, as once again part of the community.

114
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:16,135
And I would submit to my fellow colleagues that, you know, years ago we used to have the park leagues and there used to be a lot of activity in the parks, as Councilor Scott Pelley could probably attest to.

115
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:23,418
And over the years, our parks have really grown to just a large open space that's, in my opinion, underutilized.

116
00:09:24,218 --> 00:09:37,549
And I think we have a real gem here with, at least with the Method Arts Council and their vision to utilize this open space, attract people in the neighborhoods so you can meet the people.

117
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,753
Nowadays, you only know the people that live across the street or next door to you.

118
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:47,465
Wouldn't it be nice to go to a local park that's right down the street and meet neighbors in your neighborhood?

119
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:49,986
It's just a great concept.

120
00:09:50,627 --> 00:10:01,694
And I know these are the small things that the Method Arts Council is working towards under the leadership of Mr. Roberts and the whole group that's been active for years.

121
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:10,981
And I just want to personally thank them, Mr. President, for putting Method once again on the map and letting people know that

122
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:13,660
This community is an art community.

123
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,221
We are a cultural community.

124
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:17,703
We have a lot of assets in this community.

125
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,385
And this is just the tip of the iceberg.

126
00:10:20,806 --> 00:10:34,817
I see a bright, bright future based on the volunteers that we have here tonight and the other hundreds of volunteers throughout the community that are part of the Method Arts Council and all the different groups that are comprised of MACI and so forth.

127
00:10:34,857 --> 00:10:40,442
So, again, Mr. President, I'd like to thank the members of the Method Arts Council.

128
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:45,929
and, uh, that they be duly recognized, uh, by an official citation of the Memphis city council.

129
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:59,681
So on the motion of council marks that they be recognized by citation, uh, the chair, uh, recognizes council Falco who also, uh, presented to us a motion of a similar nature.

130
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:00,461
Council Falco.

131
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:01,522
Thank you, Mr. President.

132
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:01,902
Thank you.

133
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:03,003
Uh, council of marks.

134
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:08,508
Uh, I, again, uh, thank you for you bringing the citation forward and, uh, for, uh,

135
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,643
recognizing the Medford Arts Council.

136
00:11:10,723 --> 00:11:12,905
Congratulations to the Medford Arts Council.

137
00:11:13,065 --> 00:11:13,905
Fabulous job.

138
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:15,666
This is pretty amazing.

139
00:11:15,907 --> 00:11:21,070
When you think about it, you are only the third council to ever receive this award, which is pretty amazing.

140
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:24,512
This is just a great group of people.

141
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:33,378
Myself and I believe Councilor Marks and Councilor Caviello last fall had the opportunity to attend the Arts and Culture Summit that you had in this very room.

142
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:35,600
And it was just a great day.

143
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:44,875
to see that many, I think there must have been about 100 people, over 30, 35 organizations that were here talking about arts and culture and the importance of arts and culture in our community.

144
00:11:45,596 --> 00:11:48,737
And it's just, this is a great achievement.

145
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:54,419
I know there's a lot of great things, you know, that you're working on and there's a bright future.

146
00:11:54,459 --> 00:12:00,322
And I think, you know, also the really important thing is that, you know, that we make sure that this is funded in the budget.

147
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:01,342
It's important.

148
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:02,703
We need to stand by you.

149
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:05,944
And I know I will, and I'm sure my colleagues will as well.

150
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:07,569
in the administration as well.

151
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:10,810
But I just want to say congratulations, great job, keep up the great work.

152
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,010
Thank you.

153
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,390
Thank you.

154
00:12:15,991 --> 00:12:17,151
Well, on the motion of approval.

155
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,612
Just a quick question.

156
00:12:18,632 --> 00:12:19,592
Oh, please, by all means.

157
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:22,872
Because I'm glad Councilor Falco brought up the funding.

158
00:12:23,613 --> 00:12:29,774
And I received several emails from members of local artists in the community.

159
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:34,955
And with the change in leadership in the community, they were asking whether or not

160
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:42,852
The commitment that was there under Mayor McGlynn for the budget line item would still be present in this year's budget in July.

161
00:12:43,573 --> 00:13:02,739
And I think as a council, we should send, along with this paper, a message asking the administration if they would continue, because the budget's created by the mayor, continue the funding of a line item for the Medford Arts Council, and taking it one step further because

162
00:13:03,203 --> 00:13:08,326
The commitment that we made as a council back some years ago was, you know, we're going to give you an amount of money.

163
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,268
I think it was 10 or 12,000 at the time.

164
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:20,575
And, uh, knowing that was just a small amount in a city of this size, but then to revisit it in a year from now saying, what were you able to accomplish?

165
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:22,216
Is this money being well spent?

166
00:13:22,656 --> 00:13:27,059
And I think everyone behind this reeling, uh, and I won't speak for them feel that

167
00:13:27,702 --> 00:13:34,184
We got our best bang for our buck for that $10,000 or $12,000 in the amount of programming that took place in this community.

168
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:45,848
So I would ask, Mr. President, along with asking the mayor once again for the commitment to the line item in the budget, that we also ask that it be increased, Mr. President.

169
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:57,052
And it seems to be that the $15,000 range from 15 to 30, maybe to 45, would be the next natural progression in this funding.

170
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:12,449
And I can just speak for myself that I know every penny of that goes towards improving and also reaching out to people in the community to make them aware that the arts are alive in wellness communities.

171
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:20,916
So if I can make that part of the paper, Mr. President, that in addition to the council citations to the Method Arts Council,

172
00:14:21,523 --> 00:14:28,527
We ask that the mayor continue the line item in the budget, and also to increase the budget this year.

173
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:32,590
We can put in an amount or not.

174
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,971
Sometimes it's a double edged sword.

175
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,033
Maybe the mayor wants to fund it to 100,000.

176
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:47,839
So it'd be up to the council, but I think we should just ask for increased funding, Mr. President, in the line item for the city budget, this year's budget.

177
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:52,778
So, those two motions, Mr. President.

178
00:14:53,258 --> 00:14:54,539
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

179
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,259
Thank you, Mr. President.

180
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:57,359
Again, I want to commend this group.

181
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:03,080
I remember when this group first started from a small organization to an award-winning group now.

182
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,001
I agree 100% with Councilor Mox.

183
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:15,082
I was proud to be part of the group that awarded funding for you in the past, and I feel that more funding should be made available to you.

184
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:19,063
And I think the Mayor has the same commitment because she has

185
00:15:19,797 --> 00:15:30,804
I think they've already started a transition team as an art and culture team, and I commend you for doing that and taking more input from the community to see how we can grow the arts.

186
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:41,031
I also think it's incumbent of us to help you find a home again, seeing that the mall is closed and you're displaced again.

187
00:15:41,051 --> 00:15:47,715
So I would hope that part of the transition team will be suggestions

188
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:51,229
on finding a home for the Methodists in this community.

189
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,510
Again, I thank you and I congratulate you on your award.

190
00:15:56,451 --> 00:15:57,231
Thank you, Councilor.

191
00:15:57,271 --> 00:16:04,854
So on the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended, a roll call, Mr. Clerk, has been requested on this matter.

192
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:08,950
Mr. President, we may have someone from the United Finance Council who'd like to speak.

193
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,131
Oh, we'd be delighted to.

194
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:13,792
Before we call the roll, we invite the President to address us.

195
00:16:13,812 --> 00:16:15,713
The President never passes up an opportunity.

196
00:16:15,773 --> 00:16:16,253
That's right.

197
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:16,893
Thank you.

198
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:29,698
First of all, thank you for recognizing us today, especially Councilor Falco and Councilor Marks, and for your attendance to Councilor Caviello at the summit in this very chamber on November 14th.

199
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:37,986
That was an incredible experience for the community, envisioning a moment for what could happen in the future.

200
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:45,333
We had four themes that day, partnerships, participation,

201
00:16:46,257 --> 00:17:01,605
Publicity and public art and when you start thinking long-term planning with these new resources that the city's providing having a vision for what can happen when all these isolated efforts are linked together and

202
00:17:02,005 --> 00:17:03,306
It's truly astonishing.

203
00:17:03,346 --> 00:17:08,908
I think it's only going to get better for the arts and culture in this community.

204
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:18,312
I think not a week goes by that I don't encounter yet another exciting effort that's happening in one of our middle schools, in our high school.

205
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:22,936
in an artist organization, in a writer's group, a performing group.

206
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:31,284
Just learned today that a Medford musician, Shannon Heaton, was awarded a fellowship from the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

207
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:38,451
So, you know, it's almost on a daily basis where recognition is happening for what's going on in the city.

208
00:17:39,532 --> 00:17:42,055
With the funds that you provided us last year,

209
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:47,799
We were able to increase our granting budget for this calendar year of 2016 by $15,000.

210
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:59,368
So we awarded $45,300 to 62 grants, 62 projects and field trips, which serve hundreds and thousands of members of this community.

211
00:18:00,489 --> 00:18:02,770
So we're very excited about the future.

212
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:08,795
We do believe that your money is being well spent and plan to continue doing that.

213
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,678
2016 is going to be an even better year for us, I hope.

214
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:12,138
Thanks.

215
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:14,219
Thank you, Mr. President.

216
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:18,921
Thank you.

217
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:23,803
Vice President.

218
00:18:23,883 --> 00:18:24,243
Thank you.

219
00:18:24,263 --> 00:18:25,324
Um, President Dillard.

220
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:33,067
So I, I think Council Marks and Council Falco said it all, but I just would be remiss if I didn't say, you know, how thankful I am as a counselor.

221
00:18:33,327 --> 00:18:35,048
Um, I saw a, uh,

222
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:42,391
I saw the arts in Medford grow with Maria Daniels, and now it's even picking up more so with Mr. Roberts.

223
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:45,212
So I just want to tell you to keep doing what you're doing.

224
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:48,432
The interest is growing tenfold.

225
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:56,934
And like you said, the amount of people that are affected by a small amount of money and what you're able to do for the community, I just think it's great work.

226
00:18:57,454 --> 00:18:58,594
And keep up the good work.

227
00:18:58,854 --> 00:18:59,114
Thank you.

228
00:19:06,956 --> 00:19:08,717
On the motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

229
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:11,238
Councilor Caviello?

230
00:19:11,478 --> 00:19:11,678
Yes.

231
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:13,118
Councilor Falco?

232
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:13,458
Yes.

233
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:14,639
Councilor Knight?

234
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:14,959
Yes.

235
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:16,679
Vice President Long-Term?

236
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:16,920
Yes.

237
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,000
Councilor Marks?

238
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:18,540
Yes.

239
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,680
Councilor Scarpelli?

240
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:19,780
Yes.

241
00:19:20,841 --> 00:19:21,741
President DelaRusso?

242
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:22,181
Yes.

243
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,222
With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion carries.

244
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:29,104
On the motion of Councilor Knight to resort back to the regular order of business.

245
00:19:29,564 --> 00:19:30,364
All those in favor?

246
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:32,525
All those opposed?

247
00:19:33,637 --> 00:20:01,819
16-049 offered by Councilor Marks, whereas delivery trucks are still parking on city sidewalks at the corner of Harvard and Main Street, causing a public safety concern, and whereas after a neighborhood public safety walk conducted with the area residents and Chief Sacco took place resulting in the request to relocate the bus stop located at the corner of Harvard and Main Street, then be it resolved that the Metro City Council call for an onsite committee of the whole meeting to relocate the bus stop and request the Traffic Commission

248
00:20:02,223 --> 00:20:06,045
to create a loading zone to assist area businesses with deliveries.

249
00:20:06,085 --> 00:20:06,765
Councilor Marks.

250
00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:08,946
Thank you, Mr. President.

251
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:21,932
And I want to thank you, too, Mr. President, for meeting with area residents of the Salt Method area over the weekend to try to resolve this very important, what I consider a public safety concern in the area.

252
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:31,456
I think anyone that's tuned into the council meeting has heard over the last at least six months, a year, that there's been a concern with

253
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:39,705
uh, the parking of trucks at the corner of Harvard in Maine in particular, and also yield in Maine.

254
00:20:40,366 --> 00:20:45,689
Um, and, uh, it's been a real concern, uh, of residents for a number of years.

255
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:58,378
And after a safety walk through, uh, it was recommended by the chief and by a number of area residents, uh, that took the walk that, uh, ball would be placed on both corners.

256
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:09,109
And I think they've done some help in alleviating some of the concern with cars and trucks parking on the corner and on the sidewalk.

257
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:28,856
However, in particular, in Harvard, in Maine, there still is a concern with large trucks, 18-wheelers pulling up, parking down Harvard Street, right on the sidewalk, where it poses a real public safety concern for pedestrians in the neighborhood.

258
00:21:29,462 --> 00:21:37,984
So I would ask, Mr. President, and I know we've had a lot on our plate, but I think it's about time that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting on this issue.

259
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:46,686
This council has taken several unanimous votes to requesting a Committee of the Whole meeting, but to date we have not had any.

260
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:57,089
And I would ask that it be on site, because the major issue is relocating the bus stop, which is in front of the Oasis Restaurant,

261
00:21:57,657 --> 00:22:02,720
possibly down another 20 yards down Main Street, Mr. President.

262
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,922
And that is not just because we want to relocate a bus stop.

263
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:13,247
It's to create a delivery spot, which currently does not exist in that business district.

264
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:14,948
You can go to Meffitt Square.

265
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:16,089
There's delivery spots.

266
00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:19,391
You can go up the hillside, which is a very congested area.

267
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:20,632
There's delivery spots.

268
00:22:21,012 --> 00:22:25,655
Almost every business district has delivery spots for area business.

269
00:22:26,102 --> 00:22:28,223
However, none exist in this particular area.

270
00:22:28,943 --> 00:22:36,265
And what we're seeing is that these trucks are being very careless in where they park their rigs.

271
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:40,327
They're only concerned about one thing, and that's to get the product to the business.

272
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:42,487
And that's what they should be concerned about.

273
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:50,370
But we as a city, Mr. President, and as elected officials, have to be concerned about the public safety in our community.

274
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,711
So I know there's a couple of residents that would like to speak.

275
00:22:54,503 --> 00:23:03,131
But I would ask, Mr. President, forthwith, and I think you appreciate the situation here and realize that something needs to be done.

276
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:19,927
And that Committee of the Whole on-site, Committee of the Whole meeting be addressed with Chief Sacco, with the MBTA, and whoever else wants to attend to address this issue, Mr. President.

277
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:21,156
Thank you, Councillor.

278
00:23:21,476 --> 00:23:22,837
We'll take that under advisement.

279
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:33,705
As you know, the matter is still in subcommittee on transportation and with the new chairman, we're going to urge him to have a swift meeting to report that out.

280
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:49,716
I can also report to you that the mayor has met with the police chief on the matter this past week and is urging resolution A on the, has directed resolution on A, the parking on the sidewalk.

281
00:23:50,301 --> 00:24:03,712
and to make measures of enforcement, uh, and stricter supervision there and B, uh, to, uh, begin dialogue with the MBTA to examine, uh, options for the bus stop, uh, moving.

282
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:07,255
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

283
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:08,196
Thank you, Mr. President.

284
00:24:08,737 --> 00:24:16,203
Uh, I, I, along with Councilor Marx, you know, we were there for some of the, I was there with him for some of the walkarounds and, uh, I've gone to, um, many traffic committee hearings.

285
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:33,456
In regards to these matters, and the city did put some bollards in, but I think on the Harvest Street side, the only way to alleviate this would be to put bollards halfway up the street to stop the parking on that end.

286
00:24:33,476 --> 00:24:40,942
I mean, I drive by there, I see this rocks on the sidewalks, and there was some grassy area, now it's just a mud area.

287
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:47,144
Again, it's unsightly for the neighbors, and I feel for them, because I'm down there a lot, I see it.

288
00:24:47,764 --> 00:24:51,466
And I'm glad that the mayor is getting involved with this.

289
00:24:51,546 --> 00:25:07,897
And hopefully, as a group, in the next couple of weeks, and the MBTA, the whole city can come up with some type of solution to end this for the neighborhood.

290
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:09,318
Absolutely.

291
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:10,396
Thank you, Council.

292
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:11,817
The Chair recognizes the Vice President.

293
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:13,978
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

294
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:19,701
I guess my question back to you, if you don't mind, maybe if you have the answer to elaborate.

295
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:35,128
I did email the Mayor myself last week with regards to this, because, you know, we've spoken out with our dissatisfaction on trucks parking on the sidewalk, Mack trucks, where people can't traverse our sidewalk.

296
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:41,164
I was very happy to hear that she was meeting with the chief of, that Mayor Burke was meeting with the chief of police.

297
00:25:41,884 --> 00:25:59,193
So if you, you know, maybe you can give us a little bit more detail on their, on their meeting, or if you don't have, you know, specific more, you know, or any more detailed information, maybe Mayor Burke wouldn't mind putting it in writing of exactly what the measures will be to alleviate that problem.

298
00:25:59,233 --> 00:26:03,696
You know, what was the directive to the chief specifically with regards to enforcement?

299
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:11,423
Because I think that's something we've asked for, and I think that I would like to see it in writing, specifically, what is going to be done?

300
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:19,507
How can we tell our residents that are complaining and continuing to send us pictures, what are we going to say to the residents that need to traverse the sidewalks?

301
00:26:20,188 --> 00:26:24,570
This is going to be done every day, 9, 12, and 5.

302
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:28,192
A police officer will be there to do some enforcement.

303
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,374
I would really like an update on that.

304
00:26:31,014 --> 00:26:34,316
And I'm very happy, again, to say that there was a meeting, and there is.

305
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:42,974
some push from the mayor's office for this enforcement, because I think I said it last week, we need the mayor on board with this or else it's not going to happen.

306
00:26:44,475 --> 00:26:53,020
I don't have any specific details as far as the steps A, B, C, and D, but I know she

307
00:26:54,263 --> 00:26:58,944
has indicated to me as well as the police chief has indicated to me that they both very serious about this.

308
00:26:59,524 --> 00:27:13,667
I'd also add that at the meeting, uh, efforts were made, uh, or, or people from, uh, code enforcement and the board of health were also, um, directed to examine some of the other complaints that were lodged there.

309
00:27:14,287 --> 00:27:23,809
So, um, uh, uh, as council president, uh, in, uh, someone who communicates regularly to the membership of the council from the mayor,

310
00:27:24,292 --> 00:27:26,513
But certainly you don't need me to do that.

311
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:31,334
But nonetheless, they're working on it.

312
00:27:31,454 --> 00:27:32,754
It seems quite clear.

313
00:27:33,274 --> 00:27:37,155
And I'm quite delighted to see such action taken.

314
00:27:37,895 --> 00:27:38,195
Me too.

315
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:45,997
If we could just possibly, if she wouldn't mind, Mayor Burke wouldn't mind just giving us a further update on that meeting.

316
00:27:46,017 --> 00:27:46,817
That would be helpful.

317
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:51,878
And we know what the Board of Health was asked to do, what the code enforcement, just to stay in the loop.

318
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:54,729
so that we can advise appropriately.

319
00:27:55,529 --> 00:27:55,849
Thank you.

320
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,631
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

321
00:27:59,652 --> 00:28:00,932
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

322
00:28:01,153 --> 00:28:12,360
Whereas the resolution before us is calling for an on-site committee of the whole meeting, it might make sense to invite the administration to come and present to us what their solutions are while we're all there together on location.

323
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,704
And looking at the issue, I mean, we'll talk about this till we're blue in the face, but it's an enforcement issue, Mr. President.

324
00:28:18,884 --> 00:28:19,845
It's an enforcement issue.

325
00:28:21,153 --> 00:28:24,094
vehicles parking on the street are being appropriately ticketed.

326
00:28:24,294 --> 00:28:26,015
And I think the answer that we all know is no.

327
00:28:27,236 --> 00:28:28,856
It's really a parking issue, Mr. President.

328
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:41,222
We need to figure out where we're going to put these vehicles when they need to make deliveries so that these businesses and our business districts can be successful, but so there's also a balance between the neighborhood and the business concerns, Mr. President.

329
00:28:41,242 --> 00:28:42,062
So with that being said,

330
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:50,622
I'd again like to amend the paper just the same way we did last week to ask for directed patrols at Harvard, Maine, and Yale during the day, Mr. President.

331
00:28:51,903 --> 00:29:00,249
So that our patrolmen, when they are out there, will make a concerted effort to continue to enforce the violators.

332
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:01,130
Thank you.

333
00:29:01,717 --> 00:29:05,341
And if I can also add, I apologize for speaking from the chair.

334
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:07,523
If anybody wishes me to stop, I will.

335
00:29:08,023 --> 00:29:12,047
But I also know that this will also be part of this.

336
00:29:12,107 --> 00:29:25,981
The subcommittee or the committee transition committee on economic and business development will give, as we have our neighborhood meetings, residents, store owners, and all will have ample opportunity to point out those areas.

337
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,604
that need improvement and see what works better in each of the business districts.

338
00:29:31,984 --> 00:29:45,814
In fact, we have our first meeting tomorrow night at the Roberts School to address Haines Square and all the details are available on the city website for that meeting because sometimes I get my times confused.

339
00:29:46,074 --> 00:29:47,856
Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

340
00:29:48,476 --> 00:29:49,237
Thank you, Mr. President.

341
00:29:49,277 --> 00:29:52,359
I just wanted to thank Councilor Marks for bringing up this resolution.

342
00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:52,799
Um, uh,

343
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,511
we've all received many emails regarding this issue.

344
00:29:57,551 --> 00:30:01,331
And it's a public safety issue that needs to be addressed as soon as possible.

345
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:07,632
So I'm hoping that the subcommittee can hopefully take action on this soon so we can have the committee, the whole meeting ASAP.

346
00:30:07,832 --> 00:30:14,053
And I just wanted to also thank the resident for bringing this to our attention.

347
00:30:14,293 --> 00:30:19,574
We've received many emails and it's important that people reach out to us when they do have problems in their neighborhoods.

348
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:23,575
And I just want to say support this a hundred percent.

349
00:30:24,191 --> 00:30:25,011
Thank you, Councillor.

350
00:30:25,612 --> 00:30:25,972
Thank you.

351
00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:28,733
Good evening.

352
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:29,153
Welcome.

353
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:30,434
Please state your name and address for the record.

354
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:30,934
Good evening.

355
00:30:31,074 --> 00:30:33,235
Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street.

356
00:30:34,155 --> 00:30:36,956
I thank you for bringing this to the fore.

357
00:30:37,537 --> 00:30:38,757
It's been a long time coming.

358
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:44,139
Thank you, Councillor Lungo and Councillor Marks for putting it on the agenda.

359
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,780
It's going to be a joint effort.

360
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,281
It's true.

361
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:48,621
It's enforcement.

362
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:50,342
That's a very large piece.

363
00:30:51,073 --> 00:30:56,917
But we are not unaware of the fact that these businesses have to function successfully to remain there.

364
00:30:57,577 --> 00:31:03,301
And we'd like to help in terms of actually having a place for them to make the deliveries.

365
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:12,967
But that's safe and not on sidewalks and not interrupting the peaceful enjoyment of our homes and our streets.

366
00:31:13,848 --> 00:31:16,549
So I look forward to action on this.

367
00:31:16,629 --> 00:31:17,130
I hope that

368
00:31:18,474 --> 00:31:21,176
We as residents will be invited to participate.

369
00:31:21,816 --> 00:31:29,760
I also hope that the businesses will participate because it's actually, they are benefiting greatly from this if we do in fact get a loading zone.

370
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:38,825
I know on Yale Street, the curb that was once dropped has now been restored and I think it obviates the need for the bollards.

371
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:45,729
So I don't think we need bollards at that point as long as that is enforced and we don't have people

372
00:31:46,136 --> 00:31:49,719
driving up over the curb to park next to the building, which is what they were doing.

373
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:58,305
And also we need clear definition of where the handicap ramp is, access ramp is.

374
00:31:58,345 --> 00:32:05,791
We need markings on the loading zone and pedestrian walkway there.

375
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:08,153
The handicap access is not marked.

376
00:32:08,673 --> 00:32:11,515
People do park right over that.

377
00:32:11,956 --> 00:32:14,818
So there are many aspects of this.

378
00:32:15,815 --> 00:32:19,858
I, for one, would enjoy participating in finding resolutions to this.

379
00:32:20,278 --> 00:32:23,161
I know some people were upset with the curb going back up.

380
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,162
I think they've calmed down somewhat.

381
00:32:25,602 --> 00:32:33,328
But I also know that the delivery guys from May's Cafe, for instance, are not using the loading zone on Yale Street.

382
00:32:33,528 --> 00:32:35,129
It's a designated loading zone.

383
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:36,190
It's not marked off.

384
00:32:36,651 --> 00:32:37,471
There is a sign.

385
00:32:38,052 --> 00:32:41,214
I asked him, he walks all the way down to the public lot.

386
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:44,042
to get in his car and make the deliveries.

387
00:32:44,122 --> 00:32:45,962
I said, why aren't you using the loading zone?

388
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:47,023
He said, he gets ticketed.

389
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:55,126
So perhaps there can be some immediate action to inform them that maybe they can park there to make deliveries.

390
00:32:55,186 --> 00:33:04,149
Maybe something could be indicated in that regard so they're not getting ticketed and they're parking at the beginning of Yale rather than in the public lot and walking down.

391
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:07,470
And people's food will be getting cold when they get it brought to the door.

392
00:33:09,184 --> 00:33:12,366
As a resident, I'm more than willing to cooperate with the businesses.

393
00:33:12,426 --> 00:33:19,391
It's just it has become an issue of safety, and we've been going round and round and round with this.

394
00:33:19,471 --> 00:33:24,695
Now I hope we can finally find a path to move forward on it.

395
00:33:25,275 --> 00:33:33,341
I know you've all seen the pictures that Mrs. Fritz provided, and one picture is worth a thousand words.

396
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:36,589
It speaks for itself.

397
00:33:36,689 --> 00:33:38,470
We want to eradicate that problem.

398
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,793
And I'm more than willing to do my part.

399
00:33:43,114 --> 00:33:45,356
And hopefully, the city will do theirs.

400
00:33:45,596 --> 00:33:47,397
It looks as though we're moving forward on this.

401
00:33:47,438 --> 00:33:49,439
So I have some hope.

402
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,864
And hopefully, we'll resolve this satisfactorily for all concerned.

403
00:33:55,564 --> 00:33:55,964
Thank you.

404
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:00,308
Good evening.

405
00:34:00,368 --> 00:34:00,768
Welcome.

406
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,450
Please state your name and address for the record.

407
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,250
Good evening.

408
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,212
Anne Fretz, 215 Harvard Street.

409
00:34:06,068 --> 00:34:17,719
And to pick up on Anita's last comment, I had a quote written by Stephen Mamet, the playwright, who said, we all hope it's what keeps us alive, which is what keeps me coming back here ad nauseum.

410
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,501
My apologies for appearing again.

411
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:26,147
First of all, I wish to thank the city council members for allowing me to frequently appear before you, sending feedback about our neighborhood.

412
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:33,342
respond to phone calls, and meet with us to discuss existing public safety conditions and potential solutions.

413
00:34:33,402 --> 00:34:37,945
We have lots of ideas, yet we don't have any solution as of yet.

414
00:34:38,865 --> 00:34:47,270
In particular, I want to thank Michael Marks for the bus stop resolution being addressed today, and Brianna Longo-Cohen for last week's parking enforcement discussion.

415
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:54,034
I also want to express my gratitude to Directors Karen Rose and Paul Mokey, Inspector Kimberly Fowler,

416
00:34:54,633 --> 00:35:10,003
and constant resource building and code enforcement officer, John Bevuso, and Mayor Burke, in particular, for responding to requests for assistance for residents confronting a variety of health and quality of life issues at 159 Harvard Street.

417
00:35:10,023 --> 00:35:14,686
I'm grateful for their prompt actions and involvement in several long-term issues.

418
00:35:14,907 --> 00:35:17,929
I really want to thank all of you, in particular Mayor Burke.

419
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:27,973
Our South Medford Square is a troubled square impacted by the rapid and unfettered growth of one restaurant.

420
00:35:28,594 --> 00:35:34,621
We need corrective action to improve the quality of life for residents, the business owners, and the general public.

421
00:35:35,262 --> 00:35:39,567
Mayor Burke has planned economic meetings to assess where we are and where we need to be.

422
00:35:40,122 --> 00:35:44,744
for Medford's commercial success, satisfying the residents in the area.

423
00:35:45,084 --> 00:35:46,304
I totally support this.

424
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:48,405
It's the best way to proceed.

425
00:35:48,765 --> 00:36:00,889
The bus stop move, like the need for more parking enforcement, cannot wait as it's critical for public safety, necessary for the survival of current commerce in all residents in South Medford Square neighborhood.

426
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:05,911
We've been addressing this concern for about three years with no change to the current situation.

427
00:36:06,703 --> 00:36:09,665
pretty much flaming out with physical risk to the public, escalating.

428
00:36:10,185 --> 00:36:23,612
There does seem to be some measure of public enforcement, but driving down there yesterday, I noticed we now have bike motorcycles tied to the posts on the sidewalks on Harvard, on Main Street.

429
00:36:24,152 --> 00:36:25,213
There were some this summer.

430
00:36:25,253 --> 00:36:26,253
There are more there now.

431
00:36:26,273 --> 00:36:33,017
I don't know if they're employees or customers of Oasis, but it's a motor vehicle that drives up onto the sidewalk.

432
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:40,180
Residents and the general public need safe sidewalks to walk on, healthier to breathe.

433
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,562
School children and school buses who terminate at that corner need a safe zone for stops and walking.

434
00:36:46,862 --> 00:36:53,205
And the MBTA serving all citizens need a safe place to disembark and get on the bus.

435
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:59,007
They need to have it closed as these ladies have often mentioned.

436
00:36:59,744 --> 00:37:10,727
Currently, it's safer to walk on Main Street sometimes than it is to walk on the Harvard Street sidewalks, given the flow of traffic on the sidewalks, including the motorcycles, customer vehicles, delivery trucks, and bicycles.

437
00:37:11,947 --> 00:37:18,748
Reasons point to unchecked growth in a densely populated area, part of which I'm guilty of.

438
00:37:18,808 --> 00:37:22,709
We had 100 people move into the Lincoln-Kennedy condos during 2009 and 2010.

439
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:34,483
Prior to that, in 2006, Oasis owners spent a million dollars to buy a block of stores.

440
00:37:35,123 --> 00:37:45,852
They increased their small business area with limited seating to three storefronts on half the block, operating from 6 a.m.

441
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:49,154
to 11 a.m., whether they had a permit to do so or not.

442
00:37:50,855 --> 00:37:56,540
They are now able to accommodate 200 seated guests or more in a restaurant.

443
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:07,068
So we basically doubled the number of seats in a restaurant, the number of vehicles in that particular square over a very short period of time, over a four or five year period.

444
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:12,093
None of the abutters were informed of the two expansions that Oasis went through.

445
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,955
This is one thing we should look at with our city ordinances.

446
00:38:15,515 --> 00:38:17,297
How did they expand so rapidly?

447
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:26,149
without any notice to us, the abutters, any input from the abutters, and now we're seeing the results of it and begging for support.

448
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:36,251
Two expansions, just double the size right to what Bocelli said, and forgive me for repeating myself.

449
00:38:37,032 --> 00:38:47,334
All of these expansions occurred without City Hall prior to 2016, adjusting limits, lending advice, or building a commerce support system

450
00:38:47,848 --> 00:39:00,898
such as moving a loading zone or adding a loading zone to support Oasis fitting into an already established neighborhood that was also expanding at the same time.

451
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:09,024
I believe that Ron Lopez purchased the Lincoln School and the Kennedy School in 2007, and our unit was completed in 2010.

452
00:39:09,104 --> 00:39:16,670
This is a side note, but Oasis tripled in size over the past

453
00:39:17,505 --> 00:39:34,777
three years without increasing the size of their waste management facilities until the neighbors intervened due to chronically overflowing dumpsters filled to the brim and doubling the size with their smelly trash.

454
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:37,139
That promoted the growth of rats in the area.

455
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:42,583
The people who live at 159 have had rats infiltrating their patio during the summer.

456
00:39:43,307 --> 00:39:51,093
that was brought into control, yet we're seeing them again from in front of their condo all the way down to Berwick, on the street, alive and dead.

457
00:39:51,653 --> 00:39:54,255
So that's one of the issues that the city is addressing at this point.

458
00:39:56,277 --> 00:40:04,543
Neighbors of South Medford Square have long felt their concerns have gone unheard or dismissed, much like the first complaints by the residents of Flint, Michigan, who complained about the water.

459
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:10,308
We are of the opinion that parking enforcement is but one measure that can greatly improve residents' quality of life

460
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:14,390
and easing of stress on the businesses in South Mesa Square.

461
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:23,896
We've been advocating through all relevant avenues available to us for City Hall to enforce the town's laws or the city's laws.

462
00:40:24,377 --> 00:40:26,458
These are not laws we're asking for.

463
00:40:26,498 --> 00:40:27,599
These are laws that exist.

464
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,524
If you look at a parking ticket or a parking violation, parking on sidewalks, parking on hash marks, they're all there.

465
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:38,347
We just don't have the manpower in the public

466
00:40:39,888 --> 00:40:48,994
safety groups, whether it be the Republic Parking or the Police Department, to support our own laws.

467
00:40:50,295 --> 00:40:51,576
And I think that's going to change.

468
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:54,138
I can hope that changes with Mayor Burke.

469
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:04,405
We need to support the Traffic Division, specifically in the Police Department, to move the trailer trucks and haulers off Harvard Street.

470
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:06,887
We have many roadblocks and naysayers,

471
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,921
that add to this.

472
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:10,202
We're not just dealing with trucks on the sidewalk.

473
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:12,484
We're dealing with them hauling back and forth.

474
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,165
So it's a tremendous area.

475
00:41:17,848 --> 00:41:22,052
For a long time, we didn't have the commercial centers with shops and restaurants.

476
00:41:22,512 --> 00:41:35,342
So said Medford native Nancy McLaughlin, as she was writing about the newly proclaimed hottest city in Boston, the South Medford neighborhood, which is great.

477
00:41:37,047 --> 00:41:42,530
And we would like to see everyone coming to our South Medford Square and improve the area.

478
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:54,255
I know that City Councilor Mr. DelaRusso, Mr. President, and Anita D'Antonio and I shared some of those discussions on what we could do to draw.

479
00:41:54,836 --> 00:42:03,840
Oasis is a huge draw for Main Street, as is Bocelli, as evidenced by the constant replenishment of food, beverages, and supplies to their location by the purveyors.

480
00:42:04,642 --> 00:42:08,887
Unfortunately, their rapid and unsupported growth has been at the expense of the residents in the neighborhood.

481
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:10,348
I can't emphasize that more.

482
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:11,970
We just didn't have any say in it.

483
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:12,791
It just happened.

484
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:19,559
We've been asking for support and help to help them be a better neighbor to us.

485
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:23,263
And we can go through everything they're doing wrong, but that's not fair to them at this point.

486
00:42:28,564 --> 00:42:50,895
I would just like to say that moving the bus stop, installing five or six no parking, no standing, no stopping signs from the corner of Harvard and Main Street at the traffic lights down to the driveway at 215 Harvard Street would be a huge improvement.

487
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:56,378
It would also be a temporary blockage to anyone wishing to park along the sidewalk there.

488
00:42:57,379 --> 00:43:03,824
Right now, it wouldn't cost more than $500 for the raw material of the posts and the signs.

489
00:43:04,605 --> 00:43:11,611
Add the labor costs in to dig holes, and what you would encounter putting them in there would be earth.

490
00:43:12,471 --> 00:43:19,757
As Councilman Caraviello said, there's pits now where we used to have grass.

491
00:43:20,258 --> 00:43:23,380
There's cracked concrete, which the signs can be driven through.

492
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:26,483
And there's probably two areas where you would have to actually drill a hole.

493
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:28,379
That's something we could do tomorrow.

494
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:34,282
That's something I would urge having done until we can move the bus stop and change everything.

495
00:43:34,943 --> 00:43:38,545
What putting those signs up will do will protect the residents in the area.

496
00:43:38,925 --> 00:43:40,146
We can't use our sidewalks.

497
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:42,587
My little dog will be two years old in May.

498
00:43:43,548 --> 00:43:45,869
We don't walk the sidewalks down there because it's unsafe.

499
00:43:45,989 --> 00:43:49,171
We haven't been able to walk on them for about a year and a half now.

500
00:43:50,092 --> 00:43:55,215
I thank you all for your time and your effort to change this, but I would urge that we do a committee of the whole.

501
00:43:55,918 --> 00:44:03,302
and do a physical tour, as we did back in October of 2014, and recognize the needs and deal with it.

502
00:44:03,362 --> 00:44:04,102
Thank you for your time.

503
00:44:04,882 --> 00:44:05,923
Thank you very much, Anne.

504
00:44:07,123 --> 00:44:09,665
On the motion of Councilman Marks' approval, all those in favor?

505
00:44:09,685 --> 00:44:11,365
As amended.

506
00:44:11,405 --> 00:44:11,786
As amended.

507
00:44:12,326 --> 00:44:12,906
Councilman Marks.

508
00:44:13,306 --> 00:44:14,647
Just if I could, Mr. President.

509
00:44:14,787 --> 00:44:15,327
On that motion.

510
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:22,931
I think Anne brings up a great temporary fix for the Harvard Main Corner with the signage that she mentioned.

511
00:44:23,851 --> 00:44:25,472
So I would ask that this council send

512
00:44:25,916 --> 00:44:28,918
that recommendation, Mr. President, to the Traffic Commission.

513
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:30,780
And it's only a temporary fix.

514
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:38,846
But the no standing, no stopping signs, how many they believe is needed, you said four or five, but six.

515
00:44:39,186 --> 00:44:47,092
Whatever the Traffic Commission feels is necessary to solve that issue, Mr. President, I would ask that that be sent.

516
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:54,638
Also, Anne mentioned about method, assault method in particular.

517
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:57,093
receiving recognition, Mr. President.

518
00:44:57,774 --> 00:45:04,098
And that is a real estate brokerage firm, Redfin, which is a nationally known real estate brokerage firm.

519
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:08,040
Once a year, it comes out with their three hottest Boston neighborhoods.

520
00:45:08,961 --> 00:45:12,583
And, you know, it's amazing to see Method No.

521
00:45:12,603 --> 00:45:14,885
1, Cambridge and Somerville 2 and 3.

522
00:45:16,286 --> 00:45:18,727
You see how the tide is changing, Mr. President.

523
00:45:19,128 --> 00:45:23,751
And it's incumbent upon us and groups like Smato and other

524
00:45:24,818 --> 00:45:28,500
involved residents in the South Meffitt area to keep doing what they're doing.

525
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:35,364
Because they're not doing it on behalf of themselves, they're doing it on behalf of improving the quality of life in that neighborhood.

526
00:45:35,904 --> 00:45:43,488
And we're already seeing the benefits of being named number one hottest market, real estate market, in Boston.

527
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:51,793
That's an amazing, amazing feat, Mr. President, knowing that, in my opinion, very little has been done.

528
00:45:51,813 --> 00:45:54,236
You know, and I'm not speaking out of school.

529
00:45:54,516 --> 00:46:05,946
Very little has been done in the South Method area, Mr. President, to improve any type of pedestrian safety, to improve traffic flow, to improve business and economic development in the area.

530
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:09,570
And, you know, we're seeing that it's a hot market.

531
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:29,680
And I think as a community, it's incumbent upon us to parlay that into really moving forward these traffic improvements, pedestrian safety improvements, and making the South Meffitt area something that our neighboring communities will envy, Mr. President.

532
00:46:30,441 --> 00:46:36,005
The same way we envied what they did in Somerville and a lot of their

533
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:40,404
business districts, we could be that, Mr. President.

534
00:46:40,925 --> 00:46:47,690
And I think it's starting to make a turn, but only if the city is able to cooperate and move these issues forward.

535
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:55,777
So I just want to thank Anne Fretz and Anita D'Antonio for coming up tonight.

536
00:46:56,097 --> 00:47:05,085
I want to thank Jim Silva from the Salt Method Neighborhood Group, SMARTO, who organizes a lot of what goes on in that area.

537
00:47:05,913 --> 00:47:08,394
uh, gets feedback from area residents.

538
00:47:09,135 --> 00:47:16,679
And, uh, I look forward, Mr. President, to assault method that, uh, we're all going to be very proud of, uh, in the future, Mr. President.

539
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:18,040
Thank you.

540
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,061
Counselor as amended, Mr. Clerk.

541
00:47:20,882 --> 00:47:21,462
Counselor Knight.

542
00:47:21,802 --> 00:47:24,323
Um, Mr. President, I'd ask that the questions be separated.

543
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:28,926
Um, although I understand the reasoning for counselor marks, bringing the last portion of the last amendment up.

544
00:47:29,366 --> 00:47:30,507
Um, if the purpose of,

545
00:47:31,153 --> 00:47:39,296
the council to go on site to have a committee of the whole meeting to talk with the traffic commission to see what we can do to move the bus stop and to improve the loading zone.

546
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:50,921
Um, I think that maybe we want to start from scratch and if we go down there and we already stopped making recommendations without first sitting down and actually having the dialogue, I think that we're putting the cot a little bit before the horse, Mr. President.

547
00:47:51,361 --> 00:47:52,562
Um, so I'd ask that the, uh,

548
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,261
the amendments be separated and be severed.

549
00:47:55,961 --> 00:47:59,023
Um, I'm fully supportive of all the other amendments that were filed.

550
00:47:59,063 --> 00:48:06,866
However, at this point in time, I'm not comfortable supporting, um, the erection of any signage until we can go actually on site and meet with the traffic commission to talk about what the options are.

551
00:48:07,106 --> 00:48:15,670
So the resolution is that the Memphis city council, uh, uh, actually it would be the president of the city council would call for a committee of the whole meeting on site.

552
00:48:16,273 --> 00:48:20,916
to relocate the bus stop and request the Traffic Commission to create a loading zone.

553
00:48:20,936 --> 00:48:24,178
So you want to separate Traffic Commission and create a loading zone.

554
00:48:24,218 --> 00:48:26,519
That was the initial paper, right?

555
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:26,939
Right.

556
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:32,742
So a yea vote would vote to put the Committee of the Whole process in session, in motion rather.

557
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:33,123
Right.

558
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:39,066
Then I amended for directed patrols at the area until we can get this meeting done, right?

559
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:39,346
Correct.

560
00:48:39,366 --> 00:48:41,027
And we've had several other amendments as well.

561
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:42,428
And there were several other amendments as well.

562
00:48:43,195 --> 00:48:48,757
I really just have a problem with the amendment of putting up signage at this point in time if we're going down there to try to determine what's going to work best.

563
00:48:49,357 --> 00:48:56,119
I think that we should go down there and have an actual picture of what's going on as opposed to changing what's going on there right now and then going down and taking a look.

564
00:48:56,139 --> 00:49:01,560
I mean, if we're going on the site, if we're going on the site to see the problems, we put up the signs, the problems aren't going to be there anymore, right?

565
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:06,502
So why aren't we going to go down there and witness what these problems are, show what actual effect it is having on the neighborhood.

566
00:49:06,542 --> 00:49:08,262
I mean, we've all heard it before, Mr. President.

567
00:49:08,302 --> 00:49:09,122
There's no doubt about that.

568
00:49:10,063 --> 00:49:11,403
However, I think that it would be best to be

569
00:49:12,163 --> 00:49:13,303
to be dealt with at a clean slate.

570
00:49:13,323 --> 00:49:17,625
Let's go down there and let's take a look at it in its current state of disrepair so that we can come up with a comprehensive plan.

571
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:24,228
First point of information, counsel, and I appreciate what council and I just had to say.

572
00:49:24,248 --> 00:49:28,470
Uh, I consider this, uh, like the residents of temporary fix.

573
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:37,734
Uh, as we heard from the council president, uh, this particular issue is already in the transportation subcommittee, so it has to be voted on by the transportation subcommittee.

574
00:49:38,154 --> 00:49:40,995
If I'm correct, Mr. President, I think that's what you were alluding to.

575
00:49:41,752 --> 00:49:50,335
And, uh, the, uh, it's under the council purview to move the bus stop, but the loading zone is not under the council purview.

576
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:51,695
That would be under the traffic commission.

577
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:53,696
So then we have to take another step.

578
00:49:53,756 --> 00:50:00,117
Even when we do eventually move the bus stop, we have to wait for the traffic commission request, which, but they don't meet every day.

579
00:50:00,177 --> 00:50:03,418
They meet twice a month, once a month.

580
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:08,840
So you may be talking several months out before, and I know you're saying enforcement,

581
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:13,667
But in my opinion, the enforcement will happen for a day or two, and then it'll stop happening.

582
00:50:13,947 --> 00:50:14,948
That's only my opinion.

583
00:50:15,608 --> 00:50:19,052
And I'd rather have signage at least there on a temporary basis.

584
00:50:19,512 --> 00:50:22,234
But I don't mind separating, because I'm going to vote.

585
00:50:22,254 --> 00:50:29,120
Yeah, I mean, I don't think we should put up any signage if we're going to go down there and ask the traffic commission to do a comprehensive review and to go forward and to come up with a plan.

586
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:29,881
Let's let them do that.

587
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:31,963
But we're asking for enforcement anyhow.

588
00:50:32,373 --> 00:50:33,154
So let's get the enforcement.

589
00:50:33,174 --> 00:50:34,536
People know they're not supposed to park on the sidewalk.

590
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:35,857
I think that that's clear.

591
00:50:35,897 --> 00:50:39,982
It's just a matter of them ignoring the rules, regulations, and so forth, Mr. President.

592
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:41,824
So with that being said, I rest my case.

593
00:50:41,944 --> 00:50:43,546
I think I've explained where I'm coming from.

594
00:50:43,566 --> 00:50:44,827
So you still have the motion to sever?

595
00:50:44,987 --> 00:50:46,089
I would have a motion to sever, yes.

596
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:50,033
It can just be the last amendment, Mr. President, because I'm fully supportive of the rest of the paper.

597
00:50:50,454 --> 00:50:51,695
OK.

598
00:50:52,276 --> 00:50:52,436
Ma'am.

599
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:55,614
Hi, Anne Fretz, 215 Harvard Street.

600
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:59,595
Long-suffering, blocked sidewalks, unable to walk down them.

601
00:50:59,615 --> 00:51:06,177
It was last year, October 27, 2015, asking for relief from the area.

602
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:16,420
I don't know how many weeks it is or how many days or how many trucks, but even with the parking enforcement, people don't respect the world of

603
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:18,331
No parking on the sidewalks.

604
00:51:18,371 --> 00:51:24,673
I've written God knows how many letters to the truck haulers themselves, the presidents of the company, and it continues.

605
00:51:25,113 --> 00:51:30,915
I don't understand why we can't put a temporary measure up for public safety to protect pedestrians.

606
00:51:31,395 --> 00:51:32,256
This is ridiculous.

607
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:32,876
Thank you.

608
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,456
Forgive me for getting so upset.

609
00:51:35,076 --> 00:51:37,957
But to let you know, Jim Silva would be here this evening.

610
00:51:38,017 --> 00:51:41,438
He's away on vacation, a much deserved vacation supporting the city.

611
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:46,720
And I put a resolution with a list of 10 items, one of which was

612
00:51:47,197 --> 00:52:03,610
temporary installation of no parking, no stopping, no standing signs for the length of Harvard Street, where I might add that bollards were approved to be installed and were never installed around the corner to prevent trucks from parking on the parking lot.

613
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:04,931
We're going nowhere.

614
00:52:05,591 --> 00:52:06,832
We've got parking enforcement.

615
00:52:06,992 --> 00:52:09,214
And as Mr. Marks kindly said,

616
00:52:09,853 --> 00:52:13,055
It lasts for a day, they relax, and the trucks come back.

617
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:14,116
It's cyclical.

618
00:52:14,457 --> 00:52:15,938
We've seen three years of it.

619
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:17,259
I'm starting to froth at the mouth.

620
00:52:17,739 --> 00:52:18,239
Thank you.

621
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,240
Thank you all.

622
00:52:21,622 --> 00:52:26,405
On the motion for approval, we have a motion to sever all those in.

623
00:52:26,425 --> 00:52:28,287
This is the last amendment.

624
00:52:28,307 --> 00:52:28,687
The last amendment.

625
00:52:28,707 --> 00:52:29,588
Councilor Caravaglio.

626
00:52:29,888 --> 00:52:30,548
I have a question.

627
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:37,554
I don't know if our DPW has access to those plastic jersey barriers.

628
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:48,605
maybe that would be a faster solution to put maybe some of those up there instead of signs that say, I don't know, I don't, I don't know if we have them in our city.

629
00:52:48,906 --> 00:52:50,787
I might tend to stand this as a resolution.

630
00:52:51,627 --> 00:53:05,856
I'm just asking that we look into if the city, if the city has plastic, uh, they, they have Jersey barriers that are plastic and they can go in, uh, almost immediately and come out as, uh, uh, as, as needed.

631
00:53:06,276 --> 00:53:06,676
Very good.

632
00:53:07,037 --> 00:53:09,138
So if we look at the, uh,

633
00:53:09,615 --> 00:53:12,576
DPW installed temporary plastic.

634
00:53:12,736 --> 00:53:16,358
If they have them in the building, they may have them at that size.

635
00:53:16,398 --> 00:53:17,738
And they'll be able to go up tomorrow?

636
00:53:18,399 --> 00:53:18,599
Yes.

637
00:53:19,259 --> 00:53:20,579
Chair recognizes Councilor Falcone.

638
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,600
Thank you, Mr. President.

639
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,500
I have a quick question.

640
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,621
I'm not sure if you know the answer to this.

641
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,262
But do we know when the bollards were approved?

642
00:53:27,122 --> 00:53:27,682
I don't know that.

643
00:53:27,702 --> 00:53:30,063
And that's prior to me being elected, so I'm just kind of just.

644
00:53:30,103 --> 00:53:36,326
That would be a communication from the Traffic Commission to inform us of that.

645
00:53:41,225 --> 00:53:42,546
So it's been a whole year?

646
00:53:42,846 --> 00:53:43,366
Yes.

647
00:53:45,828 --> 00:53:47,849
Do we know who's responsible for installing those?

648
00:53:47,869 --> 00:53:49,350
Do we know why they haven't been installed?

649
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:52,271
Do we know if we paid for them and they've just never been installed?

650
00:53:52,371 --> 00:53:53,872
I mean, these are questions that I have.

651
00:53:53,932 --> 00:53:55,093
I'm kind of curious.

652
00:53:55,613 --> 00:53:56,734
A whole year has gone by.

653
00:53:57,274 --> 00:53:58,275
Some have been installed.

654
00:54:00,194 --> 00:54:01,275
Two or three, and two or three.

655
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:03,235
One councilor at a time, please.

656
00:54:03,295 --> 00:54:09,457
I was down in the neighborhood last night, and Councilor Caviello was there as well.

657
00:54:09,937 --> 00:54:13,738
And we noticed there were two bollards that were installed in the corner of Harvard and Main.

658
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:15,639
Do we know when those were installed?

659
00:54:16,899 --> 00:54:17,860
During the fall.

660
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,060
Yeah, the fall.

661
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:19,120
OK.

662
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:28,363
October of 2015, and those were two men, cars from Oasis vehicles were driving through the handicapped family.

663
00:54:32,684 --> 00:54:44,011
And those aren't really doing the job because there's still, I've seen the pictures, all four wheels of these trucks are on top of the sidewalk, which is completely, does not make any sense at all.

664
00:54:44,071 --> 00:54:46,913
So I think Council Member Marks had mentioned it before.

665
00:54:46,933 --> 00:54:52,717
It really sounds like we need to install bollards up a good portion of Harvard Ave.

666
00:54:52,958 --> 00:54:54,599
So thank you.

667
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,621
Ma'am, you wish to speak to us?

668
00:54:57,741 --> 00:54:58,161
Welcome.

669
00:54:58,281 --> 00:55:00,603
Please state your name and address for the record.

670
00:55:02,265 --> 00:55:06,106
Mixed J. Spaulding, 3610 Mystic Valley Parkway, Bedford, Mass.

671
00:55:07,047 --> 00:55:15,769
And I'm wondering if we aren't circling the wagon about trucks being on the sidewalk here.

672
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:17,370
This isn't unique to Oasis.

673
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:24,252
Last week we were talking about the exact same thing regarding commercial vehicles parking on sidewalks throughout the city of Medford.

674
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:33,258
whether or not you put ballards or a plastic cone out, if there's no enforcement, there's no enforcement.

675
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:49,429
So I'm wondering if we've heard back from Chief Sacco, I know that the mayor spoke with him, but until we find out about enforcement regarding parking, we're gonna continue to have these issues and they're not unique to Oasis, not at all.

676
00:55:51,611 --> 00:55:51,951
Thank you.

677
00:55:52,211 --> 00:55:53,532
Thank you, on the motion.

678
00:55:55,987 --> 00:55:58,448
as severed and as amended.

679
00:55:59,728 --> 00:56:01,949
So on the severed piece was for the signs?

680
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:07,271
The erection of temporary signs.

681
00:56:07,771 --> 00:56:08,692
All those in favor?

682
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:10,932
All those opposed?

683
00:56:11,853 --> 00:56:14,434
Mark Councillor Knight as opposed.

684
00:56:15,294 --> 00:56:16,134
Motion passes.

685
00:56:17,315 --> 00:56:19,755
On the main motion as amended, all those in favor?

686
00:56:21,776 --> 00:56:24,277
A roll call vote has been requested for the main motion.

687
00:56:24,842 --> 00:56:27,303
Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

688
00:56:28,263 --> 00:56:29,183
Councilor Caviello?

689
00:56:29,463 --> 00:56:29,683
Yes.

690
00:56:30,263 --> 00:56:30,863
Councilor Felco?

691
00:56:30,923 --> 00:56:31,023
Yes.

692
00:56:31,884 --> 00:56:32,384
Councilor Knight?

693
00:56:32,464 --> 00:56:32,724
Yes.

694
00:56:33,504 --> 00:56:34,424
Vice President Lowell-Kern?

695
00:56:34,544 --> 00:56:34,724
Yes.

696
00:56:35,344 --> 00:56:35,985
Councilor Marks?

697
00:56:36,225 --> 00:56:36,585
Yes.

698
00:56:37,105 --> 00:56:38,005
Councilor Scott Kelly?

699
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:39,665
Absent.

700
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:41,366
President Del Rosso?

701
00:56:41,706 --> 00:56:42,086
Yes.

702
00:56:42,146 --> 00:56:45,347
With the vote of seven, uh, six in the affirmative, one absent.

703
00:56:45,367 --> 00:56:46,207
The motion carries.

704
00:56:46,687 --> 00:56:47,527
Congratulations.

705
00:56:47,547 --> 00:56:50,568
16-050 offered by Councilor Caviello.

706
00:56:51,315 --> 00:57:02,780
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council discuss and hold public hearings regarding moving the bus stop from 17 to 19 Main Street to Riverside Avenue and reversing the direction of River Street on a temporary basis.

707
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,301
Councilor, pair of yellow.

708
00:57:05,761 --> 00:57:06,542
Thank you, Mr. President.

709
00:57:06,722 --> 00:57:20,108
This is something we discussed earlier in the evening, um, uh, in regards to moving the bus stop on a temporary basis, uh, to alleviate some of the traffic and, uh, confusion, uh, that comes, uh, at that 1719 area.

710
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:30,355
It was my suggestion, and this council from last year's suggestion, that we move the bus stop to Riverside Avenue on a temporary basis.

711
00:57:30,715 --> 00:57:43,037
There's already a cut out there, versus moving it under the bridge, which would be, I think, a further hindrance to have people walk all that way under a dark underpass.

712
00:57:44,117 --> 00:57:49,318
Whereas you can move it into a business district, it's lit, there's other buses that stop there.

713
00:57:51,217 --> 00:58:06,923
I think that would be the least of the inconvenience up to the T. And probably the only, the only, the hottest part would be, would be the buses that come down Salem Street that would normally stop there.

714
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:10,064
That poses a little bit of a problem.

715
00:58:10,664 --> 00:58:15,386
And my only other suggestion would be to let them turn onto River Street.

716
00:58:16,786 --> 00:58:18,507
And there is a natural cut out there.

717
00:58:19,092 --> 00:58:23,076
and put the parking that's on that side to the other side of the street, Mr. President.

718
00:58:23,637 --> 00:58:26,540
And again, so they can just turn and make the loop and continue on.

719
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,602
So I don't know what the process is.

720
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:33,707
Do we need to hold a public hearing or is this something that we do on our own?

721
00:58:34,348 --> 00:58:39,473
I believe when we had a rather incoherent presentation on this a year or two ago,

722
00:58:40,112 --> 00:58:58,583
and the lead up to the construction process of the Craddock Bridge, we were reminded finally and quite clearly from representatives from the MBTA that any change in route of a bus may only be approved by the MBTA.

723
00:58:58,883 --> 00:59:07,588
And my consultation with the city solicitor, he pointed out that in fact the council does have the power to move a bus stop

724
00:59:08,037 --> 00:59:16,619
But that process must be done, or ought to be done, or should be done under the consultation of the Traffic Commission.

725
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:25,020
If we could refer this matter to the Traffic Commission for the next meeting, I'd be happy to attend that meeting, Mr. President.

726
00:59:25,321 --> 00:59:25,641
Very good.

727
00:59:25,921 --> 00:59:30,382
So on the motion of Councilor Caviello that, oh, I'm sorry, Madam Vice President.

728
00:59:31,182 --> 00:59:32,682
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

729
00:59:32,742 --> 00:59:36,843
And I do think this needs a discussion, but I also want to just make sure we get

730
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:39,731
Diane McLeod involved.

731
00:59:40,151 --> 00:59:49,495
I've received two or three emails from her within the last year or so with regards to her objection to moving the sidewalk.

732
00:59:49,535 --> 00:59:52,856
So I just think maybe a discussion needs to be had, which includes her.

733
00:59:53,096 --> 00:59:54,897
So I agree with your public hearing.

734
00:59:54,937 --> 01:00:02,280
I believe, you know, there's so many different things that need to be done in that area with construction, which is why we met with MassDOT today at 530.

735
01:00:03,922 --> 01:00:12,566
But I think she needs to come to the table because she has outwardly spoken out as we had somebody on that commission as well before us at 5.30.

736
01:00:13,266 --> 01:00:15,167
So I just want to include her.

737
01:00:15,187 --> 01:00:21,310
Why don't you send it to the Transportation Committee of the Council instead of them?

738
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:23,871
Okay, if that's a suggestion, Mr. President.

739
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:30,574
All right, so we're not going to send it to the Traffic Commission, but we're going to send that to the Committee on Traffic.

740
01:00:31,114 --> 01:00:32,655
That would be Mr. Scott Pelley's commission?

741
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:33,902
Chairman Scarpelli.

742
01:00:34,182 --> 01:00:35,082
Okay, I'll jam on that.

743
01:00:35,343 --> 01:00:37,863
And we are going to send it to the Traffic Commission also, correct?

744
01:00:38,003 --> 01:00:42,644
Why don't we maybe let them send it or invite the Traffic Commission to be part of that?

745
01:00:42,664 --> 01:00:49,226
Well, because we'll miss the meeting if we, because they meet at the end of the month.

746
01:00:50,746 --> 01:00:51,686
Then we'll send it to both.

747
01:00:52,006 --> 01:00:52,966
Okay, we'll do both.

748
01:00:54,107 --> 01:00:54,407
Yes.

749
01:00:56,187 --> 01:00:56,547
Thank you.

750
01:00:57,627 --> 01:00:58,308
Ma'am, welcome.

751
01:00:58,328 --> 01:00:59,908
Please state your name and address for the record.

752
01:01:00,897 --> 01:01:03,258
Hi there, Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

753
01:01:04,378 --> 01:01:16,641
I am the chair of the Medford Disability Commission and I have noticed that a number of things have come up that are relevant to the Disability Commission and that might be worth talking about.

754
01:01:17,141 --> 01:01:20,722
I'd like to invite any and all of you to come to our

755
01:01:22,022 --> 01:01:22,762
to our meetings.

756
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:31,325
If you have questions for us, obviously we only meet so often, so if you've got something that's really time-sensitive, of course you want to talk to Diane about it.

757
01:01:31,805 --> 01:01:40,007
But I just want to let you know that we do meet on the fourth Wednesday of the month, generally, from 5.30 to 7 o'clock.

758
01:01:40,027 --> 01:01:40,868
Our next meeting is what?

759
01:01:49,787 --> 01:02:02,417
Yep, so I'm gonna be on a boat then, so I don't actually remember when it is, but it's February 24th, and you are more than welcome, and of course, we'll be meeting in March as well.

760
01:02:02,897 --> 01:02:10,603
So if you've got questions, and we also are happy to put any of these topics on our agenda, we just need sufficient notice.

761
01:02:11,044 --> 01:02:18,970
So if you'd like to come in and talk in general about bus stops and what would be necessary to move bus stops,

762
01:02:19,758 --> 01:02:25,081
you know, what it's, what navigating the sidewalks in particular areas is like, that sort of thing.

763
01:02:25,481 --> 01:02:29,043
We would actually really love to have a dialogue about that, so please come join us.

764
01:02:29,263 --> 01:02:29,623
Thank you.

765
01:02:32,424 --> 01:02:32,805
Thank you.

766
01:02:32,825 --> 01:02:37,427
So on the motion of Councilor Caviello, as amended by Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

767
01:02:38,387 --> 01:02:39,088
Opposed?

768
01:02:39,568 --> 01:02:42,449
Motion carries.

769
01:02:42,469 --> 01:02:49,393
16-051, offered 50 motions already in this year, offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Medford

770
01:02:49,828 --> 01:02:57,090
vocational technical high school, explore offering evening courses to local residents for advanced manufacturing training.

771
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:07,753
There is an increased demand for skilled workers to fill these high-paying jobs where we already have the vocational school as a resource to prepare area residents.

772
01:03:07,813 --> 01:03:08,513
Counselor Marks.

773
01:03:09,293 --> 01:03:10,314
Thank you, Mr. President.

774
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:17,896
And I'd like to start by thanking Andrew Castanetti, who brought this issue to my attention as a

775
01:03:18,643 --> 01:03:37,127
former graduate of the Meffitt Vocational School, I'm always looking for ways to improving upon our vocational education within our community and also by bringing in other people to take advantage of the vocational school.

776
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:40,107
And this is a unique opportunity, Mr. President.

777
01:03:41,187 --> 01:03:44,028
Right now, the advanced manufacturing sector

778
01:03:44,746 --> 01:03:51,247
And the Commonwealth has, I guess, a boom in jobs and the need to fill these jobs.

779
01:03:52,008 --> 01:03:57,909
The average salary is about $75,000 for someone in this particular field.

780
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:04,390
And the city of Somerville just recently put together a course that they're offering.

781
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,371
They have two courses, one during the day and one at night.

782
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:11,672
And they're offering local residents over the age of 18 to

783
01:04:14,613 --> 01:04:17,113
and take courses in the advanced manufacturing training.

784
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:24,215
And this opens up a whole new networking for young adults that are 18, 19.

785
01:04:25,235 --> 01:04:26,915
Maybe they didn't end up going to college.

786
01:04:27,255 --> 01:04:28,435
Not everyone goes to college.

787
01:04:29,376 --> 01:04:35,417
They're stuck in a low-paid job, and they're looking for advancement, a way to create a career.

788
01:04:35,957 --> 01:04:43,858
And this really, I think, would be a win-win, not only to promote our vocational school, but also to allow area residents to attend courses

789
01:04:44,294 --> 01:04:46,756
at a local school that's accessible, Mr. President.

790
01:04:47,397 --> 01:04:49,919
And I think it would be a win-win for our residents.

791
01:04:50,399 --> 01:05:11,117
So I would just respectfully ask that the new director of the vocational school, who's doing yeoman's work in improving vocational education at the high school, and also bringing in new state-of-the-art technology equipment and courses at the vocational school, look into, Mr. President,

792
01:05:11,901 --> 01:05:33,346
the offering of this advanced manufacturing training to see if we have, first of all, the capability of doing it, and secondly, if we can offer courses to local residents that may have an interest in potentially looking at jobs in the 75 to 80 grand range for this particular trade, Mr. President.

793
01:05:33,386 --> 01:05:37,847
So, again, I want to thank Mr. Castanedi for bringing this to my attention.

794
01:05:38,328 --> 01:05:41,391
and ask that this be moved for approval, Mr. President.

795
01:05:41,431 --> 01:05:45,074
On the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, all those in favor?

796
01:05:45,734 --> 01:05:47,856
All those opposed?

797
01:05:47,876 --> 01:05:48,957
Motion carries.

798
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:50,878
16-052 offered by Vice President Hungo Kern.

799
01:05:51,379 --> 01:06:06,992
Be it resolved that the administration update the Medford City Council and keep us appraised of what changes have and will be made with regards to plans and procedures of the Medford Police Department and Medford Fire Department, such as

800
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:12,161
implementation of interdepartmental email for the fire department.

801
01:06:13,061 --> 01:06:13,941
Madam Vice President.

802
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:15,622
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

803
01:06:15,702 --> 01:06:16,822
I put this on the agenda.

804
01:06:17,142 --> 01:06:35,066
I think I've had requests for updates on changes, resolutions on the agenda for the last three or four weeks, and some things obviously have shown my frustration with regards to, but I think people are ready for change.

805
01:06:36,266 --> 01:06:44,252
in a number of ways, and a little anxious to get those changes and see what's gonna happen and find out what's gonna happen when.

806
01:06:44,272 --> 01:06:54,039
And this is just to piggyback with regards to last week, I brought up enforcement and how is it gonna change, how is it gonna increase and better our community.

807
01:06:54,699 --> 01:07:05,267
With regards to the Medford Police Department, Medford Fire Department, there have been resolves throughout the last many years with regards to changes and updates, whether it be building-wise,

808
01:07:05,942 --> 01:07:09,926
or interdepartment issues that go on.

809
01:07:10,406 --> 01:07:22,157
I know that I, as one counselor, have asked for the fire department to have interdepartmental email for almost two years now, since I found out there was no such thing, and I think it's kind of archaic.

810
01:07:23,157 --> 01:07:32,766
We've also questioned, you know, the female locker rooms, which we issue, which we know is in arbitration, and, you know, now the females are getting gym passes.

811
01:07:33,348 --> 01:07:40,291
We've gone in length with regards to the police department building and updates and the minor updates that were implemented.

812
01:07:40,511 --> 01:08:00,478
And I'd like to know from our administration what additional updates may be taking place, what the plan is, how are we going to make changes in a positive way, where are we going to spend our money, what are we going to do, what type of push will there be towards different enforcement throughout

813
01:08:00,929 --> 01:08:05,451
with the police department and, you know, how are those, you know, when are those changes going to take place?

814
01:08:05,471 --> 01:08:16,735
I think it's important and I think it's important for us to be updated with regards to, you know, minor things that, you know, the administration may seem to think are minor.

815
01:08:16,755 --> 01:08:28,780
I think the council should be apprised of it and I hope that we can, you know, get a communication from the mayor's office with regards to changes that have already been addressed and discussed and changes that maybe

816
01:08:29,635 --> 01:08:43,965
she would like to make in the future, so that we can get an idea of how we're moving forward and hopefully get a better understanding of the positive changes that we know need to be made and hopefully will be made.

817
01:08:45,165 --> 01:08:45,526
Very good.

818
01:08:45,586 --> 01:08:46,906
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

819
01:08:46,946 --> 01:08:55,292
You might notice in your packets, we've gotten the swiftest responses to most resolutions than I can remember on my tenure on the council.

820
01:08:57,695 --> 01:09:02,997
Mr. President, Councilor Longo did speak a little bit about the female locker room at the police department.

821
01:09:03,077 --> 01:09:07,379
It's my understanding that they're in the process right now of rectifying the situation.

822
01:09:07,479 --> 01:09:14,622
So it's been brought to my attention that a certain area has been vacated by a certain department and they've been moved to the new DPW building.

823
01:09:14,903 --> 01:09:22,086
And the administration is in the process of building out a female locker room for female officers, Mr. President.

824
01:09:22,106 --> 01:09:25,247
So I'd like to amend the paper and ask for an update on that item in particular.

825
01:09:25,907 --> 01:09:31,870
So on the motion for approval by Vice President Longo Kern as amended by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

826
01:09:32,791 --> 01:09:33,611
All those opposed?

827
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:35,352
Motion carries.

828
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:38,634
16-053 offered by Councilor Falco.

829
01:09:39,354 --> 01:09:47,458
Whereas the Medford City Council receives a weekly agenda and informational package each Friday to prepare for the weekly council meeting.

830
01:09:47,879 --> 01:09:54,222
Whereas each package contains various postings of upcoming public meetings throughout the city of Medford.

831
01:09:55,243 --> 01:10:06,012
be it resolved that the city administration require all boards and commissions to post meeting notifications and agenda items on the Medford City website.

832
01:10:06,473 --> 01:10:07,353
Counselor Falco.

833
01:10:07,593 --> 01:10:08,534
Thank you, Mr. President.

834
01:10:08,674 --> 01:10:17,382
Um, this, this resolution is about, uh, you know, government being open and more transparent to our residents in, and also just making government more accessible in general.

835
01:10:18,062 --> 01:10:22,366
Um, and I have to say when I first wrote this resolution last, uh, Thursday,

836
01:10:23,072 --> 01:10:24,453
and sent it to the city clerk.

837
01:10:24,513 --> 01:10:29,717
I did some research on the city website and I couldn't find any information on this.

838
01:10:30,298 --> 01:10:36,902
It's great every week we receive at least ten notices of open meetings and they're important.

839
01:10:37,103 --> 01:10:41,986
I think the public should be encouraged to attend and be involved.

840
01:10:42,547 --> 01:10:46,930
But last night as I was preparing for our meeting I went back on to the city website and I noticed

841
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:49,771
The city actually has a city calendar now.

842
01:10:50,271 --> 01:10:52,131
I'm not sure when it came online.

843
01:10:52,171 --> 01:10:57,833
I'm guessing over maybe the past couple of days, but when I first wrote the resolution, it wasn't there.

844
01:10:58,493 --> 01:11:02,274
Um, so, uh, but it's, it's, uh, I give the administration a lot of credit.

845
01:11:02,334 --> 01:11:03,935
I think it's heading in the right direction.

846
01:11:03,955 --> 01:11:05,195
Um, it's nice.

847
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:07,096
You click on the meetings, you get to, you get a link.

848
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:13,198
Um, but what I didn't, what I noticed is not all, um, meetings are posted.

849
01:11:13,258 --> 01:11:13,718
So that's why,

850
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:20,392
My resolution is basically to require that all of them, all of the, uh, board and commission meetings be posted.

851
01:11:20,412 --> 01:11:22,514
Uh, I think they should require an agenda.

852
01:11:22,994 --> 01:11:36,704
And if I could, um, amend the resolution to require that the minutes be, uh, also posted, uh, once the meeting is, uh, has been completed, it's important that, you know, we involve our citizens and they, you know, have the right to go to a website, go to the city website.

853
01:11:36,765 --> 01:11:41,408
And if they, they can see a list of meetings for the month, if they want to attend things, great.

854
01:11:41,468 --> 01:11:43,950
If they don't, at least when they, or if they can't at least,

855
01:11:44,408 --> 01:11:49,192
At the conclusion of the meeting, if the minutes are there, you know, they can actually see what happened during the meeting.

856
01:11:49,212 --> 01:11:50,112
And I think it's important.

857
01:11:50,353 --> 01:11:57,618
So, um, if I could amend that to, um, if we can amend that to, uh, require the minutes as well, uh, that'd be great.

858
01:11:57,738 --> 01:12:01,401
And, uh, I move for approval, a motion of approval as amended council night.

859
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,523
Um, thank you very much, Mr. President.

860
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:03,903
Thank you.

861
01:12:03,943 --> 01:12:05,344
Councilor Falco for this resolution.

862
01:12:05,384 --> 01:12:06,485
I think it's a great resolution.

863
01:12:07,540 --> 01:12:22,269
I'd like to amend it, Mr. President, to request that the administration begin scheduling their board and commission meetings outside of normal business hours so those individuals that are working for a living have the opportunity to appear after their work day to participate.

864
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:30,715
And I'd also ask that if and when possible, the meetings be televised or streamed.

865
01:12:34,485 --> 01:12:42,314
So on the twice amended motion, three times amended motion, twice by council night and by council.

866
01:12:42,354 --> 01:12:52,165
Well, while I'm on such a role, Mr. President, I have also filed a resolution under suspension of similar substance asking that the three week look ahead.

867
01:12:52,944 --> 01:12:55,584
schedule for the Craddock bridge be posted on the city's website as well.

868
01:12:55,665 --> 01:12:59,745
So I'd like to amend this paper to include that and I'll withdraw the paper under suspension.

869
01:12:59,925 --> 01:13:00,365
Very good.

870
01:13:00,465 --> 01:13:10,667
So on that motion, uh, and a second approval by council night as amended of the resolution of council, Falco made the first motion for approval.

871
01:13:11,087 --> 01:13:11,827
All those in favor.

872
01:13:12,387 --> 01:13:12,487
Aye.

873
01:13:12,967 --> 01:13:13,588
Opposed.

874
01:13:13,608 --> 01:13:15,288
Congratulations.

875
01:13:15,508 --> 01:13:18,408
Thank you.

876
01:13:18,428 --> 01:13:22,069
16 dash zero five seven offered by council care of yellow.

877
01:13:22,775 --> 01:13:41,323
be resolved that the Memphis City Council invite Rosemary Waltos, a library building specialist from the Massachusetts Libraries Board of Commissioners, along with members of our state delegation to a committee of the whole, to discuss funding opportunities for our public library, which is in need of major repairs and replacements.

878
01:13:41,763 --> 01:13:42,664
Councilor Caravello.

879
01:13:42,884 --> 01:13:43,644
Thank you, Mr. President.

880
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:52,608
Mr. President, it was only a few weeks ago that Barbara Kaye was here from the library, complaining how the roof was leaking and disrepair.

881
01:13:53,046 --> 01:14:00,690
Well, two weeks ago, I attended for the fourth time the convention at Sheridan for the city officials.

882
01:14:01,491 --> 01:14:09,776
And for the fourth year in a row, I've asked them if Medford, the library commission, if Medford has applied for any money.

883
01:14:10,536 --> 01:14:15,599
And finally this year, she said that some talks were in discussion.

884
01:14:16,179 --> 01:14:18,381
Well, it took us years to get this.

885
01:14:18,681 --> 01:14:20,342
But what I want to point out is,

886
01:14:21,571 --> 01:14:31,899
Over the last couple of years, Mr. President, over 100 libraries have been either built, reconstructed, under construction, or in the planning stage.

887
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:41,666
And just in our area, we've got Malden, Melrose, Arlington, Winchester, Cambridge, Everett, Woburn, Wakefield, Burlington, Lexington, Walton.

888
01:14:42,066 --> 01:14:48,551
These are all cities and towns, Mr. President, that have taken advantage of the money from the Library Building Commission.

889
01:14:49,232 --> 01:14:50,813
And I think it's time that

890
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:53,036
City of Medford get a chair.

891
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:55,817
She says there's money available.

892
01:14:57,097 --> 01:14:58,258
I spoke to her again today.

893
01:14:58,718 --> 01:15:16,165
She's more than willing to come down to the city to talk with the librarian, the trustees, and anybody we want to talk to, but she's willing to help us out, to do whatever's necessary to get the process started, to get us some funding, to get the library either rebuilt or reconstructed.

894
01:15:16,546 --> 01:15:19,727
So I would ask that this

895
01:15:20,394 --> 01:15:22,715
vote should be sent to the mayor for her immediate action.

896
01:15:23,236 --> 01:15:32,541
And Mr. President, while we're talking in the library, would it be possible that we can get a report back if the roof was ever repaired from a few weeks ago?

897
01:15:33,082 --> 01:15:35,503
So we'll take that as an amendment to your resolution as well.

898
01:15:35,743 --> 01:15:35,963
Yes.

899
01:15:36,304 --> 01:15:43,588
But again, over 100 cities and towns, Mr. President, have taken advantage of funding for their libraries.

900
01:15:44,228 --> 01:15:48,311
And in the last four years that I've been on this council, we have not gotten $1.

901
01:15:49,331 --> 01:15:49,912
I think it's a shame.

902
01:15:50,766 --> 01:15:52,706
Thank you for this important measure, councillor.

903
01:15:53,087 --> 01:15:59,528
And thank you for your participation on behalf of this body with the Mass Municipal Association.

904
01:15:59,808 --> 01:16:01,548
You've been a wealth of information for all of us.

905
01:16:02,088 --> 01:16:05,269
Chair recognizes Vice President Longo Kern.

906
01:16:05,329 --> 01:16:05,629
Thank you.

907
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:06,569
Thank you, President DeLaRusso.

908
01:16:06,609 --> 01:16:11,310
I want to thank Councillor Carviello for reaching out to the commissioner.

909
01:16:11,671 --> 01:16:13,251
I think that's a huge help.

910
01:16:13,371 --> 01:16:16,712
I know that the library needs a rehab.

911
01:16:16,892 --> 01:16:18,372
It needs a lot of work.

912
01:16:18,877 --> 01:16:26,342
We've been speaking about whether it be the bathrooms or the roof leaking, years and years, or underfunding the library.

913
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:33,266
So many people are interested to see this library updated, and I really hope it comes to fruition.

914
01:16:33,286 --> 01:16:46,935
I know that when I proposed that we hire a grant writer years back, one of my main reasons for it was because I read an article with regards to the grants that are out there for libraries in Massachusetts.

915
01:16:47,449 --> 01:17:01,375
And for us not to be taking part in trying to get these grants and trying to get state money, federal money to update our library, I think we're shortchanging something that could be so wonderful.

916
01:17:02,795 --> 01:17:06,177
I'm not sure about the roof, but I, too, would like to get an update on that.

917
01:17:06,757 --> 01:17:10,939
And I want to thank you again, Councilor Carviello, for reaching out to the board member.

918
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:13,960
And hopefully we can sit down and try to get some ideas.

919
01:17:14,685 --> 01:17:22,689
get the administration moving on some grants so that we can, whether we have to fund some ourself or not, I think we need to do it either way.

920
01:17:24,210 --> 01:17:24,590
Thank you.

921
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:28,392
Madam Vice President chair recognizes council.

922
01:17:28,652 --> 01:17:29,533
Thank you, Mr. President.

923
01:17:29,733 --> 01:17:33,014
I just want to thank councilor Carvello for bringing this up tonight.

924
01:17:33,034 --> 01:17:34,515
This is a very important resolution.

925
01:17:35,115 --> 01:17:38,697
Uh, the library is a very important asset to our community.

926
01:17:39,358 --> 01:17:42,099
Um, and I support the resolution completely.

927
01:17:42,785 --> 01:17:51,327
The question I had with regarding the roof is just because Councilor Cabrillo brought it up is he had asked if it's been fixed.

928
01:17:52,047 --> 01:17:56,068
I'd like to know not whether or not it was fixed, but what's the plan?

929
01:17:56,108 --> 01:17:59,168
I mean, as far as if it's not been fixed, what is the plan for the roof?

930
01:17:59,348 --> 01:18:05,930
I mean, with regard to, I mean, for example, I was in the library, I think about two weeks ago, I went to a, they had a trivia night.

931
01:18:05,950 --> 01:18:07,590
I think it was a friends and met the public library.

932
01:18:08,256 --> 01:18:09,036
And it was a great event.

933
01:18:09,496 --> 01:18:10,297
They raised a lot of money.

934
01:18:10,937 --> 01:18:11,817
And it was nice.

935
01:18:11,837 --> 01:18:14,098
It was the first time they had an event like that in the library.

936
01:18:14,118 --> 01:18:14,918
It was after hours.

937
01:18:15,538 --> 01:18:17,138
And open to the public.

938
01:18:17,978 --> 01:18:19,599
And we're sitting there having a great time.

939
01:18:19,639 --> 01:18:25,540
But as you look around, you see ceiling tiles that are not there, barrels collecting water.

940
01:18:26,281 --> 01:18:29,561
And we're still only maybe halfway through winter.

941
01:18:29,701 --> 01:18:35,683
So we need to find out exactly, if we could find out exactly from the administration, what is the plan with regard to the roof?

942
01:18:36,610 --> 01:18:45,772
be it further resolved by Councilor Falco or amended by Councilor Falco to get an answer from the administration for the long range plan for dealing with the roof.

943
01:18:46,793 --> 01:18:47,113
Thank you.

944
01:18:47,253 --> 01:18:47,653
Thank you.

945
01:18:48,253 --> 01:18:50,614
And the chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

946
01:18:51,534 --> 01:18:52,254
Thank you, Mr. President.

947
01:18:52,274 --> 01:18:53,675
I want to thank Councilor Cavielli.

948
01:18:53,695 --> 01:19:00,857
He's been a real advocate for the public library and the children of this community when it comes to the public library.

949
01:19:00,897 --> 01:19:03,177
So I want to thank him for his action on this.

950
01:19:04,017 --> 01:19:06,018
The reason why we didn't receive funding for the past,

951
01:19:06,539 --> 01:19:19,114
Four years was that the city of method during budgetary discussions didn't meet the state mandated threshold that's required for funding of a public library.

952
01:19:19,495 --> 01:19:23,159
So we therefore were ineligible to participate.

953
01:19:23,549 --> 01:19:24,790
and any state grants.

954
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:41,997
And we also, anyone that uses their library card, we lost membership in surrounding communities, the ability to go to another library in the network, the Minuteman network, and use their library because of our lack of funding our library.

955
01:19:42,637 --> 01:19:45,438
And I'm hoping to see that change, Mr. President.

956
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:49,060
I also just want to touch upon the roof.

957
01:19:49,584 --> 01:20:01,154
Because the report that we received had a various range from a couple of thousand dollars on a very temporary fix to I believe it was $125,000 or $130,000 for major roof repair and replacement throughout the entire library.

958
01:20:08,524 --> 01:20:26,593
So I think it's only incumbent upon the administration to at least update the council, because if the option three, which is I believe 130, 140,000 of repair is necessary, we're probably gonna be looking for a bond for the roof, and that would be approval by this council.

959
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:37,878
So I think it's important that the city administration at least give us a direction on what the plans are, and that roof has not been touched

960
01:20:38,436 --> 01:20:39,917
in 25 years.

961
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:42,297
That's the last time that roof was replaced.

962
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:54,842
And much of the pointing of the bricks, not only the roof, but the pointing around the bricks are accepting water, standing water from the roof itself, some of the flashing.

963
01:20:55,162 --> 01:20:58,504
So it's a lot of work that needs to be done on that roof, Mr. President.

964
01:20:58,864 --> 01:21:07,707
So I would ask that I thank Councilor Falco and Councilor Longo Kern for bringing that up and Councilor Caviello

965
01:21:08,167 --> 01:21:13,949
about the roof repair, Mr. President, that we get an immediate response on that.

966
01:21:14,449 --> 01:21:14,849
Very good.

967
01:21:15,469 --> 01:21:16,189
Councilor Caviello.

968
01:21:16,209 --> 01:21:32,994
Mr. President, this is the reason, if we can get this into the mayor's hands quickly, and we can act on it quickly, rather than us going off for a bond, let's see what the state can do for us, rather than burden our city taxpayers.

969
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:34,095
Excellent.

970
01:21:34,995 --> 01:21:35,295
Thank you.

971
01:21:35,883 --> 01:21:38,805
So on the motion of CAV Councilor Caviello as amended.

972
01:21:38,825 --> 01:21:39,845
Mr. President.

973
01:21:40,326 --> 01:21:40,526
Yes.

974
01:21:40,566 --> 01:21:41,326
Councilor Marks.

975
01:21:43,147 --> 01:21:57,095
Just if I could, I, I, I'm under the impression that, uh, the new administration, uh, was putting on a position that, uh, was in the mayor's office that was also a liaison between the mayor's office and the council.

976
01:21:58,276 --> 01:22:03,399
And if I'm not mistaken, that position, uh, I, I haven't seen anyone.

977
01:22:03,899 --> 01:22:05,260
I haven't had any outreach.

978
01:22:05,951 --> 01:22:12,593
Like, hey, look at me, I'm the new person that's going to be taking your request back and getting a quicker response to the mayor.

979
01:22:12,633 --> 01:22:13,893
And I haven't seen that yet.

980
01:22:13,933 --> 01:22:30,117
So maybe, Mr. President, maybe not to a resolution, but maybe if you could find out, you know, what the situation is with the liaison to the council, with the mayor, because that seemed to be a big point during the election.

981
01:22:31,998 --> 01:22:32,338
Thank you.

982
01:22:32,805 --> 01:22:34,566
On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

983
01:22:34,586 --> 01:22:35,146
Aye.

984
01:22:35,246 --> 01:22:36,207
All those opposed?

985
01:22:37,247 --> 01:22:38,228
Motion carries.

986
01:22:40,589 --> 01:22:41,290
Couple things.

987
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:43,211
Yes.

988
01:22:44,411 --> 01:22:46,312
I'm sorry?

989
01:22:46,873 --> 01:22:48,193
Rules to talk about an issue.

990
01:22:48,874 --> 01:22:49,234
Yes.

991
01:22:50,815 --> 01:23:00,460
Next week, six o'clock, committee of the whole to address our goals as counselors.

992
01:23:04,450 --> 01:23:15,378
The Committee of the Whole met this evening at 5.30 and upon resolution by Councilor Marks, it was reported favorably out of committee.

993
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,121
It was a long meeting.

994
01:23:18,821 --> 01:23:32,732
We addressed the issue of the Craddock Bridge construction, its impact on life in general in the neighborhood, its specific impact upon business there, pedestrian safety, traffic,

995
01:23:33,617 --> 01:23:37,740
congestion, buses, transportation in general.

996
01:23:39,422 --> 01:23:40,503
We had a good session.

997
01:23:42,524 --> 01:23:49,130
We had representatives from Massachusetts Department of Transportation, project manager for the program.

998
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:52,753
We had representatives from Zoppo Construction.

999
01:23:53,674 --> 01:23:58,157
The project manager was there for the construction progress, which I, on the sense of,

1000
01:23:59,607 --> 01:24:00,768
on the part of DOT.

1001
01:24:01,649 --> 01:24:16,702
We had department heads, Lauren DiLorenzo, Chief Sacco, Engineer Koudelakis, the acting commissioner of DPW, Brian Cairns, and I might be missing some, as well as all six councillors were present.

1002
01:24:17,523 --> 01:24:21,226
Seven citizens had the opportunity to speak and express their concerns.

1003
01:24:21,707 --> 01:24:22,327
We were very

1004
01:24:24,673 --> 01:24:25,694
How many counselors were there?

1005
01:24:25,714 --> 01:24:26,054
Seven.

1006
01:24:26,334 --> 01:24:26,474
Seven.

1007
01:24:26,494 --> 01:24:28,575
Counselors and seven citizens spoke.

1008
01:24:28,595 --> 01:24:29,015
Were you there?

1009
01:24:29,135 --> 01:24:29,655
I was there.

1010
01:24:29,715 --> 01:24:30,956
I sat at the head of the table.

1011
01:24:31,236 --> 01:24:31,596
Okay.

1012
01:24:31,696 --> 01:24:31,916
Yes.

1013
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:32,997
Yes.

1014
01:24:34,677 --> 01:24:41,040
And I think the clerk is going to read off, if he would, the committee report.

1015
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:44,621
You had some recommendations from the committee.

1016
01:24:47,498 --> 01:24:54,783
Diane McLeod to do an ADA audit of the project.

1017
01:24:55,824 --> 01:25:05,210
And the administration to designate a contact person with the project.

1018
01:25:08,472 --> 01:25:16,298
And to have an update, and to have updates from MassDOT in a week or two.

1019
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,283
on the issues that were discussed during the meeting.

1020
01:25:20,303 --> 01:25:20,723
Very good.

1021
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:25,826
And was that, did that get your, Madam Vice President had those?

1022
01:25:26,547 --> 01:25:31,209
Just, if we could just make clear that the contact person be somebody from City Hall.

1023
01:25:33,171 --> 01:25:33,831
Just make that clear.

1024
01:25:33,851 --> 01:25:38,074
Maybe one of the three that have already been dealing with MassDOT as of recent.

1025
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:43,157
All right.

1026
01:25:44,027 --> 01:25:47,821
And that we do get an update within the next week or two with regards to.

1027
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:55,952
The many issues we discussed and recommendations and requests, okay.

1028
01:25:56,193 --> 01:26:01,155
So we're going to then get a report back and then reconvene for an update.

1029
01:26:01,835 --> 01:26:03,296
So on the motion, President.

1030
01:26:04,257 --> 01:26:06,038
Councilor Marks, if you would, please, yes.

1031
01:26:06,198 --> 01:26:07,178
Thank you, Mr. President.

1032
01:26:07,318 --> 01:26:09,399
And I agree with all my colleagues.

1033
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:17,243
I think we all felt it was necessary to have a contact person, a clerk of the work, whatever you want to call them, to be responsible.

1034
01:26:19,531 --> 01:26:25,192
At one point in this city, we had a person by the name of Jack Buckley, who was a project manager.

1035
01:26:26,192 --> 01:26:36,374
And Jack Buckley was responsible for the oversight of the building of the new schools, which was probably the largest endeavor in this city's history.

1036
01:26:36,734 --> 01:26:40,355
He was responsible for the refurbishing of the fire stations.

1037
01:26:40,735 --> 01:26:42,056
He was responsible for

1038
01:26:44,837 --> 01:26:48,699
oversight of a number of large projects happening in the community.

1039
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:51,161
And he retired recently.

1040
01:26:51,781 --> 01:26:56,684
And I think one thing that's lacking in this community, Mr. President, is that type of oversight.

1041
01:26:57,124 --> 01:27:10,351
Jack had great expertise on building trades, how to deal with manufacturers, how to make sure that these particular companies were compliant with contract.

1042
01:27:10,431 --> 01:27:13,773
And, you know, he had a great depth of knowledge.

1043
01:27:14,431 --> 01:27:24,341
And you can rest assured if you ask him a question on anything regarding construction or what's taking place, time frames, he was always there to answer the question.

1044
01:27:24,881 --> 01:27:28,965
And I really believe someone in that capacity is needed, Mr. President.

1045
01:27:29,345 --> 01:27:36,272
Because what we heard tonight from the administration was the question was asked, who's the point person on this project?

1046
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:38,474
I don't know if it was, I think it was Councilor Knight that asked that.

1047
01:27:39,105 --> 01:27:42,588
And we were told, well, Lawrence said, I can answer questions.

1048
01:27:43,249 --> 01:27:46,932
The city engineer, Cassandra Koudelaitis, said, I can answer questions.

1049
01:27:47,432 --> 01:27:49,854
Or you can send them to Paul Mulkey.

1050
01:27:49,874 --> 01:27:51,155
He may be able to answer questions.

1051
01:27:52,336 --> 01:28:02,484
I think when we get back to accountability, get back to having a central depository where you know who to call, I think it's very important, Mr. President.

1052
01:28:02,504 --> 01:28:06,708
And I would just like to mention that to the city administration,

1053
01:28:07,557 --> 01:28:11,643
The project manager was there for a number of years for a reason, and it was successful.

1054
01:28:11,663 --> 01:28:16,771
In my opinion, it was very successful, maybe based on the person that we had in that position.

1055
01:28:17,150 --> 01:28:27,139
But it was a successful position in moving projects forward and alerting residents on the ongoing of what's happening in the community.

1056
01:28:27,699 --> 01:28:31,082
And I do want to point that out, Mr. President.

1057
01:28:31,382 --> 01:28:32,123
Thank you, Councilman.

1058
01:28:32,143 --> 01:28:42,612
I'd like to point out that that project person was for projects that were funded by the city as part of bonding processes and all of that.

1059
01:28:44,093 --> 01:28:50,197
I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that this is a state project that we're dealing with and not a municipal one.

1060
01:28:50,898 --> 01:28:55,741
But, Mr. President, with all due respect, it's on a Meffitt road.

1061
01:28:56,221 --> 01:28:57,542
It's affecting Meffitt business.

1062
01:28:57,882 --> 01:28:59,283
It's affecting Meffitt pedestrian.

1063
01:28:59,603 --> 01:29:00,924
It's affecting Meffitt traffic.

1064
01:29:01,304 --> 01:29:09,529
For us not to have a clerk of the work or a project manager, whether it's state or city, makes no sense.

1065
01:29:10,230 --> 01:29:11,371
It has no bearing at all.

1066
01:29:11,651 --> 01:29:13,612
The project is a Meffitt project.

1067
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:15,534
I'm in disagreement with you.

1068
01:29:15,815 --> 01:29:19,948
I know, but I think you were trying to point out that, uh, that was only for city projects.

1069
01:29:20,481 --> 01:29:25,183
And even with the FAST-14 project, the bridge repair, that was a state project.

1070
01:29:25,203 --> 01:29:31,725
It was the largest bridge repair in this state's history that went through this city, the heart of this city.

1071
01:29:32,105 --> 01:29:36,487
And at the time, we had someone on board, and that was Jack Buckley, Mr. President.

1072
01:29:36,767 --> 01:29:44,650
We had someone on board that was there to make sure that the I's were dotted and the T's were crossed, and that all contractual language was adhered to.

1073
01:29:45,092 --> 01:29:50,234
and to make sure that resident, business owner, and everyone's questions were addressed.

1074
01:29:50,934 --> 01:29:52,835
So, you know, I would disagree with you.

1075
01:29:52,855 --> 01:30:06,480
I think that position was for any project in the community, whether it was bonded by our city or not, to ensure that the rules and regulations and that this city is heard when issues need to be addressed, Mr. President.

1076
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:07,901
Councilor Knight.

1077
01:30:08,521 --> 01:30:09,841
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1078
01:30:09,881 --> 01:30:13,063
And Councilor Marks, I think everything you said is 100% accurate.

1079
01:30:14,675 --> 01:30:22,541
There's definitely a need for someone to be the so-called clerk of the work, someone that has a set of eyes on these construction projects that are going on in our community.

1080
01:30:23,362 --> 01:30:34,070
As these private contractors come in and these private utility companies come in and tear up our streets and then say they'll be back in a year to fix it, we need to make sure that there's someone there saying, hey, remember nine months ago when you said you were going to be back?

1081
01:30:34,371 --> 01:30:35,271
Well, the nine months are up.

1082
01:30:35,331 --> 01:30:37,473
It's time to start digging in the ground and fixing the street.

1083
01:30:38,586 --> 01:30:47,130
I really support the position of the office of the project manager and the position of a project manager or the so-called clerk of the works, Mr. President, for the simple reason that it provides accountability.

1084
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:55,593
And we know if someone's not doing the job because we can see the ramifications and the aftereffects when the ground gets opened up and gets put back together.

1085
01:30:55,633 --> 01:30:56,293
We know who to go to.

1086
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:57,134
We know who to talk to.

1087
01:30:57,854 --> 01:31:06,237
So, you know, I certainly echo Councillor Mack's sentiments and statement when he says that he'd like to see a project manager rehired here at the city level.

1088
01:31:08,691 --> 01:31:10,612
was an unbelievable asset to this community.

1089
01:31:11,013 --> 01:31:16,436
I'm not just saying that because his backyard is right around the corner from my parents' backyard.

1090
01:31:16,776 --> 01:31:19,478
He did a great job, and he did great work.

1091
01:31:19,538 --> 01:31:33,868
And if you go down the list and you look at the projects that he oversaw, whether it was the pool, or the science labs, or the DPW yard, or the renovations at the firehouse, he certainly was someone that made sure that we got our bang for our buck, Mr. President.

1092
01:31:33,888 --> 01:31:35,689
And I think we need someone in that capacity

1093
01:31:36,256 --> 01:31:36,797
to continue.

1094
01:31:36,857 --> 01:31:40,819
So I certainly support Councilor Mark's position wholeheartedly and I move for approval on the paper.

1095
01:31:41,240 --> 01:31:45,843
So on the motion for the approval of the committee report by Councilor Marks.

1096
01:31:49,386 --> 01:31:49,986
Absolutely.

1097
01:31:50,386 --> 01:31:51,167
All those in favor?

1098
01:31:52,067 --> 01:31:52,768
All those opposed?

1099
01:31:54,049 --> 01:31:56,150
Congratulations.

1100
01:31:56,531 --> 01:31:59,733
On the motion of Councilor Falco for suspension of the rules.

1101
01:32:00,113 --> 01:32:00,854
All those in favor?

1102
01:32:01,514 --> 01:32:02,255
All those opposed?

1103
01:32:03,115 --> 01:32:04,036
Motion carries.

1104
01:32:04,696 --> 01:32:05,377
Councilor Falco.

1105
01:32:05,601 --> 01:32:06,502
Thank you, Mr. President.

1106
01:32:06,522 --> 01:32:15,267
I received a phone call Saturday afternoon about 4.30 from Father Ed, from Ed Dowdy from St.

1107
01:32:15,307 --> 01:32:16,707
Joe's, Joseph's.

1108
01:32:16,888 --> 01:32:22,991
And he called to tell me that as he was welcoming parishioners into the 4 o'clock mass at St.

1109
01:32:23,031 --> 01:32:26,573
Joe's, parishioners were getting tickets from Republic Parking.

1110
01:32:27,574 --> 01:32:30,575
And I find this incredibly frustrating that after one year,

1111
01:32:31,895 --> 01:32:33,696
that is not part of the contract.

1112
01:32:33,736 --> 01:32:38,477
And they shouldn't be ticketing during mass from what I know of the contract.

1113
01:32:39,057 --> 01:32:45,319
And I find it very frustrating that after one year, they're still ticketing people when they shouldn't.

1114
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:49,581
And I'd like some sort of response back from Republic Parking.

1115
01:32:49,601 --> 01:32:52,702
If we could get something in writing as to why this happened.

1116
01:32:53,462 --> 01:33:00,464
Father Ed did go on to tell me that he actually approached the person writing the tickets and told them, you know, you shouldn't be doing this.

1117
01:33:01,082 --> 01:33:04,123
And at no point in the time did the person stop.

1118
01:33:04,143 --> 01:33:05,344
They didn't even call the office.

1119
01:33:05,504 --> 01:33:08,565
You figured they would call the office and check just to get some clarification.

1120
01:33:09,205 --> 01:33:13,407
So if we could get some sort of a response from Republic Parking to find out why it happened.

1121
01:33:13,927 --> 01:33:16,188
I'm not sure if it's a case, if it's a new employee or not.

1122
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:27,022
In a case like that, there should be some sort of backup for their employees to call the office to find out whether or not they're doing the right thing or following policy.

1123
01:33:27,042 --> 01:33:31,362
So if we could get some sort of response from Republic Parking, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1124
01:33:31,382 --> 01:33:31,702
Thank you.

1125
01:33:31,802 --> 01:33:32,543
Councilor Caviello.

1126
01:33:32,863 --> 01:33:33,563
Thank you, Mr. President.

1127
01:33:33,943 --> 01:33:41,264
This goes back to my request about three or four weeks ago to sit down with Republic and discuss their policies and practices.

1128
01:33:42,484 --> 01:33:45,845
And again, no response to see where we're going with this.

1129
01:33:47,024 --> 01:33:50,745
You know, to talk about things that have been done wrong in the past and how to make them better going forward.

1130
01:33:51,185 --> 01:33:52,506
I mean, you know, he talked about that.

1131
01:33:53,466 --> 01:33:57,507
A few weeks ago, I had a similar problem with a Republic person.

1132
01:33:57,968 --> 01:34:03,029
He was harassing a handicapped person for not moving his car fast enough.

1133
01:34:03,949 --> 01:34:11,192
Granted, the guy was in violation, parking in violation, and the gentleman who he was harassing was a triple amputee.

1134
01:34:11,232 --> 01:34:14,293
And I explained to the parking person that

1135
01:34:15,987 --> 01:34:23,751
The gentleman isn't able to walk that fast, and his response to me was, I don't really care, for which I took exception.

1136
01:34:24,251 --> 01:34:31,175
And I did report him to Dan Nash at the company, but I've since never heard anything back about that.

1137
01:34:31,215 --> 01:34:37,298
But I felt that the gentleman, I told Dan, I felt that the gentleman was doing an apology for the rude treatment that he was given.

1138
01:34:38,218 --> 01:34:43,121
And I say, if I didn't see it for myself, it wasn't secondhand, it was something I saw.

1139
01:34:43,141 --> 01:34:45,062
But again, this was a motion I asked for.

1140
01:34:45,521 --> 01:34:49,483
sit down to discuss their policies going forward, Mr. President.

1141
01:34:51,164 --> 01:34:56,486
On the motion for approval on Councilor Falco as amended by Councilor Caviello.

1142
01:34:57,007 --> 01:34:58,367
Councilor London-Curran.

1143
01:34:58,607 --> 01:34:58,968
Thank you.

1144
01:34:58,988 --> 01:35:07,212
And I just would like to ask if I could further amend this because I received an email this week with regards to a business owner of a daycare.

1145
01:35:08,432 --> 01:35:10,133
Another portion of

1146
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:18,866
I'm not sure if it's in the contract or something they were going to adhere to, is the leniency during pick up and drop off for daycares and schools in the city of Medford.

1147
01:35:18,966 --> 01:35:24,330
And from what I understand, over the last couple weeks, that leniency is no more.

1148
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:34,897
And they're now ticketing, Republic Parking is now ticketing people who are going in three minutes to drop off somebody, their child at a daycare or at a school.

1149
01:35:35,422 --> 01:35:37,103
And that's something we were promised.

1150
01:35:37,123 --> 01:35:46,269
This council specifically asked for leniency in schools and we were promised that there would be leniency before, during the drop off and during the pickup.

1151
01:35:46,689 --> 01:35:55,575
So I'm not sure if this in mass coincides with the fact that revenues, the big article came out that revenues are short for public parking.

1152
01:35:56,075 --> 01:36:01,179
But just because your revenues are short doesn't mean you can violate the rules, violate your promises.

1153
01:36:02,087 --> 01:36:04,548
I would just like to ask for public parking that as well.

1154
01:36:05,069 --> 01:36:07,170
This take care, I believe, is on Riverside Ave.

1155
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:11,532
But I'm not sure if it's going on in other locations.

1156
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:19,136
But I'm assuming from what I've been hearing, there's some ticketing that should not be happening during certain times in certain places.

1157
01:36:19,716 --> 01:36:21,437
And that's a shame.

1158
01:36:22,117 --> 01:36:25,419
As amended by Vice President Largo-Kern, Council night.

1159
01:36:26,312 --> 01:36:32,396
Mr. President, I noticed in our packet that we had not received an update relative to the issues that we discussed on Marion Street.

1160
01:36:32,957 --> 01:36:42,863
And I was hoping we could amend this paper to ask for a update on that situation as well, relative to the resident annual parking on Marion Street that we discussed last week.

1161
01:36:43,384 --> 01:36:44,624
As amended by Councilor Knight.

1162
01:36:44,724 --> 01:36:49,548
On the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, as seconded by Councilor Caviello, and amended as noted.

1163
01:36:49,908 --> 01:36:50,608
All those in favor?

1164
01:36:51,229 --> 01:36:53,790
Aye.

1165
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:54,371
Yes, Councilor.

1166
01:36:55,770 --> 01:36:57,451
While we're on to suspension, Councilor Caviello.

1167
01:36:57,471 --> 01:37:09,719
Mr. President, in our package this evening, I made a resolution back in January 12, 16206, in regards to the pay phones that are scattered around the city.

1168
01:37:09,739 --> 01:37:11,861
And we got a response back this evening.

1169
01:37:11,881 --> 01:37:19,866
And I'm questioning the part of it that says, I have contacted Verizon and awaiting a response.

1170
01:37:20,387 --> 01:37:25,390
The pedestal of 492 High Street is located on private property, and I request that Verizon

1171
01:37:25,955 --> 01:37:30,257
Mr. President, all this is a pedestal with no phone there.

1172
01:37:30,998 --> 01:37:32,939
I mean, it just looks, it's unsightly.

1173
01:37:33,439 --> 01:37:39,362
And then it goes on to say the pay phones at CVS and 43 Salem Street are active.

1174
01:37:39,842 --> 01:37:46,445
Well, unless these people are very good, there's no, there's no thing to call on.

1175
01:37:47,266 --> 01:37:49,967
I mean, you know, there's no receiver, there's no thing there.

1176
01:37:50,007 --> 01:37:52,448
So I don't know how they're active.

1177
01:37:52,468 --> 01:37:54,990
So if I, if you could send this back to,

1178
01:37:58,565 --> 01:38:01,306
The superintendent of wires, I'm looking for clarification.

1179
01:38:01,866 --> 01:38:13,330
The motion of Councilor Caravello to send back for clarification to the superintendent of wires the recent response received.

1180
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:14,690
All those in favor?

1181
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:17,611
All those opposed?

1182
01:38:18,271 --> 01:38:22,193
Paper in the hands of the clerk offered by Councilor Marks be resolved that the heavy trucking

1183
01:38:23,876 --> 01:38:25,417
on Spring Street be discussed?

1184
01:38:25,498 --> 01:38:26,098
Councilor Marks.

1185
01:38:26,658 --> 01:38:27,479
Thank you, Mr. President.

1186
01:38:27,519 --> 01:38:32,023
As we're all aware, there's a no heavy trucking ban on Spring Street.

1187
01:38:32,824 --> 01:38:45,695
And I think it was about a year and a half, two years ago, a number of residents came before this council concerned that the city was not enforcing enough the trucks that are used in Spring Street, the heavy trucks.

1188
01:38:46,475 --> 01:38:52,020
And for a period of time, the problem was solved.

1189
01:38:52,520 --> 01:39:06,023
And now it's rearing its ugly head again that Spring Street is being used as a cut-through for Penske Truck, Budweiser, and a number of other businesses in the area, Mr. President.

1190
01:39:07,123 --> 01:39:12,324
And for whatever reason, there's been a lack of enforcement by our police department.

1191
01:39:13,064 --> 01:39:18,105
Back, I think it was a year and a half ago, I offered a resolution to create a trucking team.

1192
01:39:18,925 --> 01:39:21,666
Many surrounding police departments have a trucking team.

1193
01:39:22,482 --> 01:39:25,644
And it wasn't just to put on additional police officers.

1194
01:39:26,144 --> 01:39:34,209
It was to address an issue of 18 wheelers traversing our roads, Mr. President, and at no fear of ever getting pulled over.

1195
01:39:34,229 --> 01:39:44,415
It really is, from what I've been told by members of the police department, it's a particular training to pull these 18 wheelers over.

1196
01:39:44,676 --> 01:39:47,117
You have to have the ability to be able to look at the log.

1197
01:39:47,417 --> 01:39:51,400
You got to have the ability to be able to read markings on the side of the truck, the type of

1198
01:39:52,582 --> 01:39:58,546
liquids they may be carrying, the type of goods they may be carrying, the weight of the truck and so forth.

1199
01:39:59,106 --> 01:40:04,529
And you have to have ample training and you have to have the equipment to pull these trucks over.

1200
01:40:05,190 --> 01:40:12,814
And many of our police officers that I've spoken to aren't willing to pull these trucks over because they're not trained and not equipped.

1201
01:40:13,555 --> 01:40:15,276
And that was the statement I got from them.

1202
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:19,018
So I think after a while these truckers know

1203
01:40:19,535 --> 01:40:20,055
Hey, you know what?

1204
01:40:20,095 --> 01:40:21,856
Don't go through Cambridge, Somerville.

1205
01:40:21,876 --> 01:40:23,477
Go through Meffitt.

1206
01:40:23,717 --> 01:40:24,597
They won't pull you over.

1207
01:40:25,257 --> 01:40:29,539
And I think it's posing a problem in our community.

1208
01:40:30,199 --> 01:40:36,862
And again, I would ask for enforcement, Mr. President, of the heavy trucking on Spring Street.

1209
01:40:37,983 --> 01:40:40,864
We all know what happens after a period of time with heavy trucking.

1210
01:40:41,324 --> 01:40:43,745
It creates the waves in the road.

1211
01:40:44,565 --> 01:40:45,366
It really does.

1212
01:40:45,826 --> 01:40:48,967
And we saw that firsthand on Spring Street in particular.

1213
01:40:49,367 --> 01:40:58,831
I'm not sure if it was poor quality of tar that was put down or whatever it might have been, but it created a lot of ripples throughout the whole road, and that was from the heavy trucking.

1214
01:40:59,191 --> 01:41:08,214
So I would ask increased enforcement on Spring Street, and I would also ask the Chief of Police to once again look at the creation of a truck team.

1215
01:41:09,475 --> 01:41:15,277
I was told when you issue a ticket to an 18-wheeler, it could be upwards of $1,200 for a ticket.

1216
01:41:17,811 --> 01:41:22,454
So the truck unit would pay for itself doing the basic enforcement.

1217
01:41:22,674 --> 01:41:27,877
And don't forget, we have major truck routes running through our community, through our neighborhoods.

1218
01:41:28,618 --> 01:41:38,283
We saw what happened at Centilli Circle in Everett back some 10 years ago when an 18-wheeler went off and went into the site of elderly housing over there.

1219
01:41:39,064 --> 01:41:45,728
These are trucks speeding through our community and so forth, and it really poses a public safety concern.

1220
01:41:45,748 --> 01:41:47,489
So I would ask that the chief look at

1221
01:41:47,836 --> 01:41:49,257
the truck unit, Mr. President.

1222
01:41:49,917 --> 01:41:56,761
And if I could just put in a plug while I'm speaking, we also don't have police patrol on the Mystic River.

1223
01:41:57,761 --> 01:42:01,263
And people might say, oh, the Mystic River, you can walk over the Mystic River.

1224
01:42:01,784 --> 01:42:02,764
No, that's not the case.

1225
01:42:03,245 --> 01:42:07,807
We have Meffitt High School, our young students, rowing on the Mystic River.

1226
01:42:08,307 --> 01:42:14,671
And we don't have, other than the fire department, which does have a way of getting onto the Mystic River,

1227
01:42:15,521 --> 01:42:17,782
We don't have any patrol of the Mystic River at all.

1228
01:42:18,143 --> 01:42:21,745
We would have to wait for state police to come through the locks in Boston.

1229
01:42:22,065 --> 01:42:24,606
God forbid there was an accident on the Mystic River.

1230
01:42:25,527 --> 01:42:26,708
We've had tournaments there.

1231
01:42:26,988 --> 01:42:33,872
Just recently, the Meffitt Bowl Club had a tournament, a national tournament, actually, on the Mystic River.

1232
01:42:34,432 --> 01:42:43,578
And I think, really, as a city, we fall short of the mark when it comes to protecting our riverway and also protecting against these 18-wheelers

1233
01:42:45,251 --> 01:42:50,694
that are coming through our community without any fear of ever getting a ticket, Mr. President.

1234
01:42:51,014 --> 01:42:55,657
So I would offer those two, as well as the enforcement on Spring Street for the heavy trucking.

1235
01:42:56,037 --> 01:42:58,158
So the motion of Councilor Marks as amended.

1236
01:42:58,198 --> 01:42:58,778
Councilor Caviello.

1237
01:42:59,058 --> 01:42:59,739
Thank you, Mr. President.

1238
01:42:59,819 --> 01:43:02,420
I commend Councilor Marks on bringing this forward.

1239
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:07,442
In the meantime, if the chief could contact the state police truck team.

1240
01:43:08,203 --> 01:43:14,246
I see them occasionally on Mystic Avenue pulling trucks over, occasionally on the parkway, but they're not anywhere else.

1241
01:43:14,822 --> 01:43:17,923
And he's right, when these trucks get pulled over, it's a pretty hefty fine.

1242
01:43:18,563 --> 01:43:27,504
So if he could contact the state police or the DOT truck team to maybe increase its presence in the Medford area, it would be greatly helped.

1243
01:43:27,584 --> 01:43:33,205
And on the other thing you brought up, we have a position of harbormaster in the city.

1244
01:43:34,586 --> 01:43:37,046
What does the harbormaster do?

1245
01:43:37,506 --> 01:43:41,227
Is that something that should be looked upon as that safety?

1246
01:43:41,267 --> 01:43:42,647
I mean, who is the harbormaster?

1247
01:43:43,686 --> 01:43:44,887
That's my other question.

1248
01:43:46,047 --> 01:43:46,688
It's Mr. Burns.

1249
01:43:46,708 --> 01:43:53,452
I understand Mr. Burns is maybe a little, he's an older gentleman.

1250
01:43:54,332 --> 01:43:57,874
And I don't think we own a boat either for the harbormaster.

1251
01:43:58,715 --> 01:44:07,900
So maybe something, maybe having a harbormaster that's a little more up with the times might be something for the new administration to look at.

1252
01:44:10,065 --> 01:44:22,588
Mr. President, I ask to amend the paper to request that the Chief of Police provide us with the number of complaints that they received in the past 12 months relative to heavy trucking on residential roadways, as well as the number of citations issued, Mr. President.

1253
01:44:23,108 --> 01:44:26,469
On the motion of Councilor Marks, as amended.

1254
01:44:26,509 --> 01:44:27,449
All those in favor?

1255
01:44:28,190 --> 01:44:28,850
All those opposed?

1256
01:44:30,123 --> 01:44:33,208
The records of the previous week's meeting were passed to Councilor Marks.

1257
01:44:33,649 --> 01:44:35,572
Mr. Councilor, how did you find those records?

1258
01:44:36,113 --> 01:44:37,636
I reviewed the records, Mr. President.

1259
01:44:37,656 --> 01:44:39,198
I find them to be in order and move approval.

1260
01:44:39,379 --> 01:44:42,624
On the motion for approval of the previous records by Councilor Marks.

1261
01:44:42,684 --> 01:44:43,385
All those in favor?

1262
01:44:43,766 --> 01:44:44,467
All those opposed?

1263
01:44:44,547 --> 01:44:45,148
Motion carries.

1264
01:44:45,749 --> 01:44:47,913
On the motion of Councilor Caviello for adjournment.

1265
01:44:47,933 --> 01:44:48,694
All those in favor?

1266
01:44:49,536 --> 01:44:50,117
All those opposed?

1267
01:44:50,197 --> 01:44:50,898
Meeting adjourned.
