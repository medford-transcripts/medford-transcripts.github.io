Hello, we are very pleased to have this opportunity to introduce you to your new pay-by-plate parking kiosk.

2
00:00:15,393 --> 00:00:21,457
The new pay-by-plate kiosk is solar powered, accepts many forms of payment, and is very easy to use.

3
00:00:21,977 --> 00:00:25,540
Now I'd like to demonstrate just how easy it is to make a parking payment.

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,823
With this type of parking system, it's important to remember your license number.

5
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:35,406
For me, it's easy to use my smartphone and take a picture of my license plate, then I always have it on hand.

6
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:41,510
To begin your parking transaction, hit the start button on the keypad to wake up the display screen.

7
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:44,993
Next, you are prompted to enter your license plate number.

8
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:53,440
Once you're finished entering your plate number, push the green key on the keypad to confirm.

9
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,222
Now you are asked to insert your payment.

10
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:00,345
The kiosks take credit and debit cards as well as coins.

11
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:04,188
The appointed slots are labeled to help specify where to pay.

12
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:09,413
To pay with coins, just insert the coins, one at a time, into the coin slot.

13
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:16,982
The display screen will show you the dollar amount you have inserted and the time your parking will expire.

14
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:26,008
Press the red button if you need to start over and your coins will be returned to you in the coin bowl area.

15
00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:31,892
For credit cards, just insert the card face up with the card logo facing to the left.

16
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,513
Then remove the card.

17
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:40,078
Select the amount of time you wish to purchase by pressing the blue buttons shown on the keypad.

18
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:44,898
Press the red cancel button if you need to start over.

19
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:52,519
When you have selected the amount of time you wish to purchase, press the green button and your receipt will print out.

20
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,781
Take your receipt for your own records.

21
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:57,122
There is no need to display it in your vehicle.

22
00:01:57,723 --> 00:02:02,587
Your license plate information is communicated to parking enforcement officers wirelessly.

23
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:10,774
Extremely easy to operate, your new pay-by-plate parking kiosk will make everyone's parking experience so much more convenient.

24
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:15,478
Thank you for taking the time to watch this brief instructional video and happy parking.
