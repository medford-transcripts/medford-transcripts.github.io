5
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:35,406
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's easy to use my smartphone and take a picture of my license plate, then I always have it on hand.

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you are asked to insert your payment.

10
00:00:57,003 --> 00:01:00,345
[SPEAKER_00]: The kiosks take credit and debit cards as well as coins.

11
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:04,188
[SPEAKER_00]: The appointed slots are labeled to help specify where to pay.

12
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:09,413
[SPEAKER_00]: To pay with coins, just insert the coins, one at a time, into the coin slot.

13
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:16,982
[SPEAKER_00]: The display screen will show you the dollar amount you have inserted and the time your parking will expire.

14
00:01:17,622 --> 00:01:26,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Press the red button if you need to start over and your coins will be returned to you in the coin bowl area.

00:01:26,408 --> 00:01:31,892

16
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,513

20
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your receipt for your own records.

21
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:57,122
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no need to display it in your vehicle.

22
00:01:57,723 --> 00:02:02,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Your license plate information is communicated to parking enforcement officers wirelessly.

23
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:10,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremely easy to operate, your new pay-by-plate parking kiosk will make everyone's parking experience so much more convenient.
