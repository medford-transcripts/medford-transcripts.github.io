26
00:00:50,912 --> 00:01:07,781
[SPEAKER_09]: If she could come up, as we all know, Judy is instrumental in putting together the Jingle Bell Festival that we have right here in City Hall Chambers during the winter season, and also the Jingle Bell Fun Run, which raises money for many charities in our community, including the Buddy Copeland Center.

27
00:01:08,141 --> 00:01:11,183
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd ask Judy to come up and say a few words and present some trophies.

28
00:01:11,803 --> 00:01:12,043
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

29
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:12,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

30
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,684
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

31
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:17,506
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I want to say a thank you to all the schools who participated

32
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,744
[SPEAKER_11]: in making this the success that it has been.

33
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:21,865
[SPEAKER_11]: This is our third year.

34
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:24,768
[SPEAKER_11]: This year we will be giving a total of almost $23,000 to the schools.

35
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:35,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Want to get insurance in real estate pays for the race.

36
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:40,495
[SPEAKER_11]: We buy all the t-shirts and we pay for the timing and we pay all the expenses.

37
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:49,061
[SPEAKER_11]: So every penny that is raised by all the students and parents and PTOs or whatever goes 100% directly back to the schools.

38
00:01:49,982 --> 00:01:51,463
[SPEAKER_11]: So first year we raised $12,000.

39
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:52,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Last year we raised $15,000.

40
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:53,524
[SPEAKER_11]: And this year we raised $23,000.

41
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:55,346
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully we'll double it again.

42
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:06,727
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to acknowledge a couple of people.

43
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:17,255
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to first acknowledge Maury Carroll, who did a breakfast after the race, and he did a night before the race, and donated half of the proceeds, and he donated $1,400 to us.

44
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:20,118
[SPEAKER_11]: So, which was a huge boost in our bottom line.

45
00:02:20,538 --> 00:02:21,559
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I'd like to thank him.

46
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,461
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to thank Elaine Rocha.

47
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:33,363
[SPEAKER_11]: our secretarial, and all of that, because her ability is above and beyond what I certainly am capable of doing.

48
00:02:33,843 --> 00:02:38,304
[SPEAKER_11]: And she, if you don't give her the money, your name does not go on anything.

49
00:02:38,884 --> 00:02:40,625
[SPEAKER_11]: So we always need somebody like her.

50
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:50,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Before we start to present them, I'd like all of you, after you've presented with your checks, those of you that are here, would you go out in the corridor so we're not disturbing the whole meeting, the whole night?

51
00:02:51,427 --> 00:02:53,930
[SPEAKER_11]: so that we can take pictures for the newspaper, okay?

52
00:02:55,071 --> 00:03:04,720
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, I would like to present the top winner's first place for the monies raised goes to the Roberts School, and they raised $2,991.

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like

54
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:20,561
[SPEAKER_11]: Hunter Overberg and Liam Antoine and their mothers to come up.

55
00:03:21,081 --> 00:03:30,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Jennifer Antoine, I mean Susan Antoine, I'm sorry, was a huge factor in the money raised for the Robert School.

56
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,192
[SPEAKER_11]: She went out and really knocked herself out to raise money.

57
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:38,796
[SPEAKER_05]: You can come in closer if you want.

58
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:55,683
[SPEAKER_11]: You're welcome.

[SPEAKER_11]: All right, come over here so I can give you, come here, you two and your mothers.

61
00:04:01,988 --> 00:04:03,390
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, no, no, no.

62
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,711

00:15:13,055 --> 00:15:13,296
[SPEAKER_08]: St.

158
00:15:13,356 --> 00:15:14,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Rayfields, okay.

159
00:15:14,576 --> 00:15:15,016
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, St.

160
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:15,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Joseph's is next.

161
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:17,818
[SPEAKER_11]: And St.

162
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:20,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Joseph's is getting a total of $2,750.

163
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:20,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

164
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:21,060
[SPEAKER_11]: St.

165
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Ray's?

166
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,671
[SPEAKER_11]: These guys did the water stand for the race as well.

167
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:46,931
[SPEAKER_11]: And they are receiving a total of $1,475.

168
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Now has everybody been recognized that's here?

169
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,732
[SPEAKER_11]: because we do have checks left over, which we will get to them.

170
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:21,599
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm asking if all of you who are presented checks or are representing, would you just go out in the hallway so we can take a picture, a group picture for everybody.

171
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:30,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Mayor, while we're doing this, while people are gathering, I just want to give my thanks to Judy Lonergan and all the people who help her.

172
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,160
[SPEAKER_09]: She does a tremendous job.

173
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,680
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a fun event.

174
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,462
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been incredibly successful and we thank you very, very much, Judy.

175
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:06,305
[SPEAKER_11]: While they're setting up, I'd like to acknowledge my son, Jay, and my daughter-in-law, Liz, who did tremendous work.

176
00:17:07,146 --> 00:17:13,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Rosemary Adagna, all the people who worked on the committee without them, this would never have been the success it was.

177
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:16,629
[SPEAKER_11]: And we hope that, what are you two doing in the back?

178
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:25,028
[SPEAKER_11]: So many people, it's not a one man show for this or for the festival.

179
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:29,331
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a show of hundreds of people that support these events.

180
00:17:29,551 --> 00:17:31,853
[SPEAKER_11]: And hopefully next year will be even bigger and better.

181
00:17:31,873 --> 00:17:36,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Somebody will have to kneel down.

182
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,541
Susan!

183
00:17:44,842 --> 00:17:45,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Susan!

184
00:17:45,123 --> 00:17:47,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you come up with the trophy?

185
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:13,911
[SPEAKER_14]: While we're under community participation, we'd like to invite Jen DeSales to come up and say a few words about the Medford Children's Art Showcase.

186
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:15,832
Jen, are you?

187
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,211
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

188
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:43,396
[SPEAKER_17]: Jennifer Destels, and my address is 21 Nolwood Road, Medford.

189
00:20:43,837 --> 00:20:45,438
[SPEAKER_17]: Stephanie, can you just hold it a minute, please?

190
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:46,779
[SPEAKER_20]: Just hold it for a minute.

191
00:20:47,600 --> 00:21:00,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

192
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,312
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have two kids at the Columbus.

193
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,050
[SPEAKER_17]: Two kids at the club?

194
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

195
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations.

196
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:06,531
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks.

197
00:21:06,951 --> 00:21:08,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I got some money.

198
00:21:09,671 --> 00:21:13,012
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wrote everything down, so I'm just going to read it.

199
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:18,754
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, school committee members, for this opportunity to speak about the 2016 Medford Children's Art Showcase.

200
00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:25,595
[SPEAKER_17]: With the support of the Medford Arts Council, this seventh annual citywide exhibit will be on display next month.

201
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:33,097
[SPEAKER_17]: As in previous years, art teachers from all Medford public schools were invited to submit work at specific grade levels.

202
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:42,990
[SPEAKER_17]: This exhibit is non-competitive and inclusive so that over the years, every child in the Medford Public Schools has an opportunity to participate.

203
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:46,695
[SPEAKER_17]: This exhibit has grown since 2009 from 29 pieces to hundreds from across the city.

204
00:21:51,464 --> 00:22:11,521
[SPEAKER_17]: In this exhibit, you'll find that our art educators have guided our students to accomplish many things, multiple creative responses to the same parameters, connections to literacy, social studies, math, and science, thoughtful choices about spatial relationships and design, expression of abstract concepts, humor, and visual wit.

205
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:17,986
[SPEAKER_17]: This happens every day in our schools, and this public exhibit offers a glimpse of it outside the classroom walls.

206
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:26,244
[SPEAKER_17]: Sadly, because of reconstruction, our exhibit will no longer be located at the Meadow Glen Mall, as it had been for the past five years.

207
00:22:26,965 --> 00:22:32,387
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to acknowledge the Meadow Glen Mall and Mr. Tim Therot, who helped coordinate this exhibit behind the scenes.

208
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:42,472
[SPEAKER_17]: And with help from the former Mayor McGlynn and our new host at the beautiful Rivers Edge office building in Medford, students will not miss out on taking part this year.

209
00:22:44,128 --> 00:22:51,630
[SPEAKER_17]: This year's exhibit will be on public display from February 8th through 26th, Monday through Friday, during the hours of 8 a.m.

210
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,330
[SPEAKER_17]: to 5 p.m.

211
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:59,131
[SPEAKER_17]: School committee members are invited to the exhibit reception on the evening of Thursday, February 18th, 5.30 to 7.30.

212
00:23:00,591 --> 00:23:08,453
[SPEAKER_17]: Local sketch artists will be donating quick portraits, and talented Medford High School student Fatima Lemos will give a short musical performance.

213
00:23:11,539 --> 00:23:16,126
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to close, I wish to share a brief personal story about why this exhibit is important.

214
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:18,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Perhaps you know someone with a similar background.

215
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:21,754
[SPEAKER_17]: My family moved often when I was a child.

216
00:23:22,355 --> 00:23:24,739
[SPEAKER_17]: This meant that I had to make new friends often.

217
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,481
[SPEAKER_17]: It didn't help that I'm rather quiet, as you can probably tell.

218
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,102
[SPEAKER_17]: In second grade, it happened that I transferred schools twice.

219
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:33,943
[SPEAKER_17]: So try to imagine this.

220
00:23:34,723 --> 00:23:41,406
[SPEAKER_17]: It's my second time as the new girl in the middle of the school year and all these 7 year old strangers are eyeing me with curiosity.

221
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,031
[SPEAKER_17]: We exchange introductions, but it's generally a little awkward.

222
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:49,692
[SPEAKER_17]: But later that day comes a shining moment that quickly dissolves the tension.

223
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,973
[SPEAKER_17]: My new classmates gather around to look at a unicorn that I drew during art.

224
00:23:54,753 --> 00:23:56,694
[SPEAKER_17]: It might not even have been that well drawn.

225
00:23:57,574 --> 00:24:00,875
[SPEAKER_17]: This is nothing momentous for the world, but maybe it is in a small way.

226
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,396
[SPEAKER_17]: My drawing started a conversation.

227
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:06,957
[SPEAKER_17]: We suddenly found voices to talk about it and share a common interest.

228
00:24:07,957 --> 00:24:11,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Even as a child, I learned that art is a way to make connections with others.

229
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:14,839
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just an everyday example of why art education matters at all levels.

230
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:21,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Jen.

231
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:34,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Could we send a letter thanking the managers or the owners of the Medical Inn Mall for their past five years, allowing us to have our children's exhibits there.

232
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:35,805
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also want to thank

233
00:24:37,483 --> 00:24:38,984
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, but it was at Middle Glen Mall.

234
00:24:39,764 --> 00:24:52,632
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, I just want to thank you for your commitment to doing this for our students and our community, so our community gets to see the beautiful work that children create during their school day.

235
00:24:53,212 --> 00:25:02,937
[SPEAKER_07]: It's another way that we get to show the community what's happening in our schools and the beautiful things that we create through our day.

236
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:05,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for your time and your energy.

237
00:25:05,499 --> 00:25:05,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

238
00:25:06,567 --> 00:25:07,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much, Jen.

239
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,510
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll refer to the regular order of business.

240
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Approval of the minutes of January 11, 2016.

241
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:15,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve.

242
00:25:15,672 --> 00:25:16,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval on the floor.

243
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:17,753
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

244
00:25:18,274 --> 00:25:18,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

245
00:25:18,774 --> 00:25:19,474
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

246
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:20,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Minutes are approved.

247
00:25:21,415 --> 00:25:23,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

248
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:24,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval.

249
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:25,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval.

250
00:25:26,018 --> 00:25:28,379
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one question, Mr. Benedetto.

251
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:32,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a question on page 13, National Grid.

252
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,821
[SPEAKER_07]: It says rink expense for the amount of $12,971.

253
00:25:35,161 --> 00:25:45,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that for our use of the rink for both our hockey teams or is that something else?

254
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:46,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Page 13.

255
00:25:48,949 --> 00:25:50,871
[SPEAKER_09]: If you notice, it's a 114 account.

256
00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:51,992
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a school budget.

257
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:56,296
[SPEAKER_09]: The first numbers in the account, that's actually a revolving account.

258
00:25:57,177 --> 00:25:57,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, right.

259
00:25:57,677 --> 00:26:00,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hadn't seen that before in a budget.

260
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:02,422
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thank you.

261
00:26:02,442 --> 00:26:03,182
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

262
00:26:03,623 --> 00:26:05,244
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor for approval by Ms.

263
00:26:05,284 --> 00:26:06,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Vanden Heuvel, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

264
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:07,587
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

265
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:08,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

266
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:09,048
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

267
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:11,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Bill's transfers are approved.

268
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:13,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Approval of payrolls.

269
00:26:14,401 --> 00:26:16,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry.

270
00:26:16,102 --> 00:26:16,962
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

271
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:17,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

272
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:18,483
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

273
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Payrolls are approved.

274
00:26:20,685 --> 00:26:21,705
[SPEAKER_09]: Report of the secretary.

275
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:22,226
[SPEAKER_19]: There is none.

276
00:26:22,606 --> 00:26:23,126
[SPEAKER_09]: There is none.

277
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:25,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Report of committees.

278
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:26,829
[SPEAKER_19]: There is none.

279
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:27,029
[SPEAKER_09]: None.

280
00:26:30,863 --> 00:26:32,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Item seven, report of superintendents.

281
00:26:32,844 --> 00:26:35,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on project 351 program 2016.

282
00:26:35,985 --> 00:26:37,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Superintendent.

283
00:26:37,826 --> 00:26:44,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, project 351 is a project that was originally started by Governor Patrick.

284
00:26:44,328 --> 00:26:46,509
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been continued by Governor Baker.

285
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:48,270
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an outstanding project.

286
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,031
[SPEAKER_14]: It takes place, it begins on Martin Luther King Day.

287
00:26:51,471 --> 00:26:56,453
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a project which brings 351 students from across the Commonwealth, from all the cities and towns,

288
00:26:57,081 --> 00:27:03,225
[SPEAKER_14]: together to celebrate the idea of community service and to perpetuate the ideals of Martin Luther King.

289
00:27:04,025 --> 00:27:05,226
[SPEAKER_14]: It goes on all year.

290
00:27:05,586 --> 00:27:12,891
[SPEAKER_14]: And tonight, our principal, Paul DeLaver, is here with the representative from the city of Medford, Joelle Brown, and her family.

291
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:18,855
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's going to come up and tell you a little bit more about the program and about the participation of Joelle.

292
00:27:18,895 --> 00:27:21,937
[SPEAKER_14]: And she'll tell you a little bit about what her first day was like.

293
00:27:24,719 --> 00:27:26,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, committee members, Madam Mayor,

294
00:27:27,415 --> 00:27:33,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Superintendent Belson, as you know we participated in this program since my tenure of principal.

295
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:40,407
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always been an honor to go through the selection process for picking that eighth grade student that will represent the Andrews Middle School.

296
00:27:41,888 --> 00:27:48,875
[SPEAKER_13]: It goes by nomination and then selection by teacher and Joelle Brown gets it hands down here for the Andrews.

297
00:27:49,782 --> 00:27:52,525
[SPEAKER_13]: She's a great student and a wonderful person.

298
00:27:53,246 --> 00:27:55,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Great face to have at the end.

299
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:59,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Great person to have us representing a face down at 351.

300
00:28:00,823 --> 00:28:07,207
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't want to take the spotlight here because it really is about Joelle and her lovely family that is always there in supporting of the Andrews.

301
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:12,271
[SPEAKER_13]: So Joelle, you explain exactly what happened when you went down last Monday.

302
00:28:12,731 --> 00:28:13,051
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

303
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:20,897
[SPEAKER_12]: So last Monday, I joined another whole group of students at the Taunt Hall and Funeral Hall in Boston.

304
00:28:21,597 --> 00:28:24,319
[SPEAKER_12]: And we did a bunch of projects at IBA.

305
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:27,021
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a Hispanic church in Boston.

306
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:30,143
[SPEAKER_12]: We painted murals, made scarves from the homeless.

307
00:28:31,103 --> 00:28:38,895
[SPEAKER_12]: And we ended our day at JFK Library where Charlie Rose came and spoke to us about community service and recapped our whole day.

308
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:40,138
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was really fun there.

309
00:28:40,698 --> 00:28:42,702
[SPEAKER_12]: I was proud to be a representative of Medford.

310
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations to all of you.

311
00:28:48,497 --> 00:28:50,998
[SPEAKER_13]: And as I must add, this project is still ongoing.

312
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,600
[SPEAKER_13]: She actually missed a conference call tonight to be here with you guys.

313
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,821
[SPEAKER_13]: But we called ahead and made sure that it was OK for her to be here as well.

314
00:28:58,841 --> 00:29:01,763
[SPEAKER_13]: So she's going to be taking up that venture.

315
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:04,284
[SPEAKER_13]: But this project does continue throughout the whole year.

316
00:29:04,324 --> 00:29:07,205
[SPEAKER_13]: So the kickoff is really on Martin Luther King Day.

317
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,426
[SPEAKER_13]: But the project still goes on all the way through the year.

318
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:20,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say I've had the privilege of actually being involved with 351 and seeing the students That I've seen every year.

319
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:27,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I Was not at the town hall this year, but I know What goes on and it's just amazing.

320
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,742
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing to see the amount of students that are there.

321

00:29:33,326 --> 00:29:38,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone just wants to help each other and the experiences that our kids get is incredible.

324
00:29:38,772 --> 00:29:48,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't express how happy I am that we have Medford at the table and we have our representatives of our city go down and be part of this wonderful project.

325
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:52,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So I thank you and I keep on thanking all the students that are always involved.

329
00:30:17,407 --> 00:30:18,448

00:30:48,078 --> 00:30:50,065
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure she wants a taste.

338
00:30:54,643 --> 00:31:08,108
[SPEAKER_14]: So Madam Mayor and members of the committee, I also attach to this a press release on the Martin Luther King Day activity at the community center in which several of our students participated.

339
00:31:08,128 --> 00:31:09,988
[SPEAKER_14]: This is informational for you.

340
00:31:10,028 --> 00:31:14,510
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll schedule another time for them to come down and be recognized for their work as well.

341
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:18,871
[SPEAKER_14]: But this evening, it was not appropriate for them to come down at this time, not possible.

342
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:27,377
[SPEAKER_20]: While I was not able to go this year, I did attend last year, and altogether this year there were 20 Medford students.

343
00:31:27,437 --> 00:31:31,580
[SPEAKER_20]: And I know last year when the kids spoke, it just blew everybody away.

344
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:36,503
[SPEAKER_20]: And I happen to know one of these students, and he's such a fabulous kid.

345
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:42,628
[SPEAKER_20]: And these are the sorts of things which, again, makes Medford awfully proud when our students go out and speak like this.

346
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:46,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was honored to be in attendance that day at St.

347
00:31:46,386 --> 00:31:49,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Rayfield's Parish Hall, which is a beautiful facility.

348
00:31:49,187 --> 00:31:51,648
[SPEAKER_09]: And the young students did an amazing job.

349
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:52,828
[SPEAKER_09]: They spoke so eloquently.

350
00:31:52,848 --> 00:32:00,150
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so very proud of what they had to say about community and giving back and recognizing that they may have been through some difficult times.

351
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,271
[SPEAKER_09]: But in order to move forward, you have to address the issues that are before you.

352
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,332
[SPEAKER_09]: And they did a fabulous job.

353
00:32:05,412 --> 00:32:08,112
[SPEAKER_09]: So congratulations to you all.

354
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:09,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Make us proud.

355
00:32:13,604 --> 00:32:16,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on Focus K-2 grant program.

356
00:32:17,506 --> 00:32:24,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Mayor, members of the committee, I'm going to call on our assistant superintendent, Diane Caldwell, to tell you about this program, which we're doing with the state.

357
00:32:25,489 --> 00:32:26,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

358
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:38,254
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am very proud to announce that Shore Collaborative, along with Medford, Cambridge, and Malden Public Schools, has been awarded a Focus K-2 grant for $112,000 for school year 2015-16.

359
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:57,666
[SPEAKER_02]: This grant supports the statewide goal of improving literacy from kindergarten through second grade and will enhance the role of educational collaboratives as a partner with the ESC and school districts in early literacy.

360
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:02,530
[SPEAKER_02]: The grant is part of a four-year plan to improve literacy in the state.

361
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:11,517
[SPEAKER_02]: The grant allows Medford Public Schools to participate in professional development training on effective early learning literacy practices.

362
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:29,267
[SPEAKER_02]: These practices are designed to improve curriculum and instruction and assessment approaches exemplified by Focus K-2, a research-based curriculum developed by Boston Public Schools Early Childhood Department and its higher education partners.

363
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:39,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Boston Public Schools is currently piloting a similarly structured curriculum for the first grade and the second grade curriculum is under development.

364
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:48,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Educators will learn about effective practices in early literacy through the integrated developmentally appropriate approach

365
00:33:49,273 --> 00:33:51,715
[SPEAKER_02]: to curriculum, instruction, and assessments.

366
00:33:52,596 --> 00:34:07,130
[SPEAKER_02]: The practices and content are aligned with the mass curriculum frameworks in English language arts, social studies, and science, as well as the National Association for the Education of Young Children, otherwise known as NIAC, standards and the WIDA standards.

367
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:34,138
[SPEAKER_02]: So this grant will pay for the following, training provided by Boston Public Schools, district school participants' attendance at two statewide conferences as well as two regional conferences, reimbursement back to districts for substitutes for the days of the training that the staff goes to, staff mileage expenditures, classroom supplies, $500 for kindergarten teachers,

368
00:34:36,148 --> 00:34:48,775
[SPEAKER_02]: who participate in the grant, and there's a literacy specialist who will work with our teachers to begin preparing and laying the foundation for implementing the Focus K-2 project.

369
00:34:49,856 --> 00:34:52,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford Public Schools is committed to a one-year

370
00:34:53,956 --> 00:34:58,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just from January to June and we just found out last week that we were awarded this grant.

371
00:34:59,737 --> 00:35:01,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an exploration approach.

372
00:35:02,698 --> 00:35:14,221
[SPEAKER_02]: Training will provide an introduction and overview of the principles as well as instruction, assessment and practices embedded in the curriculum for kindergarten through second grade.

373
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:21,342
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a team of teachers, K through two, that will be attending two conferences and the regional meetings.

374
00:35:22,183 --> 00:35:32,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Each teacher will select at least one practice or principal from the state conference to work in their schools and then attend the regional networking meetings.

375
00:35:33,313 --> 00:35:42,601
[SPEAKER_02]: We will meet towards the end of this school year to decide if this approach to learning warrants a continuation of three more years for this grant.

376
00:35:44,257 --> 00:35:54,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I have brought with me this evening, well actually they came by themselves, but Maria Skiffington and Amanda Gass have piloted this grant since September.

377
00:35:55,092 --> 00:36:10,423
[SPEAKER_02]: On their own, they went to Boston Public Schools this past summer and learned all about Focus K2 and were so excited about the thematic changes in the developmental approach to kindergarten that they got me on board with this in a hurry.

378
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:13,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to ask Amanda and Maria to come up.

379
00:36:14,165 --> 00:36:31,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Inside your packet, I have provided you with an introduction to Focus K2, an integrated approach towards teaching and learning, Amanda and Maria's daily schedules and their kindergarten curriculum map and a list of the literature used during the school year.

380
00:36:32,137 --> 00:36:32,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

381
00:36:32,397 --> 00:36:32,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Gass and Ms.

382
00:36:33,018 --> 00:36:36,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Giffington are here to answer any questions you might have.

383
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:41,125
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking at this as an introduction for us.

384
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:50,013
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have a lot of other kindergarten teachers who are very interested in attending the conferences that will be coming up in the next month or two.

385
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:51,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are my stars.

386
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:53,316
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been doing this since September.

387
00:36:53,917 --> 00:36:57,500
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have any questions, I'm sure they'd be happy to answer them.

388
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Mayor?

389
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:02,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

390
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:09,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a question how this relates to the journeys program that we recently purchased and how we're going to use both programs.

391
00:37:14,181 --> 00:37:21,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Journeys is actually a separate program that is wound into it through literacy.

392
00:37:21,103 --> 00:37:28,624
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a literacy block too, but focus is an integrated center based kind of approach.

393
00:37:29,545 --> 00:37:32,806
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever we learn in Journeys is brought into the integrated centers.

394
00:37:33,346 --> 00:37:35,846
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're using both programs at the same time?

395
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're integrated.

396
00:37:37,226 --> 00:37:45,028
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think in the document that you gave us, there's a curriculum map, and you can see exactly how Journeys fits into it along with them.

397
00:37:45,048 --> 00:37:45,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

398
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:57,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make sure that we're utilizing the program that we just recently purchased, because we really want to give that program time to build from our really beginning foundation grades up

399
00:37:58,449 --> 00:38:09,333
[SPEAKER_07]: because I believe that that program will help raise our scores for both MCAS, but not even that, but will help, you know, all of our students in vocabulary and in so many ways.

400
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:14,515
[SPEAKER_07]: And if every student across the district is learning from the same program, I really like that.

401
00:38:14,575 --> 00:38:19,917
[SPEAKER_07]: So that way, as they get to different grade levels where they, they mingle together.

402
00:38:20,316 --> 00:38:23,698
[SPEAKER_07]: they've all had the same basics and that goes smoothly.

403
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:24,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

404
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:29,002
[SPEAKER_06]: It was designed to be able to incorporate whatever literacy or math program you have.

405
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:37,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so it's kind of like an overall approach center wise and then these things get plugged in and we, we follow the journeys.

406
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:40,031
[SPEAKER_06]: program, Boston follows whatever theirs is.

407
00:38:40,431 --> 00:38:41,172
[SPEAKER_07]: That's terrific.

408
00:38:41,272 --> 00:38:42,452
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really happy to hear that.

409
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:45,433
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's a great opportunity for us to learn more.

410
00:38:45,594 --> 00:39:00,740
[SPEAKER_21]: And the program also builds on, so the common core standards, the comprehension standards, on top of the journeys curriculum, the focus on K2 builds on that and supports those concepts from journeys.

411
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love that the classroom teaches directly at $500 to get

412
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:11,039
[SPEAKER_07]: what they need for classroom supplies, and you get to choose what those are?

413
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no.

414
00:39:15,682 --> 00:39:21,465
[SPEAKER_06]: When you look at what we have to do, there was a lot of need for certain types of books.

415
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:23,886
[SPEAKER_06]: We needed a lot of paint.

416
00:39:25,747 --> 00:39:30,949
[SPEAKER_06]: We needed a lot of different art supplies that we never used before, like clay and things like that.

417
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,251
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a really

418
00:39:34,563 --> 00:39:35,583
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really cool approach.

419
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:37,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're very artistic.

420
00:39:37,884 --> 00:39:38,724
[SPEAKER_06]: They work together.

421
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:42,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we saw them just collaborate on making these dioramas.

422
00:39:42,485 --> 00:39:47,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Little kids, and you hear them talking about how to, you know, we should put a wolf den here, and we should do this here.

423
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:53,289
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, there's just a lot of different materials based on what the center is.

424
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:04,166
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I observed both Amanda and Maria within the past two weeks, and I was amazed by the science projects the children were doing.

425
00:40:04,747 --> 00:40:08,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Ana Paula and I know that you're coming to visit the Roberts Elementary tomorrow.

426
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,450
[SPEAKER_02]: We welcome you there.

427
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:16,756
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you get a chance to come see what the ladies are doing, you'll be amazed by what they do.

428
00:40:16,976 --> 00:40:17,937
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to come by.

429
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to come by.

430
00:40:20,038 --> 00:40:20,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll schedule that soon.

431
00:40:21,459 --> 00:40:21,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

432
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, anytime.

433
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

434
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Cooney.

435
00:40:24,162 --> 00:40:24,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

436
00:40:24,482 --> 00:40:26,565
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I want to say thank you and congratulations.

437
00:40:26,605 --> 00:40:27,467
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

438
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:35,338
[SPEAKER_05]: The $112,000 grant, is that a, it's a short collaborative effort, Cambridge Malden.

439
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:38,803
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that all of us with the same amount of money divided up or?

440
00:40:39,463 --> 00:40:46,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wrote the grant with Shore Collaborative and my piece, our piece of it is $52,000.

441
00:40:46,391 --> 00:40:48,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, because that made me feel better.

442
00:40:49,135 --> 00:40:52,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Now $52,000 divided by three years or just for this year?

443
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:57,224
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just for this year and then we'll meet towards the end of the year and actually

444
00:40:58,285 --> 00:41:09,830
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to invite first grade teachers to some of the networking meetings and conferences because if we decide that kindergarten is great and we may want to follow it up to first grade, I would like the first grade teachers involved in this.

445
00:41:10,491 --> 00:41:14,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the school year we'll decide whether we want to go for another three years.

446
00:41:15,413 --> 00:41:20,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so this particular grant then is just for this year, and then you would have to re-assess?

447
00:41:20,376 --> 00:41:22,637
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to rewrite a grant in June.

448
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:28,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and if you have to rewrite it, would it be for that particular year, or would it be like, you think, in a three-year span?

449
00:41:29,381 --> 00:41:33,363
[SPEAKER_02]: So the really nice part of this grant is, we can write it for three years.

450
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:44,735
[SPEAKER_02]: But after a year, if we decide this is just what we want to do, kindergarten one, we can stop after one year if it's not exactly what we want in second grade.

451
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:44,955
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

452
00:41:44,995 --> 00:41:50,557
[SPEAKER_05]: And the $500 for the kindergarten teachers, is that included within the money that they're giving us, or is that above the money?

453
00:41:50,637 --> 00:41:51,558
[SPEAKER_05]: That's included in the money.

454
00:41:51,578 --> 00:41:52,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.

455
00:41:52,058 --> 00:41:52,338
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

456
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,860
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have to spend $500 in the supplies like they're saying.

457
00:41:57,581 --> 00:41:57,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

458
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:00,302
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of literature that both ladies

459
00:42:01,798 --> 00:42:06,501
[SPEAKER_02]: actually, you sent me the list of what you needed during the summer, and we were able to get that for the ladies.

460
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:07,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes to about $500.

461
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:08,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was great.

462
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:10,323
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you.

463
00:42:10,643 --> 00:42:10,824
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

464
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:11,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Kreatz?

465
00:42:11,264 --> 00:42:21,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I wanted to say I was really, I enjoyed reading it, and I especially liked the year-long implementation of the community animal habitats, construction in our

466
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,501
[SPEAKER_16]: It was amazing.

467
00:42:23,521 --> 00:42:24,802
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds very exciting.

468
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,325
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'd be interested in observing one of the classes.

469
00:42:27,785 --> 00:42:29,147
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll definitely get in touch with you.

470
00:42:30,067 --> 00:42:31,088
[SPEAKER_16]: I really like it.

471
00:42:31,818 --> 00:42:33,939
[SPEAKER_21]: those thematic units that we do.

472
00:42:34,399 --> 00:42:37,400
[SPEAKER_21]: We're just wrapping up our second one on animals and habitats.

473
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:45,223
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's culminating with a showcase that we're gonna have other kindergartens walk through, but parents, it's parent night.

474
00:42:45,883 --> 00:42:48,044
[SPEAKER_21]: But they really own it, you know?

475
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:49,845
[SPEAKER_21]: And they really care about it.

476
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:52,786
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not just information that's being thrown at them.

477
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:55,627
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're really, we're very excited.

478
00:42:55,727 --> 00:42:58,348
[SPEAKER_21]: But it makes a lot of sense for this age group.

479
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:02,025
[SPEAKER_06]: But if anybody does want to come, we are doing the centers.

480
00:43:02,045 --> 00:43:06,809
[SPEAKER_06]: We usually do them around 1030 to about quarter of 12?

481
00:43:07,189 --> 00:43:07,349
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

482
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:08,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Quarter of 12?

483
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:09,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

484
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:10,711
[SPEAKER_06]: Quarter of 12.

485
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:16,155
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you come those times, you'll see focus and take to an action.

486
00:43:17,516 --> 00:43:18,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss Mustone.

487
00:43:19,158 --> 00:43:20,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you both for being here, Ms.

488
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:20,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Caldwell.

489
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:30,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to see if you could just speak about how great it would be to have a full-time aide while you roll out this K through 2 grant program.

490
00:43:31,147 --> 00:43:35,391
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like there's a lot of writing, which is hard to do with 20 kids with one adult.

491
00:43:36,431 --> 00:43:37,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ms.

492
00:43:37,232 --> 00:43:41,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Mastone, we are working on trying to get full-time aides.

493
00:43:42,056 --> 00:43:46,179
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that I know will come up in meetings as we go along.

494
00:43:47,146 --> 00:43:50,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it does help if you have a full-time aide to help you throughout the day.

495
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:51,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

496
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:59,278
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's certain questions that we have to prompt the kids as they're working, and there's about, what, eight centers?

497
00:43:59,918 --> 00:44:07,706
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's great if we could have another person asking those in-depth questions so that we can have them, you know, working on critical thinking skills while they're working.

498
00:44:07,846 --> 00:44:09,687
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that would definitely help.

499
00:44:10,528 --> 00:44:12,390
[SPEAKER_21]: And as the year goes on, working with

500
00:44:16,526 --> 00:44:21,370
[SPEAKER_21]: Something that's unique about Focus on K2 is the goal is really this higher order thinking.

501
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:29,256
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you walk into one of our classrooms, we will hand you a list of questions that you will be responsible for asking the kids at the center.

502
00:44:29,456 --> 00:44:31,758
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're not just playing with blocks.

503
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:36,041
[SPEAKER_21]: You're using certain vocabulary.

504
00:44:36,441 --> 00:44:44,467
[SPEAKER_21]: And so while we're working with small groups, our instructional aid is definitely in charge of doing that at the centers, as are any visitors.

505
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:51,805
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm really anticipating my visit tomorrow morning with the kids.

506
00:44:52,245 --> 00:45:05,791
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to tell you that interestingly, way back when, when we had the Hervey Developmental School, this reminds me very, very, very much of what my students, my own kids had at the Hervey for developmental education.

507
00:45:06,211 --> 00:45:10,973
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, one of the greatest differences actually is when I got to the last page and I saw some

508
00:45:11,353 --> 00:45:14,815
[SPEAKER_20]: emphasis on phonics, which is one thing they didn't do particularly well back then.

509
00:45:15,455 --> 00:45:21,338
[SPEAKER_20]: But the small group and like you said, you know, the kids doing the most amazing projects and working together.

510
00:45:21,378 --> 00:45:24,860
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a joy and I'm really anticipating seeing your classrooms tomorrow.

511
00:45:28,326 --> 00:45:39,537
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to add actually, I love this idea because it's hands on and it's something that I know that we've been talking about for a long time because of all the testing that goes around our academics.

512
00:45:40,017 --> 00:45:42,760
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a great opportunity, especially for young children.

513
00:45:43,271 --> 00:45:44,212
[SPEAKER_05]: That it's difficult.

514
00:45:44,352 --> 00:45:51,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's difficult when they have like, you know, IEPs or they're coming from a different culture or they're coming, you know, they don't know the language.

515
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,701
[SPEAKER_05]: This is hands on.

516
00:45:53,162 --> 00:46:00,410
[SPEAKER_05]: And it not only brings what they're learning to it, but it brings the community and the social part of it, which is just amazing.

517
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:05,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, is this going to be something that all the schools are going to be involved with?

518
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:17,312
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've asked for two representatives of kindergartens from each of the schools, so it's equitable, to participate in the conferences and the networking meetings.

519
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:20,453
[SPEAKER_02]: And one first grade teacher.

520
00:46:20,933 --> 00:46:25,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we just found out we got the grant last week, the email went out today.

521
00:46:25,374 --> 00:46:27,674
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got four replies so far.

522
00:46:28,234 --> 00:46:35,776
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if it's possible to do, but I was just thinking just for a fun thing, maybe at the end, is to try to put all

523
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:41,292
[SPEAKER_05]: the projects together and actually put it out as a display where people could come and see it.

524
00:46:41,512 --> 00:46:44,854
[SPEAKER_05]: And the students could actually see, you know, what they've done.

525
00:46:44,874 --> 00:46:49,256
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting that you bring that up because it does end in, there's a culminating project.

526
00:46:49,576 --> 00:46:49,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

527
00:46:49,876 --> 00:46:52,018
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're actually going to contact Mrs.

528
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:53,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, see, I just got to start.

529
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:56,659
[SPEAKER_06]: How about it?

530
00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:00,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so there is a project called, what we're thinking is called My Medford.

531
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:01,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Boston has My Boston.

532
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:06,700
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a kind of a request put forth by the mayor.

533
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:16,462
[SPEAKER_06]: And the kids rise to the occasion and come up with the way, whatever the mayor decides what we should do.

534
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:21,863
[SPEAKER_06]: In Boston, they're doing how can we make Boston more child-friendly and more

535
00:47:23,447 --> 00:47:24,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a really good point.

536
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:26,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a really good point.

537
00:47:37,579 --> 00:47:53,622
[SPEAKER_05]: but at the end of the school year, we actually did it up at the high school, and everyone came, and it was really a nice, it was really joyful to see the students, as you said, take their ownership of it, but it was nice to see a nice, it was competitive, but it was in a nice way.

538
00:47:53,642 --> 00:48:04,004
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't really competitive that we have to take your school down, but just to really see what everybody did, and it actually gave a great opportunity to a community to come in and see what the students were doing.

539
00:48:05,415 --> 00:48:07,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mayor Burke will be getting in contact with you soon.

540
00:48:08,017 --> 00:48:09,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking about that.

541
00:48:09,697 --> 00:48:11,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

542
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:12,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

543
00:48:12,879 --> 00:48:13,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

544
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

545
00:48:15,861 --> 00:48:16,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Superintendent.

546
00:48:16,982 --> 00:48:21,144
[SPEAKER_14]: So I want to point this out because I think Paulette hit it from the head.

547
00:48:21,664 --> 00:48:22,925
[SPEAKER_14]: We were doing this for years.

548
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:28,888
[SPEAKER_14]: And this was part of what we call developmentally appropriate learning at the early grades.

549
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:35,032
[SPEAKER_14]: And the standards curriculum came in and it pushed academic learning down.

550
00:48:36,678 --> 00:48:38,618
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had this discussion with the kindergarten teachers.

551
00:48:38,638 --> 00:48:45,960
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually had a meeting last year where we were talking about what kindergarten teachers need to do in the assessment of students and the like.

552
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,881
[SPEAKER_14]: And we made the commitment to look more developmentally appropriate.

553
00:48:50,701 --> 00:48:52,021
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what you do at Elliott Pearson.

554
00:48:52,982 --> 00:48:54,442
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what you do at some of these places.

555
00:48:54,482 --> 00:49:00,983
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're trying to get kindergarten one, two, to look more developmentally appropriate and to be more developmentally appropriate.

556
00:49:01,003 --> 00:49:03,484
[SPEAKER_14]: You may have seen that Mayor Walsh in Boston

557
00:49:04,633 --> 00:49:07,215
[SPEAKER_14]: advocated for an expanded early childhood program recently.

558
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:10,216
[SPEAKER_14]: The governor is still not committal at this particular point.

559
00:49:10,877 --> 00:49:16,000
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is a very powerful strand of advocacy that's going on in the state.

560
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,461
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is the money's not behind him, yet.

561
00:49:19,682 --> 00:49:33,330
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a lot going on with early childhood, trying to get it back to what early childhood is really supposed to be about, which is helping youngsters do things tactile, to play, to learn through play, integrate learning, and not get siloed into academic areas.

562
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:38,273
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that you're going to see more of, because I think people are catching on again.

563
00:49:38,874 --> 00:49:44,578
[SPEAKER_14]: They're starting to, if you will, rebel against the academic infusion that goes down too low.

564
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:47,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Because as youngsters develop, this is how they learn.

565
00:49:48,341 --> 00:49:49,962
[SPEAKER_14]: And then they're ready to do academics.

566
00:49:51,063 --> 00:49:52,744
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't rush the learning.

567
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:54,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people think you can speed it up.

568
00:49:54,626 --> 00:49:55,086
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't.

569
00:49:55,887 --> 00:49:56,968
[SPEAKER_14]: If you do, you miss steps.

570
00:49:57,568 --> 00:49:59,950
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's really important for us to understand how significant this is.

571
00:50:02,451 --> 00:50:05,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive and place on file.

572
00:50:06,232 --> 00:50:06,992
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

573
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:07,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

574
00:50:07,392 --> 00:50:08,212
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

575
00:50:08,653 --> 00:50:09,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

576
00:50:09,233 --> 00:50:10,033
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for being here.

577
00:50:10,473 --> 00:50:11,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

578
00:50:11,533 --> 00:50:11,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

579
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:13,374
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

580
00:50:13,794 --> 00:50:17,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on Environmental Science, Chapter 74, Program Approval.

581
00:50:18,795 --> 00:50:21,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee,

582
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Our Director of Vocational Education, Heidi Riccio, is here.

583
00:50:26,381 --> 00:50:29,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Heidi Riccio is here.

584
00:50:29,962 --> 00:50:30,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Give her credit.

585
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:31,662
[SPEAKER_14]: She worked hard.

586
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:35,944
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's a lot of vocational reports tonight.

587
00:50:36,644 --> 00:50:43,906
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's start with the environmental science report, which is a significant addition to our programs.

588
00:50:44,586 --> 00:50:46,367
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had a visit from the state the other day.

589
00:50:46,387 --> 00:50:47,787
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's really quite fun.

590
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:49,888
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to let Heidi go into it.

591
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Superintendent Belson, Mayor Burke.

592
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:55,458
[SPEAKER_10]: and District Committee.

593
00:50:56,698 --> 00:51:08,542
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, in the spring of 2014, Medford Vocational Technical High School applied for 10 new Chapter 74 programs with the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

594
00:51:09,842 --> 00:51:22,907
[SPEAKER_10]: That next year, in school year 14-15, we received approval for seven of those 10 programs, which was pretty aggressive on our part, but definitely necessary in moving the school forward into the 21st century.

595
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:32,212
[SPEAKER_10]: We did not get approval for hospitality, design and visual communications, and the environmental science.

596
00:51:32,992 --> 00:51:41,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Hospitality and design and visual are part of two existing programs that we already have approval for, and that's why we opted to focus on environmental science.

597
00:51:42,495 --> 00:51:51,777
[SPEAKER_10]: We did post for a position in the spring, and it is extremely difficult to find a licensed Chapter 74 environmental science instructor.

598
00:51:52,398 --> 00:51:57,945
[SPEAKER_10]: as it has a completely separate license than any other science in a comprehensive setting.

599
00:51:59,346 --> 00:52:06,695
[SPEAKER_10]: This delayed our approval of the environmental science program, which it was the only factor that did delay in us not getting approval.

600
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:15,943
[SPEAKER_10]: In the fall of 2015, we were fortunate enough to take on or re-post for that position.

601
00:52:16,643 --> 00:52:27,971
[SPEAKER_10]: And after a couple of months of not getting any applications, we did seek a retired environmental science instructor who actually wrote the curriculum frameworks for the state.

602
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:36,496
[SPEAKER_10]: He also happens to be a board member of our program advisory committee, as well as assist in the fells.

603
00:52:37,778 --> 00:52:39,259
[SPEAKER_10]: So his name is Charles Sonier.

604
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:42,162
[SPEAKER_10]: He happened to graduate from Medford High School.

605
00:52:42,442 --> 00:52:44,645
[SPEAKER_10]: He is currently in Arlington.

606
00:52:45,405 --> 00:52:57,517
[SPEAKER_10]: And because he recently retired from Essex Agricultural or Essex Technical High School, the state will reward or re-award his license, provided that he does the professional development.

607
00:52:58,655 --> 00:53:06,499
[SPEAKER_10]: So, last Thursday, I would like to thank Superintendent Belson as he sat through the entire two-hour meeting in environmental science.

608
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:08,800
[SPEAKER_10]: We had two individuals from the state.

609
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:19,885
[SPEAKER_10]: We had an OSHA safety visit from David Edmonds, who is in charge of OSHA and safety training for the state, as well as Mara Russell, who is our liaison for Chapter 74.

610
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:22,116
[SPEAKER_10]: programs.

611
00:53:22,736 --> 00:53:29,939
[SPEAKER_10]: They come in and they inspect, so we actually have to have a program advisory committee where we had seven members present from the community.

612
00:53:30,439 --> 00:53:41,563
[SPEAKER_10]: We had Alicia Hunt as well from the city, but we also had members from Tufts University and other companies and businesses around Medford that directly relate with environmental science.

613
00:53:42,463 --> 00:53:44,964
[SPEAKER_10]: After inspection, there were just a couple minor

614
00:53:47,149 --> 00:53:50,410
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't really safety concerns, but there was a box where it shouldn't have been.

615
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:53,671
[SPEAKER_10]: So we simply picked up the box and moved it to another location.

616
00:53:54,191 --> 00:53:59,092
[SPEAKER_10]: But other than that, everything is in its way or on its way.

617
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:04,733
[SPEAKER_10]: We're waiting for final approval from the state, but we really have no indication of why we wouldn't get it.

618
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:09,494
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully by next school committee meeting, we will have that final approval.

619
00:54:11,097 --> 00:54:18,599
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, again, Heidi, thank you for all your work for you and your staff.

620
00:54:19,979 --> 00:54:22,520
[SPEAKER_05]: You've done a tremendous job in such a short amount of time.

621
00:54:24,421 --> 00:54:27,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Just out of curiosity, why didn't we get hospitality, design, and visual?

622
00:54:28,742 --> 00:54:33,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they're part of existing programs of culinary arts and graphic communications,

623
00:54:34,091 --> 00:54:36,393
[SPEAKER_10]: We had to divide and conquer.

624
00:54:36,413 --> 00:54:40,336
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have excessive funds in teaching staff.

625
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:45,501
[SPEAKER_10]: And so there is a special license that holds for hospitality and design and visual.

626
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:54,789
[SPEAKER_10]: So because it's naturally embedded into those existing programs, we opted for the programs that we do not have that are not part of another program.

627
00:54:55,149 --> 00:54:56,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Which would make sense, but I was just curious.

628
00:54:56,810 --> 00:55:01,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it basically the reasoning is because we don't have the teacher in place for this?

629
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:04,198
[SPEAKER_05]: for the hospitality and design?

630
00:55:04,878 --> 00:55:05,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

631
00:55:05,498 --> 00:55:07,740
[SPEAKER_10]: So the future would be that, yes.

632
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:20,267
[SPEAKER_10]: So our intent is in the next two to three years would be to hire a design and visual instructor that is licensed in design and visual, but then also to hire a hospitality instructor that is licensed in hospitality.

633
00:55:20,927 --> 00:55:29,372
[SPEAKER_05]: And out of everything that we've already, that we already offer and what you're trying to place now, um, do you see any other type of,

634
00:55:29,845 --> 00:55:34,207
[SPEAKER_05]: major that maybe we should be really looking into that we haven't touched upon yet?

635
00:55:35,308 --> 00:55:36,028
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot.

636
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:44,472
[SPEAKER_10]: So information technology is something that we really should be considering in the next couple of years.

637
00:55:44,533 --> 00:55:50,035
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason is, is that networking will become extremely critical or it already is critical.

638
00:55:50,075 --> 00:55:53,157
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a workforce demand and shortage plumbing.

639
00:55:53,177 --> 00:55:55,078
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a workforce demand and shortage.

640
00:55:55,818 --> 00:56:07,650
[SPEAKER_10]: The average age of a plumber is 56 years old in the state of Massachusetts, and all plumbers have to go through some sort of a trade schooling, so that would be another program.

641
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:13,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and I mean, you've seen the numbers and what students are asking for.

642
00:56:14,229 --> 00:56:20,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you say that what you just said to, you know, the two things that you just mentioned, the informational technology and the plumbing.

643
00:56:20,697 --> 00:56:24,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know that plumbing has been something that's been really on the top of our list for a very long time.

644
00:56:25,522 --> 00:56:29,687
[SPEAKER_05]: So what stops us from having the plumbing part of this?

645
00:56:30,461 --> 00:56:50,325
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we do have HVAC, and I would like to point out that most HVAC technicians are also licensed plumbers, and the reason is that HVAC includes a combination of sheet metal or metal fabrication, plumbing, and electrical, so they actually need to learn three different segments of that larger industry.

646
00:56:51,045 --> 00:57:00,488
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think you have to look at what programs that we don't have that are part of other programs, because you're looking at transferable skill sets.

647
00:57:00,728 --> 00:57:05,750
[SPEAKER_10]: So, within that construction industry, there are transferable skill sets in all of those industries.

648
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:07,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

649
00:57:08,851 --> 00:57:08,991
[SPEAKER_20]: Ms.

650
00:57:09,011 --> 00:57:09,471
[SPEAKER_20]: Vantaflue.

651
00:57:10,572 --> 00:57:17,594
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to mention that by chance, about, I think, two years ago, I met Mr. Solnier, and at that time, I was just

652
00:57:18,032 --> 00:57:29,582
[SPEAKER_20]: hoping that at some point we could tempt him to become the teacher because his passion, his knowledge, his expertise in this field, and his knowledge of the fellows is just extraordinary.

653
00:57:30,022 --> 00:57:34,606
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm sure that this program is getting off on the very best foot with him in that position.

654
00:57:35,027 --> 00:57:36,007
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm glad you were able to get him.

655
00:57:36,048 --> 00:57:36,488
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

656
00:57:37,168 --> 00:57:37,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Us too.

657
00:57:38,229 --> 00:57:39,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto?

658
00:57:39,711 --> 00:57:40,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had a question.

659
00:57:41,252 --> 00:57:44,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Sawyer agreed to take this position on a part-time basis.

660
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:45,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

661
00:57:46,242 --> 00:57:54,752
[SPEAKER_07]: That with the other teaching time that other teachers can provide would be enough to open this?

662
00:57:55,933 --> 00:58:01,980
[SPEAKER_10]: No, the intention, so because it's a new program, we have just grade 10 students, grade 9 and 10 students in there.

663
00:58:02,933 --> 00:58:13,776
[SPEAKER_10]: And whenever you start a program that is STEM-related, particularly in biotechnology and environmental science, it takes a good five years before kids understand what that program is.

664
00:58:13,896 --> 00:58:23,059
[SPEAKER_10]: So through the exploratory process, can we educate the students and the parents on what is environmental science, because it is a very broad field.

665
00:58:23,559 --> 00:58:27,361
[SPEAKER_10]: So you really kind of have to hone in on it, as well as biotechnology.

666
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:31,982
[SPEAKER_10]: So currently, the part-time schedule is OK, because the numbers

667
00:58:32,957 --> 00:58:35,358
[SPEAKER_10]: kind of dictate what staffing levels you need.

668
00:58:35,458 --> 00:58:40,799
[SPEAKER_10]: However, in the future, we would need to seek full-time employment as an environmental science teacher.

669
00:58:41,379 --> 00:58:45,140
[SPEAKER_07]: And how are we about, how are we going about recruiting for that position?

670
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:50,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if we're going to need it in the near future, are we contacting any colleges with people with that major?

671
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:58,563
[SPEAKER_10]: So the problem with contacting colleges is that chapter 74 license demands not only college education,

672
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:00,371
[SPEAKER_10]: but field experience.

673
00:59:00,531 --> 00:59:04,674
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can't actually get licensed as a vocational teacher fresh out of college.

674
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:12,700
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's critical, because we're teaching students how to actually work and be eligible for college at the same time.

675
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:16,543
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not as simple as going to a college or university system.

676
00:59:17,003 --> 00:59:22,647
[SPEAKER_10]: However, with Charles Cernier, he's very well connected in that industry.

677
00:59:23,167 --> 00:59:26,730
[SPEAKER_10]: So we believe that we'll be able to seek appropriate

678
00:59:27,641 --> 00:59:30,342
[SPEAKER_10]: applicants and guide them towards a licensure.

679
00:59:30,502 --> 00:59:37,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Because sometimes experts in the field get taken aback by all of the licensure requirements at the Department of Education.

680
00:59:37,705 --> 00:59:41,966
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will be there to kind of hold their hand through the process.

681
00:59:43,467 --> 00:59:46,808
[SPEAKER_07]: My other question is interest from students.

682
00:59:46,948 --> 00:59:50,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you see that this shop will be

683
00:59:51,637 --> 00:59:54,398
[SPEAKER_07]: build an interest through the next few years.

684
00:59:54,598 --> 01:00:05,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it has to build, like it goes through just the freshmen and sophomores taken as exploratory and then it's more like the third year that students actually are going to be enrolling in the shop.

685
01:00:06,044 --> 01:00:06,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I correct?

686
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:09,165
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they actually enroll as freshmen.

687
01:00:09,245 --> 01:00:13,167
[SPEAKER_10]: Halfway through, after their exploratory process, they choose their program.

688
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:20,992
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now biotechnology and environmental science are considered a one major until their junior year.

689
01:00:21,152 --> 01:00:28,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they will major out between the two because they will learn the lab skills that they need that intersect between the two standards.

690
01:00:28,715 --> 01:00:31,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

691
01:00:31,656 --> 01:00:37,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Superintendent, Madam Mayor, members of the committee, um, just to give you some reflection on the meeting that was held with the state,

692
01:00:39,343 --> 01:00:40,424
[SPEAKER_14]: One, it was a very full meeting.

693
01:00:40,444 --> 01:00:46,247
[SPEAKER_14]: There were people there, friends of the Fells were there, other people were there who were expert in the field of environmental science.

694
01:00:46,307 --> 01:00:59,013
[SPEAKER_14]: But what's really significant to us is that everyone was remarking that the high school, vocational school, is actually on the grounds of a very, very significant environmental science field.

695
01:00:59,433 --> 01:01:00,854
[SPEAKER_14]: The Fells is right behind the school.

696
01:01:01,734 --> 01:01:03,655
[SPEAKER_14]: You couldn't find a better laboratory.

697
01:01:04,439 --> 01:01:09,644
[SPEAKER_14]: than the outside of Medford High School with all the activities that are out there in the field.

698
01:01:10,164 --> 01:01:17,550
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were all remarking just how wonderful it is to have that geographic location in our midst.

699
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:18,011
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one.

700
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:24,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Second thing is in talking about students, a number of our students have gone to Minuteman for environmental science.

701
01:01:24,717 --> 01:01:26,038
[SPEAKER_14]: That will no longer be the case.

702
01:01:26,924 --> 01:01:35,907
[SPEAKER_14]: And that allows us to reinvest in ourselves, and it allows us to put the biotech and the environmental together, and to grow that program very, very significantly.

703
01:01:35,927 --> 01:01:39,908
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are two very, very significant things as a result of this movement.

704
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:47,731
[SPEAKER_14]: And we also have quite a few youngsters in the high school that have been very, very active in environmental science as well, and they'll be able to cross over.

705
01:01:48,331 --> 01:01:55,553
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of the discussions that have taken place between the headmaster and the director have been on the issues of sharing resources.

706
01:01:56,064 --> 01:02:04,514
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to see youngsters who are maybe not formally involved in environmental science as a chapter 74 program also be interested in taking advantage of that program too.

707
01:02:04,995 --> 01:02:08,398
[SPEAKER_14]: And the headmaster actually has a joint program with Tufts University underway right now.

708
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:12,583
[SPEAKER_14]: So environmental science is going to be a very, very exciting area.

709
01:02:12,663 --> 01:02:15,547
[SPEAKER_14]: The other day there was a young man, Daniel Powers,

710
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:18,269
[SPEAKER_14]: and his family there, incredibly impressive.

711
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:20,951
[SPEAKER_14]: His interest and how he got involved.

712
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:27,235
[SPEAKER_14]: We just have to bring some of these people down to every committee of the whole so you can actually hear the enthusiasm from the young people.

713
01:02:27,916 --> 01:02:33,280
[SPEAKER_14]: And so you can see it, maybe even go up into the science lab itself and see how they actually use the materials.

714
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:34,901
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really impressive.

715
01:02:34,941 --> 01:02:39,044
[SPEAKER_14]: It really is quite an exciting area, especially given the whole discussion of climate today.

716
01:02:39,144 --> 01:02:41,746
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an environment that's really significant.

717
01:02:42,186 --> 01:02:43,627
[SPEAKER_14]: And Alicia Hunt from the

718
01:02:44,879 --> 01:02:49,202
[SPEAKER_14]: City's offices were also very active and very interested in pursuing things as well.

719
01:02:49,222 --> 01:02:53,985
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're going to see a lot of integration between city and school on that as well.

720
01:02:54,265 --> 01:02:54,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

721
01:02:54,605 --> 01:03:10,455
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I just wanted to say, um, in regards to like the halftime position, Heidi, did you ever, um, cause I think if you can send in a critical waiver, like a shortage with the DSE, um, if you can't find anybody to fill like a certified position, you might be able to,

722
01:03:11,222 --> 01:03:18,489
[SPEAKER_16]: get a critical shortage waiver if he was going to go to full-time status without the license?

723
01:03:18,509 --> 01:03:23,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we would look at that for next school year when our sophomores become juniors.

724
01:03:23,194 --> 01:03:32,043
[SPEAKER_10]: We would actually, if we weren't able to find a license certified, we would actually meet with Superintendent Belson and talk about getting a critical waiver.

725
01:03:33,615 --> 01:03:39,778
[SPEAKER_10]: But you'll be able to see Daniel in the paper or read about him because a transcript is doing a story on our fish farm.

726
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:43,819
[SPEAKER_10]: So you should get it either tomorrow evening electronically or Thursday.

727
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:45,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

728
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:47,501
[SPEAKER_14]: We're growing tilapia, if you didn't know.

729
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:47,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

730
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:54,044
[SPEAKER_10]: They're very cute, but they'll be in culinary for their lunch break.

731
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:56,925
[SPEAKER_10]: They're cute right now, but when they grow.

732
01:03:57,561 --> 01:03:59,422
[SPEAKER_14]: The fish don't know it then.

733
01:03:59,442 --> 01:03:59,482
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

734
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:00,662
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't told them what their future is.

735
01:04:00,722 --> 01:04:01,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Head first.

736
01:04:01,222 --> 01:04:02,422
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you didn't name them.

737
01:04:02,642 --> 01:04:03,563
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you didn't name them.

738
01:04:05,503 --> 01:04:06,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Chiu.

739
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:10,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive and place on file the report on environmental science, chapter 74.

740
01:04:10,785 --> 01:04:12,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And you'll shoot us out an email?

741
01:04:12,945 --> 01:04:13,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

742
01:04:13,245 --> 01:04:13,846
[SPEAKER_09]: When you get approval?

743
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:14,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

744
01:04:14,466 --> 01:04:14,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good.

745
01:04:14,846 --> 01:04:15,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

746
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:16,486
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

747
01:04:16,826 --> 01:04:17,247
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

748
01:04:17,347 --> 01:04:18,007
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

749
01:04:18,227 --> 01:04:19,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

750
01:04:19,767 --> 01:04:23,608
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on dual enrollment at Bunker Hill Community College health assisting program.

751
01:04:23,968 --> 01:04:25,889
[SPEAKER_14]: So here's another vocational program.

752
01:04:26,356 --> 01:04:27,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Riccio will take you through it.

753
01:04:28,277 --> 01:04:29,717
[SPEAKER_14]: It's another exciting program.

754
01:04:30,177 --> 01:04:35,898
[SPEAKER_14]: You saw the other day about one of our students who was in this program.

755
01:04:36,479 --> 01:04:40,400
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's another exciting program that's really taking off.

756
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:47,942
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to leave that to Dr. Riccio to introduce our student and talk a little bit about the program.

757
01:04:48,662 --> 01:04:49,342
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

758
01:04:50,903 --> 01:04:51,583
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Catty.

759
01:04:51,623 --> 01:04:53,064
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, did you all meet Catty?

760
01:04:53,084 --> 01:04:54,645
[SPEAKER_10]: But we'll talk about her in just a sec.

761
01:04:55,945 --> 01:04:58,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Stand tight, next to me.

762
01:05:00,007 --> 01:05:01,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Next to me.

763
01:05:01,307 --> 01:05:01,387
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

764
01:05:01,488 --> 01:05:06,670
[SPEAKER_10]: So in 2014, last school year, we worked with the guidance department at the high school and Ms.

765
01:05:06,730 --> 01:05:11,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Jensen, the director of guidance, because we did not have a college and career placement

766
01:05:12,336 --> 01:05:14,298
[SPEAKER_10]: software system like the high school.

767
01:05:14,378 --> 01:05:22,504
[SPEAKER_10]: So we incorporated Naviance into our curriculum, but we also incorporated the advisory programming into our curriculum as well.

768
01:05:22,744 --> 01:05:39,136
[SPEAKER_10]: And we felt that that was important because what we found as a need is that many of our students were not taking the SATs or the PSATs or really realizing their full potential if they wanted to go on to post-secondary options, whether it was a two or four year university system.

769
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:58,949
[SPEAKER_10]: So out of that, we feel as though we're doing more strategic planning with our students, and we have articulation agreements already by nature of what we do as a vocational school in most of our programs with community colleges, but this is a special dual enrollment program for our health assisting students.

770
01:05:59,849 --> 01:06:07,393
[SPEAKER_10]: There are two other vocational schools, Somerville and Madison Park, that also have this dual enrollment program with Bunker Hill, but it's called STAND.

771
01:06:08,345 --> 01:06:17,352
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually have to take the accuplacer, be interviewed, and they had an induction ceremony just this past week with all of the other inductees.

772
01:06:17,812 --> 01:06:27,580
[SPEAKER_10]: We have three students that were awarded this opportunity for dual enrollment, which means that they don't pay any money as part of this dual enrollment program.

773
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:30,382
[SPEAKER_10]: And Keddie is one of them, Keddie Toussaint.

774
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:35,204
[SPEAKER_10]: who also happens to be in SkillsUSA and many other activities.

775
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:37,746
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Adriana and Layla.

776
01:06:38,507 --> 01:06:49,577
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I could just speak very briefly about Ketty, if you didn't read the story, is that Ketty came to us, she's probably one of the most American great stories, I think, right?

777
01:06:51,563 --> 01:06:54,264
[SPEAKER_10]: sure whether she wants to be or not.

778
01:06:55,305 --> 01:07:01,608
[SPEAKER_10]: She came here with her dad at the age of 10 from Haiti and left her mom at home.

779
01:07:01,628 --> 01:07:07,231
[SPEAKER_10]: And her dad and her parents just wanted her to have a better life for her.

780
01:07:07,752 --> 01:07:13,495
[SPEAKER_10]: And so she knew very little English when she came here, so she had a lot of different transitions in this world.

781
01:07:14,075 --> 01:07:19,302
[SPEAKER_10]: And she actually is number one at this time, because it's really neck and neck.

782
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:24,588
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now, she's number one in the class at the vocational school.

783
01:07:24,608 --> 01:07:25,910
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're very proud of her.

784
01:07:29,585 --> 01:07:31,426
[SPEAKER_10]: She always has a smile on her face, too.

785
01:07:32,527 --> 01:07:40,051
[SPEAKER_10]: She also participated in the Harvard Medical School, something that she came to us and applied for on her own.

786
01:07:40,451 --> 01:07:48,276
[SPEAKER_10]: And the letter of recommendation that she got from one of the doctors that presented to her was unbelievable.

787
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:53,259
[SPEAKER_10]: And it kind of brought a couple tears to my eyes, right, just a little bit.

788
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:54,599
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's pretty cool.

789
01:07:54,659 --> 01:07:58,902
[SPEAKER_10]: She's an incredible girl who just remember her face and her name.

790
01:07:59,467 --> 01:08:01,128
[SPEAKER_10]: because she will be famous someday.

791
01:08:01,228 --> 01:08:02,488
[SPEAKER_10]: And where did you get into college?

792
01:08:02,909 --> 01:08:07,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Massachusetts College of Pharmacy.

793
01:08:08,071 --> 01:08:10,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful.

794
01:08:10,752 --> 01:08:15,134
[SPEAKER_10]: So in your packet, you have a little descriptor of what STAND is and what it's all about.

795
01:08:15,234 --> 01:08:22,598
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're very proud of all of our students, obviously at the school, but the health assisting students for kind of embarking on this new endeavor.

796
01:08:22,618 --> 01:08:24,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

797
01:08:28,411 --> 01:08:32,778
[SPEAKER_07]: With this program, you take classes at Bunk Hill Community College, correct?

798
01:08:33,259 --> 01:08:33,960
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you get there?

799
01:08:34,942 --> 01:08:37,646
[SPEAKER_05]: My friend's, Adriana's mom plans on driving us there.

800
01:08:37,866 --> 01:08:39,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and is it during the school day?

801
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:41,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Tuesdays, it starts tomorrow.

802
01:08:42,555 --> 01:08:44,136
[SPEAKER_07]: And how many classes are you taking?

803
01:08:45,337 --> 01:08:52,701
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do you receive when you finish that program?

804
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:58,083
[SPEAKER_07]: So is that an LPN program?

805
01:08:58,143 --> 01:09:04,087
[SPEAKER_10]: So they have different content areas that they can choose, so depending on where their area of focus is.

806
01:09:05,131 --> 01:09:09,673
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that Bunker Hill is a two-year program that has an affiliation with UMass Boston.

807
01:09:09,973 --> 01:09:17,817
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you wanted to go for a four-year degree in nursing, that all your credits are then transferred from Bunker Hill onward.

808
01:09:18,698 --> 01:09:23,860
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a really great opportunity for a lot of our students.

809
01:09:24,163 --> 01:09:33,089
[SPEAKER_07]: not just in nursing, but in the imaging field as well, because, you know, with all the baby boomers coming to age, you're going to be taking care of them.

810
01:09:33,129 --> 01:09:35,650
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be plenty of people to do that for.

811
01:09:35,991 --> 01:09:37,692
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a really great opportunity.

812
01:09:37,732 --> 01:09:47,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so thrilled that Medford represented so well, and that your director has really initiated so many programs for the students at Alvo Vocational School.

813
01:09:47,998 --> 01:09:49,099
[SPEAKER_07]: I could not be prouder.

814
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:51,701
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wish you nothing but the best.

815
01:09:51,801 --> 01:09:53,922
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't wait to see you on graduation.

816
01:09:54,395 --> 01:09:59,716
[SPEAKER_10]: as number one.

817
01:10:02,217 --> 01:10:05,297
[SPEAKER_10]: You might have to have them both up there.

818
01:10:05,317 --> 01:10:07,918
[SPEAKER_05]: A tie is always good.

819
01:10:07,938 --> 01:10:09,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

820
01:10:11,258 --> 01:10:11,698
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in awe.

821
01:10:11,738 --> 01:10:13,059
[SPEAKER_05]: This is absolutely wonderful.

822
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:14,979
[SPEAKER_05]: This is absolutely wonderful.

823
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:20,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I guess I'm just looking at it, you know, since Bunker Hill has decided to help us out,

824
01:10:21,412 --> 01:10:26,414
[SPEAKER_05]: You are the pilot program of showing them what we have in students.

825
01:10:27,215 --> 01:10:33,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just hoping that the other schools that we have in the vicinity of Medford will see what a great opportunity this is.

826
01:10:34,018 --> 01:10:38,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope that they start opening up their doors and giving us the opportunity like this for their schools.

827
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:42,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm telling you, thank you for representing the city.

828
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:44,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

829
01:10:45,782 --> 01:10:51,110
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to say thank you also and congratulations to Katie, Adriana, and Lolanda.

830
01:10:51,711 --> 01:10:52,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

831
01:10:52,372 --> 01:10:52,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.

832
01:10:55,012 --> 01:10:57,853
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a motion on the floor to receive and place on file.

833
01:10:57,893 --> 01:10:58,513
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved by Ms.

834
01:10:58,573 --> 01:10:59,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Cugno.

835
01:10:59,093 --> 01:10:59,873
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

836
01:11:00,433 --> 01:11:01,114
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

837
01:11:01,154 --> 01:11:01,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

838
01:11:02,454 --> 01:11:04,475
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on Boston-Keyer's collaborative.

839
01:11:04,895 --> 01:11:05,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Riccio.

840
01:11:05,675 --> 01:11:10,876
[SPEAKER_14]: So once again, making a maiden appearance at the school committee, Dr. Heidi Riccio.

841
01:11:11,276 --> 01:11:12,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Just take a seat, Heidi.

842
01:11:13,337 --> 01:11:16,758
[SPEAKER_10]: I have nothing else going on in my world, so I just figured.

843
01:11:17,758 --> 01:11:18,498
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're not done yet.

844
01:11:18,518 --> 01:11:18,718
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

845
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:31,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Boston Cares is a voluntary organization where they seek out, or companies seek them out, and Boston Cares matches up different community service.

846
01:11:31,527 --> 01:11:40,133
[SPEAKER_10]: So many organizations now are requiring their employees to do so many hours of community service work over the course of the year.

847
01:11:40,944 --> 01:11:53,569
[SPEAKER_10]: Boston Pairs used to use the carpentry building in Dorchester, the union building in Dorchester, to help assemble or cut and prepare loft beds, toggle beds.

848
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:57,271
[SPEAKER_10]: And they grew out of that space.

849
01:11:57,511 --> 01:12:07,975
[SPEAKER_10]: So they contacted us thinking that it would be a nice partnership, community service farms, units, but also civic consciousness and awareness of what's going on in their surrounding communities.

850
01:12:08,822 --> 01:12:22,217
[SPEAKER_10]: And what happens is when somebody is homeless and they are given a home, in order to get the funding for that apartment, they have to prove that they have a bed for each child in which they have.

851
01:12:22,517 --> 01:12:27,984
[SPEAKER_10]: So in order for them to do that, we donate these parts of these common beds.

852
01:12:29,028 --> 01:12:31,709
[SPEAKER_10]: This particular project will be a reminder for King Day.

853
01:12:31,749 --> 01:12:38,072
[SPEAKER_10]: It probably started advertising on the news in Boston, where they had a variety of days of service.

854
01:12:38,112 --> 01:12:43,154
[SPEAKER_10]: That film company had actually started, but it's continuing to go at Boston Line.

855
01:12:44,054 --> 01:12:45,435
This particular project will look

856
01:12:54,468 --> 01:12:58,910
[SPEAKER_10]: Our students, what they did was they cut all of the parts.

857
01:12:59,771 --> 01:13:15,659
[SPEAKER_10]: They then shipped them out to the organization Boston Cares, and then Boston Cares distributed them to Boston Latin School for the volunteers to assemble and sand and paint these bookshelves to then go to families.

858
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:18,201
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is a new partnership that we have.

859
01:13:18,281 --> 01:13:21,562
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be making, these were 50 bookshelves that we made.

860
01:13:23,295 --> 01:13:34,240
[SPEAKER_10]: But over the course of the year, we will be making 500 bed frames or toddler bed kits, because they're really just kits in order for them.

861
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:37,861
[SPEAKER_10]: And some people may say, well, what does that have to do with carpentry?

862
01:13:37,921 --> 01:13:41,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's always something out of civic awareness as part of their curriculum.

863
01:13:41,763 --> 01:13:51,167
[SPEAKER_10]: But in addition to that, it's a great entry-level skill, because our carpentry students really have to practice cutting and measuring.

864
01:13:52,060 --> 01:13:53,661
[SPEAKER_10]: measure twice, cut once.

865
01:13:53,681 --> 01:13:55,943
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is the goal.

866
01:13:56,203 --> 01:14:07,452
[SPEAKER_10]: And so by the end of it, our grade nine and 10 students will have mastered that particular standard that's in their curriculum.

867
01:14:07,533 --> 01:14:08,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

868
01:14:08,173 --> 01:14:08,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

869
01:14:08,573 --> 01:14:10,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a question.

870
01:14:10,595 --> 01:14:18,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there any way that the children can actually go and see a house that one of the beds are being utilized in?

871
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:20,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Like at the end or at the beginning to help

872
01:14:21,177 --> 01:14:25,378
[SPEAKER_07]: them understand the impact that they're having on someone's life.

873
01:14:25,398 --> 01:14:36,582
[SPEAKER_10]: I left them leave only because they have a test tomorrow, but SkillsUSA is using this as their community service project.

874
01:14:39,463 --> 01:14:40,664
[SPEAKER_10]: She shut herself off.

875
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:43,185
[SPEAKER_10]: My husband does it all the time.

876
01:14:45,385 --> 01:14:48,747
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will be using this as a SkillsUSA community service project.

877
01:14:48,787 --> 01:14:54,429
[SPEAKER_10]: So they will actually be coordinating with Boston CARES carpentry students.

878
01:14:54,469 --> 01:14:57,070
[SPEAKER_10]: So they'll be doing the scheduling and the figuring out.

879
01:14:57,170 --> 01:14:58,731
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll be working with companies.

880
01:14:59,191 --> 01:15:00,692
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they'll also do the delivery.

881
01:15:01,548 --> 01:15:04,069
[SPEAKER_10]: So they'll see it from beginning to end.

882
01:15:04,089 --> 01:15:04,290
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes.

883
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:05,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Will they actually see the child?

884
01:15:06,151 --> 01:15:07,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Delivering to the home.

885
01:15:07,651 --> 01:15:07,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

886
01:15:08,232 --> 01:15:08,772
[SPEAKER_07]: And they'll get it.

887
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:09,973
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the intention.

888
01:15:10,033 --> 01:15:15,616
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes families are very proud, and they don't necessarily want individuals involved.

889
01:15:15,736 --> 01:15:19,518
[SPEAKER_10]: So depending on the privacy of those families, we would definitely respect that.

890
01:15:19,578 --> 01:15:21,019
[SPEAKER_10]: But that would be the intention.

891
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:27,823
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great, because I really feel like if you teach children community service at a young age,

892
01:15:28,666 --> 01:15:30,547
[SPEAKER_07]: They teach everybody they meet.

893
01:15:30,887 --> 01:15:31,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

894
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:34,628
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just becomes a better place to live for all of us.

895
01:15:35,028 --> 01:15:35,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

896
01:15:35,828 --> 01:15:36,829
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a great program.

897
01:15:37,229 --> 01:15:38,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

898
01:15:38,269 --> 01:15:38,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

899
01:15:38,349 --> 01:15:38,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Cuno.

900
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:51,033
[SPEAKER_05]: With all the bed frames that they need to make and the kids, I'm just curious in knowing, is it all going to be incorporated during the day during their academic, well, not their academic week, but the week that they're hands-on?

901
01:15:51,133 --> 01:15:54,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is this something that they're also going to be doing like after school?

902
01:15:55,094 --> 01:15:56,034
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a combination.

903
01:15:56,274 --> 01:16:04,997
[SPEAKER_10]: So there'll be the SkillsUSA students and we're actually going to be working with Dr. Preller at the high school for kids that want to do community service after school.

904
01:16:05,497 --> 01:16:08,978
[SPEAKER_10]: And those SkillsUSA students will be coordinating that part of it.

905
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:16,921
[SPEAKER_10]: So it will be students during their program time, but it's allotted program time because they can't really be cutting the entire day.

906
01:16:16,981 --> 01:16:17,981
[SPEAKER_10]: So it'll be very

907
01:16:18,981 --> 01:16:24,964
[SPEAKER_10]: specific times of the week that they will be doing it, and then it will be also performed after school.

908
01:16:27,305 --> 01:16:38,910
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great way of putting both sides together, and if there's any, you know, like sometimes, I know the National Honor Society has a lot of things going on, but not just to target particular groups, but to open it up to all students would be great.

909
01:16:39,711 --> 01:16:40,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

910
01:16:41,684 --> 01:16:43,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file?

911
01:16:43,986 --> 01:16:44,266
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

912
01:16:44,346 --> 01:16:46,008
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

913
01:16:46,608 --> 01:16:47,048
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

914
01:16:47,168 --> 01:16:48,289
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

915
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:50,291
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

916
01:16:50,331 --> 01:16:53,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on $75,000 grant for adult building trades program.

917
01:16:54,154 --> 01:17:02,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee, the day students are not the only people who are beneficiaries of the vocational school.

918
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:06,284
[SPEAKER_14]: There's more coming, so once again,

919
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:09,468
[SPEAKER_14]: making her first appearance, no, Dr. Heidi Richel.

920
01:17:10,408 --> 01:17:11,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

921
01:17:11,749 --> 01:17:19,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so we partnered, we're actually a partner in this grant, so the good news is we didn't have to write the entire thing.

922
01:17:20,092 --> 01:17:24,933
[SPEAKER_10]: We just had to present the curriculum and work with a variety of different partners.

923
01:17:25,053 --> 01:17:28,935
[SPEAKER_10]: You actually have all of the partners in the memorandum of understanding.

924
01:17:29,695 --> 01:17:35,857
[SPEAKER_10]: The grant in its entirety is $200,000, but what they do is they release, so the state releases

925
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:39,369
[SPEAKER_10]: specific funds at different times of this year.

926
01:17:39,389 --> 01:18:00,558
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's an 18-month grant where we will be training underemployed, unemployed, with a focus on females, Latinos, and English as second language adult students, including those that have recently become civilians and out of the military.

927
01:18:01,422 --> 01:18:05,524
[SPEAKER_10]: So it will be an evening school program as part of our adult education.

928
01:18:06,244 --> 01:18:14,227
[SPEAKER_10]: But our students, I always feel like our students will benefit because some of these participants may be parents of our children.

929
01:18:15,067 --> 01:18:22,210
[SPEAKER_10]: And they will reap the benefit of that because the goal is to make them employable after this six week training program.

930
01:18:23,378 --> 01:18:34,601
[SPEAKER_10]: And the union, our local 22, has been very supportive of this, but also different companies where they will actually give them first bid to apply for a position, a full-time employment position.

931
01:18:35,662 --> 01:18:37,982
[SPEAKER_09]: When will the six weeks begin, their program?

932
01:18:38,302 --> 01:18:39,783
[SPEAKER_10]: It is scheduled to start in May.

933
01:18:39,843 --> 01:18:40,203
[SPEAKER_10]: We just

934
01:18:40,585 --> 01:18:43,066
[SPEAKER_10]: did receive the funding last week.

935
01:18:43,186 --> 01:18:47,648
[SPEAKER_10]: So what happens now is now we look at it and really plan the curriculum.

936
01:18:48,409 --> 01:18:52,471
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have to post for an instructor, an evening instructor, obviously, for a carpentry.

937
01:18:52,511 --> 01:18:55,772
[SPEAKER_10]: But everything is paid for out of this funding.

938
01:18:55,893 --> 01:18:58,014
[SPEAKER_10]: So we don't necessarily get a check.

939
01:18:58,394 --> 01:19:04,697
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a little bit different than a grant that we would get and where we get a check and it's for equipment, et cetera.

940
01:19:05,152 --> 01:19:07,754
[SPEAKER_10]: This is specifically targeted for certain areas.

941
01:19:07,814 --> 01:19:19,204
[SPEAKER_10]: So it would be employment, the cost of the program, meaning the cost of equipment and maintenance and supplies and materials, but also the cost of the instructors to run the program.

942
01:19:20,425 --> 01:19:22,206
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

943
01:19:22,246 --> 01:19:23,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive in place on file.

944
01:19:24,028 --> 01:19:26,350
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to receive in place on file.

945
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:27,210
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

946
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:27,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

947
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:29,072
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

948
01:19:29,132 --> 01:19:29,812
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

949
01:19:29,913 --> 01:19:32,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for being here this evening and all these wonderful programs you've

950
01:19:35,022 --> 01:19:38,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Before she goes, I just want you to know there's more coming.

951
01:19:39,086 --> 01:19:47,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Heidi has a lot of spare time, so we've given her more things to do.

952
01:19:49,154 --> 01:19:59,842
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think what's really significant is on Friday, Heidi and I attended, along with Lisa Berube, who is our cooperative placement coordinator, attended a

953
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:06,424
[SPEAKER_14]: activity at the Federal Reserve Bank run by the Alliance for Vocational and Technical Education.

954
01:20:06,444 --> 01:20:22,515
[SPEAKER_14]: The featured speaker was the Governor, Secretaries of Education, Workforce Development and Labor, and Housing and Urban Development were all there along with representatives from around the state, Commissioner of Education and others.

955
01:20:23,476 --> 01:20:28,719
[SPEAKER_14]: And the whole purpose was to talk about how we're going to advance vocational education because obviously

956
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:39,328
[SPEAKER_14]: Vocational education provides a tremendous alternative for youngsters who want to go right into the workforce, or who want to go to college and develop their career after they acquire a skill.

957
01:20:40,309 --> 01:20:42,170
[SPEAKER_14]: And this was an outstanding meeting.

958
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:44,672
[SPEAKER_14]: We went over a lot of possibilities.

959
01:20:44,692 --> 01:20:47,795
[SPEAKER_14]: There's substantial money coming down from the state.

960
01:20:48,275 --> 01:20:49,176
[SPEAKER_14]: We're applying for it.

961
01:20:49,677 --> 01:20:56,903
[SPEAKER_14]: We've put together several partnerships, which you will hear about very soon, as soon as we get a little bit more go ahead to talk about them in public.

962
01:20:58,637 --> 01:21:09,259
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you're going to see some really exciting things coming out of the vocational school going forward, and out of the overall high school going forward with regard to vocational and skills-based education.

963
01:21:09,339 --> 01:21:13,740
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a lot going on in this area, a substantial amount of activity.

964
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:18,201
[SPEAKER_14]: And Heidi's been a tremendous addition to our administrative team.

965
01:21:18,781 --> 01:21:24,562
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if she sleeps, but she's producing work at a tremendous amount.

966
01:21:25,788 --> 01:21:26,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

967
01:21:26,268 --> 01:21:32,171
[SPEAKER_14]: She's got a short commute back to Salisbury, so she might get on the road.

968
01:21:34,231 --> 01:21:39,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Next report on kindergarten registration process for the school year 2016-17.

969
01:21:40,614 --> 01:21:44,295
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're providing you this information early at this point in time.

970
01:21:44,335 --> 01:21:50,558
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going out just yet, but we're going to start to alert people that kindergarten registration takes place.

971
01:21:50,618 --> 01:21:51,738
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's several reasons why.

972
01:21:52,839 --> 01:21:52,939
[SPEAKER_14]: One,

973
01:21:54,560 --> 01:22:01,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Charter schools in our area are recruiting quickly on kindergarten, and they have to have their enrollments in by March 1 to get their funding.

974
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:02,305
[SPEAKER_14]: That's to start with.

975
01:22:03,425 --> 01:22:10,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, we have situations in which some people are not sure of our kindergarten process, how to get there.

976
01:22:10,169 --> 01:22:13,551
[SPEAKER_14]: So we want to get people early, as early as we possibly can.

977
01:22:13,591 --> 01:22:14,932
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're giving you this information.

978
01:22:15,499 --> 01:22:21,742
[SPEAKER_14]: We're ramping up our public relations, ramping up our outreach to people, but the formal process won't start until a little bit later.

979
01:22:22,402 --> 01:22:34,929
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're making sure people get information, we're letting them know there's workshops coming, that there's opportunities to attend our schools, and that we have great class size, we have great other things going for us, and possibly other things that might come.

980
01:22:39,710 --> 01:22:51,554
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that it's kind of important that we get out front and let people know just how good our kindergartens are and things we're doing so that they don't opt for something besides us.

981
01:22:51,955 --> 01:22:55,916
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we pay that tuition through charter school or through some other activity.

982
01:22:56,585 --> 01:23:01,427
[SPEAKER_14]: So just to give you information of what's going out the door, it's on our webpage.

983
01:23:01,487 --> 01:23:06,268
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to keep promoting it and letting people know that the formal period will start a little bit later.

984
01:23:06,568 --> 01:23:09,969
[SPEAKER_14]: But pay attention, there's a lot going on in our kindergartens.

985
01:23:10,429 --> 01:23:11,290
[SPEAKER_05]: This is great.

986
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:14,470
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only thing that I want to ask about is that parents of preschoolers

987
01:23:23,205 --> 01:23:39,640
[SPEAKER_03]: had said it's difficult to learn the community or the culture, that information meetings are helpful, but it'd be almost nicer if they could go in during the school day to see a classroom in action where their child actually would be with the size, the teacher, the feel of the school.

988
01:23:40,141 --> 01:23:46,626
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to be careful that we don't disrupt the classes and create a revolving door, people coming and going.

989
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:50,189
[SPEAKER_14]: But let's see if we can't do something that would give people some access.

990
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:54,993
[SPEAKER_14]: If they request it or we tell them that if you're really unsure, maybe we can do it.

991
01:23:55,013 --> 01:23:56,954
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people are not unsure, they don't need that.

992
01:23:57,434 --> 01:23:58,455
[SPEAKER_14]: There may be some people that do.

993
01:23:59,056 --> 01:24:01,097
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a good suggestion, let's look into it.

994
01:24:02,485 --> 01:24:10,712
[SPEAKER_20]: Madam Mayor, at this though, it looks like the first opportunity is April 26th.

995
01:24:10,872 --> 01:24:12,814
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that?

996
01:24:13,434 --> 01:24:15,136
[SPEAKER_14]: First opportunity for, I'm sorry.

997
01:24:15,156 --> 01:24:19,199
[SPEAKER_20]: For, on the yellow flyer, building bridges to kindergarten.

998
01:24:23,483 --> 01:24:24,023
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, Ms.

999
01:24:24,063 --> 01:24:27,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Vandercook, that's the building bridges where Ms.

1000
01:24:27,566 --> 01:24:29,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Gross and Maria Michelli

1001
01:24:30,674 --> 01:24:38,079
[SPEAKER_02]: present at Medford High School, and then a week later, we usually rotate our kindergarten presentations.

1002
01:24:38,099 --> 01:24:39,820
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be at the Roberts Elementary School.

1003
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:40,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1004
01:24:40,720 --> 01:24:47,945
[SPEAKER_20]: So, again, when I heard parents talking, they were asking it for earlier because they were trying to make decisions.

1005
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:53,568
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, for me, April, that late in April actually feels late because they wanted it

1006
01:24:54,400 --> 01:25:05,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So if parents are trying to make a decision if they want to come to Medford Public Schools, they usually contact me or they can contact a principal and take a tour of the buildings, which is what Ms.

1007
01:25:05,907 --> 01:25:07,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Mastoni was alluding to.

1008
01:25:08,048 --> 01:25:18,815
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't like people to do the revolving door, walking in and out, but certainly principals can arrange to have parents observe a classroom earlier.

1009
01:25:19,215 --> 01:25:21,416
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just saying we can't do that session any earlier.

1010
01:25:21,436 --> 01:25:22,797
[SPEAKER_20]: We can't do another one earlier.

1011
01:25:24,178 --> 01:25:25,922
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure about that, but I can check for you.

1012
01:25:26,945 --> 01:25:28,107
[SPEAKER_14]: We can talk about it.

1013
01:25:30,837 --> 01:25:31,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

1014
01:25:31,777 --> 01:25:32,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1015
01:25:32,618 --> 01:25:49,183
[SPEAKER_07]: This brought to mind my request for what the cost, the report I requested last week, two weeks ago when we were here, about the cost increase to move our part-time kindergarten aides to full-time.

1016
01:25:49,544 --> 01:25:55,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this evening when I asked you about it, you gave me an approximate number.

1017
01:25:56,186 --> 01:25:57,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd really like a cost report.

1018
01:25:57,706 --> 01:25:58,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Pat just left, but

1019
01:25:59,727 --> 01:26:16,817
[SPEAKER_07]: a cost report, a budget of what it would look like if we were to change all of our part-time kindergarten age, especially based on the numbers that you gave us last school committee meeting about the class sizes in some of our kindergarten classrooms.

1020
01:26:17,538 --> 01:26:28,484
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually have an actual cost, but that cost will increase once the power negotiations and the kindergarten has completed because there were raises that are projected in that activity.

1021
01:26:29,029 --> 01:26:31,531
[SPEAKER_14]: But so we have a cost basis that we can give you.

1022
01:26:31,771 --> 01:26:32,812
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually did the chart.

1023
01:26:33,613 --> 01:26:34,494
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll provide it to you.

1024
01:26:34,574 --> 01:26:35,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Our next meeting is Monday.

1025
01:26:35,554 --> 01:26:36,195
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll send it to you.

1026
01:26:36,335 --> 01:26:38,657
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll scan it in and send it by email this week.

1027
01:26:39,558 --> 01:26:51,648
[SPEAKER_14]: As I indicated, it was initially $65,000 just simply to bring up nine people, plus another $143,000 that comes from the state grant if the state grant disappears.

1028
01:26:52,368 --> 01:26:56,872
[SPEAKER_14]: So we just need to know whether that's going to be there in the state budget.

1029
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:00,441
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll start to emerge very soon.

1030
01:27:00,461 --> 01:27:03,724
[SPEAKER_14]: The governor will release the state budget, his proposed budget sometime this week.

1031
01:27:04,364 --> 01:27:07,387
[SPEAKER_14]: The legislature will take the rest of the year to figure out what they want to do.

1032
01:27:08,047 --> 01:27:10,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably won't have a real budget till sometime in June from the state.

1033
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:15,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Usually they take all that time to come up with a budget.

1034
01:27:16,053 --> 01:27:23,359
[SPEAKER_14]: But we'll get a feel as to whether or not the kindergarten grants are going to be held in place or not held in place.

1035
01:27:23,379 --> 01:27:25,140
[SPEAKER_14]: And that will give us a truer picture.

1036
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,541
[SPEAKER_14]: But the initial cost is 65.

1037
01:27:29,207 --> 01:27:40,210
[SPEAKER_14]: There's another 20 that would have to be added to that, plus anything that we do with raises or increases in raises as a result of our bargaining.

1038
01:27:41,091 --> 01:27:43,831
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's our initial cost, but I'll give you a figure.

1039
01:27:43,911 --> 01:27:45,232
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll scan it and send it out to you by email.

1040
01:27:45,632 --> 01:27:55,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, as a follow-up too, I know that they're talking about looking at bigger preschool programs throughout the state of Massachusetts, and I'm sure in that conversation,

1041
01:27:56,529 --> 01:28:03,631
[SPEAKER_07]: that making sure that we have enough staffing for our K classes is also going to be important.

1042
01:28:03,651 --> 01:28:08,713
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't see them cutting the K budget and increasing a preschool program.

1043
01:28:09,013 --> 01:28:10,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't see it happening.

1044
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:19,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I'm meeting with some legislators this week, Thursday evening, and I'm going to discuss homeless transportation throughout the commonwealth with them.

1045
01:28:19,756 --> 01:28:22,018
[SPEAKER_07]: And the need for some changes in funding there.

1046
01:28:22,058 --> 01:28:29,804
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm also going to bring up this issue and tell them that the Medford Public Schools does offer kindergarten aides in our classroom.

1047
01:28:30,044 --> 01:28:43,634
[SPEAKER_07]: But because they're not totally funding what we need them to fund for our kindergarten rooms, we're not looking for any of our legislatures that represent the city of Medford to vote in a way that would hurt us from losing any funds.

1048
01:28:44,194 --> 01:28:49,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And I expect them to represent us in the way and manner that our children,

1049
01:28:49,678 --> 01:28:51,099
[SPEAKER_07]: need for them to do.

1050
01:28:51,559 --> 01:28:57,944
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's already on my agenda, and I don't want to dismiss this light item in next year's budget.

1051
01:28:58,004 --> 01:29:06,930
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been a priority of this committee for a few years now, and I want to let you know that this is something I'm going to be looking for in our budget for next year.

1052
01:29:07,710 --> 01:29:11,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just putting it out there, and I know there's a lot of committee members that feel the same way.

1053
01:29:11,692 --> 01:29:17,856
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been doing this for quite a few years now, and I'm just setting my goals.

1054
01:29:18,036 --> 01:29:23,559
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a goal for next year for the Metropolitan Schools as far as I'm concerned as a school committee member.

1055
01:29:24,059 --> 01:29:28,922
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, we certainly all agree that we'd like to do a lot of things.

1056
01:29:30,219 --> 01:29:32,300
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll prioritize it when the budget comes up.

1057
01:29:32,380 --> 01:29:33,941
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the way it's done.

1058
01:29:34,021 --> 01:29:36,163
[SPEAKER_14]: And there are many, many things that people want to do.

1059
01:29:36,903 --> 01:29:40,486
[SPEAKER_14]: And if this is a priority, and this is where you want to go, then we'll make it.

1060
01:29:41,146 --> 01:29:44,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Just paraphrase Heidi, you can look at it twice and never cut.

1061
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:49,852
[SPEAKER_14]: It took a little while, but everybody got it.

1062
01:29:49,952 --> 01:29:55,995
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll cut unnecessary programs to put that money back into kindergarten age, Mr. Jim, Mr. Superintendent.

1063
01:29:56,216 --> 01:29:58,077
[SPEAKER_14]: But clearly, you're going to have to look.

1064
01:29:58,633 --> 01:30:00,754
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to have to look at all the things that you'd like to see.

1065
01:30:01,474 --> 01:30:03,815
[SPEAKER_14]: And let me put it this way.

1066
01:30:04,596 --> 01:30:08,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Early childhood is clearly something we all support, early childhood education.

1067
01:30:09,518 --> 01:30:11,639
[SPEAKER_14]: But there has not been the funding behind it.

1068
01:30:12,239 --> 01:30:14,760
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been minimal across the state.

1069
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:19,422
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's something that Boston asked for, but the governor was uncommitted.

1070
01:30:19,722 --> 01:30:21,463
[SPEAKER_14]: And I doubt you'll see it in the governor's budget.

1071
01:30:22,163 --> 01:30:25,565
[SPEAKER_14]: So the question is, will the legislature rise up and put money in there?

1072
01:30:26,356 --> 01:30:30,578
[SPEAKER_14]: The House didn't last year and the Senate put it in and then the conference committee restored it.

1073
01:30:31,398 --> 01:30:33,759
[SPEAKER_14]: So we just have to be real.

1074
01:30:34,339 --> 01:30:35,560
[SPEAKER_14]: We certainly want to do things.

1075
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:38,341
[SPEAKER_14]: If this is your priority as a group, it'll be there.

1076
01:30:39,122 --> 01:30:41,002
[SPEAKER_14]: But I want to be realistic with you.

1077
01:30:41,022 --> 01:30:44,324
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to be pie in the sky and tell you there'll be other things that you may want also.

1078
01:30:45,024 --> 01:30:47,085
[SPEAKER_14]: And there has to be a balancing act that's going on.

1079
01:30:47,105 --> 01:30:50,366
[SPEAKER_14]: But if this is the thing you want, you'll get it in there and it'll be there.

1080
01:30:51,843 --> 01:30:53,445
[SPEAKER_14]: We're working towards it.

1081
01:30:53,505 --> 01:30:55,467
[SPEAKER_14]: We talk to people all the time about these things.

1082
01:30:55,487 --> 01:30:58,791
[SPEAKER_14]: You know that I'm a huge advocate for early childhood education.

1083
01:30:58,831 --> 01:31:05,679
[SPEAKER_14]: My problem is that I've got to make sure I get the resources to back it the way I'd like to back it and the way undoubtedly you'd like to back it.

1084
01:31:07,017 --> 01:31:20,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Burke, just to follow up, as a committee member, I am reaching out to state representatives to tell them how I feel as a representative of this community and how I expect them to vote when this does come up on the floor.

1085
01:31:21,023 --> 01:31:27,946
[SPEAKER_07]: So I encourage other members to either join me or to make their own phone calls to do that as well because I think that

1086
01:31:29,246 --> 01:31:33,851
[SPEAKER_07]: If they don't hear from us, they assume that this is fine, and this is not fine.

1087
01:31:34,812 --> 01:31:41,458
[SPEAKER_07]: The preschool and kindergarten and K through 2, that's the foundation of our education, just like a foundation of a house.

1088
01:31:41,498 --> 01:31:44,280
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't have a good foundation, the house will fall down.

1089
01:31:44,661 --> 01:31:49,025
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we need to start, and I know Matthew was one of the first full-time

1090
01:31:49,865 --> 01:31:52,567
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been the leaders in this area.

1091
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:56,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and I want to continue being a leader in that area, Mr. Belson.

1092
01:31:56,289 --> 01:32:02,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to stay on this for our budget meetings all the way through until we get this approved.

1093
01:32:03,173 --> 01:32:05,935
[SPEAKER_07]: And just wanted to give you a fear warning.

1094
01:32:05,955 --> 01:32:06,916
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not against it.

1095
01:32:06,976 --> 01:32:10,578
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sure that we understand that a budget is a balancing act.

1096
01:32:11,271 --> 01:32:13,792
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've got to keep a lot of things in mind as we go forward.

1097
01:32:13,832 --> 01:32:16,733
[SPEAKER_14]: And we don't know some of the other issues that will or won't come at us.

1098
01:32:17,374 --> 01:32:19,775
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't want to just say, sure, we'll do anything you want.

1099
01:32:19,795 --> 01:32:23,356
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to be realistic with you and tell you that you're going to look at a lot of things.

1100
01:32:24,056 --> 01:32:25,157
[SPEAKER_14]: And you've got to make some decisions.

1101
01:32:25,177 --> 01:32:27,038
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got a growing EOL population.

1102
01:32:27,118 --> 01:32:31,419
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got a lot of other things going on in our world that will require your attention.

1103
01:32:32,180 --> 01:32:35,621
[SPEAKER_14]: And it may be that you need to balance that off a little bit.

1104
01:32:35,661 --> 01:32:39,703
[SPEAKER_14]: But let's put it on our plate as something that's a priority that you want to see.

1105
01:32:40,353 --> 01:32:42,934
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's see if we can't do it.

1106
01:32:43,494 --> 01:32:43,974
[SPEAKER_20]: Mayor Burke.

1107
01:32:44,474 --> 01:32:50,935
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I was wondering if perhaps what we might do is invite our, uh, legislators to our meeting.

1108
01:32:51,295 --> 01:32:57,897
[SPEAKER_20]: We always have to be careful to avoid, um, uh, not having the open meeting law honored.

1109
01:32:58,457 --> 01:33:02,297
[SPEAKER_20]: And so all of us might like to go on Thursday night, but we can't because of the open meeting law.

1110
01:33:02,938 --> 01:33:04,898
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, and so perhaps, uh,

1111
01:33:05,803 --> 01:33:17,851
[SPEAKER_20]: As a follow up, it would make a whole lot of sense to sit down with our legislators as a committee and follow up on those items which are important, not just to one member, but to all of us.

1112
01:33:18,451 --> 01:33:19,271
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a good idea.

1113
01:33:19,291 --> 01:33:29,458
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the suggestion is one in which once the governor puts his budget out, we then can see what the governor's proposing and where the gaps are, educationally, that we see.

1114
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:36,002
[SPEAKER_14]: and then give our legislators some guidance as to what we think needs to go back in.

1115
01:33:36,022 --> 01:33:50,607
[SPEAKER_14]: The governor has indicated he plans to increase the amount of money to education, but increasing the amount of money to education is kind of, well, it takes a little interpretation.

1116
01:33:51,027 --> 01:33:58,089
[SPEAKER_14]: By that I mean, just because you add more money, when you get through distributing it across 351 cities and towns, it doesn't add up to a lot.

1117
01:33:58,969 --> 01:34:00,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so you've really got to understand

1118
01:34:00,908 --> 01:34:06,274
[SPEAKER_14]: Plus the fact that they increased one account and then take money from, let's say, the circuit breaker or some other place.

1119
01:34:06,294 --> 01:34:12,761
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, last year we were net, net at a loss from state aid.

1120
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:13,867
[SPEAKER_14]: in that regard.

1121
01:34:13,907 --> 01:34:16,628
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's not, you know, that's something we've got to be very careful about.

1122
01:34:16,748 --> 01:34:27,712
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think I'd like to put that in the form of a motion that we have a set up a meeting with our legislators so that the committee as a whole can sit down and speak with them about our concerns.

1123
01:34:28,432 --> 01:34:29,893
[SPEAKER_20]: Just one follow up to your thought.

1124
01:34:30,293 --> 01:34:36,875
[SPEAKER_20]: Of course, the governor also has a strong liking of charter schools, which is difficult for us.

1125
01:34:37,395 --> 01:34:41,817
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that's extremely important that we're always making the distinction of an

1126
01:34:42,770 --> 01:34:48,396
[SPEAKER_20]: and explaining our concerns, why that's problematical for the public school system.

1127
01:34:48,436 --> 01:35:02,973
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think we stand, you know, to really say these are our strengths, look what we're doing here, look what our vocational school is, look at our class sizes, look what we're doing, because this, you know, when you listen to the charter school proponents,

1128
01:35:03,456 --> 01:35:08,520
[SPEAKER_20]: While, of course, there were some charter schools that perhaps are strong, they certainly are not.

1129
01:35:08,781 --> 01:35:16,628
[SPEAKER_20]: And I believe that is the cornerstone of the great values of this country is public education for all kids.

1130
01:35:16,908 --> 01:35:21,232
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't define that as having a dual system of education.

1131
01:35:21,252 --> 01:35:23,954
[SPEAKER_14]: I plan to give Secretary Clark's report next week.

1132
01:35:24,307 --> 01:35:25,408
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a point of clarification.

1133
01:35:25,428 --> 01:35:30,711
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion on the floor for committee of the whole to invite our state delegation so they could hear our priorities.

1134
01:35:30,931 --> 01:35:32,452
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a second on the floor as well.

1135
01:35:32,472 --> 01:35:40,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Just an amendment to that, which is to make sure that we have the opportunity of sitting down first with the priorities that we want to do.

1136
01:35:40,778 --> 01:35:46,522
[SPEAKER_05]: So as our meetings come up, we're going to be having all our budget meetings with all our different directors.

1137
01:35:47,002 --> 01:36:06,796
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be a good idea maybe just to hold off a little bit on just this one topic and make sure that we have a list of everything that we want to talk about because it's something that I know I'm sure all of us have had these conversations with our representatives and our senator and we continue on fighting for these things but I think it would be a good idea maybe to sit down

1138
01:36:07,496 --> 01:36:11,239
[SPEAKER_05]: not just with one particular item, but maybe with a few things that we have.

1139
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:14,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And after the governor's budget is looked into.

1140
01:36:14,242 --> 01:36:18,205
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got to get a handle on what's coming out of the statehouse before you start to move.

1141
01:36:19,686 --> 01:36:22,088
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion, I'm going to get a clarification.

1142
01:36:22,609 --> 01:36:25,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Just so you're aware, charter schools are public schools.

1143
01:36:26,372 --> 01:36:27,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.

1144
01:36:27,172 --> 01:36:30,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So you just can't say that, though, because a lot of people don't understand that.

1145
01:36:30,995 --> 01:36:33,697
[SPEAKER_20]: So charter schools are public schools.

1146
01:36:34,098 --> 01:36:36,580
[SPEAKER_20]: I also noted it was a dual system of education.

1147
01:36:37,267 --> 01:36:41,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said in previous meetings and things like that, you'll get a report next week.

1148
01:36:42,572 --> 01:36:44,974
[SPEAKER_14]: There are many fine charter schools and they do a good job.

1149
01:36:45,494 --> 01:36:50,038
[SPEAKER_14]: And there are some that are not as good and perhaps need some correction.

1150
01:36:51,739 --> 01:36:53,501
[SPEAKER_14]: So we don't use a blanket.

1151
01:36:54,321 --> 01:37:01,087
[SPEAKER_14]: The biggest issues with charter schools, and I think the Senate has taken a very interesting position under President Rosenberg's leadership.

1152
01:37:02,155 --> 01:37:07,819
[SPEAKER_14]: that they want a more comprehensive look at the charter school question than just simply an up or down on the cap lift.

1153
01:37:08,899 --> 01:37:20,846
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're going to see some things coming out of there that will look at enrollment, wait lists, funding, and things as well, rather than just simply say there's demand.

1154
01:37:21,407 --> 01:37:26,249
[SPEAKER_14]: The state auditor has continuously come out and said the wait list is not real.

1155
01:37:27,390 --> 01:37:30,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Although the proponents have said the wait list is real.

1156
01:37:31,355 --> 01:37:36,797
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I'm going to hang my hat with the state auditor on this one, because I know how the wait list is generated.

1157
01:37:37,638 --> 01:37:43,760
[SPEAKER_14]: And there are youngsters on that wait list who signed up 10 years ago and are still on it, and have long since been out of the program.

1158
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:48,822
[SPEAKER_14]: So there needs to be a significant amount of discussion on this area.

1159
01:37:49,803 --> 01:37:53,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's not, you met Barish last week, you attended our management meeting.

1160
01:37:53,824 --> 01:37:59,707
[SPEAKER_14]: Barish is my intern, if you will, from, who is the director of the Pioneer Charter School in Everett.

1161
01:38:00,370 --> 01:38:03,711
[SPEAKER_14]: So he sat in our management meeting today, and we went over stuff, and we traded ideas.

1162
01:38:04,411 --> 01:38:09,493
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a good dialogue that can happen between a charter school and the traditional public school.

1163
01:38:10,313 --> 01:38:11,793
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that they're all enemies.

1164
01:38:11,833 --> 01:38:12,894
[SPEAKER_14]: We work together.

1165
01:38:12,914 --> 01:38:15,354
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I've given him stuff, and other people have given people stuff.

1166
01:38:15,834 --> 01:38:27,658
[SPEAKER_14]: But how we fund them, who they serve, what they require from us, or how they drive the educational programs, all are fertile subjects for discussion.

1167
01:38:29,756 --> 01:38:30,857
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion, authored by Ms.

1168
01:38:30,937 --> 01:38:31,537
[SPEAKER_09]: Vander Kloof.

1169
01:38:31,697 --> 01:38:32,518
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1170
01:38:32,798 --> 01:38:33,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1171
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:33,918
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1172
01:38:33,938 --> 01:38:34,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1173
01:38:34,919 --> 01:38:37,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to receive and place on file this report.

1174
01:38:37,701 --> 01:38:38,381
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1175
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:38,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1176
01:38:39,101 --> 01:38:39,722
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1177
01:38:39,822 --> 01:38:40,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1178
01:38:41,483 --> 01:38:46,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on middle school selection process, school year 2016-17, Mr. Superintendent.

1179
01:38:46,526 --> 01:38:50,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, like the issue of the kindergarten, we're all early.

1180
01:38:50,956 --> 01:38:55,879
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to, this is going out in February, but we're letting people know now to start thinking about it.

1181
01:38:56,379 --> 01:38:57,740
[SPEAKER_14]: We put it on our website.

1182
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:00,722
[SPEAKER_14]: We've given people information informally.

1183
01:39:01,427 --> 01:39:03,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I told you last week, and the same thing is true with the kindergartens.

1184
01:39:03,809 --> 01:39:04,989
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going down to the schools.

1185
01:39:05,009 --> 01:39:14,035
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm working out a schedule now with principals to talk to parent groups and the like to promote the schools, and at the same time, help people make these selection decisions.

1186
01:39:14,676 --> 01:39:20,479
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the things that happened in the past is some people would claim they never got the information, they didn't hear about it.

1187
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:29,505
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to make sure everybody hears about it, or there's a sufficient amount of information out there so that if they didn't hear about it, you must have missed it by not listening.

1188
01:39:30,193 --> 01:39:39,481
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, there's obviously, you know, the possibility that somebody wouldn't hear about it, but if we go to the wall and let people know, it really is highly unlikely.

1189
01:39:40,101 --> 01:39:49,389
[SPEAKER_14]: What I don't want to have in a situation where somebody says, well, I really wanted to go here, and you put me here, and I didn't know, you lost my paperwork, all those kinds of things.

1190
01:39:52,293 --> 01:39:54,975
[SPEAKER_14]: We're pretty good about tracking what people send us.

1191
01:39:55,496 --> 01:39:56,397
[SPEAKER_14]: So we want to get it out.

1192
01:39:56,417 --> 01:39:57,678
[SPEAKER_14]: We want to show you what we're doing.

1193
01:39:58,558 --> 01:40:02,562
[SPEAKER_14]: There are certain issues with regard to specialized classes in certain areas.

1194
01:40:02,882 --> 01:40:08,327
[SPEAKER_14]: We're looking to balance those off because obviously some youngsters are more challenging than others.

1195
01:40:09,315 --> 01:40:15,498
[SPEAKER_14]: And we want to make sure that each school has a fair chance to meet the needs of every student that goes there.

1196
01:40:15,518 --> 01:40:17,339
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is informational for you.

1197
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:21,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, like the kindergarten piece, it's an attempt to try and give you advanced information.

1198
01:40:22,262 --> 01:40:32,147
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so we're going to call upon our Deputy Superintendent to tell you about our academic support program.

1199
01:40:32,687 --> 01:40:33,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1200
01:40:39,437 --> 01:40:45,740
[SPEAKER_15]: Every year, the Metropolitan Public Schools is eligible for a state grant that's called the Academic Support Grant.

1201
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:51,743
[SPEAKER_15]: This grant funds programs designed to prepare students to take the state-mandated test.

1202
01:40:52,143 --> 01:40:58,826
[SPEAKER_15]: And as you all know, since 1998, that has been the MCAS, the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System.

1203
01:41:00,207 --> 01:41:06,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Originally, when we first started getting this grant, which was about 15 years ago, it was intended for all grade levels.

1204
01:41:07,092 --> 01:41:17,774
[SPEAKER_15]: And then as the money became less and less, the state only allowed us to target students who would be taking the high school exams, the high stakes exams.

1205
01:41:19,494 --> 01:41:22,955
[SPEAKER_15]: We have been able throughout the years to offer many programs.

1206
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:26,555
[SPEAKER_15]: We offer the programs during the school year and in the summer.

1207
01:41:27,396 --> 01:41:33,677
[SPEAKER_15]: They are free of charge, but according to the grant guidelines, can only serve students who are eligible.

1208
01:41:33,877 --> 01:41:35,617
[SPEAKER_15]: And eligibility is based upon

1209
01:41:36,435 --> 01:41:43,718
[SPEAKER_15]: past performance on MCAS, if students are in needs improvement or warning categories, they are eligible for the programs.

1210
01:41:45,459 --> 01:42:04,008
[SPEAKER_15]: We offer many different programs with the grant money, and just to give you a sampling of them, we have tutorial programs for those students who have not passed the high school exam, who want to take the retests, and the retests are in English, mathematics, and science.

1211
01:42:04,588 --> 01:42:07,330
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have tutorial programs to help those students.

1212
01:42:08,311 --> 01:42:19,178
[SPEAKER_15]: We offer after school programs and Saturday programs, which are just getting started for students who are in grade 10, who will be taking the English and math test this spring.

1213
01:42:19,658 --> 01:42:25,763
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, for grade 10 youngsters, it will still be the regular MCAS exam this spring.

1214
01:42:26,423 --> 01:42:27,844
[SPEAKER_15]: We offer those programs.

1215
01:42:28,084 --> 01:42:30,086
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, we've been doing this for a number of years.

1216
01:42:30,106 --> 01:42:33,588
[SPEAKER_15]: So we kind of have a formula for what works and what doesn't work.

1217
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:41,416
[SPEAKER_15]: We find some youngsters like to come after school, others can't come after school, so we offer programs on Saturday as well.

1218
01:42:41,816 --> 01:42:47,621
[SPEAKER_15]: So we try to make it as comprehensive as possible so we can get as many youngsters in as we can.

1219
01:42:48,842 --> 01:42:56,148
[SPEAKER_15]: We also have had online preparation programs for the science MCAS exam and biology retests.

1220
01:42:57,028 --> 01:43:00,171
[SPEAKER_15]: And then a few years ago, we started a very successful program.

1221
01:43:00,191 --> 01:43:02,813
[SPEAKER_15]: It was really targeted in the summer.

1222
01:43:03,381 --> 01:43:06,283
[SPEAKER_15]: eighth graders who were coming into the high school as ninth graders.

1223
01:43:06,883 --> 01:43:12,786
[SPEAKER_15]: And these students would meet in late August and they all had summer work to do in English and mathematics.

1224
01:43:12,886 --> 01:43:20,391
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we would have teachers working with them, finishing up their summer assignments, kind of giving them a jumpstart into the school year.

1225
01:43:21,031 --> 01:43:24,673
[SPEAKER_15]: And this program would actually finish with the high school orientation day.

1226
01:43:24,693 --> 01:43:32,818
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was a really a nice transition, got the kids in the week before school began and actually worked with them until the beginning of the school year.

1227
01:43:34,607 --> 01:43:44,029
[SPEAKER_15]: We find that all programs have been proven to be very successful in helping students meet that high-stakes exam in English, mathematics, and science.

1228
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:52,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Curriculums and materials are prepared by our directors, and our faculty, for the most part, teaches in all of the programs.

1229
01:43:53,912 --> 01:43:58,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, no surprise, every year the money has been reduced.

1230
01:43:59,033 --> 01:44:00,253
[SPEAKER_15]: This year we only have $15,300,

1231
01:44:02,758 --> 01:44:06,180
[SPEAKER_15]: which is a reduction of over $7,000 from last year.

1232
01:44:06,881 --> 01:44:11,884
[SPEAKER_15]: And just to give a comparison, a couple of years ago in 2012, we did receive over $34,000.

1233
01:44:12,345 --> 01:44:15,827
[SPEAKER_15]: So it has been decreased, but we're very creative.

1234
01:44:16,528 --> 01:44:24,573
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, I know last year, High School 101 was so popular that we did sustain it with our regular budget because we didn't want to let that program go.

1235
01:44:26,395 --> 01:44:29,076
[SPEAKER_15]: The program is a collaborative effort.

1236
01:44:29,136 --> 01:44:31,178
[SPEAKER_15]: We have Assistant Principal David Blau,

1237
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:34,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Director of Mathematics and Science, Carolyn Joy.

1238
01:44:34,892 --> 01:44:36,893
[SPEAKER_15]: Director of Humanities, Nicole Chiesa.

1239
01:44:37,353 --> 01:44:40,515
[SPEAKER_15]: And Coordinator of Science, Rocco Sieri and Bernadette Riccadeli.

1240
01:44:40,956 --> 01:44:51,362
[SPEAKER_15]: We meet, we put together the materials, we send letters out to parents and guardians, inviting them to have their children belong.

1241
01:44:52,583 --> 01:44:56,545
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're very excited this year about our new eighth grade program.

1242
01:44:56,585 --> 01:44:59,367
[SPEAKER_15]: We are allowed under the grant guidelines to

1243
01:45:00,072 --> 01:45:07,938
[SPEAKER_15]: run a new program, and this is particularly important, we feel, in light of the fact that our eighth graders are taking a new test, the PARCC exam.

1244
01:45:08,618 --> 01:45:12,701
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're putting together a program, both for English and Mathematics.

1245
01:45:13,362 --> 01:45:15,924
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to start, I believe, in March.

1246
01:45:16,704 --> 01:45:22,589
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be on Saturday mornings, six Saturday mornings, and again, letters will go out to families.

1247
01:45:23,489 --> 01:45:27,112
[SPEAKER_15]: We do send a lot of letters out, and sometimes the response

1248
01:45:27,642 --> 01:45:28,723
[SPEAKER_15]: isn't all what it should be.

1249
01:45:28,883 --> 01:45:31,924
[SPEAKER_15]: So we do encourage parents to really respond.

1250
01:45:31,964 --> 01:45:33,285
[SPEAKER_15]: They can do it by email.

1251
01:45:34,005 --> 01:45:37,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Once we send letters out, we have a deadline for responding.

1252
01:45:37,587 --> 01:45:38,528
[SPEAKER_15]: We make calls.

1253
01:45:38,828 --> 01:45:42,790
[SPEAKER_15]: We really do our utmost to get these children into the programs.

1254
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:50,954
[SPEAKER_15]: We know the data supports the fact that the students that go to these programs do well and these programs are helping them a great deal.

1255
01:45:51,034 --> 01:45:52,495
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, it's always a,

1256
01:45:53,335 --> 01:45:57,999
[SPEAKER_15]: know, a challenge to get the right kids into the programs, but again, we do everything we can.

1257
01:45:58,059 --> 01:46:06,125
[SPEAKER_15]: We try to make it easy for families to notify us by email when the children are coming to the programs, and again, we do encourage that participation.

1258
01:46:07,426 --> 01:46:18,335
[SPEAKER_15]: All the programs are coordinated, again, with all the directors through my office, and again, we have attached some copies of the letters that go out to parents on some of the programs.

1259
01:46:18,975 --> 01:46:19,836
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, these

1260
01:46:20,215 --> 01:46:26,197
[SPEAKER_15]: The programs pretty much last all year, because the November retest start, I'm sorry, the first retest start in November.

1261
01:46:26,277 --> 01:46:35,261
[SPEAKER_15]: So we go to work right away in September, getting ready for the tutorials, and then we work our way into the prep season, and then we continue on through the summer.

1262
01:46:35,601 --> 01:46:41,443
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a very comprehensive effort, and again, we hope the money is still sustained.

1263
01:46:41,483 --> 01:46:44,604
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd like more of it, but we do the best with what we have.

1264
01:46:45,104 --> 01:46:45,785
[SPEAKER_15]: So any questions?

1265
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:47,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

1266
01:46:47,900 --> 01:46:48,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1267
01:46:48,701 --> 01:46:55,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, first of all, I think it's great that we offer that and I applaud your creativity to be able to keep offering this.

1268
01:46:55,925 --> 01:47:00,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really glad to see these programs being offered to our eighth grade students, especially with the park coming.

1269
01:47:01,508 --> 01:47:10,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I think it's a tremendous, how many students do you think that will be receiving letters for, um, the prep program prior to the park?

1270
01:47:12,214 --> 01:47:13,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have the exact number.

1271
01:47:13,675 --> 01:47:23,641
[SPEAKER_15]: We basically are allowed by the grant to invite all those students who have scored on previous MCAS exams in either wanting or needs improvement.

1272
01:47:24,782 --> 01:47:31,205
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, we can serve students who are new to the district that teachers have identified as being challenged academically.

1273
01:47:31,225 --> 01:47:40,471
[SPEAKER_15]: I will say, it depends upon the program, that as we became more creative and we offered programs on Saturdays,

1274
01:47:40,898 --> 01:47:42,660
[SPEAKER_15]: the participation became stronger.

1275
01:47:43,801 --> 01:47:47,624
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say probably a third of all students invited come.

1276
01:47:48,344 --> 01:47:51,507
[SPEAKER_15]: High school 101 was almost 95% came.

1277
01:47:51,527 --> 01:47:53,249
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a very popular program.

1278
01:47:53,829 --> 01:47:58,013
[SPEAKER_15]: The tutorials, those kids who really want to get their diplomas, they all come.

1279
01:47:58,493 --> 01:48:00,455
[SPEAKER_15]: So it really is dependent upon the program.

1280
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:03,437
[SPEAKER_15]: But we send out hundreds of letters, hundreds of letters every year.

1281
01:48:03,838 --> 01:48:05,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I have another question.

1282
01:48:05,609 --> 01:48:15,196
[SPEAKER_07]: So sometimes families travel during breaks and they can't get their children there on Saturdays and other things going on.

1283
01:48:15,896 --> 01:48:19,079
[SPEAKER_07]: So is there any way we could provide an online program?

1284
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:27,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it would take a while in development, but if we had that to offer, like if someone needed to take one of these programs.

1285
01:48:27,345 --> 01:48:32,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that some of our teachers in the past created online classes.

1286
01:48:34,165 --> 01:48:46,133
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if anybody would be interested in trying to do this program in an online capacity so we could reach more students and have more participation and really make sure our students are prepared for these exams.

1287
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:52,637
[SPEAKER_15]: We did have the online biology retest a few years back.

1288
01:48:53,738 --> 01:49:00,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, as we move forward, I think you're kind of reading my mind on this, because as money becomes tighter and tighter, we have to become creative.

1289
01:49:00,903 --> 01:49:03,605
[SPEAKER_15]: And my feeling next year is to write the grant

1290
01:49:04,199 --> 01:49:14,627
[SPEAKER_15]: to offer more online, because I think you're right, that families, children, transportation's always an issue, and that would circumvent those issues if we were to do that.

1291
01:49:14,688 --> 01:49:21,453
[SPEAKER_15]: So if the money, again, continues to be as scarce as it is, then I think that's the avenue we'll go, definitely.

1292
01:49:21,653 --> 01:49:33,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if there's like a tutorial, and this week you work on this, and you do the homework, and even if there's online chat time with a teacher, then, you know, like if you have a question, I really don't understand this math concept,

1293
01:49:34,763 --> 01:49:40,265
[SPEAKER_07]: And you could still meet and talk to a teacher, but you don't have to be present in the building.

1294
01:49:40,686 --> 01:49:48,168
[SPEAKER_07]: It might get more people invested, and that's how learning is really moving towards.

1295
01:49:49,409 --> 01:50:02,454
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, if we could offer it in this way to help remediate any kind of lapse in education, you know, like certain goals, then I think it's something great to look into.

1296
01:50:03,083 --> 01:50:04,344
[SPEAKER_07]: through you to the superintendent.

1297
01:50:04,424 --> 01:50:19,931
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the superintendent started an online blog and he was using more technical skills and this is a great opportunity to pilot like learning to be more used through the internet, through online programming.

1298
01:50:19,951 --> 01:50:22,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we're looking at that at some of our

1299
01:50:24,115 --> 01:50:35,140
[SPEAKER_07]: the Curtis Huff School as well for students that can't actually get into the building, but they could still get to their curriculum and still meet their educational requirements to graduate.

1300
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:37,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we started to look at that.

1301
01:50:37,241 --> 01:50:45,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you look into this and see if there's a way, not only with this program, with the other programs, and give us an update of how we're moving forward with that?

1302
01:50:46,685 --> 01:50:51,047
[SPEAKER_14]: It's our intent to talk to you extensively about technology.

1303
01:50:51,969 --> 01:50:55,412
[SPEAKER_14]: and the implementation of technology-based programs, including online.

1304
01:50:56,552 --> 01:51:04,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, as we move into the future, our technology has to be very robust, very dependable, very reliable.

1305
01:51:05,219 --> 01:51:09,101
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a major discussion on that today, on how we can do that.

1306
01:51:10,642 --> 01:51:17,587
[SPEAKER_14]: And we need to make sure that as we add more and more requirements and demands on that technology system, that it can hold up.

1307
01:51:18,448 --> 01:51:20,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only that, I'm talking more about

1308
01:51:21,447 --> 01:51:27,654
[SPEAKER_14]: teaching classes, like having... Right, but it's the same system, it's the same network, it's the same bandwidth.

1309
01:51:27,854 --> 01:51:35,882
[SPEAKER_07]: But also creating the class and what's involved in that and how we're going to give teachers time to create these classes.

1310
01:51:37,165 --> 01:51:41,689
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great for me to say, oh, this would be great if this was online and the teacher taught it online.

1311
01:51:41,729 --> 01:51:46,652
[SPEAKER_07]: But that takes time to create that curriculum and to put it in that format for the children.

1312
01:51:46,692 --> 01:51:55,379
[SPEAKER_07]: So not only the technology piece, but how we're encouraging our teachers to use that in their classrooms and outside of their classrooms to teach our children.

1313
01:51:55,699 --> 01:52:04,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really where I want to know where Method is moving in the future for this, because that's how I see education really happening in the next 10 years.

1314
01:52:04,647 --> 01:52:27,431
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess what I'm trying to tell you is that we will be coming forward to you with some significant technology recommendations that will enable us to do a lot of things that right now I would consider to be difficult in terms of reliability and dependability because of the networks and all the other demands on the system.

1315
01:52:27,991 --> 01:52:29,531
[SPEAKER_14]: And also what we ask teachers to do.

1316
01:52:30,051 --> 01:52:33,832
[SPEAKER_14]: So that you're going to see quite a bit coming forward.

1317
01:52:34,215 --> 01:52:37,077
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it is the wave of the future that we have to have these things.

1318
01:52:37,618 --> 01:52:39,940
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's not going to replace a lot of other things we have to do.

1319
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:46,885
[SPEAKER_14]: And we still have to have face-to-face contact with youngsters, because there are a lot of youngsters who, even given the time to do things online, won't do it.

1320
01:52:48,106 --> 01:52:50,868
[SPEAKER_14]: And we need to make sure we have a blend.

1321
01:52:51,409 --> 01:52:53,350
[SPEAKER_14]: But you're going to see quite a bit coming forward.

1322
01:52:53,791 --> 01:53:02,998
[SPEAKER_14]: And I suspect that, as the mayor works on capital improvements as one of her priorities, that you'll see us making some recommendations on capital.

1323
01:53:03,692 --> 01:53:05,894
[SPEAKER_14]: that will be part of that.

1324
01:53:06,834 --> 01:53:11,278
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm thinking maybe, you know how we bought the Chromebooks and stuff like that?

1325
01:53:11,778 --> 01:53:31,393
[SPEAKER_07]: So for a class similar to this, if we could maybe look forward to maybe next year offering it to some of our eighth graders in that way, and it be a pilot program, and how does it work, and did they do the work, and seeing how ready we are or not ready we are to proceed with bigger

1326
01:53:32,490 --> 01:53:35,011
[SPEAKER_07]: online teaching and type things.

1327
01:53:35,691 --> 01:53:43,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to see us at least pilot some type of class in that, in that, like maybe we need to have a curriculum meeting and subcommittee meeting.

1328
01:53:43,675 --> 01:53:50,498
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we have, we have piloted, you know, we have done this, but there are issues associated with it.

1329
01:53:50,858 --> 01:53:52,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Who provides it, the nature of it.

1330
01:53:52,999 --> 01:53:54,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Does it meet our standards?

1331
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:55,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Does it fit with certain things?

1332
01:53:56,301 --> 01:53:58,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Is the pace differently different?

1333
01:53:58,402 --> 01:54:00,403
[SPEAKER_14]: We've had several people try different things.

1334
01:54:00,883 --> 01:54:01,043
[SPEAKER_14]: So,

1335
01:54:02,735 --> 01:54:03,776
[SPEAKER_14]: I hear what you're saying.

1336
01:54:03,796 --> 01:54:05,056
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not telling you no.

1337
01:54:05,156 --> 01:54:10,919
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just telling you that it's got to be part of a more comprehensive approach to the use of technology.

1338
01:54:10,939 --> 01:54:20,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to say we're going to do more online learning or pilot a few more programs really avoids the bigger issue of providing a more comprehensive approach to this.

1339
01:54:20,644 --> 01:54:21,365
[SPEAKER_14]: But you're not wrong.

1340
01:54:21,445 --> 01:54:22,025
[SPEAKER_14]: We will do it.

1341
01:54:22,645 --> 01:54:31,110
[SPEAKER_14]: We just simply need to put it into a package that's going to be robust, dependable, reliable, and allow us not to have to shut down other activities

1342
01:54:31,517 --> 01:54:32,958
[SPEAKER_14]: to allow certain other things to happen.

1343
01:54:33,398 --> 01:54:33,458
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1344
01:54:33,558 --> 01:54:33,658
[SPEAKER_05]: OK?

1345
01:54:33,938 --> 01:54:34,058
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1346
01:54:34,078 --> 01:54:34,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Cunio.

1347
01:54:35,699 --> 01:54:35,999
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1348
01:54:37,059 --> 01:54:43,702
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to, I mean, the online learning is wonderful, but I think we really do have to look at who we are targeting.

1349
01:54:44,263 --> 01:54:58,469
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe this particular program is targeting students that are not doing well in school, that maybe are lower income students, that maybe are students that, you know, English is their secondary language, students that are on IEPs.

1350
01:54:59,029 --> 01:55:00,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of these parents don't have

1351
01:55:01,330 --> 01:55:03,772
[SPEAKER_05]: laptops to have their students take anything online.

1352
01:55:03,792 --> 01:55:06,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really have to be very conscious of that, which I know you all are.

1353
01:55:07,356 --> 01:55:13,221
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing I want to say is that these have been very successful grant programs year after year.

1354
01:55:13,622 --> 01:55:15,964
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that the money is diminishing unfortunately.

1355
01:55:16,704 --> 01:55:24,392
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's something that I know that I've spoken about in the past and that is, this is to get students that are on the curve of

1356
01:55:25,678 --> 01:55:27,579
[SPEAKER_05]: not making it through and failing.

1357
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:42,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, truly believe that we need certain programs like this for students that are not failing, that students are looking for that extra help, for parents that are looking for tutors and that they're paying for them on their own after school.

1358
01:55:42,747 --> 01:55:54,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we somehow maybe, you know, small baby steps could take a couple of the things that you're doing here and maybe offer them as a community schools type of program where parents can pay,

1359
01:55:55,260 --> 01:56:07,583
[SPEAKER_05]: but I guarantee you it'll probably be a lot less than what they're paying for private tutors, would take the opportunity to come back to our school at night or on a Saturday morning, because one, it's convenient for the parents.

1360
01:56:08,063 --> 01:56:09,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Two, it's just easier.

1361
01:56:09,363 --> 01:56:12,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Three, it's an environment where the students are used to.

1362
01:56:12,584 --> 01:56:16,465
[SPEAKER_05]: And C, even if we pilot that type of program to see where

1363
01:56:17,485 --> 01:56:27,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I always have parents out there saying that they're looking for tutors, they're going out, they're paying on their own, why can't we do anything?

1364
01:56:28,188 --> 01:56:32,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to explain that, you know, the grants are the grants and we have to abide by certain criteria.

1365
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:43,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking at it, okay, if we do a couple of these types of programs, and we do charge, and we bring in money, then maybe we are able to put it towards something else.

1366
01:56:43,917 --> 01:56:51,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if we start at a very bare minimum, just to make sure that we cover the salary of the teacher teaching this course.

1367
01:56:51,462 --> 01:56:54,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't have to put a lot of students in there, just a few, just to see how it goes.

1368
01:56:55,444 --> 01:56:58,767
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's where I would like to see these particular types of programs.

1369
01:56:59,427 --> 01:57:03,570
[SPEAKER_15]: One additional thing about this grant, one of the requirements is that we serve

1370
01:57:04,202 --> 01:57:13,405
[SPEAKER_15]: the postgraduate students, actually the ones who've left the high school, haven't received the diploma, but they're technically out of high school, and we actually send letters.

1371
01:57:13,425 --> 01:57:15,465
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had some wonderful success stories.

1372
01:57:15,885 --> 01:57:22,867
[SPEAKER_15]: We had one, I think it was a young man a while back, he left the high school and he did not have his diploma.

1373
01:57:23,227 --> 01:57:32,970
[SPEAKER_15]: He kept coming back to the tutorial, and I think it was maybe, it's Bernadette here, I'm not sure, I think it was maybe four years after he left the high school, he finally passed the test.

1374
01:57:33,517 --> 01:57:34,358
[SPEAKER_15]: God is diploma.

1375
01:57:34,778 --> 01:57:41,484
[SPEAKER_15]: So I mean, we've had some really, you know, really success stories with the post high school students as well.

1376
01:57:41,564 --> 01:57:45,408
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a, it's a, you know, again, it serves a lot of different purposes.

1377
01:57:45,488 --> 01:57:48,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly everyone could benefit by the extra help.

1378
01:57:49,011 --> 01:57:50,513
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's a great success.

1379
01:57:51,193 --> 01:57:52,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I get great succession.

1380
01:57:52,635 --> 01:57:58,120
[SPEAKER_15]: I also, we want to be careful about the equity issue with the online too, because that is a caution too.

1381
01:57:59,164 --> 01:58:05,207
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I suggested using the Chromebooks that we've already purchased, so that it's not a hardship to anyone.

1382
01:58:05,648 --> 01:58:14,813
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have some technology in place that we could provide for this smaller group of people taking this class.

1383
01:58:15,973 --> 01:58:16,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1384
01:58:16,994 --> 01:58:17,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Great program.

1385
01:58:17,714 --> 01:58:19,535
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to accept the report and place it on file.

1386
01:58:19,555 --> 01:58:21,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to accept the report and place it on file.

1387
01:58:21,576 --> 01:58:22,337
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

1388
01:58:22,357 --> 01:58:22,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1389
01:58:22,977 --> 01:58:23,897
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

1390
01:58:24,418 --> 01:58:25,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

1391
01:58:25,778 --> 01:58:27,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Report on secondary school class size.

1392
01:58:30,059 --> 01:58:33,781
[SPEAKER_14]: I've given you a quick snapshot of four major subjects.

1393
01:58:33,821 --> 01:58:40,644
[SPEAKER_14]: There are other subjects, and we'll give you more information going forward, but I want to verify the numbers a little more closely before I provide them to you.

1394
01:58:40,684 --> 01:58:44,786
[SPEAKER_14]: But these numbers were something I could verify, and I wanted to give you at least something this week.

1395
01:58:45,406 --> 01:58:47,487
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll keep feeding you more information on it.

1396
01:58:47,507 --> 01:58:51,728
[SPEAKER_14]: But as you can see, that the class sizes are generally very, very good.

1397
01:58:51,748 --> 01:58:55,370
[SPEAKER_14]: They're excellent, in fact, by secondary school standards across the Commonwealth.

1398
01:58:55,992 --> 01:58:58,332
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're doing well with that.

1399
01:58:58,392 --> 01:58:59,913
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some classes that are a little larger.

1400
01:58:59,933 --> 01:59:03,814
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some classes that are a little smaller, depending on those enrollments.

1401
01:59:03,874 --> 01:59:07,414
[SPEAKER_14]: But those are the average class sizes that people are there.

1402
01:59:08,034 --> 01:59:12,315
[SPEAKER_14]: And it looks pretty good to me as far as where we're going.

1403
01:59:12,335 --> 01:59:21,117
[SPEAKER_14]: We have good faculty, and I think we're handling a lot of subjects with a pretty good teacher-staff ratio.

1404
01:59:26,872 --> 01:59:36,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I have the graph that you gave us last week of how many students are at each.

1405
01:59:36,819 --> 01:59:43,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, so sixth grade at the end was on this graph says we have 177 students.

1406
01:59:44,725 --> 01:59:45,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

1407
01:59:45,725 --> 01:59:53,030
[SPEAKER_07]: And on this graph for ELA, there's 20 in each grouping, so that would be 84,

1408
01:59:56,021 --> 01:59:57,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Six students.

1409
01:59:57,682 --> 01:59:58,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Times two.

1410
01:59:58,522 --> 01:59:58,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Two teams.

1411
01:59:58,762 --> 01:59:59,082
[SPEAKER_07]: A side.

1412
01:59:59,402 --> 01:59:59,923
[SPEAKER_07]: A side.

1413
02:00:00,023 --> 02:00:00,163
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1414
02:00:00,783 --> 02:00:01,143
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's.

1415
02:00:01,163 --> 02:00:08,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Plus you have specialized classes that are there and you can get done part of the general class size but a part of an ELL or a special ed class.

1416
02:00:08,846 --> 02:00:09,106
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1417
02:00:09,866 --> 02:00:10,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

1418
02:00:10,306 --> 02:00:10,927
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty close.

1419
02:00:11,047 --> 02:00:14,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just wanted to double check with the numbers because they just look differently.

1420
02:00:15,448 --> 02:00:16,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1421
02:00:16,449 --> 02:00:17,569

1471
02:03:51,999 --> 02:03:58,143

1484
02:05:16,826 --> 02:05:26,989
[SPEAKER_04]: In a good economy, substitute teachers are difficult to find as many individuals who would appear on a substitute teacher list are able to find employment within their field.

1485
02:05:27,849 --> 02:05:32,810
[SPEAKER_04]: FY16 substitute teacher day rates were increased from $60 a day to $70 a day, a 16.7% increase over last year.

1486
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:39,812

1487
02:05:40,552 --> 02:05:49,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year, in an effort to assist in building stability, one instructional support staff was provided to each of the elementary and middle school vocational buildings.

1488
02:05:50,378 --> 02:05:54,500
[SPEAKER_04]: MHS has, for the past few years, used this method to provide building stability.

1489
02:05:55,241 --> 02:06:00,604
[SPEAKER_04]: MHS has 7.5 ISS positions and does not use the daily fill method.

1490
02:06:01,401 --> 02:06:07,086
[SPEAKER_04]: With the exception of the high school vocational, the instructional support staff is the first line of teacher replacement.

1491
02:06:07,707 --> 02:06:13,472
[SPEAKER_04]: But in the event more are needed, the substitute attendance secretary uses the daily fill list to cover needs.

1492
02:06:14,232 --> 02:06:16,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Expenditures for pay period of September 1, 2015 to December 23, 2015 were $197,469.65.

1493
02:06:16,674 --> 02:06:17,875
[SPEAKER_04]: The same time period for FY 15,

1494
02:06:27,159 --> 02:06:32,424
[SPEAKER_04]: $160,080.96 for an increase of 23% over last year.

1495
02:06:32,764 --> 02:06:45,436
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we factor in the 16.67% wage increase for the pay group for an effective increase of 6.7% increase in cost to substitute teachers for the September through December pay periods.

1496
02:06:47,117 --> 02:06:47,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Telephones.

1498
02:06:52,330 --> 02:06:56,333
[SPEAKER_04]: The list of telephone needs has been forwarded to DSCI and Comtel.

1499
02:06:57,073 --> 02:07:04,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Due to the size of the high school vocational building, the phone system will be rolled out by department, beginning with the library media space.

1500
02:07:04,619 --> 02:07:07,981
[SPEAKER_04]: The project will progress through the building, ending with the business wing.

1501
02:07:08,642 --> 02:07:15,847
[SPEAKER_04]: The project should be completed in February, with the beginning of the install in the high school library media space, which is complete.

1502
02:07:17,718 --> 02:07:28,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And a dedicated phone number has been established for the public information officer, 781-393-0599, and that is taking messages now, as with the new phones.

1503
02:07:29,711 --> 02:07:33,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Utilities, electricity costs for the period July through December 2015, $567,136.

1504
02:07:39,347 --> 02:07:46,012
[SPEAKER_04]: kilowatts, 3,785,581 versus 519,55,28 or 3,535,416 kilowatts for the same period in 2014, indicating a 9.3% cost increase, reflecting a slowdown in the sizable increase, 22% in the usage for July through October 2015.

1505
02:08:02,563 --> 02:08:12,987
[SPEAKER_04]: The principals were provided the kilowatt use for their buildings, and much of the early increase is attributed to summer programming, using more air conditioning during particularly warm summer, followed by a warm fall.

1506
02:08:13,687 --> 02:08:15,808
[SPEAKER_04]: The principals will continue monitoring usage.

1507
02:08:16,568 --> 02:08:22,891
[SPEAKER_04]: The FY16 budget is $1.18 million, and the current fiscal year electricity projection is $1,176,408.

1508
02:08:23,031 --> 02:08:26,252
[SPEAKER_04]: The city is under contract for electricity through National Grid until November 2016.

1509
02:08:33,218 --> 02:08:40,185
[SPEAKER_04]: Natural gas, for heating purposes, is running 28.8% below last year's use for the same time period, July through December.

1510
02:08:40,885 --> 02:08:45,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Colder weather did not arrive until late December, accounting for the decrease in use and dollars.

1511
02:08:46,073 --> 02:08:48,534
[SPEAKER_04]: January has returned to a typical weather pattern.

1512
02:08:49,294 --> 02:08:56,577
[SPEAKER_04]: MPS has budgeted $660,000 for FY16, and current cost for usage is $83,416.

1513
02:08:57,298 --> 02:09:01,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Historically, our greatest usage cost is the second half of the school year.

1514
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:07,962
[SPEAKER_04]: We are not under contract for natural gas, but demand and price below low securing good rates.

1515
02:09:08,042 --> 02:09:10,063
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't expect any issues there.

1516
02:09:11,842 --> 02:09:20,649
[SPEAKER_04]: And the vocational audit district, five MPS students are enrolled at Essex North Shore Agricultural and Technical School District with an annual cost of $94,759.

1518
02:09:27,975 --> 02:09:31,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Minute Man has 34 Medford students enrolled for an annual cost of $668,232.

1519
02:09:37,048 --> 02:09:42,433
[SPEAKER_04]: FY 16 budget for vocational out of district is $800,000, providing $20,621 for any changes that might occur in the second half of the year.

1520
02:09:47,658 --> 02:09:48,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1521
02:09:48,999 --> 02:09:50,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any questions?

1522
02:09:50,679 --> 02:09:50,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1523
02:09:50,859 --> 02:09:51,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Benedetto.

1524
02:09:51,540 --> 02:09:51,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1525
02:09:53,340 --> 02:10:08,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Through you to the superintendent, when we were listing the building and ground improvements, I know that we had talked about changing the lighting at the Curtis Tufts School, and Alicia Hunt sent us an email with

1526
02:10:09,530 --> 02:10:15,915
[SPEAKER_07]: some figures and figuring out how we could budget that throughout the next three years.

1527
02:10:16,035 --> 02:10:17,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you had a chance to look at that?

1528
02:10:18,857 --> 02:10:19,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Not in detail.

1529
02:10:19,777 --> 02:10:35,769
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, again, what Pat really has listed for you, the things we've done, we've got to look at, as you can see, our actual maintenance budget itself is over the top and we're going to make it up with heating and other things, but

1530
02:10:37,186 --> 02:10:42,129
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got to be careful as we select priorities and as we go into the discussion of capital improvements.

1531
02:10:43,105 --> 02:10:50,967
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's probably the best place to look at those things and not try to squeeze it into a budget that obviously we have to operate with for the rest of the school year.

1532
02:10:51,407 --> 02:10:56,948
[SPEAKER_14]: So as we get a better handle, as we move further down the year, we see that there's room we can probably tackle some things.

1533
02:10:57,648 --> 02:11:05,049
[SPEAKER_14]: But I want to be very careful coming out of January that we don't start spending money on projects that are somewhat discretionary.

1534
02:11:05,229 --> 02:11:12,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that they're things that you'd like to see, but they're somewhat discretionary against the whole issue of funding the entire district.

1535
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:23,964
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that when you see us propose to the mayor and others capital improvement plans, I think you'll start to see things like that become more dominant.

1536
02:11:24,364 --> 02:11:31,526
[SPEAKER_14]: But I also want to get more information from Alicia as to what is really available to us as opposed to what people are talking about but hasn't been firmed up.

1537
02:11:32,006 --> 02:11:39,669
[SPEAKER_07]: So my understanding through that email and through the research that she has done is that we could take

1538
02:11:40,563 --> 02:11:49,466
[SPEAKER_07]: alone on the decrease in the amount it would cost us in electricity, and the decreased amount would pay the amount of the loan to replace the lighting.

1539
02:11:49,886 --> 02:11:54,928
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that we were talking about just the Curtis, but she was also mentioning the vocational school.

1540
02:11:55,308 --> 02:12:03,551
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just wondering, it might not actually cost us any dollars out of pocket, and that's why I'm bringing it up rather than waiting for a capital improvement plan.

1541
02:12:04,217 --> 02:12:05,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we can talk about it.

1542
02:12:05,698 --> 02:12:06,719
[SPEAKER_07]: It's much more comfortable for you.

1543
02:12:06,759 --> 02:12:07,560
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be great.

1544
02:12:07,620 --> 02:12:13,544
[SPEAKER_07]: She sent us an email over the holidays, so that's why I just wanted to follow up and make sure that we're looking at that.

1545
02:12:13,785 --> 02:12:15,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1546
02:12:15,146 --> 02:12:15,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor Burke.

1547
02:12:15,426 --> 02:12:15,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Mayor Burke.

1548
02:12:16,547 --> 02:12:17,207
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of information.

1549
02:12:17,227 --> 02:12:18,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Sperry, point of information.

1550
02:12:18,488 --> 02:12:19,009
[SPEAKER_18]: Through you, Mr. Lieutenant.

1551
02:12:19,349 --> 02:12:24,133
[SPEAKER_18]: Would it be possible to ask the Senate if we could get an energy audit for the

1552
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:31,405
[SPEAKER_18]: three cafeterias and see if we could somehow change the lighting system to help cut down especially weather and use most of the summer.

1553
02:12:32,045 --> 02:12:37,429
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we can again look to all of those kinds of things but I think it should be something we put in the conversation.

1554
02:12:42,111 --> 02:12:45,272
[SPEAKER_20]: Pat, I just had a question about the school breakfast expansion grants.

1555
02:12:46,173 --> 02:12:48,934
[SPEAKER_20]: So I see a decrease for fiscal year 16.

1556
02:12:50,275 --> 02:12:55,538
[SPEAKER_20]: How is that going to impact our school breakfast programs?

1557
02:12:57,292 --> 02:13:07,318
[SPEAKER_04]: The breakfast programs are driven by percentage, and for the two schools that are already getting breakfast, they're already covered by the federal grant process, so that won't affect them at all.

1558
02:13:07,838 --> 02:13:11,100
[SPEAKER_04]: This program that you see here was part of the summer program.

1559
02:13:11,641 --> 02:13:12,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

1560
02:13:13,782 --> 02:13:20,286
[SPEAKER_07]: So, excuse me, Mayor Burke, I had another question regarding our homeless students.

1561
02:13:21,133 --> 02:13:24,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Do all of our homeless students currently have transportation?

1562
02:13:24,674 --> 02:13:25,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, they do.

1563
02:13:25,614 --> 02:13:30,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so happy to hear that because throughout the Commonwealth, there's a shortage in drivers for homeless students.

1564
02:13:31,656 --> 02:13:44,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you call a lot of the companies that they just don't have enough drivers because I personally just was trying to get a driver for a student at my school and it took a lot of time, over a month.

1565
02:13:44,851 --> 02:13:48,854
[SPEAKER_07]: to find a company that had availability to go to the town I needed to transport her.

1566
02:13:49,455 --> 02:13:58,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's an extreme cost, and this increase of 23.7% is telling of the times.

1567
02:13:58,322 --> 02:14:04,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody thinks that we're in really great shape economically throughout the Commonwealth.

1568
02:14:04,206 --> 02:14:07,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there are a lot of families that aren't in such great state.

1569
02:14:07,429 --> 02:14:08,530
[SPEAKER_07]: 23.7% increase in our cost,

1570
02:14:11,990 --> 02:14:14,091
[SPEAKER_07]: of transporting homeless students.

1571
02:14:14,131 --> 02:14:16,953
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not housing them, that's not feeding them.

1572
02:14:17,273 --> 02:14:23,117
[SPEAKER_07]: We're paying $70,000 so far this year just to get them to school every day.

1573
02:14:24,437 --> 02:14:26,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, not feeding them, not housing them.

1574
02:14:26,679 --> 02:14:31,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's a bigger problem that our commonwealth needs to look at because

1575
02:14:32,562 --> 02:14:39,667
[SPEAKER_07]: If we weren't traveling them so far, we could even pay rent for them to live in that community, and it would save the Commonwealth money.

1576
02:14:40,007 --> 02:14:46,672
[SPEAKER_07]: So I actually had called some legislators about this months ago, and this just reconfirmed.

1577
02:14:46,832 --> 02:14:53,176
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm pushing that forward, and I'm meeting with people this week to just talk about what we can do as a Commonwealth.

1578
02:14:55,277 --> 02:14:58,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe after I meet with them, I'll be happy to speak with you about it.

1579
02:14:58,639 --> 02:15:00,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Because- Happy to talk about it.

1580
02:15:00,780 --> 02:15:02,760
[SPEAKER_14]: As you know, we've talked about this before.

1581
02:15:02,801 --> 02:15:04,101
[SPEAKER_14]: McKinney-Vento was not new.

1582
02:15:04,941 --> 02:15:08,483
[SPEAKER_14]: The state auditor indicated that it was an unfunded mandate.

1583
02:15:09,509 --> 02:15:21,554
[SPEAKER_14]: And the state initially funded it, then went through nine seat cuts from Governor Patrick, and then has been funded at maybe 50%, 60% of actual cost for the last couple of years.

1584
02:15:21,614 --> 02:15:31,638
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, as I go back and we talk about the state budget, you talk about what you'd like to do, let's get a handle on what's coming to us before we start saying we're going to do this, we're going to do that.

1585
02:15:32,319 --> 02:15:37,921
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a lot of very worthy goals, but we have to make sure we've got the resources to do those worthy goals.

1586
02:15:38,337 --> 02:15:41,798
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you have to prioritize which ones you're going to spend the money on.

1587
02:15:42,738 --> 02:15:51,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I just want to thank your administration that provides and does this work to make sure that our homeless students have rights to school.

1588
02:15:52,321 --> 02:15:53,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Abraham.

1589
02:15:53,661 --> 02:15:54,001
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1590
02:15:54,281 --> 02:15:59,503
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such an important role, and it takes a lot of time and effort, because it has to go to be bidded.

1591
02:16:00,163 --> 02:16:03,124
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really, it's very involved.

1592
02:16:03,244 --> 02:16:07,805
[SPEAKER_07]: And parents call every day, because they really need those rights.

1593
02:16:08,450 --> 02:16:10,793
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not always easy.

1594
02:16:11,374 --> 02:16:17,582
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really appreciate all the work done to make sure that all of our students in Method have a way to get to school.

1595
02:16:18,083 --> 02:16:19,785
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really appreciate that time and effort.

1596
02:16:19,825 --> 02:16:21,187
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you for this report, Pat.

1597
02:16:21,567 --> 02:16:22,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the report.

1598
02:16:22,489 --> 02:16:24,952
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for the comprehensive report.

1599
02:16:34,827 --> 02:16:36,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, we have an addendum to the schedule.

1600
02:16:37,309 --> 02:16:43,454
[SPEAKER_09]: School committee resolutions be it resolved that the Metric School Committee expresses sincere condolences to the family of Joseph Laporta.

1601
02:16:43,955 --> 02:16:51,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Laporta was a prominent member of the school administrative staff for many years, serving as the head of the driver's education program and school security.

1602
02:16:51,982 --> 02:16:56,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Laporta was active in local Kiwanis and many other local community service organizations.

1603
02:16:56,546 --> 02:16:58,748
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could all please rise for a moment of silence.

1604
02:17:08,956 --> 02:17:11,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Negotiation of legal matters, there are none.

1605
02:17:11,138 --> 02:17:14,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Hearing and seeing that, I'll take a motion to adjourn this meeting.

1606
02:17:14,581 --> 02:17:15,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn.

1607
02:17:15,642 --> 02:17:16,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn by Ms.

1608
02:17:16,643 --> 02:17:16,983
[SPEAKER_09]: Cunha.

1609
02:17:17,023 --> 02:17:17,904
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor?

1610
02:17:18,144 --> 02:17:18,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1611
02:17:18,345 --> 02:17:18,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

1612
02:17:18,965 --> 02:17:19,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Meeting is adjourned.
