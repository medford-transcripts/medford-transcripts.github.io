52
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:41,512
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't necessarily think we'll go the entire meeting tonight, but I could be wrong.

53
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:49,476
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to start, I guess, with special education, because we started with behavioral health last time.

54
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:56,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Special education, we are working on friendships and community in school.

55
00:04:57,475 --> 00:05:03,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were able, I apologize for getting the last month's minutes out to you all so late today.

56
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:11,166
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was saying, for those who just joined, I just got a new baby puppy who's like three pounds and eight weeks old.

57
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:15,870
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's literally like a baby mommy day thing going on.

58
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,811
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize.

59
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:17,852
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been preparing for that.

60
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:18,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So my apologies.

61
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:20,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time I will get them out to you sooner.

62
00:05:23,553 --> 00:05:28,354
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a couple of things that happened in the last, between our last meeting and now.

63
00:05:29,695 --> 00:05:33,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We had Charlotte Heim, who's here.

64
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:37,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, since we have a minute or two, maybe folks wouldn't mind introducing themselves.

65
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:45,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of you know each other, but I'll just call on you to introduce yourself so that people don't have to guess who's first.

66
00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:49,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte, if you wouldn't mind just introducing yourself and letting folks know what your role is.

67
00:05:56,201 --> 00:05:57,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you able to unmute?

68
00:05:58,842 --> 00:05:59,542
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let me see.

69
00:06:00,603 --> 00:06:01,383
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I unmute?

70
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:02,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, ask to unmute.

71
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:08,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin, I actually just created it so that anyone can unmute themselves for the time being for this purpose.

72
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:09,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

73
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:10,746

80
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:48,784
[SPEAKER_17]: And in conjunction with some of the elementary and middle school staff, we've sort of laid some of the seed work for what Melanie has been talking about.

81
00:06:49,764 --> 00:06:51,445
[SPEAKER_02]: What our subcommittee has been talking about.

151
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,380
[SPEAKER_10]: And he spoke about his program.

152
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,624
[SPEAKER_10]: He spoke about civil rights for disability civil rights.

153
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:02,547
[SPEAKER_10]: And he also spoke about

154
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:11,651
[SPEAKER_10]: person first language and choosing language, which was really interesting and informative because that's always evolving too.

155
00:11:12,711 --> 00:11:14,772
[SPEAKER_10]: And also about ableism.

156
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:16,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

157
00:11:16,832 --> 00:11:23,594
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe, do you want to share what ableism and person first language is just for folks who may not know?

158
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:24,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlotte, would you mind?

159
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:26,375
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to, I can.

160
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:27,635
[SPEAKER_10]: I can.

161
00:11:28,376 --> 00:11:32,237
[SPEAKER_10]: So the person first language is starting with a person,

162
00:11:33,268 --> 00:11:36,969
[SPEAKER_10]: with a disability, you don't start with a disability first.

163
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:57,254
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it's the conversation has evolved from there too, where once that might be a safe starting place or a more inclusive starting place, but then moving along to identifying an individual as they wish to be identified.

164
00:11:57,274 --> 00:11:57,314
[SPEAKER_10]: So,

165
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:05,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of times that there was a big sort of person first movement for a while.

166
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:11,837
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a lot of the folks in the autism community definitely said, you know, they preferred autistic.

167
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:17,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always good to obviously defer to the person with the disability.

168
00:12:17,478 --> 00:12:18,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Charlotte.

169
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Melanie, you do it so well.

170
00:12:20,979 --> 00:12:22,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Just talk about the ableism.

171
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:22,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Ableism.

172
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:35,532
[SPEAKER_02]: is the, Tom Hare taught me, is the idea that it is better to see than not see, hear than not hear, walk than roll.

173
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:53,077
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not his quote, it's one of his colleagues that sort of started the idea of ableism, or founded the word, but ableism is essentially believing that it is better to live without a disability than with a disability, so inheriting discrimination against individuals with disabilities.

174
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:55,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

175
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:56,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at that presentation.

176
00:12:56,328 --> 00:12:57,529
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really nice to see.

177
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:03,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And what a great class Carla and Mr. Skorka have with the common ground.

178
00:13:03,814 --> 00:13:09,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And Epic was a really great organization for them to be part of and listen to.

179
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:11,860
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just nice to be able to see that.

180
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:22,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I really liked about my observation anyway, and I'm sure that Mr. Skorka and Carla have extended the invitation to folks here to observe the common ground.

181
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:35,057
[SPEAKER_02]: was just the natural friendships that exist without having to really be facilitated so much by the adults.

182
00:13:35,377 --> 00:13:38,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the goal in all of our schools.

183
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:42,240
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a good model for being able to start.

184
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:52,385
[SPEAKER_10]: And just to follow up, I received an email from a student today from Mr. Skorka's class that wants to do a project on ableism.

185
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:53,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

186
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:55,758
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

187
00:13:56,318 --> 00:14:07,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd love to put them in touch if they want with Dr. Tom Hare, who, you know, he's retired from Harvard now, but he always also taught us disability is natural, that we are all disabled at some point.

188
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:17,622
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, whether it's by COVID, you know, pregnancy, Alzheimer's, anything, ultimately old age, whatever, we're all disabled at some point.

189
00:14:17,642 --> 00:14:19,043
[SPEAKER_02]: So disability is really natural.

190
00:14:19,163 --> 00:14:19,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tom,

191
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:24,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he wouldn't mind me sharing because he's been sharing himself publicly.

192
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:32,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom was actually just diagnosed, he retired last January and he was just diagnosed last month with ALS.

193
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:44,390
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, disability is natural and Tom, if anybody is, you know, is prepared for a life with disability for the remainder of his life.

194
00:14:45,245 --> 00:14:50,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, hard diagnosis for sure, but I'm so glad he's, um, he has a great community surrounding him.

195
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:54,347
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but I'm sure he would love to talk to your student about ableism.

196
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:57,807
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they're interested, um, Tom's Tom's their guy.

197
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:59,408
[SPEAKER_02]: So great.

198
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:00,128
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in touch.

199
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:00,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

200
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:01,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

201
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:12,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then, um, I was thinking maybe, uh, Uh, Denise, we could talk a little bit if you wouldn't mind, uh, or maybe Carla.

202
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:19,676
[SPEAKER_02]: You might talk first a little bit about some of the discussion we've been having around the common ground program.

203
00:15:20,276 --> 00:15:23,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we have some folks that are new to this meeting tonight.

204
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:24,360
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you could just

205
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:29,485
[SPEAKER_02]: orient them to the Common Ground, if you would, and what's been happening at the high school, please.

206
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:30,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

207
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:34,747
[SPEAKER_15]: For anyone who doesn't know, Common Ground is a reversed inclusion class.

208
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:40,888
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have students come into my classroom, and it's pretty split right now, about five and five.

209
00:15:40,928 --> 00:15:44,389
[SPEAKER_15]: So five students from general ed, five students with a disability.

210
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead of kind of trying to fit students into

211
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:59,115
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, maybe an elective for meaningful inclusion, why not just invite them into our world in our classroom and and kind of make it work for us so it's been really successful.

212
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:09,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now we're doing kind of like team building activities, things like that they know each other pretty well because it's been about two years now and Melanie recently we talked about.

213
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:22,789
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of playing with the idea of getting it to be an actual elective, you know, on a course sheet and opening it up to students who are not just in the CCSR, but really any students.

214
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:32,416
[SPEAKER_15]: The kids in the CCSR are absolutely amazing, but if we really want to get deep into disability awareness, I think we need to go beyond that, because the students who

215
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:38,400
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of are aware already and are informed, are the kids that are signing up for it.

216
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,344
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's the students who are not signing up for it that we really want to reach.

217
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:44,245
[SPEAKER_15]: And that goes for students and staff as well.

218
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Carla, for sharing that.

219
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:57,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe, Susanna, if you wouldn't mind just telling us a little bit where you are in your disability awareness course as well.

220
00:16:58,997 --> 00:16:59,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

221
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:02,500
[SPEAKER_08]: So actually, Charlotte and Carla

222
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:10,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Followed me right over here tonight so we had our fifth of five sessions that wrapped up this evening.

223
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:13,710
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this evening.

224
00:17:15,085 --> 00:17:25,091
[SPEAKER_08]: Individuals worked in breakout rooms to discuss different lesson plans that they have developed around disability awareness at the grade levels that they work with and their roles in the schools.

225
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:34,116
[SPEAKER_08]: So all the participants, including Charlotte and Carla, came up with the different ways that they would be addressing this within their coursework.

226
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:43,622
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that we're in a good place to kind of think about next steps, having just wrapped up that kind of foundational knowledge for people.

227
00:17:47,603 --> 00:17:48,123
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

228
00:17:48,263 --> 00:18:05,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And Susanna, I know that you shared your syllabus with the curriculum subcommittee, but at some point it would be great if you wouldn't mind sharing with our colleagues here, member Russo and member Mestone, just so they might have some awareness of the program that you do.

229
00:18:05,628 --> 00:18:05,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

230
00:18:05,968 --> 00:18:06,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I would appreciate that.

231
00:18:06,828 --> 00:18:09,609
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll put the link into the chat if I'm able to.

232
00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:11,189
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

233
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:11,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

234
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:12,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

235
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:22,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to let folks know if you have questions or you want to interject, please feel free to do so.

236
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So Denise, I would love it if you wouldn't mind.

237
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:34,823
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that we've done, we've had this evolution of this conversation around how to build friendships.

238
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:45,593
[SPEAKER_02]: with students with disabilities in our community and schools for all the obvious reasons, both related to equity, related to student achievement.

239
00:18:46,133 --> 00:18:54,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Both students with and without disabilities do better academically when they're integrated, as the research has shown, among other things.

240
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:56,919
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's part of the initiative.

241
00:18:56,979 --> 00:19:00,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Common Ground has been a really great model at the high school level.

242
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:06,125
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have had some parents from the autism support group and also

243
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:13,944
[SPEAKER_02]: from C pack that had been exploring best buddies and I believe that exploration kit is continuing.

244
00:19:14,464 --> 00:19:27,076
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've also looked within the district to see you know what model currently exist and how may it be expanded or improved upon and common ground is really been that model and so we've had some discussions both with Mister

245
00:19:28,278 --> 00:19:28,758
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ms.

246
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:33,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Andre, Mr. Skorka, teaches the CCSR.

247
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,481
[SPEAKER_02]: His exact title is escaping me right now.

248
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:40,802
[SPEAKER_02]: And also general education teacher at the high school.

249
00:19:41,523 --> 00:19:43,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Ms.

250
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:46,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Andre is a teacher, special education teacher at the high school.

251
00:19:49,377 --> 00:19:54,140
[SPEAKER_02]: We have reached out to we were thinking about a pilot model at the elementary school.

252
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the middle school as sort of a next natural step and what you know what that might look like.

253
00:19:59,723 --> 00:20:10,049
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did some initial reaching out to some folks at the middle school that at least the McGlynn that I know I still I have a preliminary email out to both of the principals.

254
00:20:11,449 --> 00:20:14,632
[SPEAKER_02]: at the middle schools to discuss with them a little bit more as well.

255
00:20:16,354 --> 00:20:20,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Staff and people who may be interested at each school, the Andrews and the McGlynn.

256
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:28,825
[SPEAKER_02]: But Denise Desjardins, who is a physical therapist who introduced herself a little while ago, has talked to some folks at the McGlynn.

257
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:30,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand, Denise, there's some interest there.

258
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:31,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?

259
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:39,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Denise.

260
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:42,694
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, Nicole Sylvester may be jumping on.

261
00:20:42,734 --> 00:20:44,155
[SPEAKER_17]: She's caught in traffic.

262
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:46,475
[SPEAKER_17]: So I mean, certainly every you can't hear me.

263
00:20:47,296 --> 00:20:47,716
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

264
00:20:48,076 --> 00:20:48,576
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me?

265
00:20:48,976 --> 00:20:49,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I can hear you now.

266
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:49,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

267
00:20:53,698 --> 00:20:53,878
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

268
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:56,579
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, sorry.

269
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:07,102
[SPEAKER_17]: So we've been doing Special Olympics now for probably the past 14 or 15 years where we've partnered with Malden High School

270
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:17,209
[SPEAKER_17]: in providing a day when students from Medford could participate with their cohorts from other cities.

271
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,430
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's become a yearly thing.

272
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:36,265
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, we were not able to do it last year, obviously because of COVID, but it has been something that in the past, Melanie and I spoke about sort of Medford becoming more involved with, because Malden was certainly happy to kind of share some of the load.

273
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:44,985
[SPEAKER_17]: because they put a lot of effort and a lot of time into it, Special Olympics.

274
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:47,506
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's kind of where we started last year.

275
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,248
[SPEAKER_17]: That's one area.

276
00:21:50,368 --> 00:22:05,439
[SPEAKER_17]: As far as the common ground thing is considered, at Melanie's request, I reached out, because I am basically in every school in the system, I reached out specifically to the person who runs the CCSR, both at the McGlynn and the Andrews, and that's Megan Olsen.

277
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:15,732
[SPEAKER_17]: And we emailed her, but as you guys can appreciate right now with two days before February vacation, it's a bit chaotic.

278
00:22:18,872 --> 00:22:30,754
[SPEAKER_17]: But Megan Olson is very interested in sort of being involved in this as is Casey Goldberg, who is the counterpart to Carla here at the McGlynn Middle School.

279
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,423
[SPEAKER_17]: And Nicole Sylvester, so again, at the McGlynn Middle School.

280
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:55,399
[SPEAKER_17]: So Megan felt that having CCSR students from both the McGlynn and the Andrews, she runs both parts of it involved with our McGlynn Middle School students would be a great way to sort of start to pilot this.

281
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,882
[SPEAKER_17]: I have observed college programs starting last year.

282
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,432
[SPEAKER_17]: and sat in on a number of the sessions with that.

283
00:23:02,552 --> 00:23:11,260
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I think one of the things we need to remember is obviously our middle school cohorts, probably don't have the level of maturity.

284
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:26,192
[SPEAKER_17]: I was amazed by the level of maturity that a lot of our high schoolers demonstrated with our students at the high school level, but I certainly think that Megan has

285
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:35,014
[SPEAKER_17]: as very good ideas of how a program like this, it's just a matter of everybody being in the same place at the same time.

286
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

287
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:40,776
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really helpful.

288
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:47,939
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I also, again, if folks have questions or want to interrupt, please stop me and let me know.

289
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:53,402
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that was also talked about in this sort of process is if this were to happen,

290
00:23:54,055 --> 00:23:55,858
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what could next steps look like?

291
00:23:55,918 --> 00:24:03,270
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, these are, these are just sort of ideas that have not been solidified by any means, or just sort of putting things out there right now, but.

292
00:24:04,091 --> 00:24:20,016
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the suggestions was that this was actually a course, potentially not just a club or a group, but that maybe it was something that could occur, for example, in the middle school level during the wind block, for example.

293
00:24:20,056 --> 00:24:22,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I know that this is just sort of putting it out there.

294
00:24:23,017 --> 00:24:30,319
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily anything that's solidified, but it's just sort of what the buy-in looks like for that and how it's actually,

295
00:24:32,148 --> 00:24:50,271
[SPEAKER_02]: implemented and that there's a curriculum that exists and that there's some relationship to the disability awareness program that Susanna is implementing, but also the infusion of disability awareness into materials.

296
00:24:50,351 --> 00:24:59,453
[SPEAKER_02]: As I know, Alex Lorick and Tonya Sullivan, co-chairs of our CPAC, have really been talking about in terms of lessons.

297
00:24:59,513 --> 00:25:01,653
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we're also talking about in other groups such as

298
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:06,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah Silver, PB): The anti racism group and how we're looking at how we're doing these things organically.

299
00:25:07,097 --> 00:25:17,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so that was also an idea with a common ground and in some next steps clearly would be, it seems to me, some professional development or

300
00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:25,203
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding of what common ground is at the middle school level and buy-in, obviously, from the principals and staff there.

301
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:28,385
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like we've got some good buy-in at the McGlynn right now.

302
00:25:28,405 --> 00:25:31,447
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be nice to cultivate that at the Andrews as well.

303
00:25:32,167 --> 00:25:44,655
[SPEAKER_02]: And then thinking about how this relates to the community, you know, once these friendships are cultivated too, as we're looking at, for example, we had Kate Quinn on from the Medford rec department last month and

304
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:58,566
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this natural friendships that exist will, I think, then facilitate people wanting to be, you know, to extend that to the community as well and be involved with students with disabilities in the community and beyond our schools.

305
00:25:58,606 --> 00:26:04,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like a natural, you know, outcrop potentially of this common ground.

306
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:06,724
[SPEAKER_02]: initiative.

307
00:26:07,284 --> 00:26:09,727
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to sort of open it up to discussion.

308
00:26:10,668 --> 00:26:19,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've got another say, 15 minutes before we switch over to behavioral health, but I'd like to have some discussion around this topic and idea.

309
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:26,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carla, maybe, you know, if you want to talk a little bit more or or not about sort of the the

310
00:26:29,132 --> 00:26:36,025
[SPEAKER_02]: syllabus idea and sort of just exactly, you know, Susanna did this syllabus with the disability awareness.

311
00:26:36,085 --> 00:26:39,411
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously when we have a roadmap, it's easier to go by.

312
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

313
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:44,145
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think what you're saying to kind of focus on one thing.

314
00:26:44,265 --> 00:26:48,288
[SPEAKER_15]: So starting it right now with inside the buildings, inside each building.

315
00:26:48,308 --> 00:26:56,793
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's what we need to focus on rather than, you know, we have these great ideas in the future of these community outreach and community hangouts and things like that.

316
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:01,556
[SPEAKER_15]: But in order to really put a lot of effort into something that's going to be successful, we need to narrow it down.

317
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:02,556
[SPEAKER_15]: So I agree.

318
00:27:03,137 --> 00:27:04,518
[SPEAKER_15]: And Denise, I know we talked about

319
00:27:05,609 --> 00:27:20,404
[SPEAKER_15]: talking with all you know the parts but like you said it's last couple days before vacation it got away from us so I think after break will be a good time for that but yeah I would love to talk to the people who are more expert in that

320
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:22,006
[SPEAKER_15]: age group.

321
00:27:22,046 --> 00:27:37,287
[SPEAKER_15]: So like you said, Megan has some great ideas about what to do on the on the middle school level, I think you said so, you know, I know how it works at the high school, but really, it's going to be the people who are inside the elementary and middle schools who are going to figure out the way that it's going to work best for those age groups.

322
00:27:40,395 --> 00:27:41,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, sorry, and one more thing.

323
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:59,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Susanna, the class that we have right now, a lot of the lesson plans that I saw today, and I'm sure they were, I mean, I was only in a small group of five and we shared lesson plans about not only disability awareness, but a lot of people shared, you know, a lot of general ed teachers shared plans about how they would accommodate or modify lessons for all.

324
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:06,101
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we're talking about a curriculum of what is this, you know, what is this common ground elective in a syllabus gonna look like?

325
00:28:06,441 --> 00:28:09,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it does involve a lot of disability awareness lessons.

326
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:16,034
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a lot that we could pull from, I think, just in the course right now that you're teaching.

327
00:28:17,271 --> 00:28:17,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Carla.

328
00:28:17,951 --> 00:28:18,852
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also think, Ms.

329
00:28:18,892 --> 00:28:22,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Andre, and I also think, like you said, it's universal design for learning, right?

330
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:36,238
[SPEAKER_02]: So like what you guys were doing, Susanna, and I love that you're utilizing the disability awareness course to then work on how to apply this to curriculum and in the classroom.

331
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's critical.

332
00:28:37,798 --> 00:28:44,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's really exciting and building this resource that we've talked about in the past of these

333
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:55,375
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces, and I know that the CPAC is next month doing, or April has a presentation on differentiated curriculum that Carla is going to be a part of.

334
00:28:55,435 --> 00:29:10,921
[SPEAKER_02]: So I encourage you guys to attend that as well, because then you can really see how it applies to all learners, you know, when you're able to use universal design for learning, every learner can benefit the, you know, the visual learner, the tactile learner, the, all of those.

335
00:29:10,961 --> 00:29:13,302
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's a great example across the board.

336
00:29:13,322 --> 00:29:14,202
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Carla.

337
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:22,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Joan.

338
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:32,037
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to piggyback on the common ground and and the possibility of it being an elective course so I know that CPAC had reached out to me.

339
00:29:32,057 --> 00:29:37,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was at the beginning of this week or last week to start conversations with.

340
00:29:39,351 --> 00:29:47,417
[SPEAKER_09]: the principal of the high school, Paul DeLeva, to see what steps we would have to take in order for this to be part of the curriculum.

341
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:52,301
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will be meeting after vacation to discuss this.

342
00:29:53,201 --> 00:30:05,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we can involve Carla and Susanna and CPAC and have conversations about what we want this elective to look like, the syllabus, that sort of thing.

343
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,633
[SPEAKER_09]: So these talks are underway and we're hoping

344
00:30:08,993 --> 00:30:13,575
[SPEAKER_09]: to have more information after the February break in what direction we're going to head with it.

345
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:14,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

346
00:30:15,016 --> 00:30:15,817
[SPEAKER_02]: That's encouraging.

347
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:29,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, as we're thinking about the middle school model as well, thinking about, you know, cost, obviously, because that's another part of the piece of the picture from a policy and school committee perspective.

348
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:35,486
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there had been some discussion about, you know, you know, CCSR offers stipends for

349
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,244
[SPEAKER_02]: for their folks that are involved.

350
00:30:38,264 --> 00:30:44,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Megan CCSR just went from, I think I was talking to her the other day, cause we're interested in having Gracie enrolled.

351
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:49,510
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think she just went from Megan Olson at the middle school, went from like 22 members of CCSR.

352
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,951
[SPEAKER_02]: She just got an additional 40.

353
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:54,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So she just, you know, expanded really quickly.

354
00:30:54,393 --> 00:30:59,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're looking at a second person on a stipend position to support her and CCSR.

355
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:01,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So thinking about what this actually breaks down

356
00:31:02,483 --> 00:31:09,531
[SPEAKER_02]: to at a cost level for the element, I mean, for the middle school pilot as we're thinking about that as well.

357
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:22,544
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it sounds to me that we, I know that Susanna and CPAC did a really great presentation with the curriculum subcommittee, I think two months ago, if that's right.

358
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:37,566
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also just encourage and I would ask my colleagues their opinion in encouraging, you know, the curriculum subcommittee to, you know, be aware and or, you know, involved in some aspects just so that they also know.

359
00:31:37,746 --> 00:31:40,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like seeing the crossover between the committees.

360
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:45,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really great for us to work together and communicate with each other across things.

361
00:31:45,189 --> 00:31:52,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this would be a great opportunity, but I would also defer to member Russo and member Mistone to get their opinion on that.

362
00:31:57,774 --> 00:32:00,136
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just say that I'm not on the curriculum subcommittee.

363
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:19,111
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have popped on a couple of times and to fill in for other members that weren't able to make it, but I certainly agree the cross pollinization or whatever the right words are is definitely the way to go.

364
00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:26,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think about process wise, you know, do we sort of package things up and send things between subcommittees

365
00:32:27,085 --> 00:32:29,686
[SPEAKER_03]: for their particular take on issues.

366
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:38,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I think our subcommittee structure this year is dramatically improved, but I don't for a second think it can actually get better.

367
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:53,397
[SPEAKER_03]: So certainly that's something to think about when I know when we have a motion, it often feels like we just send everything to the rules and policies subcommittee, because the word policy is in there and not everything probably should start there.

368
00:32:55,898 --> 00:32:56,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

369
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:03,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else want to comment or ask questions?

370
00:33:04,463 --> 00:33:06,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to make one comment.

371
00:33:06,544 --> 00:33:12,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that Carla's idea of taking many of the lesson plans that were already created by educators and district.

372
00:33:12,966 --> 00:33:20,129
[SPEAKER_08]: And trying to, you know, work with those teachers who came up with those ideas is a good place for us to start.

373
00:33:20,429 --> 00:33:29,933
[SPEAKER_08]: And as part of the course, I created a website and the website has a lot of resources around

374
00:33:31,631 --> 00:33:44,777
[SPEAKER_08]: all different aspects of disability awareness, including one page that's just dedicated to lesson plans that were made by Medford teachers during the last round of the course and this round of the course.

375
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:57,944
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's also many other resources that are available, links to websites that delve into specific disabilities and teachers can really gain a lot of information or parents or whoever the stakeholders are.

376
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:00,025
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to bring that up

377
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:06,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing that we already have created that we can probably pull from as we move forward with next steps.

378
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:16,870
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that all of the groundwork that's been laid by Carla and Charlotte and Michael at the high school level and everything that Denise has done district wide, we can really build upon that.

379
00:34:17,191 --> 00:34:19,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we already have some good groundwork laid.

380
00:34:20,452 --> 00:34:21,372
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so exciting.

381
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:25,834
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you send us the website in the chat as well?

382
00:34:26,834 --> 00:34:30,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to push that out on social media and perhaps see Pat

383
00:34:30,617 --> 00:34:31,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Ken as well.

384
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:40,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also just want to really thank Alex and Tanya, our CPAC co-chairs for moving all of this forward in the past couple of years.

385
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:48,641
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been really great to see the collaboration with the district and moving forward on a number of these issues.

386
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:51,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm excited about that.

387
00:34:51,481 --> 00:34:55,002
[SPEAKER_17]: I can just add something regarding Susanna's course.

388
00:34:55,202 --> 00:34:59,923
[SPEAKER_17]: So both times that Susanna's offered her disability awareness course, I've been a presenter.

389
00:35:00,522 --> 00:35:03,264
[SPEAKER_17]: At the course, the first time the course was offered, I took it.

390
00:35:04,044 --> 00:35:09,948
[SPEAKER_17]: And I strongly believe that it should be offered to the whole district.

391
00:35:09,988 --> 00:35:11,289
[SPEAKER_17]: I know it is offered to the whole district.

392
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:13,611
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize, it's professional development.

393
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:17,053
[SPEAKER_17]: But the insights, I've been doing this for a very long time.

394
00:35:18,214 --> 00:35:23,117
[SPEAKER_17]: And I learned new things when I took the course a year ago.

395
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,882
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that the way that she's able to get the information and compile the information.

396
00:35:30,062 --> 00:35:35,225
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't tell you how much I heard from people who attended the course last year, Gen Ed teachers.

397
00:35:35,905 --> 00:35:42,388
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I cover every school except the Brooks or people who, you know, people who joined it last year and people who did this year.

398
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:47,491
[SPEAKER_17]: The comments, and I think Katie Fantino is on here.

399
00:35:48,245 --> 00:35:56,827
[SPEAKER_17]: who is an EL teacher over at the McGlynn, and she said to me after I presented at this course, something to the effect of, I never realized this.

400
00:35:57,628 --> 00:36:05,470
[SPEAKER_17]: I never realized that this, so I can't speak highly enough of how important Susanna's course is for our district.

401
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:14,272
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how, I know professionally development wise presenting it after school is challenging for a lot of people.

402
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:16,753
[SPEAKER_17]: I wish it could be part of a professional development day,

403
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:20,211
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think, I think so highly of it.

404
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:23,216
[SPEAKER_17]: And Katie, I know that you came up to me.

405
00:36:23,236 --> 00:36:28,826
[SPEAKER_17]: And after even part of it that I presented as and said, you learned so much just that day.

406
00:36:29,247 --> 00:36:29,708
[SPEAKER_17]: There was speech.

407
00:36:32,946 --> 00:36:35,089
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if I can make a comment on the course.

408
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, please.

409
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:52,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, like, especially I want to say, Melanie, you're like, you were the first presenter and I don't know hopefully I didn't have like you know some weird face expression while I was like watch watching you but it was like, I was just amazed, and it was.

410
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:57,892
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the important thing is building this background knowledge that we don't have.

411
00:36:58,612 --> 00:37:03,874
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though I mean I, I don't have a lot of experience in special ed.

412
00:37:04,935 --> 00:37:10,237
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to Denise a lot sometimes if I need something or I go to our speech pathologist if I need something.

413
00:37:10,657 --> 00:37:15,361
[SPEAKER_00]: or even our special ed teachers at the school if I want to get more information.

414
00:37:16,022 --> 00:37:20,445
[SPEAKER_00]: But this course, and I said, has opened my eyes.

415
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,747
[SPEAKER_00]: It has given me a different perspective of things.

416
00:37:24,669 --> 00:37:36,418
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important even just to know the background about disability and the stereotypes that we have that we just subconsciously do it.

417
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:50,424
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and one thing I also learned is like the language, the language that, you know, like you said, you know, people with autism want to be called autistic.

418
00:37:51,124 --> 00:37:54,846
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, now I have all these notes, I have all that.

419
00:37:54,966 --> 00:38:05,630
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that as a teacher, an educator, and as a person, I can take all this that I've learned in the course, and I will not only apply it to my teaching, but apply it in general.

420
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:18,736
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and today we had, today we finished what we, besides our presentation of our lessons, you know, Susanna had great books that I never knew about.

421
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:23,798
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are great books that, you know, if teachers are aware of,

422
00:38:24,778 --> 00:38:30,660
[SPEAKER_00]: they can, unfortunately we'll have to like maybe purchase ourselves, but it's great books to have in the classroom.

423
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:44,545
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we talk about diversity, we want to get diversity in the classroom, but I think we don't have, I don't even know how to describe it, but like maybe like we don't have disability books in the classroom.

424
00:38:45,386 --> 00:38:51,488
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a book where children are learning that just because somebody

425
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,915
[SPEAKER_00]: know, is in a wheelchair, they can still do other things.

426
00:38:56,897 --> 00:38:58,139
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

427
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:58,519
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

428
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,601
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rambling on.

429
00:38:59,621 --> 00:39:00,062
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

430
00:39:00,422 --> 00:39:01,324
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's super helpful.

431
00:39:01,344 --> 00:39:01,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

432
00:39:01,664 --> 00:39:04,108
[SPEAKER_02]: Disability is diversity is what I hear you saying.

433
00:39:04,269 --> 00:39:06,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of times, you know,

434
00:39:07,638 --> 00:39:10,719
[SPEAKER_02]: as all too often happens, it gets left off the table.

435
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:16,021
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, again, you know, being inclusive and thinking about it in that light is really, really important.

436
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:26,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those who don't know, for the first session, what Susanna does is she intros the class with Judy Heumann, who is a, you know, disability pioneer.

437
00:39:26,805 --> 00:39:31,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that her last name is Heumann because she has more humanity probably than anybody I've ever

438
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:39,094
[SPEAKER_02]: known and she, you know, you should look at her TED talk if you get the occasion, H-E-U-M-A-N-N is her last name.

439
00:39:39,134 --> 00:39:45,978
[SPEAKER_02]: And also she just was featured in Crip Camp, which is a Netflix film that I highly recommend to everyone as well.

440
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:53,221
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the first session, Susanna does talk about disability rights as human rights, as civil rights.

441
00:39:53,342 --> 00:39:58,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a very important point in grounding disability for the community.

442
00:39:58,844 --> 00:39:59,265
[SPEAKER_02]: And so,

443
00:40:00,394 --> 00:40:08,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate the opportunity, Susanna, to come and share what I know about the history of disability and the civil rights movement, and also a very personal experience.

444
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,779
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that opportunity every year.

445
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:12,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It means a lot to me.

446
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I see Alex Lorch has her hand up and Claire Flaherty.

447
00:40:16,222 --> 00:40:21,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Claire wants to also talk about art therapy, Claire, and communicating support about that.

448
00:40:21,604 --> 00:40:22,925
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love for you to do that as well.

449
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:26,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So Alex, let's start with you and then Claire, please.

450
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:26,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

451
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:33,073
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to say that this year Tonya and I were part of Susanna's training.

452
00:40:33,213 --> 00:40:38,359
[SPEAKER_18]: We were on the parents panel and I also did the same thing last year.

453
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,763
[SPEAKER_18]: It's so amazing that this was brought to Medford.

454
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,087
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to let people know, those who don't know that

455
00:40:47,226 --> 00:40:51,710
[SPEAKER_18]: CPEC is really advocating for a disability awareness curriculum that goes into the classroom.

456
00:40:52,231 --> 00:41:00,159
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is, you know, our children are exposed and learn about disability in a way that it's age appropriate and all the children in the district.

457
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:02,622
[SPEAKER_18]: But I was thinking that, you know, so we are advocating for this.

458
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:04,469
[SPEAKER_18]: to happen in elementary level.

459
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:12,377
[SPEAKER_18]: And for sure, we'll start with the lessons that Susana is doing with people who are taking the training.

460
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:21,605
[SPEAKER_18]: But I was thinking that parts of the training may be appropriate as they are for high school students, which we've been talking about the maturity.

461
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:26,210
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe we can think about that and do this from different levels.

462
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:30,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Alex and Claire.

463
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:36,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna give you an opportunity to speak now, if you would just sort of wrap up the special education section of our session.

464
00:41:36,532 --> 00:41:50,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are gonna circle back around after February vacation, Carla and Joan and CPAC, and we'll keep our subcommittee members informed of what's happening there.

465
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:53,596
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Claire, if you could share with us your perspective, please.

466
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:53,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

467
00:41:55,117 --> 00:41:56,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, good evening, everybody.

468
00:41:56,237 --> 00:42:16,623
[SPEAKER_12]: So Melanie actually invited me to come to the meeting tonight because at our last McGlynn PTO meeting, I was talking about, we were just kind of freewheeling on some topics, but there were a couple of thoughts that have been swirling in my head lately.

469
00:42:16,643 --> 00:42:22,745
[SPEAKER_12]: One, and it was mostly about the different ways we can be looking forward to next year.

470
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:34,902
[SPEAKER_12]: thinking about how to support students at different levels, coming off of this year, however next year is going to look like, whatever that's going to be.

471
00:42:36,645 --> 00:42:40,129
[SPEAKER_12]: I just, I'm a planner by heart, and so I think

472
00:42:41,090 --> 00:43:05,783
[SPEAKER_12]: part of my frustrations with this year has been and I'm sure part of the administration's frustrations this year has been just the fly by the seat of our pants kind of operation model and I would my fervent hope would be next year could still be a disaster but we could maybe plan a little just a little bit more for for doing something that we know is most likely going to happen which is

473
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:12,557
[SPEAKER_12]: that a lot of our children, a lot of the children in the district have had various levels of trauma.

474
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:21,027
[SPEAKER_12]: This year, and various levels of backsliding on behavioral health and disability issues.

475
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:22,489
[SPEAKER_12]: So, one of

476
00:43:23,738 --> 00:43:30,525
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's frustrating as a parent with a child who has behavioral health issues and emotional support issues.

477
00:43:32,046 --> 00:43:34,669
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm concerned about their reintegration.

478
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,552
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm concerned about their ability to

479
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:42,214
[SPEAKER_12]: be in a peer-to-peer classroom again.

480
00:43:42,674 --> 00:43:44,794
[SPEAKER_12]: So my second grader is fully remote.

481
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,775
[SPEAKER_12]: And I did that mostly because of the mask.

482
00:43:49,135 --> 00:43:53,256
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't think it would be fair to him to have to follow rules.

483
00:43:53,436 --> 00:44:00,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Rule following is sometimes difficult for him, and the kind of sensory thing.

484
00:44:00,377 --> 00:44:04,478
[SPEAKER_12]: So I made that decision, but that also comes with the downside that

485
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:16,501
[SPEAKER_12]: He's significantly now lacking in peer conversation skills and peer relationship skills and peer-to-peer understanding.

486
00:44:16,761 --> 00:44:21,742
[SPEAKER_12]: And I see on his remote classroom, they're getting really testy with each other.

487
00:44:22,322 --> 00:44:24,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Their tolerance for each other is going down.

488
00:44:25,873 --> 00:44:44,188
[SPEAKER_12]: And I started worrying about this for when they go back into the classroom, especially for neuro different children that are experiencing stress so that's where I was coming into and so part of my question is, I would really hope to encourage and like to see the district at large, start talking about it now.

489
00:44:45,129 --> 00:45:05,771
[SPEAKER_12]: because there are parents like me who who are getting jittery now about what it is going to look like when we go back to school or what next year is going to look like and I think we would we would much rather feel we want to be working together and I think if we could start hearing some of those plans and discussions and

490
00:45:06,532 --> 00:45:24,557
[SPEAKER_12]: knowing, and I know it's in the forefront of your minds, I'm not suggesting it's not at all, but hearing that, hearing that mental health and supportive health and emotional and behavioral health is critical and is paramount to the school's understanding of the whole child.

491
00:45:25,317 --> 00:45:31,579
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you would, I think a lot of parents, regardless of whether they have children on 504s, IAPs or in special ed,

492
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:38,460
[SPEAKER_12]: would like to hear that because there's been a lot of varying degrees of trauma.

493
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:47,805
[SPEAKER_12]: And then one of the ways I was thinking about this was as a PTO kind of hat was actionable things.

494
00:45:47,885 --> 00:45:59,171
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's the myriad of ways you can approach mental behavioral and social emotional problems are way beyond my pay grade.

495
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:07,902
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to think of ways as a PTO president and as a parent, I can help have actionable intent for the district.

496
00:46:08,043 --> 00:46:18,586
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the things I was thinking about, actually, it was Amanda Gorman that sparked this in me, which was because Amanda Gorman came to the middle school last year to talk about being poet laureate.

497
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:24,268
[SPEAKER_12]: And hilariously, we were actually booking her until she suddenly became not very available.

498
00:46:26,418 --> 00:46:30,820
[SPEAKER_12]: But that whole thing got me thinking about art therapy and art and music therapy.

499
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:43,965
[SPEAKER_12]: How important creative art is going to be, help children with emotions they may have, the issues they may have, the family strife, whatever they have had.

500
00:46:45,626 --> 00:46:48,047
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought it would also be a

501
00:46:49,683 --> 00:46:59,091
[SPEAKER_12]: a good approach in for as a community-based thing, as a parent, parents need art therapy, like, I just, I have no concept of what that means.

502
00:46:59,411 --> 00:47:01,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I have no connections whatsoever.

503
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:10,541
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just trying to think of something that seemed tangible, actionable, and fundable through grants, and in a way that parents might connect with.

504
00:47:11,742 --> 00:47:14,605
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I was talking about that, and Mellie offered me to come and

505
00:47:15,616 --> 00:47:16,356
[SPEAKER_12]: lay it all down.

506
00:47:18,197 --> 00:47:19,697
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and that's kind of why I was here.

507
00:47:20,677 --> 00:47:21,497
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Claire.

508
00:47:21,537 --> 00:47:24,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, um, it was brought up in the PTO.

509
00:47:24,158 --> 00:47:32,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was funny, because I think Mr. Tutu was saying that, yeah, you guys had, you know, he had been emailing or something with Amanda Gorman.

510
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,941
[SPEAKER_02]: And then suddenly, her people started contacting him, which was really funny.

511
00:47:38,602 --> 00:47:42,823
[SPEAKER_02]: But Miss Galussi, just in one second, but I wanted to say thank you.

512
00:47:42,883 --> 00:47:43,623
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to say,

513
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:53,008
[SPEAKER_02]: that we did have a parent, as we mentioned in the PTO, who worked on a grant for the preschool last year for music therapy.

514
00:47:53,048 --> 00:47:54,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really, really well-received.

515
00:47:55,888 --> 00:47:58,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I also just wanted to circle back to Susanna for one second.

516
00:47:58,569 --> 00:48:00,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Susanna, and I know Carla has one more thing to say.

517
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:09,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think, Claire, you provided us this really nice bridge from special education or through special education into the behavioral health piece.

518
00:48:09,692 --> 00:48:11,212
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much for doing that.

519
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:14,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Stacey's going to jump in in a second as well.

520
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,580
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really helpful.

521
00:48:16,081 --> 00:48:19,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so glad that you were able to be here and talk about this because it's super important.

522
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:24,366
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, for every kid, for our neurodivergent kids and for every kid.

523
00:48:25,807 --> 00:48:31,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And the music therapy went, I know really well, personally, we've had outside music therapy for Grace.

524
00:48:32,011 --> 00:48:33,252
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been exceptional.

525
00:48:34,062 --> 00:48:37,485
[SPEAKER_02]: um, in terms of self-regulation and, um, behavior regulation.

526
00:48:37,765 --> 00:48:49,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, for every kid, um, and Susanna, if you, I was going to say, um, if there are evaluations or exit interviews from the disability awareness curriculum, it would be really great for, um, this subcommittee to see them.

527
00:48:49,615 --> 00:48:55,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think also for the curriculum subcommittee to see them, if you would, that would be really helpful, um, if you wouldn't mind.

528
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:59,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, Carla had one more thing to say, and then I'd love to hear from Ms.

529
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Galussi and, um, and Stacey Schulman.

530
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:02,526
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

531
00:49:02,936 --> 00:49:04,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Susanna, did you have something you wanted to respond to?

532
00:49:05,217 --> 00:49:06,737
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just was going to say that's fine.

533
00:49:06,897 --> 00:49:10,018
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll make sure that I make those available to the committee.

534
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:14,020
[SPEAKER_08]: And just one other follow up to Katie, who had brought up the books.

535
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,781
[SPEAKER_08]: The district did purchase all of the books that were on that list.

536
00:49:19,662 --> 00:49:21,482
[SPEAKER_08]: So we do have those in district.

537
00:49:21,502 --> 00:49:23,883
[SPEAKER_08]: They were purchased through Joan Bowen's office.

538
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:25,544
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are available.

539
00:49:25,744 --> 00:49:31,566
[SPEAKER_08]: And one last thing is that one of the participants in the course is a school librarian.

540
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:55,738
[SPEAKER_08]: in Medford and she actually created a whole document that was her final project of different disability related books that have positive representations of students with disabilities across all grade levels so that's awesome it'll be something that we will have as a resource but that's it i'm all done thank you thank you carla you wanted to add one more thing yeah i just want to um can you hear me okay

541
00:49:56,821 --> 00:50:00,324
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I just wanted to make sure we don't lose sight of the inclusion aspect.

542
00:50:00,344 --> 00:50:02,466
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're talking a lot about disability awareness.

543
00:50:02,526 --> 00:50:06,770
[SPEAKER_15]: And it seems like we're almost informing students who don't have disabilities.

544
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:12,956
[SPEAKER_15]: And it almost, you know, I just don't want to feel like we're putting students on a panel and asking them questions about their disability.

545
00:50:12,996 --> 00:50:20,082
[SPEAKER_15]: But what I did kind of pick up today, again, during the course before this, and Charlotte, I think you'll really appreciate it.

546
00:50:21,276 --> 00:50:27,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of us wrote lesson plans from a perspective of self-determination and self-advocacy, which is disability awareness as well.

547
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:38,665
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's going to be the inclusion piece where students with a disability are learning what accommodations help them and their strengths and weaknesses as well as students without a disability.

548
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:41,647
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that we can cover the inclusion piece with that topic.

549
00:50:44,749 --> 00:50:45,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

550
00:50:45,229 --> 00:50:46,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Self-advocacy is critical.

551
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:50,732
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I have to be reminded often that Gracie's 13 and really

552
00:50:51,169 --> 00:50:54,511
[SPEAKER_02]: coming into her own with her own voice and I should not be speaking on behalf of her.

553
00:50:54,551 --> 00:51:01,454
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to qualify that when I speak, I'm speaking as a parent, not as a person with a disability in this particular role.

554
00:51:01,494 --> 00:51:03,775
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that reminder, Carla.

555
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:05,416
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I apologize, Ms.

556
00:51:05,436 --> 00:51:10,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Galussi, Tanya has been trying to get me through text because she's not able

557
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:17,264
[SPEAKER_07]: to unmute and- I can now, I think Peter had fixed it, so I'm good.

558
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:20,227
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually didn't have anything to say that I sent you that a while ago.

559
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:21,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, I just saw it.

560
00:51:21,909 --> 00:51:22,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what?

561
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, thank you.

562
00:51:24,212 --> 00:51:24,612
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Ms.

563
00:51:24,632 --> 00:51:25,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Glucy, please.

564
00:51:26,117 --> 00:51:29,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, thank you and I can't believe that Gracie is an official teenager.

565
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:31,242
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my goodness.

566
00:51:31,362 --> 00:51:31,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

567
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:46,117
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I just wanted to speak, following Claire clarity just to, I'm not quite sure if she was able to join the school committee meeting on Monday but Dr. Cushing and I did present that we're starting the.

568
00:51:47,138 --> 00:51:53,224
[SPEAKER_13]: in March with some listening sessions because we are beginning the process to plan for next year.

569
00:51:53,704 --> 00:51:57,648
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want you to know that, you know, I'm a parent too.

570
00:51:57,668 --> 00:52:01,591
[SPEAKER_13]: I have two high schoolers and one's doing quite well.

571
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:03,033
[SPEAKER_13]: She could learn in a paper bag.

572
00:52:03,213 --> 00:52:06,856
[SPEAKER_13]: And my other student is, it's been a very, very difficult year.

573
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:08,758
[SPEAKER_13]: So she's struggling a great deal.

574
00:52:09,418 --> 00:52:11,999
[SPEAKER_13]: So I bring that piece to this too.

575
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,341
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that the planning has to start now.

576
00:52:14,421 --> 00:52:15,761
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it has to be purposeful.

577
00:52:16,422 --> 00:52:22,185
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the SEL piece is something that is very forefront for all of us.

578
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:29,188
[SPEAKER_13]: As a matter of fact, part of that is the planning that we've been doing in collaboration with Stacy.

579
00:52:30,729 --> 00:52:44,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Who can you know chime in at any point about this but some of the things we're talking about is how we're going to successfully use the summer to also capture some of these students that are struggling academically as well as struggling socially emotionally, what we can do to.

580
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:50,755
[SPEAKER_13]: help the transition to be as smooth as possible to get them back in the building next year.

581
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:53,977
[SPEAKER_13]: We know that we're not going to be able to like snap our fingers.

582
00:52:54,017 --> 00:53:02,383
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's not going to happen with my daughter that next year just because schools can hopefully you know reopen that things are going to be seamless.

583
00:53:02,863 --> 00:53:06,566
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're starting the listening sessions in March because we want to hear from staff.

584
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:07,827
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to hear from families.

585
00:53:07,867 --> 00:53:08,848
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to hear from students.

586
00:53:09,368 --> 00:53:17,898
[SPEAKER_13]: We're including the students in these listening sessions as well to get people's perspective and input on how were their experiences this year.

587
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:26,449
[SPEAKER_13]: That communication is going to go out broadly to the community next week so that people can plan accordingly and put it on their calendars.

588
00:53:27,209 --> 00:53:30,751
[SPEAKER_13]: But I know at the elementary level, it's that first week in March.

589
00:53:31,691 --> 00:53:37,534
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just the first part of the work we have to do in planning the reopening for next year.

590
00:53:38,054 --> 00:53:42,456
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we'll move into the nitty gritty plans.

591
00:53:42,536 --> 00:53:52,161
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just wanted to let you know that it is forefront in our minds, and we are going to be quite purposeful about it, thinking about the whole child.

592
00:53:53,141 --> 00:53:54,922
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really crucial that we have to plan for

593
00:53:55,342 --> 00:53:56,623
[SPEAKER_13]: everything that's going on right now.

594
00:53:57,704 --> 00:53:59,806
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't doubt that at all.

595
00:53:59,826 --> 00:54:00,527
[SPEAKER_12]: I really don't.

596
00:54:02,488 --> 00:54:03,369
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I would.

597
00:54:03,469 --> 00:54:03,890
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't.

598
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:08,313
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would encourage you to over-communicate that.

599
00:54:10,415 --> 00:54:17,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever you think your communication level of that message is, turn it up an extra dial.

600
00:54:18,535 --> 00:54:26,238
[SPEAKER_12]: because I think it's parents, and you would know too as a parent too, our brains are so scrambled right now.

601
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:38,843
[SPEAKER_12]: It needs to be a really loud message that the social and emotional and the transition period we know is going, like we need it so loud that we hear that you hear us.

602
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:40,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that make sense?

603
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:56,592
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, it's almost like where, where the kids again where we need the reinforcement constantly to to know that we know that you know it intuitively, but I think we just need to hear it louder, and so that we can.

604
00:54:57,802 --> 00:55:14,512
[SPEAKER_12]: start to have our comfort level come back, so that we can relax, just a little bit so we can help because I think, as I'm sure everyone here would agree we're all so stressed out and concerned and frazzled that it's, I worry how, how

605
00:55:15,332 --> 00:55:20,975
[SPEAKER_12]: cooperative that's going to be, unless we feel kind of like padded a little bit.

606
00:55:21,896 --> 00:55:23,657
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know that you know that.

607
00:55:23,697 --> 00:55:30,981
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to make sure that you were giving yourselves the credit for wanting to do that work and making sure all parents knew about it.

608
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:32,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Claire.

609
00:55:32,882 --> 00:55:40,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think that it's really important, as Miss Glusi was saying, for student engagement and student involvement and family and community engagement,

610
00:55:41,076 --> 00:56:07,668
[SPEAKER_02]: around this and I was listening to NPR earlier today and Paul Revel was on with Jim Brody and Marjorie Egan and he was talking about the new level of family and community engagement and how he wants to see it be sustainable and evolve and that any district that thinks that they're going to be able to go back to the way that it was pre-COVID is wrong and that they're just not going to move forward, that the parents have become

611
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:21,041
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the teachers in a lot of ways as well, with the remote learning, especially, and that to really good leaders are gonna capitalize on that family and community engagement, and they're gonna really figure out how to move that forward.

612
00:56:21,081 --> 00:56:25,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a really important piece, and the student piece is a really important piece.

613
00:56:25,762 --> 00:56:36,285
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also wanna share that the student education talk show, Medford Community Media's Ed Talk will start up again next week, and we are gonna have seniors come in

614
00:56:36,772 --> 00:56:43,497
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to be talking about what their experience has been like from a pandemic perspective in class.

615
00:56:43,598 --> 00:56:56,668
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also think, you know, advising sort of the other students, the juniors and the sophomores and the younger sort of kids, too, is to going back to school starting next year, I think that they look peer to peer as well.

616
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:58,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that piece is really important.

617
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:01,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd love to hear from Stacey Shulman on some of this, please.

618
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:03,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, good evening.

619
00:57:04,961 --> 00:57:10,424
[SPEAKER_06]: So I certainly think that social emotional well being is is at the forefront of all of our minds.

620
00:57:11,785 --> 00:57:15,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly we're having a lot of conversations about planning for next year and

621
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,410
[SPEAKER_06]: in making sure, as Ms.

622
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:28,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Glucy said, to include the voices of everyone in the community, because the one thing that I have a firm grasp on is no one's experience has been the same through this.

623
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:43,097
[SPEAKER_06]: So whether you're a student, a staff member, an administrator, as far up as it goes, everyone has been affected, but everyone's experience and interpretation of the COVID pandemic is very different.

624
00:57:44,943 --> 00:57:53,509
[SPEAKER_06]: What we do have a firm understanding on is that school at the beginning of the year cannot look the same as it has every year.

625
00:57:54,350 --> 00:58:02,496
[SPEAKER_06]: And what sort of accommodations do we need to make so that it's as supportive for students as possible?

626
00:58:03,197 --> 00:58:10,503
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing right now a lot of preparation in terms of preparing our staff with professional development.

627
00:58:11,945 --> 00:58:19,371
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 of our school social workers became certified anxiety specialists, child and adolescent anxiety specialists this year.

628
00:58:19,411 --> 00:58:22,934
[SPEAKER_06]: That was really important as anxiety really spiked during the pandemic.

629
00:58:23,535 --> 00:58:29,299
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be training 10 to 15 clinicians to be certified trauma specialists as well.

630
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:35,845
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that'll be really helpful in terms of increasing their professional knowledge with that certification.

631
00:58:36,362 --> 00:58:41,945
[SPEAKER_06]: but additionally being able to provide resources and support to other staff members and increasing their knowledge.

632
00:58:43,025 --> 00:58:51,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that, you know, students have also shown an incredible amount of resilience in this, as well as an incredible amount of openness.

633
00:58:52,189 --> 00:58:56,751
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're sort of willing to engage in a lot of ways that we offer them.

634
00:58:57,131 --> 00:59:03,434
[SPEAKER_06]: And we just need to keep listening and providing support the best way we can.

635
00:59:03,454 --> 00:59:04,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a,

636
00:59:06,222 --> 00:59:13,523
[SPEAKER_06]: really interesting conversation earlier today with an empathy expert, Michael Tennant.

637
00:59:13,943 --> 00:59:20,104
[SPEAKER_06]: He was recently featured in the New York Times and we were very lucky to get time with him for about an hour.

638
00:59:20,124 --> 00:59:25,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And he created this card game called Actually Curious.

639
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:35,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And what it does is his goal is to like increase empathy and to reduce divisiveness, but it provides a lot of information in terms of

640
00:59:35,661 --> 00:59:45,188
[SPEAKER_06]: how people connect with one another, how to have really honest conversations that include active listening and not necessarily response all of the time.

641
00:59:45,328 --> 00:59:52,312
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping to foster some of that in our schools, certainly this spring as we head into planning for the fall.

642
00:59:52,433 --> 00:59:54,854
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm happy to answer any specific questions.

643
00:59:54,934 --> 00:59:57,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love your suggestion about art therapy.

644
00:59:58,016 --> 00:59:59,677
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been trying to get it for years.

645
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:03,460
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very expensive and it's,

646
01:00:04,965 --> 01:00:08,808
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a little bit difficult to fit into the schedule.

647
01:00:08,928 --> 01:00:16,695
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had some counselors who are also art therapists and were able to engage that in their practice.

648
01:00:17,235 --> 01:00:22,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I always wanted to have an afterschool club run by an art therapist so that students had a choice for that.

649
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:30,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll certainly be looking for grant opportunities or volunteer or whatever I can to foster that going forward.

650
01:00:31,507 --> 01:00:32,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks Stacey.

651
01:00:36,293 --> 01:00:37,054
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I want to say that.

652
01:00:37,214 --> 01:00:45,424
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's really great to have all these specialists like mental health specialists and people that are trained working with our kids.

653
01:00:45,464 --> 01:00:50,690
[SPEAKER_18]: But at the same time, I think there should be like a district wide.

654
01:00:51,090 --> 01:00:52,191
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to make a decision.

655
01:00:52,472 --> 01:00:53,613
[SPEAKER_18]: What is our priority?

656
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:55,996
[SPEAKER_18]: Because my fear is that next year,

657
01:00:56,617 --> 01:00:57,738
[SPEAKER_18]: is going to be this race.

658
01:00:57,918 --> 01:01:07,906
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, assuming we're all back in school, it's going to be this race that these kids need to recoup everything that they, you know, lost academically and we're going to end up putting even more stress on them.

659
01:01:07,926 --> 01:01:18,815
[SPEAKER_18]: And, you know, I love the art therapy and the music therapy, but even simple things like let them be outside more, like, you know, talk to the general teachers and let them

660
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:22,449
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, rub heads again and look at the box.

661
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:29,073
[SPEAKER_18]: And not only elementary school, but I'm thinking middle school, high school, like we need to go easy on the kids.

662
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:37,639
[SPEAKER_18]: And also we need to go easy on the parents too, because I have to tell that I live in fear that next year I'm going to be back to having three hours of homework every night.

663
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:44,143
[SPEAKER_18]: And I kind of enjoy being able to enjoy my kid in the afternoon.

664
01:01:44,183 --> 01:01:49,247
[SPEAKER_18]: So just, yeah, just, it needs to be a district-wide thinking about this.

665
01:01:50,725 --> 01:01:51,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Alec, Dr. Cushing.

666
01:01:52,966 --> 01:01:58,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're also in the initial stages of planning our summer work this year for learning recovery.

667
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:10,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things in our initial discussions is exactly that, having a lot of outdoor activities, a lot of outdoor learning, ways that we can engage students in the natural environment surrounding the schools.

668
01:02:11,418 --> 01:02:16,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And so just so you're aware, that is something that we are going to be working diligently to make happen.

669
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:23,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

670
01:02:26,635 --> 01:02:27,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Rousseau.

671
01:02:28,717 --> 01:02:29,478
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

672
01:02:30,019 --> 01:02:42,973
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue of homework, I think many issues that have received various levels of attention and had years of, you know, parents and teachers and administrators and

673
01:02:44,622 --> 01:02:48,044
[SPEAKER_03]: academics who do research and talk about best practices.

674
01:02:48,064 --> 01:03:06,652
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I feel like public education, K to 12, not just public education, has been slow to move on things that once things were even proven, frankly, beyond a reasonable doubt, I mean, sort of the American tradition, just like global warming and everything else.

675
01:03:08,052 --> 01:03:09,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just wondering about,

676
01:03:10,627 --> 01:03:27,278
[SPEAKER_03]: if the administration has been talking about any kinds of major shifts on any big things that, you know, where resistance might come from on any particular topic varies greatly.

677
01:03:27,398 --> 01:03:34,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Equitable grading, you know, everybody is very clear that teachers will very strongly resist shifts in how we do grading.

678
01:03:35,867 --> 01:03:44,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Homework is something that parents and some teachers will have strong opinions on, but I feel like we've sort of blown the whole thing up.

679
01:03:46,410 --> 01:04:05,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we start putting it back together, do we just put it back together the way it was, or do we look at things like equitable grading, you know, major topics that have sort of swirled around, but been too big for us to consider as a district, and not just Medford, of course,

680
01:04:06,395 --> 01:04:18,043
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the homework one in particular, you know, my son, until a doctor told us that is actually insane for a second grader to be spending several hours on homework.

681
01:04:18,744 --> 01:04:19,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how would we have known?

682
01:04:19,664 --> 01:04:24,908
[SPEAKER_03]: He was our first, he was our eldest, and we were just doing what we were supposed to do, right?

683
01:04:27,049 --> 01:04:29,511
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just wondering if the administration, Ms.

684
01:04:29,531 --> 01:04:29,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Bowen,

685
01:04:32,373 --> 01:04:59,128
[SPEAKER_03]: not it's not really to me it's not a special ed specific thing but um it sometimes it feels like things can take a higher the heat can be raised significantly none of my son's teachers in second grade thought they had him sitting at the table for hours every night none of them and so it's not that the teachers were doing anything wrong uh but you know the system was designed around you know the

686
01:04:59,782 --> 01:05:00,563
[SPEAKER_03]: What does the teacher think?

687
01:05:00,783 --> 01:05:02,785
[SPEAKER_03]: How much time should homework should take?

688
01:05:04,246 --> 01:05:05,747
[SPEAKER_03]: No relationship to reality.

689
01:05:05,767 --> 01:05:09,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people might take five minutes and others might take an hour.

690
01:05:11,352 --> 01:05:21,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm wondering if the administration does have any major topics that they're looking at for when we put this back together or is the goal to put it back together the way it was?

691
01:05:22,681 --> 01:05:27,385
[SPEAKER_01]: So we definitely have to work at putting it back together and we need to make data informed

692
01:05:28,014 --> 01:05:40,584
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions, but I can also say we do believe in differentiation and we heard talk about UDL and being able to appropriately meet the needs of students.

693
01:05:41,945 --> 01:05:43,266
[SPEAKER_01]: Students learn differently.

694
01:05:44,046 --> 01:05:53,874
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are a lot of things that it can't be a one size fits all solution for every single student in a given classroom.

695
01:05:54,374 --> 01:05:56,556
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are things that we do need to

696
01:05:58,057 --> 01:06:01,239
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously take you know into consideration.

697
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:12,468
[SPEAKER_01]: As we move forward, we know that things are going to be different things are are incredibly different right now, and we as adults, we're still adjusting to that.

698
01:06:13,048 --> 01:06:13,248
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

699
01:06:15,129 --> 01:06:17,531
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think, as we look at the data.

700
01:06:18,512 --> 01:06:23,437
[SPEAKER_01]: As we look at the, the challenges we look at what worked well what didn't work well.

701
01:06:24,698 --> 01:06:28,202
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that, we're going to be gathering information next month.

702
01:06:28,742 --> 01:06:35,469
[SPEAKER_01]: During the listening sessions to really be able to listen to what's being said so that it can help to inform.

703
01:06:38,803 --> 01:06:46,930
[SPEAKER_01]: What we need to do for the start of the school year, and we are continuing to also receive additional guidance from the state.

704
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:52,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we had, you know, over 600 people on the call with the commissioner.

705
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:53,015
[SPEAKER_01]: So,

706
01:06:55,557 --> 01:07:03,020
[SPEAKER_01]: there may be official shifts that are being presented for all districts to take into consideration for next year.

707
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:23,228
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely on our radar, and we are very, very aware that things will look differently, but we need to make those final decisions once we have more information, more data, and, you know, working collaboratively come to

708
01:07:24,697 --> 01:07:26,998
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations for next school year.

709
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:29,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

710
01:07:29,818 --> 01:07:43,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really critical to, as Claire was mentioning around the, and as you guys were mentioning around the listening sessions, I think it would be really great to also have student listening sessions.

711
01:07:43,762 --> 01:07:51,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're having family listening sessions, but it just, you know, as we're, and again, it's a bigger committee thing, and I know it's more time for folks as well.

712
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:53,281
[SPEAKER_04]: We already have them scheduled.

713
01:07:53,661 --> 01:07:54,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.

714
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:59,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe they're like 3.30 to 4.30 on all the days that they're scheduled.

715
01:07:59,987 --> 01:08:00,727
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

716
01:08:01,428 --> 01:08:02,969
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love to hear more about that.

717
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:06,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't take people's time up now, but I think that that's really critical.

718
01:08:06,072 --> 01:08:07,913
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that.

719
01:08:08,073 --> 01:08:19,183
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with regard to Claire and the art therapy piece, I think that being able to even do a little bit of research, I can definitely

720
01:08:19,918 --> 01:08:26,160
[SPEAKER_02]: know, look at Roman music therapy and sort of talk to the previous parent and some of the grant that was created around that.

721
01:08:26,180 --> 01:08:27,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be curious about what that is.

722
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:41,063
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I think about building resources like Susanna has been doing with the disability awareness, right, is building resources as well as Stacey is around the mental health, thinking about what grants are available for, you know, the social emotional piece.

723
01:08:41,103 --> 01:08:46,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, social emotional has been the big, you know, buzzword both at the federal and state level, right?

724
01:08:47,005 --> 01:08:47,665
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's got to be

725
01:08:49,374 --> 01:08:50,494
[SPEAKER_02]: grant money around this.

726
01:08:50,574 --> 01:08:58,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, building sort of an understanding of what those are and how they might be applied is, I think, a great approach.

727
01:08:58,396 --> 01:08:59,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear what you think, Stacey.

728
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:03,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I love art therapy.

729
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:06,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Lesley University is right in our backyard.

730
01:09:06,237 --> 01:09:07,717
[SPEAKER_06]: They have an art therapy program.

731
01:09:07,757 --> 01:09:12,658
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been lucky to have interns who have worked with us as well.

732
01:09:12,678 --> 01:09:16,919
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the challenge is

733
01:09:19,386 --> 01:09:26,769
[SPEAKER_06]: is more of the scheduling and when does that occur during the day so that students can access it in a way that's meaningful.

734
01:09:26,989 --> 01:09:31,911
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really challenging to have productive art therapy under an hour.

735
01:09:31,931 --> 01:09:45,696
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think that it's just looking at what our options are and perhaps we can pilot something and then move it forward in the later years or

736
01:09:47,673 --> 01:09:49,215
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, create an afterschool club.

737
01:09:49,275 --> 01:09:56,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are things that come to mind off the top of my head or putting it in the advisory or the wind blocks.

738
01:09:56,524 --> 01:10:04,133
[SPEAKER_06]: But I certainly think providing more opportunities that are therapeutic that don't look like classic group therapies are really important for our students.

739
01:10:06,111 --> 01:10:08,012
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can be really creative in those ways too.

740
01:10:08,092 --> 01:10:21,920
[SPEAKER_06]: We had years ago when Dr. Perrella was here, he had meditation experts come in and we had one of them come through one of their connections, come to a CPAC meeting and that was really helpful.

741
01:10:23,281 --> 01:10:28,804
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are definitely a lot of options that are creative that we could utilize.

742
01:10:28,884 --> 01:10:34,287
[SPEAKER_06]: We just have to think about a meaningful way to create community partnerships that are effective and efficient

743
01:10:35,267 --> 01:10:37,688
[SPEAKER_06]: in our schools and serve as many students as possible.

744
01:10:40,429 --> 01:10:40,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

745
01:10:40,929 --> 01:10:41,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's really great.

746
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:54,594
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that there's, you know, opportunities I would love to see too, as we're talking about family and community engagement, Dr. Edward Vincent, thinking about the expertise that we have in the community and tapping into some of that.

747
01:10:54,634 --> 01:11:00,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's certainly, Heather's not on tonight, but Heather Ruminap, who is a licensed social worker,

748
01:11:01,501 --> 01:11:09,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Stacey, who has been on these meetings, all of our meetings in the past, you know, has offered support, advice, services, you know, multiple times in the past.

749
01:11:09,708 --> 01:11:27,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that we've taken her up on any of it, but especially as we're thinking about, you know, afterschool programs or what have you, there's a lot of people in the community who are very invested in our students' mental health and thinking about, you know, I think it's partly around the organizing and what that could look like.

750
01:11:27,944 --> 01:11:29,385
[SPEAKER_02]: And then thinking back to

751
01:11:30,630 --> 01:11:40,234
[SPEAKER_02]: my policy class, you know, from graduate school a couple of years ago too, it's sort of tackling this in the, in the, in the trifold, if you will, sort of, what are the, what are the barriers to this happening?

752
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:45,556
[SPEAKER_02]: So schedule certainly always, you know, financial and organizing and resources.

753
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:53,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we're looking at that sort of triangle of how we answer those three pieces, then it's sort of a way in which these can be tackled.

754
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:58,722
[SPEAKER_02]: But I appreciate hearing, especially the listening sessions, but I also appreciate hearing what's happening

755
01:11:59,318 --> 01:12:15,132
[SPEAKER_02]: In-house, I think what I'm also hearing from Claire and from others is how we integrate the family and community engagement piece into it so that the communication is, again, really loud and turned up, and they feel like they're being involved in the process.

756
01:12:15,632 --> 01:12:17,514
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I'd love to hear what other folks think.

757
01:12:17,554 --> 01:12:18,855
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my perspective.

758
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:42,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Is everybody talked out now?

759
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:45,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much right before vacation.

760
01:12:46,414 --> 01:12:47,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel Yeah, I gotta go.

761
01:12:47,635 --> 01:12:50,477
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a little girl puppy downstairs to cuddle and love.

762
01:12:50,557 --> 01:12:52,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm feeling the same guys.

763
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna put it out there again.

764
01:12:56,621 --> 01:12:57,942
[SPEAKER_02]: I know somebody just came in.

765
01:12:57,962 --> 01:12:58,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if

766
01:12:59,232 --> 01:13:00,394
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to say hello or not.

767
01:13:00,434 --> 01:13:02,797
[SPEAKER_02]: But Sarah, if you want to say hello, please feel free.

768
01:13:02,857 --> 01:13:04,179
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, we can update you later.

769
01:13:06,121 --> 01:13:07,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, as always.

770
01:13:07,704 --> 01:13:13,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone else that has any sort of final comments as we're going into this February vacation week?

771
01:13:18,664 --> 01:13:20,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I'm getting that the final comment.

772
01:13:20,425 --> 01:13:24,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Stacey, I was gonna say I'm getting that the final comment is let's get a motion to adjourn.

773
01:13:24,766 --> 01:13:25,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Stacey?

774
01:13:25,706 --> 01:13:33,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, but the only thing I will say is that if people are feeling like they don't have the bandwidth, they can certainly email.

775
01:13:33,969 --> 01:13:34,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

776
01:13:34,389 --> 01:13:35,569
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it, Stacey.

777
01:13:35,889 --> 01:13:37,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah, did you want to speak for a second?

778
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:41,268
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, I appreciate it.

779
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,909
[SPEAKER_18]: Mary, did you want to speak for a second?

780
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:45,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

781
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:46,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, everybody.

782
01:13:47,771 --> 01:13:48,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I was listening.

783
01:13:48,572 --> 01:13:49,952
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry I came late.

784
01:13:50,853 --> 01:13:52,574
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't hear so many of your things.

785
01:13:52,794 --> 01:14:07,201
[SPEAKER_14]: But I was thinking about the behavior specialist services, the OT, is a consultant.

786
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:08,522
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like,

787
01:14:09,222 --> 01:14:15,564
[SPEAKER_14]: with all this mess up with the COVID and all the situation, it's not good.

788
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:27,427
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see in the future if this kind of service, they can be in real time, they can stay with the kids because they need to see what is happening in the classes.

789
01:14:28,068 --> 01:14:32,169
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like, I would like to see that change.

790
01:14:33,644 --> 01:14:49,778
[SPEAKER_14]: that the patient therapies and the behaviors, they stop to be consultant because they only consult and give her advice and everything, but it's not the same to work in the real time with the kids in the real situations.

791
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,742
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one part of my comment.

792
01:14:55,023 --> 01:14:55,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Sarah.

793
01:14:55,784 --> 01:14:58,266
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sarah, you're a parent of two children.

794
01:14:58,286 --> 01:14:59,167
[SPEAKER_02]: What grades again?

795
01:15:00,168 --> 01:15:00,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me?

796
01:15:01,548 --> 01:15:02,829
[SPEAKER_02]: What grades are your children in again?

797
01:15:03,649 --> 01:15:04,729
[SPEAKER_14]: He's in a seventh grade.

798
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:10,031
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't hear you.

799
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:13,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, you have two kids in the district, right, Sarah?

800
01:15:13,973 --> 01:15:14,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

801
01:15:14,433 --> 01:15:14,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

802
01:15:14,893 --> 01:15:16,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking only about one.

803
01:15:16,434 --> 01:15:17,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I understand.

804
01:15:17,614 --> 01:15:20,495
[SPEAKER_02]: So but Sarah's a parent in the district with two children.

805
01:15:21,156 --> 01:15:24,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sarah, what I'm hearing you saying is that the behavior

806
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:40,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Support as consultant is much harder, especially during pandemic and mental health and all the behavior that we're seeing an increase in because the behaviors are coming in and out and not there on a more regular basis or a part of the district.

807
01:15:40,785 --> 01:15:41,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you're saying?

808
01:15:41,846 --> 01:15:42,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

809
01:15:42,406 --> 01:15:45,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for phrasing and explaining much better than me.

810
01:15:46,948 --> 01:15:48,588
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just wanted to make sure that I understood.

811
01:15:49,048 --> 01:15:53,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering if anyone wants to speak to that from administration.

812
01:15:54,100 --> 01:16:02,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, so from the behavioral aspect, we have four BCBAs that are Medford Public Schools employees.

813
01:16:02,245 --> 01:16:04,907
[SPEAKER_06]: They work in the district and we have a behavioral specialist as well.

814
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:12,652
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on their roles and responsibilities and what the child needs, but they do offer hands-on services as well as consultation.

815
01:16:14,373 --> 01:16:22,458
[SPEAKER_06]: It really just honestly depends on the student and the student needs and what the IEP team has decided for that role.

816
01:16:23,554 --> 01:16:28,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I understand because I was in the district for a while and I'm working in another district.

817
01:16:29,198 --> 01:16:35,182
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is my opinion that I think that they say that the teachers are resistant to change of everything.

818
01:16:35,582 --> 01:16:37,563
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is something bad for something good.

819
01:16:37,703 --> 01:16:40,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Like we need to start to make probably another change.

820
01:16:40,645 --> 01:16:47,770
[SPEAKER_14]: I think those kind of service, they need to stop to be consultants and they need to be a real position in the schools.

821
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:51,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Because more for this, what we want for a special need.

822
01:16:52,987 --> 01:16:56,470
[SPEAKER_14]: We want for all the special kids of everybody to be independent.

823
01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:04,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Taking in consideration that his disabilities, we want them to be more independent.

824
01:17:04,235 --> 01:17:16,124
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you be a consultant that you are once in a while, not very consistent, I don't think the outcomes are going to came very positive.

825
01:17:16,524 --> 01:17:20,967
[SPEAKER_14]: I talking about my experience and I see a lot of parents because I'm

826
01:17:21,374 --> 01:17:22,936
[SPEAKER_14]: join another group of parents.

827
01:17:23,016 --> 01:17:32,706
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel like we have very similar ideas that some kind of thing they need to change.

828
01:17:32,766 --> 01:17:35,870
[SPEAKER_14]: And probably this one is an opportunity to make that change.

829
01:17:37,143 --> 01:17:43,525
[SPEAKER_14]: to give more service, more real service in hand because it's very hard for us.

830
01:17:43,605 --> 01:17:49,927
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to work so hard, you know, and I'm trying to work with the district and sometimes I'm mad and blah, blah, blah.

831
01:17:50,407 --> 01:17:55,049
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, I know you are doing your part, I'm doing my part, but we need more.

832
01:17:55,969 --> 01:17:56,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

833
01:17:56,709 --> 01:17:57,289
[SPEAKER_14]: We need more.

834
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:58,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Sarah.

835
01:17:58,930 --> 01:18:05,472
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, so what I'm hearing from administration too is for full-time BCBAs is that

836
01:18:06,274 --> 01:18:09,815
[SPEAKER_02]: a student ratio of roughly 4,000, is that right?

837
01:18:12,416 --> 01:18:16,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have around 4,200 students.

838
01:18:16,697 --> 01:18:18,318
[SPEAKER_06]: Behavior specialists as well.

839
01:18:18,798 --> 01:18:19,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

840
01:18:19,558 --> 01:18:28,240
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course we have school adjustment counselors that offer behavioral support, school psychologists offer behavioral support, paraprofessionals offer behavioral support.

841
01:18:30,001 --> 01:18:33,402
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that we have grown by at least

842
01:18:34,271 --> 01:18:38,172
[SPEAKER_06]: three BCBAs in my nine years that I've been here.

843
01:18:38,212 --> 01:18:39,492
[SPEAKER_06]: We had one previously.

844
01:18:39,872 --> 01:18:41,733
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've increased that over time.

845
01:18:41,753 --> 01:18:52,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, it's always something that we're looking to expand upon, but we have done quite a bit of growth in the past few years in that area.

846
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:56,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.

847
01:18:56,857 --> 01:19:01,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess if parents are feeling like they're, I mean, it sounds to me like there are more parents, obviously,

848
01:19:01,912 --> 01:19:05,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah than just yourself that are feeling, you know, the difficulty around this.

849
01:19:05,436 --> 01:19:15,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think so many of us are with the COVID pandemic as well and seeing this exacerbated behavior in particular, exacerbated with all of this in the pandemic.

850
01:19:15,285 --> 01:19:21,612
[SPEAKER_02]: So if families are feeling like they really need more support and more help, what would the next steps be?

851
01:19:22,392 --> 01:19:24,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan or Dr. Edward Vincent or Stacey?

852
01:19:25,597 --> 01:19:27,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I can speak to that.

853
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:41,494
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing I did want to say is, as students get older within the school system, we want them to be more independent with the skills that they've learned so that's why we move to more of a consultant model with ot pt that sort of thing.

854
01:19:41,935 --> 01:19:45,579
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're feeling that your child is requiring more services.

855
01:19:46,079 --> 01:20:08,340
[SPEAKER_09]: As a parent, you have a right to request a team meeting at any time, and you have a voice as a member of the team to talk about what's working, what's not working, why you feel that maybe more in-person services or direct services are needed, and the team can have a discussion about that and see if it's warranted and if that should be put on the child's IEP.

856
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,223
[SPEAKER_09]: But as children get older, we do want them

857
01:20:11,663 --> 01:20:20,173
[SPEAKER_09]: to be able to generalize the skills that they've learned through the direct model and then move to the consult model.

858
01:20:20,213 --> 01:20:31,186
[SPEAKER_09]: But like I said, you have that right to request a meeting through your evaluation team leader at your building, at your child's school, and you can have a discussion about that.

859
01:20:33,491 --> 01:20:54,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Excuse me, yes, I understand that position and I know it's something personal, but in general, this is my personal view and I work for another district and my vision is like the servers, they need to be more stable positions because I was working in another district.

860
01:20:54,942 --> 01:20:59,044
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I'm not a teacher, I'm a aid, but I see

861
01:20:59,801 --> 01:21:05,483
[SPEAKER_14]: that kind, I don't say it's bad, but that kind of helicopter service is not good.

862
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:08,460
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not talking about my son.

863
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,081
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm talking about other people.

864
01:21:11,922 --> 01:21:15,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Only it's an idea that I know it's not easy.

865
01:21:15,363 --> 01:21:16,984
[SPEAKER_14]: I know everything is about money.

866
01:21:17,424 --> 01:21:18,585
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about finance.

867
01:21:18,605 --> 01:21:20,066
[SPEAKER_14]: It's about, I understand.

868
01:21:20,526 --> 01:21:21,947
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think we need to say it.

869
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:23,488
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not only about my son.

870
01:21:23,948 --> 01:21:24,928
[SPEAKER_14]: It's in general.

871
01:21:25,289 --> 01:21:31,472
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the behavior is the main problem of almost everybody.

872
01:21:32,072 --> 01:21:33,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Almost everybody.

873
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:37,175
[SPEAKER_14]: does include us and adult and supposed like regular people.

874
01:21:38,736 --> 01:21:39,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

875
01:21:39,076 --> 01:21:48,802
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be a good idea, Sarah, to attend the listening sessions and kind of give that feedback, because I think you speak for a lot of parents when you say that.

876
01:21:49,502 --> 01:21:59,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we're going to kind of reframe how we put everything back together when we go back in the fall, that would be a really important topic to cover as well.

877
01:22:00,362 --> 01:22:01,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Tonya.

878
01:22:01,203 --> 01:22:14,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also just want to say, Sarah, how much I appreciate you coming on to the call and speaking up because I know it's not easy, especially, you know, working, taking care of kids, you know, coming in and being here and letting people know how you feel.

879
01:22:14,911 --> 01:22:19,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really important and your voice is really valued and we need you.

880
01:22:19,254 --> 01:22:26,159
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would agree if you're able to participate in the March listening sessions, it would be really valuable to have your voice.

881
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:28,920
[SPEAKER_02]: We have asked that specifically cohort A,

882
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:38,764
[SPEAKER_02]: who can have more individualized needs, you know, has some direct listening sessions, because they will be more specific.

883
01:22:38,804 --> 01:23:00,322
[SPEAKER_02]: But I agree with you, I think that this is a broader problem, as a whole, and extends beyond just special education and into into the, you know, other otherwise, and once behavior becomes, you know, more and more problematic, it's you can, you know, friendship suffer, mental health suffers, family suffer, you know, it all sort of really goes to

884
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:01,900
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing.

885
01:23:01,940 --> 01:23:05,402
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really value and appreciate your perspective here.

886
01:23:05,862 --> 01:23:07,943
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have five more minutes, four more minutes.

887
01:23:08,023 --> 01:23:09,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Sarah.

888
01:23:10,124 --> 01:23:12,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also happy to reach out to you.

889
01:23:12,465 --> 01:23:13,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else have anything they want to add?

890
01:23:14,525 --> 01:23:23,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually just wanted to add, speaking about what Sarah had said that I think what I'm what I'm getting from what Sarah said is that

891
01:23:23,812 --> 01:23:28,454
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, as the kids get older, like Joan had said, as they get older, we want them to be more independent.

892
01:23:28,814 --> 01:23:32,756
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we kind of back off and there's a consultant piece that's added.

893
01:23:32,816 --> 01:23:51,583
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think what Sarah is saying is that in light of all the behavioral things we're going to encounter when we go back, we might want to kind of rethink the in-person services versus the consulting, especially initially, and maybe it can fade out

894
01:23:52,952 --> 01:23:53,873
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, over time.

895
01:23:55,634 --> 01:23:56,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

896
01:23:56,054 --> 01:23:57,515
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very helpful.

897
01:23:58,735 --> 01:24:04,659
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get these minutes out to for the they'll be at the next once they're approved at the next school committee meeting.

898
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:06,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, I'll send them out right after that meeting.

899
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:10,542
[SPEAKER_02]: So folks aren't waiting, you know, to the day of unfortunately, like today.

900
01:24:11,099 --> 01:24:15,881
[SPEAKER_02]: to see the things that we've discussed tonight and where we'll go in the next meeting.

901
01:24:16,382 --> 01:24:22,205
[SPEAKER_02]: The next meeting also, I know I said it a minute ago, but I'm just going to double check it again.

902
01:24:22,665 --> 01:24:28,868
[SPEAKER_02]: The next meeting for next month, just to let everybody know, is March 18th from 5 to 6.30.

903
01:24:29,268 --> 01:24:37,072
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with behavioral health first, and then special education will be from 5.45 to 6.30.

904
01:24:37,692 --> 01:24:40,694
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to thank you all for your patience today and for

905
01:24:41,413 --> 01:24:47,597
[SPEAKER_02]: your time and for speaking up and letting us know your perspective and hope you have a nice February vacation.

906
01:24:49,158 --> 01:24:53,721
[SPEAKER_02]: And look forward to seeing you all on the 22nd.

907
01:24:54,141 --> 01:24:56,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us know if you're renting out that puppy too, by the way.

908
01:24:56,683 --> 01:24:57,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

909
01:24:57,603 --> 01:24:58,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Free puppy kisses.

910
01:24:59,444 --> 01:25:03,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure anyone that follows me to the next meeting so we can all see the puppy.

911
01:25:03,467 --> 01:25:04,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

912
01:25:04,668 --> 01:25:05,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.

913
01:25:05,588 --> 01:25:07,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I can bring her to the next meeting for sure.

914
01:25:07,289 --> 01:25:07,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now.

915
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:08,590
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a little freaked out.

916
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:09,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure with my

917
01:25:10,338 --> 01:25:14,241
[SPEAKER_02]: three, two teenagers, giant dog and everything else going on here.

918
01:25:14,301 --> 01:25:16,743
[SPEAKER_02]: But she is pretty cute.

919
01:25:17,103 --> 01:25:19,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm about to get some puppy love.

920
01:25:19,485 --> 01:25:20,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you that much right now.

921
01:25:21,627 --> 01:25:22,827
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank you all again.

922
01:25:23,028 --> 01:25:25,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am looking for a motion to adjourn.

923
01:25:27,431 --> 01:25:28,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to adjourn.

924
01:25:30,413 --> 01:25:31,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I can second that.

925
01:25:32,855 --> 01:25:34,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll take a roll call on that.

926
01:25:34,776 --> 01:25:35,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Melanie McLaughlin.

927
01:25:35,757 --> 01:25:36,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mia McStone.

928
01:25:40,907 --> 01:25:41,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

929
01:25:41,807 --> 01:25:42,948
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Member Rousseau.

930
01:25:44,168 --> 01:25:44,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

931
01:25:45,089 --> 01:25:49,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Three in favor, the Special Education Behavioral Health Subcommittee meeting is adjourned.

932
01:25:49,650 --> 01:25:50,931
[SPEAKER_02]: We look forward to seeing you next month.

933
01:25:51,331 --> 01:25:52,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great vacation, everyone.

934
01:25:52,771 --> 01:25:52,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

935
01:25:52,951 --> 01:25:53,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, everyone.

936
01:25:53,972 --> 01:25:54,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye, everybody.

937
01:25:54,812 --> 01:25:55,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
