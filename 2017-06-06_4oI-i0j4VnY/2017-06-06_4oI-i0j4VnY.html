    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1269.42s">Mr.</a>  President, I would now like to make a motion to suspend the rules to take paper 17- Councilor Beall. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1273.403s">I'd</a>  like to make a, if we could suspend the rules to take 17.515 out of order. 17.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1283.559s">To</a>  the very end. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1284.879s">What's</a>  the number again? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1287.82s">17.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1288.781s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Falco for suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1291.742s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1294.843s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1298.544s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1298.624s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1300.545s">To</a>  the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1306.126s">Dear</a>  Mr. President and City Councilors, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1308.646s">I</a>  respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $49,000 for Riverbend Contamination LSP services. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1324.674s">The</a>  balance in certified cash prior to this vote is $8,239,329. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1337.252s">Alicia</a>  Hunt, Director of Energy and Environment, will be present to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1344.038s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1344.198s">Hunt,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1346.4s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you would please note Mr. Councilor Scarpelli's presence. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1353.105s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1354.666s">Alicia</a>  Hunt, Director of Energy and Environment, 41 Watson Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1363.577s">So</a>  I'm not sure how much background is helpful for the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1367.238s">I</a>  know you all received the press release that was sent out about a month ago that contamination lead was found in the soil at river bend park. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1375.96s">That</a>  part of the park has been fenced off. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1379.701s">And</a>  in order to take the fencing down, we need to do a series of testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1385.843s">Sorry,</a>  there's a weird echo on the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1389.084s">To</a>  do a series of testing, borings to <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1392.805s">understand</a>  just how deep the contamination goes, what the contamination is and the extent of it, and then we can have a solution developed depending on exactly what is there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1405.371s">So</a>  in order to get that moving, so you will see there is money actually in my budget for next fiscal year to continue with this program of moving this project forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1417.735s">However,</a>  the question that everybody wants to know is how soon can we take that fence down? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1422.877s">And</a>  in order to take it down soonest, we want to begin the work with our LSP, the testing and the reporting as soon as possible so that we can determine what the solution is and then come back and say, here's what the solution, here's what we're recommending to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1440.803s">But</a>  we basically didn't want to wait until July to get started on this, but really get started as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1448.07s">on</a>  this work.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1449.411s">Do</a>  we know how long it'll take to actually do the testing?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1454.856s">So</a>  he said it would be about, he'd be out there like two to three days with the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1460.341s">They're</a>  actually going to do borings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1461.662s">They</a>  have to go down 15 feet, but they would be small borings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1468.128s">And</a>  then it would take about on the order of two weeks to get the test results back. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1475.317s">And</a>  then there's also a series of reports that have to happen at certain prescribed times with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1479.979s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1481.7s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1481.96s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1484.16s">Councilor</a>  Nice.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1485.481s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1486.741s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1486.882s">Hunt,</a>  thank you for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1488.542s">I'm</a>  wondering if you can explain to us a little bit about what the contaminants are in the ground there and what you're aware of with the contaminants in the ground right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1495.385s">Cause</a>  apparently it sounds like you're going to have to do a little bit more research to figure out exactly what we're dealing with. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1499.626s">Number</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1500.447s">Number</a>  two, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1501.234s">I'm</a>  hoping you can also explain to the council a little bit as to whether or not this need for funding is in direct correlation to the extension of the Clippership Connector, or if this is work that would be done regardless of whether or not the Clippership Connector project was in the design stages.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1515.801s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1516.901s">So</a>  to begin with, the first question about the contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1520.804s">What</a>  we found there when we did testing was lead and a small amount of arsenic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1526.527s">So</a>  we know that that is there and we know that that is spread at the surface level throughout this area, which is why it's fenced off. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1535.993s">When</a>  we say surface level, we mean the top eight inches of the dirt. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1540.055s">So</a>  they take testing in the top eight inches and they consider that to be the surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1545.518s">There</a>  could be other contaminants there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1547.319s">We</a>  honestly don't know where it's from. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1549.767s">There</a>  are speculations around the fact that clipper ships used to be built here, and they used lead in that, in the painting of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1557.792s">But</a>  we don't actually know, and part of this is once you know that there's some contamination, in order to design an appropriate remediation plan, you have to understand the full extent, the depth, what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1570.621s">They'll</a>  do a full suite of tests for more than just lead at that location to look at the whole area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1577.903s">Your</a>  second question was about the clipper ship. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1579.825s">So</a>  none of this actually had anything to do with the clipper ship connector.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1585.751s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1585.852s">And,</a>  um, another question that I have, mr. President, this'll be it for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1588.975s">Um,</a>  in the area that we're discussing here, was any of this surface level dirt, um, or was this any of this dirt disrupted to make it surface level dirt? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1595.222s">Was</a>  there any digging excavation work or anything like that going on there that made this</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1599.318s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1599.578s">So</a>  that was contaminated product come up to surface level.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1602.06s">That</a>  was my first original gut question because we did what's called two test pits in that area where we did dig deeply and we test and we tested that soil in preparation for a different project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1613.948s">We</a>  were going to do a green infrastructure project, a project to clean stormwater that we had a grant for. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1619.612s">And</a>  so we did dig down to about seven feet and tested and that's where actually we first saw the lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1626.497s">And</a>  so when, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1627.82s">that</a>  occurred, the state said to us, you now need to test this whole area, the whole surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1633.243s">So</a>  I know that there are two areas about this big, but the practice of the way the test works when they come back and they do surface level is they did a grid of 35 test locations throughout this entire section of the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1651.713s">And</a>  they actively avoided those two spots of turned up dirt <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1656.285s">because</a>  they knew that that was dirt that had been surfaced by those test pits. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1660.968s">So</a>  this is testing from 35 locations throughout this entire section. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1666.511s">Sorry,</a>  did you have a second?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1668.552s">So</a>  is it safe to say that the state is going to be requiring us to test and remediate this situation regardless of what's going on in the area?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1678.077s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1678.337s">So</a>  that's exactly it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1679.818s">So</a>  we were, as soon as we realized that there was lead in those two test pits, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1684.567s">We</a>  said, we cannot afford, we can't do this green infrastructure here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1687.788s">It's</a>  not a good location for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1689.908s">And</a>  so we suspended that project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1693.349s">But</a>  the state, we actually had to tell them that we had found lead because of the levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1698.69s">And</a>  so they were the ones, the State Department of Environmental Protection, that said, here's where we want you to test. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1705.011s">This</a>  is the grid we want you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1707.191s">This</a>  is the area we want you to test. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1710.132s">We</a>  gave them the results from the surface level testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1713.143s">They're</a>  the ones who said you must put up a fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1715.404s">You</a>  must put up a sign that says contamination and keep out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1718.945s">You</a>  must now do this boring, this more extensive looking at the thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1727.867s">They</a>  can spread this work out over many years, but it is our desire to not have a portion of one of our public parks fenced off for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1735.889s">So</a>  we would like to move the project forward as quickly as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1740.148s">and</a>  not wait for it's the end it's part of Riverbend Park and this is this part I do I did bring picture maps in case anybody wasn't sure very helpful <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1769.555s">So</a>  when you look at this picture and this was up on the city's website, it was went out as a press release. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1776.321s">Um,</a>  you can see the river bend yacht club is at one end of the property at ship Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1782.827s">Um,</a>  and then this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1785.11s">So</a>  if you were, so for people who are not looking at this picture, I would tell you that if you were standing at the Andrews school and looking at it and decided to walk down the right side of the school towards the river, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1795.692s">So</a>  past its loading dock towards the river down that path, all of this is to the right of that asphalt path, to the right of the soccer fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1804.521s">It's</a>  got condos there with big white fences. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1809.326s">And</a>  so the white fences are essentially the property line. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1813.39s">And</a>  then this is the area between those fences and the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1817.513s">And</a>  it doesn't have any active recreation on it, like no kind of play equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1823.174s">But</a>  it is, we've been told by the condo residents that they use it for their children to play back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1829.655s">And</a>  we know, we've observed huge numbers of people cut through there on bicycles, with dogs, with strollers, off of Ship Ave and into Riverbend Park and vice versa through there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1843.098s">So</a>  you can even in that photo, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1845.51s">see</a>  like a dirt path, that's been made by people who walk through that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1850.674s">People</a>  from that neighborhood are quite upset that they're not supposed to walk through that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1856.417s">So</a>  that's part of why we'd like to move it forward quickly.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1860.48s">And</a>  if, Mr. President, I could just ask the Director of Public Health, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1863.942s">O'Connor,</a>  if she could explain some of the health risks that are associated with this type of contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1869.517s">what</a>  her position, what her office's position is relative to the remedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1871.998s">Yes,</a>  to the right, please.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1873.419s">Mary</a>  Ann O'Connor, the Director of the Board of Health for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1876.981s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1878.642s">So,</a>  so lead is naturally occurring, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1881.664s">And</a>  on most homes that were built before 1980, lead-based paint was used. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1886.626s">And</a>  lead gas was in the air until the 1980s, so there's exhaust. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1891.789s">So,</a>  you're going to find in most cities that there is lead contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1897.448s">Children</a>  under six are most susceptible, obviously, to lead poisoning, and that's because their brains and the nervous systems are still producing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1907.295s">But</a>  you can get lead poisoning through ingestion and through inhaling. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1911.718s">And</a>  again, with children, you know, the fact that they're playing outside in the dirt, then coming in and eating their lunch and not washing their hands and putting their hands in their mouth, that's where the lead becomes ingested. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1921.526s">Now,</a>  this particular situation, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1924.683s">There</a>  are certain spots that the lead is higher than others. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1928.125s">But</a>  again, there's variations that contribute to, so the seasonal variations, so when that area is covered with snow, you don't have any worries about being infected by lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1938.011s">If</a>  you have nice grass, which most of the area does have grass, that's another barrier that you don't have to worry about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1943.874s">So</a>  really what you're concerned about is bare soil and kids playing in that bare soil and then putting their hands in their mouth and ingesting the lead.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1953.375s">Mr.</a>  President, may I rest? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1955.056s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1955.656s">Appreciate</a>  your help.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1957.756s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1961.017s">Can</a>  we just get a breakdown? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1963.378s">How</a>  will the 49,000 be spent and what exactly is that going towards? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1967.96s">And</a>  what are we looking at for, I'm sure we don't know exactly, but for costs down the line?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1974.185s">So</a>  I sort of thought you were going to ask that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1977.606s">There's</a>  several different pieces of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1982.348s">Some</a>  of it actually covers some of the consulting that he's already been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1986.509s">So</a>  when you find an emergency situation like this, you, your LSP, they're a licensed site professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1993.872s">So</a>  we hire them, but they hold a license like many other professionals do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=1999.294s">So</a>  they have to like do the right thing and not what their client necessarily wants them to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2005.154s">So</a>  they come out and they start helping us with the testing, with the immediate response action. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2011.319s">We</a>  had some of the testing that has already occurred we've paid for, but then some of this consulting that's going to go into the reporting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2019.305s">They</a>  monitored us putting up the fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2022.027s">They've</a>  been having communications with DEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2025.63s">So</a>  some of that has already, some of it's happened, but there's, let me get it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2032.096s">How</a>  much did we expend so far?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2034.024s">He</a>  hasn't actually billed us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2035.424s">He's</a>  basically said, you know, I know that, you know, frankly, if he has to bill us in July for it, he will. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2042.707s">But</a>  the preference would be to really get this moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2046.348s">We</a>  don't want to delay this entire project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2049.949s">And</a>  so, sorry, I should have had it called up already. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2054.671s">Here</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2058.689s">I'm</a>  afraid to speak to the numbers off the top of my head, even though I know most of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2064.052s">There's</a>  twelve thousand dollars for the report, the immediate response outcome report that is due at the end of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2074.377s">There's</a>  four thousand dollars for the consulting that his that goes into doing that report. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2082.36s">Then</a>  there is two days of drilling assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2086.293s">all</a>  the labor, laboratory analysis, equipment, groundwater sampling, and well survey, and that's $27,000 and change. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2094.4s">There's</a>  an IRA status report that's due August 22nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2098.183s">So</a>  there's an immediate report that's due at the end of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2101.666s">There's</a>  another report that's due at the end of August that's $4,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2104.628s">So</a>  those two, the 27 and 45 are $31,586. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2106.81s">And</a>  then the other, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2115.934s">Sorry,</a>  what numbers that I don't have in front of me were his original quotes to us.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2121.436s">So</a>  the 49,000 is really just to figure out what's what we've done so far and to figure out the extent of it once we drill down to the level that we need.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2130.039s">Right,</a>  this is the characterization of the extent of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2135.041s">Once</a>  we are clear on that, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2137.27s">then</a>  we will work on developing a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2139.811s">And</a>  everybody wants to know, so what are you going to do about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2142.932s">Because</a>  that's the natural, I want to know, what are we going to do about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2146.293s">And</a>  so when I've talked to him about it, there are truly two things you can do with lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2150.955s">And</a>  that is you can remove it or you can cover it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2156.077s">If</a>  we, you know, if this was a different location and we wanted a paved basketball court, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2163.08s">We</a>  would pave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2164.0s">We</a>  would put a nice coating over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2166.008s">would</a>  be wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2166.628s">We're</a>  not doing that next to the river here, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2170.731s">Removing</a>  this amount of soil and disposing of it because it's lead-contaminated is probably going to be cost-prohibitive, although we've been talking about some ideas of mixing stuff to make that you could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2184.441s">What</a>  we'd really like to do is maybe remove some of it, put down a barrier layer, and then put clean fill on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2193.942s">And</a>  actually, we probably have clean fill up at the cemetery that we could use and would be a lovely way to dispose of the excess soil up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2204.025s">Whether</a>  that's enough or not, we don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2207.286s">But</a>  that also has complications that we would need to go to Conservation Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2213.328s">They</a>  will need to approve it because it's right next to the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2217.089s">This</a>  is probably going down to the river's edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2219.808s">And</a>  then there's people's yards, so you can't just raise the level of the dirt and have water run into their yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2224.989s">So</a>  there would need to be engineering to look at it to figure out what's the best way to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2230.811s">But</a>  that's kind of what we're hoping, that we'll take some out, we'll cover it, we'll put some clean stuff down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2236.292s">And</a>  as you asked about the clipper ship connector, this part, frankly, putting a 10 foot wide path in would be just an area where we wouldn't need as much fill or it would be easier to cover for this section here behind these condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2250.997s">But</a>  it's not part of the project.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2256.12s">It's</a>  my understanding that the design phases of the Clippership connector have not been completed yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2260.583s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2261.264s">And</a>  there's now an assumption that it's going to go back behind this residence.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2265.427s">So</a>  this is perhaps, I should be clear, not one of the areas where it's disputed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2270.23s">If</a>  you see the dirt path in the ground there, those residents in general want to know when could we pave a path <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2277.466s">Some</a>  of them have strong reservations about where the other parts of the path are going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2282.628s">They</a>  don't feel it's right to disrupt neighborhoods for their neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2287.01s">But</a>  they don't actually object to it back here for the most part. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2290.711s">There</a>  have been a few neighbors who have said they don't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2294.052s">But</a>  you can see from that dirt path that people walk through there constantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2299.854s">And</a>  I've been out there now because of the contamination and the rain. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2303.076s">And</a>  there are people walking their dogs and biking through there in the rain. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2307.025s">even</a>  on the nice, not just the nice days. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2310.686s">So</a>  that isn't, I would say it's not in design. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2314.108s">This</a>  is part of the location where the intention has always been to connect into Riverbend Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2322.13s">There</a>  is a design meeting on Thursday night at the Andrews School. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2327.072s">So</a>  people who have interest or concerns or questions about the Clippership Connector, this Thursday at seven o'clock at the Andrews School, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2335.789s">is</a>  a meeting that the DCR is organizing, I will be there and the consultants, the design consultants are going to be there.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2343.071s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2343.672s">Councilor</a>  Holyday.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2347.053s">Can</a>  you just explain the 35 test locations, was there lead found at every single one?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2354.955s">Not</a>  at every single one but at a liberal distribution of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2360.097s">So</a>  there was no ability to say, well, it's not at this end, it's not in this corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2364.996s">They</a>  were done in a grid fashion and it seemed fairly random as to where the levels were higher or lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2371.383s">There</a>  was no clear pattern to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2374.526s">Everything</a>  in that white, they were distributed throughout that white area.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2380.292s">Did</a>  we test further down?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2381.754s">We</a>  did not test on the other side of the <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2387.39s">asphalt</a>  sidewalk there, the path. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2390.332s">So</a>  outside, so I think that line should be following the asphalt path that goes down between the fields and this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2400.877s">And</a>  so the area from the asphalt path in has been part of testing that occurred when those schools were built. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2409.602s">And</a>  there was actually a response action outcome <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2414.64s">in</a>  1999 that determined it was a small amount of arsenic in that it was not of any kind of concern and it was closed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2422.843s">So</a>  because of that, DEPF did not ask us to test on the other side of that path.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2430.006s">What</a>  are the cost estimates for this large piece of property with contamination? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2435.848s">Any</a>  of the three options, I guess?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2437.928s">We</a>  have not really asked him for cost estimates yet because he keeps saying it's premature. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2442.882s">If</a>  we find something else in there, it might change the answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2448.224s">Frankly,</a>  in order to get cost estimates, you have to do a bunch of engineering and design work, and that costs money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2453.405s">So</a>  he really needs us to say, here's the plan, this is what we want to look at, and then set up a purchase order to pay him to do that kind of engineering and those sorts of estimates. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2465.949s">That's</a>  not an off-the-cuff number.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2467.765s">So</a>  we're looking at the 49,000, then cost for engineering and design, and then the fix. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2475.111s">I</a>  guess my last question then, has there been any discussion to test, I mean, obviously, if there's just a small sidewalk, you would potentially argue that there may be lead or arsenic in the lower section. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2490.924s">Are</a>  we gonna- On the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2492.385s">On</a>  the other side of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2495.07s">That's</a>  right behind the, I'm assuming, I believe this is the school right here.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2498.531s">And</a>  so those are the soccer fields, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2500.052s">That</a>  path runs down along the soccer fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2502.553s">So</a>  if you also see the soccer fields, for those of you who are familiar with them, are raised up, we understand that clean fill was brought in to that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2511.577s">And</a>  like I said, they did testing in 1999. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2514.158s">I</a>  have to tell you, my heart is always torn in a situation like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2519.02s">I</a>  do not want it to cost the city more money because that's money that can be used for other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2523.755s">But</a>  I'm the environmental director, and I want us to deal with any problems that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2529.719s">But</a>  I'm not really trying to go looking for problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2533.501s">It's</a>  a tough situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2536.023s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2537.044s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, you're probably talking to the wrong person with three young kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2540.766s">But</a>  I would just, through the chair, I mean, I would request that we do some testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2545.449s">There's</a>  soccer fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2546.41s">Kids</a>  are there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2548.291s">And</a>  it is pretty well grasped, but there</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2556.407s">back</a>  of the school where I'm not sure if they have recess that some testing and we need because we can't do all this work and then just come to find lead couple in the school and when we could have done it all so some of that so that area the other sidewalk was the limit of work for where they did testing in 1999 copies of those reports where they found a little bit of limited arsenic <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2584.258s">and</a>  nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2585.339s">And</a>  that's where they said it was not enough to be of concern to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2588.981s">And</a>  the state at that time closed it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2593.864s">Now,</a>  I wasn't here at that time, but I have copies of those reports in my office and the maps of where they did that testing.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2602.329s">And</a>  health, like Councilor Knight asked about the health concerns with arsenic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2611.374s">For</a>  children especially.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2613.016s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2613.456s">Well,</a>  again, the same concerns about ingesting and the other exposure would have to be over many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2622.043s">If</a>  you're walking on it, it would take many, many years of exposure that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2626.966s">And</a>  it would do what? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2628.327s">What</a>  would the effect be?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2635.112s">Obviously,</a>  in 1999, the state determined that the levels that were there were more like background levels and were not an amount that was going to be of risk to anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2647.06s">So</a>  they have different levels that they have concerns about, depending what the category of use is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2652.883s">So</a>  if it's a backyard, it's one level. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2654.564s">If</a>  it's a park, it's different. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2656.346s">If</a>  it's a school, if it's a parking lot, what's on top of it? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2661.689s">And</a>  so they approved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2665.275s">That's</a>  the other side of the park, the pathway for school and park use. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2674.32s">And</a>  I will say that some of the same people from the state, um, have been looking at this and helping us to do some of the research. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2681.163s">Um,</a>  I am thankful to DEP because some of what you need to do and you would hire your consultant to do is the background research on what is at this location, what's been done here in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2690.948s">And</a>  they've actually been doing a bunch of that research for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2694.323s">and</a>  feeding us the information so that we don't have to pay the consultant as much to do it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2700.205s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2702.185s">I</a>  would just request that we do some test pourings behind the Andrews Middle School as a condition of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2708.327s">I</a>  think it needs to be cleaned up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2709.548s">We</a>  have homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2710.188s">We</a>  have people living there, going to school there, teaching there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2715.329s">I</a>  believe the dog park isn't going to be too far away. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2718.83s">I</a>  think we need to just, if there's a problem behind that school where kids are playing <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2724.181s">six</a>  months out of the year, I think we need to at least, I don't know how much the test location costs, 35 test locations, but I think we need to figure it all out at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2735.466s">It's</a>  a connected, besides that small pathway, it's a connected piece of green space that I think needs to be handled all at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2744.511s">And</a>  I too, I agree with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2746.672s">Hunt,</a>  we don't want to go looking for problems, but when it comes to thousands of children playing on that field, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2754.11s">I</a>  think we need to at least investigate a bit.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2759.252s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2760.553s">If</a>  I just might, so that you're aware, increase the price related to the borings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2769.837s">I</a>  don't have an estimate on that, but it would probably have me requesting additional money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2776.8s">They</a>  had for the two days of the drilling, which is 20 soil borings in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2783.305s">and</a>  four soil borings that are groundwater monitoring wells, and then all the tests that go with that and all that work, that was $27,000.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2793.008s">But</a>  the 35 test locations, I mean, I'm saying, even if we did 10, you know, five, two rows of five along the pathway, go in 20 feet, I mean, at least we'll know, has it come past that pathway, you know?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2807.972s">Those</a>  were the 35, those were the surface testing, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2811.733s">That's</a>  what I meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2813.227s">Those</a>  order of $6,000.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2817.709s">For</a>  35.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2819.59s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2820.231s">So</a>  bring that down by a third. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2822.432s">We're</a>  talking 2 grand to maybe test 10, 7 feet.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2827.174s">I</a>  would have to confirm with them and get an actual quote, but you're right that the surface level testing is much less expensive, which is why we just did it with money that we had available.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2839.1s">And</a>  I think $2,000 is money well spent just for peace of mind and for <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2843.323s">thousands</a>  and thousands of parents that are going to have children. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2848.385s">So</a>  1999, 17 years, do the 10 tests for $2,000 and we have reassurance, but don't do it and you'll never know.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2857.39s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2858.791s">President,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2860.011s">First,</a>  I want to congratulate my colleague for expressing concern for the children back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2868.51s">And</a>  I think that we should follow, quite frankly, I believe we should follow the schema of testing and not scaling back that will allow us to get a proper sample and do proper statistical study of the land back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2884.297s">And</a>  if we're going to do it, we're going to do it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2886.718s">Mr.</a>  President, the people in this neighborhood have been under considerable duress over the whole issue of this Clippership connector, infringements on their property, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2897.815s">infringements</a>  on the security, not having an ample opportunity to discuss and explore questions and not being allowed to speak for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2907.541s">I</a>  would rather hear from them about their intentions of pathways and where they go rather than anybody else first. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2914.866s">So</a>  therefore they're now faced with additional duress in their living space because they're faced with ancient contaminants that have been there from the days of <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2924.667s">masted</a>  sailing ships that conducted crimes in our community and around the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2931.232s">This</a>  soil is clearly contaminated, the extent to which we'll learn further once we do further testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2938.497s">So</a>  to ameliorate and find a plan of action to take care of this poison in the soil and to bring the residents down there to a peace of mind, I support this paper and move approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2952.088s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2954.124s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2955.505s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2957.145s">Just</a>  a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2957.926s">Alicia,</a>  you just tell us how we notified our neighbors that what was happening and what were the, what could be the outcomes? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2966.689s">How</a>  do we do that?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2968.59s">So</a>  we put together a letter from the mayor's office explaining actually with Mary Ann's contact information, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2977.507s">Because</a>  we knew that all of their concerns would be health related concerns and I am not Appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2983.252s">I</a>  don't have the background to address the health concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2985.194s">That's</a>  Marianne's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=2986.795s">So</a>  we put together a letter It was hand delivered to everybody on ship have Every I would have to call up a map to give you the names of the streets but the two streets there that go out to Riverside have and then that side of Riverside have as well and <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3005.171s">Those</a>  letters were hand-delivered by city staff one afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3008.875s">That</a>  same afternoon, it was mailed to those addresses as well, because we don't always trust hand-delivering. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3017.323s">The</a>  mailing went to the property owners, so anything that was hand-delivered would have <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3023.126s">Picked</a>  up by whoever is residing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3025.607s">The</a>  mailing was a list from the assessor's office of the property owners in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3031.749s">And</a>  then there was, we have a lot of email addresses because of the Clippership Connector Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3038.311s">So</a>  every email address we had from that area was emailed that notice as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3043.073s">And</a>  then we sent it out to the press, put it on the city's website, and put out a Facebook about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3048.974s">so</a>  that people in general would know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3052.297s">Um,</a>  we then followed that up with fencing the area off and putting up signs that say danger, soil contamination.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3059.442s">Okay,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3060.683s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3061.944s">I</a>  second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3063.045s">Mr.</a>  President, we'll forward it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3065.447s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3067.168s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3068.449s">And,</a>  uh, it was mentioned earlier that, uh, when we built the schools, the McGlynn and the Andrew school, uh, this city hired an LSP, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3078.098s">back,</a>  I think it was in 1999 or maybe even a year prior to that, and they did extensive boring in that entire site. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3088.122s">And</a>  to be quite frank, I'm not sure if it includes this little Riverbend Park area here, but I can tell you firsthand that there was extensive boring done, and we knew back 20 years ago that there was contaminants of lead in arsenic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3104.078s">So</a>  this is no surprise, at least to me, that that area is heavily contaminated with lead and arsenic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3110.822s">And</a>  as you mentioned, soil was carted in for, uh, to mitigate rather than dig up because of the expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3118.386s">Uh,</a>  they had to put down at the top level a certain amount that allowed us to use the ballparks, as you mentioned, the soccer fields and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3126.49s">Um,</a>  and what's happening now is anytime we dig or disturb the area, all of a sudden now we're raising up red flags. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3133.377s">So</a>  whatever was being done there, you mentioned there was some digging going on for a new project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3139.719s">Maybe</a>  if there was some hindsight there saying, you know what, this is an area that we know is contaminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3144.6s">The</a>  city is high in an LSP. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3146.861s">We</a>  know it's in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3148.782s">Maybe</a>  before we dig, maybe we should do some due diligence because any digging down there is going to raise a red flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3156.784s">And</a>  I, in my opinion, we're going to be in the same predicament. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3161.366s">So</a>  my question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3164.442s">If</a>  and when this happens, first of all, how long will it take place?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3169.004s">How</a>  long will which? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3171.965s">The</a>  act of boring?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3173.866s">No,</a>  not the boring. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3174.966s">The</a>  remediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3175.967s">How</a>  long will that take place?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3177.747s">It</a>  depends how fast the city moves on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3181.649s">Honestly,</a>  you can drag this out for years if you want to under state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3187.211s">Our</a>  preference would be to do this testing now in June, have results by early July. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3192.996s">spend</a>  July and August figuring out what a good solution is, and then determine is this a solution we can put in place in the fall, what's the financial cost of it, and how long will it take? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3205.139s">We</a>  would love to take that fence down and have this fixed by the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3208.86s">I</a>  don't know if we can, but the LSP says to me that that is not an irrational hope, that as long as we keep moving on it and don't drop, you know, we theoretically could, also as long as there's no, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3222.291s">other</a>  surprises that come up, things that he wasn't anticipating. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3225.993s">There</a>  is some concern with when you're right next to the river, how do you properly do things so that you're not completely ruining the ecosystem there? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3237.177s">We</a>  have to look at flood levels and riverbanks and heights and not draining water into people's yards because we've now built up a level. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3246.521s">So</a>  there's a bunch of things that need to be taken into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3250.542s">I</a>  could imagine that we would have <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3252.513s">solutions</a>  in the fall and then spend the fall having public meetings and debate as to which solution is the best and the right one, identifying money and then not being able to implement the spring.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3264.797s">Mr.</a>  President, the reason why I asked that question, and I appreciate your response, is that for those of us that have been behind this real have dealt with the issue in the West Medford parking lot for over three and a half years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3276.761s">And</a>  we're finally getting to a point where we're going to remediate the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3280.742s">and</a>  a great disruption to the businesses in West Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3283.463s">But</a>  the reason why I ask is because, as you mentioned, this is a highly traversed area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3289.546s">And</a>  I would hate to see this go on any longer than it has to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3293.608s">And</a>  I, as one member, will approve this, but I'd like to see a time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3298.91s">I</a>  have to see something in writing that's going to say, we're going to start on this date. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3304.232s">By</a>  then, the boring will be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3305.853s">We're</a>  going to start August 1st with the choosing of a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3310.581s">or</a>  sending out a request for proposal for work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3313.122s">I</a>  think we have to see a timeframe before we vote on anything because potentially we could be looking at another West Medford Bargainspot liquor issue that lingers on for three, four, five years in this community, an area that's fenced off saying contaminants. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3328.248s">And</a>  as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned about the neighbors and so forth, about notification, I think it's important that residents not only know what's going on there, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3338.736s">but</a>  also have an idea of a timeframe. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3341.157s">So</a>  I'm not prepared to vote on this unless you're prepared tonight to at least give us some timeframe of the boring. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3348.922s">What</a>  is the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3349.802s">I</a>  don't have any paperwork in front of me.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3351.803s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3352.043s">So</a>  that's what I asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3353.084s">Um,</a>  I've been sort of asking what are the different, where are the bottlenecks? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3357.306s">Um,</a>  so my first thing is that I would need a purchase order in order for the, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3363.225s">consultant</a>  to start doing drillings consulting giving me advice. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3366.948s">He's</a>  willing to just do knowing that we'll make him whole eventually So I asked finance they said if it was approved tonight They could have something cut for me by Friday, which would mean that he could mobilize it during the last two weeks of June He has to schedule it but it will either be next week or the week after that that he could have borings done We have a report that's due June 20th 23rd <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3391.952s">That's</a>  when we have an IRA plan due to DEP that the consultant will work on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3396.913s">It's</a>  my expectation that if we move at this rate where we are out there in the next two weeks, we will have the results before the 1st of July, and that's when we'll start the planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3411.157s">How</a>  long that planning takes will be dependent on what the results of these tests are. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3416.719s">Depending</a>  what the tests are will dramatically change that piece of it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3422.243s">So,</a>  so for this first part, I would ask my council colleagues, uh, to put a condition that, uh, the boring and test results be received by this council by July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3432.745s">That's</a>  a date that you just said that seems realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3436.366s">Um,</a>  and that way we know the process is going to keep moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3438.846s">So</a>  I would ask that as a condition, uh, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3444.087s">And</a>  also, uh, my last point is, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3448.356s">Recently,</a>  the community voted by way of election that we created a Community Preservation Act, and that's for open space, community preservation, and a number of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3462.102s">Could</a>  that money be used to work on a project like this?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3467.344s">I</a>  would want to check, but I don't think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3471.226s">I</a>  can't say definitively not, but it's used for improving recreation areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3476.833s">And</a>  it's used for acquiring land. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3481.236s">And</a>  I've never asked, because before now, before this occurred, the brownfield that we had concern about was a West Bedford parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3491.922s">And</a>  I would tell you, no, you can't use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3493.443s">That's</a>  a parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3494.424s">It's</a>  not a recreation area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3496.105s">So</a>  I will say that I have not actually thought to ask whether we would be able to use that money <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3502.476s">on</a>  something like this?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3504.857s">You</a>  can ask, but Mr. President, if we could make that part of also the condition that we receive a report back or response from the city solicitor asking us, asking whether or not we can use Community Preservation Act to pay for this ongoing process of remediation on this particular site. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3525.221s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3529.061s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3530.242s">I</a>  just had a couple of last questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3532.403s">Alicia,</a>  is all of this property, is this all City of Medford property? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3536.025s">Is</a>  any of this property owned by DCR?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3539.187s">Well,</a>  I was actually... So, in fact, when we started this project, we were under the impression it was all City of Medford, and it turns out that there is an amount near the Yacht Club, so we thought the border was the line between the gravel and the grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3557.543s">I've</a>  actually now had it flagged where the property line is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3560.665s">So</a>  I had a surveyor out there this week, last week, last week to mark where the property line is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3567.47s">So</a>  it's about 100 feet in from the Riverside Yacht Club into the park where the DEP property is. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3575.256s">So</a>  we've been in DEP, sorry, DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3578.619s">So</a>  we have been talking with DCR about their property ownership of that 100 feet there and how they wanna handle that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3587.719s">We</a>  will not be doing any of our borings past that property line. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3592.961s">That's</a>  why we had it marked. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3595.302s">And</a>  we're trying to coordinate with DCR that last 100 feet.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3598.443s">So</a>  DCR will hopefully eventually do borings in that area?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3602.545s">I'm</a>  certain that the state DEP will require them to, just like they're requiring us to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3607.147s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3609.175s">As</a>  far as, you mentioned there are two reports, one in June and one in August?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3613.317s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3614.138s">Can</a>  we receive copies of both of those when they are?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3616.199s">I'm</a>  happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3619.241s">For</a>  the record, they are public reports, so we will submit them to state DEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3624.143s">DEP</a>  reviews them, and then they put them on their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3626.764s">They're</a>  available for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3628.886s">The</a>  city is also perfectly welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3631.247s">We</a>  can send it to you guys and post them on the city's website as well.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3634.028s">If</a>  you could send us copies, I'd greatly appreciate it, and just be good to <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3637.706s">read</a>  those as soon as we get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3639.007s">There's</a>  a lot of residents that live in that area, so it would be ideal to see what exactly, we know what the concerns are, but to see how bad it is and what's eventually going to be done.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3649.155s">And</a>  I do just want to warn you, I don't write those reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3652.117s">The</a>  licensee professional does. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3654.478s">When</a>  I've read others of these reports, they're kind of heavy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3657.681s">They're</a>  kind of heavy in the technical terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3662.449s">They're</a>  not written for the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3664.19s">They're</a>  written for the state agency that monitors this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3669.094s">So,</a>  but yeah, we're happy to share them.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3671.436s">Just</a>  following on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3672.957s">So</a>  when we had the committee, the whole meeting regarding the Clippership Connector a couple of months ago, I believe they talked about the other side of the river as well.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3683.045s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3683.785s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3684.026s">93</a>  side of the river.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3685.106s">Is</a>  that DCR property?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3686.467s">That</a>  is DCR property over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3688.749s">The</a>  whole other side of the river between 93 and the river.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3692.757s">Do</a>  we know if there are any plans for the DCR to test that side?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3695.859s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3697.3s">Usually</a>  people don't start testing soil until you're going to remove it and move it out of the way, and that's what triggers somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3705.524s">So</a>  when you move soil and you're getting rid of it, you can't just move it unless you know that it's clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3712.328s">So</a>  if you're going to dispose of it somewhere, you have to test it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3715.81s">You</a>  have to do a characterization. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3718.412s">So</a>  usually you don't unless you have a reason to test it.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3721.309s">The</a>  reason why I ask is because that night I think they did talk about putting a lane of, you know, a trail that went on that side of the river as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3729.931s">I'm</a>  not sure if that's going to come before or after the Clippership Connector, but I would think that would be a concern as well that needs to be addressed.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3737.833s">And</a>  I would have to refer that to DCR and what they would choose to do on their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3744.534s">The</a>  agency that would oversee that contamination, et cetera, is the State Department of Environmental <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3752.168s">And</a>  while I'm the environmental director in Medford, I don't actually have oversight over that, and I can't tell the state agency to go test. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3760.071s">It</a>  would be the other state agency that would tell them.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3762.312s">And</a>  I understand that, but I think if they're going to run, because they made it sound like that during the meeting, they were going to run that path down that side.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3770.395s">They</a>  would also like to investigate that path. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3772.956s">They</a>  would also like to consider designing on that side as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3777.253s">that</a>  is not currently funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3778.873s">It's</a>  not currently a project in process.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3785.054s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3785.474s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3787.075s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3788.235s">One</a>  last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3789.075s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3791.396s">With</a>  regards to the many, many condos that are on the other side of this white line, I see that a lot of it's paved and obviously built on, but has there been any concerns from the property owners that this led <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3806.18s">on</a>  their property and underneath their property?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3808.301s">This</a>  state has been in touch with them and has been talking to them directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3812.785s">I</a>  have not been a party to those conversations, but I was told they were contacting the Condo Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3819.989s">They</a>  have actually groundwater contamination under those condos that they have been dealing with, and they have a licensed site professional engaged because of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3831.702s">So</a>  I know that the state told, well, the state told me that they were going to speak to the Condo Owners Association and to that LSP about the lead, but I don't know what he actually said or what their plans are.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3847.273s">So</a>  the groundwater contamination that they have is mostly likely lead?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3850.815s">It's</a>  completely unrelated. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3852.296s">Oh,</a>  completely unrelated. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3854.338s">It</a>  is completely unrelated. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3856.819s">I</a>  think it's hydrocorps. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3857.9s">Do</a>  you remember? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3859.724s">It's,</a>  yeah, it's a completely different contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3861.965s">And</a>  we were, frankly, we were shocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3864.126s">We</a>  thought that when we dug right next, the first test pit, that we were going to see their contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3870.71s">If</a>  anything, we didn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3872.731s">We</a>  saw this other thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3873.711s">Completely</a>  different. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3874.672s">And</a>  that was because all of the test borings that were done in 1999 and before then, or through that project, were on the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3882.636s">I</a>  have all of those reports in my office, and there was nothing done on this side of the pathway. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3888.496s">And</a>  honestly, I know people keep telling me that we know there was lead there, but the actual report sitting in my desk doesn't say that there was lead there on the rest of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3901.44s">So</a>  it's perplexing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3903.78s">This</a>  is not the first time I've had people say that by far.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3907.961s">I</a>  move approval of the paper as well or second it with those two or three conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3915.323s">And</a>  make sure we have a report back from the mayor's office stating that she's going to give the extra $2,000 to do 10 additional test porings, seven feet deep. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3924.746s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3926.447s">Councilor</a>  Neistat. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3927.707s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3928.868s">I,</a>  too, feel as though this is an appropriate paper to approve this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3932.929s">I</a>  feel as though it's a good use of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3935.39s">Ultimately,</a>  it's an unforeseen situation that does require immediate action. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3939.611s">I</a>  think that the residents of the neighbourhood deserve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3942.338s">We</a>  have a reoccurring theme in our community here that the residents want to see us tap into one of the most underutilized resources that we have here in Medford, which is our river. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3951.023s">That,</a>  coupled with the fact that the residents along Ship Avenue that are abutting this property are going to see a drastic impact on their quality of life and their property value, the longer that this fence stays up that says contamination would lead me to believe that it's a good vote this evening to take to approve the $49,000 for riverbed contamination LSP services, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3969.769s">As</a>  such, I would support the amendments as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3971.67s">Move</a>  approval of the question.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3973.151s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3975.112s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3975.492s">We</a>  have a gentleman that would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3980.695s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3983.856s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushing Street Method Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=3987.438s">I'm</a>  very dismayed all of a sudden we may have a dirty 21E at this riverside after 200 to 300 years of the area being a dumping site. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4000.407s">And</a>  if there is a problem, although is this not the DCR State of Massachusetts problem and their cost to clean up? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4012.173s">Believe</a>  in that in the 1677 law, Massachusetts had said, we the people have rights of 20 feet above mean high tide along all waterways. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4026.932s">P.S.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4028.013s">I,</a>  we have been fishing and my son and many of my neighbors and biking there for over 50 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4035.74s">I'm</a>  further dismayed being on the eve of finally getting our East Medford connect the bike path, the missing link, which happens to be the center of the city, mind you, connecting West to assembly road. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4055.952s">Also,</a>  we had already built bike paths behind adjacent and adjoining that possible dirty 21E area behind the new schools, the McGlynn and the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4073.604s">And</a>  it's sad, coincidentally, when we're finally having a Thursday meeting to hopefully finalize and connect the middle path. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4083.43s">that</a>  we have this situation that I've noticed the fences and I couldn't negotiate with my bicycle for the last couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4093.116s">Please,</a>  let's try to make some sense of this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4095.777s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4096.478s">And</a>  hopefully this year and not in 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4101.041s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4105.423s">Hi,</a>  Gina's 35 Paris street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4107.144s">If</a>  I may, through the chair, just a question on clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4109.706s">Uh,</a>  when, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4112.093s">Alicia</a>  was going over the details of the boardings that were going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4115.716s">I</a>  believe she indicated there were four that were going to go down to groundwater level, and I'm just curious if we're testing that groundwater at the same time, and if so, what type of additional implications could that open up for that same area?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4130.886s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4135.032s">So</a>  basically there are different kinds of contamination. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4138.254s">Some</a>  are soil contaminations and some are groundwater contaminations.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4162.058s">And</a>  so we need to test the groundwater because we need to test for everything per the state DEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4169.405s">And</a>  so if you find contamination in groundwater, then the question is, what is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4174.49s">How</a>  is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4174.97s">Is</a>  it coming out? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4175.711s">Is</a>  it getting out into the air? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4177.313s">How</a>  is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4177.873s">Like,</a>  that's one of those things that could change. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4181.457s">You</a>  know, when I say, oh, we could dig up the soil and put new soil on top, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4185.273s">But</a>  then if we find groundwater contamination, that could change totally what we're doing and totally what the solution is, which is why I hesitate to say this is what our solution is and this is how long we're going to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4197.78s">My</a>  hope is that we don't find anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4199.781s">If</a>  we find stuff in the groundwater that's related to what's actually being treated for under those condos, then that would be connected. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4207.745s">And</a>  that's actually being paid for by an insurance company. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4211.652s">from</a>  the person, the company that insured the construction of those condos originally is paying for that current work that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4220.435s">So</a>  if we found the same contaminant, it would be linked and become part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4224.277s">It</a>  could get complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4225.857s">I'm</a>  hoping that it doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4227.658s">We</a>  can all do what we do to hope that we don't find contamination and that this is just the lead is the only thing there.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4883.643s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4885.124s">And</a>  I'd like to thank councilor Caraviello for putting this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4888.465s">Um,</a>  I too, over the weekend had the opportunity to meet with a couple of business owners that, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4893.02s">operate</a>  on Harvard Avenue, and there's a situation where it's not just one development that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4899.886s">We</a>  have the development at 640 Boston Avenue being performed by 640 Boston Avenue LLC, and that's a 43-unit development housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4908.474s">And</a>  I spoke with the general manager of the construction company yesterday, and that project is going to be wrapping up around July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4915.66s">So</a>  the construction is going to be complete, and people will be moving in July 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4919.137s">With</a>  that being said, Mr. President, that's not the only issue in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4921.858s">We've</a>  seen the MBTA perform an extended amount of work on the train tracks in preparation for the Greenland extension that's impacted this business. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4930.621s">Now</a>  we've seen Tufts University go in and do some work up on the top of Boston Ave that's also impacted this business. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4937.004s">And</a>  now we're seeing RX Devereux doing some public utility work on the Somerville side that's disrupting this business. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4944.006s">So</a>  if you wanted to get to <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4946.681s">the</a>  stretch of Boston Avenue between Ball Square and Harvard Street, and you were coming from Somerville, the only way that you'd be able to go would be to go up past Tufts University, all the way up to the library, then turn around down Boston Avenue and come back down Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4960.825s">So</a>  in essence, the traffic constraints that are in place right now are detouring people directly out of the entire region, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4967.508s">We're</a>  just having an impact on the businesses down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4970.308s">So</a>  I think it's also pertinent that we receive copies of the traffic management plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4975.867s">from</a>  640 Boston Avenue, as well as Irak Stavro, who's performing the utility work on Harvard Street on the Somerville side, Mr. President, in front of St. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4984.55s">Clement's</a>  Church. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4985.79s">It's</a>  my understanding that Tufts University, at this point in time, has ceased their construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4989.471s">That</a>  project is complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4990.912s">And</a>  the finishing touches that are being put on are striping and signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=4994.953s">And</a>  I also am under the impression, Mr. President, that in the near future, the MBTA will be back out in the area performing some work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5002.275s">They're</a>  going to be doing some land takings, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5004.392s">So</a>  I'd also like to ask that the MBTA provide us with their traffic management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5008.533s">Once</a>  we receive those documents, we can forward them to our division of engineering and ask our division of engineering to review the traffic management plans and come up with recommendations to create a better flow of traffic that will have a less adverse impact on the businesses that are in operation on that stretch of land.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5024.298s">Thank</a>  you, councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5024.998s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5026.779s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice president. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5028.799s">I</a>  too went out in the site, talked to a few of the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5032.48s">I</a>  think if we can have, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5035.112s">from</a>  beginning to end of Boston Ave that constituents get an update on when the jobs or work being performed is being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5044.176s">I</a>  had a call and I talked to one of our friends that told us that they have to get up and leave an hour and a half early before the construction starts because <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5058.237s">the,</a>  if the construction starts walk before they leave, depending what time they come in, they're stuck in the driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5065.36s">So,</a>  and they're not getting much help or assistance or information from, uh, those, those developers or, um, the contractor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5075.164s">So</a>  if we can reach out to, um, uh, uh, engineering and see who's doing the work to inform our, uh, constituents on Devereux and Boston Ave all the way up and down, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5088.625s">make</a>  and have a defined start time and end time to make their lives a little bit easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5096.992s">It'd</a>  be greatly appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5098.233s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5099.134s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5099.474s">Councilor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5100.015s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5101.616s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5102.977s">I</a>  attended last Wednesday night instead of our committee of the whole meeting, I attended a meeting sponsored by the department of transportation on the green line extension and there was there along with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5117.197s">and</a>  members of our state delegation to express concern by a number of the neighbours and butters to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5127.002s">One</a>  of the clear things that's emerged in this latest development of activity along the rail line or the rail corridor is the fact that much of the work proceeded without a point person, a point of contact for the neighbours. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5145.478s">someone</a>  who would represent the construction company, the MBTA, the Department of Transportation, to the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5154.063s">We</a>  expressed that clearly to the members of the construction team that were present there, the management team from the MBTA, DOT, and the construction people. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5165.629s">And</a>  so they got the message clear, not only from the elected officials present, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5172.39s">but</a>  also from the neighbours, that they want someone that they can reach out and have open channels of communication where there are problems occurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5180.235s">And</a>  they are occurring, and there's going to be a significant change, ambient change, to the area as this project continues. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5189.76s">There'll</a>  be elimination of virtually all the vegetation all the way up beyond the gymnasium at the corner of College Avenue to accommodate this project in the coming months. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5202.73s">They'll</a>  begin the process of widening the rail bed or moving the tracks further to the north to make way for the southern tracks that will be inserted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5217.217s">And</a>  we're going to see the insertion of retaining walls and the beginnings and foundations of sound barriers in the corridor. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5226.381s">So</a>  they're ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5228.142s">They're</a>  going. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5228.982s">They're</a>  moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5229.542s">They're</a>  doing the prep work. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5232.047s">We</a>  can, uh, unless something happens with the funding at this point, uh, we can consider it underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5238.972s">And,</a>  uh, so, uh, people are going to be affected, uh, and people will need someone to reach out to who was managing the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5248.359s">And,</a>  um, uh, we made that our priority in that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5252.463s">Uh,</a>  there will be another meeting, I think in a week or so, I forget the exact date, um, here in the council chambers, uh, for the general public of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5261.493s">to</a>  speak on the issue of this green line extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5264.655s">I</a>  know they're holding one I think this week or next week in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5271.299s">So</a>  it will be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5272.88s">Everything</a>  is up on the city's web page and the green line extension web page as far as information and contacts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5280.644s">But</a>  I know that a number of people have felt the pressure by being constantly under construction up there for the past several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5290.462s">a</a>  lot of utility work, and there has been disruption up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5296.884s">We</a>  want to support the businesses up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5299.966s">We</a>  want to support you and see that you're served properly up there and don't have to go under any more duress than is necessary.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5312.05s">Council</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5313.291s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5313.931s">I</a>  know Councilman Layton mentioned that the project that's up there will be finished in July, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5319.712s">when</a>  I spoke to him saying, oh, he's telling me that another project is ready to go right behind it, and the developer of that property has made no attempt to work with the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5331.236s">Again,</a>  total disregard for their needs before he started. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5335.538s">So</a>  before this, say, as soon as one stops, no one's gonna start, and these guys, and same person, and these people, it'll be another two years before they get a break. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5347.041s">I</a>  think something has to be done now, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5349.455s">when</a>  this guy just decides to do whatever he wants.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5351.977s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5353.038s">Name</a>  and address of the record, sir.</p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5354.74s">It's</a>  Joseph Anoletto, 590 Boston Ave, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5360.404s">Thank</a>  you primarily first for giving me this opportunity to speak about my grievances tonight in front of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5370.493s">Basically</a>  I've been grinning, bearing, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5373.71s">the</a>  impacts from the construction since the first phase of the Green Line, and I think it started in about October 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5385.019s">Surprisingly,</a>  the impacts from that construction, in particular to the Harvard Street Bridge, was not as significant as I thought in the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5398.05s">Because</a>  whoever was the engineer on that project <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5403.495s">particularly</a>  routing the traffic, they were cognizant of our ongoing day-to-day business. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5410.84s">And</a>  sales actually were pretty close to the sales before the work commenced. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5418.645s">This</a>  situation, it's completely different. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5421.767s">I</a>  mean, I've never been in comfort by road construction this badly in my entire life there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5428.392s">And</a>  I've been working on that corner since 1990. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5432.201s">And</a>  I've probably been working on that corner every day, you know, seven days a week since 1998. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5441.324s">So,</a>  I mean, I spend a significant amount of time in the neighborhood, and I know, you know, I have a feel for the flow of traffic and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5449.747s">And</a>  it just seems like no one knows what's going on over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5453.608s">I</a>  mean, customers are complaining about it to me every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5459.667s">You</a>  know, I had a hard time getting over here, and I came here after work instead of coming here in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5464.97s">Some</a>  of them, you know, they're fed up with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5471.354s">You</a>  know, to what extent do myself have to be responsible for loss of business for all this other work being done around me? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5483.16s">I</a>  mean, there was no, nobody really reached out to me before the utility work began. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5489.323s">development</a>  project on Saturday and it just seems like the work started and I'm supposed to grin and bear the sentiment that I'm picking up off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5498.608s">Um,</a>  I mean, I realized that the entire area is going to change, you know, gentrification has taken place and you know, we all know that, but, uh, it's really starting to affect my bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5510.654s">And,</a>  uh, it's the losses and particularly, uh, the last couple of months since Easter, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5518.955s">have</a>  been significant to the point where I feel demoralized. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5524.936s">You</a>  sit there when the top of Boston Ave is closed, and then Harvard Street, and then Warner Street's closed, and you're just sitting there twiddling your thumbs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5535.739s">So</a>  then the thing that really set me off is reading the scope of the work that Devereux Construction had outlined. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5545.121s">They're</a>  going to be doing utility work Monday through Saturday in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5549.171s">And</a>  I mean, the cow wash business, May is probably our busiest month of the year, and we really do rely on that revenue to get through the rest of the year, obviously because of the pollen season. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5559.237s">And</a>  I can understand Monday through Friday from 7 to 4, but Monday through Saturday? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5566.522s">Is</a>  it that necessary to do work on Saturday? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5571.565s">Also,</a>  the way they've been running the traffic over there, it seems like they do it a different way every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5577.633s">I</a>  mean, it's a, for lack of a better word, a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5586.916s">I</a>  just feel that the planning of this work was not well thought out from an inexperienced person. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5596.559s">I've</a>  never been a traffic engineer in my life, and I probably never will. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5600.46s">But</a>  I just feel like something's wrong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5602.681s">And</a>  I'm not the only one that said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5606.334s">Countless</a>  people have said, you know, you should be, you know, getting an attorney and all this other, you know, I'm trying to run a business on a day-to-day basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5615.258s">I</a>  really don't want to go, you know, to those means because it's just going to suck up my time and compromise, you know, the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5628.263s">I</a>  have to be there making sure I'm making improvements, making sure my customers are being paid, and a plethora of other, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5636.617s">issues</a>  that go with running a business of that nature, a service business. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5641.56s">So,</a>  again, basically the premise of my grievance was outlined by Rick and Adam, you know, before I spoke. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5650.725s">And,</a>  you know, I'd really appreciate any type of consideration that you as the council can give to us, not just myself, but the entire neighborhood over there as the rest of this work goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5664.832s">I</a>  would like to say, though, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5667.968s">When</a>  they did do the first phase of work on the bridge, whoever was in charge of engineering the traffic flow did a significantly better job than it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5681.933s">Whoever</a>  is working, whoever is in charge of that dynamic is not doing a good job, in my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5695.797s">Thank</a>  you for your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5698.538s">Mr.</a>  Enoletto, have you had any conversations with Tufts University or the city of Medford relative to the work that they're going to be proposing relative to the complete streets program in the reconfiguration of the intersection at Boston Avenue and at the top of the hill by the library? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5713.707s">No,</a>  I've had no correspondence with Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5715.307s">No</a>  correspondence with Tufts and nobody from the administration as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5718.109s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5719.25s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5719.59s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could amend the paper to request that the city engineer reach out to Titan gas station to explain to him the scope and circumstances of the <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5727.665s">complete</a>  streets project going on at the top of Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5730.287s">That</a>  would be appreciated as well.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5738.791s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5741.733s">I</a>  feel like every meeting that I attend and I watch, we hear more and more about the onslaught that our residents and small business are facing in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5753.74s">And</a>  I think it's becoming crucial <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5757.399s">that</a>  we demand that these folks that are working within our city limits reach out and communicate effectively with the people whose lives they're impacting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5771.749s">And</a>  in an area like Boston Ave, that isn't necessarily just the butters or people in the general neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5779.375s">That's</a>  a main area that people traverse through. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5782.517s">There</a>  should be communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5784.238s">There</a>  should be transparencies for these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5787.712s">And</a>  there should be representation of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5791.434s">We</a>  really are, for lack of a better phrase, under attack. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5797.157s">Everyone</a>  is feeling it across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5799.379s">They're</a>  feeling it on Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5801.38s">They're</a>  feeling it up on Winthrop Street by the high school where there's demolition going on up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5807.683s">Salem</a>  Street is getting set to feel its pains with the Break Probe Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5813.827s">I</a>  don't know if that statement has come out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5816.354s">But</a>  we expect that to be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5819.256s">And</a>  yet we continue to see the south street area there under attack too by their onslaught of development that's happening there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5829.244s">But</a>  we continue to see these groups, teams and individuals come into our city and run roughshod over everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5838.892s">And</a>  yes, gentrification is underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5841.354s">But</a>  we certainly don't have to sit back and just accept it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5844.417s">And</a>  gentrification isn't only <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5846.479s">going</a>  to occur to just our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5850.54s">It's</a>  going to occur to our businesses as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5853.201s">And</a>  so we talk about things like how to revitalize Medford Square and bring back small businesses where you hear about, you know, organizations and companies that are suffering because their foot traffic and vehicle traffic is being removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5869.206s">We</a>  look at someone like Carol's who's been under onslaught now for months upon months with bridge <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5875.636s">that's</a>  going to extend and extend and extend. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5879.198s">And</a>  it troubles me greatly because we keep discussing these things, and the situation seemingly is getting worse and worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5889.803s">We</a>  talk about things like development committees made up of residents, and I think we talked about that weeks ago now, haven't heard a word back about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5899.809s">So,</a>  you know, I've said it before, I'll say it again, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5905.507s">zoning,</a>  development, yes, there are departments that are involved, but the purview of it resides with this Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5915.355s">And</a>  I would urge you, if we don't do something as a group to set limits and insist upon the rules of engagement for these folks, it's going to come to a head somehow. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5933.712s">That</a>  in conjunction with the airplanes and everything, it's just, it's crazy right now in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5938.835s">And</a>  we look to you guys because we know how much you all love the city like we do, but it's, next week it's going to be someone else coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5948.119s">You</a>  know, there's always something going on and until, unless and until we insist that they have those communication plans and <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5960.93s">use</a>  the proper methods to communicate them effectively throughout the city when appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5966.794s">It's</a>  just going to continue to go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5968.955s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5969.876s">Thank</a>  you for your comments on the motion by council president Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5973.458s">Second</a>  council Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5984.185s">Turn</a>  on the mic.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5992.698s">Did</a>  you have the, uh, I'm looking for the, cause this is a petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=5996.58s">So</a>  I'm trying to kind of, uh, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6001.762s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6003.043s">So</a>  the resolve is, uh, uh, Medford city council discuss the problems caused by construction of Boston Avenue to Harvard street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6011.247s">And</a>  then we have amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6018.13s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6018.391s">The</a>  city engineer, uh, reach out to the, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6022.008s">uh,</a>  business owners of Titan to, uh, to further explain the scope of the service and construction and the ongoing process, uh, to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6030.832s">Um,</a>  let's see.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6036.395s">Is</a>  that a Council of Knights amendment?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6039.056s">This</a>  is the Council of Knights amendment.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6040.737s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6041.957s">Now</a>  let me see, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6044.975s">Scarpelli</a>  is looking for the City Engineer to provide a start time and end time of the projects to reach out and provide some notifications to the residents or businesses in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6059.187s">Let</a>  me see here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6060.428s">And</a>  President Calvillo, City Engineer, give some time, let's see here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6073.118s">scope</a>  of time, you know, when, when the projects, these projects are going to continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6076.5s">So</a>  they were also looking for a start and end time.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6079.822s">Um,</a>  if then nothing's been mentioned with regards to traffic flow and who's in charge of traffic flow.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6085.485s">So</a>  if we could. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6086.725s">The</a>  Councilor Knight asked for, uh, uh, traffic plans from the, uh, uh, MBTA, uh, and, uh, and the, uh, traffic plans for the, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6100.033s">construction</a>  at Harvard and Boston Avenue and surrounding areas.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6106.659s">I</a>  just think that's the main point of the, one of the main points of the complainant, that we look into the traffic flow and make sure it's flowing the same every day and in a way that works. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6121.293s">So</a>  I second approval of the paper and hopefully the administration can <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6126.591s">get</a>  on the MBTA as well, if we could ask the administration to also reach out to the MBTA and ask them to make sure traffic's flowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6134.874s">We</a>  need to keep on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6136.155s">As</a>  a city, we need to make sure that traffic is flowing for our residents and the business owners, and that it's consistent day after day. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6143.178s">Because</a>  as a business owner, you feel the frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6146.119s">You</a>  don't want anybody to be hurting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6147.86s">And</a>  if it comes down to it, construction's going to go on everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6151.401s">But</a>  if it comes down to actually just managing your traffic flow, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6156.04s">on</a>  a consistent basis so the residents and the people that frequent these businesses know how to get point A to point B the same way every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6165.704s">That's</a>  a simple fix that should be done and should be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6169.145s">So</a>  I ask that the mayor's office get on this and I second the resolve, especially asking the MBTA to figure it out for our residents and our business owners.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6395.887s">And</a>  how many employees do you have working for you?</p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6398.109s">I</a>  have four.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6399.73s">Four</a>  employees working for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6401.079s">Mr.</a>  President, as I review the paperwork here, I see the statement of workers' compensation insurance affidavit for a gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6407.603s">In</a>  box number two on the state form, which I have a little bit of familiarity of, it says, I am a sole proprietor of a partnership and have no employees working for me in any capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6415.427s">If,</a>  in fact, the gentleman does have four employees working for him, he will be required to purchase workers' compensation insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6421.39s">In</a>  terms of the materials that have been submitted to the council this evening, they are complete in terms of the accuracy as to whether or not he's not going to be required to carry workers' compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6430.391s">different</a>  story Mr. if in fact he does have four employees that are working for him that are not part of the sole proprietorship of the business partnership then he will be required to purchase workers compensation insurance purchase the workers compensation insurance does of hundred if you are found in violation of the workers compensation act and fail to appeal it $250 a day if you found in violation of the workers compensation act and do appeal it so I guess my question to the gentleman at the podium right now is if in fact you do have a <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6460.287s">that</a>  are working for you and you are currently in operation, you will be found in violation of the law if these people aren't at least 25 years of your corporation.</p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6471.032s">Yeah,</a>  I explained to Sylvia in the clerk department. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6475.835s">As</a>  my wife and me have kids working, I need to know how many hours I have those employees because I don't know if I can hire them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6487.884s">But</a>  if I extend my hours, I'm going to hire them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6491.467s">Not</a>  yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6491.887s">I</a>  don't have it yet.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6493.128s">So</a>  right now, you're open from 11?</p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6495.65s">It's</a>  just my wife and me. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6497.752s">We</a>  are in the checkbooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6499.773s">And</a>  my son just give us help. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6501.495s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6501.755s">So</a>  the articles of incorporation that were filed at the Secretary of State's office would list the offices and principles of the corporation and yourself and your wife?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6510.142s">And</a>  then if the Department of Industrial Accidents Investigation Division happened to go to 213 Middlesex Avenue, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6517.532s">and</a>  went behind the counter, the only people that would be working, including delivering, cooking food, working cash register, any of that?</p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6524.017s">Well,</a>  it's a small business. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6525.078s">We</a>  just started, but we want to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6527.2s">So</a>  that's why we want to spend hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6529.502s">If</a>  we spend hours, I don't choose going to hire probably two more employees, but I'm going to hire maybe a driver, an extra driver.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6539.89s">So</a>  as long as you're aware that if, in fact, you do hire employees that are in excess of your ground.</p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6544.293s">Oh,</a>  definitely.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6545.414s">Of</a>  the individuals in your group. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6547.139s">Mr.</a>  President, based upon the conversation I've had with the gentleman, I do feel as though the paper is in order and complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6553.704s">I</a>  would suggest that because of the nature of the permit and the willingness for the employee to keep his business open until 2 o'clock in the morning, we place a 90-day review on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6562.971s">I</a>  would also recommend, Mr. President, that if approved, that the approval for extended hours would stay with the business and not the address. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6569.496s">So</a>  that if the business moves, then the permit for extended hours would die with the relocation of the business.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6580.084s">If</a>  I could, through the chair, Mr. President, ask why do you wish to stay open so late?</p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6587.092s">Like</a>  I said, we want to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6588.453s">We</a>  want to, you know, especially people who are awake late, not us, we are sleeping early, but I know the market. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6599.384s">I</a>  have a friend of mine who has a pizzeria in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6603.475s">And</a>  they catch most of the business right now after those hours because everybody else closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6609.559s">And</a>  then I request to some of my neighbors and my customers if they say it could be also because it's anything open at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6618.244s">Sometimes</a>  we are late of the jobs and it's nothing open. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6622.827s">It</a>  could be really good for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6624.108s">Why</a>  you don't try? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6624.788s">That's</a>  what I'm trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6625.909s">I</a>  mean, I'm just trying to see if I can grow, you know.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6631.756s">And</a>  if I could, do you offer a delivery service? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6635.377s">Do</a>  you have deliveries of pizza? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6637.298s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6637.518s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6638.759s">It</a>  must be most of the business that probably deliver. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6641.86s">That's</a>  what I say. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6642.7s">If</a>  I, if I extend the hours, if I can give me that opportunity, I can, you know, hire more people and more drivers because I can do it myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6652.564s">Definitely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6653.545s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6654.505s">Mr.</a>  President, if I might say, uh, in the past, when faced with these requests, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6660.873s">When</a>  there's been opposition, those people have made themselves known either by informing myself and other councillors or by making themselves present here at a council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6675.024s">I</a>  can think of one instance where the proprietor of the franchise was quite persistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6681.608s">In</a>  fact, the first time he petitioned us for extended hours, he arrived here with a dozen pizzas for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6688.273s">I</a>  did not partake. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6691.898s">And</a>  quite frankly, I don't partake of that brand at all, ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6697.681s">However,</a>  so many of my neighbors were quick to point out, and many of them made themselves present here, and many of them made an effort to contact me at my office to say that they did not want this going on because they did not want these cars speeding through the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6716.152s">As</a>  president, I've not been contacted by anybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6719.932s">uh,</a>  nor have I seen anybody present to speak in opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6724.813s">And</a>  I might say that the chairman has made an excellent measure by pointing out that we should have a 90 day review on this and that the, uh, uh, that if the, uh, extended hours of operation are granted, that they'd be granted only to the petitioner and not to a subsequent owner nor towards the property permanently. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6748.438s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6749.595s">Vice</a>  president marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6751.556s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6752.797s">And,</a>  um, the petitioner mentioned that he's only open till 10 PM. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6757.441s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6758.141s">Your</a>  license right now is until 11 until 11, but I close at 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6764.085s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6764.305s">So,</a>  so you're closing at 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6765.766s">You're</a>  able to open till 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6767.728s">Now</a>  you want to stay open till 2 AM.</p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6769.789s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6770.55s">Um,</a>  usually between, um, 9 PM to 11 is totally that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6778.688s">It's</a>  like a time to clean and go home. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6782.071s">Um,</a>  but when everybody else flows after 11 is when you can catch some businesses because we have something on online.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6792.879s">Mr.</a>  President, um, you know, we've taken these petitions, uh, for extended licenses, uh, based on a number of circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6801.726s">And,</a>  uh, each petition is an individual petition based on its own merits. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6807.048s">And</a>  I would venture to say, Mr. President, that this particular business is nestled between homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6813.733s">You</a>  have homes across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6815.494s">You</a>  have homes on either side, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6818.216s">And</a>  in my opinion, a 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6821.058s">closing</a>  would pose a severe quality of life issue for area residents in that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6828.503s">So</a>  even with a 90-day, which I think is a very <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6833.216s">amendable</a>  way of trying to put things through. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6836.278s">I</a>  don't support that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6839.119s">If</a>  the gentleman wanted to open maybe until midnight and start off at midnight, and that would give him 11 and 12, which he's not opening 11, he has my right, it would give him 11 and 12, and then see how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6854.086s">And</a>  then in six months from now or a year from now, say maybe I'd like to open till 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6858.969s">But</a>  to start off at 2 a.m., Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6861.837s">in</a>  an area that's already congested. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6865.079s">All</a>  those stores, as the gentleman mentioned, are closed after probably 11 o'clock's the latest, maybe midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6873.005s">And</a>  this would be two hours after that of hearing doors open and close and having this be, as the gentleman alluded to, the spot where you can go get a pizza at two in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6884.392s">And</a>  I don't know if the neighbors, in my opinion, are willing to put up with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6890.063s">And</a>  this is a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6891.324s">This</a>  is not by right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6892.584s">This</a>  is a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6893.965s">So</a>  at this time, Mr. President, I cannot sign off on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6898.327s">I'd</a>  be willing to go up to midnight on a provisional basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6903.83s">And</a>  then if we hear back from residents that everything's fine with midnight, maybe we could explore one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6909.352s">But</a>  to go right to 2 a.m., Mr. President, Mr. Clark, how many operations do we have in the city at 2 a.m.? ? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6916.04s">several</a>  citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6917.0s">But</a>  we have hundreds of businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6918.881s">We</a>  may have several that are open citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6921.161s">And</a>  again, Mr. President, I'm not saying anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6924.902s">I</a>  know that business has turned over a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6928.903s">I</a>  live right around the corner, and that's changed hands a number of times, that business, over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6934.244s">So</a>  I know it's been a tough location, and I wish you well there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6937.885s">But</a>  to me, 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6940.186s">is</a>  — I just can't support that based on the neighbors, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6947.705s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6948.646s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, I do believe we ran into a similar situation back when we were discussing the extended hours at the old Panda Palace location, which is now Shanghai moon. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6961.537s">And</a>  we did a phase it and we phased it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6964.44s">I</a>  believe we said for the first six months it would be X for the next three months it will be Y. Um, for the final three months it would be Z and we had a review step at each step of the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6973.648s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6974.582s">If</a>  the council is amenable, I mean, maybe that's a solution right now where we can help the gentleman out and there'll be an agreement that we give him a 90-day permit until midnight and then maybe a 90-day review after midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6985.812s">And</a>  then if there are no issues, it would revert for another 90-day period until 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6989.415s">And</a>  if there's no issues there, then it would revert to a 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6992.698s">license</a>  with another 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6994.32s">So</a>  in essence, we'd have, you know, a year and a half, a year and a half review. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=6999.655s">of</a>  the extended hours and they'd be gradually implemented so that if any instances or issues in the neighbourhood arise, we'll be able to nip them in the bud within 90 days of the event occurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7011.703s">And</a>  then we can always, you know, have an opportunity to correct the wrongs if any are made. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7016.826s">But</a>  if any aren't, then we can help the business owners succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7019.428s">I</a>  know the council has discussed the difficulty it is for businesses to be competitive in the City of Medford based upon a number of circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7029.098s">And</a>  I believe that the extended hours was a permitting process that was put in place to address some of those concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7035.322s">And</a>  I'm hoping that maybe we can all sit down here and put our heads together and come up with a methodology that might work for everybody involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7041.305s">So</a>  I'd ask the Councilor if he feels as though that would be a suitable recommendation to do an increase of one hour, reach 90 days with a 90-day review thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7051.271s">And</a>  maybe that'll be a solution of compromise for all involved.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7058.124s">I</a>  like the resolve through the chair.</p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7061.266s">But</a>  did you have you talked to your you said the neighbors are asking you to stay open because I forget a book but I have a lot of signatures from I collect like 120 now I know there's a couple homes across the street have you especially the across the street all of them they and they said I'm not I don't know I'm okay with that but I forgot especially is <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7087.464s">A</a>  guy across the street, he said, I received your letter, and I signed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7093.346s">I</a>  said, OK, it's not a problem.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7095.047s">Oh,</a>  and he signed your petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7096.627s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7097.728s">What</a>  time does Cafe Mari stay open, Tom? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7100.229s">Who?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7100.609s">Cafe</a>  Mari, the coffee shop there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7102.009s">I</a>  think always. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7103.15s">Is</a>  he one o'clock?</p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7105.27s">Something</a>  like that, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7108.57s">Sometimes</a>  like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7109.551s">Yeah,</a>  sometimes I stay late not open because I have to clean something or make prep things and I get out of there 1130 and they still open.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7117.557s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7121.14s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7122.361s">Um,</a>  I, I do have a couple of concerns regarding the late time, uh, stay until 2am. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7128.845s">Um,</a>  and I do like the staged approach as to, you know, just kind of maybe increasing it over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7133.909s">So</a>  I'm not completely against this, but, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7136.488s">How</a>  many drivers do you have delivering? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7139.29s">Right</a>  now, one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7140.351s">One.</a> </p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7140.911s">But</a>  I know if I get late, because I know the business from that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7145.135s">I</a>  have my friend experience in Somerville and Magoon Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7150.41s">He</a>  told me you probably need two more because it's busy time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7155.012s">Everybody</a>  is closed.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7156.713s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7157.873s">That's</a>  a little bit of my concern because if you're going to go until 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7162.475s">and</a>  then if you go up two drivers, you're going to have three drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7167.697s">Three</a>  drivers coming and going at 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7170.618s">is</a>  really doors opening, closing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7174.519s">You</a>  have cars driving around at 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7177.421s">in</a>  a residential <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7178.926s">That's</a>  a bit of a concern, to me at least, and I think that it's something that needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7185.187s">I</a>  want to see you succeed, believe me, but I also want to make sure that we're safeguarding the neighbourhood and making sure that people get a good night's sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7194.709s">If</a>  you have three drivers going back and forth at 2 a.m., especially if you're delivering up until 2, that means they might be coming back to the shop after 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7206.351s">So</a>  we're talking maybe 2.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7208.848s">you</a>  know, when you really look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7210.948s">So</a>  I would definitely be, you know, in favour of the compromised proposal by council tonight, you know, just kind of going in stages and maybe increasing, you know, over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7222.611s">But,</a>  you know, if you're going to be going from one driver to three drivers and having all those cars coming and going that late at night or early in the morning, that is definitely a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7233.453s">But</a>  I am definitely in favour of the staged approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7236.83s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7237.431s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7253.636s">Sunday,</a>  Monday, Tuesday is dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7256.697s">You</a>  know, Sundays everybody has to go to work or school. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7259.578s">It's</a>  dead. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7259.998s">There's</a>  no reason to stay on Monday or Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7262.918s">I</a>  want to do it Wednesday to Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7265.639s">Because</a>  I know people start to get money and pay checks weekends, you know, definitely.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7271.46s">Mr.</a>  President, I think it may make sense to, based upon the feedback that I think I'm receiving from my colleagues, that we put a 90-day review, grant a special permit from 11 to 12 with a 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7283.409s">If</a>  there are no instances or issues, that we will grant the automatic permit from 12 to 1 with a 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7291.194s">And</a>  if there are no issues thereafter, we grant a permit from 1 to 2 automatic with a 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7298.659s">Mr.</a>  President, I think that the last 90-day review, when the permit is in place from 1 to 2 a.m., should be restricted maybe to the Wednesday through Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7307.744s">Or</a>  maybe it should be restricted Wednesday through Saturday for the 12 to 1 and the 1 to 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7313.358s">so</a>  that we can get through the 90-day review periods with them operating Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, the extended hours, and then we can get a better feel from the neighborhood what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7322.725s">We'd</a>  be approving it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7323.446s">We</a>  wouldn't be approving it for seven days of the week, and we wouldn't be approving it 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7326.708s">We'd</a>  be gradually phasing it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7327.989s">So</a>  if any questions or concerns do arise, we'll be able to address them within short order. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7332.772s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7333.373s">Mr.</a>  Bozo, are you happy with that?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7335.154s">No,</a>  that's fine.</p>

    <p>[DXZ3Y2L8Tik_SPEAKER_11]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7335.995s">You're</a>  fine with that? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7336.575s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7337.155s">Thank</a>  you for any help.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7342.967s">On</a>  the boat, vice president of box, just so I can understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7348.411s">So</a>  will the petitioner then appear before us in 90 days or cause I heard automatic mentioned one, one time when you were mentioning it, um, where I was looking at it was if there's no issue that arises, if there's no concern, no complaint, then</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7363.377s">it</a>  automatically be granted the next level of, so, so if there's one complaint that he's not going to get approved, we'll bring him in and we'll discuss it and figure out what's going on.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7370.542s">That's</a>  why I think he should come in automatically.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7372.764s">And</a>  that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7373.984s">I'll</a>  be quite honest with him is I don't mind the phase, but I won't go past a 1am at any point. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7380.489s">I</a>  think 2am is too much to ask for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7383.791s">So</a>  I don't mind the first phase to go up to midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7386.673s">I</a>  might even support the one depending on feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7389.85s">But</a>  I'm definitely not going to go up to 2 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7391.971s">in</a>  that particular area, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7394.031s">I</a>  think it's a fair compromise and I'd support that wholeheartedly, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7396.932s">I'm</a>  doing a 90-day review, bringing them back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7398.672s">I</a>  think that that's a good way to proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7400.393s">It</a>  protects the neighborhood and it also helps the business owner compete.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7403.094s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7406.175s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, with the stipulations that we have, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo, this is a special permit, so it does need <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7419.162s">five</a>  votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7420.703s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7426.968s">He</a>  goes with the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7429.129s">It'll</a>  be 90 days from 12 o'clock.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7562.557s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President and you know this has been an issue that's been on the council agenda probably for the last several years and it's an issue that I believe is one of the top three issues <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7579.005s">that</a>  I feel as a member of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7581.865s">And</a>  it's been, it's been very consistent over the years, the poor condition of our roads and the fact that, uh, in my opinion, uh, the city really doesn't have a game plan on, uh, repairing the roads or replacing our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7599.829s">And</a>  I did a little homework and went into, uh, the engineering department last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7606.33s">I</a>  went into the finance department. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7608.263s">to</a>  get a little information on really what we're doing as a community on our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7613.788s">And</a>  I found it pretty interesting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7616.97s">First</a>  of all, a lion's share of the money we receive every year to do road work comes from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7624.837s">It</a>  comes from Chapter 90 money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7627.419s">And</a>  many people at home may not know, but Chapter 90 money is a program that entitles municipalities to 100% reimbursement <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7637.635s">of</a>  documented expenditures on approved projects for maintaining <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7642.68s">repairing,</a>  improving and constructing town and county ways and bridges. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7649.326s">So</a>  we get roughly $900,000 a year through this chapter 90 money earmarked to improvement of our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7659.075s">We</a>  also get, and it fluctuates year to year, we get money from the office of community development for road repair and that could vary from <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7670.193s">150,000</a>  to 300,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7673.034s">So</a>  you're looking at roughly $1.1 million a year allocation to improve our roads from the state and actually OCD, which comes from, I believe, the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7688.458s">The</a>  allocation amount is based on three different factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7692.539s">How</a>  many road miles do you have in your community? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7695.799s">That</a>  weighs in at a 58% <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7700.43s">So</a>  it's very important how many road miles you have in your community when they allocate this money through Chapter 90. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7706.516s">Population</a>  is 20.83% of the formula. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7712.102s">So</a>  your population size weighs in on how much money you get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7716.857s">the</a>  employment within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7718.878s">Do</a>  you have high or low employment in the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7721.978s">That</a>  weighs in also at 20.83%. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7725.299s">So</a>  all those three factors, uh, will, uh, be what determines how the state allocates this chapter 90 money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7734.482s">And,</a>  uh, in 2018, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7737.146s">The</a>  governor is allocating $200 million for the entire state. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7742.768s">Our</a>  allocation for the city of Medford, based on the three factors, we have 91 miles of road in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7750.69s">Our</a>  population is roughly 56,173. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7756.21s">And</a>  our employment is about 18,474 in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7761.536s">So</a>  based on those numbers, where we average with all the other communities, we're receiving 944,095. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7771.558s">in</a>  dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7772.779s">Last</a>  year, we received $951,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7775.3s">The</a>  prior year, FY16, $950,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7779.721s">So</a>  it's been very consistent over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7783.103s">And</a>  we move forward, and we spend the money, and then we get reimbursed by the state through this Chapter 90 money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7792.146s">The</a>  unfortunate thing about it, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7795.051s">is</a>  that's all we're putting towards the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7797.873s">Whatever</a>  we get through Chapter 90, which is great, 100% reimbursement, sign me up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7804.837s">But</a>  there's a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7806.619s">It's</a>  great that we get it, but it's not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7809.801s">And</a>  we've been doing this for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7812.022s">And</a>  we know that our roads have not improved over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7815.825s">So</a>  it's clear to me, when you look at these figures, that we're never gonna get ahead of the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7821.228s">We're</a>  always gonna be chasing our tail on the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7825.647s">We</a>  have 730 streets in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7830.35s">40%</a>  of them are private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7832.691s">So</a>  we have 292 private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7835.792s">Now</a>  most people will say, ha ha, I live on a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7839.354s">Guess</a>  what? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7840.355s">There's</a>  no living on a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7845.398s">It</a>  might be because in certain circumstances, you may have to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7850.925s">You</a>  may have to pay to have a tree limb taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7854.008s">You</a>  may have to pay to have a sidewalk done because you're on a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7859.273s">Um,</a>  the rest of the roads, uh, and that's 60 a city streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7867.54s">So</a>  I took a look at the numbers over the last four and a half, close to five years to try to get a picture on how many streets we doing per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7876.663s">And</a>  how much money are we getting from the state? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7879.226s">And</a>  at what point are we going to be able to complete our streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7883.271s">You</a>  know, we hear about complete streets all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7886.014s">That's</a>  the biggest misnomer ever, complete streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7889.458s">We</a>  get 500,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7889.878s">We</a>  do a few small projects and we call it complete streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7894.403s">I</a>  don't know what they're completed, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7896.512s">That's</a>  what we call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7897.332s">So</a>  over the past four and a half years, we've paved altogether 30 streets in the city over four and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7906.896s">I</a>  like to round it off to five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7909.256s">Out</a>  of the 30 streets, nine were full streets where we ground the street down and repaved it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7917.219s">So</a>  we did nine full streets in almost five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7920.72s">And</a>  the other 21 streets were partial. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7923.661s">They</a>  went up 500 yards on a road. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7926.295s">or</a>  they went from one intersection to the first intersection of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7930.76s">So</a>  they weren't full streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7932.501s">But</a>  for my point, Mr. President, rather than trying to figure this out, I'm going to go based on the 30 streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7939.268s">So</a>  this city does 30 streets every five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7943.452s">So</a>  that's what? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7944.193s">Six</a>  streets a year, if you average it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7947.596s">A</a>  street grind and repave. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7950.508s">which</a>  we heard tonight in Committee of the Whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7954.169s">The</a>  repaving is not lost, used to 2025, and that could be for increased traffic on a, trucking on a street, and pulling off the tie, which we heard from DPW tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7971.696s">But</a>  a typical grind and pave, 15 times, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7978.422s">So</a>  if you take this and logically go through it, if we continue to pave the streets every five years, after 20 years, we will have of the 438 streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=7994.467s">At</a>  that point of after five years, and then after 20 years, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8015.828s">We'll</a>  be working on 15 to 20. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8021.552s">This</a>  address any of the private roads I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8027.236s">So</a>  when you add in the other 300 roads, the figures that I'm coming up with are strictly only going based off the streets that I considered private, which is 438. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8039.088s">According</a>  to get out, Mr. President, we will never, ever in the way we're spending allocating money on our streets, we will never, ever get ahead on repaving our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8053.157s">We</a>  are always going to be catching up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8054.998s">We</a>  are always going to be doing our streets piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8058.78s">I</a>  asked the city engineer's office, can you provide me with a list, a working list of the next priority of streets? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8068.059s">I</a>  could not get one. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8069.58s">I</a>  could get a list of the 30 streets that were done over the past four and a half years, but I couldn't get a street listing of what the next priorities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8080.73s">And</a>  I think that's some of the frustration with feeling behind this reel when residents come up and say, you know, my street hasn't been looked at in six decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8091.219s">Six</a>  decades. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8093.341s">So,</a>  Mr. President, it's clear to me <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8096.604s">In</a>  order to get ahead of the curve, we as a city can take advantage of the Chapter 90 money and the reimbursement, but we also have to put money, allocate money in our budget every year in DPW or engineering, specifically for road repavement, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8117.471s">And</a>  if we allocate an additional million dollars in that year, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8122.863s">We</a>  go up from 28% of the streets that are being done in five years to 52% or 54%, whatever the math comes out to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8133.433s">It</a>  has that much of an impact, adding another million dollars a year to our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8140.304s">So,</a>  you know, knowing it's the top, in my opinion, one of the top three priorities in this community, knowing that we're never going to get ahead from previous experience on the money we're receiving, that we need to do this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8155.198s">We</a>  as a council, during this year's budget, I'm sure other councils have other priorities, traffic engineer and a lot of other issues out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8163.568s">But</a>  we as a council have to stand up as a body and say, you know what, based on the complaints we get, based on the poor condition of our streets, based on a number of issues, Madam Mayor, we need you to add an additional $1 million <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8179.77s">$2</a>  million would be even better. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8181.151s">That'd</a>  be 75% of our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8183.274s">$3</a>  million would be a panacea and bring us to a target level of completing all our streets after a certain number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8194.124s">That</a>  may not be realistic, Mr. President, but I think at least putting an additional million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8200.71s">Now</a>  we can all talk a big game when the residents come up, and we can sympathize, and we can cry crocodile tears when they come up and say, oh my God, that's awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8209.538s">But</a>  we have to do something as a council, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8212.921s">We</a>  have to stand up and take action. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8216.424s">And</a>  this is the only way it's gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8218.126s">Have</a>  you ever heard anyone from the city administration step up and say, we need more money for the roads? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8223.59s">Absolutely</a>  not, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8226.09s">I've</a>  been on this council 16 years, Mr. President, and I've never heard one person from DPW, engineering, or the city administration ever step up and say, you know what, based on the poor condition of our roads, we need some additional funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8242.72s">I</a>  received a number of pitches via email because this was on the agenda and the street <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8255.456s">that</a>  are sinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8256.357s">By</a>  the way, the Chapter 9 money is used not just to repave, it's used for infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8263.744s">So</a>  if you have a catch basin that's sinking, that money can be used to rebuild the catch basin. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8270.37s">If</a>  you have a manhole cover that's sinking or has potholes all around it, that could be used to fix the manhole cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8277.525s">You</a>  have curbing that's level with the street now, like Riverside Ave, that I've been complaining about, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8284.691s">When</a>  you drive down Riverside Ave, the curbing is level with the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8288.874s">How</a>  unsafe is that? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8292.097s">So</a>  these are the infrastructure improvements, Mr. President, along with sidewalks as well, that can be done with this money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8298.763s">And</a>  in my opinion, it's long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8301.645s">It's</a>  a top issue in this community, public safety and roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8305.772s">And,</a>  uh, we need to address it, Mr. President, just to give people an idea what it costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8311.634s">Um,</a>  Stearns Ave in South Method had their road repaved not too long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8318.176s">Um,</a>  I think it was back in 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8321.737s">It</a>  was a few years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8323.878s">And</a>  that street, which probably has maybe 12 homes the length of the street, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8329.453s">maybe</a>  13, cost the city $85,000 for full grind and a repave. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8338.256s">So</a>  I think it puts it in perspective, knowing the size of that street and comparing it to other streets that, you know, we can get through a lot of streets if we put the money towards it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8349.54s">We</a>  can accomplish our goals if we're able, Mr. President, to make this a priority, which it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8357.04s">You</a>  shouldn't have to use radar when you're running down the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8361.703s">I</a>  come down the streets, I know exactly where the potholes are. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8364.165s">I</a>  go like that, I drive, I know exactly where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8366.847s">I</a>  know where the manhole covers are too low, I know where all the bumps are, and it's a shame, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8372.371s">That</a>  shows you how long that our roads have been inflicted with these ripples and potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8379.336s">So</a>  I would respectfully ask my colleagues, Mr. President, on a vote tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8384.35s">To</a>  ask the mayor, I know we just received some of our budget and we got our budget book and we're going to start meeting with department heads, that this is in the early stages of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8395.422s">We</a>  haven't sat down at all yet that a million dollars be appropriated, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8400.908s">towards</a>  the repaving of our roads and that we also have a systematic approach on priorities of roads that need to be repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8411.277s">So</a>  we don't have to go to the engineering office and say, well, we really don't have a list. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8416.941s">It's</a>  done by calls that we receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8419.643s">Then</a>  we go out and look at them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8421.405s">And</a>  then if the mayor wants to do them, we get them done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8426.73s">You</a>  know, there's really no list, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8429.093s">There</a>  should be a list on the city website that any resident can go there and see if they're on the priority list, see where their street falls, and expect the date that their street may be done, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8440.909s">This</a>  is not rocket science. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8443.743s">And</a>  again, as I preference my remarks all the time, this is no reflection on a depleted DPW department. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8452.548s">It's</a>  no reflection on the good work that they do, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8456.511s">But</a>  clearly, you know, from past experience and from past knowledge that we're going nowhere, how we're currently operating with repaving our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8468.618s">And</a>  I offer this, Mr. President, as a way to <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8472.781s">have</a>  an approach that can address one of the top concerns from residents that contact me, phone me, email me, stop me at stop and shop or wherever else I am about the condition of our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8485.989s">So</a>  I would ask that in a formal vote tonight, Mr. President, that we request the mayor put an additional million dollars in the paving budget for either DPW or engineering.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8498.918s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8501.93s">Mr.</a>  President, several months ago this council voted on a resolution that I sponsored requesting that the DPW perform a complete assessment of our streets and the resolution requested that they consider adopting new technology and right now there is an opportunity for the City of Medford to utilize infrared technology and it pretty much is a truck that drives down the street and takes an x-ray of the road and uses infrared technology to determine <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8527.107s">the</a>  quality of the infrastructure below the ground, as well as the defects of the infrastructure above the ground, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8532.948s">I've</a>  had the opportunity to take a look at one of these machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8535.649s">A</a>  local business on Mystic Avenue, Millennium Power Sweeping, is in possession of one, and this tool can work miracles. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8544.05s">It</a>  can repair potholes and do a whole entire assessment of the roadway all in one felt swoop, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8553.183s">I</a>  certainly think that this is a noble resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8557.325s">I</a>  don't know if a million bucks is going to be enough, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8560.246s">I</a>  don't think not. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8561.407s">If</a>  we're going to be putting out a budget, we're looking to add $1 million to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8565.489s">This</a>  budget is funded by ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8586.094s">However,</a>  I would like to include in this resolution an amendment asking that, number one, the infrared technology be utilized, and number two, I think that it's important that the public be informed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8606.442s">maybe</a>  do a trial run with the truck?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8609.763s">I</a>  do believe that they've done that already, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8612.444s">And</a>  I think that Melanie might have been utilized to do a test run, performing repairs to some cracks on some basketball courts to show how far along technology's come. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8625.227s">So</a>  I certainly don't have a problem asking for a complete assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8629.768s">I</a>  think it's premature to request funding until we get the assessment done, because we really don't know what it's going to cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8633.909s">I</a>  think Councilor Marks has done a great job putting this <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8636.383s">I</a>  would like an opportunity to review the numbers a little further. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8642.257s">I</a>  did get a response from the administration that it would cost about $7 million to <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8646.663s">We</a>  can pave our emergency arteries in their entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8649.604s">And</a>  the question comes is whether or not we can use tax agent money to do that or if there are other funding sources that are available to us as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8655.207s">So</a>  I certainly can appreciate the resolution, however, for us right now to add a million dollars to the proposed budget I think is premature. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8663.371s">I</a>  think we should start a budget discussions and deliberations and find out where money's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8668.493s">Based</a>  on last year's fiscal year budget, I think we have close to 605. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8672.266s">$100,000</a>  of money that's used for contracted services, for services that could be performed in-house that's being performed out-house, for services that could go towards paying for salaries to replete the DPW staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8683.233s">So</a>  there's a number of items that we need to look at, Mr. President, and this is a priority, but there are other priorities as well, as the Councilor noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8689.236s">So</a>  I can certainly stand behind the resolution to ask for the assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8693.099s">However,</a>  at this point in time, I'd feel very uncomfortable requesting that $1 million be added to the budget without further discussion to liberation and investigation.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8700.838s">Point</a>  of information of Vice President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8703.34s">The</a>  councilor mentioned that he asked for the assessment back several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8706.543s">Did</a>  we get a copy of the assessment?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8708.845s">I</a>  believe we got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8711.046s">We</a>  were supposed to get it on the 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8712.407s">We</a>  haven't got it yet according to the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8714.009s">So</a>  we haven't got anything based on the resolution you offered.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8717.051s">I</a>  believe we got a response saying that they'll look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8720.294s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8720.774s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8721.074s">So</a>  we haven't got anything back. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8722.676s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8723.672s">In</a>  my opinion, we can ask again, which is great, I have no problem asking again, but I think people are tired of hearing about the ask and want to see action. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8735.083s">I</a>  think asking for a million dollars in the budget is action, Mr. President, that will result in the repaving of streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8742.23s">and</a>  not just a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8744.671s">I</a>  agree and I voted for the x-raying of streets and so forth, but I haven't seen a response back, so I'm not gonna put too much credibility into that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8755.658s">I'd</a>  rather see some action. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8757.078s">Mr.</a>  President, we do have money that's already appropriated for the paving of Evans Street and Harris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8760.56s">I</a>  don't think we've seen that happen either, and the money's there.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8894.412s">Jean</a>  Muzo, 35 Paris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8897.532s">The</a>  last time we spoke about potholes, I told you all that I didn't know the last time Paris Street was paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8903.594s">Someone</a>  reached out and advised me that the last time Paris Street was paved, they watched it from the window of the Curtis School. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8911.377s">as</a>  beetle mania hit the United States in 1964. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8914.118s">So</a>  that's the last time Paris street was paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8917.38s">So</a>  I'm not surprised to hear that within the next century we may only see another 50 of Medford's roads attended to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8924.704s">I</a>  find it interesting that 30 roads have been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8929.086s">And</a>  through the chair, I'd be curious to know if a single one on the north side of Medford has been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8934.729s">Because</a>  I have said repeatedly that our side of the city has really seen <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8940.442s">No</a>  attention whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8942.482s">Not</a>  roads, not sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8945.263s">But</a>  it sounds like maybe that's not a bad thing based upon the committee of the whole meeting tonight that we heard about the poor quality of the hot top and asphalt that is coming out probably for any number of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8959.966s">But</a>  1964 was the last time Parry Street was paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8963.666s">And</a>  we have not really had our potholes attended to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8969.055s">I</a>  would love to see some additional funding put towards this and I don't want to be greedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8976.619s">I</a>  would even be happy with key cut properly filled potholes rather than potholes that have some attention given to them as a band aid for the short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8989.866s">I</a>  think many people might say to spread that across a little bit more and have equitable <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=8998.692s">repair</a>  those potholes that are causing the most damage, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9004.295s">It</a>  doesn't all have to be in one place, certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9006.936s">But,</a>  you know, again, 1964 was the last time our street saw any attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9012.919s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9013.219s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9410.57s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9410.95s">I'll</a>  be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9412.75s">I</a>  think we are very frustrated with the state of our roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9417.252s">I've</a>  voiced my opinion the last several weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9420.553s">Luckily</a>  we did have a meeting with the DPW director and head of DPW this evening and <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9428.741s">It</a>  is discouraging. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9430.102s">The</a>  crews are out there, they sit on a daily basis working to repair our roads and fix potholes and try to fix manhole covers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9439.365s">I</a>  see the patches all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9441.566s">And</a>  the complaints from what I understand are 60 recent complaints on see, click, fix just for potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9453.271s">And</a>  I specifically asked, are we <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9455.862s">Are</a>  we working just with regards to the potholes on complaint basis? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9459.385s">And</a>  that's the state that we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9462.427s">We're</a>  understaffed and we're working just on complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9465.829s">Now,</a>  there are potholes and problems all over our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9470.312s">And</a>  to go into Evans street and Paris street, there's many other roads that need resurfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9475.596s">So</a>  I think what we're hearing tonight is we have a budget to review and a request for a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9482.37s">that</a>  comes from frustration, and I, too, am very frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9485.712s">So</a>  whether it's a million dollars or half a million or even just a plan to be put in place that we're doing more than five streets a year from what I understand through Council Mark's research, we need more. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9501.003s">We</a>  need to have more in this budget, and there are places that you can trim. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9505.526s">There</a>  are a number of different things that can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9507.608s">We</a>  have $9 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9511.448s">committing</a>  every year to put more than $950,000 into repaving and fixing our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9518.491s">And</a>  that's the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9520.352s">So</a>  whether we vote for a million tonight or we discuss it at budget time, I'm in support of putting more than what chapter 90 funds allows us to put into our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9531.498s">We</a>  as a city are taxing our residents on every level. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9536.22s">We</a>  need to be able to give them a safe, proper place to drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9541.584s">That</a>  is the bottom line, and I appreciate the resolution and see where it goes, but the bottom line is we need to dedicate more time, whether that's hiring more manpower, buying more fill, things need to be done that are not being done now.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9558.434s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9559.414s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9561.515s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9562.936s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Marksley bringing this up because it is the number one concern we have in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9570.163s">In</a>  a daily basis, I think that most communities don't go to the city council meetings and put potholes on their agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9581.486s">So</a>  I feel for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9583.786s">But</a>  I think that going through the budget and being fiscally responsible to what we see, because I don't want to be in a position where <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9595.449s">we're</a>  being held accountable for losing other city necessities. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9602.392s">So</a>  I think it's important that the budget season comes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9606.034s">I'm</a>  supporting Council Marks, his process that during the budget time, I will stand by him with the million or more and looking into other avenues as free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9620.3s">But</a>  until we have that budget meeting, I think it's important that we hear <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9625.81s">what</a>  is upon us in the next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9627.671s">I</a>  know that, uh, Saturday, I believe, uh, is going to be a very interesting day and long day, but it's going to be, uh, it's going to be something that I think all of us have heard and all of us sitting at a table would really stress the fact that streets and our roads are going to be on number one, one of our number one priority.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9648.458s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9650.379s">Councilor</a>  box. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9651.439s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9652.419s">I</a>  appreciate my colleagues, uh, comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9655.596s">Let's</a>  remember, this council cannot add to the city budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9660.839s">This</a>  is a request by the council based on years of previous experience that we can't continue to operate the way we're doing business and expect our roads to get completed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9674.486s">That's</a>  all this is to open up dialogue and discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9677.968s">So</a>  don't be hell-bent on, oh, a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9682.187s">It's</a>  to open up discussion and dialogue and to let the mayor know that there's a need in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9689.049s">You</a>  know, Councilor Lungo-Koehn talked about we have $8,239,000 in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9692.01s">That</a>  could be used for roads, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9701.222s">We</a>  have linkage money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9703.184s">We're</a>  one of just a few communities in the entire state that when development comes in over a certain size, whether it's a rehab or new development, we charge a certain percentage to linkage for infrastructure improvements, like the gentleman that lives on Riverside Ave said. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9720.628s">Wouldn't</a>  that be a novelty, you know, when Wegmans comes in, because they're going to pay linkage to this community, that a certain percent goes to the infrastructure around that particular area to improve access and to improve pedestrian safety, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9736.807s">So</a>  there's plenty of money available. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9740.268s">So</a>  don't get caught up on whether or not a million dollars and we're going to have to cut something. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9744.728s">No,</a>  we're not talking about cuts at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9746.449s">We</a>  want to present this to the mayor saying, Madam Mayor, whether it's through linkage, free certified, free cash, or any other venue that you can think of, we need to do a better job. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9757.611s">And</a>  as I mentioned earlier, the $950,000 we receive every year in Chapter 90 money is just not footing the bill in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9766.595s">And</a>  it's evident, it's evident. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9769.076s">These</a>  streets are the worst I've seen in my, I don't want to date myself now, but I've been driving 30 years on these streets, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9778.558s">And</a>  they're the worst I've ever seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9779.998s">There's</a>  a problem and it exists and we have to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9784.879s">And</a>  we can ask for all the reports and all the different studies, but you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9789.883s">Let's</a>  take some action. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9791.484s">Let's</a>  put money in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9793.025s">Let's</a>  get money out of certified free cash and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9796.468s">Let's</a>  get a list of priorities and start moving forward on these streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9800.291s">And</a>  rather than see six a year, Mr. President, let's look at 15 to 20 streets a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9807.096s">Then</a>  we'll make some headway and get ahead of ourselves, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9811.179s">So</a>  that's why it was offered tonight, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9813.421s">I'm</a>  not asking anyone behind this real, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9815.364s">to</a>  make decisions tonight on cutting out something within the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9819.266s">No,</a>  this is to start discussion and dialogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9823.028s">This,</a>  in my opinion, is warranted, and I have the proof. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9829.791s">I'll</a>  send my council colleagues the emails I've received from pitches around the community, and I ask Mr. President for support of this tonight, to send a message, a shot across the bow, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9843.835s">and</a>  to let her know that we're serious about this and it's not going to just be another rubber stamp on the FY 18 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9851.038s">This</a>  council wants some action and some results. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9853.399s">Mr.</a>  President, you yourself said we've had more community, the whole meetings and subcommittee meetings and push more new ordinances forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9861.343s">That's</a>  also get some results when it comes to infrastructure in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9865.465s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice president.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9867.626s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9868.866s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9869.446s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9870.307s">I'd</a>  also like to thank councilor marks for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9873.807s">I</a>  think it's important to open the dialogue and talk about issues like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9878.568s">This</a>  is an issue that impacts every neighbourhood throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9884.529s">The</a>  roads are in terrible condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9887.59s">Not</a>  all the roads but a great percentage are in pretty bad shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9892.871s">I</a>  definitely would support an audit on the roads in prioritizing <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9900.195s">reconstructing</a>  some of the roads, resurfacing some of the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9904.357s">I</a>  also believe that, you know, the states, if we're getting money from getting chapter 90 funding for, you know, rehabilitating the roads and if we're getting funding from some funding from the federal government through OCD funds, you know, we probably should be actually taking some money. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9922.06s">from</a>  the city, you know, we should probably take a look to see if there is any money in available accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9926.482s">To</a>  put it towards the roads, we should be investing in ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9930.063s">And,</a>  you know, if there are surplus funds that we could take and maybe it's not a million dollars, but maybe it's a start, maybe we can find some funding, then maybe we should do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9940.768s">But</a>  I think it is, you know, something that we should take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9944.049s">You</a>  know, we should be willing to reinvest in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9946.55s">I</a>  mean, you know, we get state funding, we get federal funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9949.391s">Let's</a>  take a look at, you know, what we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=9951.643s">to</a>  see what we can actually put into reinvesting in ourselves, reinvesting in our city and making it a better place and making better neighborhoods with smoother roads and improving the quality of life.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10233.108s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10234.749s">If</a>  he could clarify, because we voted on that thing not too long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10239.052s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10240.433s">The</a>  amendment would be that the city utilize the newest technology that's out there, which is the infrared technology, just similar to the same way we requested.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10252.62s">So</a>  it is a request of expenditure. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10254.321s">He's</a>  asking for the city to use this infrared <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10256.355s">technology</a>  to evaluate the care to evaluate To do the infrared technology and the response back would be it'll cost three million dollars a year to do it No, you asked them to use that during the assessment Right. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10267.978s">You</a>  did you just say I asked them to evaluate the utilization and use infrared you said To evaluate the utilization Just kind of like your resolution now you're changing it now, okay</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10283.655s">Ultimately,</a>  it was to evaluate the use. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10284.975s">The</a>  same resolution we put forward before. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10286.836s">Same</a>  resolution we all voted for before.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10696.59s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10699.111s">This</a>  is a very important issue that leak detection, this council has been discussing for a number of years due to the high water and sewer rates in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10711.016s">Not</a>  only leak detection, but INI, inflow. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10712.937s">My</a>  mic's not on, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10715.698s">Oh,</a>  mine is, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10717.318s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10717.639s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10719.98s">That's</a>  all right, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10721.7s">So</a>  this is an important issue, Mr. President, that this council has been discussing <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10726.223s">for</a>  a number of years, leak detection in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10729.265s">We've</a>  also discussed I&I inflow and infiltration. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10733.149s">It's</a>  costing the ratepayers of this community millions of dollars a year based on water that's leaking in our old, outdated water pipes that are underground. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10743.897s">A</a>  little known fact, Mr. President, about 90% of the water leaks never surface. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10750.802s">So</a>  you may think, well, if we have water leaks, we're going to see water leaking down streets and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10755.985s">90%</a>  of the water never surfaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10758.247s">According</a>  to the MWRA, 17% to 20% of the water used in Medford each year is unaccounted for water that's lost to leakage. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10768.273s">So</a>  you can imagine that figure. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10772.27s">as</a>  well as unaccountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10774.332s">It's</a>  not me or anyone else's responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10780.236s">The</a>  new system, which I worked on for some six months, at the time, the company claimed in five years, Method could save about $5 million with this leak detection system and save up to 15 million gallons of water annually by installing this system. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10802.005s">In</a>  my opinion, Mr. President, a no-brainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10805.647s">It's</a>  long overdue in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10808.149s">I</a>  believe it's money well spent that over the years will find its way to the ratepayer and we can actually start seeing potentially a savings when it comes to our water and sewer bill or at least not see the steady increases that we've grown accustomed to. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10825.359s">Additionally,</a>  Mr. President, that <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10829.845s">with</a>  this particular leak detection system. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10832.447s">What</a>  we were told by the president is that you need appropriate staff to monitor this system. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10840.311s">And</a>  right now, as we all know, we don't have the appropriate staff to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10846.995s">So</a>  I'm hoping, which will accompany this paper, also an additional request for staff, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10855.84s">The</a>  way the system works, and I think it's <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10857.801s">appropriate</a>  people in this community know is that the company, whoever gets selected, would install an acoustic whistling device on the water mains in the gap valves between streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10871.897s">They</a>  would be spaced out in a big grid across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10874.84s">The</a>  company would listen to the device overnight and there's <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10879.965s">and</a>  they could tell where the leaks are coming from by taking samples of the acoustic sounds and pinpointing within a couple of feet where we have leaks in the community and then be able to prioritize those leaks and address them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10894.59s">And</a>  hopefully over time, we'll be addressing and lowering the percentage of unaccounted for water within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10902.733s">So</a>  I've been pushing for leak detection for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10906.615s">INI</a>  inflow and infiltration is a whole other thing in the community, which is another issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10912.633s">I've</a>  been pushing for, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10914.954s">That's</a>  groundwater that's seeping into our sewer system and being treated as raw sewage, which is costing the ratepayers of this community tens of millions of dollars a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10926.101s">The</a>  one thing I would ask, Mr. President, that my colleagues consider is that currently, right now, the school system and the city do not pay for their water. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10939.462s">It</a>  is not included in the operating budget for the schools and for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10945.965s">One</a>  knows any homeowner knows when you have your, you look at your car insurance, you look at your groceries and water and sewer is part of your budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10955.969s">It's</a>  part of operating so you can flush your toilet, take showers, water your lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10960.17s">It's</a>  part of the budget and our city for some reason, not part of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10965.73s">And</a>  guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10966.29s">When</a>  it's not part of the budget, Mr. President, what happens? <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10969.812s">You</a>  tend not to conserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10971.053s">It</a>  doesn't matter how much water I'm using. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10974.654s">The</a>  ratepayers will pay for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10975.955s">It</a>  doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10977.596s">We'll</a>  just add it on to the ratepayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10980.877s">They'll</a>  grin and bear it and take it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10983.759s">You</a>  know, if these buildings are meted, it should be part of the overall working budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10990.002s">It</a>  should be part of the budget, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10992.243s">It</a>  shouldn't be outside of a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=10994.707s">And</a>  in order to make this system work, we have to account for every entity in this community, and that includes the school system and also the municipal buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11004.796s">And</a>  there's no reason why, Mr. President, where those buildings are needed that we're not accounting for them in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11011.402s">When</a>  I was on the school committee back some years ago, it was part of the operating budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11016.392s">And</a>  then Mayor McGlynn, because he found out a good way of shifting it off of the Prop 2.5 within the budget, and said, I could put that within the ratepayers and also increase my budget on other things that I want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11031.818s">And,</a>  Mr. President, it should work that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11033.959s">Just</a>  recently, the administration asked us to combine the water and sewer enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11039.862s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11040.602s">Because</a>  it was easy for accounting for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11043.87s">So</a>  why would they approach us and say, you know what, we also want to make sure that our buildings that are already needed, that we include them in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11053.412s">I'm</a>  telling you right now, Mr. President, there are several issues that if they're not addressed in this budget, like I did last year, and I know Councilor Lungo, I will not support this budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11063.395s">I</a>  will not support it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11065.695s">The</a>  mayor will have to account on the other members. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11069.916s">But</a>  unless we hold our feet, Mr. President, to the fire, <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11073.48s">and</a>  make sure we address these issues and not just give lip service, that's the time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11080.543s">So,</a>  Mr. President, I support this wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11083.164s">I</a>  would hope that we also have a discussion on staffing to be able to look at these leaks and instantaneously get a report to show where these leaks are. <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11095.69s">And</a>  also, Mr. President, that once again, the school side and the municipal side include the water <a href="https://youtu.be/4oI-i0j4VnY&t=11103.051s">and</a>  sewer within their budgeting process.</p>
