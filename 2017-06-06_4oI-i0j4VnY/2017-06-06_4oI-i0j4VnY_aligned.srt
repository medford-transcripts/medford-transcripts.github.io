32
00:21:40,545 --> 00:21:45,706
To the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Memphis Mass.

33
00:21:46,126 --> 00:21:48,007
Dear Mr. President and City Councilors,

34
00:21:48,646 --> 00:22:03,953
I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the appropriation of certified free cash in the amount of $49,000 for Riverbend Contamination LSP services.

35
00:22:04,674 --> 00:22:07,635
The balance in certified cash prior to this vote is $8,239,329.

36
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:22,076
Alicia Hunt, Director of Energy and Environment, will be present to answer any questions.

37
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:24,158
Ms.

38
00:22:24,198 --> 00:22:24,678
Hunt, please.

39
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,503
Mr. Clerk, if you would please note Mr. Counselor Scott Pelley's presence.

40
00:22:33,105 --> 00:22:34,186
Name and address of the record, please.

41
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:39,170
Alicia Hunt, Director of Energy and Environment, 41 Watson Street, Medford.

42
00:22:43,577 --> 00:22:47,178
So I'm not sure how much background is helpful for the council.

43
00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:55,400
I know you all received the press release that was sent out about a month ago that contamination lead was found in the soil at river bend park.

44
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,061
That part of the park has been fenced off.

45
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:05,543
And in order to take the fencing down, we need to do a series of testing.

46
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,504
Sorry, there's a weird echo on the mic.

47
00:23:09,084 --> 00:23:12,385
To do a series of testing, borings to

48
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:23,750
understand just how deep the contamination goes, what the contamination is and the extent of it, and then we can have a solution developed depending on exactly what is there.

49
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:37,137
So in order to get that moving, so you will see there is money actually in my budget for next fiscal year to continue with this program of moving this project forward.

50
00:23:37,735 --> 00:23:42,197
However, the question that everybody wants to know is how soon can we take that fence down?

51
00:23:42,877 --> 00:23:59,822
And in order to take it down soonest, we want to begin the work with our LSP, the testing and the reporting as soon as possible so that we can determine what the solution is and then come back and say, here's what the solution, here's what we're recommending to do.

52
00:24:00,803 --> 00:24:07,505
But we basically didn't want to wait until July to get started on this, but really get started as soon as possible.

53
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,611
on this work.

54
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:13,575
Do we know how long it'll take to actually do the testing?

55
00:24:14,856 --> 00:24:20,321
So he said it would be about, he'd be out there like two to three days with the equipment.

56
00:24:20,341 --> 00:24:21,622
They're actually going to do borings.

57
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:26,687
They have to go down 15 feet, but they would be small borings.

58
00:24:28,128 --> 00:24:33,373
And then it would take about on the order of two weeks to get the test results back.

59
00:24:35,317 --> 00:24:39,959
And then there's also a series of reports that have to happen at certain prescribed times with the state.

60
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,679
Okay.

61
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:41,880
Okay.

62
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,260
Thank you.

63
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,461
Councilor Nice.

64
00:24:45,481 --> 00:24:46,681
Mr. President, thank you very much.

65
00:24:46,741 --> 00:24:46,862
Ms.

66
00:24:46,882 --> 00:24:48,102
Hunt, thank you for being here this evening.

67
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:55,365
I'm wondering if you can explain to us a little bit about what the contaminants are in the ground there and what you're aware of with the contaminants in the ground right there.

68
00:24:55,385 --> 00:24:59,266
Cause apparently it sounds like you're going to have to do a little bit more research to figure out exactly what we're dealing with.

69
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:00,087
Number one.

70
00:25:00,447 --> 00:25:00,807
Number two,

71
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:15,281
I'm hoping you can also explain to the council a little bit as to whether or not this need for funding is in direct correlation to the extension of the Clippership Connector, or if this is work that would be done regardless of whether or not the Clippership Connector project was in the design stages.

72
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:15,981
Right.

73
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:19,823
So to begin with, the first question about the contamination.

74
00:25:20,804 --> 00:25:26,107
What we found there when we did testing was lead and a small amount of arsenic.

75
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:35,212
So we know that that is there and we know that that is spread at the surface level throughout this area, which is why it's fenced off.

76
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:39,875
When we say surface level, we mean the top eight inches of the dirt.

77
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:44,057
So they take testing in the top eight inches and they consider that to be the surface.

78
00:25:45,518 --> 00:25:47,259
There could be other contaminants there.

79
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,320
We honestly don't know where it's from.

80
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:56,531
There are speculations around the fact that clipper ships used to be built here, and they used lead in that, in the painting of those.

81
00:25:57,792 --> 00:26:10,581
But we don't actually know, and part of this is once you know that there's some contamination, in order to design an appropriate remediation plan, you have to understand the full extent, the depth, what it is.

82
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:17,125
They'll do a full suite of tests for more than just lead at that location to look at the whole area.

83
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:19,725
Your second question was about the clipper ship.

84
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:23,069
So none of this actually had anything to do with the clipper ship connector.

85
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:25,832
Okay.

86
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:28,815
And, um, another question that I have, mr. President, this'll be it for me.

87
00:26:28,975 --> 00:26:35,202
Um, in the area that we're discussing here, was any of this surface level dirt, um, or was this any of this dirt disrupted to make it surface level dirt?

88
00:26:35,222 --> 00:26:38,325
Was there any digging excavation work or anything like that going on there that made this

89
00:26:39,318 --> 00:26:39,518
Right.

90
00:26:39,578 --> 00:26:42,040
So that was contaminated product come up to surface level.

91
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:53,928
That was my first original gut question because we did what's called two test pits in that area where we did dig deeply and we test and we tested that soil in preparation for a different project.

92
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:59,092
We were going to do a green infrastructure project, a project to clean stormwater that we had a grant for.

93
00:26:59,612 --> 00:27:06,037
And so we did dig down to about seven feet and tested and that's where actually we first saw the lead.

94
00:27:06,497 --> 00:27:07,138
And so when,

95
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,763
that occurred, the state said to us, you now need to test this whole area, the whole surface.

96
00:27:13,243 --> 00:27:31,132
So I know that there are two areas about this big, but the practice of the way the test works when they come back and they do surface level is they did a grid of 35 test locations throughout this entire section of the park.

97
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:35,875
And they actively avoided those two spots of turned up dirt

98
00:27:36,285 --> 00:27:40,547
because they knew that that was dirt that had been surfaced by those test pits.

99
00:27:40,968 --> 00:27:45,410
So this is testing from 35 locations throughout this entire section.

100
00:27:46,511 --> 00:27:47,471
Sorry, did you have a second?

101
00:27:48,552 --> 00:27:57,676
So is it safe to say that the state is going to be requiring us to test and remediate this situation regardless of what's going on in the area?

102
00:27:58,077 --> 00:27:58,277
Right.

103
00:27:58,337 --> 00:27:59,357
So that's exactly it.

104
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:04,120
So we were, as soon as we realized that there was lead in those two test pits,

105
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:07,748
We said, we cannot afford, we can't do this green infrastructure here.

106
00:28:07,788 --> 00:28:09,288
It's not a good location for it.

107
00:28:09,908 --> 00:28:11,648
And so we suspended that project.

108
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:17,729
But the state, we actually had to tell them that we had found lead because of the levels.

109
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:24,791
And so they were the ones, the State Department of Environmental Protection, that said, here's where we want you to test.

110
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:26,751
This is the grid we want you to do.

111
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:29,091
This is the area we want you to test.

112
00:28:30,132 --> 00:28:32,612
We gave them the results from the surface level testing.

113
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:35,344
They're the ones who said you must put up a fence.

114
00:28:35,404 --> 00:28:38,464
You must put up a sign that says contamination and keep out.

115
00:28:38,945 --> 00:28:46,687
You must now do this boring, this more extensive looking at the thing.

116
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:55,369
They can spread this work out over many years, but it is our desire to not have a portion of one of our public parks fenced off for many years.

117
00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:59,690
So we would like to move the project forward as quickly as we can.

118
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:09,659
and not wait for it's the end it's part of Riverbend Park and this is this part I do I did bring picture maps in case anybody wasn't sure very helpful

119
00:29:29,555 --> 00:29:35,300
So when you look at this picture and this was up on the city's website, it was went out as a press release.

120
00:29:36,321 --> 00:29:41,806
Um, you can see the river bend yacht club is at one end of the property at ship Ave.

121
00:29:42,827 --> 00:29:44,889
Um, and then this area.

122
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:55,279
So if you were, so for people who are not looking at this picture, I would tell you that if you were standing at the Andrews school and looking at it and decided to walk down the right side of the school towards the river,

123
00:29:55,692 --> 00:30:03,960
So past its loading dock towards the river down that path, all of this is to the right of that asphalt path, to the right of the soccer fields.

124
00:30:04,521 --> 00:30:08,705
It's got condos there with big white fences.

125
00:30:09,326 --> 00:30:12,509
And so the white fences are essentially the property line.

126
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,673
And then this is the area between those fences and the river.

127
00:30:17,513 --> 00:30:22,614
And it doesn't have any active recreation on it, like no kind of play equipment.

128
00:30:23,174 --> 00:30:29,175
But it is, we've been told by the condo residents that they use it for their children to play back there.

129
00:30:29,655 --> 00:30:43,058
And we know, we've observed huge numbers of people cut through there on bicycles, with dogs, with strollers, off of Ship Ave and into Riverbend Park and vice versa through there.

130
00:30:43,098 --> 00:30:44,278
So you can even in that photo,

131
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:49,953
see like a dirt path, that's been made by people who walk through that area.

132
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:55,897
People from that neighborhood are quite upset that they're not supposed to walk through that right now.

133
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:59,959
So that's part of why we'd like to move it forward quickly.

134
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,902
And if, Mr. President, I could just ask the Director of Public Health, Ms.

135
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:08,164
O'Connor, if she could explain some of the health risks that are associated with this type of contamination.

136
00:31:09,517 --> 00:31:11,978
what her position, what her office's position is relative to the remedy.

137
00:31:11,998 --> 00:31:12,779
Yes, to the right, please.

138
00:31:13,419 --> 00:31:16,361
Mary Ann O'Connor, the Director of the Board of Health for the City of Medford.

139
00:31:16,981 --> 00:31:18,622
Thank you.

140
00:31:18,642 --> 00:31:21,383
So, so lead is naturally occurring, right?

141
00:31:21,664 --> 00:31:25,866
And on most homes that were built before 1980, lead-based paint was used.

142
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:31,389
And lead gas was in the air until the 1980s, so there's exhaust.

143
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:35,911
So, you're going to find in most cities that there is lead contamination.

144
00:31:37,448 --> 00:31:45,754
Children under six are most susceptible, obviously, to lead poisoning, and that's because their brains and the nervous systems are still producing so.

145
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:51,278
But you can get lead poisoning through ingestion and through inhaling.

146
00:31:51,718 --> 00:32:01,085
And again, with children, you know, the fact that they're playing outside in the dirt, then coming in and eating their lunch and not washing their hands and putting their hands in their mouth, that's where the lead becomes ingested.

147
00:32:01,526 --> 00:32:03,327
Now, this particular situation,

148
00:32:04,683 --> 00:32:07,565
There are certain spots that the lead is higher than others.

149
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:17,230
But again, there's variations that contribute to, so the seasonal variations, so when that area is covered with snow, you don't have any worries about being infected by lead.

150
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:23,834
If you have nice grass, which most of the area does have grass, that's another barrier that you don't have to worry about.

151
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:31,178
So really what you're concerned about is bare soil and kids playing in that bare soil and then putting their hands in their mouth and ingesting the lead.

152
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:35,016
Mr. President, may I rest?

153
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:35,636
Thank you very much.

154
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:37,596
Appreciate your help.

155
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,917
Thank you, President Carviello.

156
00:32:41,017 --> 00:32:42,618
Can we just get a breakdown?

157
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:47,859
How will the 49,000 be spent and what exactly is that going towards?

158
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,821
And what are we looking at for, I'm sure we don't know exactly, but for costs down the line?

159
00:32:54,185 --> 00:32:56,606
So I sort of thought you were going to ask that.

160
00:32:57,606 --> 00:33:00,967
There's several different pieces of it.

161
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:06,149
Some of it actually covers some of the consulting that he's already been doing.

162
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:13,512
So when you find an emergency situation like this, you, your LSP, they're a licensed site professional.

163
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:19,213
So we hire them, but they hold a license like many other professionals do.

164
00:33:19,294 --> 00:33:23,575
So they have to like do the right thing and not what their client necessarily wants them to do.

165
00:33:25,154 --> 00:33:31,199
So they come out and they start helping us with the testing, with the immediate response action.

166
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:38,925
We had some of the testing that has already occurred we've paid for, but then some of this consulting that's going to go into the reporting.

167
00:33:39,305 --> 00:33:41,267
They monitored us putting up the fence.

168
00:33:42,027 --> 00:33:44,750
They've been having communications with DEP.

169
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:51,896
So some of that has already, some of it's happened, but there's, let me get it.

170
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:53,537
How much did we expend so far?

171
00:33:54,024 --> 00:33:55,284
He hasn't actually billed us.

172
00:33:55,424 --> 00:34:02,287
He's basically said, you know, I know that, you know, frankly, if he has to bill us in July for it, he will.

173
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,628
But the preference would be to really get this moving.

174
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:08,929
We don't want to delay this entire project.

175
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:14,651
And so, sorry, I should have had it called up already.

176
00:34:14,671 --> 00:34:16,351
Here we go.

177
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:23,311
I'm afraid to speak to the numbers off the top of my head, even though I know most of them.

178
00:34:24,052 --> 00:34:33,856
There's twelve thousand dollars for the report, the immediate response outcome report that is due at the end of June.

179
00:34:34,377 --> 00:34:41,720
There's four thousand dollars for the consulting that his that goes into doing that report.

180
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,782
Then there is two days of drilling assessment.

181
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:53,779
all the labor, laboratory analysis, equipment, groundwater sampling, and well survey, and that's $27,000 and change.

182
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,143
There's an IRA status report that's due August 22nd.

183
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:01,285
So there's an immediate report that's due at the end of June.

184
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,548
There's another report that's due at the end of August that's $4,500.

185
00:35:04,628 --> 00:35:05,929
So those two, the 27 and 45 are $31,586.

186
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,531
And then the other,

187
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:20,576
Sorry, what numbers that I don't have in front of me were his original quotes to us.

188
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:30,019
So the 49,000 is really just to figure out what's what we've done so far and to figure out the extent of it once we drill down to the level that we need.

189
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:34,281
Right, this is the characterization of the extent of the problem.

190
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,782
Once we are clear on that,

191
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,671
then we will work on developing a solution.

192
00:35:39,811 --> 00:35:42,612
And everybody wants to know, so what are you going to do about it?

193
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,853
Because that's the natural, I want to know, what are we going to do about it?

194
00:35:46,293 --> 00:35:50,435
And so when I've talked to him about it, there are truly two things you can do with lead.

195
00:35:50,955 --> 00:35:54,357
And that is you can remove it or you can cover it.

196
00:35:56,077 --> 00:36:03,000
If we, you know, if this was a different location and we wanted a paved basketball court, that would be great.

197
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,980
We would pave it.

198
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,561
We would put a nice coating over it.

199
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:06,588
would be wonderful.

200
00:36:06,628 --> 00:36:09,691
We're not doing that next to the river here, unfortunately.

201
00:36:10,731 --> 00:36:23,901
Removing this amount of soil and disposing of it because it's lead-contaminated is probably going to be cost-prohibitive, although we've been talking about some ideas of mixing stuff to make that you could do that.

202
00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:33,468
What we'd really like to do is maybe remove some of it, put down a barrier layer, and then put clean fill on top of it.

203
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:42,985
And actually, we probably have clean fill up at the cemetery that we could use and would be a lovely way to dispose of the excess soil up there.

204
00:36:44,025 --> 00:36:45,866
Whether that's enough or not, we don't know.

205
00:36:47,286 --> 00:36:52,708
But that also has complications that we would need to go to Conservation Commission.

206
00:36:53,328 --> 00:36:57,029
They will need to approve it because it's right next to the river.

207
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,330
This is probably going down to the river's edge.

208
00:36:59,808 --> 00:37:04,569
And then there's people's yards, so you can't just raise the level of the dirt and have water run into their yards.

209
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:09,851
So there would need to be engineering to look at it to figure out what's the best way to do this.

210
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:15,812
But that's kind of what we're hoping, that we'll take some out, we'll cover it, we'll put some clean stuff down.

211
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:29,436
And as you asked about the clipper ship connector, this part, frankly, putting a 10 foot wide path in would be just an area where we wouldn't need as much fill or it would be easier to cover for this section here behind these condos.

212
00:37:30,997 --> 00:37:35,220
But it's not part of the project.

213
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,363
It's my understanding that the design phases of the Clippership connector have not been completed yet.

214
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:40,844
Right.

215
00:37:41,264 --> 00:37:45,107
And there's now an assumption that it's going to go back behind this residence.

216
00:37:45,427 --> 00:37:49,890
So this is perhaps, I should be clear, not one of the areas where it's disputed.

217
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:56,675
If you see the dirt path in the ground there, those residents in general want to know when could we pave a path

218
00:37:57,466 --> 00:38:02,568
Some of them have strong reservations about where the other parts of the path are going to go.

219
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:06,469
They don't feel it's right to disrupt neighborhoods for their neighbors.

220
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:10,671
But they don't actually object to it back here for the most part.

221
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:13,492
There have been a few neighbors who have said they don't understand.

222
00:38:14,052 --> 00:38:19,654
But you can see from that dirt path that people walk through there constantly.

223
00:38:19,854 --> 00:38:22,616
And I've been out there now because of the contamination and the rain.

224
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:26,417
And there are people walking their dogs and biking through there in the rain.

225
00:38:27,025 --> 00:38:29,406
even on the nice, not just the nice days.

226
00:38:30,686 --> 00:38:34,088
So that isn't, I would say it's not in design.

227
00:38:34,108 --> 00:38:41,110
This is part of the location where the intention has always been to connect into Riverbend Park.

228
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:47,052
There is a design meeting on Thursday night at the Andrews School.

229
00:38:47,072 --> 00:38:55,135
So people who have interest or concerns or questions about the Clippership Connector, this Thursday at seven o'clock at the Andrews School,

230
00:38:55,789 --> 00:39:02,791
is a meeting that the DCR is organizing, I will be there and the consultants, the design consultants are going to be there.

231
00:39:03,071 --> 00:39:03,411
Thank you.

232
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:06,352
Councillor Holyday.

233
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:14,055
Can you just explain the 35 test locations, was there lead found at every single one?

234
00:39:14,955 --> 00:39:19,797
Not at every single one but at a liberal distribution of them.

235
00:39:20,097 --> 00:39:23,778
So there was no ability to say, well, it's not at this end, it's not in this corner.

236
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:31,323
They were done in a grid fashion and it seemed fairly random as to where the levels were higher or lower.

237
00:39:31,383 --> 00:39:33,445
There was no clear pattern to it.

238
00:39:34,526 --> 00:39:40,232
Everything in that white, they were distributed throughout that white area.

239
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:41,734
Did we test further down?

240
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,657
We did not test on the other side of the

241
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,071
asphalt sidewalk there, the path.

242
00:39:50,332 --> 00:40:00,157
So outside, so I think that line should be following the asphalt path that goes down between the fields and this area.

243
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:09,042
And so the area from the asphalt path in has been part of testing that occurred when those schools were built.

244
00:40:09,602 --> 00:40:12,924
And there was actually a response action outcome

245
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:22,123
in 1999 that determined it was a small amount of arsenic in that it was not of any kind of concern and it was closed out.

246
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:29,125
So because of that, DEPF did not ask us to test on the other side of that path.

247
00:40:30,006 --> 00:40:34,027
What are the cost estimates for this large piece of property with contamination?

248
00:40:35,848 --> 00:40:37,848
Any of the three options, I guess?

249
00:40:37,928 --> 00:40:42,190
We have not really asked him for cost estimates yet because he keeps saying it's premature.

250
00:40:42,882 --> 00:40:46,983
If we find something else in there, it might change the answers.

251
00:40:48,224 --> 00:40:52,885
Frankly, in order to get cost estimates, you have to do a bunch of engineering and design work, and that costs money.

252
00:40:53,405 --> 00:41:05,929
So he really needs us to say, here's the plan, this is what we want to look at, and then set up a purchase order to pay him to do that kind of engineering and those sorts of estimates.

253
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:07,329
That's not an off-the-cuff number.

254
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:12,989
So we're looking at the 49,000, then cost for engineering and design, and then the fix.

255
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:30,884
I guess my last question then, has there been any discussion to test, I mean, obviously, if there's just a small sidewalk, you would potentially argue that there may be lead or arsenic in the lower section.

256
00:41:30,924 --> 00:41:32,325
Are we gonna- On the other side.

257
00:41:32,385 --> 00:41:33,646
On the other side of the sidewalk.

258
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:38,351
That's right behind the, I'm assuming, I believe this is the school right here.

259
00:41:38,531 --> 00:41:40,012
And so those are the soccer fields, right?

260
00:41:40,052 --> 00:41:42,193
That path runs down along the soccer fields.

261
00:41:42,553 --> 00:41:51,037
So if you also see the soccer fields, for those of you who are familiar with them, are raised up, we understand that clean fill was brought in to that area.

262
00:41:51,577 --> 00:41:53,598
And like I said, they did testing in 1999.

263
00:41:54,158 --> 00:41:58,660
I have to tell you, my heart is always torn in a situation like this.

264
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:03,482
I do not want it to cost the city more money because that's money that can be used for other things.

265
00:42:03,755 --> 00:42:08,858
But I'm the environmental director, and I want us to deal with any problems that are out there.

266
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:13,021
But I'm not really trying to go looking for problems.

267
00:42:13,501 --> 00:42:15,142
It's a tough situation.

268
00:42:16,023 --> 00:42:16,263
So.

269
00:42:17,044 --> 00:42:20,666
Yeah, I mean, you're probably talking to the wrong person with three young kids.

270
00:42:20,766 --> 00:42:25,169
But I would just, through the chair, I mean, I would request that we do some testing.

271
00:42:25,449 --> 00:42:26,350
There's soccer fields.

272
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,951
Kids are there all the time.

273
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:31,573
And it is pretty well grasped, but there

274
00:42:36,407 --> 00:43:03,733
back of the school where I'm not sure if they have recess that some testing and we need because we can't do all this work and then just come to find lead couple in the school and when we could have done it all so some of that so that area the other sidewalk was the limit of work for where they did testing in 1999 copies of those reports where they found a little bit of limited arsenic

275
00:43:04,258 --> 00:43:05,139
and nothing else.

276
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:08,961
And that's where they said it was not enough to be of concern to anybody.

277
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:13,624
And the state at that time closed it off.

278
00:43:13,864 --> 00:43:20,548
Now, I wasn't here at that time, but I have copies of those reports in my office and the maps of where they did that testing.

279
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:31,354
And health, like Councillor Knight asked about the health concerns with arsenic.

280
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:32,555
For children especially.

281
00:43:33,016 --> 00:43:33,216
Yeah.

282
00:43:33,456 --> 00:43:41,442
Well, again, the same concerns about ingesting and the other exposure would have to be over many years.

283
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:46,686
If you're walking on it, it would take many, many years of exposure that way.

284
00:43:46,966 --> 00:43:47,667
And it would do what?

285
00:43:48,327 --> 00:43:49,288
What would the effect be?

286
00:43:55,112 --> 00:44:06,920
Obviously, in 1999, the state determined that the levels that were there were more like background levels and were not an amount that was going to be of risk to anybody.

287
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:12,423
So they have different levels that they have concerns about, depending what the category of use is.

288
00:44:12,883 --> 00:44:14,544
So if it's a backyard, it's one level.

289
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:15,925
If it's a park, it's different.

290
00:44:16,346 --> 00:44:21,669
If it's a school, if it's a parking lot, what's on top of it?

291
00:44:21,689 --> 00:44:24,371
And so they approved it.

292
00:44:25,275 --> 00:44:30,518
That's the other side of the park, the pathway for school and park use.

293
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:40,683
And I will say that some of the same people from the state, um, have been looking at this and helping us to do some of the research.

294
00:44:41,163 --> 00:44:50,448
Um, I am thankful to DEP because some of what you need to do and you would hire your consultant to do is the background research on what is at this location, what's been done here in the past.

295
00:44:50,948 --> 00:44:53,870
And they've actually been doing a bunch of that research for us.

296
00:44:54,323 --> 00:44:59,525
and feeding us the information so that we don't have to pay the consultant as much to do it.

297
00:45:00,205 --> 00:45:00,565
Thank you.

298
00:45:02,185 --> 00:45:08,307
I would just request that we do some test pourings behind the Andrews Middle School as a condition of the paper.

299
00:45:08,327 --> 00:45:09,508
I think it needs to be cleaned up.

300
00:45:09,548 --> 00:45:10,148
We have homes.

301
00:45:10,188 --> 00:45:15,309
We have people living there, going to school there, teaching there.

302
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:18,810
I believe the dog park isn't going to be too far away.

303
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:23,332
I think we need to just, if there's a problem behind that school where kids are playing

304
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:34,666
six months out of the year, I think we need to at least, I don't know how much the test location costs, 35 test locations, but I think we need to figure it all out at once.

305
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:44,171
It's a connected, besides that small pathway, it's a connected piece of green space that I think needs to be handled all at the same time.

306
00:45:44,511 --> 00:45:46,652
And I too, I agree with Ms.

307
00:45:46,672 --> 00:45:52,875
Hunt, we don't want to go looking for problems, but when it comes to thousands of children playing on that field,

308
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:58,892
I think we need to at least investigate a bit.

309
00:45:59,252 --> 00:45:59,613
Thank you.

310
00:46:00,553 --> 00:46:08,957
If I just might, so that you're aware, increase the price related to the borings.

311
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:16,100
I don't have an estimate on that, but it would probably have me requesting additional money.

312
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,363
They had for the two days of the drilling, which is 20 soil borings in this area.

313
00:46:23,305 --> 00:46:31,607
and four soil borings that are groundwater monitoring wells, and then all the tests that go with that and all that work, that was $27,000.

314
00:46:33,008 --> 00:46:47,952
But the 35 test locations, I mean, I'm saying, even if we did 10, you know, five, two rows of five along the pathway, go in 20 feet, I mean, at least we'll know, has it come past that pathway, you know?

315
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,533
Those were the 35, those were the surface testing, so.

316
00:46:51,733 --> 00:46:52,193
That's what I meant.

317
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,789
Those order of $6,000.

318
00:46:57,709 --> 00:46:58,930
For 35.

319
00:46:59,590 --> 00:46:59,930
Yes.

320
00:47:00,231 --> 00:47:02,372
So bring that down by a third.

321
00:47:02,432 --> 00:47:06,053
We're talking 2 grand to maybe test 10, 7 feet.

322
00:47:07,174 --> 00:47:18,860
I would have to confirm with them and get an actual quote, but you're right that the surface level testing is much less expensive, which is why we just did it with money that we had available.

323
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:22,862
And I think $2,000 is money well spent just for peace of mind and for

324
00:47:23,323 --> 00:47:28,325
thousands and thousands of parents that are going to have children.

325
00:47:28,385 --> 00:47:34,188
So 1999, 17 years, do the 10 tests for $2,000 and we have reassurance, but don't do it and you'll never know.

326
00:47:36,189 --> 00:47:36,429
Thank you.

327
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,310
Councilor DelaRusso.

328
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:39,951
President, thank you.

329
00:47:40,011 --> 00:47:47,975
First, I want to congratulate my colleague for expressing concern for the children back there.

330
00:47:48,510 --> 00:48:03,696
And I think that we should follow, quite frankly, I believe we should follow the schema of testing and not scaling back that will allow us to get a proper sample and do proper statistical study of the land back there.

331
00:48:04,297 --> 00:48:06,638
And if we're going to do it, we're going to do it right.

332
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:17,422
Mr. President, the people in this neighborhood have been under considerable duress over the whole issue of this Clippership connector, infringements on their property,

333
00:48:17,815 --> 00:48:27,041
infringements on the security, not having an ample opportunity to discuss and explore questions and not being allowed to speak for themselves.

334
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:34,366
I would rather hear from them about their intentions of pathways and where they go rather than anybody else first.

335
00:48:34,866 --> 00:48:44,052
So therefore they're now faced with additional duress in their living space because they're faced with ancient contaminants that have been there from the days of

336
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:49,911
masted sailing ships that conducted crimes in our community and around the world.

337
00:48:51,232 --> 00:48:57,997
This soil is clearly contaminated, the extent to which we'll learn further once we do further testing.

338
00:48:58,497 --> 00:49:11,287
So to ameliorate and find a plan of action to take care of this poison in the soil and to bring the residents down there to a peace of mind, I support this paper and move approval.

339
00:49:12,088 --> 00:49:12,428
Thank you.

340
00:49:14,124 --> 00:49:15,465
Councilor Scott Pelley.

341
00:49:15,505 --> 00:49:16,365
Thank you, Mr. President.

342
00:49:17,145 --> 00:49:17,906
Just a quick question.

343
00:49:17,926 --> 00:49:26,509
Alicia, you just tell us how we notified our neighbors that what was happening and what were the, what could be the outcomes?

344
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:27,349
How do we do that?

345
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:36,753
So we put together a letter from the mayor's office explaining actually with Mary Ann's contact information,

346
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:43,112
Because we knew that all of their concerns would be health related concerns and I am not Appropriate.

347
00:49:43,252 --> 00:49:45,174
I don't have the background to address the health concerns.

348
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:46,335
That's Marianne's office.

349
00:49:46,795 --> 00:50:04,790
So we put together a letter It was hand delivered to everybody on ship have Every I would have to call up a map to give you the names of the streets but the two streets there that go out to Riverside have and then that side of Riverside have as well and

350
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:08,855
Those letters were hand-delivered by city staff one afternoon.

351
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:16,362
That same afternoon, it was mailed to those addresses as well, because we don't always trust hand-delivering.

352
00:50:17,323 --> 00:50:22,227
The mailing went to the property owners, so anything that was hand-delivered would have

353
00:50:23,126 --> 00:50:25,187
Picked up by whoever is residing there.

354
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:31,089
The mailing was a list from the assessor's office of the property owners in that neighborhood.

355
00:50:31,749 --> 00:50:38,011
And then there was, we have a lot of email addresses because of the Clippership Connector Project.

356
00:50:38,311 --> 00:50:42,513
So every email address we had from that area was emailed that notice as well.

357
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:48,595
And then we sent it out to the press, put it on the city's website, and put out a Facebook about it.

358
00:50:48,974 --> 00:50:51,656
so that people in general would know about it.

359
00:50:52,297 --> 00:50:59,422
Um, we then followed that up with fencing the area off and putting up signs that say danger, soil contamination.

360
00:50:59,442 --> 00:51:00,643
Okay, perfect.

361
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:01,023
Thank you.

362
00:51:01,944 --> 00:51:02,565
I second that.

363
00:51:03,045 --> 00:51:04,526
Mr. President, we'll forward it.

364
00:51:05,447 --> 00:51:06,187
Councilor Marks.

365
00:51:07,168 --> 00:51:08,129
Thank you, Mr. President.

366
00:51:08,449 --> 00:51:17,096
And, uh, it was mentioned earlier that, uh, when we built the schools, the McGlynn and the Andrew school, uh, this city hired an LSP,

367
00:51:18,098 --> 00:51:27,321
back, I think it was in 1999 or maybe even a year prior to that, and they did extensive boring in that entire site.

368
00:51:28,122 --> 00:51:43,607
And to be quite frank, I'm not sure if it includes this little Riverbend Park area here, but I can tell you firsthand that there was extensive boring done, and we knew back 20 years ago that there was contaminants of lead in arsenic.

369
00:51:44,078 --> 00:51:50,361
So this is no surprise, at least to me, that that area is heavily contaminated with lead and arsenic.

370
00:51:50,822 --> 00:51:57,786
And as you mentioned, soil was carted in for, uh, to mitigate rather than dig up because of the expense.

371
00:51:58,386 --> 00:52:05,890
Uh, they had to put down at the top level a certain amount that allowed us to use the ballparks, as you mentioned, the soccer fields and so forth.

372
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:12,854
Um, and what's happening now is anytime we dig or disturb the area, all of a sudden now we're raising up red flags.

373
00:52:13,377 --> 00:52:18,779
So whatever was being done there, you mentioned there was some digging going on for a new project.

374
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:24,240
Maybe if there was some hindsight there saying, you know what, this is an area that we know is contaminated.

375
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,481
The city is high in an LSP.

376
00:52:26,861 --> 00:52:28,222
We know it's in the area.

377
00:52:28,782 --> 00:52:36,204
Maybe before we dig, maybe we should do some due diligence because any digging down there is going to raise a red flag.

378
00:52:36,784 --> 00:52:40,245
And I, in my opinion, we're going to be in the same predicament.

379
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,746
So my question is,

380
00:52:44,442 --> 00:52:48,984
If and when this happens, first of all, how long will it take place?

381
00:52:49,004 --> 00:52:51,425
How long will which?

382
00:52:51,965 --> 00:52:53,806
The act of boring?

383
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:54,586
No, not the boring.

384
00:52:54,966 --> 00:52:55,727
The remediation.

385
00:52:55,967 --> 00:52:57,367
How long will that take place?

386
00:52:57,747 --> 00:53:00,789
It depends how fast the city moves on it.

387
00:53:01,649 --> 00:53:06,771
Honestly, you can drag this out for years if you want to under state law.

388
00:53:07,211 --> 00:53:12,553
Our preference would be to do this testing now in June, have results by early July.

389
00:53:12,996 --> 00:53:24,719
spend July and August figuring out what a good solution is, and then determine is this a solution we can put in place in the fall, what's the financial cost of it, and how long will it take?

390
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:28,320
We would love to take that fence down and have this fixed by the fall.

391
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:41,443
I don't know if we can, but the LSP says to me that that is not an irrational hope, that as long as we keep moving on it and don't drop, you know, we theoretically could, also as long as there's no,

392
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:45,532
other surprises that come up, things that he wasn't anticipating.

393
00:53:45,993 --> 00:53:56,377
There is some concern with when you're right next to the river, how do you properly do things so that you're not completely ruining the ecosystem there?

394
00:53:57,177 --> 00:54:06,081
We have to look at flood levels and riverbanks and heights and not draining water into people's yards because we've now built up a level.

395
00:54:06,521 --> 00:54:09,602
So there's a bunch of things that need to be taken into consideration.

396
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:12,003
I could imagine that we would have

397
00:54:12,513 --> 00:54:23,957
solutions in the fall and then spend the fall having public meetings and debate as to which solution is the best and the right one, identifying money and then not being able to implement the spring.

398
00:54:24,797 --> 00:54:36,041
Mr. President, the reason why I asked that question, and I appreciate your response, is that for those of us that have been behind this real have dealt with the issue in the West Medford parking lot for over three and a half years now.

399
00:54:36,761 --> 00:54:39,962
And we're finally getting to a point where we're going to remediate the area.

400
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:43,003
and a great disruption to the businesses in West Method.

401
00:54:43,463 --> 00:54:48,466
But the reason why I ask is because, as you mentioned, this is a highly traversed area.

402
00:54:49,546 --> 00:54:52,947
And I would hate to see this go on any longer than it has to.

403
00:54:53,608 --> 00:54:58,030
And I, as one member, will approve this, but I'd like to see a time frame.

404
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:03,512
I have to see something in writing that's going to say, we're going to start on this date.

405
00:55:04,232 --> 00:55:05,553
By then, the boring will be done.

406
00:55:05,853 --> 00:55:10,215
We're going to start August 1st with the choosing of a plan.

407
00:55:10,581 --> 00:55:12,562
or sending out a request for proposal for work.

408
00:55:13,122 --> 00:55:27,668
I think we have to see a timeframe before we vote on anything because potentially we could be looking at another West Medford Bargainspot liquor issue that lingers on for three, four, five years in this community, an area that's fenced off saying contaminants.

409
00:55:28,248 --> 00:55:38,292
And as Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned about the neighbors and so forth, about notification, I think it's important that residents not only know what's going on there,

410
00:55:38,736 --> 00:55:40,557
but also have an idea of a timeframe.

411
00:55:41,157 --> 00:55:47,721
So I'm not prepared to vote on this unless you're prepared tonight to at least give us some timeframe of the boring.

412
00:55:48,922 --> 00:55:49,782
What is the process?

413
00:55:49,802 --> 00:55:51,603
I don't have any paperwork in front of me.

414
00:55:51,803 --> 00:55:51,983
Right.

415
00:55:52,043 --> 00:55:53,064
So that's what I asked.

416
00:55:53,084 --> 00:55:56,706
Um, I've been sort of asking what are the different, where are the bottlenecks?

417
00:55:57,306 --> 00:56:02,609
Um, so my first thing is that I would need a purchase order in order for the, um,

418
00:56:03,225 --> 00:56:06,907
consultant to start doing drillings consulting giving me advice.

419
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:30,243
He's willing to just do knowing that we'll make him whole eventually So I asked finance they said if it was approved tonight They could have something cut for me by Friday, which would mean that he could mobilize it during the last two weeks of June He has to schedule it but it will either be next week or the week after that that he could have borings done We have a report that's due June 20th 23rd

420
00:56:31,952 --> 00:56:36,353
That's when we have an IRA plan due to DEP that the consultant will work on.

421
00:56:36,913 --> 00:56:49,777
It's my expectation that if we move at this rate where we are out there in the next two weeks, we will have the results before the 1st of July, and that's when we'll start the planning.

422
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:56,419
How long that planning takes will be dependent on what the results of these tests are.

423
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:01,580
Depending what the tests are will dramatically change that piece of it.

424
00:57:02,243 --> 00:57:11,785
So, so for this first part, I would ask my council colleagues, uh, to put a condition that, uh, the boring and test results be received by this council by July 1st.

425
00:57:12,745 --> 00:57:15,426
That's a date that you just said that seems realistic.

426
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,806
Um, and that way we know the process is going to keep moving.

427
00:57:18,846 --> 00:57:22,107
So I would ask that as a condition, uh, Mr. President.

428
00:57:24,087 --> 00:57:26,668
And also, uh, my last point is,

429
00:57:28,356 --> 00:57:41,621
Recently, the community voted by way of election that we created a Community Preservation Act, and that's for open space, community preservation, and a number of issues.

430
00:57:42,102 --> 00:57:46,324
Could that money be used to work on a project like this?

431
00:57:47,344 --> 00:57:50,325
I would want to check, but I don't think so.

432
00:57:51,226 --> 00:57:56,188
I can't say definitively not, but it's used for improving recreation areas.

433
00:57:56,833 --> 00:58:00,675
And it's used for acquiring land.

434
00:58:01,236 --> 00:58:11,642
And I've never asked, because before now, before this occurred, the brownfield that we had concern about was a West Bedford parking lot.

435
00:58:11,922 --> 00:58:13,383
And I would tell you, no, you can't use it.

436
00:58:13,443 --> 00:58:14,384
That's a parking lot.

437
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:15,644
It's not a recreation area.

438
00:58:16,105 --> 00:58:21,448
So I will say that I have not actually thought to ask whether we would be able to use that money

439
00:58:22,476 --> 00:58:23,856
on something like this?

440
00:58:24,857 --> 00:58:44,941
You can ask, but Mr. President, if we could make that part of also the condition that we receive a report back or response from the city solicitor asking us, asking whether or not we can use Community Preservation Act to pay for this ongoing process of remediation on this particular site.

441
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:48,561
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

442
00:58:49,061 --> 00:58:49,782
Councillor Falcone.

443
00:58:50,242 --> 00:58:51,602
I just had a couple of last questions.

444
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:56,005
Alicia, is all of this property, is this all City of Medford property?

445
00:58:56,025 --> 00:58:57,746
Is any of this property owned by DCR?

446
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:16,877
Well, I was actually... So, in fact, when we started this project, we were under the impression it was all City of Medford, and it turns out that there is an amount near the Yacht Club, so we thought the border was the line between the gravel and the grass.

447
00:59:17,543 --> 00:59:20,625
I've actually now had it flagged where the property line is.

448
00:59:20,665 --> 00:59:27,050
So I had a surveyor out there this week, last week, last week to mark where the property line is.

449
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:34,776
So it's about 100 feet in from the Riverside Yacht Club into the park where the DEP property is.

450
00:59:35,256 --> 00:59:38,118
So we've been in DEP, sorry, DCR.

451
00:59:38,619 --> 00:59:47,265
So we have been talking with DCR about their property ownership of that 100 feet there and how they wanna handle that piece of it.

452
00:59:47,719 --> 00:59:52,921
We will not be doing any of our borings past that property line.

453
00:59:52,961 --> 00:59:54,342
That's why we had it marked.

454
00:59:55,302 --> 00:59:58,283
And we're trying to coordinate with DCR that last 100 feet.

455
00:59:58,443 --> 01:00:01,364
So DCR will hopefully eventually do borings in that area?

456
01:00:02,545 --> 01:00:07,127
I'm certain that the state DEP will require them to, just like they're requiring us to.

457
01:00:07,147 --> 01:00:07,787
OK.

458
01:00:09,175 --> 01:00:13,117
As far as, you mentioned there are two reports, one in June and one in August?

459
01:00:13,317 --> 01:00:13,538
Yes.

460
01:00:14,138 --> 01:00:16,179
Can we receive copies of both of those when they are?

461
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:18,060
I'm happy to do that.

462
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:23,663
For the record, they are public reports, so we will submit them to state DEP.

463
01:00:24,143 --> 01:00:26,744
DEP reviews them, and then they put them on their website.

464
01:00:26,764 --> 01:00:27,925
They're available for everybody.

465
01:00:28,886 --> 01:00:31,207
The city is also perfectly welcome.

466
01:00:31,247 --> 01:00:33,988
We can send it to you guys and post them on the city's website as well.

467
01:00:34,028 --> 01:00:37,030
If you could send us copies, I'd greatly appreciate it, and just be good to

468
01:00:37,706 --> 01:00:38,907
read those as soon as we get them.

469
01:00:39,007 --> 01:00:49,014
There's a lot of residents that live in that area, so it would be ideal to see what exactly, we know what the concerns are, but to see how bad it is and what's eventually going to be done.

470
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:52,097
And I do just want to warn you, I don't write those reports.

471
01:00:52,117 --> 01:00:54,258
The licensee professional does.

472
01:00:54,478 --> 01:00:57,581
When I've read others of these reports, they're kind of heavy.

473
01:00:57,681 --> 01:01:01,364
They're kind of heavy in the technical terms.

474
01:01:02,449 --> 01:01:04,170
They're not written for the general public.

475
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:08,754
They're written for the state agency that monitors this stuff.

476
01:01:09,094 --> 01:01:10,755
So, but yeah, we're happy to share them.

477
01:01:11,436 --> 01:01:12,897
Just following on the topic.

478
01:01:12,957 --> 01:01:20,923
So when we had the committee, the whole meeting regarding the Clippership Connector a couple of months ago, I believe they talked about the other side of the river as well.

479
01:01:23,045 --> 01:01:23,245
Right.

480
01:01:23,785 --> 01:01:24,006
Right.

481
01:01:24,026 --> 01:01:24,966
93 side of the river.

482
01:01:25,106 --> 01:01:26,427
Is that DCR property?

483
01:01:26,467 --> 01:01:28,729
That is DCR property over there.

484
01:01:28,749 --> 01:01:31,431
The whole other side of the river between 93 and the river.

485
01:01:32,757 --> 01:01:35,299
Do we know if there are any plans for the DCR to test that side?

486
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:36,739
No.

487
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:44,724
Usually people don't start testing soil until you're going to remove it and move it out of the way, and that's what triggers somebody.

488
01:01:45,524 --> 01:01:51,868
So when you move soil and you're getting rid of it, you can't just move it unless you know that it's clean.

489
01:01:52,328 --> 01:01:55,790
So if you're going to dispose of it somewhere, you have to test it.

490
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:57,151
You have to do a characterization.

491
01:01:58,412 --> 01:02:00,993
So usually you don't unless you have a reason to test it.

492
01:02:01,309 --> 01:02:09,251
The reason why I ask is because that night I think they did talk about putting a lane of, you know, a trail that went on that side of the river as well.

493
01:02:09,931 --> 01:02:16,893
I'm not sure if that's going to come before or after the Clippership Connector, but I would think that would be a concern as well that needs to be addressed.

494
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:23,734
And I would have to refer that to DCR and what they would choose to do on their property.

495
01:02:24,534 --> 01:02:30,556
The agency that would oversee that contamination, et cetera, is the State Department of Environmental

496
01:02:32,168 --> 01:02:39,691
And while I'm the environmental director in Medford, I don't actually have oversight over that, and I can't tell the state agency to go test.

497
01:02:40,071 --> 01:02:42,152
It would be the other state agency that would tell them.

498
01:02:42,312 --> 01:02:49,535
And I understand that, but I think if they're going to run, because they made it sound like that during the meeting, they were going to run that path down that side.

499
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:52,916
They would also like to investigate that path.

500
01:02:52,956 --> 01:02:56,718
They would also like to consider designing on that side as well.

501
01:02:57,253 --> 01:02:58,773
that is not currently funded.

502
01:02:58,873 --> 01:03:01,254
It's not currently a project in process.

503
01:03:05,054 --> 01:03:05,374
That's it.

504
01:03:05,474 --> 01:03:05,795
Thank you.

505
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:07,935
Council Member Kern.

506
01:03:08,235 --> 01:03:09,035
One last question.

507
01:03:09,075 --> 01:03:10,635
Thank you, Vice President Marks.

508
01:03:11,396 --> 01:03:25,318
With regards to the many, many condos that are on the other side of this white line, I see that a lot of it's paved and obviously built on, but has there been any concerns from the property owners that this led

509
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,101
on their property and underneath their property?

510
01:03:28,301 --> 01:03:32,765
This state has been in touch with them and has been talking to them directly.

511
01:03:32,785 --> 01:03:38,909
I have not been a party to those conversations, but I was told they were contacting the Condo Association.

512
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:50,797
They have actually groundwater contamination under those condos that they have been dealing with, and they have a licensed site professional engaged because of that.

513
01:03:51,702 --> 01:04:07,013
So I know that the state told, well, the state told me that they were going to speak to the Condo Owners Association and to that LSP about the lead, but I don't know what he actually said or what their plans are.

514
01:04:07,273 --> 01:04:10,795
So the groundwater contamination that they have is mostly likely lead?

515
01:04:10,815 --> 01:04:12,176
It's completely unrelated.

516
01:04:12,296 --> 01:04:14,318
Oh, completely unrelated.

517
01:04:14,338 --> 01:04:16,259
It is completely unrelated.

518
01:04:16,819 --> 01:04:17,780
I think it's hydrocorps.

519
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:18,641
Do you remember?

520
01:04:19,724 --> 01:04:21,945
It's, yeah, it's a completely different contamination.

521
01:04:21,965 --> 01:04:23,626
And we were, frankly, we were shocked.

522
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:30,150
We thought that when we dug right next, the first test pit, that we were going to see their contamination.

523
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:32,651
If anything, we didn't.

524
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:33,691
We saw this other thing.

525
01:04:33,711 --> 01:04:34,392
Completely different.

526
01:04:34,672 --> 01:04:42,536
And that was because all of the test borings that were done in 1999 and before then, or through that project, were on the other side.

527
01:04:42,636 --> 01:04:47,719
I have all of those reports in my office, and there was nothing done on this side of the pathway.

528
01:04:48,496 --> 01:05:00,739
And honestly, I know people keep telling me that we know there was lead there, but the actual report sitting in my desk doesn't say that there was lead there on the rest of the property.

529
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,580
So it's perplexing.

530
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:06,521
This is not the first time I've had people say that by far.

531
01:05:07,961 --> 01:05:13,883
I move approval of the paper as well or second it with those two or three conditions.

532
01:05:15,323 --> 01:05:24,666
And make sure we have a report back from the mayor's office stating that she's going to give the extra $2,000 to do 10 additional test porings, seven feet deep.

533
01:05:24,746 --> 01:05:25,026
Thank you.

534
01:05:26,447 --> 01:05:27,687
Councillor Neistat.

535
01:05:27,707 --> 01:05:28,848
Mr. President, thank you very much.

536
01:05:28,868 --> 01:05:32,869
I, too, feel as though this is an appropriate paper to approve this evening.

537
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,630
I feel as though it's a good use of free cash.

538
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:39,091
Ultimately, it's an unforeseen situation that does require immediate action.

539
01:05:39,611 --> 01:05:41,752
I think that the residents of the neighbourhood deserve it.

540
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:50,122
We have a reoccurring theme in our community here that the residents want to see us tap into one of the most underutilized resources that we have here in Medford, which is our river.

541
01:05:51,023 --> 01:06:09,352
That, coupled with the fact that the residents along Ship Avenue that are abutting this property are going to see a drastic impact on their quality of life and their property value, the longer that this fence stays up that says contamination would lead me to believe that it's a good vote this evening to take to approve the $49,000 for riverbed contamination LSP services, Mr. President.

542
01:06:09,769 --> 01:06:11,630
As such, I would support the amendments as well.

543
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:12,510
Move approval of the question.

544
01:06:13,151 --> 01:06:14,091
Thank you, Councillor.

545
01:06:15,112 --> 01:06:15,452
Thank you.

546
01:06:15,492 --> 01:06:17,173
We have a gentleman that would like to speak.

547
01:06:20,695 --> 01:06:21,835
Name and address of the record, please.

548
01:06:23,856 --> 01:06:26,398
Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street Method Mass.

549
01:06:27,438 --> 01:06:38,984
I'm very dismayed all of a sudden we may have a dirty 21E at this riverside after 200 to 300 years of the area being a dumping site.

550
01:06:40,407 --> 01:06:49,992
And if there is a problem, although is this not the DCR State of Massachusetts problem and their cost to clean up?

551
01:06:52,173 --> 01:07:04,320
Believe in that in the 1677 law, Massachusetts had said, we the people have rights of 20 feet above mean high tide along all waterways.

552
01:07:06,932 --> 01:07:07,432
P.S.

553
01:07:08,013 --> 01:07:15,720
I, we have been fishing and my son and many of my neighbors and biking there for over 50 years.

554
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:31,795
I'm further dismayed being on the eve of finally getting our East Medford connect the bike path, the missing link, which happens to be the center of the city, mind you, connecting West to assembly road.

555
01:07:35,952 --> 01:07:48,461
Also, we had already built bike paths behind adjacent and adjoining that possible dirty 21E area behind the new schools, the McGlynn and the Andrews.

556
01:07:53,604 --> 01:08:01,730
And it's sad, coincidentally, when we're finally having a Thursday meeting to hopefully finalize and connect the middle path.

557
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:10,734
that we have this situation that I've noticed the fences and I couldn't negotiate with my bicycle for the last couple of weeks.

558
01:08:13,116 --> 01:08:15,457
Please, let's try to make some sense of this.

559
01:08:15,777 --> 01:08:16,138
Thank you.

560
01:08:16,478 --> 01:08:20,480
And hopefully this year and not in 10 years.

561
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:21,401
Thank you.

562
01:08:23,782 --> 01:08:25,083
Name and address the record, please.

563
01:08:25,423 --> 01:08:27,064
Hi, Gina's 35 Paris street.

564
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,686
If I may, through the chair, just a question on clarification.

565
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:31,387
Uh, when, um,

566
01:08:32,093 --> 01:08:35,235
Alicia was going over the details of the boardings that were going to happen.

567
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:50,466
I believe she indicated there were four that were going to go down to groundwater level, and I'm just curious if we're testing that groundwater at the same time, and if so, what type of additional implications could that open up for that same area?

568
01:08:50,886 --> 01:08:51,126
Thanks.

569
01:08:55,032 --> 01:08:58,233
So basically there are different kinds of contamination.

570
01:08:58,254 --> 01:09:01,055
Some are soil contaminations and some are groundwater contaminations.

571
01:09:22,058 --> 01:09:28,785
And so we need to test the groundwater because we need to test for everything per the state DEP.

572
01:09:29,405 --> 01:09:33,949
And so if you find contamination in groundwater, then the question is, what is it?

573
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:34,890
How is it?

574
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:35,651
Is it coming out?

575
01:09:35,711 --> 01:09:37,253
Is it getting out into the air?

576
01:09:37,313 --> 01:09:37,753
How is it?

577
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:40,976
Like, that's one of those things that could change.

578
01:09:41,457 --> 01:09:44,840
You know, when I say, oh, we could dig up the soil and put new soil on top,

579
01:09:45,273 --> 01:09:57,039
But then if we find groundwater contamination, that could change totally what we're doing and totally what the solution is, which is why I hesitate to say this is what our solution is and this is how long we're going to take.

580
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:59,341
My hope is that we don't find anything.

581
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:07,225
If we find stuff in the groundwater that's related to what's actually being treated for under those condos, then that would be connected.

582
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:10,466
And that's actually being paid for by an insurance company.

583
01:10:11,652 --> 01:10:20,095
from the person, the company that insured the construction of those condos originally is paying for that current work that's going on.

584
01:10:20,435 --> 01:10:23,656
So if we found the same contaminant, it would be linked and become part of that.

585
01:10:24,277 --> 01:10:25,377
It could get complicated.

586
01:10:25,857 --> 01:10:26,938
I'm hoping that it doesn't.

587
01:10:27,658 --> 01:10:35,881
We can all do what we do to hope that we don't find contamination and that this is just the lead is the only thing there.

588
01:10:35,901 --> 01:10:37,101
Thank you.

589
01:10:37,301 --> 01:10:38,722
The question.

590
01:10:40,545 --> 01:10:53,069
Offered by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli, as amended by Councilor Mox, Councilor Lungo-Kern, and Councilor Mox again.

591
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:54,929
All those in favor?

592
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:57,170
All those in favor?

593
01:10:58,951 --> 01:11:00,251
Roll call has been requested.

594
01:11:01,972 --> 01:11:04,292
Certified precaution, we do need a roll call vote.

595
01:11:04,632 --> 01:11:06,633
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

596
01:11:07,792 --> 01:11:08,673
Councilor DelaRusso?

597
01:11:08,793 --> 01:11:09,013
Yes.

598
01:11:09,593 --> 01:11:10,333
Councilor Falcone?

599
01:11:10,434 --> 01:11:10,634
Yes.

600
01:11:11,154 --> 01:11:11,694
Councilor Night?

601
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:12,054
Yes.

602
01:11:12,495 --> 01:11:13,275
Councilor Kern?

603
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:13,515
Yes.

604
01:11:14,056 --> 01:11:14,816
Vice-President Mox?

605
01:11:15,096 --> 01:11:15,376
Yes.

606
01:11:15,957 --> 01:11:16,697
Councilor Scarpelli?

607
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:17,077
Yes.

608
01:11:17,097 --> 01:11:18,278
Vice-President Caviello?

609
01:11:18,538 --> 01:11:18,818
Yes.

610
01:11:19,619 --> 01:11:22,140
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

611
01:11:22,621 --> 01:11:23,821
Motion passes.

612
01:11:25,122 --> 01:11:29,264
All right, Councilor Scarpelli, while we're on suspension.

613
01:11:36,822 --> 01:11:49,967
17 5 1 1 petition by Robert Moore for Clematis Avenue method mass to address the council about a business being run out of a residential neighborhood home.

614
01:11:52,287 --> 01:11:54,248
Mr. Moore, if you would have, please.

615
01:11:57,789 --> 01:11:58,129
Thank you.

616
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:05,472
There is a business being run of one Clematis road for the landscaping, a landscaping company,

617
01:12:06,312 --> 01:12:08,774
They named it Perez Landscaping.

618
01:12:09,475 --> 01:12:11,516
September through fall, it is landscaping.

619
01:12:11,576 --> 01:12:12,737
Winter, there's snow removal.

620
01:12:13,998 --> 01:12:18,882
In the year-round, scrap metal retrieval, cutting up metal, what have you, on-site.

621
01:12:21,324 --> 01:12:24,847
Originally, it was just small push mowers, leaf blowers, stuff like that.

622
01:12:25,027 --> 01:12:26,028
Now they have heavy equipment.

623
01:12:26,228 --> 01:12:31,993
Blobcat, grass cutting tractor, wood chipper, which they use on-site.

624
01:12:35,238 --> 01:12:41,343
a trailer to haul back and forth, a two and a half ton truck to pull the trailer.

625
01:12:42,745 --> 01:12:44,566
The residential area is not zoned for business.

626
01:12:47,108 --> 01:12:47,829
I'd like it stopped.

627
01:12:51,032 --> 01:12:53,794
Mr. President, Councillor Scarpelli.

628
01:12:54,395 --> 01:12:55,255
Thank you, Mr. President.

629
01:12:55,355 --> 01:13:00,260
I know that I went out and visited the site and I talked to Mr. Moore and there

630
01:13:03,395 --> 01:13:19,879
Uh, there is equipment and if we can, um, I'd like to ask, uh, Mr. Mavuso, uh, to give us a report back and what the history has been and what is being done moving forward to make sure that, uh, this is being investigated properly.

631
01:13:19,939 --> 01:13:29,362
So the neighbors in that area aren't, uh, being woken up at five o'clock in the morning due to, uh, heavy trucking and beeping and, um,

632
01:13:30,469 --> 01:13:35,593
stump grinding during the weeknights and weekends and so on and so forth.

633
01:13:36,513 --> 01:13:41,056
Like I said, I know I've been out there, Mr. Barreto and Mr. Moore, and I've seen the house.

634
01:13:41,457 --> 01:13:49,462
I've tried to talk to the person and if we can just get a report back from Mr. I believe he has, and I believe he's already issued tickets.

635
01:13:49,542 --> 01:13:59,409
So if we could just get an update and, and if we can ask for a plan moving forward to make sure that the, those residents aren't being affected in such a negative way.

636
01:13:59,738 --> 01:14:00,198
So thank you.

637
01:14:00,258 --> 01:14:00,599
Thank you.

638
01:14:01,019 --> 01:14:03,401
Sorry, just pass my border.

639
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:05,002
Let's not have building the structure in the ad.

640
01:14:06,503 --> 01:14:07,143
For what purpose?

641
01:14:07,183 --> 01:14:07,583
I don't know.

642
01:14:07,704 --> 01:14:08,124
Storage.

643
01:14:08,804 --> 01:14:09,445
They got a permit.

644
01:14:09,505 --> 01:14:09,905
I doubt it.

645
01:14:11,646 --> 01:14:11,886
Cool.

646
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:14,308
I have pictures of that from another neighbor that took them.

647
01:14:15,249 --> 01:14:17,510
I did forward those pictures to Paul Mookie.

648
01:14:17,871 --> 01:14:23,414
I don't know if he passed them on to you or not, but we do not have, you can have these if you'd like.

649
01:14:24,075 --> 01:14:24,195
Yeah.

650
01:14:31,065 --> 01:14:31,525
Councilor Knight.

651
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:33,528
Mr. President, thank you very much.

652
01:14:33,568 --> 01:14:35,189
And Mr. Moore, thank you for coming here this evening.

653
01:14:35,229 --> 01:14:35,850
I appreciate it.

654
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:38,753
And I can certainly understand your frustration.

655
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:45,160
I, too, grew up in a home that lived next door to a person that ran a junkyard out of his backyard.

656
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,963
And my next door neighbor on the other side parked an 18-wheeler in his driveway every night.

657
01:14:48,983 --> 01:14:53,388
So I can certainly understand the impact that it's having on your quiet enjoyment and peace in your neighborhood.

658
01:14:53,925 --> 01:14:59,329
Um, in addition to referring this matter to the code enforcement officers suggested by councilor Scott Pelley, I'd also like to amend the paper.

659
01:14:59,369 --> 01:15:03,212
Mr. President requests that the board of health go out and do an examination out there.

660
01:15:03,252 --> 01:15:07,815
If the gentleman is in fact collecting junk and debris, then there may be border health issues that are coming along with that as well.

661
01:15:08,195 --> 01:15:16,641
So I'd like to ask the missile corner, uh, someone, everyone inspectors out there to take a look and make sure that they're in compliance with all, um, border health regulations that are in place as well.

662
01:15:17,141 --> 01:15:17,461
Thank you.

663
01:15:17,501 --> 01:15:19,523
Councilor vice president marks.

664
01:15:20,175 --> 01:15:21,136
Thank you, Mr. President.

665
01:15:21,456 --> 01:15:24,817
We also have a clean it or lean it ordinance.

666
01:15:25,558 --> 01:15:31,581
And if there is debris or building materials or anything in that yard, we can enforce the clean it or lean it.

667
01:15:31,641 --> 01:15:40,725
So I think the appropriate avenue is for the building commissioner and the building inspector to go out there and code enforcement officer and check out what's going on the property.

668
01:15:41,046 --> 01:15:49,850
And they'll deem whether or not there's sufficient facts to prove that there's a business being run out of that location and then be able to find them accordingly.

669
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,581
And if that doesn't work, you can end up taking them to court.

670
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:55,482
So there's, there's a number of avenues that they can do.

671
01:15:56,242 --> 01:15:58,243
Um, and that really is the first step.

672
01:15:58,984 --> 01:16:01,244
So, uh, I mean, we're the taxpayers.

673
01:16:01,445 --> 01:16:02,365
I only rent the property.

674
01:16:02,385 --> 01:16:04,646
It's an absentee landlord, right?

675
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:05,806
We could go after the property.

676
01:16:06,226 --> 01:16:06,707
Absolutely.

677
01:16:07,687 --> 01:16:08,267
I agree with you.

678
01:16:08,627 --> 01:16:11,889
I'm just saying the building department is really the enforcing authority.

679
01:16:12,749 --> 01:16:17,511
You know, police department can't come and go off the air building department that would enforce that.

680
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:21,488
And they've been successful in the past on other properties in the community.

681
01:16:21,548 --> 01:16:24,188
So, uh, they'll get our message loud and clear.

682
01:16:24,568 --> 01:16:24,848
Thank you.

683
01:16:25,068 --> 01:16:27,889
Thank you, miss.

684
01:16:27,929 --> 01:16:28,889
Motion for approval.

685
01:16:28,949 --> 01:16:32,210
Mr. President, we have another, we have another gentleman to speak.

686
01:16:34,110 --> 01:16:39,451
Name and address for the record, please spread a one or two Harrison street, uh, up in the Heights.

687
01:16:40,051 --> 01:16:41,972
I'm talking about the same problem we have here.

688
01:16:42,512 --> 01:16:45,313
They moved into our neighborhood probably about four or five years ago.

689
01:16:46,013 --> 01:16:47,133
It started out with chickens.

690
01:16:48,397 --> 01:16:51,838
I get pictures here, chickens in my yard, chickens in the streets.

691
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:57,761
They brought refrigerators, stoves, hot water heaters.

692
01:16:58,581 --> 01:17:01,442
The cold enforcement come up, they got them to get rid of all that crap.

693
01:17:02,323 --> 01:17:05,104
Then they started with wood chippers.

694
01:17:06,344 --> 01:17:13,387
We had trees that they cut down, they bring them home, they run them through the big chipper into the truck.

695
01:17:14,648 --> 01:17:16,569
And we tell them, you can't do that stuff.

696
01:17:16,949 --> 01:17:17,689
They're foreign people.

697
01:17:17,749 --> 01:17:18,969
I got nothing against anybody.

698
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:20,910
I got nothing against the family.

699
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,571
Just this is a residential area.

700
01:17:23,631 --> 01:17:27,572
I've been up there 74 years, never had any problems.

701
01:17:28,332 --> 01:17:29,393
Now we get this problem.

702
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:31,013
You got these trucks coming in.

703
01:17:31,053 --> 01:17:32,734
My daughter works on Friday night late.

704
01:17:33,374 --> 01:17:35,815
She tries to come up the street, which is I'm on a dead end.

705
01:17:36,963 --> 01:17:39,884
The trucks, they're trying to get them in the yard, put a bobcat in the yard.

706
01:17:39,944 --> 01:17:45,286
It took her one half hour to get up the street, and I'm only one house away from my house.

707
01:17:46,467 --> 01:17:52,829
And I'd appreciate it if you people would do something about this because we've gone to the commission downstairs, the building department.

708
01:17:53,209 --> 01:17:55,230
I've gone to the mayor's office three times.

709
01:17:55,290 --> 01:17:57,811
They said they were going to handle it, and we still have the problem.

710
01:17:58,511 --> 01:17:59,151
Now we're here.

711
01:17:59,251 --> 01:18:00,752
We hope this is our last stop.

712
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:02,853
I don't want to have to go to any court.

713
01:18:03,812 --> 01:18:14,219
The owner, he allowed them to bring rubbish from his property up in Woburn, Winchester, one or the other, and dump it behind car park, because it backs up car park.

714
01:18:14,879 --> 01:18:16,100
We're told you can't do that.

715
01:18:17,121 --> 01:18:20,803
The kid that lives in the house says he said it was OK to do that.

716
01:18:21,504 --> 01:18:24,646
So now every once in a while, they slip some rubbish in there, which is leaves.

717
01:18:25,146 --> 01:18:30,490
I've had fires behind my house, almost come down to my house throughout the years I've been there.

718
01:18:31,408 --> 01:18:34,669
If they keep putting all these leaves back there, they're gonna take me else.

719
01:18:35,509 --> 01:18:36,810
So I appreciate you can take care of it.

720
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:37,170
Thank you.

721
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:37,550
Thank you.

722
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:48,254
On the motion by Councilor Scott Kelly that we inform the building inspector and the health inspector to go down and check the property out.

723
01:18:48,674 --> 01:18:50,635
Seconded by Vice President Mox.

724
01:18:51,615 --> 01:18:52,375
All those in favor?

725
01:18:52,695 --> 01:18:53,195
Aye.

726
01:18:53,596 --> 01:18:54,556
Motion passes.

727
01:18:55,056 --> 01:19:00,678
While we're in suspension, I just want to acknowledge that today,

728
01:19:09,916 --> 01:19:10,237
Thank you.

729
01:19:10,717 --> 01:19:12,498
Mr. Thank you.

730
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:13,559
Thank you.

731
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:23,306
On the motion by council Scott Pelley, do we have something on the motion by councilor night to take another paper out of order?

732
01:19:23,326 --> 01:19:24,067
Which paper would that be?

733
01:19:24,107 --> 01:19:24,687
Councilor?

734
01:19:25,308 --> 01:19:27,229
Huh?

735
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:30,451
One seven five zero four.

736
01:19:31,472 --> 01:19:32,973
Uh, council vice president marks.

737
01:19:33,013 --> 01:19:34,014
If you could read this, please.

738
01:19:38,215 --> 01:19:53,063
Mr. Vice President?

739
01:19:53,083 --> 01:19:53,463
Yeah.

740
01:19:53,523 --> 01:19:55,944
Paper 17-504 offered by President Caviello.

741
01:19:56,364 --> 01:20:02,888
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council discuss the problems caused by construction on Boston Ave to Harvard Street.

742
01:20:03,448 --> 01:20:04,569
Council President Caviello.

743
01:20:05,269 --> 01:20:06,210
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

744
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:06,830
Mr. Vice President,

745
01:20:08,501 --> 01:20:17,868
From Harvard Street all the way up to Boston Avenue into Ball Square, for the past three to four years, there's been constant construction going over there.

746
01:20:18,328 --> 01:20:23,592
And there's, from digging the streets up to blocking the streets.

747
01:20:24,173 --> 01:20:34,241
And there are many businesses that are on that street that have suffered greatly with their business because of street closures for extended periods of time.

748
01:20:34,781 --> 01:20:36,002
And a lot of the times they were done

749
01:20:36,527 --> 01:20:38,547
with no notification to the businesses.

750
01:20:39,288 --> 01:20:46,829
And I know that some of the businesses have reached out to the developers, and they seem to not have been any help.

751
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:50,790
I mean, as soon as one project stopped there, another one started right up.

752
01:20:51,430 --> 01:21:03,233
So I think it's about time that these half a dozen businesses and the homes that are there receive some kind of break for all the disruption they've been going through for the last three years.

753
01:21:04,197 --> 01:21:06,878
and the city doesn't seem to be, uh, doing anything about it.

754
01:21:08,338 --> 01:21:16,601
So what I would ask that, uh, the engineer, the city engineer again, step in and give us some kind of timeframe and, uh, to let us know what's happening with the project.

755
01:21:16,621 --> 01:21:19,362
Um, and how, how much longer they're going to be there.

756
01:21:20,762 --> 01:21:20,902
Yeah.

757
01:21:21,442 --> 01:21:22,263
Thank you, Mr. President.

758
01:21:22,283 --> 01:21:22,863
Councilor Knight.

759
01:21:23,643 --> 01:21:25,104
Um, Mr. President, thank you very much.

760
01:21:25,124 --> 01:21:27,885
And I'd like to thank councilor Caviello for putting this resolution forward.

761
01:21:28,465 --> 01:21:32,506
Um, I too, over the weekend had the opportunity to meet with a couple of business owners that, uh,

762
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:39,866
operate on Harvard Avenue, and there's a situation where it's not just one development that's going on.

763
01:21:39,886 --> 01:21:47,913
We have the development at 640 Boston Avenue being performed by 640 Boston Avenue LLC, and that's a 43-unit development housing.

764
01:21:48,474 --> 01:21:55,460
And I spoke with the general manager of the construction company yesterday, and that project is going to be wrapping up around July 1st.

765
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:58,183
So the construction is going to be complete, and people will be moving in July 1st.

766
01:21:59,137 --> 01:22:01,838
With that being said, Mr. President, that's not the only issue in the neighborhood.

767
01:22:01,858 --> 01:22:09,941
We've seen the MBTA perform an extended amount of work on the train tracks in preparation for the Greenland extension that's impacted this business.

768
01:22:10,621 --> 01:22:16,624
Now we've seen Tufts University go in and do some work up on the top of Boston Ave that's also impacted this business.

769
01:22:17,004 --> 01:22:23,966
And now we're seeing RX Devereux doing some public utility work on the Somerville side that's disrupting this business.

770
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:25,347
So if you wanted to get to

771
01:22:26,681 --> 01:22:40,785
the stretch of Boston Avenue between Ball Square and Harvard Street, and you were coming from Somerville, the only way that you'd be able to go would be to go up past Tufts University, all the way up to the library, then turn around down Boston Avenue and come back down Boston Avenue.

772
01:22:40,825 --> 01:22:47,488
So in essence, the traffic constraints that are in place right now are detouring people directly out of the entire region, Mr. President.

773
01:22:47,508 --> 01:22:50,008
We're just having an impact on the businesses down there.

774
01:22:50,308 --> 01:22:55,410
So I think it's also pertinent that we receive copies of the traffic management plans.

775
01:22:55,867 --> 01:23:04,530
from 640 Boston Avenue, as well as Irak Stavro, who's performing the utility work on Harvard Street on the Somerville side, Mr. President, in front of St.

776
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:05,170
Clement's Church.

777
01:23:05,790 --> 01:23:09,431
It's my understanding that Tufts University, at this point in time, has ceased their construction.

778
01:23:09,471 --> 01:23:10,412
That project is complete.

779
01:23:10,912 --> 01:23:14,013
And the finishing touches that are being put on are striping and signage.

780
01:23:14,953 --> 01:23:22,135
And I also am under the impression, Mr. President, that in the near future, the MBTA will be back out in the area performing some work.

781
01:23:22,275 --> 01:23:24,016
They're going to be doing some land takings, et cetera.

782
01:23:24,392 --> 01:23:27,853
So I'd also like to ask that the MBTA provide us with their traffic management plan.

783
01:23:28,533 --> 01:23:41,697
Once we receive those documents, we can forward them to our division of engineering and ask our division of engineering to review the traffic management plans and come up with recommendations to create a better flow of traffic that will have a less adverse impact on the businesses that are in operation on that stretch of land.

784
01:23:44,298 --> 01:23:44,978
Thank you, councilor.

785
01:23:44,998 --> 01:23:46,599
Councilor Scott Pelley.

786
01:23:46,779 --> 01:23:48,099
Thank you, Mr. Vice president.

787
01:23:48,799 --> 01:23:51,940
I too went out in the site, talked to a few of the neighbors.

788
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,041
I think if we can have,

789
01:23:55,112 --> 01:24:04,156
from beginning to end of Boston Ave that constituents get an update on when the jobs or work being performed is being done.

790
01:24:04,176 --> 01:24:17,241
I had a call and I talked to one of our friends that told us that they have to get up and leave an hour and a half early before the construction starts because

791
01:24:18,237 --> 01:24:24,820
the, if the construction starts walk before they leave, depending what time they come in, they're stuck in the driveway.

792
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:35,124
So, and they're not getting much help or assistance or information from, uh, those, those developers or, um, the contractor.

793
01:24:35,164 --> 01:24:48,010
So if we can reach out to, um, uh, uh, engineering and see who's doing the work to inform our, uh, constituents on Devereux and Boston Ave all the way up and down,

794
01:24:48,625 --> 01:24:56,592
make and have a defined start time and end time to make their lives a little bit easier.

795
01:24:56,992 --> 01:24:58,133
It'd be greatly appreciated.

796
01:24:58,233 --> 01:24:58,734
So thank you.

797
01:24:59,134 --> 01:24:59,454
Thank you.

798
01:24:59,474 --> 01:24:59,855
Counselor.

799
01:25:00,015 --> 01:25:00,916
Counselor Della Russo.

800
01:25:01,616 --> 01:25:02,457
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

801
01:25:02,977 --> 01:25:16,569
I attended last Wednesday night instead of our committee of the whole meeting, I attended a meeting sponsored by the department of transportation on the green line extension and there was there along with the mayor.

802
01:25:17,197 --> 01:25:26,222
and members of our state delegation to express concern by a number of the neighbours and butters to the project.

803
01:25:27,002 --> 01:25:44,752
One of the clear things that's emerged in this latest development of activity along the rail line or the rail corridor is the fact that much of the work proceeded without a point person, a point of contact for the neighbours.

804
01:25:45,478 --> 01:25:52,762
someone who would represent the construction company, the MBTA, the Department of Transportation, to the general public.

805
01:25:54,063 --> 01:26:04,929
We expressed that clearly to the members of the construction team that were present there, the management team from the MBTA, DOT, and the construction people.

806
01:26:05,629 --> 01:26:11,953
And so they got the message clear, not only from the elected officials present,

807
01:26:12,390 --> 01:26:19,894
but also from the neighbours, that they want someone that they can reach out and have open channels of communication where there are problems occurring.

808
01:26:20,235 --> 01:26:29,440
And they are occurring, and there's going to be a significant change, ambient change, to the area as this project continues.

809
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:41,647
There'll be elimination of virtually all the vegetation all the way up beyond the gymnasium at the corner of College Avenue to accommodate this project in the coming months.

810
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:56,636
They'll begin the process of widening the rail bed or moving the tracks further to the north to make way for the southern tracks that will be inserted.

811
01:26:57,217 --> 01:27:06,341
And we're going to see the insertion of retaining walls and the beginnings and foundations of sound barriers in the corridor.

812
01:27:06,381 --> 01:27:07,881
So they're ready to go.

813
01:27:08,142 --> 01:27:08,762
They're going.

814
01:27:08,982 --> 01:27:09,522
They're moving.

815
01:27:09,542 --> 01:27:10,463
They're doing the prep work.

816
01:27:12,047 --> 01:27:18,272
We can, uh, unless something happens with the funding at this point, uh, we can consider it underway.

817
01:27:18,972 --> 01:27:27,719
And, uh, so, uh, people are going to be affected, uh, and people will need someone to reach out to who was managing the project.

818
01:27:28,359 --> 01:27:31,862
And, um, uh, we made that our priority in that meeting.

819
01:27:32,463 --> 01:27:40,769
Uh, there will be another meeting, I think in a week or so, I forget the exact date, um, here in the council chambers, uh, for the general public of Medford.

820
01:27:41,493 --> 01:27:44,175
to speak on the issue of this green line extension.

821
01:27:44,655 --> 01:27:50,758
I know they're holding one I think this week or next week in Somerville.

822
01:27:51,299 --> 01:27:52,519
So it will be important.

823
01:27:52,880 --> 01:28:00,224
Everything is up on the city's web page and the green line extension web page as far as information and contacts on this.

824
01:28:00,644 --> 01:28:09,209
But I know that a number of people have felt the pressure by being constantly under construction up there for the past several years.

825
01:28:10,462 --> 01:28:14,183
a lot of utility work, and there has been disruption up there.

826
01:28:16,884 --> 01:28:19,385
We want to support the businesses up there.

827
01:28:19,966 --> 01:28:30,070
We want to support you and see that you're served properly up there and don't have to go under any more duress than is necessary.

828
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:33,111
Council President Caviello.

829
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:33,631
Thank you.

830
01:28:33,931 --> 01:28:38,633
I know Councilman Layton mentioned that the project that's up there will be finished in July,

831
01:28:39,712 --> 01:28:50,176
when I spoke to him saying, oh, he's telling me that another project is ready to go right behind it, and the developer of that property has made no attempt to work with the businesses.

832
01:28:51,236 --> 01:28:55,498
Again, total disregard for their needs before he started.

833
01:28:55,538 --> 01:29:05,941
So before this, say, as soon as one stops, no one's gonna start, and these guys, and same person, and these people, it'll be another two years before they get a break.

834
01:29:07,041 --> 01:29:08,182
I think something has to be done now,

835
01:29:09,455 --> 01:29:11,377
when this guy just decides to do whatever he wants.

836
01:29:11,977 --> 01:29:12,718
Thank you, Mr. President.

837
01:29:13,038 --> 01:29:14,119
Name and address of the record, sir.

838
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:18,042
It's Joseph Anoletto, 590 Boston Ave, Medford, Mass.

839
01:29:20,404 --> 01:29:28,311
Thank you primarily first for giving me this opportunity to speak about my grievances tonight in front of the council.

840
01:29:30,493 --> 01:29:32,294
Basically I've been grinning, bearing,

841
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:40,676
the impacts from the construction since the first phase of the Green Line, and I think it started in about October 2012.

842
01:29:45,019 --> 01:29:57,569
Surprisingly, the impacts from that construction, in particular to the Harvard Street Bridge, was not as significant as I thought in the beginning.

843
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:01,913
Because whoever was the engineer on that project

844
01:30:03,495 --> 01:30:10,060
particularly routing the traffic, they were cognizant of our ongoing day-to-day business.

845
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:15,823
And sales actually were pretty close to the sales before the work commenced.

846
01:30:18,645 --> 01:30:21,687
This situation, it's completely different.

847
01:30:21,767 --> 01:30:28,311
I mean, I've never been in comfort by road construction this badly in my entire life there.

848
01:30:28,392 --> 01:30:29,792
And I've been working on that corner since 1990.

849
01:30:32,201 --> 01:30:39,904
And I've probably been working on that corner every day, you know, seven days a week since 1998.

850
01:30:41,324 --> 01:30:49,687
So, I mean, I spend a significant amount of time in the neighborhood, and I know, you know, I have a feel for the flow of traffic and everything else.

851
01:30:49,747 --> 01:30:52,968
And it just seems like no one knows what's going on over there.

852
01:30:53,608 --> 01:30:56,589
I mean, customers are complaining about it to me every day.

853
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:03,749
You know, I had a hard time getting over here, and I came here after work instead of coming here in the morning.

854
01:31:04,970 --> 01:31:09,292
Some of them, you know, they're fed up with it.

855
01:31:11,354 --> 01:31:23,120
You know, to what extent do myself have to be responsible for loss of business for all this other work being done around me?

856
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:27,923
I mean, there was no, nobody really reached out to me before the utility work began.

857
01:31:29,323 --> 01:31:36,827
development project on Saturday and it just seems like the work started and I'm supposed to grin and bear the sentiment that I'm picking up off the street.

858
01:31:38,608 --> 01:31:50,234
Um, I mean, I realized that the entire area is going to change, you know, gentrification has taken place and you know, we all know that, but, uh, it's really starting to affect my bottom line.

859
01:31:50,654 --> 01:31:57,858
And, uh, it's the losses and particularly, uh, the last couple of months since Easter,

860
01:31:58,955 --> 01:32:03,356
have been significant to the point where I feel demoralized.

861
01:32:04,936 --> 01:32:13,558
You sit there when the top of Boston Ave is closed, and then Harvard Street, and then Warner Street's closed, and you're just sitting there twiddling your thumbs.

862
01:32:15,739 --> 01:32:24,681
So then the thing that really set me off is reading the scope of the work that Devereux Construction had outlined.

863
01:32:25,121 --> 01:32:28,162
They're going to be doing utility work Monday through Saturday in May.

864
01:32:29,171 --> 01:32:38,377
And I mean, the cow wash business, May is probably our busiest month of the year, and we really do rely on that revenue to get through the rest of the year, obviously because of the pollen season.

865
01:32:39,237 --> 01:32:46,302
And I can understand Monday through Friday from 7 to 4, but Monday through Saturday?

866
01:32:46,522 --> 01:32:49,124
Is it that necessary to do work on Saturday?

867
01:32:51,565 --> 01:32:55,928
Also, the way they've been running the traffic over there, it seems like they do it a different way every day.

868
01:32:57,633 --> 01:33:03,215
I mean, it's a, for lack of a better word, a mess.

869
01:33:06,916 --> 01:33:16,099
I just feel that the planning of this work was not well thought out from an inexperienced person.

870
01:33:16,559 --> 01:33:19,600
I've never been a traffic engineer in my life, and I probably never will.

871
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:21,941
But I just feel like something's wrong here.

872
01:33:22,681 --> 01:33:24,462
And I'm not the only one that said it.

873
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:35,198
Countless people have said, you know, you should be, you know, getting an attorney and all this other, you know, I'm trying to run a business on a day-to-day basis.

874
01:33:35,258 --> 01:33:48,223
I really don't want to go, you know, to those means because it's just going to suck up my time and compromise, you know, the business.

875
01:33:48,263 --> 01:33:55,746
I have to be there making sure I'm making improvements, making sure my customers are being paid, and a plethora of other,

876
01:33:56,617 --> 01:34:01,500
issues that go with running a business of that nature, a service business.

877
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:10,645
So, again, basically the premise of my grievance was outlined by Rick and Adam, you know, before I spoke.

878
01:34:10,725 --> 01:34:23,191
And, you know, I'd really appreciate any type of consideration that you as the council can give to us, not just myself, but the entire neighborhood over there as the rest of this work goes on.

879
01:34:24,832 --> 01:34:25,733
I would like to say, though,

880
01:34:27,968 --> 01:34:41,893
When they did do the first phase of work on the bridge, whoever was in charge of engineering the traffic flow did a significantly better job than it is now.

881
01:34:41,933 --> 01:34:51,276
Whoever is working, whoever is in charge of that dynamic is not doing a good job, in my opinion.

882
01:34:55,797 --> 01:34:56,558
Thank you for your comments.

883
01:34:58,538 --> 01:35:13,226
Mr. Enoletto, have you had any conversations with Tufts University or the city of Medford relative to the work that they're going to be proposing relative to the complete streets program in the reconfiguration of the intersection at Boston Avenue and at the top of the hill by the library?

884
01:35:13,707 --> 01:35:15,127
No, I've had no correspondence with Tufts.

885
01:35:15,307 --> 01:35:17,809
No correspondence with Tufts and nobody from the administration as well?

886
01:35:18,109 --> 01:35:19,190
No.

887
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:19,530
Okay.

888
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:27,074
Mr. President, if I could amend the paper to request that the city engineer reach out to Titan gas station to explain to him the scope and circumstances of the

889
01:35:27,665 --> 01:35:30,267
complete streets project going on at the top of Boston.

890
01:35:30,287 --> 01:35:31,567
That would be appreciated as well.

891
01:35:32,108 --> 01:35:32,388
Thank you.

892
01:35:33,148 --> 01:35:35,069
I think we have someone else behind you that would like to speak.

893
01:35:38,791 --> 01:35:40,532
Thank you.

894
01:35:41,733 --> 01:35:52,940
I feel like every meeting that I attend and I watch, we hear more and more about the onslaught that our residents and small business are facing in this city.

895
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:56,882
And I think it's becoming crucial

896
01:35:57,399 --> 01:36:11,089
that we demand that these folks that are working within our city limits reach out and communicate effectively with the people whose lives they're impacting.

897
01:36:11,749 --> 01:36:18,654
And in an area like Boston Ave, that isn't necessarily just the butters or people in the general neighborhood.

898
01:36:19,375 --> 01:36:22,016
That's a main area that people traverse through.

899
01:36:22,517 --> 01:36:23,938
There should be communications.

900
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:27,040
There should be transparencies for these things.

901
01:36:27,712 --> 01:36:30,894
And there should be representation of our residents.

902
01:36:31,434 --> 01:36:36,257
We really are, for lack of a better phrase, under attack.

903
01:36:37,157 --> 01:36:39,199
Everyone is feeling it across the board.

904
01:36:39,379 --> 01:36:40,860
They're feeling it on Boston Ave.

905
01:36:41,380 --> 01:36:46,923
They're feeling it up on Winthrop Street by the high school where there's demolition going on up there.

906
01:36:47,683 --> 01:36:53,267
Salem Street is getting set to feel its pains with the Break Probe Project.

907
01:36:53,827 --> 01:36:55,788
I don't know if that statement has come out yet.

908
01:36:56,354 --> 01:36:58,596
But we expect that to be happening.

909
01:36:59,256 --> 01:37:09,204
And yet we continue to see the south street area there under attack too by their onslaught of development that's happening there.

910
01:37:09,244 --> 01:37:18,272
But we continue to see these groups, teams and individuals come into our city and run roughshod over everybody.

911
01:37:18,892 --> 01:37:20,914
And yes, gentrification is underway.

912
01:37:21,354 --> 01:37:23,956
But we certainly don't have to sit back and just accept it.

913
01:37:24,417 --> 01:37:25,998
And gentrification isn't only

914
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:29,400
going to occur to just our seniors.

915
01:37:30,540 --> 01:37:32,741
It's going to occur to our businesses as well.

916
01:37:33,201 --> 01:37:48,686
And so we talk about things like how to revitalize Medford Square and bring back small businesses where you hear about, you know, organizations and companies that are suffering because their foot traffic and vehicle traffic is being removed.

917
01:37:49,206 --> 01:37:54,948
We look at someone like Carol's who's been under onslaught now for months upon months with bridge

918
01:37:55,636 --> 01:37:58,598
that's going to extend and extend and extend.

919
01:37:59,198 --> 01:38:09,603
And it troubles me greatly because we keep discussing these things, and the situation seemingly is getting worse and worse.

920
01:38:09,803 --> 01:38:19,228
We talk about things like development committees made up of residents, and I think we talked about that weeks ago now, haven't heard a word back about it.

921
01:38:19,809 --> 01:38:24,191
So, you know, I've said it before, I'll say it again,

922
01:38:25,507 --> 01:38:34,594
zoning, development, yes, there are departments that are involved, but the purview of it resides with this Council.

923
01:38:35,355 --> 01:38:50,566
And I would urge you, if we don't do something as a group to set limits and insist upon the rules of engagement for these folks, it's going to come to a head somehow.

924
01:38:53,712 --> 01:38:58,674
That in conjunction with the airplanes and everything, it's just, it's crazy right now in the city of Medford.

925
01:38:58,835 --> 01:39:07,899
And we look to you guys because we know how much you all love the city like we do, but it's, next week it's going to be someone else coming up.

926
01:39:08,119 --> 01:39:19,685
You know, there's always something going on and until, unless and until we insist that they have those communication plans and

927
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:26,253
use the proper methods to communicate them effectively throughout the city when appropriate.

928
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:28,015
It's just going to continue to go on.

929
01:39:28,955 --> 01:39:29,415
Thank you.

930
01:39:29,876 --> 01:39:33,098
Thank you for your comments on the motion by council president Caviello.

931
01:39:33,458 --> 01:39:36,900
Second council Lungo Kern.

932
01:39:36,980 --> 01:39:37,300
Thank you.

933
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:41,883
Um, just if we could read back what the resolve is, just so we know what we're voting on.

934
01:39:44,185 --> 01:39:44,705
Turn on the mic.

935
01:39:52,698 --> 01:39:56,540
Did you have the, uh, I'm looking for the, cause this is a petition.

936
01:39:56,580 --> 01:40:01,682
So I'm trying to kind of, uh, okay.

937
01:40:01,762 --> 01:40:02,183
Okay.

938
01:40:03,043 --> 01:40:11,227
So the resolve is, uh, uh, Memphis city council discuss the problems caused by construction of Boston Avenue to Harvard street.

939
01:40:11,247 --> 01:40:12,408
And then we have amendment.

940
01:40:18,130 --> 01:40:18,371
Okay.

941
01:40:18,391 --> 01:40:21,232
The city engineer, uh, reach out to the, uh,

942
01:40:22,008 --> 01:40:29,772
uh, business owners of Titan to, uh, to further explain the scope of the service and construction and the ongoing process, uh, to them.

943
01:40:30,832 --> 01:40:35,474
Um, let's see.

944
01:40:36,395 --> 01:40:37,875
Is that a Council of Knights amendment?

945
01:40:39,056 --> 01:40:40,717
This is the Council of Knights amendment.

946
01:40:40,737 --> 01:40:41,777
Councilor Scott Kelly.

947
01:40:41,957 --> 01:40:43,258
Now let me see, uh,

948
01:40:44,975 --> 01:40:57,826
Scott Pelley is looking for the City Engineer to provide a start time and end time of the projects to reach out and provide some notifications to the residents or businesses in there.

949
01:40:59,187 --> 01:41:00,408
Let me see here.

950
01:41:00,428 --> 01:41:09,216
And President Calvillo, City Engineer, give some time, let's see here.

951
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:16,360
scope of time, you know, when, when the projects, these projects are going to continue.

952
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,881
So they were also looking for a start and end time.

953
01:41:19,822 --> 01:41:25,385
Um, if then nothing's been mentioned with regards to traffic flow and who's in charge of traffic flow.

954
01:41:25,485 --> 01:41:26,705
So if we could.

955
01:41:26,725 --> 01:41:38,492
The Councilor Knight asked for, uh, uh, traffic plans from the, uh, uh, MBTA, uh, and, uh, and the, uh, traffic plans for the, uh,

956
01:41:40,033 --> 01:41:46,319
construction at Harvard and Boston Avenue and surrounding areas.

957
01:41:46,659 --> 01:42:01,193
I just think that's the main point of the, one of the main points of the complainant, that we look into the traffic flow and make sure it's flowing the same every day and in a way that works.

958
01:42:01,293 --> 01:42:05,817
So I second approval of the paper and hopefully the administration can

959
01:42:06,591 --> 01:42:14,574
get on the MBTA as well, if we could ask the administration to also reach out to the MBTA and ask them to make sure traffic's flowing.

960
01:42:14,874 --> 01:42:16,035
We need to keep on top of it.

961
01:42:16,155 --> 01:42:23,158
As a city, we need to make sure that traffic is flowing for our residents and the business owners, and that it's consistent day after day.

962
01:42:23,178 --> 01:42:26,079
Because as a business owner, you feel the frustration.

963
01:42:26,119 --> 01:42:27,440
You don't want anybody to be hurting.

964
01:42:27,860 --> 01:42:31,021
And if it comes down to it, construction's going to go on everywhere.

965
01:42:31,401 --> 01:42:35,363
But if it comes down to actually just managing your traffic flow,

966
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:45,384
on a consistent basis so the residents and the people that frequent these businesses know how to get point A to point B the same way every day.

967
01:42:45,704 --> 01:42:49,045
That's a simple fix that should be done and should be implemented.

968
01:42:49,145 --> 01:42:58,549
So I ask that the mayor's office get on this and I second the resolve, especially asking the MBTA to figure it out for our residents and our business owners.

969
01:43:00,046 --> 01:43:10,174
On the motion offered by President Caviello, seconded by Councilor Wendell Kern, amended by Councilor Knight, further amended by Councilor Scapelli, and President Caviello.

970
01:43:10,634 --> 01:43:11,295

971
01:43:11,935 --> 01:43:12,056

The ayes have it.

974
01:43:13,997 --> 01:43:15,078
The motion is adopted.

975
01:43:15,999 --> 01:43:19,982
Motion to revert back to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Knight.

976
01:43:20,542 --> 01:43:21,303

01:43:21,663 --> 01:43:21,823
Aye.

978
01:43:22,304 --> 01:43:22,844
The ayes have it.

979
01:43:27,708 --> 01:43:28,749

Councilor Knight, he was the chairman of zoning.

999
01:45:46,705 --> 01:45:48,205
How have you found the papers?

1000
01:45:54,567 --> 01:45:56,548
Mr. President, upon reviewing the papers, I do have a...

1001
01:45:57,645 --> 01:46:02,471
Before us we have petition to the hours of operation from 7 a.m.

1002
01:46:02,491 --> 01:46:04,613
In the morning till 2 a.m.

1003
01:46:04,653 --> 01:46:12,542
That would be the certified hours of operation at this paper We can explain to me what the hours of operation are at Annie's pizzeria

1004
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:15,792
in terms of when they are actually going to be open and operating?

1005
01:46:16,592 --> 01:46:18,094
Well, we don't have a launch.

1006
01:46:19,354 --> 01:46:22,377
Basically, we open from 11 to 10, actually.

1007
01:46:23,418 --> 01:46:29,923
And then what we need is then the hours is after 10, from 2 in the morning.

1008
01:46:30,623 --> 01:46:32,044
But we don't have a launch.

1009
01:46:32,144 --> 01:46:33,185
Basically, we open at 11.

1010
01:46:34,166 --> 01:46:35,247
11, OK.

1011
01:46:35,407 --> 01:46:35,607
Yes.

1012
01:46:35,887 --> 01:46:37,388
And how many employees do you have working for you?

1013
01:46:38,109 --> 01:46:39,110
I have four.

1014
01:46:39,730 --> 01:46:40,631
Four employees working for you?

1015
01:46:41,079 --> 01:46:46,962
Mr. President, as I review the paperwork here, I see the statement of workers' compensation insurance affidavit for a gentleman.

1016
01:46:47,603 --> 01:46:55,007
In box number two on the state form, which I have a little bit of familiarity of, it says, I am a sole proprietor of a partnership and have no employees working for me in any capacity.

1017
01:46:55,427 --> 01:47:01,150
If, in fact, the gentleman does have four employees working for him, he will be required to purchase workers' compensation insurance.

1018
01:47:01,390 --> 01:47:09,555
In terms of the materials that have been submitted to the council this evening, they are complete in terms of the accuracy as to whether or not he's not going to be required to carry workers' compensation.

1019
01:47:10,391 --> 01:47:39,040
different story Mr. if in fact he does have four employees that are working for him that are not part of the sole proprietorship of the business partnership then he will be required to purchase workers compensation insurance purchase the workers compensation insurance does of hundred if you are found in violation of the workers compensation act and fail to appeal it $250 a day if you found in violation of the workers compensation act and do appeal it so I guess my question to the gentleman at the podium right now is if in fact you do have a

1020
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:50,552
that are working for you and you are currently in operation, you will be found in violation of the law if these people aren't at least 25 years of your corporation.

1021
01:47:51,032 --> 01:47:55,174
Yeah, I explained to Sylvia in the clerk department.

1022
01:47:55,835 --> 01:48:06,880
As my wife and me have kids working, I need to know how many hours I have those employees because I don't know if I can hire them.

1023
01:48:07,884 --> 01:48:10,746
But if I extend my hours, I'm going to hire them.

1024
01:48:11,467 --> 01:48:11,867
Not yet.

1025
01:48:11,887 --> 01:48:12,868
I don't have it yet.

1026
01:48:13,128 --> 01:48:15,530
So right now, you're open from 11?

1027
01:48:15,650 --> 01:48:17,712
It's just my wife and me.

1028
01:48:17,752 --> 01:48:19,473
We are in the checkbooks.

1029
01:48:19,773 --> 01:48:21,375
And my son just give us help.

1030
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:21,735
OK.

1031
01:48:21,755 --> 01:48:27,860
So the articles of incorporation that were filed at the Secretary of State's office would list the offices and principles of the corporation and yourself and your wife?

1032
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:28,700
Yeah.

1033
01:48:28,861 --> 01:48:29,321
And no others?

1034
01:48:29,701 --> 01:48:29,901
No.

1035
01:48:30,142 --> 01:48:36,967
And then if the Department of Industrial Accidents Investigation Division happened to go to 213 Middlesex Avenue,

1036
01:48:37,532 --> 01:48:43,637
and went behind the counter, the only people that would be working, including delivering, cooking food, working cash register, any of that?

1037
01:48:44,017 --> 01:48:45,058
Well, it's a small business.

1038
01:48:45,078 --> 01:48:47,080
We just started, but we want to grow.

1039
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:49,241
So that's why we want to spend hours.

1040
01:48:49,502 --> 01:48:59,029
If we spend hours, I don't choose going to hire probably two more employees, but I'm going to hire maybe a driver, an extra driver.

1041
01:48:59,890 --> 01:49:04,173
So as long as you're aware that if, in fact, you do hire employees that are in excess of your ground.

1042
01:49:04,293 --> 01:49:05,114
Oh, definitely.

1043
01:49:05,414 --> 01:49:06,475
Of the individuals in your group.

1044
01:49:07,139 --> 01:49:13,064
Mr. President, based upon the conversation I've had with the gentleman, I do feel as though the paper is in order and complete.

1045
01:49:13,704 --> 01:49:22,631
I would suggest that because of the nature of the permit and the willingness for the employee to keep his business open until 2 o'clock in the morning, we place a 90-day review on this.

1046
01:49:22,971 --> 01:49:29,076
I would also recommend, Mr. President, that if approved, that the approval for extended hours would stay with the business and not the address.

1047
01:49:29,496 --> 01:49:35,241
So that if the business moves, then the permit for extended hours would die with the relocation of the business.

1048
01:49:40,084 --> 01:49:45,530
If I could, through the chair, Mr. President, ask why do you wish to stay open so late?

1049
01:49:47,092 --> 01:49:48,433
Like I said, we want to grow.

1050
01:49:48,453 --> 01:49:59,124
We want to, you know, especially people who are awake late, not us, we are sleeping early, but I know the market.

1051
01:49:59,384 --> 01:50:02,968
I have a friend of mine who has a pizzeria in Somerville.

1052
01:50:03,475 --> 01:50:08,738
And they catch most of the business right now after those hours because everybody else closed.

1053
01:50:09,559 --> 01:50:17,704
And then I request to some of my neighbors and my customers if they say it could be also because it's anything open at that time.

1054
01:50:18,244 --> 01:50:22,227
Sometimes we are late of the jobs and it's nothing open.

1055
01:50:22,827 --> 01:50:24,068
It could be really good for you.

1056
01:50:24,108 --> 01:50:24,768
Why you don't try?

1057
01:50:24,788 --> 01:50:25,849
That's what I'm trying.

1058
01:50:25,909 --> 01:50:30,732
I mean, I'm just trying to see if I can grow, you know.

1059
01:50:31,756 --> 01:50:34,137
And if I could, do you offer a delivery service?

1060
01:50:35,377 --> 01:50:36,998
Do you have deliveries of pizza?

1061
01:50:37,298 --> 01:50:37,498
Yes.

1062
01:50:37,518 --> 01:50:38,599
Yes.

1063
01:50:38,759 --> 01:50:41,840
It must be most of the business that probably deliver.

1064
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:42,640
That's what I say.

1065
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:52,284
If I, if I extend the hours, if I can give me that opportunity, I can, you know, hire more people and more drivers because I can do it myself.

1066
01:50:52,564 --> 01:50:53,024
Definitely.

1067
01:50:53,545 --> 01:50:53,925
Thank you.

1068
01:50:54,505 --> 01:50:59,507
Mr. President, if I might say, uh, in the past, when faced with these requests,

1069
01:51:00,873 --> 01:51:14,163
When there's been opposition, those people have made themselves known either by informing myself and other councillors or by making themselves present here at a council meeting.

1070
01:51:15,024 --> 01:51:20,788
I can think of one instance where the proprietor of the franchise was quite persistent.

1071
01:51:21,608 --> 01:51:27,473
In fact, the first time he petitioned us for extended hours, he arrived here with a dozen pizzas for us.

1072
01:51:28,273 --> 01:51:29,254
I did not partake.

1073
01:51:31,898 --> 01:51:36,901
And quite frankly, I don't partake of that brand at all, ever.

1074
01:51:37,681 --> 01:51:53,991
However, so many of my neighbors were quick to point out, and many of them made themselves present here, and many of them made an effort to contact me at my office to say that they did not want this going on because they did not want these cars speeding through the neighborhood.

1075
01:51:56,152 --> 01:51:59,114
As president, I've not been contacted by anybody here.

1076
01:51:59,932 --> 01:52:04,333
uh, nor have I seen anybody present to speak in opposition.

1077
01:52:04,813 --> 01:52:27,258
And I might say that the chairman has made an excellent measure by pointing out that we should have a 90 day review on this and that the, uh, uh, that if the, uh, extended hours of operation are granted, that they'd be granted only to the petitioner and not to a subsequent owner nor towards the property permanently.

1078
01:52:28,438 --> 01:52:28,758
Thank you.

1079
01:52:29,595 --> 01:52:30,676
Vice president marks.

1080
01:52:31,556 --> 01:52:32,557
Thank you, Mr. President.

1081
01:52:32,797 --> 01:52:36,840
And, um, the petitioner mentioned that he's only open till 10 PM.

1082
01:52:37,441 --> 01:52:37,641
Yes.

1083
01:52:38,141 --> 01:52:43,525
Your license right now is until 11 until 11, but I close at 10.

1084
01:52:44,085 --> 01:52:44,265
Right.

1085
01:52:44,305 --> 01:52:45,726
So, so you're closing at 10.

1086
01:52:45,766 --> 01:52:46,987
You're able to open till 11.

1087
01:52:47,728 --> 01:52:49,429
Now you want to stay open till 2 AM.

1088
01:52:49,789 --> 01:52:50,170
Yeah.

1089
01:52:50,550 --> 01:52:57,795
Um, usually between, um, 9 PM to 11 is totally that.

1090
01:52:58,688 --> 01:53:00,730
It's like a time to clean and go home.

1091
01:53:02,071 --> 01:53:11,077
Um, but when everybody else flows after 11 is when you can catch some businesses because we have something on online.

1092
01:53:12,879 --> 01:53:21,185
Mr. President, um, you know, we've taken these petitions, uh, for extended licenses, uh, based on a number of circumstances.

1093
01:53:21,726 --> 01:53:26,109
And, uh, each petition is an individual petition based on its own merits.

1094
01:53:27,048 --> 01:53:33,333
And I would venture to say, Mr. President, that this particular business is nestled between homes.

1095
01:53:33,733 --> 01:53:35,174
You have homes across the street.

1096
01:53:35,494 --> 01:53:37,656
You have homes on either side, Mr. President.

1097
01:53:38,216 --> 01:53:40,658
And in my opinion, a 2 a.m.

1098
01:53:41,058 --> 01:53:48,023
closing would pose a severe quality of life issue for area residents in that particular area.

1099
01:53:48,503 --> 01:53:51,945
So even with a 90-day, which I think is a very

1100
01:53:53,216 --> 01:53:55,557
amendable way of trying to put things through.

1101
01:53:56,278 --> 01:53:58,639
I don't support that, Mr. President.

1102
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:13,346
If the gentleman wanted to open maybe until midnight and start off at midnight, and that would give him 11 and 12, which he's not opening 11, he has my right, it would give him 11 and 12, and then see how it goes.

1103
01:54:14,086 --> 01:54:18,168
And then in six months from now or a year from now, say maybe I'd like to open till 1.

1104
01:54:18,969 --> 01:54:21,450
But to start off at 2 a.m., Mr. President,

1105
01:54:21,837 --> 01:54:24,139
in an area that's already congested.

1106
01:54:25,079 --> 01:54:32,104
All those stores, as the gentleman mentioned, are closed after probably 11 o'clock's the latest, maybe midnight.

1107
01:54:33,005 --> 01:54:43,732
And this would be two hours after that of hearing doors open and close and having this be, as the gentleman alluded to, the spot where you can go get a pizza at two in the morning.

1108
01:54:44,392 --> 01:54:49,696
And I don't know if the neighbors, in my opinion, are willing to put up with that.

1109
01:54:50,063 --> 01:54:51,284
And this is a special permit.

1110
01:54:51,324 --> 01:54:52,204
This is not by right.

1111
01:54:52,584 --> 01:54:53,645
This is a special permit.

1112
01:54:53,965 --> 01:54:57,627
So at this time, Mr. President, I cannot sign off on this.

1113
01:54:58,327 --> 01:55:03,029
I'd be willing to go up to midnight on a provisional basis.

1114
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:08,772
And then if we hear back from residents that everything's fine with midnight, maybe we could explore one.

1115
01:55:09,352 --> 01:55:14,214
But to go right to 2 a.m., Mr. President, Mr. Clark, how many operations do we have in the city at 2 a.m.? ?

1116
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:16,980
several citywide.

1117
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:18,601
But we have hundreds of businesses.

1118
01:55:18,881 --> 01:55:21,101
We may have several that are open citywide.

1119
01:55:21,161 --> 01:55:24,882
And again, Mr. President, I'm not saying anything.

1120
01:55:24,902 --> 01:55:28,523
I know that business has turned over a number of times.

1121
01:55:28,903 --> 01:55:33,824
I live right around the corner, and that's changed hands a number of times, that business, over the years.

1122
01:55:34,244 --> 01:55:37,845
So I know it's been a tough location, and I wish you well there.

1123
01:55:37,885 --> 01:55:40,006
But to me, 2 a.m.

1124
01:55:40,186 --> 01:55:44,167
is — I just can't support that based on the neighbors, Mr. President.

1125
01:55:47,705 --> 01:55:48,306
Councilor Knight.

1126
01:55:48,646 --> 01:56:00,676
Um, Mr. President, I do believe we ran into a similar situation back when we were discussing the extended hours at the old Panda Palace location, which is now Shanghai moon.

1127
01:56:01,537 --> 01:56:04,400
And we did a phase it and we phased it in.

1128
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:13,147
I believe we said for the first six months it would be X for the next three months it will be Y. Um, for the final three months it would be Z and we had a review step at each step of the way.

1129
01:56:13,648 --> 01:56:14,008
And, um,

1130
01:56:14,582 --> 01:56:25,732
If the council is amenable, I mean, maybe that's a solution right now where we can help the gentleman out and there'll be an agreement that we give him a 90-day permit until midnight and then maybe a 90-day review after midnight.

1131
01:56:25,812 --> 01:56:29,215
And then if there are no issues, it would revert for another 90-day period until 1 a.m.

1132
01:56:29,415 --> 01:56:32,638
And if there's no issues there, then it would revert to a 2 a.m.

1133
01:56:32,698 --> 01:56:34,220
license with another 90-day review.

1134
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:39,124
So in essence, we'd have, you know, a year and a half, a year and a half review.

1135
01:56:39,655 --> 01:56:50,862
of the extended hours and they'd be gradually implemented so that if any instances or issues in the neighbourhood arise, we'll be able to nip them in the bud within 90 days of the event occurring.

1136
01:56:51,703 --> 01:56:56,746
And then we can always, you know, have an opportunity to correct the wrongs if any are made.

1137
01:56:56,826 --> 01:56:59,408
But if any aren't, then we can help the business owners succeed.

1138
01:56:59,428 --> 01:57:08,614
I know the council has discussed the difficulty it is for businesses to be competitive in the City of Medford based upon a number of circumstances.

1139
01:57:09,098 --> 01:57:15,262
And I believe that the extended hours was a permitting process that was put in place to address some of those concerns.

1140
01:57:15,322 --> 01:57:21,245
And I'm hoping that maybe we can all sit down here and put our heads together and come up with a methodology that might work for everybody involved.

1141
01:57:21,305 --> 01:57:31,251
So I'd ask the Councillor if he feels as though that would be a suitable recommendation to do an increase of one hour, reach 90 days with a 90-day review thereof.

1142
01:57:31,271 --> 01:57:34,253
And maybe that'll be a solution of compromise for all involved.

1143
01:57:38,124 --> 01:57:39,565
I like the resolve through the chair.

1144
01:57:41,266 --> 01:58:05,923
But did you have you talked to your you said the neighbors are asking you to stay open because I forget a book but I have a lot of signatures from I collect like 120 now I know there's a couple homes across the street have you especially the across the street all of them they and they said I'm not I don't know I'm okay with that but I forgot especially is

1145
01:58:07,464 --> 01:58:13,286
A guy across the street, he said, I received your letter, and I signed it.

1146
01:58:13,346 --> 01:58:14,887
I said, OK, it's not a problem.

1147
01:58:15,047 --> 01:58:16,587
Oh, and he signed your petition?

1148
01:58:16,627 --> 01:58:16,907
Yeah.

1149
01:58:17,728 --> 01:58:19,468
What time does Cafe Mari stay open, Tom?

1150
01:58:20,229 --> 01:58:20,469
Who?

1151
01:58:20,609 --> 01:58:21,949
Cafe Mari, the coffee shop there.

1152
01:58:22,009 --> 01:58:22,910
I think always.

1153
01:58:23,150 --> 01:58:24,150
Is he one o'clock?

1154
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:26,191
Something like that, yeah.

1155
01:58:26,831 --> 01:58:26,911
Oh.

1156
01:58:28,570 --> 01:58:29,491
Sometimes like that.

1157
01:58:29,551 --> 01:58:37,537
Yeah, sometimes I stay late not open because I have to clean something or make prep things and I get out of there 1130 and they still open.

1158
01:58:37,557 --> 01:58:40,919
Yeah.

1159
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:42,220
Thank you, Mr. President.

1160
01:58:42,361 --> 01:58:48,565
Um, I, I do have a couple of concerns regarding the late time, uh, stay until 2am.

1161
01:58:48,845 --> 01:58:53,849
Um, and I do like the staged approach as to, you know, just kind of maybe increasing it over time.

1162
01:58:53,909 --> 01:58:56,031
So I'm not completely against this, but, uh,

1163
01:58:56,488 --> 01:58:58,550
How many drivers do you have delivering?

1164
01:58:59,290 --> 01:59:00,091
Right now, one.

1165
01:59:00,351 --> 01:59:00,551
One.

1166
01:59:00,911 --> 01:59:05,075
But I know if I get late, because I know the business from that time.

1167
01:59:05,135 --> 01:59:09,618
I have my friend experience in Somerville and Magoon Square.

1168
01:59:10,410 --> 01:59:14,952
He told me you probably need two more because it's busy time.

1169
01:59:15,012 --> 01:59:16,673
Everybody is closed.

1170
01:59:16,713 --> 01:59:17,673
I understand.

1171
01:59:17,873 --> 01:59:22,035
That's a little bit of my concern because if you're going to go until 2 a.m.

1172
01:59:22,475 --> 01:59:26,396
and then if you go up two drivers, you're going to have three drivers.

1173
01:59:27,697 --> 01:59:30,058
Three drivers coming and going at 2 a.m.

1174
01:59:30,618 --> 01:59:33,719
is really doors opening, closing.

1175
01:59:34,519 --> 01:59:37,381
You have cars driving around at 2 a.m.

1176
01:59:37,421 --> 01:59:38,001
in a residential

1177
01:59:38,926 --> 01:59:44,367
That's a bit of a concern, to me at least, and I think that it's something that needs to be looked at.

1178
01:59:45,187 --> 01:59:54,109
I want to see you succeed, believe me, but I also want to make sure that we're safeguarding the neighbourhood and making sure that people get a good night's sleep.

1179
01:59:54,709 --> 02:00:04,950
If you have three drivers going back and forth at 2 a.m., especially if you're delivering up until 2, that means they might be coming back to the shop after 2.

1180
02:00:06,351 --> 02:00:07,291
So we're talking maybe 2.30.

1181
02:00:08,848 --> 02:00:10,548
you know, when you really look at it.

1182
02:00:10,948 --> 02:00:21,911
So I would definitely be, you know, in favour of the compromised proposal by council tonight, you know, just kind of going in stages and maybe increasing, you know, over time.

1183
02:00:22,611 --> 02:00:33,273
But, you know, if you're going to be going from one driver to three drivers and having all those cars coming and going that late at night or early in the morning, that is definitely a concern.

1184
02:00:33,453 --> 02:00:36,074
But I am definitely in favour of the staged approach.

1185
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:37,171
Thank you.

1186
02:00:37,431 --> 02:00:37,771
Thank you.

1187
02:00:53,636 --> 02:00:55,697
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday is dead.

1188
02:00:56,697 --> 02:00:59,397
You know, Sundays everybody has to go to work or school.

1189
02:00:59,578 --> 02:00:59,978
It's dead.

1190
02:00:59,998 --> 02:01:02,498
There's no reason to stay on Monday or Tuesday.

1191
02:01:02,918 --> 02:01:05,019
I want to do it Wednesday to Saturday.

1192
02:01:05,639 --> 02:01:11,020
Because I know people start to get money and pay checks weekends, you know, definitely.

1193
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:21,743
Mr. President, I think it may make sense to, based upon the feedback that I think I'm receiving from my colleagues, that we put a 90-day review, grant a special permit from 11 to 12 with a 90-day review.

1194
02:01:23,409 --> 02:01:31,174
If there are no instances or issues, that we will grant the automatic permit from 12 to 1 with a 90-day review.

1195
02:01:31,194 --> 02:01:37,158
And if there are no issues thereafter, we grant a permit from 1 to 2 automatic with a 90-day review.

1196
02:01:38,659 --> 02:01:46,904
Mr. President, I think that the last 90-day review, when the permit is in place from 1 to 2 a.m., should be restricted maybe to the Wednesday through Saturday.

1197
02:01:47,744 --> 02:01:52,167
Or maybe it should be restricted Wednesday through Saturday for the 12 to 1 and the 1 to 2.

1198
02:01:53,358 --> 02:02:02,185
so that we can get through the 90-day review periods with them operating Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, the extended hours, and then we can get a better feel from the neighborhood what's going on.

1199
02:02:02,725 --> 02:02:03,426
We'd be approving it.

1200
02:02:03,446 --> 02:02:06,087
We wouldn't be approving it for seven days of the week, and we wouldn't be approving it 100%.

1201
02:02:06,708 --> 02:02:07,949
We'd be gradually phasing it in.

1202
02:02:07,989 --> 02:02:12,492
So if any questions or concerns do arise, we'll be able to address them within short order.

1203
02:02:12,772 --> 02:02:13,072
Thank you.

1204
02:02:13,373 --> 02:02:14,694
Mr. Bozo, are you happy with that?

1205
02:02:15,154 --> 02:02:15,975
No, that's fine.

1206
02:02:15,995 --> 02:02:16,535
You're fine with that?

1207
02:02:16,575 --> 02:02:17,115
I appreciate it.

1208
02:02:17,155 --> 02:02:18,616
Thank you for any help.

1209
02:02:22,967 --> 02:02:28,331
On the boat, vice president of box, just so I can understand.

1210
02:02:28,411 --> 02:02:42,602
So will the petitioner then appear before us in 90 days or cause I heard automatic mentioned one, one time when you were mentioning it, um, where I was looking at it was if there's no issue that arises, if there's no concern, no complaint, then

1211
02:02:43,377 --> 02:02:50,502
it automatically be granted the next level of, so, so if there's one complaint that he's not going to get approved, we'll bring him in and we'll discuss it and figure out what's going on.

1212
02:02:50,542 --> 02:02:52,343
That's why I think he should come in automatically.

1213
02:02:52,764 --> 02:02:53,484
And that's fine.

1214
02:02:53,984 --> 02:02:59,989
I'll be quite honest with him is I don't mind the phase, but I won't go past a 1am at any point.

1215
02:03:00,489 --> 02:03:03,371
I think 2am is too much to ask for the neighborhood.

1216
02:03:03,791 --> 02:03:06,133
So I don't mind the first phase to go up to midnight.

1217
02:03:06,673 --> 02:03:09,375
I might even support the one depending on feedback.

1218
02:03:09,850 --> 02:03:11,771
But I'm definitely not going to go up to 2 a.m.

1219
02:03:11,971 --> 02:03:13,371
in that particular area, Mr. President.

1220
02:03:14,031 --> 02:03:16,832
I think it's a fair compromise and I'd support that wholeheartedly, Mr. President.

1221
02:03:16,932 --> 02:03:18,652
I'm doing a 90-day review, bringing them back in.

1222
02:03:18,672 --> 02:03:20,373
I think that that's a good way to proceed.

1223
02:03:20,393 --> 02:03:23,074
It protects the neighborhood and it also helps the business owner compete.

1224
02:03:23,094 --> 02:03:24,154
All right.

1225
02:03:26,175 --> 02:03:38,598
On the motion by Councillor Knight, with the stipulations that we have, seconded by Councillor DelaRusso, this is a special permit, so it does need

1226
02:03:39,162 --> 02:03:40,143
five votes.

1227
02:03:40,703 --> 02:03:42,705
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1228
02:03:46,968 --> 02:03:49,049
He goes with the petitioner.

1229
02:03:49,129 --> 02:03:51,951
It'll be 90 days from 12 o'clock.

1230
02:03:51,991 --> 02:03:55,054
Wednesday through Saturday.

1231
02:04:07,274 --> 02:04:10,235
90-day review, first 90-day review, 90-day review, 12 to 1.

1232
02:04:10,975 --> 02:04:11,395
With no issues.

1233
02:04:29,043 --> 02:04:34,689
90 days to make sure that there are no problems.

1234
02:04:36,030 --> 02:04:37,191
Mr. Coy, please call the roll.

1235
02:04:38,773 --> 02:04:44,598
I believe there is a section, there's a section in our agenda that, um, might indicate papers requiring action.

1236
02:04:45,259 --> 02:04:52,286
And, um, I'd request that, um, this matter be placed on, uh, unfinished business rather that this matter be placed on unfinished business so that it comes up in the 90 days.

1237
02:04:52,962 --> 02:04:57,123
so that it's on the agenda.

1238
02:04:57,744 --> 02:04:59,084
Reports do.

1239
02:04:59,164 --> 02:04:59,324
Okay.

1240
02:04:59,384 --> 02:04:59,524
Yeah.

1241
02:04:59,564 --> 02:05:00,344
So it'll be in there.

1242
02:05:00,404 --> 02:05:02,105
So it'll be on the agenda for the next 90 days.

1243
02:05:02,165 --> 02:05:03,846
So we have a date cert coming up.

1244
02:05:04,566 --> 02:05:04,926
Thank you.

1245
02:05:05,506 --> 02:05:06,787
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1246
02:05:07,427 --> 02:05:07,607
Yes.

1247
02:05:07,667 --> 02:05:07,727
Yes.

1248
02:05:07,747 --> 02:05:07,847
Yes.

1249
02:05:07,867 --> 02:05:07,947
Yes.

1250
02:05:08,007 --> 02:05:08,087
Yes.

1251
02:05:08,107 --> 02:05:08,267
Yes.

1252
02:05:08,447 --> 02:05:08,607
Yes.

1253
02:05:21,171 --> 02:05:22,994
7 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1254
02:05:23,294 --> 02:05:24,095
Motion passes.

1255
02:05:24,416 --> 02:05:24,817
Good luck.

1256
02:05:25,217 --> 02:05:25,498
Thank you.

1257
02:05:25,518 --> 02:05:26,399
See you in 90 days.

1258
02:05:26,820 --> 02:05:28,322
I promise you, I'm going to do my best.

1259
02:05:28,443 --> 02:05:29,625
And bring pizzas next time for us.

1260
02:05:29,665 --> 02:05:30,045
We're hungry.

1261
02:05:30,065 --> 02:05:30,406
It's late.

1262
02:05:32,543 --> 02:05:36,305
All right, motions, orders, and resolutions.

1263
02:05:36,325 --> 02:05:59,856
17-505, offered by Vice President Mox, being resolved that the city administration perform a complete audit on the condition of our roads and provide the council with a complete assessment, including curbing, sidewalk, catch basin, sewer covers, and handicapped rents, being further resolved that the city prioritize the list according to the road and infrastructure condition.

1264
02:06:00,296 --> 02:06:01,437
Vice President Mox.

1265
02:06:02,557 --> 02:06:18,542
Thank you Mr. President and you know this has been an issue that's been on the council agenda probably for the last several years and it's an issue that I believe is one of the top three issues

1266
02:06:19,005 --> 02:06:21,425
that I feel as a member of the city council.

1267
02:06:21,865 --> 02:06:39,088
And it's been, it's been very consistent over the years, the poor condition of our roads and the fact that, uh, in my opinion, uh, the city really doesn't have a game plan on, uh, repairing the roads or replacing our roads.

1268
02:06:39,829 --> 02:06:45,990
And I did a little homework and went into, uh, the engineering department last week.

1269
02:06:46,330 --> 02:06:47,830
I went into the finance department.

1270
02:06:48,263 --> 02:06:52,947
to get a little information on really what we're doing as a community on our streets.

1271
02:06:53,788 --> 02:06:56,270
And I found it pretty interesting, Mr. President.

1272
02:06:56,970 --> 02:07:04,036
First of all, a lion's share of the money we receive every year to do road work comes from the state.

1273
02:07:04,837 --> 02:07:06,498
It comes from Chapter 90 money.

1274
02:07:07,419 --> 02:07:15,966
And many people at home may not know, but Chapter 90 money is a program that entitles municipalities to 100% reimbursement

1275
02:07:17,635 --> 02:07:22,244
of documented expenditures on approved projects for maintaining

1276
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:28,525
repairing, improving and constructing town and county ways and bridges.

1277
02:07:29,326 --> 02:07:38,274
So we get roughly $900,000 a year through this chapter 90 money earmarked to improvement of our roads.

1278
02:07:39,075 --> 02:07:49,164
We also get, and it fluctuates year to year, we get money from the office of community development for road repair and that could vary from

1279
02:07:50,193 --> 02:07:52,494
150,000 to 300,000 a year.

1280
02:07:53,034 --> 02:08:07,577
So you're looking at roughly $1.1 million a year allocation to improve our roads from the state and actually OCD, which comes from, I believe, the federal government.

1281
02:08:08,458 --> 02:08:11,538
The allocation amount is based on three different factors.

1282
02:08:12,539 --> 02:08:15,259
How many road miles do you have in your community?

1283
02:08:15,799 --> 02:08:17,320
That weighs in at a 58%

1284
02:08:20,430 --> 02:08:25,936
So it's very important how many road miles you have in your community when they allocate this money through Chapter 90.

1285
02:08:26,516 --> 02:08:31,642
Population is 20.83% of the formula.

1286
02:08:32,102 --> 02:08:35,666
So your population size weighs in on how much money you get back.

1287
02:08:36,857 --> 02:08:38,858
the employment within the community.

1288
02:08:38,878 --> 02:08:41,518
Do you have high or low employment in the community?

1289
02:08:41,978 --> 02:08:43,139
That weighs in also at 20.83%.

1290
02:08:45,299 --> 02:08:53,641
So all those three factors, uh, will, uh, be what determines how the state allocates this chapter 90 money.

1291
02:08:54,482 --> 02:08:55,202
And, uh, in 2018,

1292
02:08:57,146 --> 02:09:01,887
The governor is allocating $200 million for the entire state.

1293
02:09:02,768 --> 02:09:10,170
Our allocation for the city of Medford, based on the three factors, we have 91 miles of road in our community.

1294
02:09:10,690 --> 02:09:12,750
Our population is roughly 56,173.

1295
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:21,035
And our employment is about 18,474 in the community.

1296
02:09:21,536 --> 02:09:26,581
So based on those numbers, where we average with all the other communities, we're receiving 944,095.

1297
02:09:31,558 --> 02:09:32,118
in dollars.

1298
02:09:32,779 --> 02:09:34,659
Last year, we received $951,000.

1299
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:39,401
The prior year, FY16, $950,000.

1300
02:09:39,721 --> 02:09:43,083
So it's been very consistent over the years.

1301
02:09:43,103 --> 02:09:51,326
And we move forward, and we spend the money, and then we get reimbursed by the state through this Chapter 90 money.

1302
02:09:52,146 --> 02:09:54,227
The unfortunate thing about it, Mr. President,

1303
02:09:55,051 --> 02:09:57,393
is that's all we're putting towards the roads.

1304
02:09:57,873 --> 02:10:03,677
Whatever we get through Chapter 90, which is great, 100% reimbursement, sign me up every year.

1305
02:10:04,837 --> 02:10:06,058
But there's a problem with that.

1306
02:10:06,619 --> 02:10:09,080
It's great that we get it, but it's not enough.

1307
02:10:09,801 --> 02:10:11,242
And we've been doing this for years.

1308
02:10:12,022 --> 02:10:15,284
And we know that our roads have not improved over the years.

1309
02:10:15,825 --> 02:10:21,208
So it's clear to me, when you look at these figures, that we're never gonna get ahead of the game.

1310
02:10:21,228 --> 02:10:24,010
We're always gonna be chasing our tail on the roads.

1311
02:10:25,647 --> 02:10:30,330
We have 730 streets in the city of Method.

1312
02:10:30,350 --> 02:10:32,211
40% of them are private ways.

1313
02:10:32,691 --> 02:10:35,272
So we have 292 private ways.

1314
02:10:35,792 --> 02:10:38,694
Now most people will say, ha ha, I live on a private way.

1315
02:10:39,354 --> 02:10:39,835
Guess what?

1316
02:10:40,355 --> 02:10:44,977
There's no living on a private way.

1317
02:10:45,398 --> 02:10:49,960
It might be because in certain circumstances, you may have to pay for it.

1318
02:10:50,925 --> 02:10:53,748
You may have to pay to have a tree limb taken down.

1319
02:10:54,008 --> 02:10:57,791
You may have to pay to have a sidewalk done because you're on a private way.

1320
02:10:59,273 --> 02:11:06,780
Um, the rest of the roads, uh, and that's 60 a city streets.

1321
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:15,688
So I took a look at the numbers over the last four and a half, close to five years to try to get a picture on how many streets we doing per year.

1322
02:11:16,663 --> 02:11:18,846
And how much money are we getting from the state?

1323
02:11:19,226 --> 02:11:23,251
And at what point are we going to be able to complete our streets?

1324
02:11:23,271 --> 02:11:25,533
You know, we hear about complete streets all the time.

1325
02:11:26,014 --> 02:11:28,977
That's the biggest misnomer ever, complete streets.

1326
02:11:29,458 --> 02:11:29,698
We get 500,000.

1327
02:11:29,878 --> 02:11:33,522
We do a few small projects and we call it complete streets.

1328
02:11:34,403 --> 02:11:35,685
I don't know what they're completed, but.

1329
02:11:36,512 --> 02:11:37,292
That's what we call it.

1330
02:11:37,332 --> 02:11:46,596
So over the past four and a half years, we've paved altogether 30 streets in the city over four and a half years.

1331
02:11:46,896 --> 02:11:48,376
I like to round it off to five years.

1332
02:11:49,256 --> 02:11:56,759
Out of the 30 streets, nine were full streets where we ground the street down and repaved it.

1333
02:11:57,219 --> 02:12:00,080
So we did nine full streets in almost five years.

1334
02:12:00,720 --> 02:12:03,201
And the other 21 streets were partial.

1335
02:12:03,661 --> 02:12:05,002
They went up 500 yards on a road.

1336
02:12:06,295 --> 02:12:10,459
or they went from one intersection to the first intersection of the street.

1337
02:12:10,760 --> 02:12:11,941
So they weren't full streets.

1338
02:12:12,501 --> 02:12:18,848
But for my point, Mr. President, rather than trying to figure this out, I'm going to go based on the 30 streets.

1339
02:12:19,268 --> 02:12:22,511
So this city does 30 streets every five years.

1340
02:12:23,452 --> 02:12:24,033
So that's what?

1341
02:12:24,193 --> 02:12:26,735
Six streets a year, if you average it out.

1342
02:12:27,596 --> 02:12:29,698
A street grind and repave.

1343
02:12:30,508 --> 02:12:32,929
which we heard tonight in Committee of the Whole meeting.

1344
02:12:34,169 --> 02:12:51,016
The repaving is not lost, used to 2025, and that could be for increased traffic on a, trucking on a street, and pulling off the tie, which we heard from DPW tonight.

1345
02:12:51,696 --> 02:12:55,337
But a typical grind and pave, 15 times,

1346
02:12:58,422 --> 02:13:14,447
So if you take this and logically go through it, if we continue to pave the streets every five years, after 20 years, we will have of the 438 streets.

1347
02:13:14,467 --> 02:13:20,548
At that point of after five years, and then after 20 years,

1348
02:13:35,828 --> 02:13:37,449
We'll be working on 15 to 20.

1349
02:13:41,552 --> 02:13:46,716
This address any of the private roads I'm talking about.

1350
02:13:47,236 --> 02:13:56,103
So when you add in the other 300 roads, the figures that I'm coming up with are strictly only going based off the streets that I considered private, which is 438.

1351
02:13:59,088 --> 02:14:12,656
According to get out, Mr. President, we will never, ever in the way we're spending allocating money on our streets, we will never, ever get ahead on repaving our roads.

1352
02:14:13,157 --> 02:14:14,617
We are always going to be catching up.

1353
02:14:14,998 --> 02:14:17,899
We are always going to be doing our streets piecemeal.

1354
02:14:18,780 --> 02:14:26,825
I asked the city engineer's office, can you provide me with a list, a working list of the next priority of streets?

1355
02:14:28,059 --> 02:14:28,980
I could not get one.

1356
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:40,310
I could get a list of the 30 streets that were done over the past four and a half years, but I couldn't get a street listing of what the next priorities are.

1357
02:14:40,730 --> 02:14:50,058
And I think that's some of the frustration with feeling behind this reel when residents come up and say, you know, my street hasn't been looked at in six decades.

1358
02:14:51,219 --> 02:14:52,120
Six decades.

1359
02:14:53,341 --> 02:14:55,483
So, Mr. President, it's clear to me

1360
02:14:56,604 --> 02:15:16,250
In order to get ahead of the curve, we as a city can take advantage of the Chapter 90 money and the reimbursement, but we also have to put money, allocate money in our budget every year in DPW or engineering, specifically for road repavement, Mr. President.

1361
02:15:17,471 --> 02:15:21,512
And if we allocate an additional million dollars in that year,

1362
02:15:22,863 --> 02:15:31,951
We go up from 28% of the streets that are being done in five years to 52% or 54%, whatever the math comes out to.

1363
02:15:33,433 --> 02:15:38,678
It has that much of an impact, adding another million dollars a year to our roads.

1364
02:15:40,304 --> 02:15:54,797
So, you know, knowing it's the top, in my opinion, one of the top three priorities in this community, knowing that we're never going to get ahead from previous experience on the money we're receiving, that we need to do this, Mr. President.

1365
02:15:55,198 --> 02:16:03,185
We as a council, during this year's budget, I'm sure other councils have other priorities, traffic engineer and a lot of other issues out there.

1366
02:16:03,568 --> 02:16:18,144
But we as a council have to stand up as a body and say, you know what, based on the complaints we get, based on the poor condition of our streets, based on a number of issues, Madam Mayor, we need you to add an additional $1 million

1367
02:16:19,770 --> 02:16:20,931
$2 million would be even better.

1368
02:16:21,151 --> 02:16:23,253
That'd be 75% of our roads.

1369
02:16:23,274 --> 02:16:33,143
$3 million would be a panacea and bring us to a target level of completing all our streets after a certain number of years.

1370
02:16:34,124 --> 02:16:39,809
That may not be realistic, Mr. President, but I think at least putting an additional million dollars.

1371
02:16:40,710 --> 02:16:48,917
Now we can all talk a big game when the residents come up, and we can sympathize, and we can cry crocodile tears when they come up and say, oh my God, that's awful.

1372
02:16:49,538 --> 02:16:52,661
But we have to do something as a council, Mr. President.

1373
02:16:52,921 --> 02:16:55,443
We have to stand up and take action.

1374
02:16:56,424 --> 02:16:57,905
And this is the only way it's gonna happen.

1375
02:16:58,126 --> 02:17:02,529
Have you ever heard anyone from the city administration step up and say, we need more money for the roads?

1376
02:17:03,590 --> 02:17:05,112
Absolutely not, Mr. President.

1377
02:17:06,090 --> 02:17:19,838
I've been on this council 16 years, Mr. President, and I've never heard one person from DPW, engineering, or the city administration ever step up and say, you know what, based on the poor condition of our roads, we need some additional funding.

1378
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:30,405
I received a number of pitches via email because this was on the agenda and the street

1379
02:17:35,456 --> 02:17:36,057
that are sinking.

1380
02:17:36,357 --> 02:17:43,184
By the way, the Chapter 9 money is used not just to repave, it's used for infrastructure improvements.

1381
02:17:43,744 --> 02:17:49,189
So if you have a catch basin that's sinking, that money can be used to rebuild the catch basin.

1382
02:17:50,370 --> 02:17:56,897
If you have a manhole cover that's sinking or has potholes all around it, that could be used to fix the manhole cover.

1383
02:17:57,525 --> 02:18:03,870
You have curbing that's level with the street now, like Riverside Ave, that I've been complaining about, Mr. President.

1384
02:18:04,691 --> 02:18:07,954
When you drive down Riverside Ave, the curbing is level with the road.

1385
02:18:08,874 --> 02:18:09,935
How unsafe is that?

1386
02:18:12,097 --> 02:18:17,902
So these are the infrastructure improvements, Mr. President, along with sidewalks as well, that can be done with this money.

1387
02:18:18,763 --> 02:18:21,285
And in my opinion, it's long overdue.

1388
02:18:21,645 --> 02:18:25,028
It's a top issue in this community, public safety and roads.

1389
02:18:25,772 --> 02:18:30,914
And, uh, we need to address it, Mr. President, just to give people an idea what it costs.

1390
02:18:31,634 --> 02:18:37,216
Um, Stearns Ave in South Method had their road repaved not too long ago.

1391
02:18:38,176 --> 02:18:39,857
Um, I think it was back in 2013.

1392
02:18:41,737 --> 02:18:43,118
It was a few years back.

1393
02:18:43,878 --> 02:18:49,100
And that street, which probably has maybe 12 homes the length of the street,

1394
02:18:49,453 --> 02:18:56,996
maybe 13, cost the city $85,000 for full grind and a repave.

1395
02:18:58,256 --> 02:19:08,920
So I think it puts it in perspective, knowing the size of that street and comparing it to other streets that, you know, we can get through a lot of streets if we put the money towards it.

1396
02:19:09,540 --> 02:19:15,682
We can accomplish our goals if we're able, Mr. President, to make this a priority, which it should be.

1397
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:20,362
You shouldn't have to use radar when you're running down the streets.

1398
02:19:21,703 --> 02:19:23,905
I come down the streets, I know exactly where the potholes are.

1399
02:19:24,165 --> 02:19:26,527
I go like that, I drive, I know exactly where they are.

1400
02:19:26,847 --> 02:19:32,071
I know where the manhole covers are too low, I know where all the bumps are, and it's a shame, Mr. President.

1401
02:19:32,371 --> 02:19:38,555
That shows you how long that our roads have been inflicted with these ripples and potholes.

1402
02:19:39,336 --> 02:19:43,779
So I would respectfully ask my colleagues, Mr. President, on a vote tonight,

1403
02:19:44,350 --> 02:19:55,142
To ask the mayor, I know we just received some of our budget and we got our budget book and we're going to start meeting with department heads, that this is in the early stages of the budget.

1404
02:19:55,422 --> 02:20:00,488
We haven't sat down at all yet that a million dollars be appropriated, Mr. President.

1405
02:20:00,908 --> 02:20:10,836
towards the repaving of our roads and that we also have a systematic approach on priorities of roads that need to be repaired.

1406
02:20:11,277 --> 02:20:16,301
So we don't have to go to the engineering office and say, well, we really don't have a list.

1407
02:20:16,941 --> 02:20:19,623
It's done by calls that we receive.

1408
02:20:19,643 --> 02:20:21,345
Then we go out and look at them.

1409
02:20:21,405 --> 02:20:25,288
And then if the mayor wants to do them, we get them done.

1410
02:20:26,730 --> 02:20:28,832
You know, there's really no list, Mr. President.

1411
02:20:29,093 --> 02:20:40,228
There should be a list on the city website that any resident can go there and see if they're on the priority list, see where their street falls, and expect the date that their street may be done, Mr. President.

1412
02:20:40,909 --> 02:20:42,131
This is not rocket science.

1413
02:20:43,743 --> 02:20:51,888
And again, as I preference my remarks all the time, this is no reflection on a depleted DPW department.

1414
02:20:52,548 --> 02:20:56,091
It's no reflection on the good work that they do, Mr. President.

1415
02:20:56,511 --> 02:21:08,298
But clearly, you know, from past experience and from past knowledge that we're going nowhere, how we're currently operating with repaving our streets.

1416
02:21:08,618 --> 02:21:11,520
And I offer this, Mr. President, as a way to

1417
02:21:12,781 --> 02:21:25,629
have an approach that can address one of the top concerns from residents that contact me, phone me, email me, stop me at stop and shop or wherever else I am about the condition of our roads.

1418
02:21:25,989 --> 02:21:38,078
So I would ask that in a formal vote tonight, Mr. President, that we request the mayor put an additional million dollars in the paving budget for either DPW or engineering.

1419
02:21:38,918 --> 02:21:39,859
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1420
02:21:41,930 --> 02:22:06,132
Mr. President, several months ago this council voted on a resolution that I sponsored requesting that the DPW perform a complete assessment of our streets and the resolution requested that they consider adopting new technology and right now there is an opportunity for the City of Medford to utilize infrared technology and it pretty much is a truck that drives down the street and takes an x-ray of the road and uses infrared technology to determine

1421
02:22:07,107 --> 02:22:11,788
the quality of the infrastructure below the ground, as well as the defects of the infrastructure above the ground, Mr. President.

1422
02:22:12,948 --> 02:22:15,629
I've had the opportunity to take a look at one of these machines.

1423
02:22:15,649 --> 02:22:23,430
A local business on Mystic Avenue, Millennium Power Sweeping, is in possession of one, and this tool can work miracles.

1424
02:22:24,050 --> 02:22:32,112
It can repair potholes and do a whole entire assessment of the roadway all in one felt swoop, Mr. President.

1425
02:22:33,183 --> 02:22:35,644
I certainly think that this is a noble resolution.

1426
02:22:37,325 --> 02:22:39,566
I don't know if a million bucks is going to be enough, Mr. President.

1427
02:22:40,246 --> 02:22:41,107
I don't think not.

1428
02:22:41,407 --> 02:22:45,469
If we're going to be putting out a budget, we're looking to add $1 million to it.

1429
02:22:45,489 --> 02:22:46,829
This budget is funded by ________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1430
02:23:06,094 --> 02:23:25,203
However, I would like to include in this resolution an amendment asking that, number one, the infrared technology be utilized, and number two, I think that it's important that the public be informed.

1431
02:23:26,442 --> 02:23:29,103
maybe do a trial run with the truck?

1432
02:23:29,763 --> 02:23:32,304
I do believe that they've done that already, Mr. President.

1433
02:23:32,444 --> 02:23:44,287
And I think that Melanie might have been utilized to do a test run, performing repairs to some cracks on some basketball courts to show how far along technology's come.

1434
02:23:45,227 --> 02:23:49,708
So I certainly don't have a problem asking for a complete assessment.

1435
02:23:49,768 --> 02:23:53,849
I think it's premature to request funding until we get the assessment done, because we really don't know what it's going to cost.

1436
02:23:53,909 --> 02:23:55,810
I think Councillor Marks has done a great job putting this

1437
02:23:56,383 --> 02:24:01,776
I would like an opportunity to review the numbers a little further.

1438
02:24:02,257 --> 02:24:05,846
I did get a response from the administration that it would cost about $7 million to

1439
02:24:06,663 --> 02:24:09,144
We can pave our emergency arteries in their entirety.

1440
02:24:09,604 --> 02:24:15,147
And the question comes is whether or not we can use tax agent money to do that or if there are other funding sources that are available to us as well.

1441
02:24:15,207 --> 02:24:23,331
So I certainly can appreciate the resolution, however, for us right now to add a million dollars to the proposed budget I think is premature.

1442
02:24:23,371 --> 02:24:27,173
I think we should start a budget discussions and deliberations and find out where money's going.

1443
02:24:28,493 --> 02:24:30,795
Based on last year's fiscal year budget, I think we have close to 605.

1444
02:24:32,266 --> 02:24:43,213
$100,000 of money that's used for contracted services, for services that could be performed in-house that's being performed out-house, for services that could go towards paying for salaries to replete the DPW staff.

1445
02:24:43,233 --> 02:24:48,556
So there's a number of items that we need to look at, Mr. President, and this is a priority, but there are other priorities as well, as the Councillor noted.

1446
02:24:49,236 --> 02:24:52,318
So I can certainly stand behind the resolution to ask for the assessment.

1447
02:24:53,099 --> 02:24:59,042
However, at this point in time, I'd feel very uncomfortable requesting that $1 million be added to the budget without further discussion to liberation and investigation.

1448
02:25:00,838 --> 02:25:02,780
Point of information of Vice President Marks.

1449
02:25:03,340 --> 02:25:06,483
The councilor mentioned that he asked for the assessment back several months.

1450
02:25:06,543 --> 02:25:08,204
Did we get a copy of the assessment?

1451
02:25:08,845 --> 02:25:09,765
I believe we got it.

1452
02:25:11,046 --> 02:25:12,367
We were supposed to get it on the 31st.

1453
02:25:12,407 --> 02:25:13,969
We haven't got it yet according to the meeting.

1454
02:25:14,009 --> 02:25:16,671
So we haven't got anything based on the resolution you offered.

1455
02:25:17,051 --> 02:25:20,254
I believe we got a response saying that they'll look into it.

1456
02:25:20,294 --> 02:25:20,754
Yeah.

1457
02:25:20,774 --> 02:25:20,974
Right.

1458
02:25:21,074 --> 02:25:22,536
So we haven't got anything back.

1459
02:25:22,676 --> 02:25:22,816
So.

1460
02:25:23,672 --> 02:25:34,162
In my opinion, we can ask again, which is great, I have no problem asking again, but I think people are tired of hearing about the ask and want to see action.

1461
02:25:35,083 --> 02:25:41,549
I think asking for a million dollars in the budget is action, Mr. President, that will result in the repaving of streets.

1462
02:25:42,230 --> 02:25:43,891
and not just a proposal.

1463
02:25:44,671 --> 02:25:54,977
I agree and I voted for the x-raying of streets and so forth, but I haven't seen a response back, so I'm not gonna put too much credibility into that.

1464
02:25:55,658 --> 02:25:56,698
I'd rather see some action.

1465
02:25:57,078 --> 02:26:00,540
Mr. President, we do have money that's already appropriated for the paving of Evans Street and Harris Street.

1466
02:26:00,560 --> 02:26:02,281
I don't think we've seen that happen either, and the money's there.

1467
02:26:04,923 --> 02:26:05,523
Thank you.

1468
02:26:09,175 --> 02:26:10,395
Name and address of the record, please.

1469
02:26:10,815 --> 02:26:11,296
Good evening.

1470
02:26:11,316 --> 02:26:18,878
I want to thank the council vice president for bringing this very important issue up.

1471
02:26:19,338 --> 02:26:28,121
If you drive on route 60, right at the park street, there is a trolley track or a train track exposed in the road.

1472
02:26:28,521 --> 02:26:36,043
Now, a couple of years back, in front of the littlest laundromat, which is diagonal to that, the street literally caved in, a big chunk

1473
02:26:36,978 --> 02:26:38,299
the street caved in.

1474
02:26:38,799 --> 02:26:51,886
I don't know what's under Salem street but we do know that people from out of town use exit 32 as a speedway to get to Malden and Revere because they don't want to go route 16 which has about double the lights.

1475
02:26:52,266 --> 02:26:54,187
I've counted them as I've encountered both roads.

1476
02:26:54,987 --> 02:26:59,170
It's about double the lights on route 16 and imagine what happens when the casino comes in.

1477
02:26:59,510 --> 02:27:02,551
So they use route 60 which I don't think is a federal road.

1478
02:27:02,591 --> 02:27:03,392
I think it's a Medford

1479
02:27:04,298 --> 02:27:07,959
The crosswalks are abysmal right now, again, and they were painted last year.

1480
02:27:08,379 --> 02:27:11,000
So last summer they were painted, this summer they're fading.

1481
02:27:11,680 --> 02:27:19,003
Tonight, both sides, they weren't going 20 miles an hour, which is the road, that's the speed limit.

1482
02:27:19,763 --> 02:27:21,804
One car had to be going 55 miles an hour.

1483
02:27:21,864 --> 02:27:23,244
They just fly by.

1484
02:27:23,825 --> 02:27:29,526
And Councilor De La Russo had noted that he agreed Route 60 is a mess.

1485
02:27:29,987 --> 02:27:34,108
So you have our infrastructure, you have the streets like this, you have people coming from out of town,

1486
02:27:35,292 --> 02:27:51,319
And we have this, this mess that's on this main dragway, which is route 60 public access TV, of course could expose a lot more of this, but I just want this council to be aware that there's, there's, you know, speed bumps aren't going to help and we can't put too many lights in, but there is a problem.

1487
02:27:51,499 --> 02:27:58,302
And I'm wondering if any counselor knows how many times the city has been sued over broken roads, that's something to consider as well.

1488
02:27:58,702 --> 02:28:03,845
So if we're getting sued over broken roads, if people are coming from out of town and zipping down 60,

1489
02:28:04,869 --> 02:28:09,950
Is that expense, could that be offset by paving that road in particular?

1490
02:28:10,571 --> 02:28:10,931
Thank you.

1491
02:28:11,731 --> 02:28:12,071
Thank you.

1492
02:28:12,091 --> 02:28:13,931
Name and address of the record, please.

1493
02:28:14,412 --> 02:28:16,812
Jean Muzo, 35 Paris Street.

1494
02:28:17,532 --> 02:28:23,294
The last time we spoke about potholes, I told you all that I didn't know the last time Paris Street was paved.

1495
02:28:23,594 --> 02:28:30,836
Someone reached out and advised me that the last time Paris Street was paved, they watched it from the window of the Curtis School.

1496
02:28:31,377 --> 02:28:33,638
as beetle mania hit the United States in 1964.

1497
02:28:34,118 --> 02:28:37,000
So that's the last time Paris street was paved.

1498
02:28:37,380 --> 02:28:44,684
So I'm not surprised to hear that within the next century we may only see another 50 of Medford's roads attended to.

1499
02:28:44,704 --> 02:28:48,686
I find it interesting that 30 roads have been done.

1500
02:28:49,086 --> 02:28:54,309
And through the chair, I'd be curious to know if a single one on the north side of Medford has been done.

1501
02:28:54,729 --> 02:28:59,652
Because I have said repeatedly that our side of the city has really seen

1502
02:29:00,442 --> 02:29:01,822
No attention whatsoever.

1503
02:29:02,482 --> 02:29:04,663
Not roads, not sidewalks.

1504
02:29:05,263 --> 02:29:19,845
But it sounds like maybe that's not a bad thing based upon the committee of the whole meeting tonight that we heard about the poor quality of the hot top and asphalt that is coming out probably for any number of reasons.

1505
02:29:19,966 --> 02:29:22,906
But 1964 was the last time Parry Street was paved.

1506
02:29:23,666 --> 02:29:27,787
And we have not really had our potholes attended to.

1507
02:29:29,055 --> 02:29:36,319
I would love to see some additional funding put towards this and I don't want to be greedy.

1508
02:29:36,619 --> 02:29:49,806
I would even be happy with key cut properly filled potholes rather than potholes that have some attention given to them as a band aid for the short term.

1509
02:29:49,866 --> 02:29:57,910
I think many people might say to spread that across a little bit more and have equitable

1510
02:29:58,692 --> 02:30:03,054
repair those potholes that are causing the most damage, you know.

1511
02:30:04,295 --> 02:30:06,796
It doesn't all have to be in one place, certainly.

1512
02:30:06,936 --> 02:30:12,379
But, you know, again, 1964 was the last time our street saw any attention.

1513
02:30:12,919 --> 02:30:13,199
Thank you.

1514
02:30:13,219 --> 02:30:13,520
Thank you.

1515
02:30:14,320 --> 02:30:16,961
Name and address of the record, please.

1516
02:30:17,462 --> 02:30:18,582
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1517
02:30:18,642 --> 02:30:19,843
I live at 281 Park Street.

1518
02:30:20,483 --> 02:30:25,906
Our street was the fortunate benefactor of about 13 years ago we actually did get our street paid.

1519
02:30:26,006 --> 02:30:26,626
So yay us.

1520
02:30:27,046 --> 02:30:28,167
We have the school on our street.

1521
02:30:28,463 --> 02:30:29,923
So I'm very happy about that.

1522
02:30:30,003 --> 02:30:41,767
But I really hope that a million dollars is put into the budget for street paving because it's nice to have ribbon cuttings, it's nice to add nice to have to the city and beautiful parks and things but we need the roads.

1523
02:30:42,087 --> 02:30:44,028
The roads are what we use every single day.

1524
02:30:44,528 --> 02:30:47,649
Every citizen in Medford wants the roads being repaired.

1525
02:30:49,829 --> 02:30:57,432
They did have the cutouts done on their street but they ran out of the asphalt halfway down and the rest of the street wasn't repaired properly.

1526
02:30:58,864 --> 02:30:59,944
and serious disrepair.

1527
02:31:00,305 --> 02:31:07,127
And anyone who knows any street, you know, they're off in the heights yesterday and I couldn't believe some of them.

1528
02:31:08,127 --> 02:31:11,649
I was actually speaking to people earlier that it's like the surface.

1529
02:31:12,509 --> 02:31:15,110
So I really hope that some attention is given to our roads.

1530
02:31:15,130 --> 02:31:16,570
This is a quality of life issue.

1531
02:31:17,251 --> 02:31:17,611
Thank you.

1532
02:31:17,631 --> 02:31:19,531
Thank you.

1533
02:31:19,571 --> 02:31:20,752
Name and address of the record, please.

1534
02:31:21,192 --> 02:31:22,192
Thank you, Mr. President.

1535
02:31:25,625 --> 02:31:28,986
I want to thank vice president Marks for bringing this up tonight.

1536
02:31:29,006 --> 02:31:32,366
I don't know how many times I've been up here speaking about Evans street.

1537
02:31:33,107 --> 02:31:44,669
With all due respect, I respect the intentions of bringing in technology to look at the roads but as Councillor Marks said, he's gotten what, how many pictures came in?

1538
02:31:45,209 --> 02:31:50,070
I think we know what the conditions of the roads and streets are.

1539
02:31:50,690 --> 02:31:53,551
To try to make it a little bit bigger of a picture,

1540
02:31:55,352 --> 02:32:00,116
These kind of improvements go towards growing our community.

1541
02:32:01,577 --> 02:32:04,200
I want more people to move and live in Medford.

1542
02:32:04,540 --> 02:32:14,508
I mean, with the problems we're having with airplanes and everything else, more improvement on parks, which has actually been excellent in the last year and a half, I have to say.

1543
02:32:15,029 --> 02:32:16,530
The park improvements have been good.

1544
02:32:16,950 --> 02:32:18,592
But if we add this million dollars,

1545
02:32:19,583 --> 02:32:29,693
To further improve our city and make it aesthetically pleasing and get more people to move here To make our community stronger.

1546
02:32:30,073 --> 02:32:39,161
I think it would be great and to make it a zero-sum game I know the council is in the administration and a lot of people don't want to hear this but perhaps a 20% reduction

1547
02:32:40,435 --> 02:32:54,046
in certain pay grades might help to offset certain costs so that we can make these improvements to make our city a much better place to live in, move to, raise a family and improve our schools.

1548
02:32:54,507 --> 02:33:01,052
I mean, the facade at Medford high school I think is still in need of a million dollar repair.

1549
02:33:01,072 --> 02:33:02,193
It's a figure that I heard.

1550
02:33:02,213 --> 02:33:03,634
I could be speaking out of turn.

1551
02:33:03,694 --> 02:33:05,236
I don't know that exactly.

1552
02:33:05,296 --> 02:33:07,237
But I do know it does need repairs.

1553
02:33:08,931 --> 02:33:19,670
In moving forward, I would hope that when you look at this budget that you're going to debate, we look into certain areas because I took a look at it before coming up here.

1554
02:33:20,220 --> 02:33:44,173
You know, to see millions of dollars in the pay grades and having to beg for a necessity like streets and roads kind of makes no sense to the people that are at home watching, seeing their water tax go up, their property taxes go up every year, a surcharge on the property tax, the excise taxes that I think are specifically supposed to be used for street and road improvements.

1555
02:33:44,233 --> 02:33:45,833
And what are we getting for it?

1556
02:33:46,314 --> 02:33:48,535
A city councilor who has to bring up again

1557
02:33:49,079 --> 02:33:56,485
for how many years now, a simple thing like fixing the streets and roads to make Medford strong.

1558
02:33:57,205 --> 02:33:58,766
Take that slogan off of a t-shirt.

1559
02:33:59,127 --> 02:34:00,268
Let's put it into reality.

1560
02:34:00,408 --> 02:34:01,328
Thank you, Mr. President.

1561
02:34:01,649 --> 02:34:02,109
Thank you.

1562
02:34:02,269 --> 02:34:06,873
On the motion.

1563
02:34:08,794 --> 02:34:09,995
Name and address of the record, please.

1564
02:34:10,135 --> 02:34:12,417
Nathan Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave, Medford, Mass.

1565
02:34:13,177 --> 02:34:16,879
Thank you, Councillor and vice president for bringing up this issue.

1566
02:34:17,279 --> 02:34:23,061
And as a resident on Riverside ave, I can personally attest that the curbs are very low.

1567
02:34:23,141 --> 02:34:33,406
Back in 2014 in October, a car drove through my front yard, took out my fence and hit the steps at what was the building on the corner of Riverside and locus.

1568
02:34:34,326 --> 02:34:35,747
So there is a need.

1569
02:34:37,208 --> 02:34:42,490
Also for the record, I'm sure you're all aware that Wegmans is going to be open soon.

1570
02:34:43,130 --> 02:34:54,116
So in terms of prioritization, maybe when these big projects are happening and you know that, hey, a place like that's going to open, if you're going to choose to repair roads, it may be a good time to do that and a bad time.

1571
02:34:54,916 --> 02:35:00,259
You just talked a lot about the inconvenience on Boston Ave, you know, to the residents there.

1572
02:35:00,379 --> 02:35:03,120
Well, what do you think is going to happen when Wegmans opens up?

1573
02:35:03,160 --> 02:35:06,762
There won't be a good time to fix Riverside Ave for a very long time.

1574
02:35:08,243 --> 02:35:10,784
Finally, as far as how to come up with a million dollars,

1575
02:35:11,715 --> 02:35:22,142
So I see that, and I know this is kind of furthering business, but the city is looking to raise $1 million ahead of time from our water bills.

1576
02:35:22,162 --> 02:35:24,663
It's a notice I got in the mail the other day.

1577
02:35:26,104 --> 02:35:27,285
We can come up with a million bucks.

1578
02:35:28,906 --> 02:35:33,889
Mayor Burke is also asking for what, 900K for a leak detection system.

1579
02:35:35,931 --> 02:35:36,731
That's a million dollars.

1580
02:35:37,112 --> 02:35:39,253
So you could say no to that and there's a million bucks.

1581
02:35:40,374 --> 02:35:40,634
Thank you.

1582
02:35:41,491 --> 02:35:41,851
Thank you.

1583
02:35:45,432 --> 02:35:58,735
On, on the motion by councilor, vice-president Mox seconded by motion by councilor night to sever name and address for the record, please.

1584
02:35:59,235 --> 02:36:09,658
This gentleman brought up a corner location where a car went through his fence and onto the corner location.

1585
02:36:09,738 --> 02:36:11,178
I believe it was called re max.

1586
02:36:13,331 --> 02:36:26,500
It's also my memory, I believe Councilor Penta had said that we should have used money to buy that corner piece of real estate when it was for sale.

1587
02:36:27,861 --> 02:36:33,365
Especially now with more tractor trailers trying to navigate that turn.

1588
02:36:34,586 --> 02:36:35,526
Very dangerous.

1589
02:36:35,987 --> 02:36:39,029
In hindsight, I believe the gentleman was right in the past.

1590
02:36:41,331 --> 02:36:41,711
Thank you.

1591
02:36:43,147 --> 02:36:47,249
on the motion that asked to be severed by Councillor Knight.

1592
02:36:48,509 --> 02:36:49,589
Councillor Karygiannis.

1593
02:36:50,570 --> 02:36:50,930
Thank you.

1594
02:36:50,950 --> 02:36:52,710
I'll be brief.

1595
02:36:52,750 --> 02:36:56,992
I think we are very frustrated with the state of our roads.

1596
02:36:57,252 --> 02:36:59,493
I've voiced my opinion the last several weeks.

1597
02:37:00,553 --> 02:37:07,656
Luckily we did have a meeting with the DPW director and head of DPW this evening and

1598
02:37:08,741 --> 02:37:09,982
It is discouraging.

1599
02:37:10,102 --> 02:37:19,165
The crews are out there, they sit on a daily basis working to repair our roads and fix potholes and try to fix manhole covers.

1600
02:37:19,365 --> 02:37:21,046
I see the patches all over the place.

1601
02:37:21,566 --> 02:37:32,531
And the complaints from what I understand are 60 recent complaints on see, click, fix just for potholes.

1602
02:37:33,271 --> 02:37:34,992
And I specifically asked, are we

1603
02:37:35,862 --> 02:37:39,264
Are we working just with regards to the potholes on complaint basis?

1604
02:37:39,385 --> 02:37:41,746
And that's the state that we're in.

1605
02:37:42,427 --> 02:37:45,369
We're understaffed and we're working just on complaints.

1606
02:37:45,829 --> 02:37:49,832
Now, there are potholes and problems all over our streets.

1607
02:37:50,312 --> 02:37:55,516
And to go into Evans street and Paris street, there's many other roads that need resurfacing.

1608
02:37:55,596 --> 02:38:01,400
So I think what we're hearing tonight is we have a budget to review and a request for a million dollars.

1609
02:38:02,370 --> 02:38:05,612
that comes from frustration, and I, too, am very frustrated.

1610
02:38:05,712 --> 02:38:20,783
So whether it's a million dollars or half a million or even just a plan to be put in place that we're doing more than five streets a year from what I understand through Council Mark's research, we need more.

1611
02:38:21,003 --> 02:38:24,886
We need to have more in this budget, and there are places that you can trim.

1612
02:38:25,526 --> 02:38:27,508
There are a number of different things that can be done.

1613
02:38:27,608 --> 02:38:29,369
We have $9 million in free cash.

1614
02:38:31,448 --> 02:38:38,351
committing every year to put more than $950,000 into repaving and fixing our streets.

1615
02:38:38,491 --> 02:38:39,612
And that's the bottom line.

1616
02:38:40,352 --> 02:38:51,278
So whether we vote for a million tonight or we discuss it at budget time, I'm in support of putting more than what chapter 90 funds allows us to put into our streets.

1617
02:38:51,498 --> 02:38:55,660
We as a city are taxing our residents on every level.

1618
02:38:56,220 --> 02:38:59,782
We need to be able to give them a safe, proper place to drive.

1619
02:39:01,584 --> 02:39:17,793
That is the bottom line, and I appreciate the resolution and see where it goes, but the bottom line is we need to dedicate more time, whether that's hiring more manpower, buying more fill, things need to be done that are not being done now.

1620
02:39:18,434 --> 02:39:18,794
Thank you.

1621
02:39:19,414 --> 02:39:21,175
Councilor Scarpelli.

1622
02:39:21,515 --> 02:39:22,456
Thank you, Mr. President.

1623
02:39:22,936 --> 02:39:27,579
I appreciate Councilor Moxley bringing this up because it is the number one concern we have in our community.

1624
02:39:30,163 --> 02:39:40,966
In a daily basis, I think that most communities don't go to the city council meetings and put potholes on their agenda.

1625
02:39:41,486 --> 02:39:43,406
So I feel for that.

1626
02:39:43,786 --> 02:39:54,189
But I think that going through the budget and being fiscally responsible to what we see, because I don't want to be in a position where

1627
02:39:55,449 --> 02:40:02,132
we're being held accountable for losing other city necessities.

1628
02:40:02,392 --> 02:40:05,533
So I think it's important that the budget season comes up.

1629
02:40:06,034 --> 02:40:19,019
I'm supporting Council Marks, his process that during the budget time, I will stand by him with the million or more and looking into other avenues as free cash.

1630
02:40:20,300 --> 02:40:25,222
But until we have that budget meeting, I think it's important that we hear

1631
02:40:25,810 --> 02:40:27,391
what is upon us in the next week.

1632
02:40:27,671 --> 02:40:48,398
I know that, uh, Saturday, I believe, uh, is going to be a very interesting day and long day, but it's going to be, uh, it's going to be something that I think all of us have heard and all of us sitting at a table would really stress the fact that streets and our roads are going to be on number one, one of our number one priority.

1633
02:40:48,458 --> 02:40:49,298
So thank you.

1634
02:40:50,379 --> 02:40:51,059
Counselor box.

1635
02:40:51,439 --> 02:40:52,399
Thank you, Mr. President.

1636
02:40:52,419 --> 02:40:54,520
I appreciate my colleagues, uh, comments.

1637
02:40:55,596 --> 02:40:59,899
Let's remember, this council cannot add to the city budget.

1638
02:41:00,839 --> 02:41:14,066
This is a request by the council based on years of previous experience that we can't continue to operate the way we're doing business and expect our roads to get completed, Mr. President.

1639
02:41:14,486 --> 02:41:17,548
That's all this is to open up dialogue and discussion.

1640
02:41:17,968 --> 02:41:21,210
So don't be hell-bent on, oh, a million dollars.

1641
02:41:22,187 --> 02:41:28,709
It's to open up discussion and dialogue and to let the mayor know that there's a need in this community, Mr. President.

1642
02:41:29,049 --> 02:41:31,970
You know, Councilor Langel-Kern talked about we have $8,239,000 in free cash.

1643
02:41:32,010 --> 02:41:33,190
That could be used for roads, Mr. President.

1644
02:41:41,222 --> 02:41:42,443
We have linkage money.

1645
02:41:43,184 --> 02:41:59,680
We're one of just a few communities in the entire state that when development comes in over a certain size, whether it's a rehab or new development, we charge a certain percentage to linkage for infrastructure improvements, like the gentleman that lives on Riverside Ave said.

1646
02:42:00,628 --> 02:42:16,246
Wouldn't that be a novelty, you know, when Wegmans comes in, because they're going to pay linkage to this community, that a certain percent goes to the infrastructure around that particular area to improve access and to improve pedestrian safety, Mr. President?

1647
02:42:16,807 --> 02:42:19,547
So there's plenty of money available.

1648
02:42:20,268 --> 02:42:24,708
So don't get caught up on whether or not a million dollars and we're going to have to cut something.

1649
02:42:24,728 --> 02:42:26,089
No, we're not talking about cuts at all.

1650
02:42:26,449 --> 02:42:37,170
We want to present this to the mayor saying, Madam Mayor, whether it's through linkage, free certified, free cash, or any other venue that you can think of, we need to do a better job.

1651
02:42:37,611 --> 02:42:46,132
And as I mentioned earlier, the $950,000 we receive every year in Chapter 90 money is just not footing the bill in this community.

1652
02:42:46,595 --> 02:42:48,735
And it's evident, it's evident.

1653
02:42:49,076 --> 02:42:57,537
These streets are the worst I've seen in my, I don't want to date myself now, but I've been driving 30 years on these streets, Mr. President.

1654
02:42:58,558 --> 02:42:59,978
And they're the worst I've ever seen.

1655
02:42:59,998 --> 02:43:04,179
There's a problem and it exists and we have to address it.

1656
02:43:04,879 --> 02:43:08,800
And we can ask for all the reports and all the different studies, but you know what?

1657
02:43:09,883 --> 02:43:11,084
Let's take some action.

1658
02:43:11,484 --> 02:43:12,825
Let's put money in the budget.

1659
02:43:13,025 --> 02:43:16,208
Let's get money out of certified free cash and move forward.

1660
02:43:16,468 --> 02:43:19,871
Let's get a list of priorities and start moving forward on these streets.

1661
02:43:20,291 --> 02:43:25,895
And rather than see six a year, Mr. President, let's look at 15 to 20 streets a year.

1662
02:43:27,096 --> 02:43:30,519
Then we'll make some headway and get ahead of ourselves, Mr. President.

1663
02:43:31,179 --> 02:43:33,181
So that's why it was offered tonight, Mr. President.

1664
02:43:33,421 --> 02:43:35,042
I'm not asking anyone behind this real,

1665
02:43:35,364 --> 02:43:39,026
to make decisions tonight on cutting out something within the budget.

1666
02:43:39,266 --> 02:43:42,588
No, this is to start discussion and dialogue.

1667
02:43:43,028 --> 02:43:49,431
This, in my opinion, is warranted, and I have the proof.

1668
02:43:49,791 --> 02:44:03,078
I'll send my council colleagues the emails I've received from pitches around the community, and I ask Mr. President for support of this tonight, to send a message, a shot across the bow,

1669
02:44:03,835 --> 02:44:10,058
and to let her know that we're serious about this and it's not going to just be another rubber stamp on the FY 18 budget.

1670
02:44:11,038 --> 02:44:13,359
This council wants some action and some results.

1671
02:44:13,399 --> 02:44:20,642
Mr. President, you yourself said we've had more community, the whole meetings and subcommittee meetings and push more new ordinances forward.

1672
02:44:21,343 --> 02:44:24,924
That's also get some results when it comes to infrastructure in this community.

1673
02:44:25,465 --> 02:44:26,565
Thank you, Mr. Vice president.

1674
02:44:27,626 --> 02:44:28,506
Councilor Falco.

1675
02:44:28,866 --> 02:44:29,406
Thank you.

1676
02:44:29,446 --> 02:44:30,267
Thank you, Mr. President.

1677
02:44:30,307 --> 02:44:33,148
I'd also like to thank councilor marks for bringing this resolution forward.

1678
02:44:33,807 --> 02:44:38,108
I think it's important to open the dialogue and talk about issues like this.

1679
02:44:38,568 --> 02:44:43,809
This is an issue that impacts every neighbourhood throughout the city.

1680
02:44:44,529 --> 02:44:47,530
The roads are in terrible condition.

1681
02:44:47,590 --> 02:44:52,391
Not all the roads but a great percentage are in pretty bad shape.

1682
02:44:52,871 --> 02:44:57,972
I definitely would support an audit on the roads in prioritizing

1683
02:45:00,195 --> 02:45:03,877
reconstructing some of the roads, resurfacing some of the roads.

1684
02:45:04,357 --> 02:45:21,185
I also believe that, you know, the states, if we're getting money from getting chapter 90 funding for, you know, rehabilitating the roads and if we're getting funding from some funding from the federal government through OCD funds, you know, we probably should be actually taking some money.

1685
02:45:22,060 --> 02:45:26,082
from the city, you know, we should probably take a look to see if there is any money in available accounts.

1686
02:45:26,482 --> 02:45:29,103
To put it towards the roads, we should be investing in ourselves.

1687
02:45:30,063 --> 02:45:40,348
And, you know, if there are surplus funds that we could take and maybe it's not a million dollars, but maybe it's a start, maybe we can find some funding, then maybe we should do that.

1688
02:45:40,768 --> 02:45:43,909
But I think it is, you know, something that we should take a look at.

1689
02:45:44,049 --> 02:45:46,190
You know, we should be willing to reinvest in our city.

1690
02:45:46,550 --> 02:45:48,771
I mean, you know, we get state funding, we get federal funding.

1691
02:45:49,391 --> 02:45:51,132
Let's take a look at, you know, what we have here.

1692
02:45:51,643 --> 02:46:01,228
to see what we can actually put into reinvesting in ourselves, reinvesting in our city and making it a better place and making better neighborhoods with smoother roads and improving the quality of life.

1693
02:46:01,748 --> 02:46:03,389
So, I just want to say thank you.

1694
02:46:04,549 --> 02:46:08,931
And recently went to a meeting somewhere and the mayor of another city that was exactly what they said.

1695
02:46:08,991 --> 02:46:11,933
It's time that we start reinvesting in our own community.

1696
02:46:11,953 --> 02:46:18,436
All right, on the motion by Councilor Knight that we investigate

1697
02:46:18,990 --> 02:46:21,711
using infrared technology for our roads.

1698
02:46:23,371 --> 02:46:28,872
A motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by... We're severing all the motions.

1699
02:46:32,673 --> 02:46:35,633
We're severing that from the... I'll make it a BPAPE.

1700
02:46:35,653 --> 02:46:36,434
Those are amendments.

1701
02:46:36,454 --> 02:46:37,514
They're amendments.

1702
02:46:44,833 --> 02:46:48,814
We're going to look at it, and then we're going to bring up your $1 million, and then we'll take up the original paper.

1703
02:46:49,254 --> 02:46:51,655
Councilor Knight.

1704
02:46:52,275 --> 02:46:55,596
I'll be happy to withdraw my amendment and put it in as a B paper.

1705
02:46:56,116 --> 02:46:56,517
Okay.

1706
02:46:58,437 --> 02:46:58,757
All right.

1707
02:46:59,377 --> 02:47:02,938
On motion by Councilor Maxwell.

1708
02:47:03,179 --> 02:47:03,439
Okay.

1709
02:47:03,679 --> 02:47:06,119
You want to sever that as a B paper?

1710
02:47:11,662 --> 02:47:13,583
As amended by Councilor Marks to add

1711
02:47:38,611 --> 02:47:50,718
that we look into adding $1 million to the budget for the roads and as amended by Councilor Knight, that we use infrared technology on the roads.

1712
02:47:57,281 --> 02:47:59,903
On the original motion by Councilor Mox.

1713
02:48:03,045 --> 02:48:04,685
Seconded by Councilor Lueb and Friend.

1714
02:48:04,886 --> 02:48:05,666
All those in favor.

1715
02:48:07,142 --> 02:48:09,023
Roll call vote has been requested.

1716
02:48:12,244 --> 02:48:13,704
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1717
02:48:14,805 --> 02:48:15,265
That's correct.

1718
02:48:15,285 --> 02:48:15,825
As amended.

1719
02:48:16,005 --> 02:48:23,207
It's actually supposed to take up the amendment first.

1720
02:48:32,238 --> 02:48:34,239
Okay, we'll take up the amendment first, which is?

1721
02:48:34,259 --> 02:48:38,000
That's correct.

1722
02:48:38,040 --> 02:48:43,782
So on the motion, Councilor Moxon's request for $1 million, a roll call vote has been requested.

1723
02:48:45,582 --> 02:48:46,502
Councilor Dela Ruzzo?

1724
02:48:46,663 --> 02:48:46,943
Yes.

1725
02:48:47,883 --> 02:48:48,623
Councilor Falco?

1726
02:48:48,763 --> 02:48:49,023
Yes.

1727
02:48:49,503 --> 02:48:50,044
Councilor Knight?

1728
02:48:50,244 --> 02:48:50,524
No.

1729
02:48:51,104 --> 02:48:52,084
Councilor Longo Kern?

1730
02:48:52,544 --> 02:48:52,784
Yes.

1731
02:48:53,645 --> 02:48:54,725
Vice President Moxon?

1732
02:48:54,745 --> 02:48:54,985
Yes.

1733
02:48:55,325 --> 02:48:56,466
Scott Pelli?

1734
02:49:06,921 --> 02:49:14,046
This is for asking, it's the amendment to, that we investigate where to get a million dollars.

1735
02:49:15,027 --> 02:49:22,012
Discussion for a million dollars.

1736
02:49:22,052 --> 02:49:22,513
Yeah.

1737
02:49:22,733 --> 02:49:23,293
Request.

1738
02:49:24,354 --> 02:49:28,718
Request that we add a million dollars to the budget.

1739
02:49:30,359 --> 02:49:30,519
Yeah.

1740
02:49:30,539 --> 02:49:30,599
Yes.

1741
02:49:32,864 --> 02:49:36,607
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, motion passes.

1742
02:49:38,068 --> 02:49:49,237
On the original motion, on the main motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by?

1743
02:49:49,257 --> 02:49:50,017
By Councilor Knight.

1744
02:49:50,678 --> 02:49:51,458
All those in favor?

1745
02:49:53,660 --> 02:49:53,760
Aye.

1746
02:49:55,842 --> 02:49:57,043
Motion passes.

1747
02:49:58,602 --> 02:50:04,683
And on the motion by Councillor Knight to use infrared technology.

1748
02:50:06,604 --> 02:50:10,804
Motion by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor DelaRusso.

1749
02:50:10,864 --> 02:50:11,524
All those in favour?

1750
02:50:14,285 --> 02:50:15,725
Councillor, Vice-President Miles.

1751
02:50:16,345 --> 02:50:19,606
So do we know what this is going to cost, the infrared technology?

1752
02:50:19,746 --> 02:50:20,846
We do know, we're investigating.

1753
02:50:21,726 --> 02:50:22,406
We're investigating.

1754
02:50:22,466 --> 02:50:24,027
So what is the resolution?

1755
02:50:26,284 --> 02:50:33,088
that we investigate using technology.

1756
02:50:33,108 --> 02:50:33,208
Right.

1757
02:50:34,749 --> 02:50:39,012
If he could clarify, because we voted on that thing not too long ago.

1758
02:50:39,052 --> 02:50:40,192
Councillor Layton.

1759
02:50:40,433 --> 02:50:51,599
The amendment would be that the city utilize the newest technology that's out there, which is the infrared technology, just similar to the same way we requested.

1760
02:50:52,620 --> 02:50:54,041
So it is a request of expenditure.

1761
02:50:54,321 --> 02:50:56,022
He's asking for the city to use this infrared

1762
02:50:56,355 --> 02:51:07,958
technology to evaluate the care to evaluate To do the infrared technology and the response back would be it'll cost three million dollars a year to do it No, you asked them to use that during the assessment Right.

1763
02:51:07,978 --> 02:51:20,041
You did you just say I asked them to evaluate the utilization and use infrared you said To evaluate the utilization Just kind of like your resolution now you're changing it now, okay

1764
02:51:23,655 --> 02:51:24,955
Ultimately, it was to evaluate the use.

1765
02:51:24,975 --> 02:51:26,816
The same resolution we put forward before.

1766
02:51:26,836 --> 02:51:30,276
Same resolution we all voted for before.

1767
02:51:30,977 --> 02:51:33,697
Motion by Councillor Knight, seconded by Councillor DelaRusso.

1768
02:51:34,457 --> 02:51:35,117
All those in favour?

1769
02:51:35,137 --> 02:51:35,217
Aye.

1770
02:51:37,218 --> 02:51:38,498
The Chair seems to be in doubt.

1771
02:51:41,419 --> 02:51:42,339
I only heard two ayes.

1772
02:51:46,720 --> 02:51:50,121
Councillor Knight has asked that we withdraw the B paper.

1773
02:51:50,341 --> 02:51:51,361
Thank you, Councillor Knight.

1774
02:51:54,978 --> 02:51:57,600
17 5 0 6 offered by this point in time.

1775
02:51:57,640 --> 02:51:59,261
I'd also like to move to withdraw this paper.

1776
02:51:59,281 --> 02:52:02,423
I've had a correspondence with our city council liaison, Ms.

1777
02:52:02,483 --> 02:52:11,169
Felch, and she and I have scheduled a meeting to sit down and further discuss the C click fixed documents upon receiving 17 5 0 6 upon receipt.

1778
02:52:11,189 --> 02:52:13,491
I'll be happy to share the information with my council colleagues.

1779
02:52:13,591 --> 02:52:14,511
I'd like to thank you, Ms.

1780
02:52:14,572 --> 02:52:21,176
Felch for her proactive response to my resolution and also her assistance in resolving a couple of issues.

1781
02:52:22,057 --> 02:52:22,377
Thank you.

1782
02:52:23,257 --> 02:52:23,657
Okay.

1783
02:52:29,421 --> 02:52:31,502
I am just about ready to get on to that.

1784
02:52:31,522 --> 02:52:39,987
But before we do that, I want to let everyone know that there's been a slight change to our summer schedule for the meeting.

1785
02:52:41,768 --> 02:52:50,033
We will be meeting on July 18th and August 15th in the new media center at the high school.

1786
02:52:51,303 --> 02:53:02,507
where we'll have the ability to take the meeting and show it at a later date and maybe she's ready by then we may be able to be live but I wouldn't count on that at this moment.

1787
02:53:03,147 --> 02:53:05,568
I had the opportunity to go up there yesterday for a press conference.

1788
02:53:05,608 --> 02:53:12,750
It's a very nice room and I think it'll serve our council well that we do those two meetings there and I think everybody will be happy.

1789
02:53:13,550 --> 02:53:18,212
So please take note of the changes, the change of location and the date.

1790
02:53:27,806 --> 02:53:32,507
We'll speak to the mayor about having Mr. Clemente do a reverse 9-1-1 to that.

1791
02:53:32,867 --> 02:53:35,108
Mr. Clerk, if you could make that notation there.

1792
02:53:37,608 --> 02:53:38,648
All right, petitions.

1793
02:53:40,749 --> 02:53:47,791
Communications are from the mayor.

1794
02:53:47,811 --> 02:53:48,171
17-5-1-2.

1795
02:53:48,271 --> 02:53:53,813
Dear Mr. President and Councillors, I submit herewith for your approval the fiscal 2018

1796
02:53:55,652 --> 02:54:01,255
budget for the City of Memphis for the period of July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.

1797
02:54:10,960 --> 02:54:13,421
I will give a brief synopsis and we will waive the reading.

1798
02:54:14,522 --> 02:54:23,366
The total submitted appropriations to cover municipal salaries and expenses, including those of the Memphis School Department are municipal departments.

1799
02:54:25,335 --> 02:54:25,635
for a total of $161,117,437.

1800
02:54:26,315 --> 02:54:26,916
For a total of $161,117,437.

02:54:54,706 --> 02:54:59,268
On the motion by Councillor Knight, the table to the conclusion of the bylaws.

1802
02:55:00,569 --> 02:55:02,470
Seconded by Councillor Smith.

1803
02:55:03,390 --> 02:55:04,091
All those in favour?

1804
02:55:05,271 --> 02:55:06,352
Motion passes.

1805
02:55:08,733 --> 02:55:13,635
Let's see.

1806
02:55:13,675 --> 02:55:24,220
17, by the President and City Councillors, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honourable Body appropriate

1807
02:55:25,351 --> 02:55:34,435
$188,400 from the sale of lost and graves accounts to the Cemetery Department's salary account.

1808
02:55:35,736 --> 02:55:40,858
This recommended appropriation is requested in accordance with the fiscal 18 budget.

1809
02:55:41,158 --> 02:55:48,641
The Cemetery Department's salary account is reduced each year in anticipation of an appropriation from sales of lost and graves.

1810
02:55:49,181 --> 02:55:53,563
In addition, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honorable Body appropriate

1811
02:55:56,581 --> 02:56:01,663
$1,861 for care to the Cemetery Department Expense Budget.

1812
02:56:02,163 --> 02:56:08,104
This is recommended in accordance with the fiscal 2018 budget.

1813
02:56:08,964 --> 02:56:18,247
The Cemetery Expense Budget is reduced each year in anticipation of appropriation from in addition to the upcoming budget hearings.

1814
02:56:19,307 --> 02:56:23,128
I respectfully request that this be forwarded to the committee of the whole hearing.

1815
02:56:23,608 --> 02:56:24,228
Yours truly,

1816
02:56:25,191 --> 02:56:33,835
Stephanie and Burke mayor on the motion by council night to refer this to the committee of the host.

1817
02:56:34,375 --> 02:56:36,556
Seconded by council spot Scott Pelly.

1818
02:56:37,016 --> 02:56:37,777
All those in favor.

1819
02:56:38,677 --> 02:56:39,778
Motion passes.

1820
02:56:42,699 --> 02:56:43,799
Please mark president.

1821
02:56:44,040 --> 02:56:44,460
Uh, sorry.

1822
02:56:44,480 --> 02:56:51,683
God councilor Russo as opposed 17 five one four.

1823
02:56:52,763 --> 02:56:53,764
Dear Mr. President,

1824
02:56:54,911 --> 02:56:55,872
and city councilors.

1825
02:56:55,952 --> 02:57:01,915
I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following transfer.

1826
02:57:02,175 --> 02:57:08,599
$900,000 to be transferred from Water Retained Earnings to account 340450578000008672017 Water Capital Project.

1827
02:57:08,659 --> 02:57:09,079
The amount of $900,000

1828
02:57:23,440 --> 02:57:32,149
is requested to purchase a water main leak detection system as was displayed in the meeting earlier this year with the Water and Soil Commissioners.

1829
02:57:32,729 --> 02:57:39,416
We strongly believe that this purchase will not only save dollars, but this commodity.

1830
02:57:42,379 --> 02:57:46,583
I respectfully request that the paper be forwarded to the Council of the whole

1831
02:57:47,383 --> 02:57:49,885
for our deliberation during the budget process.

1832
02:57:50,345 --> 02:57:57,610
The remaining balance in the retained water and earnings after this transfer will be $2,769,199.

1833
02:58:02,734 --> 02:58:05,436
Motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by?

1834
02:58:07,237 --> 02:58:11,660
By Councilor Falco to move this to a committee of the whole meeting.

1835
02:58:11,820 --> 02:58:12,581
All those in favor?

1836
02:58:14,822 --> 02:58:15,623
Vice President Mox.

1837
02:58:16,590 --> 02:58:17,891
Thank you, Mr. President.

1838
02:58:19,111 --> 02:58:30,496
This is a very important issue that leak detection, this council has been discussing for a number of years due to the high water and sewer rates in this community.

1839
02:58:31,016 --> 02:58:32,917
Not only leak detection, but INI, inflow.

1840
02:58:32,937 --> 02:58:35,578
My mic's not on, Mr. President.

1841
02:58:35,698 --> 02:58:37,298
Oh, mine is, Mr. President.

1842
02:58:37,318 --> 02:58:37,619
I'm sorry.

1843
02:58:37,639 --> 02:58:39,940
I apologize.

1844
02:58:39,980 --> 02:58:40,840
That's all right, Mr. President.

1845
02:58:41,700 --> 02:58:45,802
So this is an important issue, Mr. President, that this council has been discussing

1846
02:58:46,223 --> 02:58:48,525
for a number of years, leak detection in the community.

1847
02:58:49,265 --> 02:58:52,668
We've also discussed I&I inflow and infiltration.

1848
02:58:53,149 --> 02:59:03,177
It's costing the ratepayers of this community millions of dollars a year based on water that's leaking in our old, outdated water pipes that are underground.

1849
02:59:03,897 --> 02:59:09,941
A little known fact, Mr. President, about 90% of the water leaks never surface.

1850
02:59:10,802 --> 02:59:15,725
So you may think, well, if we have water leaks, we're going to see water leaking down streets and so forth.

1851
02:59:15,985 --> 02:59:17,686
90% of the water never surfaces.

1852
02:59:18,247 --> 02:59:27,573
According to the MWRA, 17% to 20% of the water used in Meffitt each year is unaccounted for water that's lost to leakage.

1853
02:59:28,273 --> 02:59:29,514
So you can imagine that figure.

1854
02:59:32,270 --> 02:59:33,451
as well as unaccountable.

1855
02:59:34,332 --> 02:59:39,776
It's not me or anyone else's responsibility.

1856
02:59:40,236 --> 02:59:59,611
The new system, which I worked on for some six months, at the time, the company claimed in five years, Method could save about $5 million with this leak detection system and save up to 15 million gallons of water annually by installing this system.

1857
03:00:02,005 --> 03:00:04,847
In my opinion, Mr. President, a no-brainer.

1858
03:00:05,647 --> 03:00:07,428
It's long overdue in this community.

1859
03:00:08,149 --> 03:00:25,339
I believe it's money well spent that over the years will find its way to the ratepayer and we can actually start seeing potentially a savings when it comes to our water and sewer bill or at least not see the steady increases that we've grown accustomed to.

1860
03:00:25,359 --> 03:00:28,681
Additionally, Mr. President, that

1861
03:00:29,845 --> 03:00:31,666
with this particular leak detection system.

1862
03:00:32,447 --> 03:00:38,970
What we were told by the president is that you need appropriate staff to monitor this system.

1863
03:00:40,311 --> 03:00:46,455
And right now, as we all know, we don't have the appropriate staff to do so.

1864
03:00:46,995 --> 03:00:55,040
So I'm hoping, which will accompany this paper, also an additional request for staff, Mr. President.

1865
03:00:55,840 --> 03:00:57,421
The way the system works, and I think it's

1866
03:00:57,801 --> 03:01:11,216
appropriate people in this community know is that the company, whoever gets selected, would install an acoustic whistling device on the water mains in the gap valves between streets.

1867
03:01:11,897 --> 03:01:14,259
They would be spaced out in a big grid across the city.

1868
03:01:14,840 --> 03:01:18,824
The company would listen to the device overnight and there's

1869
03:01:19,965 --> 03:01:33,863
and they could tell where the leaks are coming from by taking samples of the acoustic sounds and pinpointing within a couple of feet where we have leaks in the community and then be able to prioritize those leaks and address them.

1870
03:01:34,590 --> 03:01:42,273
And hopefully over time, we'll be addressing and lowering the percentage of unaccounted for water within our community.

1871
03:01:42,733 --> 03:01:45,634
So I've been pushing for leak detection for a number of years.

1872
03:01:46,615 --> 03:01:52,177
INI inflow and infiltration is a whole other thing in the community, which is another issue.

1873
03:01:52,633 --> 03:01:54,514
I've been pushing for, Mr. President.

1874
03:01:54,954 --> 03:02:04,800
That's groundwater that's seeping into our sewer system and being treated as raw sewage, which is costing the ratepayers of this community tens of millions of dollars a year.

1875
03:02:06,101 --> 03:02:17,968
The one thing I would ask, Mr. President, that my colleagues consider is that currently, right now, the school system and the city do not pay for their water.

1876
03:02:19,462 --> 03:02:24,984
It is not included in the operating budget for the schools and for the city.

1877
03:02:25,965 --> 03:02:35,428
One knows any homeowner knows when you have your, you look at your car insurance, you look at your groceries and water and sewer is part of your budget.

1878
03:02:35,969 --> 03:02:39,870
It's part of operating so you can flush your toilet, take showers, water your lawn.

1879
03:02:40,170 --> 03:02:44,732
It's part of the budget and our city for some reason, not part of the budget.

1880
03:02:45,730 --> 03:02:46,250
And guess what?

1881
03:02:46,290 --> 03:02:49,132
When it's not part of the budget, Mr. President, what happens?

1882
03:02:49,812 --> 03:02:51,033
You tend not to conserve.

1883
03:02:51,053 --> 03:02:53,874
It doesn't matter how much water I'm using.

1884
03:02:54,654 --> 03:02:55,935
The ratepayers will pay for that.

1885
03:02:55,955 --> 03:02:57,056
It doesn't matter.

1886
03:02:57,596 --> 03:02:59,817
We'll just add it on to the ratepayers.

1887
03:03:00,877 --> 03:03:03,019
They'll grin and bear it and take it, Mr. President.

1888
03:03:03,759 --> 03:03:08,841
You know, if these buildings are meted, it should be part of the overall working budget.

1889
03:03:10,002 --> 03:03:11,963
It should be part of the budget, Mr. President.

1890
03:03:12,243 --> 03:03:13,704
It shouldn't be outside of a budget.

1891
03:03:14,707 --> 03:03:24,316
And in order to make this system work, we have to account for every entity in this community, and that includes the school system and also the municipal buildings.

1892
03:03:24,796 --> 03:03:31,122
And there's no reason why, Mr. President, where those buildings are needed that we're not accounting for them in the budget.

1893
03:03:31,402 --> 03:03:35,386
When I was on the school committee back some years ago, it was part of the operating budget.

1894
03:03:36,392 --> 03:03:50,758
And then Mayor McGlynn, because he found out a good way of shifting it off of the Prop 2.5 within the budget, and said, I could put that within the ratepayers and also increase my budget on other things that I want to do.

1895
03:03:51,818 --> 03:03:53,639
And, Mr. President, it should work that way.

1896
03:03:53,959 --> 03:03:59,241
Just recently, the administration asked us to combine the water and sewer enterprise account.

1897
03:03:59,862 --> 03:04:00,142
Why?

1898
03:04:00,602 --> 03:04:02,883
Because it was easy for accounting for them.

1899
03:04:03,870 --> 03:04:11,112
So why would they approach us and say, you know what, we also want to make sure that our buildings that are already needed, that we include them in the budget.

1900
03:04:13,412 --> 03:04:22,695
I'm telling you right now, Mr. President, there are several issues that if they're not addressed in this budget, like I did last year, and I know Councilor Lungo, I will not support this budget.

1901
03:04:23,395 --> 03:04:24,955
I will not support it, Mr. President.

1902
03:04:25,695 --> 03:04:28,476
The mayor will have to account on the other members.

1903
03:04:29,916 --> 03:04:32,437
But unless we hold our feet, Mr. President, to the fire,

1904
03:04:33,480 --> 03:04:39,002
and make sure we address these issues and not just give lip service, that's the time to do it.

1905
03:04:40,543 --> 03:04:42,644
So, Mr. President, I support this wholeheartedly.

1906
03:04:43,164 --> 03:04:55,250
I would hope that we also have a discussion on staffing to be able to look at these leaks and instantaneously get a report to show where these leaks are.

1907
03:04:55,690 --> 03:05:02,533
And also, Mr. President, that once again, the school side and the municipal side include the water

1908
03:05:03,051 --> 03:05:05,213
and sewer within their budgeting process.

1909
03:05:06,674 --> 03:05:07,054
Thank you.

1910
03:05:07,074 --> 03:05:09,215
Mr. Vice president's counselor.

1911
03:05:09,255 --> 03:05:12,177
Nice.

1912
03:05:12,297 --> 03:05:15,039
Name and address for the record, please.

1913
03:05:16,500 --> 03:05:20,983
Andrew Castaneda, Cushman street method mass on a positive note.

1914
03:05:21,023 --> 03:05:26,307
I'd like to thank all your counselors, the mayor, all the salary employees,

1915
03:05:27,630 --> 03:05:31,952
and especially the volunteers for doing all the hard work and trying to improve our city.

1916
03:05:32,212 --> 03:05:33,073
Thank you very much.

1917
03:05:35,334 --> 03:05:41,197
And as far as saving taxpayers money on the water, it sounds really good to me.

1918
03:05:43,278 --> 03:05:45,899
Trust is good, but verify would be better.

1919
03:05:47,100 --> 03:05:56,585
The city is strongly believing this device or system will not only save taxpayers money, and it may be a good idea,

1920
03:05:57,143 --> 03:06:09,092
But verifying if it's historically a fact and true is a better, I believe, and a must idea before spending almost a million dollars of the people's money.

1921
03:06:10,693 --> 03:06:11,934
Is it a wise purchase?

1922
03:06:12,254 --> 03:06:13,015
Does it work?

1923
03:06:13,936 --> 03:06:20,100
So like, who, what cities have bought this system in the last three years?

1924
03:06:20,521 --> 03:06:24,263
And can we call them and ask if they saved any money?

1925
03:06:25,264 --> 03:06:26,405
And how much per year?

1926
03:06:26,840 --> 03:06:27,180
Please.

1927
03:06:27,621 --> 03:06:31,584
I also recollect the new water meters, they're probably 10 to 15 years old.

1928
03:06:32,905 --> 03:06:41,612
And those are supposed to be all kinds of bells and whistles, and I believe in those meters, I believe one of the counselors had brought up, and I'm not sure if that saved us any money.

1929
03:06:42,433 --> 03:06:54,663
But I'd like to see from past experiences who has bought this around our locale under the MWRA system, if they in fact really did save or did it

1930
03:06:55,550 --> 03:07:01,835
did they not save and they spent a million dollars or whatever and was a cost effective period.

1931
03:07:01,935 --> 03:07:02,335
Thank you.

1932
03:07:02,655 --> 03:07:02,956
Thank you.

1933
03:07:04,957 --> 03:07:06,158
Name and address of the record, please.

1934
03:07:06,558 --> 03:07:07,519
Thank you, Mr. President.

1935
03:07:07,559 --> 03:07:09,400
Rob Caputi, 71 Evans street.

1936
03:07:09,981 --> 03:07:12,082
I want to thank you all for this discussion.

1937
03:07:12,583 --> 03:07:14,804
I think this is one of the biggest pebbles in the pond.

1938
03:07:15,425 --> 03:07:22,030
Uh, when, when we're paying for water that that falls out of the sky, I mean, look at it from the perspective of the businesses.

1939
03:07:22,463 --> 03:07:27,428
who might have to raise their prices a little bit for goods and services.

1940
03:07:28,289 --> 03:07:41,263
Other residents who, like the city treasurer said before this council a couple months ago in talking about going after delinquent taxpayers, she said it's not fair to the residents who are, quote, sacrificing

1941
03:07:41,662 --> 03:07:43,523
new cars and vacations.

1942
03:07:44,864 --> 03:07:45,784
Why do you think that is?

1943
03:07:46,164 --> 03:07:49,646
It's because they're paying for water that literally falls out of the sky.

1944
03:07:50,186 --> 03:07:54,389
Is god going to be charged this new connectivity tax?

1945
03:07:54,449 --> 03:07:55,109
I don't think so.

1946
03:07:55,429 --> 03:07:57,930
The Metro residents and businesses are.

1947
03:07:59,451 --> 03:08:04,794
It would help the overall local community to really get a grasp on this before

1948
03:08:05,878 --> 03:08:07,619
and not just keep letting it go.

1949
03:08:07,959 --> 03:08:12,741
I mean, businesses are losing in this square so much money because of that Craddock bridge.

1950
03:08:12,801 --> 03:08:19,384
I know one proprietor, since it's happened, has lost close to a million dollars in business.

1951
03:08:19,745 --> 03:08:30,109
When you add these taxes and fees on it, I mean, it becomes a priority that really shouldn't just slip through your fingers and get away.

Mr. President.

1965
03:09:32,927 --> 03:09:40,088
He was very active in this community, a big advocate for the disabled community, and I would ask that we have a moment of silence.

1966
03:09:40,869 --> 03:09:41,149
I agree.

1967
03:09:41,649 --> 03:09:43,069

Wreckage of the meeting of May 3rd.

03:10:03,366 --> 03:10:04,547
Uh, Castaneda Christian.

1973
03:10:04,887 --> 03:10:07,108
Uh, someone brought up, there's a meeting coming up.

1974
03:10:07,208 --> 03:10:08,289
What was that meeting?

1975
03:10:09,450 --> 03:10:12,171
I think it's 1 p.m.

1976
03:10:12,571 --> 03:10:12,972
1 p.m.

1977
03:10:13,092 --> 03:10:16,474
And that's behind the dogger Andrews, I presume.

1978
03:10:16,774 --> 03:10:19,075
Okay.

1979
03:10:19,295 --> 03:10:19,596
Okay.

1980
03:10:20,076 --> 03:10:22,037
Um, also I think there's two other meetings.

1981
03:10:22,057 --> 03:10:26,420
Riverbend park is at seven o'clock.

1982
03:10:26,640 --> 03:10:27,120
I'm sorry.

1983
03:10:27,440 --> 03:10:29,421
Riverbend park is at seven o'clock.

1984
03:10:29,442 --> 03:10:30,142
The bike path.

1985
03:10:30,595 --> 03:10:34,377
And for the bike path, that's at the most, I think it's at the Andrews.

1986
03:10:35,037 --> 03:10:36,738
It's also, okay, at the Andrews.

1987
03:10:37,638 --> 03:10:44,822
And also, I believe there's some, my friend Captain Barry Clemente called about some, the final traffic meeting, possible citywide traffic.

1988
03:10:44,842 --> 03:10:47,903
There's also a traffic meeting also tomorrow night on Thursday night.

1989
03:10:48,544 --> 03:10:49,984
So Thursday night's a very busy night.

1990
03:10:50,185 --> 03:10:59,049
So Thursday night's meeting is about the last meeting for the proposed possible citywide or part of the citywide

1991
03:11:00,123 --> 03:11:01,263
resident pocket only.

Yes.

1993
03:11:01,864 --> 03:11:02,244
Correct.

1994
03:11:02,404 --> 03:11:02,944
That's correct.

1995
03:11:02,964 --> 03:11:03,204
Okay.

1996
03:11:03,724 --> 03:11:04,785
And what time is that?

1997
03:11:04,825 --> 03:11:06,065
And what location, sir?

1998
03:11:06,545 --> 03:11:06,825
Doubt.

1999
03:11:07,125 --> 03:11:18,889
