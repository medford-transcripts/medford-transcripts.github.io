1
00:00:00,431 --> 00:00:06,678
All right, so I think we might as well jump in if we're all good to go.

2
00:00:06,698 --> 00:00:08,680
I just want to make sure that we're recording.

3
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:11,924
All right.

4
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,648
So I will call us.

5
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:18,111
Thank you.

6
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:20,773
So I will call us to order.

00:01:18,648 --> 00:01:28,351
Our agenda tonight is be it resolved as motioned at the November 4th, 2024 regular school committee meeting, the following resolution was moved for further discussion to this subcommittee.

18
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:46,397
2024-40, offered by Mayor Lungo Kern, consolidation language for diversity, equity, and inclusion, DEI support, whereas the city's DEI director and ADA coordinator is supporting school ADA, DEI, crisis management, HR, and training needs by being a resource to the school administration team.

19
00:01:48,297 --> 00:01:53,740
I'm going to go ahead and call the roll to make sure we are all here and we'll get started.

20
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,561
So, Member Reinfeldt.

21
00:01:58,522 --> 00:01:58,822
Present.

22
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:00,503
Member Russo.

23
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:03,959
And member will pot it present.

24
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,840
That's 3 present 0 absent.

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,080
We're good to go.

26
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,121
So, thank you for that.

27
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:27,765
So, I think to start, I'll add some immediate thoughts from the meeting that had his call to this subcommittee meeting, which was some questions and some, I think, clarification about the current practices of leaning on the city's director and how she's been offering her support and expertise on questions about these.

28
00:02:28,505 --> 00:02:31,868
different circumstances and how best we can continue to support the school district.

29
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:53,164
I think the most immediate question for at least myself was are we preparing other staff for example with these you know these practices and trainings so they can then go into the community and go into the school district community and support when our DEI director from the city side is not available per se as well as are we

30
00:02:54,426 --> 00:02:58,871
Is there a potential to have another staff or a date in that process?

31
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:01,214
Some of the things that also came up was.

32
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:15,814
The pros in my mind were that there might be broader expertise, having someone on the city side who understands the state's suggestions and mandates and policies and procedures of these practices, who can help implement them in the school system.

33
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:23,237
Are we aligning the school districts, DEI, ADA, crisis management, HR, in trainings?

34
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:25,558
Are they aligned with the city's mission as well?

35
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:32,541
We're resource sharing as well, which I think is incredibly important when we understand how are we implementing them properly?

36
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:40,325
The question I think most immediate for me is that, is there a prioritizing of time?

37
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:44,207
I think that these issues are incredibly diverse and they are ever changing.

38
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:53,692
And so I don't want the city's DEI director to be taken away from her responsibilities day to day if there's opportunity for her to work in tandem with potentially another

39
00:03:54,673 --> 00:04:08,783
Employee from on the city side, or on the school side who can prioritize that day to day, and they can work together to make sure things are aligned, whether it's a full time staffer, or maybe a contractor that's meeting on a, let's say, quarterly basis or by quarterly basis.

40
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:17,770
For example, those are most immediate questions that I have and I would ask my colleagues if they have any other considerations they'd like to add before we kind of open it up for further discussion.

41
00:04:22,825 --> 00:04:32,464
I think Member Olopade summarized it well, I think it would be good for this committee to understand what has been happening, what the need is, and what that intersection looks like in terms of

42
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:56,260
building capacity within the district, understanding that there is very particular training that Director Nwaje has that people in the school district don't have, and just really making the best use of people's time and expertise in a really collaborative way that makes sure that everyone who needs to be supported is supported on both sides of things.

43
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,340
Thank you.

44
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,240
And I did voice this during the school committee meeting.

45
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:19,363
And I do have, you know, when school committee members are on boarded, we go through a training and there's a lot of focus on what we do not have access to.

46
00:05:20,603 --> 00:05:25,924
And so, you know, the employees of Medford public schools are not employees of the city of Medford.

47
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:53,514
And so I'm concerned about setting a precedent where somebody who is not an employee of Medford Public Schools is, and this is not a, say something about Francis, who I think I have a great relationship with, but I am concerned that we, do we even have any kind of, any document in place that authorizes

48
00:05:54,334 --> 00:06:15,885
somebody who is not part of the school system and also I have no idea since we don't get a report which makes sense because we this doesn't seem like the kind of stuff that stuff that that Frances has been involved in doesn't seem like the stuff we would get a report on but I am curious if there has been any involvement with student related

49
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:29,315
issues and not students like the global, the generalized students, but individual students.

50
00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:35,440
Because again, when we go for our training, we are kind of beaten into us a bit.

51
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:39,983
that we can never ask for anything about any individual students.

52
00:06:40,043 --> 00:06:45,566
We have no rights to know anything about individual students in our district.

53
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:59,974
And so those are some of my concerns that I'm not saying those things have not been worked out, but they're not worked out in a way where I have any insight or knowledge of.

54
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:02,395
So those are some of my thoughts.

55
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:08,543
Right.

56
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:15,947
I think another moment, I think also the question about availability, I think is a big part of it.

57
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:25,332
Something that I think we've run into is making sure that we are as available to the student population and their immediate families and related relations outside of that.

58
00:07:25,832 --> 00:07:33,776
Are we supporting them not just in the most emergent situations, but I think outside of the most emergent situations and making sure that we're maintaining that relationship after

59
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:51,527
And again, I think, because these issues are ever changing, it feels as though having a better understanding about how we are diverting time away from the city side of these initiatives and these trainings that the D. I. office is pursuing.

60
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:55,509
Are we taking time away from them to pursue those from the city side to this district?

61
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:57,290
And then are we taking time away from them to make sure that we're doing the right thing?

62
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,271
Is that happening on the other side, the other way around?

63
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:12,577
And I think that just having a better understanding about how much that's been happening thus far, and is that compliant or consistent with our values as a district is also something that I'd like to hear about, too, about the time management questions I think we're all having as well.

64
00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:22,341
So if our director would like to chime in or anyone on the school side that feels like they have some insight would be really appreciated, I think.

65
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:29,948
I would love to let Ms.

66
00:08:29,988 --> 00:08:35,409
Nwaje Francis weigh in on how she has been supporting the schools.

67
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:49,172
And, you know, I did make comments on November 4th, but I think the fact that she's here, she should be able to speak to the work that she has done and answer any of your questions directly.

68
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:50,672
I think that's fantastic.

69
00:08:50,712 --> 00:08:57,373
The language in this resolution is very vague, and so I am very eager to know how we are

70
00:08:59,103 --> 00:09:00,005
to know the details.

71
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,551
So thank you for being here, Francis.

72
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,542
Well, thank you all for inviting me.

73
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:30,815
I welcome the opportunity to talk about my role as what is, you know, currently known as the DEI Director, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, is the terminology that has been used over the past five to seven years, evolving from the real name, which is the Office of Affirmative Action, Equal Opportunity, and Civil Rights.

74
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:35,718
And I raised that because that's how I was trained.

75
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:38,320
I was trained as a civil rights representative.

76
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,721
What does that mean in a nutshell?

77
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:50,128
It means that whatever space I am in, I am required to know which of the titles I need to apply and apply them to ensure the compliance for that space.

78
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:56,412
So whether it's the schools, the municipal, a private entity, or even a family owned business of more than 50 people.

79
00:09:58,905 --> 00:10:02,908
One of the things that I do want to do is make sure that you can rest assured.

80
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:11,736
I did not have access to student information, nor would I ever, nor would anybody in this role ever require access to student information.

81
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:16,120
You know, that, like you said, it's very vague, right?

82
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,003
But it's not, it's the details aren't there.

83
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:30,155
But let's just say a call comes in and I'm told that some, you know, hateful imaging or, you know, unchoice words have been discovered.

84
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:41,127
It is important to know more of the ethnic identity of the person that did the discovery as a way of, you know, collaborating and planning support.

85
00:10:42,107 --> 00:10:48,412
versus knowing the name and who they are and, you know, none of that comes into play.

86
00:10:48,892 --> 00:10:56,598
And that goes along to say with student files, that information does not come to play.

87
00:10:57,098 --> 00:11:02,262
I only know about students when they meet me and they introduce themselves to me or they invite me.

88
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:10,126
And case in point, the GSA group at the high school, I don't encroach on their time.

89
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:22,712
I wait for their invitation for me to join their groups and I show up and provide them with the support that they need or just be a listening ear if that is their choice.

90
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:34,215
The only time that it would be necessary for me to know the identity of a student was in the very extreme case.

91
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:37,377
Now I'm speaking under the ADA role.

92
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:47,720
The school had, let us say, a deaf, not hard of hearing, but a deaf blind student who required ASL interpretation.

93
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:53,162
That requires a different form of signing that is in hand signing.

94
00:11:53,942 --> 00:12:01,968
And as you know, ASL interpreters are hard to come by, let alone interpreters that have the ability to sign in hand.

95
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:02,789
Right?

96
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:13,918
I need that information, not for myself, but I need to list that individual just as I list community members' names on the request that I send out to MCDHH.

97
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,874
So, you know, those are the extreme parameters.

98
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:32,885
So, for, you know, those of us that are hearing those of us that could be tuned in, I want to make sure that, you know, that the director does not have, nor would the director have unnecessary access to student information.

99
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:41,248
And additionally, understand that I'm bound by the strictest laws of confidentiality, which in turn pose their own issues, right?

100
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:55,713
I need to make certain decisions and I'm required to make those decisions by sharing the least amount of information possible, regardless of who I am making those decisions about and who I am informing.

101
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:00,755
So I always have to keep that in the back of my mind because I deal with

102
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:13,208
highly sensitive information to the point where the facts actually comes directly to me and doesn't go to a general delivery because I deal with people's medical providers.

103
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:18,471
I'm sorry, Member Reinfeldt, I just saw you raise your hand.

104
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,894
No, I'm just curious, are you a mandated reporter?

105
00:13:22,374 --> 00:13:23,976
Yes, all those things.

106
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:24,978
Great.

107
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:29,322
I just I am a mandated reporter as well.

108
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:35,688
So I don't you know civil rights that doesn't it doesn't you don't get to take it off.

109
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:42,414
You know unfortunately you wear it you straighten it up in the morning before you leave the house that it looks good and proper.

110
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:48,597
So, and really the role is to be that mediator, right?

111
00:13:48,678 --> 00:13:51,339
If we're not at compliance, why aren't we at compliance?

112
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,439
And how can we get there?

113
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,220
And what can we do?

114
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,401
It's truly a partnership.

115
00:13:56,461 --> 00:14:00,503
It's truly a collaborative effort because I do have to work.

116
00:14:01,183 --> 00:14:14,738
In partnership with the administrators at the school, I learned from them and I learned from the teachers and as a result, I then better understand what the need is and how I can be a support to them.

117
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,511
My trainings are ongoing.

118
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:30,659
It looks like the EOC and the DOL and the ADA are all colliding as far as the awards go, right?

119
00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:34,662
There's a lot of intersectionality that is happening at this current time.

120
00:14:35,703 --> 00:14:38,264
I was in a training session for the EOC.

121
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:45,668
Last month, the exact same training that I took in July, and lo and behold, something miraculously has now changed.

122
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,750
You know, you don't stop the learning.

123
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,210
It is ongoing.

124
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:55,432
There is no one place to go and get the information.

125
00:14:55,452 --> 00:14:57,913
I am fortunate that I have

126
00:14:58,613 --> 00:15:03,120
I had great trainers for when I first started my role.

127
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,487
So I have a network and if I am stuck, I can quickly access my network.

128
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:13,194
But there is no such thing as knowing it all.

129
00:15:14,035 --> 00:15:22,721
And in many situations, what might apply for Membo Olaparde might apply very differently for Membo Reinfeldt.

130
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:28,585
And then by the time I get to you, Membo Russo, it's completely off the books because it no longer exists.

131
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:32,748
A law changed somewhere and you didn't get the memo.

132
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,203
You know, it is I'm dealing I'm dealing with life, right?

133
00:15:39,343 --> 00:15:42,265
And when you're dealing with life, it is extremely fluid.

134
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:50,713
And 1 of the greatest things that you can bring to the role is your willingness to be flexible a practitioner and the civil rights expert.

135
00:15:50,753 --> 00:15:51,934
There is no insight.

136
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:56,939
We don't do our work because we're going to see the results of our work.

137
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:01,464
No, we do our work because we're determined to continue to push for change.

138
00:16:02,005 --> 00:16:07,310
Change that is needed on many different levels and change and support for all people.

139
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:10,834
There is no equity if you don't have equality.

140
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:12,796
And I feel like that is

141
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:29,758
Often misunderstood and my role is unique enough that it does allow me to have conversations with entities that would typically not be willing to hear what needs to be said, such as.

142
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:39,347
There is a need for this training, and I need you and your members to engage in this rate if admin or management attempts to have that support.

143
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:40,548
Oh, it's a directive.

144
00:16:40,568 --> 00:16:48,055
It's this, you know, so this role is unique enough to allow for those types of relationship management.

145
00:16:50,358 --> 00:16:51,038
I can't remember.

146
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:53,601
I don't know if there are any more direct questions that.

147
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:57,327
You would like to ask you were worried about time.

148
00:16:57,347 --> 00:16:59,371
I was well groomed for this.

149
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,978
I came from supporting 6000 plus full time employees on my own.

150
00:17:03,998 --> 00:17:04,039
So.

151
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:19,665
You know, differences, different entities were in place all around, but it is, again, you don't look at what you can't do, you look at what do you have and what you have the ability, what can you make of it at this point in time?

152
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:23,808
And, you know, the ability to prioritize is key.

153
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:27,371
You have to know what is your hot button and what you must deal with.

154
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:32,736
You know, when to use an email to say, hey, I got your voicemail, we'll get back to you in such and such time.

155
00:17:34,515 --> 00:17:39,139
where to go to find the resources, who to call if you're in a jam.

156
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,941
Those things aren't necessarily written in a book.

157
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:46,724
They come as part of doing this work on an ongoing basis.

158
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:53,149
And as a civil rights person, you never say no, even if you might wonder, why on earth did this call come to me?

159
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,252
Well, the call came to you because somebody needed somebody to talk to.

160
00:17:57,652 --> 00:18:01,035
And even if it's a gentle handoff that you do, that's what you do.

161
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:06,248
So remember recent.

162
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:07,749
Thank you.

163
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:11,691
No, I really appreciate that information about students.

164
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:19,596
And, you know, I wasn't assuming you did, but I also felt it was our responsibility to know that.

165
00:18:20,236 --> 00:18:24,739
So I feel really much better knowing that I greatly appreciate the clarity.

166
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:36,650
Would you be able to estimate, which after everything you just said, the answer is, it depends on the day, I'm sure, is the answer.

167
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:48,034
But how much time are you spending on school-related, if you can come up with an average, which sounds like an impossible request.

168
00:18:50,513 --> 00:19:07,264
I'm not so sure that I could say that it's an average, but what I can tell you is that I chatted with my colleague over at the school yesterday, and today, I chatted with my same colleague over at the school, and we're only on Tuesday, and it's two different things.

169
00:19:07,504 --> 00:19:11,267
And it's, yeah, it's two completely different things.

170
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:19,553
The thing that we were supposed to chat about yesterday, we chatted about, but something else was involved, too, that just came up.

171
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:41,740
it would be really, really difficult for me to give an estimate because, you know, chatting with my, you know, collaborative partner over there is very different from when I'm doing my research for what is needed based on documentation that somebody's medical provider has submitted, right?

172
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,822
Or conversations about like planning, you know, for an event that is about to happen.

173
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:58,609
But I can safely say that at least once a week, fortunately or unfortunately, my partners hear from me.

174
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:01,771
And it could be anything.

175
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:04,994
It's also resources for me that I need as well.

176
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:07,936
Like, hey, you know, I've got this grand idea.

177
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:11,818
I want to do this, this and this, you know, is there anybody that can help me with that?

178
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:14,620
So it's really, it's two ways.

179
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:16,802
So it's a give and a take.

180
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:23,243
And who do you have a specific collaborator at in the school system?

181
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:35,228
So usually I usually I would say that I have more day to day conversations with Janine over in HR.

182
00:20:35,248 --> 00:20:35,728
There was my.

183
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:40,191
But there are my go-to people for certain things, right?

184
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:46,236
I could come across something and send it to our director of student services, Joan.

185
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:52,480
And sometimes I could actually need Joan's help in answering a question.

186
00:20:53,341 --> 00:20:59,946
Sometimes, you know, I could be looking for the superintendent and the superintendent is dealing with something else.

187
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:04,369
So I'm reverting to either Dr. Cushing or Dr. Galluzzi.

188
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:13,835
So it depends on the actual nature of, you know, the reason for like my outreach.

189
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,555
Thank you.

190
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:33,125
Yeah, I was going to ask if you can't do hours, is there a way to estimate what percentage of the time or what I'm trying to do, because we're being asked to put this into the school budget, which I think is a very

191
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:36,854
Fair request and so trying to figure out.

192
00:21:38,135 --> 00:21:48,562
I know that we can't put a value on this, but to figure out kind of proportionally and looking across the system at how this how this shakes out in terms of.

193
00:21:49,603 --> 00:21:52,685
What time the staff would be spending.

194
00:21:54,447 --> 00:22:10,533
scrambling around to get answers versus you having answers more at the ready and just kind of the percentage or what this looks like if, you know, I think we are blessed to have a resource in house like this and

195
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:19,689
It's just, I would have to really think about it further because I would not want to provide you with misinformation.

196
00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:22,231
You know, for example, the ADA, right?

197
00:22:23,372 --> 00:22:26,014
A request came through for an accommodation, right?

198
00:22:26,114 --> 00:22:28,136
That took about 10 to 15 minutes.

199
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:31,018
Why exactly what the person needed, the doctor had written.

200
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,019
Guess what?

201
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,281
You think you're all done and your file is closed.

202
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:35,282
Actually, it's not.

203
00:22:35,782 --> 00:22:41,523
You go to your two-week check-in, and all of a sudden, there are different things that have gone on with this person.

204
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:47,845
This person is no longer on site, which means that when they return, you will now have to begin the process again.

205
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:58,307
You know, so it's difficult to say that it's 10% or it's 20%, because I don't really, you know, chart it in that manner.

206
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:02,948
There are standard check-ins that, you know, I will do.

207
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:15,600
Or if I have a group of people, I will just make my 1 phone call and be on, still suck up a couple of hours that you need time getting my.

208
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:27,012
Update on everybody and who needs what and how everything is going, but there are things that require on site every, you know, every employee is entitled.

209
00:23:27,452 --> 00:23:31,635
To the opportunity to request a reasonable accommodation that is the law, right?

210
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:34,618
So guess what people usually ask.

211
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:36,419
Oh, can you send the ADA paperwork?

212
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:37,800
No, it doesn't work that way.

213
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:38,681
I'm sorry.

214
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:39,461
I can't send it.

215
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:44,606
I need to do my due diligence to ensure that I give you the opportunity for an interactive dialogue.

216
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:56,032
Some interactive dialogues just they don't end because people need more hand holding and others are more straightforward, but it doesn't end there.

217
00:23:56,152 --> 00:23:59,815
It's still open until all the information comes in.

218
00:24:00,835 --> 00:24:04,738
And sometimes the information comes in and that's still not clear.

219
00:24:04,758 --> 00:24:06,539
It's like, hey, do me a favor.

220
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:11,443
Can you reach out to your doctor and let them know to expect a call from me or things of that nature?

221
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:16,387
And then there is the actual dialogue that takes place with the employee.

222
00:24:17,027 --> 00:24:21,670
Remember, I have to be cognizant that some of our employees are in collective bargaining units.

223
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:28,834
So when people are offering me their lunch times to meet and their break times to meet, absolutely not.

224
00:24:29,814 --> 00:24:33,916
It won't be said that the DEI director stopped you from having your lunch.

225
00:24:34,757 --> 00:24:39,900
So I usually meet during their periods, or at that time, I revert to what I called school time.

226
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:45,923
I meet during the parameters of the school time, and that's part of my work day.

227
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:52,442
So it is very, very difficult for me to say like, oh, it's 10%, 15%.

228
00:24:52,522 --> 00:24:59,908
I mean, out of the blue, I've received a call from a parent who was having custody issues.

229
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:06,653
But from speaking with the parent, I was able to help her understand that the real issue is not the school.

230
00:25:06,693 --> 00:25:14,119
The real issue is the fact that the address listed is not the address where the child lays their head.

231
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:20,001
despite the very valid reasons, right?

232
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:22,182
I didn't ask, how did you reach out to me?

233
00:25:22,262 --> 00:25:23,682
Why did you reach out to me?

234
00:25:23,702 --> 00:25:25,843
There's somebody on the phone that's in crisis.

235
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:26,843
What do you do?

236
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:31,545
You minimize, you mitigate the crisis, so.

237
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:33,826
Okay, the other, oh.

238
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:37,087
Okay, another question.

239
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:42,029
You mentioned having an idea and coming to discuss that.

240
00:25:43,701 --> 00:26:03,994
Again, in the trying to understand what all of this is a resource for and is supporting what that means, what's the balance around things that you are responding to requests from within the school community versus bringing things to the attention versus just the routine follow-up?

241
00:26:04,654 --> 00:26:08,297
I would say that there is definitely more on the response side.

242
00:26:09,185 --> 00:26:21,141
And that was the sense I got certainly there is definitely more on the response side when you have employee to employee allegations that involve violation, alleged violations of civil rights.

243
00:26:21,762 --> 00:26:22,463
Right?

244
00:26:22,723 --> 00:26:24,826
You who is the civil rights officer?

245
00:26:25,879 --> 00:26:26,940
for the city of Medford.

246
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,925
That is hands down who they're, whose involvement they're going to ask for, right?

247
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:37,309
They don't look at whether you're a school department, how is this?

248
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:39,370
And I know HR wants that.

249
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,952
I ran into Janine when I was on campus.

250
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:42,473
Okay.

251
00:26:42,753 --> 00:26:48,035
OK, so I said, yes, I there are these things that I cannot touch and I should not touch.

252
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:49,276
And we absolutely.

253
00:26:49,836 --> 00:26:50,076
Yeah.

254
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:53,638
So, you know, I'm trying to be, you know, trying to be delicate.

255
00:26:53,718 --> 00:26:54,018
Yeah.

256
00:26:54,098 --> 00:26:57,499
So hands down, I'm supporting 100 percent.

257
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,121
I mean, that is what the role calls for.

258
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:10,325
You sort everything else out afterwards or sometimes in, you know, parents who are

259
00:27:12,143 --> 00:27:18,768
whose interpretation of certain rules, certain decisions are slightly skewed.

260
00:27:19,148 --> 00:27:31,697
Your role is to mitigate the issues so that there is clarity and then people have an understanding to move forward in the work.

261
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:36,141
Sometimes it might be teachers who think that they're being

262
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:53,056
Treated differently, and it just takes having a conversation with a different entity for them to understand that you're not being treated differently, you're not being asked to do anything that is outside the scope of your job.

263
00:27:53,597 --> 00:28:07,873
Well I think that that was kind of what I was getting at or wondering about at in terms of building capacity within the district because there is so much work we can do on so many of these fronts, whether it's a physical constraint a cultural constraint a.

264
00:28:09,394 --> 00:28:29,142
situational something that arises in terms of being responsive to what's happening, but also building awareness of resources, of best practices, and all of that, both in terms of our administration, but also the staff and the employees more generally.

265
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:38,767
So I think we have an opportunity, as we say, we have an opportunity to work with Director Nwaje on what DEI looks like in our district.

266
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:56,837
I'm wondering what that opportunity is and whether it's, you know, it is, no, it's really, this is about compliance or this is about the opportunity to do more and make our district a better, more welcoming, more compliant place, which I think is something we would all

267
00:28:58,692 --> 00:29:07,476
love to do and to have really built into that culture from the moment of onboarding, really from recruitment on.

268
00:29:11,078 --> 00:29:21,584
I smile because you mentioned recruitment and my collaborative partners on this call have entertained me and allowed me to

269
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:25,886
You know, bear apart and help support recruitment.

270
00:29:26,046 --> 00:29:34,870
I recently received an email out of the blue from I don't know if it's a resident, but somebody who identified themselves as being a parent.

271
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:43,554
I think there are met for the resident wanting to know what met for public schools is doing as far as recruiting, you know, more diverse teachers.

272
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:58,037
And thankfully, because of the collaborative partnership that we have had, I feel confident in being able to draft some of the stuff that's already in the works and the stuff that's already being done.

273
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:02,517
It is no single person's job.

274
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:05,218
It is an ongoing job.

275
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,919
And what I can say is that while she might want to build capacity

276
00:30:11,237 --> 00:30:14,000
It is not something that can easily be passed on.

277
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:21,708
You have to have the ability to do this day in, day out, because you need to know what toolbox you are opening to address.

278
00:30:21,748 --> 00:30:25,071
You have to weigh pros and you have to weigh cons.

279
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:31,497
So I don't want it to come off as, oh, this is knowledge that you can just

280
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:36,925
You can send some, you know, somebody can go to something and then they'll be done.

281
00:30:36,945 --> 00:30:42,033
I will be the 1st 1 to tell you the mayor gets to review all the bills.

282
00:30:42,814 --> 00:30:46,399
I mean, I'm in some training at least once a month about something.

283
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:55,048
Sometimes I just sit there because it's over my head, and other times it's like, wait a second, they didn't say that the last time I was in.

284
00:30:55,849 --> 00:31:07,340
But it's important, like, you have to know where to go for your civil rights trainings, where to go for your updated legal trainings, where to go for your ADA trainings, the difference between the title 1 and title 2.

285
00:31:09,061 --> 00:31:11,663
You know, okay, what's the situation again?

286
00:31:11,843 --> 00:31:12,244
All right.

287
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:14,566
So you were at a restaurant, right?

288
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:23,733
So now that, you know, is a different impact than, you know, you were at a place of worship or you were at City Hall.

289
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:29,277
So it takes that you can build that capacity, but it will take time.

290
00:31:29,337 --> 00:31:32,760
It is a partnership in learning and there will be some growing pains.

291
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:39,876
And there will be some that you will lose, but through that loss will come the growth, right?

292
00:31:41,537 --> 00:31:45,098
It's an ongoing journey, no destination.

293
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:46,759
Ongoing.

294
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,141
Yes, Member Russell.

295
00:31:52,302 --> 00:31:54,585
Um, yes, so I, I appreciate it.

296
00:31:54,605 --> 00:31:56,808
I especially like that last thing you said that it's a journey.

297
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,009
There's no destination.

298
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:02,775
I feel like that sort of describes a lot of the entire point of education.

299
00:32:05,078 --> 00:32:12,121
And, you know, I was looking around to try and understand how other districts do this work in their own districts.

300
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:19,185
And, of course, just like everything else in public schools, every district seems to have taken a different path.

301
00:32:20,525 --> 00:32:22,806
Since everybody started a different place, that makes sense.

302
00:32:24,887 --> 00:32:30,471
I did find it was hard to get a lot of information from districts for which I am sure there is stuff.

303
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,052
Like, I find nothing on Malden.

304
00:32:32,232 --> 00:32:34,053
There is no chance that Malden has nothing.

305
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:36,775
Their website has nothing.

306
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:46,301
But what I did find was in Watertown, they have a director of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging in the public schools.

307
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:49,483
In Arlington, they have

308
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:55,017
They have a city director and, well, town.

309
00:32:56,198 --> 00:32:59,941
And they also have a director for the schools.

310
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:03,803
And I forget the title of the other person that works there.

311
00:33:04,423 --> 00:33:07,145
And in Somerville, which, I mean, we're not Somerville.

312
00:33:07,806 --> 00:33:08,926
I would like to have their money.

313
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:16,091
I actually would, if you know what's going on in Somerville, I would love to hear a little more, but if you don't,

314
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:19,118
That's on me to go find out.

315
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:20,465
But they have 11 FTEs.

316
00:33:24,284 --> 00:33:26,304
in their office of equity and excellence.

317
00:33:27,545 --> 00:33:29,625
And at first I was like, that's a lot.

318
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:30,985
And then I was like, that's not a lot.

319
00:33:31,185 --> 00:33:34,866
That's because that means they might be actually getting to do the work.

320
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:41,808
Each school building has a four to eight person committee of staff that's already in the building.

321
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:51,249
Every building has an actual, I don't know the title, but a member of that office's staff assigned to that building.

322
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:51,329
And

323
00:33:55,581 --> 00:34:08,208
You know, I think one of the challenges, surely, is that, you know, when we talk about reading instruction, we can talk about outcomes, we can look at scores, and that is...

324
00:34:09,363 --> 00:34:10,604
relatively quantifiable.

325
00:34:11,785 --> 00:34:20,712
And frankly, I think that a lot of the work you do, and I bet the work that's going on in these other districts, is also not terribly quantifiable.

326
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:31,320
I mean, if you have like a specific problem in the student population you're trying to, or the staff that you're trying to address, you could, you know, if you can name the problem,

327
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,560
you can determine is it getting better.

328
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:38,802
But in general, it's probably a very challenging thing to quantify.

329
00:34:38,822 --> 00:34:40,923
As you said, it's the journey.

330
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:53,806
But when I see, frankly, I mean, I wish I could find information in other districts because I find it hard to believe that most other districts don't have some initiatives.

331
00:34:55,287 --> 00:34:57,648
I just see a lot of staff and

332
00:35:01,681 --> 00:35:05,082
And I don't know.

333
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:12,524
I just wonder, you know, we are at a at a crossroads with our passage of the override.

334
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:18,625
And not that that is not as much money as everybody thinks.

335
00:35:19,886 --> 00:35:20,986
It'll be gone before we can.

336
00:35:22,827 --> 00:35:34,315
But I am just trying to understand if having an additional, having an FTE at school focused only is something that makes sense.

337
00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:44,682
And I really like that in Somerville and in Watertown, they don't mention the city in the school website, which I think is relatively normal.

338
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:57,050
I'm assuming on the city sides, they also have somebody, but I like that in Arlington in their office of diversity, equity, inclusion, belonging and justice, the.

339
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,912
You know, there's 2 people that are.

340
00:36:01,012 --> 00:36:05,754
school employees, and there's the city person, and they're all on the website like they're a team.

341
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:10,396
And I think that's how I like to think of this stuff is, you know, team.

342
00:36:12,097 --> 00:36:16,098
And so I guess I'm asking you.

343
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:34,672
Your thoughts on us having our own FTE to be your colleague and, you know, obviously we're not talking about hiring that I would imagine if we were to allocate resources for an FTE, we would very much.

344
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:40,198
have to have you involved in helping us know, well, what does a job description look like?

345
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:42,241
And how do we hire?

346
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:48,007
And obviously, you, I mean, hopefully you would be involved in the actual hiring process.

347
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:51,732
But you did mention

348
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:59,791
recruitment, and that is something that has been pretty sure it's on the strategic plan.

349
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:16,226
I think it's one of the, if it's not a current goal, it has been a goal, the superintendent, and it's, you know, and I've been to every one of these sessions at school committee conferences now for years, and there are many challenges.

350
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:19,569
However, one of the,

351
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:23,940
None of those challenges can be solved if you don't invest.

352
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,722
It actually costs money to go to places to recruit.

353
00:37:28,882 --> 00:37:40,609
You don't just post it on Indeed or whatever the school-based websites are and think you're going to just... That's not how you actually get recruitment to happen.

354
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:43,451
And I'm not saying that's all we're doing, by the way.

355
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:57,541
Having somebody full-time to work on that initiative as well as other school-based initiatives around culture, I would like to hear your thoughts on that.

356
00:37:58,302 --> 00:38:06,909
And can I just jump in on that, that culture and retention, it's one thing to get people into the district, having them stay, just to be really explicit.

357
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:10,452
If there's no belonging, that doesn't happen.

358
00:38:10,993 --> 00:38:11,173
Right.

359
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,863
So, 1st of all, I would like to say, yes, wish we had some of those money, right?

360
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:24,290
If we had some of those money, much of what is needed would already be in place.

361
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:28,673
Ideally for a community this size, I believe we're about 65.

362
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:36,776
thousand plus we translate automatically into six different ethnic languages.

363
00:38:38,197 --> 00:38:41,318
I want to make it clear that this is really a wish list.

364
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:51,123
Diversity, equity and inclusion, civil rights, equal opportunity, affirmative action, equity, belonging, justice, accessibility, whatever you call it.

365
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:54,825
It is one group, one unit on behalf

366
00:38:55,952 --> 00:39:03,757
Of a community, so whilst we might have a charter for the city side and a charter for the school committee side.

367
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:10,661
The very idea that we're different sort of already starts to go against the real mission.

368
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:15,764
The mission is equity for all and we have to start from a place of equality.

369
00:39:16,404 --> 00:39:21,167
So, remember, so I think it was Arlington, my colleague, Jill Harvey.

370
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:27,590
That is the model that you said that you favor, which is that there is an office, right?

371
00:39:28,691 --> 00:39:31,252
And in that office, there is a director.

372
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:33,373
Then you have a representative for the city.

373
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,835
Then you have a representative for the school.

374
00:39:36,915 --> 00:39:38,776
You probably have a community engagement.

375
00:39:38,816 --> 00:39:39,537
You probably have.

376
00:39:41,158 --> 00:39:42,759
There are many aspects.

377
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:48,301
To the role it's not it's what it's not 1 role.

378
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:53,102
As in accounting, you have account payable accounts receivable.

379
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:55,583
It's, it's, it's broken out a lot more.

380
00:39:56,403 --> 00:40:02,085
So, when you see people that are listed specifically as 88 coordinators, they are well versed.

381
00:40:03,926 --> 00:40:08,347
In that role, they know what ranks they're applying.

382
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,788
They're on top of that.

383
00:40:11,596 --> 00:40:21,521
Right and sometimes communities supplement by bringing in design experts to fulfill that role.

384
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:25,442
If you want to do a building redesign and things of that nature.

385
00:40:28,465 --> 00:40:45,978
There are also the other aspects that we don't really talk about, and that is the, you know, the unfortunate aspects, the investigatory, the compliance aspect, who needs to respond to that, the grievance aspect, the complete and utter neutral zone.

386
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:55,645
When you have DEI sitting in HR, it creates conflicts because HR laws and civil rights laws actually don't go hand in hand.

387
00:40:57,879 --> 00:41:06,903
There is sometimes intersectionality that is smooth and other times it is the law that is actually creating the disadvantage.

388
00:41:07,284 --> 00:41:10,965
So you need to defer to the civil rights laws.

389
00:41:11,146 --> 00:41:13,046
I didn't know this when I first started.

390
00:41:13,206 --> 00:41:26,653
You learn this as you're doing the work because you are exposed and in communication with a broad base of professionals, legal experts in different aspects.

391
00:41:28,836 --> 00:41:41,761
So, I, I, you know, I would say if it was my wish list, I would say for the city of Medford from where I sit from the different communities that have been identified as living in Medford.

392
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:43,642
You need a 1 unit.

393
00:41:43,722 --> 00:41:47,223
You need a 1 unit with someone that represents the school.

394
00:41:47,283 --> 00:41:49,024
Somebody that represents the city.

395
00:41:49,805 --> 00:42:00,718
You know, you need your investigatory unit that is able to go in there and handle the investigations and the complaints because they are the ones that are.

396
00:42:01,879 --> 00:42:03,721
versed in that stuff.

397
00:42:04,261 --> 00:42:08,544
I mean, I think everybody knows that I'm a process police.

398
00:42:08,884 --> 00:42:11,947
ADA decisions aren't just pulled out of a hat by me.

399
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:13,127
What is the process?

400
00:42:13,187 --> 00:42:14,448
What, you have no process?

401
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:15,789
We will create one.

402
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:21,914
And that is the process that we will go with for everybody who applies for one, regardless of who that person is.

403
00:42:22,554 --> 00:42:23,595
These are federal laws.

404
00:42:23,655 --> 00:42:27,218
Federal laws require that you are able to show an established process.

405
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:35,489
Um, so it very much is always, you must always remember that compliance is the key as you move forward.

406
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:42,555
So, yeah, we don't have some of those money, but if we did, I would take some of those money and, you know.

407
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:45,358
Welcome the opportunity.

408
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:55,004
to create a unit where people who live, work, do business and study in Medford could go and feel supported.

409
00:42:55,024 --> 00:43:06,851
I mean, there are times when people need the DEI person, but they feel more supported from the ADA person, so they go there, but it doesn't matter because it's the same unit and the person gets served.

410
00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:09,613
Think about all the community members.

411
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:12,796
who require the extra support.

412
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:17,422
Extra support is not just about translating information.

413
00:43:17,522 --> 00:43:22,408
Much of what is translated is not even understood because it's above the ninth grade.

414
00:43:23,029 --> 00:43:28,977
But just even the extra support of, okay, sit in front of the computer and I will sit next to you.

415
00:43:31,727 --> 00:43:34,808
That could all be done.

416
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:38,270
The support and the, oh yes, I'm going to be at that meeting.

417
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:40,111
Will you come to that meeting?

418
00:43:40,211 --> 00:43:42,212
If I'm there, all right, we'll all go together.

419
00:43:42,332 --> 00:43:45,233
Oh, and you'll get your neighbor to come as well because they're a child.

420
00:43:45,653 --> 00:43:47,194
Think about that expansion.

421
00:43:47,854 --> 00:43:50,296
An office like that would help.

422
00:43:55,693 --> 00:44:00,258
Member Russo, I have something I want to add, but I know Member Russo and Member Reinfeldt both put their hands up, so I'll let them.

423
00:44:00,798 --> 00:44:01,319
My hand's down.

424
00:44:03,421 --> 00:44:05,944
I'm curious what processes exist.

425
00:44:07,607 --> 00:44:13,589
And I don't know whether the end of this sentence is in our community or in our schools.

426
00:44:13,669 --> 00:44:17,370
I'm interested particularly in our schools.

427
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:25,153
Is your support of DEI efforts in the school and ADA efforts in the school, is that to help us develop the systems and processes we need?

428
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:26,953
Do we have those in place?

429
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:29,034
Where are we in this work?

430
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:41,964
So, what I will say is that the process was created to avert what was about to happen because decisions were made prior to arrival.

431
00:44:43,165 --> 00:44:45,788
And there was no process to support those decisions.

432
00:44:45,928 --> 00:44:48,291
So, when an employee reached out to me.

433
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:55,219
I could not move forward process had to be created, whether or not you've been given a hammer.

434
00:44:55,239 --> 00:45:01,445
You have to build that house because you need to be able to show.

435
00:45:02,312 --> 00:45:06,133
that you have a set process that you follow for all individuals.

436
00:45:06,413 --> 00:45:08,793
Without equality, there is no equity.

437
00:45:08,913 --> 00:45:16,195
Equity is a figment of many people's imaginations because we're not even at a foundation of equality yet, right?

438
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:22,036
So that process was created, mimic the process that I had from the state.

439
00:45:22,937 --> 00:45:28,338
And it includes what a lot of times people forget, the appeals process.

440
00:45:29,038 --> 00:45:38,624
Yes, we hope that people accept our decisions, but when people choose not to accept our decisions, we are required to clearly spell out their appeals process.

441
00:45:39,284 --> 00:45:43,347
So things like that updates to policies.

442
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:50,931
Those are shared the school policies will always look different because of the purview, but they should never clash.

443
00:45:50,971 --> 00:45:52,312
They should never oppose.

444
00:45:52,352 --> 00:45:56,555
They should always be in some sort of alignment or parallel.

445
00:45:57,175 --> 00:46:05,377
Right things like the notice of non discrimination that's a public notice that I'm required to post so that just gets posted up in the school.

446
00:46:05,457 --> 00:46:08,038
It doesn't matter whether it's a school department.

447
00:46:08,078 --> 00:46:10,578
We just don't discriminate period.

448
00:46:10,658 --> 00:46:10,918
Right?

449
00:46:10,978 --> 00:46:12,279
And it spells out.

450
00:46:13,219 --> 00:46:20,521
So, things like that updated postings that I get from the, I don't keep that to myself.

451
00:46:20,621 --> 00:46:25,402
I share that with my colleagues, because some of it may actually pertain to them.

452
00:46:27,608 --> 00:46:47,597
Sometimes I have, I think poor Joan, I think you've been hit with my information that I've received from one of my magazines, like whether it's like the federal government looking at something as to why there's a shortage of special education teachers, which I don't understand why they don't look at that 15, 20 years ago, but that's just me.

453
00:46:49,899 --> 00:46:54,103
Hey, did you know that they're looking at IEPs?

454
00:46:54,123 --> 00:46:56,846
There's a case about an IEP and stuff like that.

455
00:46:56,866 --> 00:46:59,329
So sometimes it's just information sharing.

456
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:11,527
Yes, if I can comment on this as well as something that memory so mentioned that I think you've kind of illustrated for us.

457
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:14,409
I think that there's also let's go through my notes here.

458
00:47:14,429 --> 00:47:14,990
So I forget.

459
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:15,290
So.

460
00:47:16,051 --> 00:47:27,199
You know, I think that there is a difficulty in quantifying the actual work that's being done day to day, because these instances of need are coming up, you know, as we know, just situationally, right?

461
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:27,999
A lot of the time, right?

462
00:47:28,019 --> 00:47:28,520
Of course, there's.

463
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:34,122
the citywide want to push these initiatives forward because of the benefit of having them in place.

464
00:47:34,502 --> 00:47:35,642
And the schools are the same.

465
00:47:35,662 --> 00:47:46,345
But when we talk about one-on-one meetings, HR questions, crisis management, ADA compliance and DEI protocol and compliance, those things are very much situational.

466
00:47:46,385 --> 00:47:51,727
And so it's difficult to determine how we are supporting students because they come up as they come up.

467
00:47:52,447 --> 00:47:54,948
But I think ultimately what you're talking about is a culture shift.

468
00:47:55,508 --> 00:47:55,768
right?

469
00:47:55,848 --> 00:48:25,215
It's not only having someone on the city side or the school side or both that's there to support in all these instances and endeavors, but also how are we supporting the staff, the families, everyone involved in the education system here in Medford, and how are we actually making it so that everyone feels more informed about these questions so that we don't automatically need to look to the one person in the department as of, you know, with the city that has a limited amount of money right now, comparatively to Summerville has 11 people in their office, right?

470
00:48:25,615 --> 00:48:31,337
We don't always have to look directly to the head of the department to say, can you please offer your expertise?

471
00:48:31,517 --> 00:48:35,118
It's always wished for and wanted, and we know we're seeing the benefits of having that.

472
00:48:35,158 --> 00:48:52,784
But I think we want to continue to work towards making sure that as many people in the district are informed about these things so that they feel semi-informed, or not experts, of course, but they feel like they're as compliant as they can be with their limited understanding so that we're making sure that the culture around MedFed and the school and the students is consistent.

473
00:48:53,184 --> 00:48:56,449
with the state suggestions and what you know as an expert in this field.

474
00:48:56,489 --> 00:49:04,640
So I really want to acknowledge the impact that's having and I think the intentionality that we want to continue to have for the students.

475
00:49:06,022 --> 00:49:10,127
I think one other question was, and I think that it's been touched on a little bit,

476
00:49:11,171 --> 00:49:24,994
When you're going into conversations, both at the school, regarding any of the hats that you're wearing, do you find that there are some stop gaps with the school component of it?

477
00:49:25,014 --> 00:49:29,535
Because I think that there are some needs of students and families that are a little different than the city side, potentially.

478
00:49:29,555 --> 00:49:38,277
Or you find there are moments where you say, I need a little more time than I may, if it was a city question, because the compliance questions differ with younger people.

479
00:49:38,297 --> 00:49:38,917
Does that make sense?

480
00:49:39,908 --> 00:49:40,709
That makes sense.

481
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:46,712
So just for a point of clarification, I don't meet with students.

482
00:49:48,294 --> 00:49:54,478
I mean more so like meeting with like teachers or other people working with students, I should say.

483
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,038
Yeah.

484
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:55,458
Yeah.

485
00:49:55,538 --> 00:50:02,022
So when I'm asked the question, it really the hat that I wear is actually dependent on the question.

486
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:06,405
I get more direct questions about ADA.

487
00:50:06,485 --> 00:50:08,647
So it's easy to just wear that hat.

488
00:50:09,347 --> 00:50:21,253
I get more requests to come in and explain a little bit more or discuss more about my role so that folks have a better understanding.

489
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:25,215
So I take off the ADA hat and I put the DEI hat on.

490
00:50:25,755 --> 00:50:34,400
But I don't answer any legal issues because the attorney that I work with for the school is different from the attorneys that I would work with on the city side.

491
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,541
I don't discuss discipline.

492
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:44,966
Sometimes in conversation, people will, just out of human nature, segue into a venting session.

493
00:50:45,566 --> 00:50:51,029
I am willing to listen to you vent, but I do not overrule decisions that have already been made.

494
00:50:51,629 --> 00:51:02,595
It's well known that the ADA request for a reasonable accommodation is used by many people, not in the city of Medford, just people in general to overcome barriers to performance.

495
00:51:03,996 --> 00:51:06,163
Two completely different things, right?

496
00:51:06,424 --> 00:51:10,256
I don't get involved in in your discipline.

497
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:18,378
You my my involvement is in your union contracts to make sure that you don't have gender binding terminology.

498
00:51:18,438 --> 00:51:19,939
Please start getting rid of all these.

499
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,100
Men women should say employee.

500
00:51:24,341 --> 00:51:30,523
Keep it as neutral as possible so that folks can feel welcome because you do have folks that are.

501
00:51:31,103 --> 00:51:34,145
Gender nonconforming and are stuck in a union.

502
00:51:34,993 --> 00:51:37,053
that makes them choose, right?

503
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:39,394
So it's really just advisory.

504
00:51:39,474 --> 00:51:44,455
It's housekeeping and it should be taking place before contracts go to negotiations.

505
00:51:47,155 --> 00:51:49,835
It is, what's the other thing?

506
00:51:49,855 --> 00:51:53,456
I was gonna say something else, but it just escaped my mind.

507
00:51:53,876 --> 00:51:54,056
Yeah.

508
00:51:56,997 --> 00:51:59,457
I will give you a moment to think of that.

509
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,898
You said something really important just now that also,

510
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:13,887
Whether we have a DEI director or whatever the title ends up being in the schools, I think this is hardly the first time this has been a conversation.

511
00:52:13,907 --> 00:52:25,076
I realize that my school committee colleagues here are new, but after seven years, I can say that this has been a conversation for seven years.

512
00:52:29,343 --> 00:52:43,110
One of the things that I struggle with is that as a school committee member and who very much cares about the culture, which when I say culture, it's definitely employees and students and families.

513
00:52:44,611 --> 00:52:49,353
You know, there's a culture that doesn't go out from the individual.

514
00:52:50,153 --> 00:52:52,715
And we will

515
00:52:53,455 --> 00:52:58,559
I mean, I'm sure we had passed policies that require significant amounts of work.

516
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:03,863
I mean, like literally when I was arriving, there were major culture challenges and a culture study.

517
00:53:05,384 --> 00:53:06,785
That was seven years ago.

518
00:53:06,805 --> 00:53:16,212
And the recommendations of those kinds of things are usually actionable.

519
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:24,963
But they are also not actionable by just anyone.

520
00:53:25,084 --> 00:53:38,453
Your training that you're going through continuously is the kind of stuff where, as much as I admire all of the administrators on this call, they're not in training all day.

521
00:53:38,473 --> 00:53:41,335
If they were, they wouldn't be able to do any of their other work.

522
00:53:44,617 --> 00:53:51,922
I don't see our ability to execute on big culture changes across the system.

523
00:53:51,942 --> 00:53:59,588
I mean, we will have an individual, a new principal, for instance, who's focused on the culture, for instance, of the high school.

524
00:54:00,389 --> 00:54:05,833
And she makes that a priority, which I know she doesn't work in a silo.

525
00:54:05,853 --> 00:54:08,675
She has it as a boss, and I'm sure they've talked about it.

526
00:54:11,327 --> 00:54:29,164
When the school committee decides we want to pass a new policy or allocate money to accomplish something, which we have done several times, actually, on the last few years, getting it done, in my mind, is not because nobody is interested in getting it done.

527
00:54:29,324 --> 00:54:31,306
It's because it's not somebody's full-time job.

528
00:54:35,393 --> 00:54:38,274
A lot of these things require continuous focus.

529
00:54:38,894 --> 00:54:43,295
And, you know, the administrators on this call, there's no such thing as continuous focus for them.

530
00:54:43,435 --> 00:54:56,238
Their day is sort of like what you described, like, you know, the call comes in and, you know, and there's an emergency here and there's a, you know, something else going on over there and they have to drop everything and go.

531
00:54:56,258 --> 00:55:04,240
And that's on top of their very lengthy list of responsibilities that have nothing to do necessarily with this.

532
00:55:07,061 --> 00:55:28,095
I have felt very hamstrung as a school committee member in our ability to execute on things around this because I feel inhibited myself, not by other people, in just highly work on to our administrators that I don't want people working 16 hours a day, seven days a week.

533
00:55:29,015 --> 00:55:32,778
I'm a human being and I think everybody here is a human being and I don't think that's right.

534
00:55:34,795 --> 00:55:49,837
I hold back on things that I think are important, and as I have told other people, my list of policies and resolutions that I have written over the years that have not been submitted is now just pages long, fully written.

535
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:52,340
put them on the next agenda.

536
00:55:53,841 --> 00:55:56,302
But I know that there's only so many hours in the day.

537
00:55:57,003 --> 00:56:02,026
And most of those things, of course, are not related to what we're talking about, but some of them are.

538
00:56:02,606 --> 00:56:04,307
And I don't want to

539
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:13,346
just assume that there's going to be room in somebody's day who already, I mean, Joan, you're still at the office.

540
00:56:13,586 --> 00:56:15,167
I think Maurice, you're still at the office.

541
00:56:15,248 --> 00:56:17,329
Suzanne's at the office.

542
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:20,993
It is six o'clock, and I don't think you all arrived at 11.

543
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:33,913
from a caring human perspective, really feel like we need additional staff.

544
00:56:35,193 --> 00:56:40,835
Where they sit, who they report to isn't the most important thing to me.

545
00:56:41,255 --> 00:56:54,160
However, being able to have the school committee direct what is gonna happen, not how it's gonna happen, that's execution, but what's gonna happen and what the priorities are gonna be is really important.

546
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,661
And I do feel that

547
00:56:57,613 --> 00:57:03,278
The school committee, you know, under no circumstances has authority over you and we shouldn't.

548
00:57:03,939 --> 00:57:05,000
You work for the mayor.

549
00:57:06,722 --> 00:57:11,066
And that's, it has nothing to do with you, that statement.

550
00:57:11,486 --> 00:57:17,612
But, you know, if we pass a resolution telling you to go off and spend the next three months doing something in the schools,

551
00:57:19,213 --> 00:57:26,335
Fine, we can write that resolution and we can pass it, but you work for the mayor who will decide what you're actually going to do, not us.

552
00:57:27,696 --> 00:57:44,341
And some of this is just like, in many communities, authority in the school committee is often ceded to city councils and mayors and town committees and whoever the other,

553
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:53,304
the person who, the city manager, a lot of school committees cede their authority and just don't bat an eyelash.

554
00:57:53,764 --> 00:58:01,466
And then when they need to do something, they don't have their authority available to them to actually do their job.

555
00:58:02,287 --> 00:58:09,449
And that's what worries me about just having you do more of the work.

556
00:58:10,603 --> 00:58:17,628
for us, rather than us having somebody we can point them in the direction we want them to go.

557
00:58:17,648 --> 00:58:24,252
And they don't have to deal with an issue with the fire department or the police department or DPW.

558
00:58:24,992 --> 00:58:30,136
None of those issues will ever have anything to do with the work that they're doing in the schools.

559
00:58:35,532 --> 00:58:46,875
So that's that was has always been my concern since the very first time we started talking about this at school committee is that I want where we're elected to accomplish goals.

560
00:58:47,595 --> 00:58:56,898
And so is the mayor, but she's elected to, you know, and your point, though, that the city and the schools and like where a community is.

561
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:12,593
I agree, but Medford has transitioned a lot in the last seven years, a lot, and I feel like

562
00:59:13,912 --> 00:59:21,255
The city council knows what their actual legal authority is, the mayor knows, the school committee knows.

563
00:59:22,176 --> 00:59:28,579
When I was on, it was, nobody knew what, I mean, you know, everybody was just in each other's business.

564
00:59:29,379 --> 00:59:32,202
And then everybody let everybody be in everybody's business.

565
00:59:33,063 --> 00:59:35,745
And it just made things such a mess.

566
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:43,192
And city council was talking about the schools, and nobody could do anything because nobody knew who was responsible.

567
00:59:43,993 --> 00:59:49,878
And so I kind of have become a bit rigid in that I want to

568
00:59:51,079 --> 01:00:03,365
be very thoughtful if we cede responsibility because I have seen that when I joined the school committee where it was like, wait, is the city council still on the school committee?

569
01:00:03,405 --> 01:00:08,908
The members that have been on the school committee, are they still actually here and not on city council?

570
01:00:10,149 --> 01:00:18,573
It's, you know, this is a transitionary period for Medford and I think that that's my discomfort.

571
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:33,364
Hi, if it's okay, I'd just like to respond to that.

572
01:00:33,484 --> 01:00:39,852
So we talk about culture shift in, you know, this is where the culture shift really does begin, right?

573
01:00:39,972 --> 01:00:45,679
It is about, are we brave enough to do what we have not done before?

574
01:00:47,301 --> 01:00:51,024
The reality is that this work, you cannot dictate this work.

575
01:00:51,104 --> 01:00:52,925
This work dictates itself.

576
01:00:53,946 --> 01:01:05,235
And the reason I'm saying that is because at 11 o'clock today, you know, whilst we're all in our offices, I realized, oh my goodness, I forgot to order the plates for the event tomorrow.

577
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:07,477
People will be eating off napkins.

578
01:01:07,657 --> 01:01:11,360
You know, this, it dictates itself.

579
01:01:13,271 --> 01:01:19,113
I wouldn't so much look at it as guiding or directing the work.

580
01:01:19,273 --> 01:01:20,633
Like, what is the need?

581
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:28,796
When you have consultants and people go into spaces, what you get is a snapshot of a report.

582
01:01:29,376 --> 01:01:32,137
Nobody is in that space for six to nine months.

583
01:01:33,977 --> 01:01:37,659
A snapshot of a report for a moment in time.

584
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:39,679
That's it.

585
01:01:39,899 --> 01:01:41,740
That's really what you get.

586
01:01:43,516 --> 01:01:50,903
I personally have never found that to be the most useful way of getting information.

587
01:01:52,764 --> 01:01:59,771
How much time do respondents of the surveys put in if no relationship has been built?

588
01:02:00,932 --> 01:02:04,034
Who do they go to to answer questions?

589
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:09,019
And now I'm really talking with my DEI hat on.

590
01:02:10,633 --> 01:02:16,698
It's 2024 and we still have people who choose not to respond to the question, are you a veteran?

591
01:02:17,418 --> 01:02:19,019
Because of the stigma.

592
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:20,701
Let that sink in.

593
01:02:22,162 --> 01:02:22,522
Right?

594
01:02:23,763 --> 01:02:32,890
So, remember Russo, I can say that your points are definitely valid and your fears are valid, I hear them.

595
01:02:35,174 --> 01:02:42,218
but I would simply ask for just a little bit of trust so that we can do this the right way.

596
01:02:42,758 --> 01:02:49,802
Because at the end, it will benefit and impact our students and we want it to be better.

597
01:02:52,923 --> 01:03:00,407
The relationship I have now with my collaborative partners is far different from the relationship that I had when I first started.

598
01:03:02,122 --> 01:03:09,124
It wasn't March 2022, boom, just pick up the phone, call Suzanne, call Joan.

599
01:03:09,204 --> 01:03:16,567
This is really a trusted relationship that I hope I don't misspeak by saying I have earned this.

600
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:29,411
To be able to have some of the conversations that I have with them so that we can actually resolve issues, we can co-train, we can collaborate,

601
01:03:30,612 --> 01:03:32,714
That is a huge investment of trust.

602
01:03:35,597 --> 01:03:46,609
So I don't really know how else to put it, except for to say, I'm sorry, I was not there from the beginning and I don't know how to,

603
01:03:47,567 --> 01:03:54,534
make that better, but you cannot continue to move forward with a fragmented approach.

604
01:03:54,594 --> 01:04:06,064
That is not what DEI is, and it does create more issues down the road, and it makes it difficult for people like me, who we are on the tail end, we're not the newbies.

605
01:04:06,905 --> 01:04:08,625
This is not what we fought for.

606
01:04:08,645 --> 01:04:10,466
This is not what we envisioned.

607
01:04:11,026 --> 01:04:16,467
We have newcomers coming into our schools at an alarming rate.

608
01:04:17,087 --> 01:04:20,428
I did a training today, the 2020 census.

609
01:04:21,308 --> 01:04:25,089
Every 34 seconds, a new immigrant enters America.

610
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:28,890
That is what the 2024, 2020 census reads.

611
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:35,992
So we need this, you know, the tears are for those who don't have a voice.

612
01:04:37,338 --> 01:04:39,700
We need to show that collaboration.

613
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,621
That is the true meaning.

614
01:04:42,062 --> 01:04:46,385
If we're talking about authenticity, that is the true meaning.

615
01:04:47,406 --> 01:04:50,889
Because that collaboration is what is needed.

616
01:04:51,429 --> 01:05:00,877
When things are destabilized on the highest political platform, the school is the only safe place that some of our students have.

617
01:05:03,127 --> 01:05:11,390
and that collaboration and that partnership is needed because that says that we will not let you go because we are taking a holistic approach.

618
01:05:15,031 --> 01:05:20,694
The meals that are served, those meals are served as a result of the Civil Rights Act.

619
01:05:23,595 --> 01:05:27,476
It didn't just come to pass that school will have free meals.

620
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:32,258
McKinley-Vento, that is because of the Civil Rights Act.

621
01:05:34,028 --> 01:05:45,657
If people did not march and people did not kneel, we would have students that would not be educated today as a result of DV, because districts would fight about who's going to transport them.

622
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:52,283
Thank you.

623
01:05:53,223 --> 01:05:55,786
Superintendent, I think you might have wanted to add something.

624
01:05:55,806 --> 01:05:56,987
I want to give you an opportunity to say.

625
01:05:58,367 --> 01:05:58,887
Add your piece.

626
01:05:59,387 --> 01:05:59,828
Thank you.

627
01:05:59,988 --> 01:06:00,428
Thank you.

628
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:09,657
I, I, if you could see on my notebook, I was just jotting a few things down but as Francis was sharing.

629
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:18,696
What I wrote down was the word collaboration, which I believe strongly in and is part of my core values.

630
01:06:20,437 --> 01:06:22,619
I see Francis as a true collaborator.

631
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:38,231
And when there is a challenge or a question, just for a quick consult, it's wonderful and refreshing to know that you just have to pick up the phone and you can collaborate with a colleague

632
01:06:39,402 --> 01:06:47,389
down the street at City Hall to say, you know, this is something from your area of expertise, could you provide a little feedback?

633
01:06:48,029 --> 01:06:54,995
And I know that different members of our team for different pieces do consult and collaborate with Frances.

634
01:06:56,657 --> 01:07:02,462
And so as she was trying to quantify, and even myself, I was like, oh, it's, you know,

635
01:07:03,985 --> 01:07:11,487
It could be a quiet week and there could be a week where she's on speed dial because it could be something that's pressing.

636
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:16,488
And as you said, Member Olopade, certain things are situational.

637
01:07:18,429 --> 01:07:26,491
If someone gets injured unexpectedly or something were to happen and there is a major ADA need,

638
01:07:27,511 --> 01:07:46,771
We know we have an expert in that area that we could just call, consult, collaborate, and guide the individual to go and meet with Francis or Francis would schedule to meet with the staff person and provide the official ADA support that needs to be given.

639
01:07:47,552 --> 01:07:51,773
And so I truly do see this partnership as a collaboration.

640
01:07:51,793 --> 01:08:03,796
And I just want to thank Frances for bringing her expertise and professionalism to the table all the time to support us in different capacities.

641
01:08:04,356 --> 01:08:12,938
And sometimes it's just asking for an additional colleague to be part of the process, even when we've done select interviews.

642
01:08:14,451 --> 01:08:18,973
our own Will Piposelli, who's our new comms director.

643
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:29,257
When we were looking into bringing on a new comms director, and we partnered and collaborated with Francis at City Hall,

644
01:08:30,694 --> 01:08:36,596
and saying, you know, we want to, you know, interview candidates and really bring on someone who was going to be the best match for us.

645
01:08:37,296 --> 01:08:40,277
And that best person was in the person of Will Pitt-Vasselli.

646
01:08:41,018 --> 01:08:53,602
And that's just an example, though, of having an additional voice at the table where it was, again, an opportunity for us to collaborate and, um,

647
01:08:54,975 --> 01:08:56,916
It wasn't, we weren't mandated to do it.

648
01:08:57,016 --> 01:09:08,800
It wasn't necessary, but again, through the relationship that has built over the years, in talking with her and saying, would she like to partner with us for this particular role?

649
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:18,483
Frances has always said, yes, she was willing to lend her expertise and come to the table and help us find the best individual for the job.

650
01:09:19,904 --> 01:09:22,004
So I just wanted to restate that,

651
01:09:23,818 --> 01:09:29,298
We are truly appreciative as a district of the partnership with Francis and

652
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:38,524
Again, I know there are DEI directors and there are different models which Member Rousseau shared from many other communities.

653
01:09:40,445 --> 01:09:50,313
And some people want to collaborate and work in a true collaborative, in a true partnership, and others sometimes it's just not a match.

654
01:09:50,914 --> 01:09:58,640
But I do feel in this particular context where Medford is concerned, and what I say to you as the committee,

655
01:09:59,541 --> 01:10:09,424
our partnership, our collaboration with Francis, who is currently housed at the city of Medford in the DEI, ADA.

656
01:10:10,764 --> 01:10:12,485
I can't remember all the other letters you said.

657
01:10:13,645 --> 01:10:15,406
There were a lot of letters, alphabet soup.

658
01:10:16,086 --> 01:10:17,687
But I loved all of it.

659
01:10:18,187 --> 01:10:21,808
I truly can say that the collaboration that we have right now

660
01:10:22,828 --> 01:10:27,732
It is a true collaboration and it is worth the investment.

661
01:10:28,393 --> 01:10:51,311
And I would qualify it by saying it's in the person of Frances, who has really partnered so well with special education, with Suzanne in academics and instruction, with Peter in our operational realm, with human resources, with Janine, like really collaborating with the entire team and working with principals

662
01:10:53,212 --> 01:11:07,655
whether it's going to the Roberts and supporting DEI initiatives on a district level or at some of the particular schools where they've asked to collaborate, can we have the DEI director?

663
01:11:07,735 --> 01:11:09,715
And we say, yes, we'll let her know.

664
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:16,716
And Frances has always said she's more than willing and willing to collaborate with us.

665
01:11:17,396 --> 01:11:20,737
And she has collaborated on principal interviews.

666
01:11:21,917 --> 01:11:24,821
and just lent her expertise.

667
01:11:24,921 --> 01:11:26,703
So it is a true collaboration.

668
01:11:26,724 --> 01:11:33,372
I understand the caution that the committee is expressing.

669
01:11:34,393 --> 01:11:39,620
But in this context, I can say, rest assured,

670
01:11:41,061 --> 01:12:03,356
In the person of Frances, we do have a true collaboration and anyone in the team, you know, on the team would, I think they would confirm and say that it's how she brings herself to the work that she has really fostered and, you know, nurtured the relationship that we all have now.

671
01:12:04,016 --> 01:12:05,998
So I just wanted to add those comments.

672
01:12:06,058 --> 01:12:06,378
Thank you.

673
01:12:11,242 --> 01:12:13,062
Thank you.

674
01:12:14,443 --> 01:12:22,304
So I think that because we're starting to come down to the end time here, I'm not sure if anyone else has any other further comments that they want to just add as additional.

675
01:12:22,324 --> 01:12:28,145
We don't have any questions or comments coming from the public, it seems on my end.

676
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:33,006
So I just want to open the floor one more time before we kind of finish.

677
01:12:33,206 --> 01:12:35,366
If anyone has anything else they'd like to ask or add.

678
01:12:35,426 --> 01:12:40,587
Well, we still have our director here who can offer her understanding of the situation.

679
01:12:45,053 --> 01:12:46,014
Please, Rousseau.

680
01:12:46,934 --> 01:12:47,315
Thank you.

681
01:12:49,777 --> 01:12:56,081
So obviously, I hope there will never be an end to the collaboration.

682
01:12:56,182 --> 01:12:58,143
I would be very upset by that.

683
01:12:59,524 --> 01:13:06,609
And I certainly want to make sure that we find a way to codify the relationship.

684
01:13:08,691 --> 01:13:19,235
with the director and the schools, which I think is sort of the principle point of the motion, the resolution.

685
01:13:20,255 --> 01:13:31,659
So I certainly want to codify, which is why I offered my motion that codified it through December 31st so we could stop running in circles in that meeting, because we were going in circles.

686
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:33,800
I think that

687
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:47,952
There's one thing, though, that I feel like I want to have that I don't think we can have with Frances, not because of Frances, to be clear, but because she works for the city.

688
01:13:48,413 --> 01:13:57,121
I want somebody interacting with the students directly and being able to look at student records and being able to look at discipline issues and looking at

689
01:14:00,996 --> 01:14:10,164
student complaints about staff and staff complaints about students and and doing things that at the moment are definitely outside of the

690
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:22,554
the responsibilities as I've taken a thousand notes, but that I think is very much, that's central administration and the public schools' job.

691
01:14:23,795 --> 01:14:34,660
And so I want that, but I also don't want, not because of who the director is, but because of the bandwidth requirements.

692
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:39,142
I think if that is to happen, the bandwidth requirements are,

693
01:14:40,082 --> 01:14:40,703
are massive.

694
01:14:41,063 --> 01:14:54,973
I mean, I do not think that one human being could do both of the jobs, the job that's being done today and the job that I want to see happen.

695
01:14:57,075 --> 01:15:03,780
But I also do not want Director Nwaje to not be a part of that.

696
01:15:05,301 --> 01:15:09,244
You know, creating a professional community

697
01:15:10,553 --> 01:15:12,814
Is that what it's called in education?

698
01:15:14,114 --> 01:15:15,555
The professional, yeah, thank you.

699
01:15:15,855 --> 01:15:17,355
Learning communities, PLCs.

700
01:15:18,036 --> 01:15:21,037
Yes, that's what I'm talking about, yeah.

701
01:15:22,437 --> 01:15:33,141
You know, creating a PLC is something that I know you all talk about and school committee conferences talk about and many different articles that get forwarded to school committee members talk about.

702
01:15:33,881 --> 01:15:38,663
And having a person on both sides

703
01:15:39,814 --> 01:15:58,569
both sides is probably the wrong choice of words, but having two people creates a heck of a lot more opportunity for the sharing of knowledge and the training and the whole, you know, bouncing thoughts and ideas off of each other with enough similarities.

704
01:15:58,629 --> 01:16:03,472
And I don't know the similarities and backgrounds would be a reality, but, you know, I would want,

705
01:16:05,014 --> 01:16:13,121
It to be a collaborative process to create a job description for a school based director, which would or whatever the title would be.

706
01:16:13,841 --> 01:16:18,725
And in that job description, I would want it to include that.

707
01:16:18,745 --> 01:16:20,107
This is a colleague of.

708
01:16:21,512 --> 01:16:34,216
Director, I can, I don't remember your whole title, but that this is not a standalone position that sort of like Arlington that these are 2 folks that are working together and.

709
01:16:35,436 --> 01:16:37,937
Allowing for the school side person to.

710
01:16:39,318 --> 01:16:51,247
to be able to dig into discipline stuff and the kinds of issues that I think are really important to the school committee and I know to the administration and everybody.

711
01:16:52,388 --> 01:16:57,312
But when there's a crisis in a city department, that's not going to affect that person.

712
01:16:57,352 --> 01:16:59,373
They're still doing whatever it is.

713
01:17:03,324 --> 01:17:04,484
That's where I am.

714
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:16,828
I felt like, you know, on the floor of the school committee on whatever day it was, it's not the most, it's not the best environment for this kind of a conversation, frankly.

715
01:17:17,848 --> 01:17:21,749
Also, I don't think most of us had time to think about and prepare for that conversation.

716
01:17:22,289 --> 01:17:24,350
So I'm greatly appreciative of

717
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:35,697
everybody who's here and everything that's been said, and I would hope that there has never been a moment where anybody thought I wasn't appreciative of all the work of Director Nwaje, because that's definitely not true.

718
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:35,777
But

719
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:41,652
We have a requirement to send back a recommendation of some sort.

720
01:17:43,013 --> 01:17:53,360
And based on the motion that was made by whoever made it, so I'm just going to make this motion, which is still semi vague on purpose that we.

721
01:17:54,461 --> 01:17:58,404
Send a recommendation to the full committee that a new.

722
01:18:00,214 --> 01:18:12,941
The I like director position be created in the public schools and that the job description will include that this is a colleague of and work in collaboration with the director.

723
01:18:14,561 --> 01:18:17,082
the full title in the city.

724
01:18:17,723 --> 01:18:27,428
And I also do think that the collaboration, you know, one of the things we were talking about in the meeting was the compensation part of the stipend part.

725
01:18:27,848 --> 01:18:32,771
And I think that it does make sense now that I have, I actually have an understanding of what the director does.

726
01:18:34,332 --> 01:18:39,855
I mean, I had, you know, cursory understanding, but that that seems like an appropriate

727
01:18:40,595 --> 01:18:44,138
continuation to have that stipend be a part of the school budget.

728
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:57,310
You know, one of the things, I'm a software developer by training and there's this common mistake made in management where you will add more developers to get a project done sooner.

729
01:18:58,410 --> 01:19:02,051
And nobody remembers that the communication costs are exponential.

730
01:19:03,471 --> 01:19:09,433
And so, you know, you double the developers, you've not doubled the communication requirements, you've quadrupled it.

731
01:19:10,673 --> 01:19:13,534
And so, I don't want us to make that mistake.

732
01:19:13,954 --> 01:19:22,516
The actual communication work that Francis would have to do with a new position is real work, it has to be compensated.

733
01:19:23,236 --> 01:19:27,197
And not that I think communication would be the only work,

734
01:19:28,757 --> 01:19:30,478
So that's sort of where I am right now.

735
01:19:31,258 --> 01:19:35,399
And so that we don't just have to keep re-meeting in this subcommittee.

736
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:42,741
I think that's my recommendation and I don't have the full writing up of that, but that's why it's recorded meeting.

737
01:19:46,301 --> 01:19:51,083
Yeah, I think the thing when you saw me go, is this the right resolution for right now?

738
01:19:51,183 --> 01:19:52,263
It was me saying,

739
01:19:53,778 --> 01:20:00,500
is this, we cannot rely on Frances to do all of this work, but we can't have her not do this work either.

740
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:03,000
This collaboration is so important.

741
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:12,543
And I, you know, I put my hat on of going, I went to the strategic plan and I look at all of these objectives and initiatives and

742
01:20:13,683 --> 01:20:15,286
Only some of them are covered.

743
01:20:15,607 --> 01:20:25,044
I know they're baked into a lot of what we do as a district, but to really put that front and center, understanding who is responsible for these things.

744
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:31,514
In many of these instances, is this is this a consultation or is this a responsibility?

745
01:20:31,595 --> 01:20:44,086
And so I would like to see these are the responsibilities within the district in doing this work and how that interfaces with this valuable collaboration.

746
01:20:44,826 --> 01:20:46,468
And I do think extending.

747
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:48,730
The partnership.

748
01:20:49,731 --> 01:20:51,812
The collaboration makes sense.

749
01:20:53,034 --> 01:20:53,174
And.

750
01:20:54,805 --> 01:21:01,971
What does it mean to take it to the next level of what this looks like on the ground and with the students?

751
01:21:02,211 --> 01:21:03,272
I would support that.

752
01:21:06,393 --> 01:21:34,525
Clarify, so is the suggestion from you members, so I know you're kind of still working on the language, to bring back to the larger committee the suggestion or recommendation that we start the conversation about having a new personnel come into the schools and acting in that role while also continuing the extensive collaboration that we've been seeing thus far for Miss Nwaje and also including the stipend we discussed at the November 4th meeting and continuing that as well?

753
01:21:36,555 --> 01:21:39,276
Correct, I think I've got enough of it written down to read it.

754
01:21:39,716 --> 01:21:45,177
So to continue to extend the stipend through the end of this fiscal year?

755
01:21:45,197 --> 01:21:49,258
Well that's already, that's already, for the new budget year?

756
01:21:49,758 --> 01:22:01,221
No, we had approved this through the end of the calendar year, but to move into the fiscal year to maintain the full collaboration at this level.

757
01:22:01,281 --> 01:22:03,722
Now that we have a sense of

758
01:22:04,988 --> 01:22:32,655
what this means in practice and yeah my my um let me read the motion um is to recommend that member public schools create a new job description for a school-based dei director that will work in collaboration with the city dei director period uh further the schools will provide an annual stipend to compensate the collab uh

759
01:22:34,818 --> 01:22:43,282
to the city DEI director to compensate for the collaboration and communication with the school department.

760
01:22:44,623 --> 01:22:48,644
Because I think that's, you know, Frances has not just communicated.

761
01:22:49,085 --> 01:22:54,167
If we had a new DEI director tomorrow, she's not going to just communicate with that person.

762
01:22:54,787 --> 01:22:58,749
So I said, collaboration and communication with the school department.

763
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:02,291
And further,

764
01:23:04,618 --> 01:23:08,801
I love the word further, because it's like, you know, to deal with the fact that it doesn't make sense in English.

765
01:23:09,781 --> 01:23:25,752
Further, the, Maurice, should I put the superintendent or should I say the director of finance should make a recommendation on the appropriate stipend amount?

766
01:23:25,972 --> 01:23:29,754
I mean, we had a number that we were just like, what did we pay for the,

767
01:23:30,855 --> 01:23:33,256
The consolidation on building on me.

768
01:23:33,316 --> 01:23:33,596
Right.

769
01:23:33,816 --> 01:23:35,596
And and those are apples and oranges.

770
01:23:36,036 --> 01:23:45,959
And I don't think that whatever we were paying that makes I mean, that was the number I just used in the meeting because I wanted something to happen immediately.

771
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:52,441
And that's I mean, I didn't have time to do research as we were live on TV, but.

772
01:23:54,722 --> 01:23:59,225
Would you rather I have you assigned to do that, or should I just have the director of finance?

773
01:23:59,806 --> 01:24:05,930
You could have it as me, but I always do it in consultation when it comes to finances.

774
01:24:07,911 --> 01:24:12,614
And then working with the team, trying to quantify

775
01:24:14,458 --> 01:24:21,721
As you can see, it's hard to do that because things fluctuate, but you can put both.

776
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:24,462
I'm open to it, but I will consult with them.

777
01:24:25,062 --> 01:24:27,624
To be really clear, I don't want to nickel and dime.

778
01:24:27,664 --> 01:24:29,604
We're not trying to nickel and dime anything.

779
01:24:29,624 --> 01:24:35,927
We're trying to provide fair compensation for work that is important and happening.

780
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,482
Yeah, in my mind, it's more than the amount we've already talked about.

781
01:24:39,862 --> 01:24:44,506
But again, that's, I guess it's up to the people who will do some kind of research on this.

782
01:24:45,126 --> 01:24:48,469
So further, the superintendent will investigate and make a recommendation.

783
01:24:48,829 --> 01:24:50,550
I'm gonna skip the investigate, of course you will.

784
01:24:51,411 --> 01:24:59,497
The superintendent will make a recommendation for the stipend amount effective FY26.

785
01:25:00,538 --> 01:25:01,479
And one more further,

786
01:25:10,433 --> 01:25:12,136
Does it seem okay for everybody?

787
01:25:12,156 --> 01:25:17,608
I mean, I don't know that there is a number in anybody's mind to just...

788
01:25:18,703 --> 01:25:27,527
extend what we discussed at the last school committee through the end of the fiscal year and just, you know, use the same amount for that six-month period.

789
01:25:28,147 --> 01:25:29,468
Is that acceptable?

790
01:25:30,549 --> 01:25:39,733
Because otherwise, you'll have to come back to us before the end of the year, which, if I last looked, is like in 15 seconds, it seems, and have done that work.

791
01:25:39,953 --> 01:25:42,894
I think it's probably easier if you do that work for the next budget.

792
01:25:42,914 --> 01:25:44,095
So...

793
01:25:47,165 --> 01:25:52,188
Does that make sense to folks that we would... I don't know.

794
01:25:52,348 --> 01:25:55,570
We have two more regular meetings.

795
01:25:57,211 --> 01:25:57,672
Okay.

796
01:25:58,092 --> 01:25:58,712
That's a good point.

797
01:25:58,752 --> 01:25:59,213
We have two.

798
01:25:59,353 --> 01:26:03,995
So I don't expect anybody to spend a month doing research on this.

799
01:26:04,036 --> 01:26:15,022
So I'll just say that... I would like the reality check of, is the current stipend in the ballpark?

800
01:26:15,042 --> 01:26:15,303
Yeah.

801
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:25,261
because if it needs to be significantly more, I want to know that by December, I'd like to make that happen.

802
01:26:26,141 --> 01:26:34,283
Okay, so I'll put, we'll make a recommendation for the stipend amount by the December, one second.

803
01:26:36,863 --> 01:26:47,045
And if no, rather than we stick with what we have, we can't get a good number in that timeframe, what we have is the best we've got.

804
01:26:49,255 --> 01:26:51,276
There's a lot of furthers.

805
01:26:51,576 --> 01:26:52,196
I've read them all.

806
01:26:52,236 --> 01:26:54,237
I don't think I have to read them all again.

807
01:26:54,257 --> 01:26:59,698
Should I read it one more time?

808
01:27:00,299 --> 01:27:01,179
Do the people have to vote?

809
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:04,520
I mean, I probably, although I'm okay.

810
01:27:06,761 --> 01:27:13,463
Does this, does a within district position, does this make sense to the people in this room?

811
01:27:17,213 --> 01:27:37,198
Yes, it makes sense to me the way in which we are working and collaborating and knowing that there's opportunities for greater collaboration and more structured in a more formal way.

812
01:27:39,367 --> 01:27:43,270
you know, to meet, to reach more students, to reach more staff.

813
01:27:44,531 --> 01:27:47,914
I do feel that there's greater potential for greater collaboration.

814
01:27:47,994 --> 01:27:48,555
So, yeah.

815
01:27:48,575 --> 01:27:56,202
Because one of the things I think we heard from Francis early on is, this is what this job isn't, or this is what this consultation and this partnership is not.

816
01:27:56,762 --> 01:28:00,846
And I heard this group say, those are also things.

817
01:28:02,487 --> 01:28:03,308
Those are ands.

818
01:28:04,973 --> 01:28:07,274
not ors, but ands.

819
01:28:07,774 --> 01:28:08,435
Okay, thank you.

820
01:28:08,515 --> 01:28:11,616
I will mute myself now and let member Russo read.

821
01:28:13,177 --> 01:28:23,062
Okay, so the resolution is, this will be the recommendation to the full committee in response to the motion to come here.

822
01:28:24,422 --> 01:28:33,407
The motion is to recommend that Metro Public Schools will create a new job description for a school-based DEI director that will work in collaboration with the city DEI director

823
01:28:33,947 --> 01:28:42,573
Further, the Metro Public Schools will provide an annual stipend to the city DEI director to compensate for the collaboration and communication with the Metro Public Schools.

824
01:28:43,013 --> 01:28:48,437
Further, the superintendent will make a recommendation for the stipend amount by the December 16 meeting.

825
01:28:48,457 --> 01:28:53,460
I'm going to get to the floor.

826
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:55,562
If anybody thinks we messed up, we can just change it then.

827
01:28:55,662 --> 01:28:58,524
So that's my motion.

828
01:29:02,766 --> 01:29:03,367
I'll second it.

829
01:29:06,254 --> 01:29:12,026
So if we are all ready, so Member Reinfeldt.

830
01:29:13,249 --> 01:29:13,470
Yes.

831
01:29:14,410 --> 01:29:14,970
Mr. Russo?

832
01:29:14,990 --> 01:29:16,170
Yes.

833
01:29:16,951 --> 01:29:17,751
Mr. Lopate?

834
01:29:17,951 --> 01:29:18,271
Yes.

835
01:29:18,511 --> 01:29:20,411
That's three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

836
01:29:20,892 --> 01:29:23,532
Motion to send to full committee passes.

837
01:29:26,073 --> 01:29:30,634
If there's nothing else, I want to say thank you to everyone for sticking with us for a little over an hour and a half here.

838
01:29:31,334 --> 01:29:31,834
Thank you, Ms.

839
01:29:31,854 --> 01:29:35,495
Nwaje, for your expertise and your commitment to working with our district, and I think just

840
01:29:36,095 --> 01:29:48,626
offering your time I think it's given us on the subcommittee I think a lot to think about but I think also given us a lot more to be assured that we are working towards making the district as accepting and as compliant as possible so truly thank you.

841
01:29:48,646 --> 01:29:58,355
I appreciate being able to address this thoughtfully and not in a sudden resolution.

842
01:30:00,675 --> 01:30:03,558
Well, thank you all so much for having me.

843
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:06,260
Thank you to my collaborative partners.

844
01:30:07,141 --> 01:30:11,444
As always, it makes my world feel a lot more full.

845
01:30:13,466 --> 01:30:23,915
And I can't resist, but I just must say this, without further ado, I had to throw that further out there.

846
01:30:24,536 --> 01:30:26,478
If we're furthering the mission,

847
01:30:28,542 --> 01:30:31,446
You see, this is what happens in the DEI world.

848
01:30:31,486 --> 01:30:36,091
You think about ways in which to use words.

849
01:30:36,131 --> 01:30:37,712
But I certainly appreciate you.

850
01:30:37,752 --> 01:30:49,805
I appreciate you giving thought and making decisions that are going to have long lasting impact and really thinking about sustainability, which does come full circle.

851
01:30:50,906 --> 01:31:05,255
Education is all of our responsibilities and just knowing that many of our students are only finding their safe places in schools and with adults who are not necessarily their family members.

852
01:31:06,296 --> 01:31:12,099
It is important that we continue to do this work and continue to move forward.

853
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,241
So thank you for having me.

854
01:31:17,182 --> 01:31:18,023
Most definitely.

855
01:31:19,195 --> 01:31:21,136
motion to adjourn?

856
01:31:21,816 --> 01:31:23,156
Oh yeah is there a motion to adjourn?

857
01:31:24,477 --> 01:31:32,040
Oh no I was making I was making sure nobody else had something to say as I was speaking slowly but hearing none motion to adjourn.

858
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:35,201
Seconded by Member Russo.

859
01:31:35,301 --> 01:31:37,021
All those in favor or is that a roll call?

860
01:31:37,661 --> 01:31:38,362
Everything's roll call.

861
01:31:38,402 --> 01:31:39,942
All right it's roll call.

862
01:31:40,122 --> 01:31:41,263
All right Member Reinfeldt.

863
01:31:41,523 --> 01:31:41,703
Yes.

864
01:31:42,775 --> 01:31:43,357
Maruso?

865
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:44,201
Yes.

866
01:31:44,964 --> 01:31:45,526
Naropata?

867
01:31:45,606 --> 01:31:45,887
Yes.

868
01:31:46,088 --> 01:31:48,477
Three yeses, zero nos.

869
01:31:49,039 --> 01:31:49,722
Meeting is adjourned.

870
01:31:49,742 --> 01:31:50,344
Thank you, everybody.
