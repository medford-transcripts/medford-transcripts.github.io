Member Rousseau, can you call the roll?

10
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:05,508
Certainly.

11
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,809
Member Bramley?

12
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,270
Present.

13
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:10,092
Member Graham?

14
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:11,273
Here.

15
00:01:12,213 --> 00:01:14,435
And for the first time I'm ever saying it, Member Antapa?

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,921
I don't think we can hear you.

17
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:22,282
You're muted.

18
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:24,564
Present.

19
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:26,065
There you are.

20
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:27,546
That's right.

21
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:30,769
I don't know what's going on, but I was fine.

22
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,770
Remember all about it.

23
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:34,251
Present.

24
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:35,712
Never mind.

25
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:39,515
Do not see her on just yet.

26
00:01:40,156 --> 00:01:43,599
Okay, um, second members are present.

27
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:44,239
Mayor London.

28
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:44,279
I

29
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,288
Member Eiffel is joining us right now.

30
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:56,530
Okay, and her audio is connecting.

31
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,611
Thank you, Mayor.

32
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:04,855
And, Member Eiffel, we're taking the roll call, and I just need one more person.

33
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,696
That's you to say here.

34
00:02:08,397 --> 00:02:08,617
Here.

35
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:12,720
So, yes.

36
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:21,762
Sorry that you say that there are 7 present at 7 present 0 absent.

37
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:24,684
Members so.

38
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:32,409
Yes, I just want to remind us that rule 19 of our our members school committee rules so that we will take no votes in committees at all.

39
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,873
We have a bad past practice of just rolling with it and.

40
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:44,858
making all kinds of motions, and we literally have a rule we adopted saying we will take no votes in this meeting.

41
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:46,460
I think that's important.

42
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,524
If we want to make motions, et cetera, we can bring them to the regular meeting where votes actually matter.

43
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:55,846
So just a friendly reminder of our rules.

44
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:57,267
That's all, thank you.

45
00:02:58,028 --> 00:02:58,588
Thank you, members.

46
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:02,731
So Mayor Edward, sorry, Mayor Edward Vincent, oh my goodness.

47
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:06,074
Dr. Edward Vincent, would you like to lead us off?

48
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:10,740
Oh, you're on mute.

49
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,401
Thank you.

50
00:03:13,282 --> 00:03:14,923
The same situation happened to me.

51
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:16,064
Good evening, everyone.

52
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:20,748
I want to extend a very warm welcome to Mr. John and Tafa.

53
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:23,730
Thank you for joining the team today.

54
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,254
And we look forward to continuing our work together collaboratively.

55
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,855
So welcome aboard.

56
00:03:30,956 --> 00:03:35,199
This evening, this is our first budget committee of the whole.

57
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:46,606
I want to just point out that this evening's presentation will be taking place by Mr. Jerry McHugh, who is our finance director at Medford Public Schools.

58
00:03:46,906 --> 00:03:48,167
He has been working

59
00:03:49,627 --> 00:04:14,118
incredibly hard in collaboration with the mayor and city hall and I think our vice chair Graham and member Rousseau who have been working and just providing consult and so I would like to pass the baton on to Mr. McHugh so he can begin his budget update for the committee and Mr. McHugh is going to

60
00:04:15,278 --> 00:04:30,407
present, um, I should ask, uh, Mr. McHugh, do you want to do all of your presentation first and then, um, take questions at the end or, um, pause in between the different pieces of presentations?

61
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:31,067
Yeah.

62
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:36,010
Um, I, I don't mind taking questions as we go along.

63
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:41,493
I think tonight's meeting was going to be focused on, um, um,

64
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:46,526
Revenue that's available for our budget.

65
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,048
So it probably makes sense.

66
00:04:50,068 --> 00:05:02,513
We'll be talking about Chapter 70, revolving funds, private grants, the idea of charging programs for overhead.

67
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:07,496
So it might make sense to take the questions as they go along.

68
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:12,758
But whatever the preference of the committee is, is what I'll do.

69
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:16,405
Thank you.

70
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:21,228
Is there anything else you would like me to share, Member Graham?

71
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:22,429
No.

72
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,751
Why don't we let you get started, Jerry?

73
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:36,238
And then if there are stopping points, why don't you just let us know where those good stopping points are in your presentation, and we can stop and ask questions.

74
00:05:36,598 --> 00:05:43,302
With your permission, I thought I could give maybe a five-minute update on the FY24 shortfall.

75
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:53,501
just because we had some, made some progress in that area, would that be okay?

76
00:05:57,243 --> 00:05:57,503
Yes.

77
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:04,867
Okay.

78
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:09,950
A couple of meetings ago, I came up to the committee.

79
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,312
We finally were able to run some year-end projections and

80
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:23,657
were concerned about a $2.5 million shortfall that was showing up at that time.

81
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:43,172
I felt it prudent to advise a committee at that time of that potential shortfall, but then we went to work to see what other resources we could bring to bear.

82
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:56,132
working with the city's finance director, Bob Dickerson, and of course the mayor, you know, we were able to identify

83
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:01,275
a grant for homeless transportation.

84
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:06,959
You know, we determined a potential balance from ESSA funds that we could use.

85
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:13,705
Um, we have some circuit breaker funds for special ed tuition that we could use.

86
00:07:14,546 --> 00:07:19,810
We created a charge back for food service to recover, uh, utility expenses.

87
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,532
And, and we came up with about $1.7 million of, um,

88
00:07:25,757 --> 00:07:32,663
potential resources that we could bring to bear.

89
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:50,518
The finance director was generous with his time and reviewed the spreadsheet and actually identified a problem with one of the formulas in the projection.

90
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:53,780
So the formula was picking up

91
00:07:54,963 --> 00:08:01,405
most of the accounts that were showing a deficit, but was leaving out some accounts that were showing surplus.

92
00:08:01,445 --> 00:08:10,507
So once we made that fix, the deficit that we're looking at is about half a million dollars now.

93
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:19,189
And the fiscal year 23 budget is still open.

94
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:22,510
And we've requested that the city

95
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:33,785
apply a Teamsters, the third payment of a Teamsters union president that goes back to FY22.

96
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:45,632
And it's worth $255,000 and that hit in FY24, but it's really properly charged to FY23.

97
00:08:45,953 --> 00:08:52,157
So if they make that adjustment, we get the projected deficit down to 250 and that is

98
00:08:53,297 --> 00:08:57,760
quite manageable with the resources that we've been able to identify.

99
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:03,803
So I don't know if anyone has any questions.

100
00:09:03,863 --> 00:09:11,868
There's some new members on the board since that time, so I'd be happy to respond to any questions.

101
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,872
Mayor, did you want to take over or did you want me to?

102
00:09:20,992 --> 00:09:21,252
I can.

103
00:09:21,292 --> 00:09:27,094
I'm not sure if this question is without any sort of presentation on that 500 number, Jerry.

104
00:09:27,114 --> 00:09:29,754
So do you have anything in your presentation on that?

105
00:09:31,315 --> 00:09:32,615
I do not.

106
00:09:32,815 --> 00:09:35,236
This just kind of all came together this afternoon.

107
00:09:35,356 --> 00:09:43,658
But I mean, I have my spreadsheet that I use for projections is quite lengthy.

108
00:09:43,678 --> 00:09:43,718
OK.

109
00:09:48,818 --> 00:09:54,222
Yeah, I think the bottom line is that we'll be able to manage through.

110
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:56,603
We're going to finish the year with a balanced budget.

111
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:13,155
But if there's anything in particular that you would want, I mean, we're going to be running this projection once or twice a month anyway, because things change.

112
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:27,942
The teacher's contract, the administrator's contract, and the nurse's contract all have a 1% increase that's going to hit at the end of the month.

113
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:34,366
So after those go through, that would be a good time to take another projection.

114
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:48,555
We've anticipated, you know, we have some estimated numbers for the cost of that, but, you know, it'd be best to get the actual costs, you know, baked into the projections.

115
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:50,156
Okay.

116
00:10:51,296 --> 00:10:51,797
Thank you, Jerry.

117
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:57,900
But thank you for your help, Mayor, in kind of working through this problem.

118
00:10:58,501 --> 00:10:58,661
Yep.

119
00:10:58,701 --> 00:10:59,982
Thank you for your hard work as well.

120
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:02,463
Member Brantley, then Member Graham.

121
00:11:04,578 --> 00:11:06,299
I just want to make sure I'm hearing this correctly.

122
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,921
So the $2.5 million that we once heard is now down to approximately $250,000?

123
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:11,422
Yes.

124
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:14,603
Can we do a dance?

125
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:18,125
Because I haven't slept in years.

126
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:19,046
No.

127
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:19,926
No.

128
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:20,747
Yay!

129
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:21,387
Yay!

130
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:22,148
This is great news.

131
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:24,969
Why aren't we all screaming and dancing?

132
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:25,549
I'm sweating.

133
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:26,590
Yay!

134
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,792
Still half a million, but yeah, we made great progress.

135
00:11:30,332 --> 00:11:30,512
Yeah.

136
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:41,767
encumbrances, we were over encumbered in one account, and that was a savings of $265,000.

137
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:55,992
We adjusted some of our biweekly payroll amounts that we are using in the projections to be closer to current.

138
00:11:56,773 --> 00:12:02,335
And then the biggest difference was this error in the

139
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:13,462
formula that was adding up the accounts that were in deficit.

140
00:12:15,264 --> 00:12:16,725
I've never been so happy about a mistake.

141
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,246
It worked out.

142
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:30,677
I'm a little bit, I don't want to say embarrassed is too strong, but I wish the problem didn't happen in the first place.

143
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:34,014
It could have went the other way too, so I'm grateful.

144
00:12:37,737 --> 00:12:38,618
It just worked out.

145
00:12:38,638 --> 00:12:49,588
But I think it's just an example of any kind of little problem in this budget is kind of magnified.

146
00:12:50,849 --> 00:12:57,115
But I'm totally, I'm gonna sleep well tonight and we'll finish the year with a balanced budget.

147
00:12:57,897 --> 00:12:58,577
Okay, thank you.

148
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:04,441
I think we scheduled this from five to six, so we're gonna go to member Graham, then member Reinfeld, I see your hand up, then we're gonna go to your presentation.

149
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:06,162
Okay.

150
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:07,363
Thank you.

151
00:13:08,544 --> 00:13:24,814
Sherry, I wondered, I know that you generally don't attend our school committee meetings on Mondays, but I was hoping maybe you could just write a report and submit that as an agenda item so that somebody can read that for the record in our main meeting.

152
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:32,319
And I'm going to hold any sort of additional questions and comments until then because this isn't on the agenda for today.

153
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:52,672
But since I know that you generally aren't able to join those meetings, I did want to say thank you for being proactive about telling us because we could easily find ourselves in the situation that Brockton is finding themselves in right now with massive surprises of deficits with everybody asleep at the wheel.

154
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:56,695
I don't think you should feel embarrassed.

155
00:13:56,755 --> 00:14:05,099
Thank you for being diligent and for informing the committee, because I think that is what we all want and need.

156
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:06,119
So thank you.

157
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,683
And then, Member Russo, I think Noah Urasko has joined us, so if you can add him to the roll call.

158
00:14:12,843 --> 00:14:13,103
Thank you.

159
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:15,128
That's it.

160
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:15,808
Great.

161
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:16,449
Member Reinfeldt.

162
00:14:17,169 --> 00:14:20,810
I was just going to thank Jerry again for being proactive and say, don't be embarrassed.

163
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,431
We'd rather get the information sooner.

164
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:23,691
Yes.

165
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,392
We all make mistakes all the time.

166
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:27,293
Thank you.

167
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:27,673
Thank you.

168
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:28,133
Yeah.

169
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:29,013
Great news.

170
00:14:29,614 --> 00:14:31,214
We'll turn it over to you, Jerry.

171
00:14:31,274 --> 00:14:31,594
Thank you.

172
00:14:31,754 --> 00:14:32,055
OK.

173
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:33,115
All right.

174
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:43,179
So, you know, one of the key sources of revenue or, you know,

175
00:14:46,037 --> 00:14:51,040
resources that we have for, I don't know if they, let me see.

176
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:57,424
Are you, let's see.

177
00:14:58,045 --> 00:14:59,165
Can you see my screen?

178
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:00,546
Not yet.

179
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:01,927
Yes, it's coming.

180
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:02,808
Okay, all right.

181
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:14,655
So, historically, you know, the Chapter 70 isn't a big source of revenue for

182
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:23,370
uh, Medford, um, like it might be in other communities that have a high, low income population.

183
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:32,953
Um, but nevertheless, it does outline, you know, kind of the minimum spending, um, that a school district should be spending.

184
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:42,536
And it identifies that and, uh, you know, allocates a share that the city's expected to contribute

185
00:15:43,382 --> 00:15:48,003
And then the state contributes another amount.

186
00:15:48,183 --> 00:15:55,466
So I thought it might be useful just to look at kind of the last few years of Chapter 70.

187
00:15:56,006 --> 00:16:02,808
If you go back to FY23, our foundation enrollment, which includes

188
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:11,352
not only MedFed public school students, but MedFed students attending charter schools as well.

189
00:16:11,852 --> 00:16:14,712
So charter schools is part of the Chapter 70 formula.

190
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:21,354
And the city gets a bill every year for charter school tuition for those students.

191
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:26,154
The state calculated a foundation budget of $64.9 million in 23.

192
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:38,864
They determined the city should contribute $51 million, and then $13.9 would come from Chapter 70.

193
00:16:39,484 --> 00:16:49,910
And this net school spending is something that we have to report at the end of the year to show that we met our net school spending target.

194
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:55,313
Now, in MedFed, you're fortunate that the city

195
00:16:59,031 --> 00:17:10,715
picks up the health insurance for active employees and retirees that are attributable to Medford Public Schools, and they pay for the charter school tuition.

196
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:24,820
So every year we are gonna hit this med school spending target because the city routinely contributes more than they're required to.

197
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:24,880
In 24,

198
00:17:29,672 --> 00:17:35,695
It was a pretty good year for MedFed because the foundation enrollment went up by over 100 students.

199
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:39,076
And again, that could include charter school as well.

200
00:17:40,697 --> 00:17:42,918
Our foundation budget went up $6.9 million.

201
00:17:44,822 --> 00:17:53,246
And then that was basically, that $6.9 million increase was split between the city and Chapter 70.

202
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:59,009
So there was a $3.5 million increase in Chapter 70 that year.

203
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,151
Then we forward to FY25.

204
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:10,654
And this is based on the governor's budget that is working its way through the House.

205
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:13,185
change a little bit.

206
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:19,470
It doesn't change too drastically, but it could change a little bit after it goes through the legislature.

207
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:25,935
But between FY24 and FY25, our enrollment actually went down.

208
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:31,800
And our foundation budget went up by 1.7.

209
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:38,285
The city's required contribution went up by almost 2.8 million.

210
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:41,788
But because our enrollment went down,

211
00:18:42,366 --> 00:18:51,532
because the Chapter 70 money has a hold harmless provision.

212
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:58,276
So instead of going down, which it should have, down to about $16 million, it stayed the same.

213
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:02,179
And then we qualify for what's called minimum aid.

214
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,160
It's a per student amount.

215
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,201
I think it's $35 per student.

216
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:07,642
And so our Chapter 70 increased.

217
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:11,451
by 135,000.

218
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:19,554
And the net school spending increased by the total of the district contribution in the 135,000.

219
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:22,255
So that went up 2.9.

220
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:40,762
I also did an analysis of our school budget versus our net school spending, just to kind of get a sense of what typically happens in MedFed.

221
00:19:41,361 --> 00:19:47,584
So our school budget has always increased during the year.

222
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:54,687
We had a big increase in FY22, a smaller increase in FY21.

223
00:19:54,847 --> 00:20:01,491
And our net school spending in relation to the school budget

224
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:13,696
typically is going up, but in a couple of years, our budget was actually less than the net school spending budget.

225
00:20:14,436 --> 00:20:18,020
But just kind of data points on Chapter 70.

226
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:27,509
I could spend a little bit of time on how Chapter 70 works for some of the new members, but I don't want to take up too much time.

227
00:20:33,637 --> 00:20:34,739
So happy to answer.

228
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:38,164
This might be a good time just to answer any questions on Chapter 70.

229
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,346
All right.

230
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:40,628
Member Graham.

231
00:20:40,648 --> 00:20:42,271
Thank you.

232
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:53,682
I will reconnect about scheduling some time with Tracy Novick to do a real deep dive on Chapter 70 for all of us.

233
00:20:54,823 --> 00:20:59,984
Now that we have a new member on board, we'll get his availability and figure out a time to do that.

234
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:13,347
But Jerry, a couple of things that I've been watching in the news is that two points of concern about Chapter 70 is one, the rate of inflation that was assigned in the governor's budget, which was like

235
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:16,048
1.5%, I want to say.

236
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:22,710
And people feeling like that's considerably lower than what actual inflation represents.

237
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:30,433
But the other thing that people are talking about is a pretty substantial reduction in students being considered low income.

238
00:21:30,954 --> 00:21:36,796
There's actually a list of communities where the drop was significant.

239
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:42,078
And I didn't see us on that list, but I was just curious if you have any insights about

240
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:45,299
how our low income enrollment numbers are changing.

241
00:21:45,319 --> 00:22:07,209
I mean, I know they're sort of attributing it to the mass health redetermination among other things, but I was just curious what our low income numbers look like and if we feel like those sound representative of our population or if there is a gap there, much like our SNAP gap.

242
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:11,868
Yeah, let me.

243
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:33,893
Just going to call up another spreadsheet, but what, yeah, the, you know, years ago all,

244
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:42,303
All districts used a paper process to identify loan.

245
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,064
It was tied to the lunch fund.

246
00:22:46,044 --> 00:22:58,407
Since we have gone to community eligibility, everybody qualifies for free lunch.

247
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:03,048
That led the state to try to come up with a different

248
00:23:05,798 --> 00:23:19,408
methodology, and it's based on identifying people that are on various benefit programs within the state.

249
00:23:19,548 --> 00:23:28,515
And it just doesn't pick up everybody for some reason, particularly recently arrived immigrants.

250
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:38,384
Even if you're a legal immigrant here, you're barred from receiving benefits for five years.

251
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:42,505
So they've been trying to work around that.

252
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:46,746
But I will try to do some more research on that.

253
00:23:46,966 --> 00:23:54,007
But essentially, this is how, can everybody see this screen, FY25 Chapter 70 Foundation Budget?

254
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:56,587
We can't see your screen right now.

255
00:23:57,248 --> 00:23:57,748
You cannot?

256
00:23:58,528 --> 00:23:58,708
No.

257
00:23:59,328 --> 00:23:59,448
OK.

258
00:24:04,838 --> 00:24:05,238
Here it comes.

259
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:05,879
Good.

260
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:06,479
OK.

261
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:20,510
So this part of the foundation budget is kind of what's the base budget based on all of our students.

262
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:31,578
And then every community gets an incremental increase over and above the base for the foundation.

263
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:33,519
Now, it's not an increase in Chapter 78,

264
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,552
it's an increase in your budget.

265
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:50,403
So because you have special needs students, English language learners, low income students, it's assumed that you need to spend more money because these students are more needy.

266
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:59,730
But if you look over here on column 19, this is the count of low income students that we have in Medford Public Schools.

267
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,211
So if we have 4,200,

268
00:25:06,813 --> 00:25:09,735
Students, that's about 40%, 45%.

269
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:14,459
There's another.

270
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,741
So we are in a group eight category.

271
00:25:19,123 --> 00:25:21,184
You see this blue box over here.

272
00:25:21,204 --> 00:25:24,647
43% of our students are low income.

273
00:25:25,648 --> 00:25:30,992
That qualifies us for group eight, and that dictates

274
00:25:33,202 --> 00:25:37,445
you know, how much of a bump up we're going to get for low income.

275
00:25:37,665 --> 00:25:45,570
So the very neediest communities get a much bigger increase for their low-income students.

276
00:25:47,211 --> 00:25:52,134
But this is where we are, group eight.

277
00:25:52,194 --> 00:26:00,600
So our foundation budget increases by $12.5 million due to our low-income students.

278
00:26:03,907 --> 00:26:12,314
And this is where we should be spending money on interventionists and tutoring.

279
00:26:12,435 --> 00:26:17,659
And we qualify for Title I in some of our schools because of this.

280
00:26:25,386 --> 00:26:25,706
Thank you.

281
00:26:28,326 --> 00:26:28,666
Thank you.

282
00:26:28,746 --> 00:26:29,506
Member Rousseau?

283
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,047
I can go back and figure out.

284
00:26:31,227 --> 00:26:34,968
I can do some trending on that too to see what the trend is.

285
00:26:37,189 --> 00:26:37,749
Member Rousseau?

286
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,050
Thank you.

287
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:45,572
Chair, when you were showing the budget for the last few years,

288
00:26:48,922 --> 00:26:53,646
Almost everybody who was here certainly remembers the level funded year of FY21.

289
00:26:53,786 --> 00:27:09,559
And I realized that we did have a supplemental, the state hadn't even finished their budget, so we level funded, and I believe there was a supplemental, and your numbers reflected an increase, which we never approved a supplemental as a school committee.

290
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:16,304
And I'm just, because I am often looking at the data from DESE, and I cannot find the number that you showed

291
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:41,836
anywhere online i believe you have access to you know the login and all that to versions of portals that the public doesn't is that where you get the number that you are showing not on this one but the uh the last yeah five years of budget um this one yes yes so that fy21 number we

292
00:27:44,948 --> 00:27:48,551
We actually approved in our budget 61,250.

293
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:49,992
That's what we approved.

294
00:27:50,673 --> 00:27:50,993
OK.

295
00:27:52,314 --> 00:27:58,059
But I don't doubt that your number is right, because I heard that there was a supplemental.

296
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:00,201
That's as much as I ever heard about it.

297
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:04,004
Yeah, I'd have to go back.

298
00:28:04,124 --> 00:28:11,390
And I might have just gotten them off of budgets that I found in the office here.

299
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:16,991
Because I, I did look at my own copies of budgets and never saw that number.

300
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:19,453
And just in your 1, 2nd, I want to write it down.

301
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:19,453
3, 3, 9, 537.

302
00:28:22,056 --> 00:28:32,365
Okay, if you, if you, I know you're ridiculously busy, but I really would like to know where that number came from because.

303
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,141
These are really, really important.

304
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:36,982
Yeah, FY21.

305
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:46,671
Because, you know, this trending stuff is a constant conversation that I certainly have with others, and having the same numbers matters.

306
00:28:47,031 --> 00:28:47,351
Thank you.

307
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,232
Okay.

308
00:28:48,973 --> 00:28:49,133
Yep.

309
00:28:49,433 --> 00:28:55,458
You can continue, Jerry.

310
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:55,838
Thank you.

311
00:28:56,939 --> 00:28:57,300
Okay.

312
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,683
So, the next thing that I'm looking at,

313
00:29:02,094 --> 00:29:06,237
Maybe we'll look at revolving funds.

314
00:29:07,317 --> 00:29:09,739
So let's see.

315
00:29:23,648 --> 00:29:30,773
So the city, I mean, the school department has a number of revolving funds that they use.

316
00:29:33,018 --> 00:29:42,526
which provides some resources to the school department budget to run programs.

317
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:48,971
This MEET program is a tuition-based program.

318
00:29:51,253 --> 00:29:54,116
I'd have to go back in the years.

319
00:29:55,157 --> 00:29:58,319
I'm going to try to spend my time over the next

320
00:29:59,078 --> 00:30:00,819
three weeks kind of looking forward.

321
00:30:00,879 --> 00:30:07,102
But when we have some time, we can go back to see why some of these balances were accumulated.

322
00:30:07,162 --> 00:30:26,332
But certainly, this is an area where we could charge staff that are assigned to the MEVE program and not use those, you know, save those salaries from being charged to the general fund budget.

323
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:48,352
The vocational school has a number of revolving funds that they use because they provide services to parents and other individuals in MedFed.

324
00:30:48,412 --> 00:30:52,775
And this gives them a chance to have a real world experience in their education.

325
00:30:52,795 --> 00:30:57,538
So there's a cosmetology program.

326
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:02,832
Marketing, there's culinary, the bistro.

327
00:31:03,572 --> 00:31:12,657
Here at the high school, there's a coffee program, automotive program, and a graphics group.

328
00:31:12,917 --> 00:31:15,679
And then there's this category, tuition.

329
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:23,503
So in years past, MedFed

330
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:29,359
was a program that was accessed by a lot of students outside of MEDFED.

331
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,641
And they would pay tuition to MEDFED.

332
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:33,021
It would go into this account.

333
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:48,352
Because the program is popular with our own students now, there's little room to accept students from other schools.

334
00:31:49,048 --> 00:31:49,568
outside.

335
00:31:49,588 --> 00:32:02,615
So there's a few students that are tuitioned in that are still going through the program, but this program as a source of revenue will eventually just dry up.

336
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:07,877
But this provides an opportunity for us to charge some teacher salaries if we want.

337
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:08,718
The

338
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:26,130
This account typically contributed about $150,000 to supply needs for the vocational school in addition to what was provided in the general fund and because this account is

339
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:46,934
not producing more revenue, I think we're going to try to bring more of that supply expense into the general fund so we eventually don't kind of have a fiscal cliff with the supply budget of the vocational program.

340
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:56,277
Then we have a separate account for the rental charges for the Edgley Field.

341
00:32:57,385 --> 00:33:07,207
So any personnel that's assigned to that field when it's in use gets charged to this account.

342
00:33:08,267 --> 00:33:14,648
And of course, the lighting expenses and maintenance of the field, that all gets charged to this account.

343
00:33:15,448 --> 00:33:21,129
Now, I'm told that there was an intentional

344
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:34,706
strategy to build up the fund in this account so it would be available when the field had to be replaced.

345
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:40,052
So there is a good balance.

346
00:33:40,232 --> 00:33:50,242
If that field was replaced, it certainly wouldn't cover the cost of the entire field, but it might cover costs of design and project management.

347
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:59,063
And then we have the school lunch fund, which provides lunches to our students.

348
00:33:59,143 --> 00:34:04,865
And that fund is self-sustaining.

349
00:34:05,005 --> 00:34:08,666
So most of the money comes in federal reimbursement.

350
00:34:08,866 --> 00:34:11,827
A small amount comes from state reimbursement.

351
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:15,548
And that balance is in good shape.

352
00:34:17,778 --> 00:34:25,784
School athletics as well, we charge fees to our students to participate in sports.

353
00:34:27,325 --> 00:34:30,307
It certainly does not cover the entire cost of sports.

354
00:34:30,387 --> 00:34:43,156
There's a budget in the general fund that covers most of the expenses, but this provides some opportunity to charge some of the expenses that we have in athletics to this fund.

355
00:34:44,537 --> 00:34:47,319
Community schools is another area where we

356
00:34:50,748 --> 00:34:58,392
renting our facilities like the Japanese language school, churches that use the facilities.

357
00:35:00,013 --> 00:35:13,600
Right now, you know, it's a little concerning that we're running a deficit right now in this account, but I want to say that with these accounts, the revenues tend to lag.

358
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:18,154
The expenses, the expenses more or less happen in real time.

359
00:35:20,757 --> 00:35:32,046
And the revenues eventually, you know, have to get up to city treasury and get deposited into the correct account.

360
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:33,768
But we have to keep an eye on that.

361
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:41,835
There's also a driver's ed program where we charge students to have their

362
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:47,473
driver's ed program to get their license.

363
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:52,295
It pays for a couple of staff members.

364
00:35:54,237 --> 00:35:56,378
And that's most of the charges to this account.

365
00:35:56,718 --> 00:35:59,760
And there is a good balance in that account as well.

366
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:06,984
We also charge students and staff if they lose or damage their Chromebooks.

367
00:36:10,026 --> 00:36:11,426
Those all go into a fund.

368
00:36:13,847 --> 00:36:22,172
and are available to refurbish computers or to buy replacements.

369
00:36:25,814 --> 00:36:36,921
Summer School is another account where there's fees charged for, I guess, credit recovery programs.

370
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:42,905
This is another account that's in deficit, so it could be that

371
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:56,489
Obviously, it could be that we haven't fully deposited the proceeds there, but we are showing a deficit in that program.

372
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:14,721
This vocational early ed program is a small early childhood program that's run out of the book for students that are pursuing teaching or

373
00:37:18,913 --> 00:37:22,094
similar types of career paths within teaching.

374
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:29,836
So there's charges made and a little bit of expense made, but there's balance in that account as well.

375
00:37:33,797 --> 00:37:42,499
Preschool, this... I believe it might be MFN, Jerry.

376
00:37:43,499 --> 00:37:43,919
MFN?

377
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:45,300
Medford Family Network.

378
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:46,940
Okay, thank you.

379
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:52,651
There are a few accounts here from Medford Family Network.

380
00:37:54,032 --> 00:38:08,760
Now, Medford Family Network is kind of a completely separate program from Medford Public Schools, but we operate more or less as a fiscal agent to them.

381
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:18,125
And so we accept their grants, we provide some accounting and payroll.

382
00:38:19,445 --> 00:38:25,207
HR, all those support services are provided by Medford Public Schools.

383
00:38:26,467 --> 00:38:33,409
And then the pool has its own rental fees and membership charges.

384
00:38:35,289 --> 00:38:45,492
The pool, we need to really take a look at how that's staffed and the hours that are open.

385
00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:51,932
really kind of back of the envelope assessment when I first got here.

386
00:38:51,992 --> 00:39:03,919
And I just think we're only, we lose about $20 an hour every time we're open.

387
00:39:03,959 --> 00:39:07,181
We're open a lot of hours early in the morning, late at night.

388
00:39:08,022 --> 00:39:09,083
We do have some good,

389
00:39:10,832 --> 00:39:12,653
revenue from different schools.

390
00:39:13,173 --> 00:39:21,295
A lot of schools don't have pools, so some schools are coming to MedFed to use our facility for their swim program.

391
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:34,760
But that really needs a kind of a management review to make sure that that can run in the black every year.

392
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:51,953
This short tuition account is another account similar to vocational tuition where in years past, we used to tuition in students to the Curtis Tufts program.

393
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:58,055
And we haven't done that in recent years.

394
00:39:59,046 --> 00:40:09,409
And, but we did accumulate a balance and we use that balance on and off to support the special ed program here at Bedford.

395
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:17,971
Kids Corner is another program that's kind of is, should be self-sustaining.

396
00:40:18,051 --> 00:40:22,852
It's the daycare program that's available to staff.

397
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:24,913
It's located here in the high school.

398
00:40:27,596 --> 00:40:30,858
The evening school is no longer in use.

399
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:38,342
I think this small deficit is from a prior year, and I think it's probably just missed.

400
00:40:39,242 --> 00:40:41,203
It's a missed posting to this account.

401
00:40:41,404 --> 00:40:45,526
So we'll have to do a journal entry to clean that up.

402
00:40:45,566 --> 00:40:48,507
But we no longer run an evening program.

403
00:40:48,968 --> 00:40:56,031
And then the before and after school program is a good moneymaker for the school department.

404
00:40:58,258 --> 00:41:03,843
So it just has accumulated a large balance over the years.

405
00:41:06,866 --> 00:41:19,156
It's running in the red this year, but that's, again, I think the revenues are lagging and the expenses are more in real time.

406
00:41:19,216 --> 00:41:23,280
So that will finish up in a positive amount.

407
00:41:25,185 --> 00:41:34,407
But those are all the revolving funds that we operate in MedFed, and I'd be happy to answer any questions people might have on that.

408
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,048
This is great, Jerry.

409
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:38,448
Thank you.

410
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:44,230
Member Reinfeld and Member Rousseau and Member Graham.

411
00:41:49,387 --> 00:41:50,708
Okay, thank you, Jerry.

412
00:41:51,928 --> 00:41:56,150
So I am curious when the lags will catch up.

413
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:01,291
So when we'll know whether these numbers are lasting or temporary.

414
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:06,814
And then I guess my other question is what ability do we have to see what the trends are?

415
00:42:06,854 --> 00:42:15,817
Cause I'm seeing a lot of net losses and I'm curious how many of those are perpetuating from year to year and how many are anomalies?

416
00:42:15,837 --> 00:42:15,877
So.

417
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,520
I can get that.

418
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:22,122
There are a couple of accounts that are like the pool.

419
00:42:23,162 --> 00:42:42,333
And what happens usually is, and I don't really have a good handle here because I wasn't here last year, but if you had, for instance, a deficit in this vocational carpentry,

420
00:42:43,100 --> 00:43:02,054
which is really, this happened prior to FY24, but the vocational school has been kind of running all the carpentry revenue expenses recently through the vocational tuition account, and we just kind of reactivated this fund.

421
00:43:02,854 --> 00:43:09,299
The students build sheds for different organizations,

422
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:11,742
So they're able to sell those sheds.

423
00:43:11,782 --> 00:43:13,603
So that's going to kind of correct itself.

424
00:43:13,703 --> 00:43:24,790
But if we finish the year with that and we had bandwidth in our general fund to absorb that, we would do a journal entry to get that account corrected.

425
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:32,535
But that's probably typically what happened in years past.

426
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:37,818
There were accounting maneuvers at the end to kind of get everything into balance.

427
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:49,807
Because the city's director of finance is going to send me a report and says, I have to get these accounts in balance to close my book.

428
00:43:49,907 --> 00:43:55,689
So there's an effort made in August and September to get those straightened out.

429
00:43:56,149 --> 00:44:00,291
But what we're going to do is we're going to try to take a look at

430
00:44:03,811 --> 00:44:09,294
The individual departments keep track of their deposits to the city treasury.

431
00:44:09,354 --> 00:44:19,881
So we're going to go back and look at those figures to make sure that everything we deposited with the treasury is hitting the right account.

432
00:44:20,362 --> 00:44:21,723
So that would be the first step.

433
00:44:24,224 --> 00:44:26,966
And then we'll go from there.

434
00:44:27,026 --> 00:44:30,289
But we can go back a few years and identify

435
00:44:32,945 --> 00:44:34,506
if there's any problem areas.

436
00:44:35,007 --> 00:44:43,554
Yeah, we don't wanna be in a situation where we're like routinely bailing out these different revolving funds.

437
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:59,807
And if they're consistently running a deficit, we have to look at the revenue structure and like with the pool, with the community schools, we're looking at the rates that we're gonna charge

438
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:09,688
Athletics is another account, are those rates kind of keeping up with the increases in our expenses?

439
00:45:09,768 --> 00:45:12,910
So that's what we'll be looking at.

440
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:20,717
For this cycle or for, what's the timing on looking at that?

441
00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:24,460
Well, as soon as we get the budget

442
00:45:25,562 --> 00:45:33,846
And then when we're done, uh, finished, then we were, you know, our attention is going to be turned towards, you know, year end activities and we were going to, uh.

443
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:42,150
And we want to kind of spend make sure we're spending a general fund and make sure these revolving funds are in balance.

444
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:43,511
So Great.

445
00:45:43,631 --> 00:45:44,051
Thank you.

446
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:44,911
It's more or less

447
00:45:56,512 --> 00:45:57,773
Thank you, Jerry.

448
00:45:57,813 --> 00:46:03,159
This is excellent work and I really appreciate having it in front of us so we can really see this.

449
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:09,567
I believe the Japanese school pays even more than the revenues listed for community schools.

450
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:19,565
If their annual contribution, their annual payment is more than that number, I think somebody should figure out where that money went.

451
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:24,329
But you did indicate that there was work to be done there.

452
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:29,173
But I think that their annual payment is greatly in excess of the revenue shown.

453
00:46:29,213 --> 00:46:31,896
So I'm a little concerned about that.

454
00:46:33,397 --> 00:46:39,362
All that money at the time it was collected went into community schools account?

455
00:46:40,342 --> 00:46:43,944
And I think what they do is they prepay for a number of years.

456
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:52,290
So that is something that also has to be watched.

457
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,432
So you don't want to, you know, they're overpaying in the first year.

458
00:46:56,973 --> 00:47:07,159
You don't want to use that surplus for other things because you're committed to providing them the space, you know, for the next three years.

459
00:47:10,524 --> 00:47:11,464
Okay.

460
00:47:11,604 --> 00:47:12,545
Point well taken.

461
00:47:13,305 --> 00:47:13,865
No, thank you.

462
00:47:13,885 --> 00:47:14,626
I didn't know they did it.

463
00:47:14,686 --> 00:47:15,926
That's really useful information.

464
00:47:17,547 --> 00:47:25,410
The pool revenue, I'm glad to see that other schools that are using our facilities are paying as well.

465
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:34,073
I guess the question, and obviously our students shouldn't be paying to use the pool to do the things like, you know, swimming and all that stuff.

466
00:47:34,173 --> 00:47:36,374
But I guess, you know,

467
00:47:37,892 --> 00:47:43,477
My question is, are we just charging entirely ridiculously low rates to the public who wants to come in and use our pool?

468
00:47:43,557 --> 00:47:47,921
Because frankly, it's like the best kept secret in Medford is that our pool is fabulous.

469
00:47:47,941 --> 00:47:49,963
You can get in at a ridiculously early hour.

470
00:47:51,164 --> 00:47:54,767
It's not crowded, although I have not done it myself.

471
00:47:55,228 --> 00:48:02,674
But we need to really have a conversation about what we're charging to the public.

472
00:48:04,271 --> 00:48:06,313
to folks in the public who are using the pool.

473
00:48:06,353 --> 00:48:08,595
And it sounds like you'll get that done.

474
00:48:11,338 --> 00:48:12,299
Can you repeat?

475
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:14,961
I'm the chair of the board of SHORE.

476
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:18,505
So can you repeat what you said about the SHORE tuition?

477
00:48:18,545 --> 00:48:19,425
Because I was confused.

478
00:48:20,186 --> 00:48:21,708
OK.

479
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:29,094
So back even when I was working in Chelsea,

480
00:48:29,915 --> 00:48:38,842
you know, remember paying tuition to Medfit because we had two or three students in the Curtis Tufts special needs program.

481
00:48:41,364 --> 00:48:46,388
So those tuition payments went into this revolving fund.

482
00:48:47,229 --> 00:48:52,093
And so over time, surplus funds were built up.

483
00:48:54,115 --> 00:48:54,275
So

484
00:48:55,365 --> 00:49:08,696
Because the revenue that we collected was in connection with our special needs program, any spending we would do would be connected to our special needs program.

485
00:49:08,856 --> 00:49:14,201
So you can collect the money, and you can kind of spend it on special needs as you see fit.

486
00:49:14,581 --> 00:49:17,764
I think last year, we might have charged a portion of a teacher

487
00:49:21,077 --> 00:49:22,417
But anyway, thank you.

488
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:24,098
Yeah, that's great.

489
00:49:24,138 --> 00:49:24,358
Thank you.

490
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,278
I appreciate that.

491
00:49:25,979 --> 00:49:28,659
And then Kids Corner.

492
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:36,282
I mean, I think we have people who work in Medford because we have Kids Corner and it's great, right?

493
00:49:37,022 --> 00:49:44,084
But clearly we are not charging, which I realize it's charging staff, but we are not charging enough money to cover that.

494
00:49:44,324 --> 00:49:46,865
And we need to just

495
00:49:47,782 --> 00:49:48,422
bite the bullet.

496
00:49:48,502 --> 00:50:14,493
I don't know, I don't believe the school committee ever votes on what the costs for Kids Corner are, which should be interesting whether we're supposed to or not, but I certainly for one hope that whatever it costs, no matter how big the increase, it just needs to be zeroed out to, you know, if the increase is to double what we charge people, then that's the increase, because we can't be doing

497
00:50:15,285 --> 00:50:24,488
you know, having other programs pay for a service that is frankly a service that people all over would die to have.

498
00:50:25,388 --> 00:50:26,009
Right.

499
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:28,249
So, yeah, well, they did.

500
00:50:28,689 --> 00:50:30,890
This top line is the beginning balance.

501
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:34,051
So that means it was the ending balance in FY22.

502
00:50:34,351 --> 00:50:38,633
So they did finish the year in a surplus.

503
00:50:39,033 --> 00:50:43,534
So I'm confident that they will finish this year in a surplus.

504
00:50:43,594 --> 00:50:44,535
I just think that

505
00:50:46,093 --> 00:50:58,938
the revenues are lagging again, but it's still a concern until we close the books and we verify that it is in surplus.

506
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:00,559
That's great.

507
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:09,743
That makes me feel better because nobody wants to be telling folks, by the way, your daycare is going to now cost a lot more money because that would be terrible.

508
00:51:09,823 --> 00:51:13,204
But if this is lagging, that makes me much happier.

509
00:51:13,485 --> 00:51:14,285
Those are all my questions.

510
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:14,565
Thank you.

511
00:51:18,048 --> 00:51:18,408
Thank you.

512
00:51:19,108 --> 00:51:20,469
Next up is member Graham.

513
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:24,111
Thank you.

514
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:33,215
I think across the board, we have unequivocally been told in the past that it is absolutely the school committee's authority to set rates for all of these things.

515
00:51:34,135 --> 00:51:42,779
And we have never been presented with a rate card despite asking about it at least annually since I have been on the committee.

516
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,460
And so before we

517
00:51:45,300 --> 00:52:01,305
go too far into the next fiscal year, I would like to see a rate card for our review and approval for all the tuition-bearing parts of this revolving fund, and that would include recommendations about Kids' Corner, the pool,

518
00:52:03,126 --> 00:52:12,372
any sort of preschool programming, NEAP to the extent that community members are paying for it, driver's ed, athletics, like all of those things.

519
00:52:12,432 --> 00:52:20,898
I think we have approved athletics once or twice and really to waive tuition or waive user fees during COVID.

520
00:52:21,899 --> 00:52:27,122
But I would like to see a cohesive rate card that also includes our rentals.

521
00:52:28,784 --> 00:52:40,396
Our rental rates so that we as a committee can take a vote and be supportive of what we need to generate from a revenue perspective into these accounts.

522
00:52:41,317 --> 00:52:43,659
And I think, you know, Jerry.

523
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:48,636
Obviously, you can't do what you weren't even here to do.

524
00:52:48,716 --> 00:52:51,676
But we've asked this question multiple times.

525
00:52:52,516 --> 00:52:55,277
And we have been assured that it's coming.

526
00:52:55,397 --> 00:53:05,279
But I think we really do need a fiscal view of these tuitions to say, what do we recommend that they are for FY25?

527
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:08,059
We've already done that with before and after school.

528
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,200
So I feel comfortable with that.

529
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:15,203
They're not an exception in any way in terms of how they operate to anything else.

530
00:53:15,303 --> 00:53:26,350
So I'm hoping that that can be on the agenda in the coming month or so, because some of these programs, people will need to start to plan accordingly.

531
00:53:26,991 --> 00:53:27,191
Yep.

532
00:53:28,152 --> 00:53:31,114
Yep, that makes complete sense.

533
00:53:31,414 --> 00:53:32,775
And then I think the other thing.

534
00:53:33,976 --> 00:53:35,096
Member Graham, I was just going to ask,

535
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:46,388
Small presentations on each category, so we could vote on them individually as they're as they come ready.

536
00:53:46,529 --> 00:53:48,831
Or do you want a full overview?

537
00:53:49,692 --> 00:53:53,758
And when when everything's complete, just because maybe that would take longer than if.

538
00:53:54,979 --> 00:54:02,504
The pool could give us recommendations next month along with X, Y, and Z where others may take some time.

539
00:54:02,524 --> 00:54:04,865
I don't have a preference.

540
00:54:05,506 --> 00:54:10,930
Whatever is easiest for the administration to go through and cover all the bases.

541
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:17,874
I think whatever we do to set rates for next year, this year is going to be probably really imperfect.

542
00:54:18,515 --> 00:54:21,217
Next year, we can be a little bit more comprehensive about it.

543
00:54:22,297 --> 00:54:25,458
and say, is what we did last year, did it work, did it not work, et cetera.

544
00:54:26,978 --> 00:54:33,059
And then I think we can get on a schedule where we could do rate setting as a single thing.

545
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:36,860
But if it takes a while for us to get there, I think that's OK.

546
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,561
So I don't have a strong preference.

547
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:47,302
I think it's really more a question of how can the administration be ready for that.

548
00:54:47,722 --> 00:54:49,403
I had two other questions.

549
00:54:52,523 --> 00:55:02,837
One is I would like to see a reconciliation of athletic fees to ensure that we are collecting all of our athletic user fees.

550
00:55:02,957 --> 00:55:06,982
So I would like to know how many students are registered.

551
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:21,495
What that means in terms of the anticipated fees, the number of students who are exempted from fees, whether they have like multiple siblings in sports or they play many sports or we are providing financial assistance.

552
00:55:21,555 --> 00:55:23,417
I would just like to see an actual accounting of like

553
00:55:24,716 --> 00:55:35,281
Kids doing sports and money collected and I would like to see you know whether that number ties out or whether we have a problem collecting our fees.

554
00:55:36,101 --> 00:55:37,202
I am concerned that we do.

555
00:55:37,322 --> 00:55:39,323
I've heard from lots of people in the community that

556
00:55:40,263 --> 00:55:46,904
It's really hard to actually pay the school to have their kid participate, but their kids get to participate anyway, which is great.

557
00:55:47,545 --> 00:55:51,365
I would absolutely love for us to be a fee-free school.

558
00:55:51,706 --> 00:55:56,767
But in the meantime, if we're going to charge fees, I want to make sure we're doing it with accuracy and fairly.

559
00:55:56,787 --> 00:56:02,268
I've not ever been able to see any reporting that gives me that assurances.

560
00:56:03,308 --> 00:56:05,549
I think that would be another thing I'm interested in.

561
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:22,194
And then I think the other thing that strikes me, and it's honestly been on my mind since long before I was on the school committee, is when we talk about, and these are small examples, but lost Chromebooks and lost library books.

562
00:56:23,154 --> 00:56:24,894
What is the process for replacing those?

563
00:56:24,954 --> 00:56:29,436
Because I spent a lot of time in the school libraries, and what I heard was like,

564
00:56:30,736 --> 00:56:35,377
Oh, well, I keep this money in my petty cash because once it goes into the lost book fee, I can never get it.

565
00:56:35,557 --> 00:56:44,680
And what I see when I see a line that says there's $30,000 in lost Chromebooks, that's $30,000 in like Chromebooks not available to students.

566
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,660
And same thing with library books, right?

567
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:57,343
Like there's a 20 something thousand dollar balance, which in the library, the used library, the lost library book fund, that means there's $28,000 worth of books not available to our students.

568
00:56:58,003 --> 00:57:03,146
And I think the point of the fund is to replace the lost books, and it just doesn't seem like that happens.

569
00:57:03,646 --> 00:57:17,814
So I would also like to delve into what are the processes to use those funds, and who is responsible for making sure that's happening on a regular basis in those two particular instances.

570
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:24,177
So my plan, I just about finalized a scope of work

571
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:32,862
for to have an auditing firm come in and do a management review of our collection practices.

572
00:57:34,622 --> 00:57:44,185
So part of it was like organizing all these accounts where we collect revenue because there's just a number of different ways we collect revenue.

573
00:57:44,265 --> 00:57:53,148
And some departments are responsible for making deposits to the city treasurer's office.

574
00:57:53,609 --> 00:57:54,409
It's a little bit.

575
00:57:55,643 --> 00:57:59,564
kind of spread out from an accountability point of view.

576
00:57:59,584 --> 00:58:06,767
So just to get an idea, we have different websites where we make collections.

577
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:11,649
Other parents are able to pay in cash sometimes.

578
00:58:11,729 --> 00:58:20,412
And I don't have any, I'm not concerned that there's like fraud going on, but I think that we need

579
00:58:22,362 --> 00:58:29,946
Somebody come in, take a look at how we do it, give us recommendations on how we can tighten up the revenue collection.

580
00:58:30,226 --> 00:58:44,214
And then we're thinking about, you know, kind of in, you know, what is our, we need some capacity to manage the revenue better than we have now.

581
00:58:44,314 --> 00:58:49,397
So trying to, you know, envision like,

582
00:58:49,932 --> 00:58:59,377
making that somebody's position without necessarily adding another position, but maybe that's a recommendation from this report.

583
00:58:59,477 --> 00:59:00,937
But I agree with you.

584
00:59:01,058 --> 00:59:08,061
There's a lot of cooks in the kitchen on revenue collection.

585
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,421
Yeah, I completely agree.

586
00:59:14,222 --> 00:59:27,013
Maybe three years ago now, we asked for that exact audit to be done, and we retained Andy Paquette to do it, and he did provide a public report

587
00:59:31,243 --> 00:59:41,771
To us, and it did not go into that level of detail, which was disappointing at the time and also sort of the middle of cobit and lots was going on.

588
00:59:42,692 --> 00:59:45,534
I don't know if privately there were.

589
00:59:47,328 --> 00:59:49,470
recommendations made about revenue collection.

590
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:57,918
But as I sat here looking at this, I certainly said some sort of centralization of revenue operations and controls has to happen.

591
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:02,343
All that cash management control strikes me as a risk.

592
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:08,929
And it's great to hear you say you're not overly concerned about any sort of actual fraud happening right now.

593
01:00:09,049 --> 01:00:09,309
But

594
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:11,631
It's incumbent on us to prevent that.

595
01:00:11,731 --> 01:00:13,691
And I think we need to have good measures to do it.

596
01:00:14,512 --> 01:00:20,514
But also, we need to be able to tell people what they owe us and make it easy for people to pay.

597
01:00:20,614 --> 01:00:23,595
So I see stuff all the time.

598
01:00:23,755 --> 01:00:28,937
And field trips, people say, send cash or please send cash.

599
01:00:28,997 --> 01:00:32,018
And that's part of revenue collection.

600
01:00:32,978 --> 01:00:36,581
That's a symptom of complicated revenue collection, in my opinion.

601
01:00:36,661 --> 01:00:38,862
So I think we do need to do that.

602
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:43,385
But there may be some findings from that initial report that you can get your hands on as well.

603
01:00:43,966 --> 01:00:53,492
Yeah, there's a whole accounting system around student activities, which is where those funds would go, your last example.

604
01:00:53,552 --> 01:00:55,073
So that's not even on this chart.

605
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:59,696
But that would be part of the management review.

606
01:01:00,617 --> 01:01:01,778
Yeah, OK, great.

607
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:18,115
And then I think the other question I had is whether we're confident that community schools is being charged appropriately for the staff expenses.

608
01:01:18,715 --> 01:01:22,576
Yeah, we're not confident in that.

609
01:01:22,776 --> 01:01:28,098
I think that, and part of it was because, you know, some of our,

610
01:01:30,494 --> 01:01:34,357
our costs are not keeping up with the contracts that are being settled.

611
01:01:34,437 --> 01:01:51,712
So it's really, I'm glad to hear we get into a process of annual review of the rates, because I think that's gonna create a system where we're looking at the sufficiency of the rates we're charging on an annual basis.

612
01:01:51,772 --> 01:01:55,074
But we're probably, we are not,

613
01:01:57,073 --> 01:02:02,554
recovering the costs of staff that are assigned on the weekends to some of these events.

614
01:02:03,494 --> 01:02:04,334
Yeah.

615
01:02:04,794 --> 01:02:06,995
And that just can't continue to happen.

616
01:02:07,035 --> 01:02:12,356
We can't continue to pay in excess of what our rentals are providing us.

617
01:02:12,456 --> 01:02:16,336
It's just not feasible, and it hurts our students.

618
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:19,397
And we can't continue to do that.

619
01:02:19,937 --> 01:02:20,257
Agreed.

620
01:02:20,817 --> 01:02:20,997
Yeah.

621
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:23,458
Thank you so much, Jerry.

622
01:02:23,478 --> 01:02:24,378
This is super helpful.

623
01:02:26,912 --> 01:02:30,415
We can, I'm looking at the time, we can stop here.

624
01:02:30,435 --> 01:02:53,455
I had, you know, we do get private grants and donations as well, but, and I have a little presentation on kind of my thoughts around chargebacks to some of these programs to recover admin costs and facilities costs, but we can defer that to another time if you want.

625
01:02:55,509 --> 01:02:58,512
I know, I did see member, member Reinfeld, you put your hand down.

626
01:02:58,712 --> 01:02:59,973
I thought you had a question.

627
01:03:00,053 --> 01:03:01,914
It's up to the committee.

628
01:03:01,934 --> 01:03:04,116
I don't know who has time restrictions and I'm.

629
01:03:06,058 --> 01:03:06,778
I'm okay to stay.

630
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:08,700
Okay, I'm gonna just.

631
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,423
I think maybe 10 more minutes.

632
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:14,164
Sounds good.

633
01:03:14,865 --> 01:03:16,446
Okay.

634
01:03:17,087 --> 01:03:20,570
So we have these private grants that provide

635
01:03:25,313 --> 01:03:28,856
extra programming that doesn't affect the general fund.

636
01:03:29,917 --> 01:03:52,774
So the Center of Citizenship and Social Responsibility has three accounts that they manage, this Crystal Campbell Betterment Project, the Cummings Foundation, which is really a lot of how they provide for their programming.

637
01:03:54,122 --> 01:04:11,869
And then they also get donations here in column H. So they have programs running in every school, which is providing our students, you know, after school opportunity.

638
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:19,192
This Leah Clark English Award, to be honest, I'm not sure what this is for.

639
01:04:19,252 --> 01:04:20,693
I have to try to go back.

640
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:26,402
But it looks like it might be a scholarship type of a program.

641
01:04:27,963 --> 01:04:37,448
This Verizon grant is another private donation that we got, small balances.

642
01:04:38,588 --> 01:04:46,772
Some of these grants probably haven't been charged yet, or there might be small balances that will

643
01:04:48,932 --> 01:04:52,113
transfer out at the end of the year if they're no longer active.

644
01:04:52,133 --> 01:04:55,615
There's another group, Save Our Sports.

645
01:04:58,056 --> 01:04:59,376
So there's a small balance.

646
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:00,957
There's a gift.

647
01:05:01,277 --> 01:05:07,079
So these are little balances that will be transferred out.

648
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:12,842
The Campbell Gift Fund is also another CCSR.

649
01:05:16,725 --> 01:05:23,010
account, Bloomberg gift account, that looks like maybe it was something from the past with the balance on it.

650
01:05:23,691 --> 01:05:39,725
Then we have Medford Family Network has the children's, they get a grant from the Children's Trust, which I need to get a handle on because I want to say that there's probably

651
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,164
They have a few accounts.

652
01:05:42,244 --> 01:05:53,813
I want to say that this account's probably being overcharged in another account, like maybe this gift account is being undercharged, but we'll get to the bottom of that.

653
01:05:54,734 --> 01:05:58,837
And then there's this miscellaneous school gifts account.

654
01:05:58,877 --> 01:06:05,722
I'm not sure what's going in and out of this account, but typically a lot of schools have this type of account.

655
01:06:05,802 --> 01:06:08,905
Some people, sometimes alumni or

656
01:06:10,664 --> 01:06:21,131
successful families in Medford might just be generous and give a gift for no specific reason that it would go into this account.

657
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:26,474
And then there's something gonna notify the art department.

658
01:06:26,534 --> 01:06:32,757
There's money for a mural that seems to be available, Medford Family Network.

659
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:34,779
And then we got a grant for,

660
01:06:36,904 --> 01:06:50,752
STEM equipment and professional development, I think we got it in FY23, and we spent the money in FY23, so there was a deficit in the account, but then we received the funds in FY24, and that all balanced out.

661
01:06:50,832 --> 01:06:55,855
But it's just another group of funds that are outside.

662
01:06:56,515 --> 01:07:06,361
I know you know about Title I and ESSER and those types of grants, but there's these other smaller grants that the school department manages.

663
01:07:08,403 --> 01:07:10,445
I don't know if there's any questions on that.

664
01:07:12,246 --> 01:07:12,967
No, this is helpful.

665
01:07:13,027 --> 01:07:13,367
Thank you.

666
01:07:13,727 --> 01:07:14,067
OK.

667
01:07:14,628 --> 01:07:15,489
And then.

668
01:07:16,089 --> 01:07:17,650
Oh, sorry, sorry, I didn't see you.

669
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:18,311
Member Rousseau.

670
01:07:19,448 --> 01:07:46,385
I just have one question about, and I don't expect you to have the answer on this, but some of those things have substantial balances, and I'm hoping that somebody has the documentation on those bigger things, like there's three Cummings ones, because when I see these big numbers sitting there, I worry about the grant expiring, and then we have to send the money back because we didn't,

671
01:07:47,537 --> 01:07:53,300
figure out how to spend it, frankly, or did we spend it and we didn't properly account for the expenses.

672
01:07:53,780 --> 01:08:05,347
So, you know, obviously if you don't have the grant documents, you know, but that's something I hope we could do because there was some big numbers there.

673
01:08:05,727 --> 01:08:06,687
Yeah.

674
01:08:06,888 --> 01:08:14,952
The Crystal Campbell Betterment Project, which, you know, has the biggest balance, my understanding is that

675
01:08:16,766 --> 01:08:20,967
Most of that may be an endowment.

676
01:08:21,607 --> 01:08:26,808
I just have to work something out with the treasurer.

677
01:08:28,328 --> 01:08:44,071
An endowment is that we're going to keep the original contribution in perpetuity, and then we'd probably spend any interest that's being generated from that account.

678
01:08:46,102 --> 01:08:54,869
I think that's why you see the balance there, but we have to set up the accounting so we make sure that we don't spend the amount that's intended to be the endowment.

679
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:57,410
Thank you.

680
01:08:59,992 --> 01:09:00,373
Okay.

681
01:09:00,873 --> 01:09:09,139
I'm going to spend just a couple minutes and get your thoughts on this.

682
01:09:10,039 --> 01:09:10,200
Mayor?

683
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:14,703
I believe Member Antapa had a question.

684
01:09:15,394 --> 01:09:17,355
Oh, member Ntapa.

685
01:09:18,255 --> 01:09:32,062
No, I was just gonna, to a member, thank you, to member Rousseau's point of the Cummings Foundation, that large grant funds the CCSR over an expanded amount of time, so that might be why.

686
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:38,426
And I don't know if they have to give it back, but I do know they have to apply, I think, every 10 years or so.

687
01:09:38,446 --> 01:09:40,587
It's like somewhere between six to 10.

688
01:09:41,907 --> 01:09:43,028
But I was curious about the

689
01:09:44,078 --> 01:10:07,716
and if that had any in time in with the alumni association and where those funds are handled, where the overflow of SGA funds from the previous classes, I know some of them, sometimes they're retained, sometimes the SGA funds go into like the alumni association so that way they can do their own private scholarships.

690
01:10:07,756 --> 01:10:12,299
So I'm curious to see how much of that may be attributing to that, if at all.

691
01:10:13,798 --> 01:10:19,503
Or if it's purely outside, if it's purely outside donations of people who want to give back to our schools.

692
01:10:25,029 --> 01:10:26,150
Is that a question?

693
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:28,492
I had a little trouble hearing that.

694
01:10:29,833 --> 01:10:30,754
I know, my apologies.

695
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:36,800
I'm trying to figure out my mic, but I would be interested to see where the MHS gift

696
01:10:37,557 --> 01:10:46,306
Fund what what is funding that if it's anything with the alumni association, if it's in terms of overflow of funds, the student government.

697
01:10:46,987 --> 01:10:58,459
Funds were fundraised funds and then the beginning point again, I don't know how much was heard fixing my Mike situation for next meeting about the Cummings foundation being a grant that spent over a few years.

698
01:10:58,479 --> 01:10:59,580
And I think we're actually.

699
01:11:00,639 --> 01:11:02,420
in year one or year two of it.

700
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:14,967
I think it was just replenished, which might be why that number is so large, but that is the predominant funding source for all of the units of CCSR and all the projects.

701
01:11:15,287 --> 01:11:15,507
So.

702
01:11:16,488 --> 01:11:19,329
I do know they get an award for a number of years.

703
01:11:19,409 --> 01:11:23,132
So they get $35,000 a year from that award.

704
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:27,774
So I think it might've been, maybe it was a 10 year award of 350,000.

705
01:11:30,879 --> 01:11:31,599
I'm not sure.

706
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:37,902
I think the committee is going to get a presentation on that program soon.

707
01:11:39,422 --> 01:11:49,566
But if you could send me an email on your question, and I'll do the research for you.

708
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:53,387
gmccube at medfitk12.

709
01:11:53,407 --> 01:11:53,587
Okay.

710
01:12:02,613 --> 01:12:11,647
Okay, is this so well, no, it's Sorry

711
01:12:24,712 --> 01:12:32,434
So this was kind of my thinking around this chargeback plan that would need a little more work to go.

712
01:12:32,534 --> 01:12:45,457
But essentially, we have programs like the After School Program and Kids Corner and MEEP that use our facilities, use our administrative services.

713
01:12:47,858 --> 01:13:05,011
And, you know, we should be, we can charge those programs for the facilities expenses and the admin expenses for the services we're providing them.

714
01:13:05,091 --> 01:13:14,978
So the trick is kind of coming up with a methodology that's like fairly allocates expenses to those programs.

715
01:13:15,812 --> 01:13:23,180
So for the facilities charge, I thought the easiest way to do it would be to base it on classroom use.

716
01:13:25,843 --> 01:13:37,175
And then we might be able to kind of piggyback on this to figure out if we're charging these outside groups a sufficient amount for our facilities.

717
01:13:38,348 --> 01:13:46,775
But these are the number of classrooms we have according to the MSBA in each of our schools, 651 total.

718
01:13:48,496 --> 01:13:52,760
And then facilities budget for this year is 6.1 million.

719
01:13:52,780 --> 01:14:00,005
And if I divide the number of classrooms by the facilities budget, it's $9,400 per classroom.

720
01:14:03,367 --> 01:14:19,521
Then I said, well, we go at least 183 school days, including teacher days, and then maybe another 40 of July and August for a 223-day year, and we can nail that number down.

721
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:20,722
But that would be $42 a day.

722
01:14:20,742 --> 01:14:21,462
Then I divided.

723
01:14:28,482 --> 01:14:40,994
I assumed a 12-hour day and divided it into three time categories because, for instance, the after-school program mostly uses it after school.

724
01:14:42,775 --> 01:14:48,421
And then I assumed 10 classrooms per school.

725
01:14:48,801 --> 01:14:50,423
I don't know whether that's low or high.

726
01:14:50,483 --> 01:14:51,844
We'll confirm that number.

727
01:14:53,208 --> 01:15:11,738
But 170 school days and 10 early release days where the after-school program provides more of a half-day program, that works out to be a charge of $100,000 that we could recover for facilities.

728
01:15:12,799 --> 01:15:15,300
And then similarly for admin,

729
01:15:16,851 --> 01:15:22,592
Right now, we have 1,031 active employees.

730
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:29,454
We have a finance, HR, and technology budget of almost $1.1 million.

731
01:15:29,514 --> 01:15:39,976
So the finance, HR, and technology costs work out to be about $1,000 per employee.

732
01:15:40,316 --> 01:15:45,737
And then I'm assuming before and after school program has 60 employees.

733
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,001
And that will be a cost recovery of $63,000.

734
01:15:50,121 --> 01:16:06,797
So it will look like something like this, and this will be able to kind of offset some of the budgeted amounts in the general fund.

735
01:16:11,161 --> 01:16:11,341
Fair.

736
01:16:14,839 --> 01:16:17,521
More to come to that when we do the budget presentation.

737
01:16:19,763 --> 01:16:20,563
That's what we look at.

738
01:16:20,643 --> 01:16:31,272
And then the other thing is that I don't have for you tonight, but we do get E-rate funding for our technology projects, any project that qualifies for E-rate.

739
01:16:31,812 --> 01:16:36,856
So that will be part of an additional revenue presentation.

740
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:48,413
It's probably around $100,000 or $130,000 in offset for some of our technology costs.

741
01:16:55,756 --> 01:16:55,956
Mayor?

742
01:16:57,097 --> 01:16:59,378
And that's my presentation for tonight.

743
01:16:59,398 --> 01:17:04,540
Is this the mayor?

744
01:17:08,662 --> 01:17:09,502
Nope, she's still here.

745
01:17:12,198 --> 01:17:14,239
But member Rousseau, did you want to ask a question?

746
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:16,780
I did, yes.

747
01:17:17,921 --> 01:17:25,604
Not to throw a wrench, based on what I'm seeing, it's more like throwing a little tiny file into this networks.

748
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:38,509
But when we talk about the after school program, for instance, you know, we just became aware that a primary space they use at one of the schools was just reserved for another program without their

749
01:17:40,595 --> 01:17:43,218
They were just told, by the way, you don't have your space anymore.

750
01:17:43,298 --> 01:17:47,403
So, when I think about making the paper spaces, I think we have to.

751
01:17:49,386 --> 01:17:52,329
Also, come think about how their space.

752
01:17:53,491 --> 01:17:58,336
Literally, because we still can't figure out how to do reservations and space in the district.

753
01:18:01,945 --> 01:18:05,947
that their space may, in fact, just randomly no longer be theirs.

754
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:13,812
So when we talk about charging them, I almost feel like we should pay them back for the crisis that we put them in when we give away their space.

755
01:18:15,372 --> 01:18:20,375
And I realize that's sort of an additional little piece of work, what to do in those situations.

756
01:18:20,475 --> 01:18:28,580
But I just think it's super unfair and a minor thing to think about after the fact.

757
01:18:29,755 --> 01:18:31,076
Yeah, no, I agree.

758
01:18:31,136 --> 01:18:35,358
And it just it happens in every school district.

759
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:37,359
But you have to.

760
01:18:41,041 --> 01:18:50,427
The the the services that are being provided by the after school program are just as important as whatever else is happening in the school.

761
01:18:50,547 --> 01:18:55,670
And the best way to do it is just before school come to an agreement with the principal.

762
01:18:56,130 --> 01:18:57,851
What spaces are going to be available?

763
01:18:58,392 --> 01:19:01,653
on a regular basis for the afterschool program.

764
01:19:02,213 --> 01:19:15,395
And then things come up and people work together and they kind of work things out for something unforeseen, but you have to have a regularly available space to do proper planning.

765
01:19:16,355 --> 01:19:25,537
And then there's other spaces within the school that can be used for some of these other meetings or kind of

766
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:33,111
figure out a way, you know, how best to share the space, but it's not an untypical problem in districts.

767
01:19:38,032 --> 01:19:39,773
Great, thank you so much, Jerry.

768
01:19:40,253 --> 01:19:42,454
If there's any other further questions?

769
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:47,055
Motion to adjourn.

770
01:19:48,055 --> 01:19:53,977
Motion to adjourn by Member Graham, seconded by... Second.

771
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:58,412
I think that was member Brantley, or member Reinfeldt.

772
01:19:59,933 --> 01:20:01,874
Reinfeldt, roll call please.

773
01:20:07,937 --> 01:20:11,399
Thank you, I'm talking to myself saying, I'm muted aren't I, as if anybody's going to answer.

774
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,060
Member Brantley.

775
01:20:14,061 --> 01:20:14,301
Yes.

776
01:20:15,322 --> 01:20:15,782
Member Grant.

777
01:20:16,302 --> 01:20:16,562
Yes.

778
01:20:17,463 --> 01:20:18,163
Member Doppel.

779
01:20:18,824 --> 01:20:19,084
Yes.

780
01:20:19,925 --> 01:20:20,685
