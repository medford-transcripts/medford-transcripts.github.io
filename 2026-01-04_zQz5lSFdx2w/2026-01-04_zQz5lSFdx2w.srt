1
00:00:01,275 --> 00:00:05,817
[SPEAKER_05]: and through the wood to Grandmother's house we go.

2
00:00:06,657 --> 00:00:12,340
[SPEAKER_05]: The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh through the white and drifted snow.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,623
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the river and through the wood, oh, how the wind does blow.

4
00:00:19,563 --> 00:00:23,625
[SPEAKER_05]: It stings the toes and bites the nose as over the grass

5
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:29,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to Looking Back at Metro History.

6
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Laura Duggan, your hostess.

7
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,461
[SPEAKER_09]: This is our Christmas special 2025.

8
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:45,869
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, we always like to go to the North Pole this time of year and interview the folks up there who are busily getting ready for Christmas.

9
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:59,922
[SPEAKER_09]: I recently got a text from Mrs. Claus saying that Santa's two brothers, do you remember them, Elvis Claus and Brady Claus, will be coming back again to visit Big Brother Santa.

10
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:09,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Frequent viewers of this show have probably recalled that last year the Claus brothers had a big reunion.

11
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:17,435
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you didn't see it, you can still see it by going to metfordtv.org and then watch it there.

12
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:24,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, Ade, are you ready to go to the North Pole with me and do the filming?

13
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:24,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good.

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get my my coat on.

16
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,243
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty cold up there, as you do.

17
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:32,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

18
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Like your coat.

19
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:34,285
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

20
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:35,166
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a nice one.

21
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:36,967
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you ready?

22
00:01:38,187 --> 00:01:38,347
[SPEAKER_09]: See?

23
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:41,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Almost ready, gonna zip up here.

24
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:43,154
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotta make sure my collar's right.

25
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:46,635
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanna look good.

26
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:48,356
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, there we go.

27
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:50,056
[SPEAKER_09]: All righty.

28
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:54,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, let me bring up the World Travel app.

29
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:55,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

30
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:56,638
[SPEAKER_09]: N-O-R-A-V-E.

31
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:12,600
[SPEAKER_09]: T-H, space, P-O-L-E.

32
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:15,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Ready, Day?

33
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

34
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:44,137
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here.

35
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:50,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Santa's house is just over the ridge over there.

36
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

37
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:52,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

38
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:53,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get going.

39
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:58,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little further.

40
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:07,792
[SPEAKER_08]: We're almost there.

41
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:09,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope.

42
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:11,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Just over the ridge.

43
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:11,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I know where it is.

44
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:18,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Still there?

45
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:27,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have worn my snowboots.

46
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:32,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost there maybe?

47
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,626
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.

48
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, here we are.

49
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:42,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do you ring the doorbell?

50
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:54,799
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hello, Laura and Jay.

51
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,420
[SPEAKER_09]: So nice to see you again.

52
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello again.

53
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:02,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Has Santa's brothers arrived yet?

54
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,244
[SPEAKER_09]: No, not yet.

55
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:09,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you, Laura and Jay, would you like some hot chocolate?

56
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:11,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I sure would.

57
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:11,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

58
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:16,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here are some snickerdoodle cookies for you and Santa.

59
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:23,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

60
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:28,005
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how Santa just loves these cookies.

61
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:31,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get you some hot chocolate.

62
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:33,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be right back.

63
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:37,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Dave, are you getting all of this?

64
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:42,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Ho, ho, ho.

65
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:44,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, hello, Laura.

66
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:45,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Dave.

67
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:47,693
[SPEAKER_03]: So good to see you again.

68
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:49,948
[SPEAKER_09]: You too, Santa.

69
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:53,290
[SPEAKER_09]: I brought day as well as my wish list.

70
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't want it to get lost in the mail.

71
00:04:56,391 --> 00:05:02,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's shorter than last year.

72
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you been a good girl this year, Laura?

73
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:08,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always good.

74
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:16,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Here I come with a hot chocolate.

75
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:19,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, let me take a look at that.

76
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Santa, I would like, yes, one of those, too.

77
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I have that, too?

78
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Christmas is coming.

79
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:28,072
[SPEAKER_09]: You know I'm always good and jolly with you.

80
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:29,073
[SPEAKER_09]: We're jolly.

81
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:29,513
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

82
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:31,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes.

83
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:32,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

84
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of those, too.

85
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:34,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, one of those.

86
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:35,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, dear.

87
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:37,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's your hot chocolate.

88
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:39,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good day.

89
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:41,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

90
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:43,058
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and here's the other one.

91
00:05:44,398 --> 00:05:45,259
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

92
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:54,606
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

93
00:05:56,547 --> 00:05:57,688
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go put this away.

94
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:04,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a list.

95
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:09,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Santa, I can't wait to see your brothers again.

96
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:11,479
[SPEAKER_09]: What are they expected?

97
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:13,821
[SPEAKER_09]: They should be here any minute.

98
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:16,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Ooh, that must be them.

99
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Get ready, Day.

100
00:06:26,947 --> 00:06:28,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's how you do it.

101
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,469
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you do it.

102
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:31,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you guys.

103
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, catch that ball.

104
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:33,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Two hands.

105
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:34,946
[SPEAKER_03]: So glad you could come back here.

106
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:36,947
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all had our last Christmas.

107
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:37,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right.

108
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:39,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see you.

109
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:41,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you, too.

110
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:43,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Hug.

111
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:44,933
[SPEAKER_03]: The Claus Brothers.

112
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Day, are you getting all of this?

113
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

114
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:52,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

115
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:55,740
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad you came, but man, this is my busiest time of the year.

116
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,232
[SPEAKER_03]: You picked a great time, but I'm busy.

117
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,733
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll spend time with you guys.

118
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're busy too.

119
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,094
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all over the place.

120
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:03,974
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

121
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:06,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I tour all over the world.

122
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:09,458
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm telling you, I got to play gig after gig.

123
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,680
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just got this one gig, one night of the year.

124
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,021
[SPEAKER_04]: And what about you in the playoffs?

125
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:16,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got the bills coming up.

126
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:17,803
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to kick their butts.

127
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:19,704
[SPEAKER_03]: But I appreciate it.

128
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:20,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm here for you guys.

129
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:24,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, you guys couldn't do what I do.

130
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, one year and one night.

131
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:28,611
[SPEAKER_03]: In preparation, I'll tell you this.

132
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:31,996
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys try and do my job for one week.

133
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:35,049
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'll give you the easiest part of my job.

134
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,770
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

135
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:40,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe wrap some presents, you know, get the sleigh ready.

136
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:42,134
[SPEAKER_03]: One week.

137
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:43,675
[SPEAKER_04]: One week.

138
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Our revolution has an entire genre of music.

139
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I can drop off a couple packages.

140
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, Mrs. Claus and I haven't had a vacation in 400 years.

141
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,665
[SPEAKER_03]: We could certainly use a nice little trip somewhere.

142
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:58,766
[SPEAKER_03]: How about it?

143
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:00,186
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys take over one week.

144
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,067
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do it.

145
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:01,667
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do it.

146
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:02,428
[SPEAKER_04]: How about this?

147
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:13,415
[SPEAKER_04]: We mine the store up here in the chilly North Pole, and you head down to where I filmed one of my movies, The Beautiful Island Nation of Hawaii.

148
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:14,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Mrs. Claus?

149
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:17,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Aloha, aloha.

150
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:18,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Pack your bags.

151
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:19,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the manual.

152
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,642
[SPEAKER_09]: The boys need this manual.

153
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:27,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Read this thoroughly before you do any of your chores.

154
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:28,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

155
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:29,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

156
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:31,050
[SPEAKER_03]: He's all in the manual.

157
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a problem.

158
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:34,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Piece of cake.

159
00:08:34,393 --> 00:08:35,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your bags back.

160
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:37,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I just packed a few things.

161
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:37,796
[SPEAKER_03]: A few?

162
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:38,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, darling.

163
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:40,979
[SPEAKER_09]: You got your rock collection in here?

164
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:41,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Go on, I know.

165
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,881
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going this way.

166
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:43,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Hawaii's that way.

167
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:44,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, guys.

168
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:45,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Aloha.

169
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:46,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

170
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:48,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, brother and sister-in-law.

171
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:49,895
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

172
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:50,936
[SPEAKER_04]: How about a song?

173
00:08:51,177 --> 00:08:52,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we could do a song.

174
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:53,519
[SPEAKER_04]: How about this one?

175
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:57,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Love me tender, love me true.

176
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:02,506
[SPEAKER_04]: I will save Christmas with you.

177
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,208
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how you just make stuff up.

178
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:04,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.

179
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:06,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

180
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:14,757
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe, maybe we should focus up and huddle up on what our first course of action would be, brother.

181
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:23,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all we got to do is we got to get that reindeer and the sleigh and do the magic to get them flying all over the world.

182
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:23,919
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that.

183
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:24,820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a big deal.

184
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,821
[SPEAKER_04]: We just came in from the chilly cold.

185
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:32,125
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we start with something a little warmer, like wrapping those beautiful presents.

186
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:33,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I can do that blindfolded.

187
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:34,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a big deal.

188
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,007
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

189
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Claus Brothers, high five.

190
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:37,629
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

191
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:39,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Be naughty or be nice.

192
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:39,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Be on this list.

193
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:43,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to Christmas wrapping.

194
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:44,434
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it, bro.

195
00:09:45,214 --> 00:09:45,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

196
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:47,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

197
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:50,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to wrap some presents.

198
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:52,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know what to do.

199
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,843
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're so lost, I think we need more glue.

200
00:09:56,863 --> 00:10:00,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey bro, you know how to do a ribbon?

201
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:02,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Tie a bow?

202
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:03,127
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you do this?

203
00:10:03,908 --> 00:10:09,032
[SPEAKER_04]: I always had my stage hands help me with the ribbons and all my festoonments.

204
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:10,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen.

205
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:12,254
[SPEAKER_04]: We're caught in a trap.

206
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:16,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't gift wrap.

207
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:22,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I taped it too much, Brady.

208
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,872
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?

209
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:31,334
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not up to our standards.

210
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:32,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

211
00:10:34,396 --> 00:10:36,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think I have to call an audible then.

212
00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:40,300
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have to do this later or find someone to help us.

213
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what the manual says here.

214
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:49,824
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, we're really in charge of Santa's sleigh, that we really should line up Santa's sleigh.

215
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:54,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Step one, we need to line up the reindeer and then hook them up to each other.

216
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:55,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do that part of it.

217
00:10:55,348 --> 00:10:56,288
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that, can't we?

218
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:57,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so, brother.

219
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:57,949
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

220
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,270
[SPEAKER_04]: We can manage that.

221
00:10:59,290 --> 00:10:59,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do that.

222
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:07,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to have a bunch of gorgeous horses, and reindeer are just horses with a hood ornament on top.

223
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:10,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll round up those galloping beauties.

224
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:14,283
[SPEAKER_04]: and you get the sleigh ready to rock and roll!

225
00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:15,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock and roll baby!

226
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:24,638
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay big brother, I've got these reindeer all lined up.

227
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:30,270
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's look at the playbook here and see what the next thing is.

228
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:35,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Step three is crack the whip and we soar into the sky.

229
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:36,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

230
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:38,496
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go, brother.

231
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,357
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the whip.

232
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,138
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

233
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:41,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Red.

234
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Green.

235
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Forty-two.

236
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:44,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Set.

237
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:45,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Hike.

238
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:46,743
[SPEAKER_03]: On Dasher.

239
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:47,503
[SPEAKER_03]: On Dancer.

240
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,244
[SPEAKER_03]: On Prancer.

241
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:48,945
[SPEAKER_03]: On Vixen.

242
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:57,508
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not good.

243
00:11:57,768 --> 00:12:00,811
[SPEAKER_04]: What in the tinsel tossing tarnation was that?

244
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:05,014
[SPEAKER_04]: The reindeer just gave our sleigh the slip.

245
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:09,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Step one, we line up the reindeer.

246
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:11,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Checkerino.

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Step three, we crack the whip, right?

248
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:15,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Checkeroonie.

249
00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:17,424
[SPEAKER_03]: We forgot step two.

250
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:20,927
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't hook them up to the sleigh.

251
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, checka whoopsie.

252
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:29,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be cruel to me, brother, for totally fumbling the ball at the end zone there.

253
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:30,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

254
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:32,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the guy that screwed up there.

255
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:33,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I gronked it.

256
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:34,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

257
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:34,335
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

258
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:35,216
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta call.

259
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:36,177
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta call him.

260
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:40,640
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta give him a little jingle jangle on his Santa phone.

261
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:42,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, brother.

262
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:44,203
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in the soup now.

263
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:56,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, this Hawaii is great, isn't it, honey?

264
00:12:57,072 --> 00:12:58,333
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, it sure is.

265
00:12:58,353 --> 00:13:00,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm having such a good time.

266
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,855
[SPEAKER_03]: We should do this more often.

267
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:03,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

268
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God for my brothers, huh?

269
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:06,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.

270
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:08,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

271
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:12,239
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the phone.

272
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:12,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I better get it.

273
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:15,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

274
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:17,661
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, guys.

275
00:13:17,781 --> 00:13:18,201
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

276
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:22,263
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean, you lost the reindeer?

277
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,202
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're having trouble wrapping the gifts.

278
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:31,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the elves have a very high standard, you know.

279
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:34,607
[SPEAKER_03]: You want us to come back.

280
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:40,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me ask Mrs. Claus, because she's having a wonderful time.

281
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:42,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Honey, the boys want us to return.

282
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:43,884
[SPEAKER_03]: They're having problems.

283
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:46,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you tell those two brothers of yours.

284
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:47,405
[SPEAKER_09]: They're on their own.

285
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:50,347
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a week, and we're going to keep the week.

286
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:54,928
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, I have to work on my tan.

287
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:55,688
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that, dear.

288
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,209
[SPEAKER_09]: And later, I have to get my nails done.

289
00:13:58,589 --> 00:13:59,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Red, of course, of course.

290
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,451
[SPEAKER_09]: And oh my goodness, I have a lesson.

291
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,412
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a surfing lesson with the Duke.

292
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:06,933
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll see you later.

293
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:07,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

294
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,716
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you heard that, guys, but you're out of luck.

295
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:12,636
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta figure it out.

296
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:14,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you use the manual?

297
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:15,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I left you the manual.

298
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:16,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you use it?

299
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,440
[SPEAKER_03]: You did.

300
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,621
[SPEAKER_03]: But you left out a part or two.

301
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,465
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see you in another week.

302
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:27,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck.

303
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:30,007
[SPEAKER_03]: They thought my job was easy.

304
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:30,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Bartender.

305
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,512
[SPEAKER_09]: GJ, things look bad here up at the North Pole.

306
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:44,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think Christmas might get canceled?

307
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:47,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

308
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:51,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I can get help.

309
00:14:52,378 --> 00:14:54,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Fortunately, Christmas isn't here yet.

310
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,362
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can just hold things together till Santa gets back.

311
00:15:00,754 --> 00:15:04,736
[SPEAKER_09]: What if we beam up some more helpers from around the world?

312
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I have my special world travel app on my laptop.

313
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:13,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll beam up some Norwegians to round up the reindeer.

314
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:23,927
[SPEAKER_09]: And for wrapping the presents, how about some folks from Macy's gift wrap department?

315
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:24,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's give it a try.

316
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:35,119
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back!

317
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,101
[SPEAKER_08]: What a relief.

318
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:37,902
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

319
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:38,943
[SPEAKER_08]: One for you.

320
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:40,324
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

321
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:44,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't want to mess your hair.

322
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:47,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Aloha, aloha.

323
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,832
[SPEAKER_04]: We're so happy to see you, brother.

324
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:54,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I gotta admit, you guys really did a good job.

325
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:59,380
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had my doubts, and I must apologize.

326
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,017
[SPEAKER_03]: The elves loved you guys.

327
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:04,445
[SPEAKER_03]: You did a great job.

328
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:05,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Great job.

329
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:07,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Teamwork, that's what it's all about.

330
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:10,507
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's good to get home.

331
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:11,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes it is.

332
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,368
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to get home.

333
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:19,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I can speak for both of us in that we wouldn't have been able to do this if it wasn't for the help of Laura and Day.

334
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:24,074
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way from Medford Community Media.

335
00:16:24,114 --> 00:16:26,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you girls, thank you, thank you.

336
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:28,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, thank you very much.

337
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:30,857
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe next year too?

338
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:37,171
[SPEAKER_03]: let's do it all right all right but it's not that easy is it it's not that easy a job is it

339
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:38,794
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but we love it.

340
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:39,274
[SPEAKER_03]: We love it.

341
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:40,255
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to help the kids.

342
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:41,396
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to help the community.

343
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:44,118
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to help bring love and joy to the world.

344
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:49,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told Mrs. Claus I want a football for Christmas so I can practice for next year.

345
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,742
[SPEAKER_03]: No more fumbling.

346
00:16:50,782 --> 00:16:52,023
[SPEAKER_03]: No more fumbling.

347
00:16:52,203 --> 00:17:01,390
[SPEAKER_09]: It is so wonderful to see all the Claus brothers getting along so nicely, especially on Christmas.

348
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,894
[SPEAKER_04]: What better way to kick off this moment of brotherly harmony than with a little music?

349
00:17:07,274 --> 00:17:08,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah!

350
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,635
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a tune for us, bro?

351
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we sing Blue Christmas here?

352
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:12,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, one of my favorites.

353
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:13,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

354
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,400
[SPEAKER_04]: And a one, and a two, and a Christmas, here we go.

355
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:27,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have a blue Christmas without you.

356
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:35,750
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be so blue just thinking about you.

357
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:48,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Decorations were red on a green Christmas tree.

358
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:57,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Won't be the same, dear, if you're not here with me.

359
00:17:57,763 --> 00:18:05,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of those blue snowflakes are falling.

360
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:16,207
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when those blue memories start calling.

361
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:28,851
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white.

362
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:33,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll have a blue

363
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:46,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue, blue, blue Christmas for us!

364
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:47,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

365
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:48,529
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it!

366
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:49,269
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it!

367
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Merry Christmas!

368
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Day, it's time to get back to the station.

369
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:53,192
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go!

370
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:11,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that was great.

371
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:17,724
[SPEAKER_09]: It's always wonderful to see family members getting along, especially around Christmas.

372
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

373
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:20,386
[SPEAKER_09]: No, yup.

374
00:19:22,407 --> 00:19:23,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Day.

375
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:23,847
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

376
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:25,248
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for filming.

377
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:37,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's time to read one of my favorite books, The Night Before Christmas by Clement C. Moore.

378
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:40,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone get comfortable out there in TV land.

379
00:19:40,844 --> 00:19:57,450
[SPEAKER_09]: "'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.

380
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,185
[SPEAKER_09]: The stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that St.

381
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Nicholas soon would be there.

382
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:26,780
[SPEAKER_09]: The children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.

383
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:40,350
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

384
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:53,056
[SPEAKER_09]: When out of the lawn there rose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.

385
00:20:53,976 --> 00:21:00,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

386
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:21,184
[SPEAKER_09]: The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the luster of midday to objects below, when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and a tiny reindeer.

387
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:30,570
[SPEAKER_09]: When a little old driver so lively and quick

388
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:34,589
[SPEAKER_09]: I knew in a moment it must be Sank Nick.

389
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:44,614
[SPEAKER_09]: More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name.

390
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:59,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer and Bixen, on Comet, on Cupid, on Dancer and Blitzen, on top of the porch, on top of the wall, to the top of the wall, now dash away, dash away, dash away all.

391
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:10,450
[SPEAKER_09]: as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.

392
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:18,013
[SPEAKER_09]: So up to the housetop, the coursers, they flew with a sleigh full of toys and St.

393
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:18,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Nicholas too.

394
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:30,137
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof, the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.

395
00:22:37,671 --> 00:22:42,975
[SPEAKER_09]: As I drew in my head and was turning around, down the chimney, St.

396
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:45,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Nicholas came with a bound.

397
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:57,666
[SPEAKER_09]: He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.

398
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:05,472
[SPEAKER_09]: A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his path.

399
00:23:08,462 --> 00:23:11,223
[SPEAKER_09]: His eyes, how they twinkled!

400
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:13,923
[SPEAKER_09]: His dimples, how merry!

401
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:18,184
[SPEAKER_09]: His cheeps were like roses, his nose like a cherry.

402
00:23:19,444 --> 00:23:27,025
[SPEAKER_09]: His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.

403
00:23:27,045 --> 00:23:34,847
[SPEAKER_09]: The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke had encircled his head like a wreath.

404
00:23:35,985 --> 00:23:44,268
[SPEAKER_09]: He had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.

405
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:44,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Ho!

406
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:45,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Ho!

407
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:45,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Ho!

408
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:51,591
[SPEAKER_09]: He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf.

409
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:55,772
[SPEAKER_09]: And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself.

410
00:23:57,073 --> 00:24:03,475
[SPEAKER_09]: A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

411
00:24:05,347 --> 00:24:22,319
[SPEAKER_09]: He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk, and laying his finger aside of his nose, and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.

412
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:32,486
[SPEAKER_09]: He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, and away they all flew, like the down of a thistle.

413
00:24:33,843 --> 00:24:37,624
[SPEAKER_09]: But I heard him exclaim, ere he rode out of sight.

414
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:44,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night.

415
00:24:50,468 --> 00:24:52,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Did all of you enjoy that as much as I did?

416
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:55,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's time to say goodbye.

417
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:03,012
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Laura Duggan, your hostess, hoping to see you again on Looking Back at Medford History.

418
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:14,092
[SPEAKER_09]: and I and everyone here at Metro Community Media want to wish all a very merry Christmas and a happy new year.

419
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:32,578
[SPEAKER_04]: ♪ Oh well those blue snowflakes are falling ♪ ♪ That's when those blue memories start calling ♪

420
00:25:34,812 --> 00:25:45,818
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be doing all right with your Christmas up wide.

421
00:25:46,758 --> 00:26:02,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas.

422
00:26:04,092 --> 00:26:04,773
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it!

423
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Merry Christmas everybody!
