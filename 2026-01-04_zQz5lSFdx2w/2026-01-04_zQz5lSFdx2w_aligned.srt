1
00:00:01,275 --> 00:00:05,817
and through the wood to Grandmother's house we go.

2
00:00:06,657 --> 00:00:12,340
The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh through the white and drifted snow.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,623
Over the river and through the wood, oh, how the wind does blow.

4
00:00:19,563 --> 00:00:23,625
It stings the toes and bites the nose as over the grass

5
00:00:26,956 --> 00:00:29,077
Welcome to Looking Back at Metro History.

6
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,179
I'm Laura Duggan, your hostess.

7
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,461
This is our Christmas special 2025.

8
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:45,869
As you know, we always like to go to the North Pole this time of year and interview the folks up there who are busily getting ready for Christmas.

9
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:59,922
I recently got a text from Mrs. Claus saying that Santa's two brothers, do you remember them, Elvis Claus and Brady Claus, will be coming back again to visit Big Brother Santa.

10
00:01:01,063 --> 00:01:09,010
Frequent viewers of this show have probably recalled that last year the Claus brothers had a big reunion.

11
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:17,435
And if you didn't see it, you can still see it by going to metfordtv.org and then watch it there.

12
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:24,219
Anyway, Ade, are you ready to go to the North Pole with me and do the filming?

13
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:24,660
Yeah.

14
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,580
Oh, good.

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,501
Let me get my my coat on.

16
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:31,243
It's pretty cold up there, as you do.

17
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:32,504
Yeah.

18
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,885
Like your coat.

19
00:01:33,945 --> 00:01:34,285
Wow.

20
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:35,166
That's a nice one.

21
00:01:36,426 --> 00:01:36,967
Are you ready?

22
00:01:38,187 --> 00:01:38,347
See?

23
00:01:39,713 --> 00:01:41,434
Almost ready, gonna zip up here.

24
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:43,154
Gotta make sure my collar's right.

25
00:01:43,174 --> 00:01:46,635
I wanna look good.

26
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:48,356
All right, there we go.

27
00:01:48,376 --> 00:01:50,056
All righty.

28
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:54,457
Now, let me bring up the World Travel app.

29
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:55,958
Okay.

30
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:56,638
N-O-R-A-V-E.

31
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:12,600
T-H, space, P-O-L-E.

32
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:15,482
Ready, Day?

33
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,803
Yep.

34
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:44,137
We're here.

35
00:02:44,157 --> 00:02:50,221
I think Santa's house is just over the ridge over there.

36
00:02:50,701 --> 00:02:51,002
Okay.

37
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:52,402
Come on.

38
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:53,063
Let's get going.

39
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:58,866
Just a little further.

40
00:02:59,127 --> 00:03:07,792
We're almost there.

41
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:09,293
I hope.

42
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:11,214
Just over the ridge.

43
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:11,934
I know where it is.

44
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:18,763
Still there?

45
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:27,005
I should have worn my snowboots.

46
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:32,826
Almost there maybe?

47
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,626
I hope so.

48
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:37,227
Oh, here we are.

49
00:03:38,227 --> 00:03:42,028
Why do you ring the doorbell?

50
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:54,799
Oh, hello, Laura and Jay.

51
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,420
So nice to see you again.

52
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,161
Hello again.

53
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:02,163
Has Santa's brothers arrived yet?

54
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,244
No, not yet.

55
00:04:06,265 --> 00:04:09,566
Would you, Laura and Jay, would you like some hot chocolate?

56
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:11,027
I sure would.

57
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:11,107
Yep.

58
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:16,390
Well, here are some snickerdoodle cookies for you and Santa.

59
00:04:22,022 --> 00:04:23,523
Thank you so much.

60
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:28,005
You know how Santa just loves these cookies.

61
00:04:29,705 --> 00:04:31,566
Let me get you some hot chocolate.

62
00:04:32,827 --> 00:04:33,667
I'll be right back.

63
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:37,128
Dave, are you getting all of this?

64
00:04:37,148 --> 00:04:42,250
Ho, ho, ho.

65
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:44,051
Well, hello, Laura.

66
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:45,532
Hello, Dave.

67
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:47,693
So good to see you again.

68
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:49,948
You too, Santa.

69
00:04:49,968 --> 00:04:53,290
I brought day as well as my wish list.

70
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,371
I didn't want it to get lost in the mail.

71
00:04:56,391 --> 00:05:02,553
Oh, it's shorter than last year.

72
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,275
Have you been a good girl this year, Laura?

73
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:08,636
I'm always good.

74
00:05:14,967 --> 00:05:16,908
Here I come with a hot chocolate.

75
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:19,029
Oh, let me take a look at that.

76
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:22,950
Oh, Santa, I would like, yes, one of those, too.

77
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,971
Can I have that, too?

78
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,251
Christmas is coming.

79
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:28,072
You know I'm always good and jolly with you.

80
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:29,073
We're jolly.

81
00:05:29,153 --> 00:05:29,513
Yes.

82
00:05:30,153 --> 00:05:31,774
Oh, yes.

83
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:32,214
Yes.

84
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,254
And one of those, too.

85
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:34,455
Yes, one of those.

86
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:35,595
Oh, dear.

87
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:37,556
Here's your hot chocolate.

88
00:05:39,276 --> 00:05:39,877
Have a good day.

89
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:41,857
Thank you.

90
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:43,058
Oh, and here's the other one.

91
00:05:44,398 --> 00:05:45,259
Okay.

92
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:54,606
All right.

93
00:05:56,547 --> 00:05:57,688
We'll go put this away.

94
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:04,013
Such a list.

95
00:06:07,336 --> 00:06:09,898
Santa, I can't wait to see your brothers again.

96
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:11,479
What are they expected?

97
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:13,821
They should be here any minute.

98
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:16,999
Ooh, that must be them.

99
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,280
Get ready, Day.

100
00:06:26,947 --> 00:06:28,369
Yeah, that's how you do it.

101
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,469
That's how you do it.

102
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:31,664
Good to see you guys.

103
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,085
Absolutely, catch that ball.

104
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:33,585
Two hands.

105
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:34,946
So glad you could come back here.

106
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:36,947
We've all had our last Christmas.

107
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:37,968
Oh, right.

108
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:39,189
Nice to see you.

109
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:41,090
Good to see you, too.

110
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:43,252
Hug.

111
00:06:43,892 --> 00:06:44,933
The Claus Brothers.

112
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,494
Day, are you getting all of this?

113
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:49,396
Yep.

114
00:06:50,937 --> 00:06:52,278
Oh, yeah.

115
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:55,740
I'm glad you came, but man, this is my busiest time of the year.

116
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:59,232
You picked a great time, but I'm busy.

117
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:00,733
But I'll spend time with you guys.

118
00:07:01,253 --> 00:07:02,133
Well, you're busy too.

119
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,094
You're all over the place.

120
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:03,974
That's right.

121
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:06,196
I tour all over the world.

122
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:09,458
And I'm telling you, I got to play gig after gig.

123
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:12,680
And you just got this one gig, one night of the year.

124
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,021
And what about you in the playoffs?

125
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:16,542
Yeah, we got the bills coming up.

126
00:07:16,582 --> 00:07:17,803
We got to kick their butts.

127
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:19,704
But I appreciate it.

128
00:07:19,764 --> 00:07:20,805
And I'm here for you guys.

129
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:24,267
Listen, you guys couldn't do what I do.

130
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,008
I'm telling you, one year and one night.

131
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:28,611
In preparation, I'll tell you this.

132
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:31,996
You guys try and do my job for one week.

133
00:07:32,928 --> 00:07:35,049
and I'll give you the easiest part of my job.

134
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:35,770
What's that?

135
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:40,153
Maybe wrap some presents, you know, get the sleigh ready.

136
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:42,134
One week.

137
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:43,675
One week.

138
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,018
Our revolution has an entire genre of music.

139
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:50,120
I think I can drop off a couple packages.

140
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,783
Well, you know, Mrs. Claus and I haven't had a vacation in 400 years.

141
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:57,665
We could certainly use a nice little trip somewhere.

142
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:58,766
How about it?

143
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:00,186
You guys take over one week.

144
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,067
We can do it.

145
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:01,667
We can do it.

146
00:08:01,688 --> 00:08:02,428
How about this?

147
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:13,415
We mine the store up here in the chilly North Pole, and you head down to where I filmed one of my movies, The Beautiful Island Nation of Hawaii.

148
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:14,796
Mrs. Claus?

149
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:17,138
Aloha, aloha.

150
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:18,699
Pack your bags.

151
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:19,900
Oh, the manual.

152
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,642
The boys need this manual.

153
00:08:24,084 --> 00:08:27,967
Read this thoroughly before you do any of your chores.

154
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:28,828
Okay.

155
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:29,268
Okay?

156
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:31,050
He's all in the manual.

157
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,171
Not a problem.

158
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:34,233
Piece of cake.

159
00:08:34,393 --> 00:08:35,975
Get your bags back.

160
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:37,256
I just packed a few things.

161
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:37,796
A few?

162
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:38,737
Come on, darling.

163
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:40,979
You got your rock collection in here?

164
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:41,780
Go on, I know.

165
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,881
We're going this way.

166
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:43,822
Hawaii's that way.

167
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:44,743
Bye, guys.

168
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:45,924
Aloha.

169
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:46,845
Bye.

170
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:48,647
Take care, brother and sister-in-law.

171
00:08:49,355 --> 00:08:49,895
That's it.

172
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:50,936
How about a song?

173
00:08:51,177 --> 00:08:52,298
I think we could do a song.

174
00:08:52,538 --> 00:08:53,519
How about this one?

175
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:57,402
Love me tender, love me true.

176
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:02,506
I will save Christmas with you.

177
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:04,208
I love how you just make stuff up.

178
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:04,808
Oh, thank you.

179
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:06,089
Thank you very much.

180
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:14,757
But maybe, maybe we should focus up and huddle up on what our first course of action would be, brother.

181
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:23,299
I think all we got to do is we got to get that reindeer and the sleigh and do the magic to get them flying all over the world.

182
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:23,919
We can do that.

183
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:24,820
It's not a big deal.

184
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,821
We just came in from the chilly cold.

185
00:09:27,081 --> 00:09:32,125
Why don't we start with something a little warmer, like wrapping those beautiful presents.

186
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:33,866
Oh, I can do that blindfolded.

187
00:09:33,946 --> 00:09:34,567
Not a big deal.

188
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,007
All righty.

189
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,548
Claus Brothers, high five.

190
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:37,629
That's it.

191
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:39,010
Be naughty or be nice.

192
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:39,910
Be on this list.

193
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:43,173
Let's get to Christmas wrapping.

194
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:44,434
You got it, bro.

195
00:09:45,214 --> 00:09:45,354
Oh.

196
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:47,476
Oh.

197
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:50,618
Trying to wrap some presents.

198
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:52,820
Don't know what to do.

199
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,843
I think we're so lost, I think we need more glue.

200
00:09:56,863 --> 00:10:00,786
Hey bro, you know how to do a ribbon?

201
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:02,087
Tie a bow?

202
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:03,127
How do you do this?

203
00:10:03,908 --> 00:10:09,032
I always had my stage hands help me with the ribbons and all my festoonments.

204
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:10,132
Listen.

205
00:10:10,873 --> 00:10:12,254
We're caught in a trap.

206
00:10:14,504 --> 00:10:16,185
I can't gift wrap.

207
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:22,409
I think I taped it too much, Brady.

208
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,872
How's that?

209
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:31,334
These are not up to our standards.

210
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:32,595
Really?

211
00:10:34,396 --> 00:10:36,578
Well, I think I have to call an audible then.

212
00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:40,300
We're going to have to do this later or find someone to help us.

213
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,442
Let's see what the manual says here.

214
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:49,824
He says, we're really in charge of Santa's sleigh, that we really should line up Santa's sleigh.

215
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:54,267
Step one, we need to line up the reindeer and then hook them up to each other.

216
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:55,328
Let's do that part of it.

217
00:10:55,348 --> 00:10:56,288
We can do that, can't we?

218
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:57,469
I think so, brother.

219
00:10:57,489 --> 00:10:57,949
All right.

220
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,270
We can manage that.

221
00:10:59,290 --> 00:10:59,931
Let's do that.

222
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:07,636
I used to have a bunch of gorgeous horses, and reindeer are just horses with a hood ornament on top.

223
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:10,358
I'll round up those galloping beauties.

224
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:14,283
and you get the sleigh ready to rock and roll!

225
00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:15,445
Rock and roll baby!

226
00:11:20,051 --> 00:11:24,638
Okay big brother, I've got these reindeer all lined up.

227
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:30,270
All right, let's look at the playbook here and see what the next thing is.

228
00:11:31,451 --> 00:11:35,934
Step three is crack the whip and we soar into the sky.

229
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:36,975
Sounds good.

230
00:11:37,415 --> 00:11:38,496
Here you go, brother.

231
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:39,357
There's the whip.

232
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,138
All right.

233
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:41,118
Red.

234
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:42,119
Green.

235
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,680
Forty-two.

236
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:44,921
Set.

237
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:45,402
Hike.

238
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:46,743
On Dasher.

239
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:47,503
On Dancer.

240
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,244
On Prancer.

241
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:48,945
On Vixen.

242
00:11:56,787 --> 00:11:57,508
This is not good.

243
00:11:57,768 --> 00:12:00,811
What in the tinsel tossing tarnation was that?

244
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:05,014
The reindeer just gave our sleigh the slip.

245
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:09,778
Step one, we line up the reindeer.

246
00:12:10,198 --> 00:12:11,259
Checkerino.

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,262
Step three, we crack the whip, right?

248
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:15,523
Checkeroonie.

249
00:12:16,263 --> 00:12:17,424
We forgot step two.

250
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:20,927
We didn't hook them up to the sleigh.

251
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:23,470
Oh, checka whoopsie.

252
00:12:24,548 --> 00:12:29,712
Don't be cruel to me, brother, for totally fumbling the ball at the end zone there.

253
00:12:30,112 --> 00:12:30,232
Oh.

254
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:32,674
I'm the guy that screwed up there.

255
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:33,455
I gronked it.

256
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:34,075
I'm sorry.

257
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:34,335
No.

258
00:12:34,475 --> 00:12:35,216
We gotta call.

259
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:36,177
We gotta call him.

260
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:40,640
We gotta give him a little jingle jangle on his Santa phone.

261
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:42,281
Oh, brother.

262
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:44,203
We're in the soup now.

263
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:56,672
Boy, this Hawaii is great, isn't it, honey?

264
00:12:57,072 --> 00:12:58,333
Oh, it sure is.

265
00:12:58,353 --> 00:13:00,854
I'm having such a good time.

266
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:02,855
We should do this more often.

267
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:03,595
Absolutely.

268
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,356
Thank God for my brothers, huh?

269
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:06,056
Oh, yes.

270
00:13:06,116 --> 00:13:08,977
Yeah.

271
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:12,239
It's the phone.

272
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:12,919
I better get it.

273
00:13:12,939 --> 00:13:15,800
Hello?

274
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:17,661
Hi, guys.

275
00:13:17,781 --> 00:13:18,201
What's up?

276
00:13:20,022 --> 00:13:22,263
What do you mean, you lost the reindeer?

277
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,202
and you're having trouble wrapping the gifts.

278
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:31,105
Well, the elves have a very high standard, you know.

279
00:13:33,466 --> 00:13:34,607
You want us to come back.

280
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:40,643
Let me ask Mrs. Claus, because she's having a wonderful time.

281
00:13:41,163 --> 00:13:42,904
Honey, the boys want us to return.

282
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:43,884
They're having problems.

283
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:46,305
Well, you tell those two brothers of yours.

284
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:47,405
They're on their own.

285
00:13:47,886 --> 00:13:50,347
We have a week, and we're going to keep the week.

286
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:54,928
By the way, I have to work on my tan.

287
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:55,688
You know that, dear.

288
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,209
And later, I have to get my nails done.

289
00:13:58,589 --> 00:13:59,970
Red, of course, of course.

290
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,451
And oh my goodness, I have a lesson.

291
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,412
It's a surfing lesson with the Duke.

292
00:14:06,152 --> 00:14:06,933
I'll see you later.

293
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:07,553
Bye.

294
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,716
I don't know if you heard that, guys, but you're out of luck.

295
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:12,636
You gotta figure it out.

296
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:14,017
Did you use the manual?

297
00:14:14,337 --> 00:14:15,818
I left you the manual.

298
00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:16,839
Did you use it?

299
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,440
You did.

300
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,621
But you left out a part or two.

301
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,465
We'll see you in another week.

302
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:27,686
Good luck.

303
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:30,007
They thought my job was easy.

304
00:14:30,448 --> 00:14:30,908
Bartender.

305
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:41,512
GJ, things look bad here up at the North Pole.

306
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:44,954
Do you think Christmas might get canceled?

307
00:14:47,255 --> 00:14:47,756
Yep.

308
00:14:50,337 --> 00:14:51,578
Maybe I can get help.

309
00:14:52,378 --> 00:14:54,379
Fortunately, Christmas isn't here yet.

310
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:59,362
If we can just hold things together till Santa gets back.

311
00:15:00,754 --> 00:15:04,736
What if we beam up some more helpers from around the world?

312
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,879
I have my special world travel app on my laptop.

313
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:13,801
I'll beam up some Norwegians to round up the reindeer.

314
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:23,927
And for wrapping the presents, how about some folks from Macy's gift wrap department?

315
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:24,848
Let's give it a try.

316
00:15:32,357 --> 00:15:35,119
We're back!

317
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,101
What a relief.

318
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:37,902
There you go.

319
00:15:38,122 --> 00:15:38,943
One for you.

320
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:40,324
There you go.

321
00:15:40,384 --> 00:15:44,687
Didn't want to mess your hair.

322
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:47,250
Aloha, aloha.

323
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,832
We're so happy to see you, brother.

324
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:54,636
Well, I gotta admit, you guys really did a good job.

325
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:59,380
You know, I had my doubts, and I must apologize.

326
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,017
The elves loved you guys.

327
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:04,445
You did a great job.

328
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:05,468
Great job.

329
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:07,666
Teamwork, that's what it's all about.

330
00:16:08,626 --> 00:16:10,507
But it's good to get home.

331
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:11,227
Yes it is.

332
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,368
It's good to get home.

333
00:16:12,748 --> 00:16:19,892
And I think I can speak for both of us in that we wouldn't have been able to do this if it wasn't for the help of Laura and Day.

334
00:16:20,532 --> 00:16:24,074
All the way from Medford Community Media.

335
00:16:24,114 --> 00:16:26,315
Thank you girls, thank you, thank you.

336
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:28,476
Thank you, thank you very much.

337
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:30,857
So maybe next year too?

338
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:37,171
let's do it all right all right but it's not that easy is it it's not that easy a job is it

339
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:38,794
No, but we love it.

340
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:39,274
We love it.

341
00:16:39,294 --> 00:16:40,255
We want to help the kids.

342
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:41,396
We want to help the community.

343
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:44,118
We want to help bring love and joy to the world.

344
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:49,521
And I told Mrs. Claus I want a football for Christmas so I can practice for next year.

345
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,742
No more fumbling.

346
00:16:50,782 --> 00:16:52,023
No more fumbling.

347
00:16:52,203 --> 00:17:01,390
It is so wonderful to see all the Claus brothers getting along so nicely, especially on Christmas.

348
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,894
What better way to kick off this moment of brotherly harmony than with a little music?

349
00:17:07,274 --> 00:17:08,255
Oh yeah!

350
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,635
You have a tune for us, bro?

351
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,097
Why don't we sing Blue Christmas here?

352
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:12,937
Oh, one of my favorites.

353
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:13,538
Here we go.

354
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,400
And a one, and a two, and a Christmas, here we go.

355
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:27,365
I'll have a blue Christmas without you.

356
00:17:28,706 --> 00:17:35,750
I'll be so blue just thinking about you.

357
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:48,721
Decorations were red on a green Christmas tree.

358
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:57,443
Won't be the same, dear, if you're not here with me.

359
00:17:57,763 --> 00:18:05,965
Some of those blue snowflakes are falling.

360
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:16,207
That's when those blue memories start calling.

361
00:18:17,407 --> 00:18:28,851
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white.

362
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:33,313
And I'll have a blue

363
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:46,168
Blue, blue, blue Christmas for us!

364
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:47,568
Yay!

365
00:18:47,608 --> 00:18:48,529
We got it!

366
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:49,269
We got it!

367
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,190
Merry Christmas!

368
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,752
Day, it's time to get back to the station.

369
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:53,192
Here we go!

370
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:11,642
Oh, that was great.

371
00:19:12,482 --> 00:19:17,724
It's always wonderful to see family members getting along, especially around Christmas.

372
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,105
I agree.

373
00:19:19,885 --> 00:19:20,386
No, yup.

374
00:19:22,407 --> 00:19:23,047
Thanks, Day.

375
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:23,847
All right.

376
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:25,248
Thanks for filming.

377
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:37,102
Now it's time to read one of my favorite books, The Night Before Christmas by Clement C. Moore.

378
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:40,824
Everyone get comfortable out there in TV land.

379
00:19:40,844 --> 00:19:57,450
"'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.

380
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,185
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care in hopes that St.

381
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,327
Nicholas soon would be there.

382
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:26,780
The children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads.

383
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:40,350
And Mama in her kerchief and I in my cap had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap.

384
00:20:46,673 --> 00:20:53,056
When out of the lawn there rose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.

385
00:20:53,976 --> 00:21:00,239
Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

386
00:21:01,373 --> 00:21:21,184
The moon on the breast of the new fallen snow gave the luster of midday to objects below, when what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature sleigh and a tiny reindeer.

387
00:21:26,888 --> 00:21:30,570
When a little old driver so lively and quick

388
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:34,589
I knew in a moment it must be Sank Nick.

389
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:44,614
More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name.

390
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:59,761
Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer and Bixen, on Comet, on Cupid, on Dancer and Blitzen, on top of the porch, on top of the wall, to the top of the wall, now dash away, dash away, dash away all.

391
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:10,450
as dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.

392
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:18,013
So up to the housetop, the coursers, they flew with a sleigh full of toys and St.

393
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:18,933
Nicholas too.

394
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:30,137
And then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof, the prancing and pawing of each little hoof.

395
00:22:37,671 --> 00:22:42,975
As I drew in my head and was turning around, down the chimney, St.

396
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:45,077
Nicholas came with a bound.

397
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:57,666
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.

398
00:22:58,927 --> 00:23:05,472
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his path.

399
00:23:08,462 --> 00:23:11,223
His eyes, how they twinkled!

400
00:23:12,123 --> 00:23:13,923
His dimples, how merry!

401
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:18,184
His cheeps were like roses, his nose like a cherry.

402
00:23:19,444 --> 00:23:27,025
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.

403
00:23:27,045 --> 00:23:34,847
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke had encircled his head like a wreath.

404
00:23:35,985 --> 00:23:44,268
He had a broad face and a little round belly that shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly.

405
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:44,328
Ho!

406
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:45,548
Ho!

407
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:45,969
Ho!

408
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:51,591
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf.

409
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:55,772
And I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself.

410
00:23:57,073 --> 00:24:03,475
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.

411
00:24:05,347 --> 00:24:22,319
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk, and laying his finger aside of his nose, and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.

412
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:32,486
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, and away they all flew, like the down of a thistle.

413
00:24:33,843 --> 00:24:37,624
But I heard him exclaim, ere he rode out of sight.

414
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:44,326
Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night.

415
00:24:50,468 --> 00:24:52,749
Did all of you enjoy that as much as I did?

416
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:55,890
Now it's time to say goodbye.

417
00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:03,012
This is Laura Duggan, your hostess, hoping to see you again on Looking Back at Medford History.

418
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:14,092
and I and everyone here at Metro Community Media want to wish all a very merry Christmas and a happy new year.

419
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:32,578
♪ Oh well those blue snowflakes are falling ♪ ♪ That's when those blue memories start calling ♪

420
00:25:34,812 --> 00:25:45,818
We'll be doing all right with your Christmas up wide.

421
00:25:46,758 --> 00:26:02,687
And I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas.

422
00:26:04,092 --> 00:26:04,773
We got it!

423
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,114
Merry Christmas everybody!
