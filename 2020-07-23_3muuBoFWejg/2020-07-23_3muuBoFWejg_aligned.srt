00:00:00,692 --> 00:00:03,716
I'm Anna Callahan, I'm running for state rep, suffer engineer and mom.

2
00:00:05,098 --> 00:00:07,741
And then I ask, do you know much about the state house?

3
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:08,642
And they're like, not really.

4
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:13,208
And I'm like, oh well, I'll tell you two fun facts that you can share with your friends.

5
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:17,434
Number one is that there's no way for any of us to know how our state reps are voting.

6
00:00:17,634 --> 00:00:25,064
And number two is that the last three speakers of the house have all been convicted of felonies related to corruption and bribery.
