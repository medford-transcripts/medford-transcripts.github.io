I'm Anna Callahan, I'm running for state rep, suffer engineer and mom. And then I ask, do you know much about the state house? And they're like, not really. And I'm like, oh well, I'll tell you two fun facts that you can share with your friends. Number one is that there's no way for any of us to know how our state reps are voting. And number two is that the last three speakers of the house have all been convicted of felonies related to corruption and bribery.
