Hello, this is Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern. I have some good news for the week, and I'm going to focus on all the great things going on in September. So first up, we are not going to have our ribbon-cutting for Hickey Park's new tennis courts and basketball courts today due to the rain. We are going to move that to next Wednesday, September 20th at 3 p.m. So please come on down and join us. We're going to have a fun knockout tournament. I'm going to be playing as well.

We'll be dedicating the track right at 4.30 and then rolling after that are the Kids Fun Runs, the Power Mile, the Mayor's Celebrity Mile, and then we'll land at the Fort afterwards to celebrate Dave McGillivray, who the track is being named after. And then on Saturday, September 23rd, is our five-mile race and our two-mile walk here at City Hall.
