147
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:40,875
[SPEAKER_53]: You can either do it online with the Secretary of State's office or you can come in person or you can request about through our office which we can mail out, not a ballot but a request for a ballot, then we mailed about ballots will probably be mailed out by the end of August.

148
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:42,337
[SPEAKER_53]: Once we get them in.

149
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:55,121

150
00:26:56,923 --> 00:27:01,388

152
00:27:03,227 --> 00:27:12,516

00:27:25,272 --> 00:27:27,294
[SPEAKER_65]: the one that we had issued.

158
00:27:27,754 --> 00:27:32,497
[SPEAKER_65]: We have every polling place in Medford carpet, the same that are listed here.

159
00:27:33,178 --> 00:27:35,680
[SPEAKER_65]: The only one we had issued was the walking court.

160
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,562
[SPEAKER_65]: We will bless it's still operational.

161
00:27:40,363 --> 00:27:40,583
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

162
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:52,912
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we have any questions for... Do we have any questions for the elections manager or the members of the Elections Commission?

163
00:27:52,992 --> 00:27:53,833
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

164
00:27:55,684 --> 00:28:07,078
[SPEAKER_29]: I know I've spoken with the director and, and I know that they're typical metric rumors that, what is it we only have like 12 people registered to vote, and that was dispelled.

165
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:13,065
[SPEAKER_29]: So, I think that the office did a very good job for people that didn't complete their census.

166
00:28:13,932 --> 00:28:23,717
[SPEAKER_29]: Something came postcard came in the mail, and that would remind everybody to please send that in so they can be added to the role again so I think it's very simple.

167
00:28:24,257 --> 00:28:31,241
[SPEAKER_29]: It's nothing that's groundbreaking but I know that we talked I want to make sure that if people did get that postcard.

168
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:34,184
[SPEAKER_29]: that they fill that in and send that in as soon as possible.

169
00:28:34,725 --> 00:28:36,748
[SPEAKER_29]: So to avoid any issues so thank you.

170
00:28:36,768 --> 00:28:40,873
[SPEAKER_53]: Yeah, so just as a bit of a civic education for anyone listening.

171
00:28:41,795 --> 00:28:48,343
[SPEAKER_53]: Every year, this is a yearly thing this isn't every 10 years, every single year, city of Medford is supposed to send out a census.

172
00:28:49,492 --> 00:28:51,092
[SPEAKER_53]: residents are supposed to fill it out and get it back.

173
00:28:51,172 --> 00:28:57,834
[SPEAKER_53]: If you do not do that, you're inactivated, which means you're still a registered voter, which means you still can go to the polls.

174
00:28:58,294 --> 00:29:01,835
[SPEAKER_53]: You would just need to usually show an ID, sign an affidavit.

175
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:17,458
[SPEAKER_53]: But we give you one more chance prior to elections most of the time, that postcard we send out around the end of June, beginning of July, if you sign that, send it back to us, you're activated, and then you don't have to worry about bringing an ID to the polls or anything like that.

176
00:29:21,632 --> 00:29:21,992
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

177
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:25,455
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we have any further questions for the elections manager?

178
00:29:27,676 --> 00:29:28,017
[SPEAKER_53]: If I may.

179
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:29,197
[SPEAKER_24]: Go ahead, Jim.

180
00:29:29,758 --> 00:29:34,681
[SPEAKER_53]: To answer your previous question, the list of where you can find your polling location is on the website.

181
00:29:34,842 --> 00:29:40,245
[SPEAKER_53]: Additionally, you can go to the Secretary of State's website and you can type in your address and it'll give you a polling location as well.

182
00:29:40,406 --> 00:29:40,646
[SPEAKER_53]: Great.

183
00:29:40,926 --> 00:29:41,987
[SPEAKER_65]: Thank you.

184
00:29:42,707 --> 00:29:46,570
[SPEAKER_65]: It will also be posted outside here.

185
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,192
[SPEAKER_65]: It will also be posted at the library.

186
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,511
[SPEAKER_65]: Because by law, we have to do that.

187
00:29:52,172 --> 00:29:52,332
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

188
00:29:52,352 --> 00:29:53,653
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

189
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:55,715
[SPEAKER_24]: Any further questions by members of the council?

190
00:29:58,617 --> 00:29:59,597

[SPEAKER_04]: I'm unmuted.

241
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:51,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

242
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:52,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everyone.

243
00:32:55,739 --> 00:32:56,060
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

244
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,042
[SPEAKER_24]: We can hear you and you should be able to start video and if you want to share your presentation.

245
00:33:00,702 --> 00:33:01,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, perfect.

246
00:33:02,073 --> 00:33:03,954
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me start a video.

247
00:33:05,175 --> 00:33:06,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize.

248
00:33:06,356 --> 00:33:09,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a second to figure out how to share my screen.

249
00:33:17,143 --> 00:33:19,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Does everyone see my screen?

250
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:20,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I will make it larger.

251
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:23,707
[SPEAKER_42]: I want the presentation.

252
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:27,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it switched screens on me.

253
00:33:27,637 --> 00:33:28,798
[SPEAKER_24]: We can't see your screen.

254
00:33:28,898 --> 00:33:30,399
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not in slideshow.

255
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:33,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it decided to switch screens on me.

256
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:35,183
[SPEAKER_04]: One second.

257
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:35,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

258
00:33:35,923 --> 00:33:37,505
[SPEAKER_04]: It popped up on my opposite screen.

259
00:33:53,057 --> 00:33:53,557
[SPEAKER_70]: It's this one.

260
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:00,316
[SPEAKER_22]: We can see your screen.

261
00:34:00,897 --> 00:34:01,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

262
00:34:01,677 --> 00:34:02,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

263
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:02,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

264
00:34:04,338 --> 00:34:05,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everyone.

265
00:34:05,699 --> 00:34:06,800
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Katie Moulton.

266
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,901
[SPEAKER_04]: I work for WSP.

267
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:15,504
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a consultant working with the MBTA on the plan for accessible transit infrastructure.

268
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:24,928
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a program that the MBTA is running to make all bus stops within their system accessible for all riders.

269
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:28,250
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of the work includes making

270
00:34:29,218 --> 00:34:37,144
[SPEAKER_04]: fully accessible bus stops, as well as accessible curb ramps and safe crossings between all the paired stops.

271
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:43,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, we're here to talk about a single stop in Medford.

272
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:56,618
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal of these projects, as I said, is to slow down vehicles and to make sure that people feel safe accessing these bus stops, they feel safe standing on the sidewalk,

273
00:34:58,407 --> 00:35:03,770
[SPEAKER_04]: and looking to give them the best access to the MBTA system.

274
00:35:06,031 --> 00:35:11,673
[SPEAKER_04]: So currently the existing stop that we're looking at is on Boston Ave right at the Tufts Garage.

275
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:23,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the city has some work ongoing here right now and they've relocated that stop so that the work for the garage is ongoing.

276
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,880
[SPEAKER_04]: This current, as you can see on the screen,

277
00:35:27,532 --> 00:35:31,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Neither of the existing curb ramps are ADA accessible.

278
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,556
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have detectable warning panels.

279
00:35:34,216 --> 00:35:45,463
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just not an ideal location as this crossing is not in the closest proximity to the entrance to the MBTA station.

280
00:35:46,804 --> 00:35:48,245
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize, I have an old one up.

281
00:35:48,305 --> 00:35:49,626
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not the green line station.

282
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:50,986
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the orange line station.

283
00:35:51,086 --> 00:35:52,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize for that.

284
00:35:53,508 --> 00:35:56,830
[SPEAKER_04]: But what the goal would be is that we would be proposing

285
00:35:57,931 --> 00:36:06,454
[SPEAKER_04]: to relocate this existing stop up closer to the Boston Ave and College Ave intersection.

286
00:36:07,494 --> 00:36:21,738
[SPEAKER_04]: The city has already worked on improving the crossings at this entire intersection, improving signals, and all of this sidewalk and the curb ramps at Boston Ave have already been improved.

287
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:26,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we would like to do is relocate the Tufts Garage bus stop

288
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:33,699
[SPEAKER_04]: closer to the intersection, which would give people better access to the entrance to the Orange Line station.

289
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,482
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the paired stop going northbound on Boston Ave is still not ideal and it's still not accessible.

290
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:49,363
[SPEAKER_04]: So the work we're proposing would just be for this side of the street over here.

291
00:36:49,383 --> 00:36:54,984
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see, this is where we are.

292
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,165
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the intersection on

293
00:36:57,763 --> 00:37:01,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Page left over here, this would be the existing bus stop.

294
00:37:01,765 --> 00:37:07,669
[SPEAKER_04]: It would not impact the accessible parking that is here, and it would be pulled off onto the shoulder.

295
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:12,331
[SPEAKER_04]: There are two portions of the bus stop that are critical for all passengers.

296
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:22,757
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one is the landing area, which is where the bus ramp deploys for mobility-impaired riders to be able to board and deboard the buses.

297
00:37:23,698 --> 00:37:27,360
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the goal is to have an eight-foot by 10-foot landing area.

298
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:31,989
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the clear zone is in the back, which is the rear door to the bus.

299
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:36,871
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see in the northbound direction, this stop is fully compliant.

300
00:37:37,451 --> 00:37:43,113
[SPEAKER_04]: However, in the southbound direction, it is not exactly what we need.

301
00:37:43,934 --> 00:37:50,076
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a existing fence line that runs parallel to it, which we would not be impacting.

302
00:37:50,176 --> 00:37:54,598
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not have any plans to impede on the Tufts College

303
00:37:55,432 --> 00:37:58,334
[SPEAKER_04]: property, all of the work we're proposing would be within the city.

304
00:37:59,434 --> 00:38:06,458
[SPEAKER_04]: We would be repaving a section of the sidewalk, putting in some grass behind it just to make sure it goes back to its original conditions.

305
00:38:06,998 --> 00:38:13,162
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have a 10 foot by six foot landing area, and then a five foot by 10 foot clear zone.

306
00:38:14,622 --> 00:38:22,847
[SPEAKER_04]: We tried to shift this bus stop far enough back so it was not to impact the right turn lane that is currently used by drivers.

307
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:27,284
[SPEAKER_04]: And additionally, technically, there is no parking.

308
00:38:27,624 --> 00:38:29,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on the signage on the street, there is no parking here.

309
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:37,227
[SPEAKER_04]: So there additionally would not be any impacts to parking with the proposed work that we are recommending.

310
00:38:38,728 --> 00:38:52,532
[SPEAKER_04]: We would, if I go back, once this work has been completed, the MBTA service planning would come back and deactivate

311
00:38:53,107 --> 00:38:55,208
[SPEAKER_04]: This location, they would put up all the signs.

312
00:38:55,588 --> 00:39:06,134
[SPEAKER_04]: They would make sure that all riders are aware of the relocated bus stop and make sure that there are signs out and that the riders are notified in advance of this change.

313
00:39:06,615 --> 00:39:17,861
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we would be removing the existing signage, removing the existing pavement markings, putting in new pavement markings, and then potentially opening up this area for increased parking.

314
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:25,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Ben is the project manager for the MBTA on this project.

315
00:39:25,649 --> 00:39:27,110
[SPEAKER_04]: He's with us here tonight.

316
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:37,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So this design has been reviewed by the Medford Transportation Division, and they are in approval of this work.

317
00:39:37,816 --> 00:39:40,557
[SPEAKER_04]: The intent right now is to build that this summer.

318
00:39:41,197 --> 00:39:44,059
[SPEAKER_04]: This location is a high priority for the MBTA.

319
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:44,779
[SPEAKER_04]: It's critical.

320
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,743
[SPEAKER_04]: And the MBTA has asked us to expedite the work at this location so that this work can be completed

321
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:54,928
[SPEAKER_04]: by our on-call contractor in Newport Construction.

322
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:59,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would likely be done sometime late summer or early fall of this year.

323
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:05,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Work would take approximately two to three weeks as it's relatively minor work.

324
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:08,155
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be limited impacts to the riders.

325
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:17,700
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm gonna turn it over to Ben to see if he has any additional comments or if there's any questions from anyone on the council.

326
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:25,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks Katie and thanks the president and all council members for tonight to give us the opportunity to introduce this critical stop.

327
00:40:25,849 --> 00:40:48,023
[SPEAKER_13]: We receive a lot of requests from the city and our partners and riders, including the MBTA internal stakeholders to ask us to accelerate this one bus stop due to the high ridership, you know, bus stop and use connection to the Green Line Station, Medford and Tufts Station.

328
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:57,948
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why tonight we would like to submit this 100% design to the city council member to review and give us approval.

329
00:40:58,528 --> 00:41:03,030
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in case we can use this summertime to accelerate the construction.

330
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:07,212
[SPEAKER_13]: So we want to make sure before the October, we can finish all the construction.

331
00:41:07,853 --> 00:41:16,177
[SPEAKER_13]: So make this stop with full access and for use to all the riders and community members.

332
00:41:17,347 --> 00:41:26,692
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's all tonight and then we would like to ask any questions for us and then we would like to answer.

333
00:41:30,042 --> 00:41:30,242
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

334
00:41:30,342 --> 00:41:30,962
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Ben.

335
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:31,743
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Katie.

336
00:41:32,343 --> 00:41:33,784
[SPEAKER_24]: Appreciate this work.

337
00:41:33,884 --> 00:41:41,847
[SPEAKER_24]: This is an important priority to improve bus connectivity and accessibility near the new Medford Tufts Greenline station.

338
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:53,032
[SPEAKER_24]: So I know a lot of residents have been talking about this and asking for it and our traffic direct and transportation director and our traffic team are consider this a priority and

339
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,073
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm glad that we can consider it tonight.

340
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,955
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to go to members of the council for questions.

341
00:41:58,615 --> 00:42:01,117
[SPEAKER_24]: We go to Councilor Lazzaro, then Councilor Scarpelli.

342
00:42:01,157 --> 00:42:02,037
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Lazzaro.

343
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:02,958
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

344
00:42:03,138 --> 00:42:05,939
[SPEAKER_60]: I appreciate your presentation on this.

345
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:10,722
[SPEAKER_60]: I think it's really wonderful to have ADA compliance be prioritized.

346
00:42:10,782 --> 00:42:14,104
[SPEAKER_60]: I'm so grateful that this work is being done.

347
00:42:14,304 --> 00:42:18,687
[SPEAKER_60]: One question I have is if there are announcements or

348
00:42:19,487 --> 00:42:21,968
[SPEAKER_60]: lighting changes that will be made to the stop.

349
00:42:22,008 --> 00:42:32,594
[SPEAKER_60]: We had just a little bit of confusion with communication when we had an ADA compliance update done on a train stop recently.

350
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:40,278
[SPEAKER_60]: Is there like a contact that we will have after the completion of the work or in the process

351
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,420
[SPEAKER_60]: just to follow up for the neighbors.

352
00:42:43,700 --> 00:43:04,026
[SPEAKER_60]: We had a slight issue that I think is now resolved, but just want to be able to verify that as the ADA compliance work is done so that people who have hearing or sight issues are able to access the stop better, that the neighbors are still able to balance their needs.

353
00:43:05,847 --> 00:43:08,128
[SPEAKER_60]: But I really appreciate that this is being done.

354
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:09,188
[SPEAKER_60]: I know it's very important.

355
00:43:11,342 --> 00:43:15,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, so in construction, the Newport construction, his name is Tom.

356
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:19,726
[SPEAKER_04]: He will put out flyers and he will post flyers around.

357
00:43:20,987 --> 00:43:22,708
[SPEAKER_04]: So normally that goes to abutters.

358
00:43:22,828 --> 00:43:26,670
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of the abutters are Tufts and the train system.

359
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:30,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this location, most likely we could post flyers.

360
00:43:31,132 --> 00:43:38,275
[SPEAKER_04]: There will probably be sandwich boards out in the weeks upcoming to while Tom's working to let people know that the stop is gonna be relocated.

361
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:45,994
[SPEAKER_04]: So during construction, all questions, Tom usually provides his cell phone number so that if there's any questions, he's accessible.

362
00:43:46,574 --> 00:43:51,676
[SPEAKER_04]: He would also be pulling permits with the city, so you would have his contact information as well through that process.

363
00:43:52,537 --> 00:43:54,898
[SPEAKER_04]: We've included Ben's contact number on here.

364
00:43:55,018 --> 00:43:56,939
[SPEAKER_04]: He's the MBTA project manager.

365
00:43:56,959 --> 00:44:04,782
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as always, your service planning representative would always be available for any questions and concerns as well after the process.

366
00:44:07,826 --> 00:44:08,106
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

367
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:15,615
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, just to clarify, are there going to be any changes made to lighting or will there be sound installations that don't currently exist?

368
00:44:16,036 --> 00:44:17,518
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, that is not normally.

369
00:44:17,558 --> 00:44:22,624
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of our work is just kind of sidewalks and curb ramps.

370
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:27,109
[SPEAKER_04]: We try to keep it simple and straightforward, the majority of the work.

371
00:44:28,717 --> 00:44:29,138
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

372
00:44:30,439 --> 00:44:31,961
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

373
00:44:32,442 --> 00:44:47,601
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you Mr. President again I appreciate the presentation but I'm just a little confused we're not are we moving to this for this project to move move forward tonight or or is this just the presentation I think it's important that I'm hearing that

374
00:44:48,254 --> 00:45:06,608
[SPEAKER_29]: the construction team will be sending out notices but one thing we've heard you know pretty resoundingly throughout the community is anytime we're doing something our community is really not understanding and knowing the issues and concerns so when it comes time to it it's too late because they haven't been involved so

375
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:10,772
[SPEAKER_29]: I would if that's the case, I'd like to slow things down again.

376
00:45:11,152 --> 00:45:15,034
[SPEAKER_29]: We're talking about, um, 1st of August meeting in the summer.

377
00:45:15,054 --> 00:45:16,755
[SPEAKER_29]: Not too many people are paying attention.

378
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:21,777
[SPEAKER_29]: And then, uh, and then we don't meet again until September.

379
00:45:21,837 --> 00:45:24,838
[SPEAKER_29]: So I think that it's important that that we look at

380
00:45:25,778 --> 00:45:48,725
[SPEAKER_29]: any initiative that we're putting forth that we slow things down and present it to the residents, especially in that neighborhood, that they're informed properly so they can ask the proper questions that usually arise after construction work is being done and residents are then left in limbo without any recourse.

381
00:45:48,765 --> 00:45:52,486
[SPEAKER_29]: So I would make that as a motion, Mr. President.

382
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,661
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion to table by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by.

383
00:45:57,681 --> 00:46:10,748
[SPEAKER_24]: Hearing no second, are there any other motions or questions?

384
00:46:17,351 --> 00:46:18,352
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Collins.

385
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,320
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, President Bears.

386
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:23,022
[SPEAKER_64]: I want to extend my thanks to the MBTA for their presentation tonight.

387
00:46:25,223 --> 00:46:30,325
[SPEAKER_64]: You know, there are many people in Medford who rely on bus service to commute to get where they need to go.

388
00:46:30,385 --> 00:46:35,108
[SPEAKER_64]: There are many, many bus stops in Medford where we know that maintenance and improvements are.

389
00:46:36,842 --> 00:46:39,163
[SPEAKER_64]: urgently needed, especially when it comes to ADA upgrades.

390
00:46:40,023 --> 00:46:44,485
[SPEAKER_64]: I appreciate the clarity around this and the updates on the timeline for the rollout.

391
00:46:44,926 --> 00:46:55,330
[SPEAKER_64]: And I am eager to see the shot clock on these updates begin as soon as possible so that riders can begin to see a better experience at their bus stops.

392
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,291
[SPEAKER_64]: I would motion to approve.

393
00:46:58,291 --> 00:47:00,712
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by.

394
00:47:01,933 --> 00:47:03,033
[SPEAKER_24]: Seconded by Councilor Leming.

395
00:47:03,074 --> 00:47:04,014
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

396
00:47:11,457 --> 00:47:12,457
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Callahan is absent.

397
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:20,441
[SPEAKER_68]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Tseng.

398
00:47:21,062 --> 00:47:21,302
[SPEAKER_68]: Yes.

399
00:47:22,702 --> 00:47:23,323

400
00:47:23,703 --> 00:47:23,963
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

401
00:47:23,983 --> 00:47:26,064
[SPEAKER_24]: I have the affirmative, one of the negative, one absent.

402
00:47:26,084 --> 00:47:27,004
[SPEAKER_24]: The motion passes.

403
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:31,727
[SPEAKER_24]: Communications from the Mayor 25126 submitted by Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

404
00:47:33,347 --> 00:47:34,028
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry about that.

405
00:47:34,108 --> 00:47:34,648
[SPEAKER_24]: One second.

406
00:47:37,663 --> 00:47:55,275
[SPEAKER_24]: Dear President Bears and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body, in accordance with Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 138, Sections 4 and 5, approve the appointment of Mark Lally, 3 Smith Lane, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, to the Garden Commission for a term of three years to expire November 18th, 2028.

[SPEAKER_24]: Mark will be present via Zoom.

408
00:47:57,517 --> 00:47:59,598
[SPEAKER_24]: Copies of their resume and appointment letters are attached.

409
00:47:59,698 --> 00:48:01,359
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

410
00:48:01,419 --> 00:48:02,940
[SPEAKER_24]: Sincerely, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

411
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,002
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we have Mark on Zoom?

412
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:06,763
[SPEAKER_24]: Mark, could you raise your hand?

413
00:48:09,976 --> 00:48:10,236
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

414
00:48:10,396 --> 00:48:16,521
[SPEAKER_24]: Mark, I'm going to let you turn on your video, and then we'll request you to unmute.

415
00:48:17,682 --> 00:48:19,904
[SPEAKER_24]: You should be able to turn on your video now if you'd like to do that.

416
00:48:22,726 --> 00:48:26,970
[SPEAKER_39]: I unfortunately do not have a webcam, so I can't turn on video, but I am here and present.

417
00:48:28,157 --> 00:48:28,797
[SPEAKER_24]: That's okay.

418
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:29,777
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for being here.

419
00:48:30,478 --> 00:48:33,559
[SPEAKER_24]: We've received your request for appointment by the mayor.

420
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,721
[SPEAKER_24]: Is there anything else you'd like to share about why you'd like to be on the garden commission or anything else you'd like the council to know?

421
00:48:42,061 --> 00:48:44,442
[SPEAKER_39]: I would just like to say that I have a passion for gardening.

422
00:48:44,462 --> 00:48:53,664
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm happy to report that this past year I was able to ferment my first wine from Medford grown grape vines.

423
00:48:54,104 --> 00:48:55,685
[SPEAKER_39]: And I'm just very excited to

424
00:48:57,005 --> 00:48:58,465
[SPEAKER_39]: help more people in the city garden.

425
00:49:00,446 --> 00:49:00,666
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

426
00:49:01,006 --> 00:49:01,526
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks, Mark.

427
00:49:01,546 --> 00:49:03,226
[SPEAKER_24]: Do we have any questions for members of the Council?

428
00:49:06,687 --> 00:49:08,047
[SPEAKER_24]: Hearing and seeing none, is there a motion?

429
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:13,228

[SPEAKER_24]: Mark, invite me over for some of Medford's own sometime.

445
00:49:41,692 --> 00:49:42,033
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

446
00:49:42,073 --> 00:49:42,413
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

447
00:49:44,435 --> 00:49:44,795
[SPEAKER_24]: All right.

448
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:51,161
[SPEAKER_24]: Reverting back to the regular order of business, motions, orders, and resolutions.

449
00:49:52,396 --> 00:50:00,149
[SPEAKER_24]: 25103 offered by Vice President Collins proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance other quarters districts for referrals to the Community Development Board Vice President Collins.

450
00:50:02,637 --> 00:50:03,378
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, President Bears.

451
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:16,830
[SPEAKER_64]: While I am not in favor of slowing down this council's work on overhaul of our zoning ordinance, I do understand that the CBB is between CORA right now, between quorums right now.

452
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:22,655
[SPEAKER_64]: So I would recommend that we hold this referral until they are procedurally able to open their hearing on it.

453
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:26,098
[SPEAKER_64]: That would be a motion to table until our September 9th regular meeting.

454
00:50:26,678 --> 00:50:36,622
[SPEAKER_24]: On the motion to table paper 250103 to the September 9th regular meeting by Vice President Collins seconded by seconded by Councilor Leming, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

455
00:50:41,564 --> 00:50:43,024

00:50:55,249 --> 00:50:55,769
[SPEAKER_68]: President Bears.

463
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:59,842
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, it's the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes and the measure is tabled.

464
00:50:59,862 --> 00:51:17,730
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to turn the chair over to Vice President Collins.

465
00:52:00,097 --> 00:52:01,127
[SPEAKER_64]: Sorry, we have different setups.

466
00:52:36,955 --> 00:52:37,019
you

467
00:52:59,793 --> 00:53:07,016
[SPEAKER_64]: Paper 25-015, offered by President Bears, Values Aligned Local Investments Ordinance.

468
00:53:08,636 --> 00:53:12,838
[SPEAKER_64]: Is there a motion to waive reading of the ordinance for a summary by the proponent?

469
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:26,343
[SPEAKER_64]: Great, on the motion to waive reading of the ordinance in favor of a summary by the proponent, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

470
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:31,194
[SPEAKER_64]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

471
00:53:35,256 --> 00:53:35,936
[SPEAKER_68]: Two way breeding.

472
00:53:36,276 --> 00:53:37,656
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Callahan is absent.

473
00:53:39,297 --> 00:53:40,017
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Lazzaro.

474
00:53:43,138 --> 00:53:43,678
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Leming.

475
00:53:44,778 --> 00:53:45,479
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Scarpelli.

476
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:47,919
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Tseng.

477
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,080
[SPEAKER_70]: Yes.

478
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,700
[SPEAKER_68]: President Bears.

479
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:52,321
[SPEAKER_69]: Yes.

480
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:53,861
[SPEAKER_68]: Vice President Collins.

481
00:53:54,782 --> 00:53:55,002
[SPEAKER_64]: Yes.

482
00:53:55,402 --> 00:53:57,262
[SPEAKER_64]: Five in favor, one opposed, one absent.

483
00:53:57,302 --> 00:53:58,103
[SPEAKER_64]: Motion passes.

484
00:53:58,663 --> 00:53:59,403
[SPEAKER_64]: Go ahead, President Bears.

485
00:54:01,168 --> 00:54:03,829
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Vice President Collins, and thank you for chairing the meeting.

486
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:08,371
[SPEAKER_24]: This is our second meeting where we have this formally on the agenda.

487
00:54:08,971 --> 00:54:27,260
[SPEAKER_24]: It was tabled, well, it was delayed by a councilor delay on June 24th, and then further tabled on July 15th to have more time for discussions with city staff and incorporate some changes that I believe address

488
00:54:28,933 --> 00:54:33,102
[SPEAKER_24]: some ability to implement and also make clear the intent of this ordinance.

489
00:54:34,427 --> 00:54:39,068
[SPEAKER_24]: I spoke at length on June 24th about why I proposed this ordinance.

490
00:54:39,628 --> 00:54:44,930
[SPEAKER_24]: We've heard from many residents about this ordinance and how they feel about it and their opinions on it.

491
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:49,711
[SPEAKER_24]: But at the end of the day, the purpose intent is written into the ordinance itself.

492
00:54:49,831 --> 00:55:02,975
[SPEAKER_24]: It says the city of Manfred will strive to invest its funds in ways that promote the wellbeing of our communities and our environment, favoring investment of its funds and entities that support the needs of peacetime and daily life and meet the city's goals of conducting local government in a quote,

493
00:55:03,515 --> 00:55:08,497
[SPEAKER_24]: accountable, transparent, innovative, stable, ethical, representative, and responsible way.

494
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:12,578
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's what this ordinance does, Madam Chair.

495
00:55:13,318 --> 00:55:20,180
[SPEAKER_24]: We are in a unique moment in this world where we are seeing ecocide at incredible levels.

496
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:32,924
[SPEAKER_24]: Our planet is being destroyed by corporations who care more about next quarter's profit than the continued existence of our ecosystems and the ability of humans to stay alive on this planet.

497
00:55:33,987 --> 00:55:48,733
[SPEAKER_24]: We are seeing a federal administration that is partnering with for profit private prisons and detention centers to lock people up, in many cases, extra legally, and then

498
00:55:50,136 --> 00:55:52,817
[SPEAKER_24]: trade that on the open market for profit.

499
00:55:53,638 --> 00:56:17,090
[SPEAKER_24]: We are seeing weapons manufacturers and right-wing extremists across the world fomenting violence and killing and destruction in countries on nearly every continent, again, for profit and for next quarter's earnings rather than the injuries and death that we're seeing

500
00:56:18,553 --> 00:56:21,795
[SPEAKER_24]: to so many people, especially so many children.

501
00:56:21,815 --> 00:56:34,721
[SPEAKER_24]: And we are seeing a federal administration and a global right-wing movement that is committing massive human rights violations across the world, in countries across the world.

502
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:38,022
[SPEAKER_24]: They are abetting each other, they are supporting each other.

503
00:56:40,603 --> 00:56:45,366
[SPEAKER_24]: Homes destroyed, families completely wiped out, and

504
00:56:47,410 --> 00:57:14,682
[SPEAKER_24]: it is essential that all of us, whether that's us as individuals, us as communities, us as organizations, or working together through local government, that we say that if we have funds, if we have these public funds, we are not going to invest them in this global effort that disregards and dehumanizes people

505
00:57:16,097 --> 00:57:25,545
[SPEAKER_24]: in so many different ways, whether that's for political gain, or for private profit, or in many cases, both in the never ending cycle of destruction and violence.

506
00:57:27,186 --> 00:57:30,449
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not a fun picture to paint, but it's the world that we're living in right now.

507
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:35,673
[SPEAKER_24]: And this ordinance says that in Medford, we're not going to put our public funds into that system.

508
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:46,479
[SPEAKER_24]: I have been grateful to meet with several residents, residents who have concerns, concerns about what the ordinance's intent is.

509
00:57:46,499 --> 00:57:51,103
[SPEAKER_24]: I think there are some edits in here that better define what that is.

510
00:57:51,123 --> 00:57:52,845
[SPEAKER_24]: I really appreciate meeting with

511
00:57:53,688 --> 00:58:11,614
[SPEAKER_24]: the city administration, the treasurer collector, the chair of the commissioners of trust funds, especially also meeting with the retirement fund, even though retirement funds are excluded from this ordinance, they were able to do an analysis and provide a framework

512
00:58:12,334 --> 00:58:16,556
[SPEAKER_24]: for how to look at funds and how they would apply under these conditions.

513
00:58:17,176 --> 00:58:23,039
[SPEAKER_24]: And you can see that in the updated section 2698B.

514
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:33,384
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a very clear framework called the MSCI ESG, that's Environmental Social Governance, Controversies and Global Norms Methodology.

515
00:58:34,404 --> 00:58:38,086
[SPEAKER_24]: That comes from the financial industry itself, which I know

516
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:44,850
[SPEAKER_24]: I and others have issues with, but it provides a clear framework for the implementation of this ordinance.

517
00:58:45,891 --> 00:59:00,677
[SPEAKER_24]: They use data and create this methodology and framework to determine what companies are, for example, complicit in human rights violations.

518
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:04,118
[SPEAKER_24]: They take a number of global

519
00:59:05,407 --> 00:59:09,269
[SPEAKER_24]: international law, international conventions and treaties to make those determinations.

520
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:27,361
[SPEAKER_24]: And they are a group that many folks who are thinking about how to invest their money look towards to make determinations about who is violating the basic norms and foundations of international law for profit.

521
00:59:28,342 --> 00:59:32,949
[SPEAKER_24]: So I want to thank the folks from the Retirement Fund for pointing out this methodology.

522
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:41,061
[SPEAKER_24]: They did an analysis of their funds and most of these funds are for the Retirement Fund are not

523
00:59:42,133 --> 00:59:44,114
[SPEAKER_24]: invested in any of these areas, not all.

524
00:59:45,095 --> 01:00:02,487
[SPEAKER_24]: And I also just want to thank folks from the Retirement Fund as well for our meeting where they pointed out that while this ordinance wouldn't apply to them, there are a number of restrictions already in place in state law, particularly as relates to weapons manufacturers, where our retirement funds are not invested in that right now.

525
01:00:03,288 --> 01:00:07,831
[SPEAKER_24]: And while this is what we can do here for the funds that law allows us to

526
01:00:10,396 --> 01:00:10,876
[SPEAKER_24]: work with.

527
01:00:11,997 --> 01:00:24,327
[SPEAKER_24]: I also am hopeful that the state will take some more action in the future to try to incorporate some of what we're doing here into the laws that apply to the retirement funds and other funds that are under control of the state.

528
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:31,273
[SPEAKER_24]: With that, I'm interested to hear from my fellow Councilors and I would move to approve for first reading.

529
01:00:34,035 --> 01:00:34,835
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, President Bears.

530
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:38,497
[SPEAKER_64]: First, I'll recognize our fellow councilors.

531
01:00:39,137 --> 01:00:40,558
[SPEAKER_64]: Then we will go to public comment.

532
01:00:41,678 --> 01:00:47,300
[SPEAKER_64]: After discussion amongst councilors is done, we'll hear public comment from both folks inside the room and on Zoom.

533
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,641
[SPEAKER_64]: I'll recognize Councilor Scarpelli first.

534
01:00:51,062 --> 01:00:52,602
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you, Vice President.

535
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:54,323
[SPEAKER_29]: Again, it's

536
01:00:55,722 --> 01:01:19,482
[SPEAKER_29]: To set the presentation of my share of this, my input at least, I had a great phone call with a good friend of mine before I came into the building and he wanted to express as a Palestinian resident of Medford, we had a great discussion and we realized sometimes it's easier to

537
01:01:21,443 --> 01:01:25,386
[SPEAKER_29]: have one side against another side, because that makes it the battle, right?

538
01:01:25,406 --> 01:01:26,327
[SPEAKER_29]: It makes it a fight.

539
01:01:27,067 --> 01:01:31,771
[SPEAKER_29]: And the idea of why George Scarpelli feels the way he is, many different levels.

540
01:01:32,131 --> 01:01:36,715
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilman Villes brought up some great points that we see eye to eye on, whether you want to believe it or not.

541
01:01:37,075 --> 01:01:43,020
[SPEAKER_29]: We also look at different questions that he brings upon to this evening that I don't disagree with him at all.

542
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:49,805
[SPEAKER_29]: But I think what's important for this council is to remember when you take your oath, you have to

543
01:01:51,321 --> 01:01:57,104
[SPEAKER_29]: make your decisions for what's best in this community and above and beyond what your personal feelings are.

544
01:01:57,524 --> 01:02:04,847
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think that from the beginning I've talked about the reason why Councilor Scarpelli has been against this ordinance is

545
01:02:05,625 --> 01:02:13,290
[SPEAKER_29]: because of the vagueness, the questions of its legalities, or what the impact will play for our community.

546
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:23,176
[SPEAKER_29]: And if I can, I'm going to read what the hard work that the city, the city administration has been putting together.

547
01:02:23,636 --> 01:02:25,557
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is a letter that was sent out to the council.

548
01:02:26,077 --> 01:02:28,359
[SPEAKER_29]: And it says dear President Bears and city council,

549
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:35,572
[SPEAKER_29]: I reviewed the divestment ordinance in the current red line version, which was made available on Friday, August 1st.

550
01:02:36,232 --> 01:02:46,458
[SPEAKER_29]: While there has not been sufficient time to conduct a full review, we would like to share with you the following initial comments, which are in addition to our below email of the July 15th.

551
01:02:46,498 --> 01:02:54,142
[SPEAKER_29]: In summary, in the ordinance current form, there are significant legal and policy issues with compliance with state law,

552
01:02:54,858 --> 01:03:19,740
[SPEAKER_29]: treasury's fiduciary responsibilities and significant implications that warrant further and diligent vetting with respect to impacts the city's municipal finances and a closed consultation with financial advisors of bond council and our legal counsel in dor so these are the the professionals in our field of of what we do

553
01:03:20,946 --> 01:03:49,588
[SPEAKER_29]: uh fiduciary here in this community and it's very important that we understand there are some points that need to be cleared before we can move forward with any sort of ordinance at this level and they make some key points one prudent investment act is to our knowledge there is no concrete information to whether the city has adopted the prudent investment act and legal recommends that this be confirmed given the language in the proposed ordinance and it would be premature to consider an ordinance prior to confirming

554
01:03:50,725 --> 01:03:53,866
[SPEAKER_29]: Two significant concerns with the city's financial advisor.

555
01:03:54,446 --> 01:03:58,668
[SPEAKER_29]: We request initial feedback from the city's financial advisor, Hilltop Securities.

556
01:03:59,188 --> 01:04:05,310
[SPEAKER_29]: On the original version, the ordinance that was presented to the council and they have advised us to the following.

557
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:09,591
[SPEAKER_29]: KPLR is in agreement with the initial legal issues raised by Hilltop Securities.

558
01:04:10,071 --> 01:04:14,833
[SPEAKER_29]: Further reviews is necessary given the financial advisor's initial feedback.

559
01:04:15,504 --> 01:04:23,366
[SPEAKER_29]: On two, I won't bore you with the ordinances and how they must comply with different laws and the concerns that the city has.

560
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:25,526
[SPEAKER_29]: But three, the bond rating call.

561
01:04:25,686 --> 01:04:34,809
[SPEAKER_29]: The call has just confirmed a mandatory bond rating call this month, which standard and pours for the school HVAC project.

562
01:04:35,169 --> 01:04:44,151
[SPEAKER_29]: The bond rating agencies always ask if there has been any change to the city's ordinance policies, et cetera, as it relates to financial matters.

563
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:44,791
[SPEAKER_29]: As such,

564
01:04:45,451 --> 01:04:54,539
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a poor time to have such a dramatic change in policy being considered for adoption relative to municipal finance in light of comments raised by Hilltop.

565
01:04:56,535 --> 01:04:58,136
[SPEAKER_29]: defined financial instruments.

566
01:04:58,397 --> 01:05:01,680
[SPEAKER_29]: The use of the word financial instruments as it presented is vague.

567
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:13,230
[SPEAKER_29]: It will need to be defined in consultation with the treasurer, financial director, legal counsel, bond counsel to ensure that this does not conflict with the city's legal and financial documents.

568
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:22,418
[SPEAKER_29]: Furthermore, I question whether the term financial instruments will be used to restrict the contracts that the city enters into with vendors.

569
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:26,667
[SPEAKER_29]: there would be a significant implication there as well.

570
01:05:26,867 --> 01:05:27,988
[SPEAKER_29]: That should be the case.

571
01:05:28,308 --> 01:05:35,811
[SPEAKER_29]: All the more reasons that the term should be defined after further diligent review by all necessary stakeholders.

572
01:05:35,992 --> 01:05:38,713
[SPEAKER_29]: Five, timeline on this ordinance and adoption.

573
01:05:39,732 --> 01:05:50,715
[SPEAKER_29]: It is my understanding that the city bond adopted divestment ordinance, not as broad as this one, as method is proposed to be broadest of the few that are out there.

574
01:05:51,055 --> 01:05:56,677
[SPEAKER_29]: And they did so in 2021 with a 2025 implementation date.

575
01:05:57,457 --> 01:06:00,378
[SPEAKER_29]: They allowed it four years to be able to be implemented this process.

576
01:06:01,217 --> 01:06:06,138
[SPEAKER_29]: The current proposal ordinance in Medford seeks this adoption implementation less than five months.

577
01:06:06,778 --> 01:06:20,582
[SPEAKER_29]: It is my understanding that the other communities had reasoned and well-vetted processes to adopt the narrower ordinances that is currently proposed given the significant legal and financial consideration and adoptions continues to feel rushed in Medford.

578
01:06:21,448 --> 01:06:22,968
[SPEAKER_29]: Six, the full legal review.

579
01:06:23,549 --> 01:06:46,315
[SPEAKER_29]: Given the significant changes currently proposed, legal, we need to conduct a full review for legalities and compliance with state law, including, but not limited to, general laws, section 44, 55B, as also raised the city's financial advisor, given the statutory requirements of the treasury relative the investments pursuant to statutory requirements.

580
01:06:47,215 --> 01:07:09,722
[SPEAKER_29]: Finally, based on meetings held on Friday between Commissioner of the Trust Fund Chairwoman Judy Beatrice, Council President Bears, and Treasurer-Collector Judy Johnson that our Chief of Staff listened in on, Chair Beatrice requested the following language be added, and I'm sure she'll share that later, so I won't repeat it now, and that is signed sincerely our Chief of Staff.

581
01:07:10,422 --> 01:07:10,842
[SPEAKER_29]: So again,

582
01:07:11,791 --> 01:07:24,078
[SPEAKER_29]: We've had a very difficult time in Medford in the last year, where a lot of process and policies have been implemented without true vetting, without the true input of our community.

583
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,579
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is just another factor.

584
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:38,025
[SPEAKER_29]: We have to remember, as elected officials, when we were sworn in, it's our fiduciary responsibilities to make sure that we are upholding what's best for the city of Medford.

585
01:07:38,982 --> 01:07:52,617
[SPEAKER_29]: and looking at these documents, looking at the response from our city administration and having questions legally from the legal team, our financial team and our bond council, I think it's enough that we should really slow things down.

586
01:07:53,472 --> 01:07:58,993
[SPEAKER_29]: and really try to vet this properly, because I know it's in theory.

587
01:07:59,013 --> 01:08:02,394
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't disagree with you, Council President.

588
01:08:02,874 --> 01:08:07,455
[SPEAKER_29]: I understand where you're going with this, but I also think, again, we're seeing what's happening with zoning.

589
01:08:07,795 --> 01:08:09,596
[SPEAKER_29]: We're seeing what's happening with our charter review.

590
01:08:09,936 --> 01:08:12,896
[SPEAKER_29]: We witnessed what happened with the override process.

591
01:08:13,277 --> 01:08:14,957
[SPEAKER_29]: It seems like everything is rushed.

592
01:08:15,437 --> 01:08:24,161
[SPEAKER_29]: And I think this is enough information that this council takes a second and realize that this is our responsibility not to rush into these with these factors that we know.

593
01:08:24,561 --> 01:08:27,122
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you, Mr. President, Madam Vice President.

594
01:08:30,863 --> 01:08:34,685
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go next to Councilor Lazzaro and then back to President Bears.

595
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:36,897
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

596
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:54,822
[SPEAKER_60]: I appreciate that this is a major request of the city administration, and I got that email also that was just read, and it would be a big project to take on.

597
01:08:55,422 --> 01:09:03,524
[SPEAKER_60]: And I think that that communication that we received expresses how challenging it may be

598
01:09:04,146 --> 01:09:11,529
[SPEAKER_60]: but I don't think that something being challenging necessarily means that it's not the right thing to do.

599
01:09:12,029 --> 01:09:19,292
[SPEAKER_60]: In the case of this, one of the things we can do as a city government is control the way at least a little bit that we invest our taxpayers' money.

600
01:09:20,873 --> 01:09:22,494
[SPEAKER_60]: This ordinance sprang from our community.

601
01:09:22,514 --> 01:09:30,177
[SPEAKER_60]: We were asked to, President Bears was asked to bring this forward by people in our community.

602
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:34,241
[SPEAKER_60]: And that's where it came from.

603
01:09:34,281 --> 01:09:35,543
[SPEAKER_60]: Our community requested this.

604
01:09:36,404 --> 01:09:37,986
[SPEAKER_60]: And it is really bold.

605
01:09:38,286 --> 01:09:41,470
[SPEAKER_60]: It would be the first time that a city in Massachusetts did it.

606
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:49,258
[SPEAKER_60]: And the way that our city government operates is not that every time there's an idea,

607
01:09:50,011 --> 01:09:55,215
[SPEAKER_60]: we all vote on it as an entire city, like a town meeting.

608
01:09:55,395 --> 01:09:58,697
[SPEAKER_60]: We don't have that sort of organization.

609
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:09,585
[SPEAKER_60]: What happens is our city representatives work together with the community, but we carry out what our community requests.

610
01:10:09,726 --> 01:10:17,811
[SPEAKER_60]: And in this case, to ignore the requests of our community and our own morality, I think is, to me, it's not an acceptable path.

611
01:10:20,211 --> 01:10:23,693
[SPEAKER_60]: I think this is a perfect moment for us to be bold.

612
01:10:24,294 --> 01:10:31,058
[SPEAKER_60]: And it can be a little bit scary sometimes, but I think that it is doable.

613
01:10:31,098 --> 01:10:36,762
[SPEAKER_60]: I think based on the people I've spoken with, that it is doable and it's necessary.

614
01:10:37,602 --> 01:10:49,850
[SPEAKER_60]: And also that, you know, people have been trying for a long time to get the attention of world leaders about things like climate change and things like for-profit prisons and weapons manufacturers and

615
01:10:50,577 --> 01:11:02,104
[SPEAKER_60]: countries that are acting with impunity all over the world, and people in those countries are actively resisting and protesting, and we don't always know about it.

616
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:11,089
[SPEAKER_60]: I have a friend that lives in one of these countries, and she told me about the constant protesting that we do not see.

617
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:15,852
[SPEAKER_60]: And every time we talk about a people,

618
01:11:17,058 --> 01:11:30,495
[SPEAKER_60]: entire group of people in another nation feels this way, we can think about maybe a large number of them are protesting in the streets every day against what their government is doing too.

619
01:11:32,918 --> 01:11:34,380
[SPEAKER_60]: I didn't even know about that until

620
01:11:35,898 --> 01:11:36,238
[SPEAKER_60]: Sunday.

621
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:50,246
[SPEAKER_60]: So I think it's incumbent upon us to carry out the things that our community asks for when we believe them to be right and good and true and financially prudent.

622
01:11:50,546 --> 01:11:53,567
[SPEAKER_60]: And I think this is an example of that.

623
01:11:54,008 --> 01:11:56,689
[SPEAKER_60]: So I really appreciate President Bears bring this forward.

624
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:59,310
[SPEAKER_60]: I appreciate the work that he's done with community members.

625
01:12:01,191 --> 01:12:04,674
[SPEAKER_60]: And I think we've had a lot of opportunities for public participation.

626
01:12:04,694 --> 01:12:07,797
[SPEAKER_60]: I think we'll have more tonight and that it doesn't have to end there.

627
01:12:07,997 --> 01:12:11,159
[SPEAKER_60]: And it'll be a robust discussion.

628
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:16,183
[SPEAKER_60]: And I think it's critical that we continue to have it.

629
01:12:16,704 --> 01:12:24,410
[SPEAKER_60]: I appreciate our community's willingness and capacity for engagement on this topic.

630
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:27,812
[SPEAKER_60]: And I feel grateful to be part of it.

631
01:12:28,253 --> 01:12:28,473
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

632
01:12:37,837 --> 01:12:38,938
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Councilor Rosario.

633
01:12:38,998 --> 01:12:40,079
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go back to President Bears.

634
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:42,841
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Chair Collins.

635
01:12:44,122 --> 01:12:47,444
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to address a few things.

636
01:12:48,845 --> 01:12:51,267
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Rosario is right that this comes from community.

637
01:12:52,088 --> 01:13:01,895
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the first things that I looked into and asked for with Councilor Morell five and a half years ago was what it would look like for our community.

638
01:13:02,622 --> 01:13:04,942
[SPEAKER_24]: to divest from fossil fuels.

639
01:13:05,623 --> 01:13:31,788
[SPEAKER_24]: And as we have seen efforts across the state, some more successful than others, certainly efforts nationally and internationally, I've heard from more residents about some of the egregious harms and industries that so many people are putting pressure on to change their behavior and to say that we're not going to be investing our public funds in.

640
01:13:33,045 --> 01:13:39,430
[SPEAKER_24]: So I've talked to a lot of residents over a lot of years, heard from a lot of residents over many years about this.

641
01:13:39,870 --> 01:14:00,686
[SPEAKER_24]: And when we saw the results of the last election, especially started to see within days, the stoking of hate, stoking of fear, stoking of violence, now being done in our name by our federal government, it became incredibly clear that we needed to fight back.

642
01:14:01,807 --> 01:14:05,410
[SPEAKER_24]: And so that's why I've worked for the last eight months on this ordinance.

643
01:14:06,591 --> 01:14:14,076
[SPEAKER_24]: I have had many discussions with Chief of Staff Nazarian, including last week, including this afternoon.

644
01:14:16,838 --> 01:14:21,602
[SPEAKER_24]: Some things that are concerns in the email today were not concerns in the conversation on Friday.

645
01:14:22,522 --> 01:14:23,183
[SPEAKER_24]: That's fine.

646
01:14:26,505 --> 01:14:29,628
[SPEAKER_24]: But I share my colleague Councilor Scarpelli's frustration

647
01:14:30,807 --> 01:14:39,975
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know, I think something I've been trying to do lately is think about my approach.

648
01:14:42,017 --> 01:14:53,668
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know, I don't agree with everything Councilor Scarpelli says, but a lot of the things that were read in the email that he just read are questions that we had four months ago.

649
01:14:54,852 --> 01:15:12,562
[SPEAKER_24]: They are issues that I have worked diligently in multiple meetings with multiple entities in the city to get to a clear definition to help them understand, you know, and quite frankly, many of the things in the email are maybe yes, maybe no, we don't know.

650
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:15,384
[SPEAKER_24]: And I understand that.

651
01:15:16,715 --> 01:15:28,250
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, they cite a mass general law that right in section 2699 says right here, subject to the provisions of general law, chapter 44, section 54 and 55 and the prudent investor act, right?

652
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:31,695
[SPEAKER_24]: That's because legal already reviewed it once and I incorporated their changes.

653
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:38,202
[SPEAKER_24]: We have an entire methodology in here that I discussed with the retirement system.

654
01:15:38,582 --> 01:15:40,483
[SPEAKER_24]: I spoke with city staff for an hour.

655
01:15:40,583 --> 01:15:42,884
[SPEAKER_24]: I spoke with folks for another hour last week.

656
01:15:43,324 --> 01:15:47,486
[SPEAKER_24]: I've brought up on the phone, I've shared to make it very clear how to implement this.

657
01:15:48,246 --> 01:16:01,272
[SPEAKER_24]: And to be honest, and I hope that people can feel some sort of clarity from this, from the analysis so far, it doesn't seem like much of our city funds are invested in any of these things.

658
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,312
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that's a good thing.

659
01:16:05,753 --> 01:16:10,575
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think the reality that they should never be invested in the future is an important piece of this too.

660
01:16:12,296 --> 01:16:31,225
[SPEAKER_24]: When we talk about how does it get implemented, and these are concerns, when I hear the same concerns for four months over four calls, over four months, over many calls, over multiple meetings, and they've remained maybe, maybe not concerns, and the answers aren't anywhere, and we never receive a document that actually says,

661
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:35,215
[SPEAKER_24]: here's the research we've done and here are the changes we want you to make.

662
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:42,319
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's really hard to consider those concerns in any sort of real and substantive way.

663
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:51,986
[SPEAKER_24]: The way I left it with the chief of staff this afternoon was, this is a first reading, it'll be advertised, it'll come back for a third reading, send us a memo,

664
01:16:53,145 --> 01:17:04,758
[SPEAKER_24]: With your legal suggestions, send us a memo with your policy suggestions, make sure they're two different memos because too often we get legal suggestions that are actually policy suggestions and we'll consider them.

665
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,703
[SPEAKER_24]: And I said this a month ago in the end of June.

666
01:17:11,479 --> 01:17:14,720
[SPEAKER_24]: Part of moving forward is to set the clock running.

667
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:21,042
[SPEAKER_24]: If these are real concerns, and we need to do the review, then we need to do it in a timely way.

668
01:17:21,462 --> 01:17:24,964
[SPEAKER_24]: And when the goalpost keeps getting moved.

669
01:17:26,284 --> 01:17:33,887
[SPEAKER_24]: And the same concerns keep getting brought up, or we make some corrections and then they're not quite the right corrections and we need another one set of corrections.

670
01:17:35,147 --> 01:17:48,592
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's imperative that we advance the process forward so that the people who are raising those concerns give us them in a clear and coherent way that we can consider and then look at the ordinance language specifically.

671
01:17:49,712 --> 01:17:52,833
[SPEAKER_24]: From my conversations, we addressed a lot of stuff here.

672
01:17:52,853 --> 01:17:55,474
[SPEAKER_24]: The email can say what it wants.

673
01:17:55,514 --> 01:17:57,355
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not talking about vendor contracts.

674
01:17:57,395 --> 01:18:02,196
[SPEAKER_24]: We're talking about the investments of city funds in stocks and securities.

675
01:18:02,216 --> 01:18:03,177
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what we're talking about.

676
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:14,394
[SPEAKER_24]: There's an entire methodology in here that makes it very plain and clear how to look at potential investments to address this.

677
01:18:16,335 --> 01:18:23,080
[SPEAKER_24]: And for me, I think that the due diligence and the work done to this point is sufficient.

678
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:25,722
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's why I made my motion to approve for first reading.

679
01:18:26,602 --> 01:18:30,365
[SPEAKER_24]: And I invite the administration to concretely

680
01:18:31,445 --> 01:18:40,711
[SPEAKER_24]: frame its concerns with specific suggestions for ways that we could change language, if necessary, and consider this council could consider an advance of third reading.

681
01:18:40,972 --> 01:18:42,273
[SPEAKER_24]: So I appreciate it.

682
01:18:42,313 --> 01:18:46,616
[SPEAKER_24]: And yeah, I understand my fellow councillors concerns.

683
01:18:49,538 --> 01:18:50,939
[SPEAKER_24]: It can be very difficult.

684
01:18:51,879 --> 01:18:55,582
[SPEAKER_24]: The relationship between this council and the city administration has been difficult at many turns.

685
01:18:56,551 --> 01:19:02,212
[SPEAKER_24]: I would say that I feel we've made a very coherent and honest effort to try to have a collaborative relationship.

686
01:19:03,193 --> 01:19:05,973
[SPEAKER_24]: And it hasn't been easy.

687
01:19:05,993 --> 01:19:11,094
[SPEAKER_24]: And it will continue, I expect to not be easy, but we'll continue to try.

688
01:19:11,114 --> 01:19:11,895
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

689
01:19:20,257 --> 01:19:21,137
[SPEAKER_69]: Thank you, President Bears.

690
01:19:24,572 --> 01:19:25,332
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, President Bears.

691
01:19:26,073 --> 01:19:34,437
[SPEAKER_64]: I'm sure we'll hear from more Councilors and also members of the public tonight that some people in the audience will feel the desire to respond to one way or the other.

692
01:19:34,457 --> 01:19:36,379
[SPEAKER_64]: I suspect that we'll want to hear from a lot of people.

693
01:19:36,459 --> 01:19:42,622
[SPEAKER_64]: So I ask folks to please keep your responses short so that we can make sure we hear from everybody in a timely manner.

694
01:19:43,502 --> 01:19:45,984
[SPEAKER_64]: I like applauding as next is as much as the, what was that?

695
01:19:47,185 --> 01:19:47,805
[SPEAKER_64]: Oh, Justin.

696
01:19:50,746 --> 01:19:51,587
[SPEAKER_64]: I knew something was missing.

697
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:56,184
[SPEAKER_37]: Are you calling on me?

698
01:19:56,704 --> 01:20:00,026
[SPEAKER_64]: All that to say, please keep your applause short or I'll ask people to stop applauding.

699
01:20:01,346 --> 01:20:03,247
[SPEAKER_64]: I'll be recognizing Councilor Tseng.

700
01:20:03,267 --> 01:20:03,567
[SPEAKER_64]: Go ahead.

701
01:20:04,988 --> 01:20:07,469
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, President, Vice President Collins.

702
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:18,653
[SPEAKER_37]: I just wanted to state where I am at quickly, because I think our constituents deserve to hear where my brain's at.

703
01:20:20,778 --> 01:20:23,840
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm here to listen to the community discussion tonight.

704
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:34,007
[SPEAKER_37]: I know we've had two very rich meetings of two meetings of very rich discussions, and people who feel, you know, very strongly on either side about this.

705
01:20:36,743 --> 01:20:43,166
[SPEAKER_37]: But that's all to say that I do believe that our investments are an expression of our values.

706
01:20:44,107 --> 01:20:48,989
[SPEAKER_37]: And our city and our residents should be comfortable with the investments that we make.

707
01:20:50,050 --> 01:21:00,935
[SPEAKER_37]: And we should be able to say no when we are concerned about the investments that we make.

708
01:21:02,456 --> 01:21:03,897
[SPEAKER_37]: I think about this like,

709
01:21:05,049 --> 01:21:08,811
[SPEAKER_37]: Like if we were a family, and we are a family, we're a Medford family.

710
01:21:10,692 --> 01:21:13,333
[SPEAKER_37]: As a family, you wouldn't shop at a business that you don't want to support.

711
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:21,737
[SPEAKER_37]: And you wouldn't invest in a team or a project that you're morally opposed to.

712
01:21:22,518 --> 01:21:23,979
[SPEAKER_37]: As a business, you wouldn't do that either.

713
01:21:23,999 --> 01:21:30,302
[SPEAKER_37]: I understand a lot of the community concerns that have been raised.

714
01:21:31,572 --> 01:21:37,776
[SPEAKER_37]: And I'm really grateful that President Bears has done the hard work of taking those concerns on board.

715
01:21:39,096 --> 01:21:54,966
[SPEAKER_37]: It's true, anti-Semitism is a real problem, but as many residents, Jewish and non-Jewish, have raised in previous meetings, we shouldn't conflate the issues, and conflating the issues actually can risk inflaming tensions even more.

716
01:21:56,437 --> 01:22:06,124
[SPEAKER_37]: In these heated moments, I think we should tune out the hullabaloo, tune out the fuss, and look at the actual question that lies at the heart of the ordinance itself.

717
01:22:07,164 --> 01:22:24,096
[SPEAKER_37]: And in reading the text of this ordinance, the question that ultimately remains is whether or not we choose to invest in companies that are endangering our future and our children's future, and those who seriously violate human rights and international humanitarian law.

718
01:22:25,394 --> 01:22:41,761
[SPEAKER_37]: As someone whose family grew up in a dictatorship, as someone whose family members were disappeared, as someone who has close family and friends living in countries that are being threatened or who are actively under attack from countries that are severe violators of human rights,

719
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:57,521
[SPEAKER_37]: As someone whose job right now it is to work on human rights cases in many of these countries, to protect dissidents and ethnic minorities, and as someone whose future is at risk because of our ever-warming planet, I think I know how I would answer that question.

720
01:22:59,102 --> 01:23:07,628
[SPEAKER_37]: That being said, I will respect all the points that are raised by this community tonight, and I look forward to the discussion.

721
01:23:12,570 --> 01:23:13,773
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

722
01:23:13,793 --> 01:23:20,527
[SPEAKER_64]: Are there any other councillors who would like to discuss the matter further at this time before public comment?

723
01:23:22,667 --> 01:23:26,309
[SPEAKER_64]: Seeing none, I know there are a lot of people in the audience who would like to speak on this matter.

724
01:23:26,829 --> 01:23:30,531
[SPEAKER_64]: We will accept public comment both here at the podium and on Zoom.

725
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:35,754
[SPEAKER_64]: If you'd like to speak in person, please line up in a queue behind the podium.

726
01:23:35,774 --> 01:23:38,195
[SPEAKER_64]: I will alternate between in-person and on Zoom.

727
01:23:38,715 --> 01:23:41,837
[SPEAKER_64]: I will ask everybody to give their name and their address for the record.

728
01:23:42,537 --> 01:23:43,658
[SPEAKER_64]: Sorry, let me turn myself up here.

729
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:50,361
[SPEAKER_64]: I will ask everybody to give their name and address for the record, and everybody will have exactly three minutes.

730
01:23:50,421 --> 01:23:56,023
[SPEAKER_64]: We have a lot of people who want to talk tonight, so I will be holding us to that strict limit to make sure that we hear from everybody.

731
01:24:00,585 --> 01:24:01,786
[SPEAKER_64]: We will begin at the podium.

732
01:24:01,966 --> 01:24:03,207
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

733
01:24:03,247 --> 01:24:03,847
[SPEAKER_64]: You have three minutes.

734
01:24:05,702 --> 01:24:12,288
[SPEAKER_16]: And bears honorable Vice President Collins, honorable Councilors and Mr. Clerk, I'm Dave Sherman from Rosemary Way.

735
01:24:12,648 --> 01:24:18,874
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been a volunteer in the Middle East on multiple missions, including packaging medical supplies to be sent into Gaza.

736
01:24:19,334 --> 01:24:24,759
[SPEAKER_16]: I've also just started a major fundraising campaign to build bomb shelters in majority Arab cities in Israel.

737
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:31,906
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope you'll look at the so-called values aligned local investment ordinance or value ordinance with a truly open mind.

738
01:24:32,466 --> 01:24:38,091
[SPEAKER_16]: it would forbid the city from investing in entities that contribute to, among other evils, severe human rights violations.

739
01:24:38,732 --> 01:24:52,684
[SPEAKER_16]: In the current political environment of libelous accusations like those flung mindlessly against Israel, it would be easy to interpret the proposal as forbidding investment in that democratic state, even though it's craftily not mentioned by name.

740
01:24:53,465 --> 01:24:58,372
[SPEAKER_16]: Currently in a war of self-defense that she never wanted was imposed upon her by Iran controlled terrorists.

741
01:24:58,973 --> 01:25:09,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Self-declared pro-Palestinians, usually more accurately described as pro-terrorist, are likely to testify in favor of the proposal, a playbook including old tired claims of Jewish or Holocaust survivor.

742
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:26,908
[SPEAKER_16]: ancestry that they pull out of their tush pockets for the purpose, and falsely and even slanderously connect the proposal to Israel, creating a legislative history that would make the law seem aimed at the only country in the Middle East that actually has equal rights for women and for the LGBTQIA plus population.

743
01:25:27,888 --> 01:25:38,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Further evidence that Valley is unjustly intended against the usual scapegoat, Israel, is that Valley requires the use of the corporation MSCI's ESG methodology as a source.

744
01:25:38,656 --> 01:25:41,378
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, the MSCI's guidelines are suspected best.

745
01:25:41,918 --> 01:25:49,023
[SPEAKER_16]: They not only use source materials from groups like Amnesty International, which broadened the definition of genocide just so it could include Israel.

746
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,463
[SPEAKER_16]: excuse me, but under the, I'm sorry, but under the prevailing press bias, you probably heard that here first.

747
01:25:56,024 --> 01:26:10,973
[SPEAKER_16]: They not only use that false material, they also use as a source the Palestine Chronicle, among whose journalists was an actual Hamas terrorist captor who was holding three Israeli hostages until Israel rescued them in a heroic raid last summer.

748
01:26:11,453 --> 01:26:19,538
[SPEAKER_16]: So in approving this resolution, in approving this ordinance, you would be literally putting the city's investment policy into the hands of terrorists.

749
01:26:21,003 --> 01:26:27,208
[SPEAKER_16]: If Pass Valley would directly threaten the city in time of need, I'm also a disaster planner and responder.

750
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:37,295
[SPEAKER_16]: And we know now from New York Times report yesterday that FEMA is withholding disaster relief funds from jurisdictions engaged in anti-Israel boycotts.

751
01:26:37,555 --> 01:26:40,958
[SPEAKER_16]: You and others may argue about the justice of such a policy, but it's there.

752
01:26:41,718 --> 01:26:50,780
[SPEAKER_16]: Pass this resolution, pass this ordinance, and it's quite possible that in future disasters, the amount of Stafford Act funds that Medford will get will be zero, right when it's most needed.

753
01:26:51,580 --> 01:27:02,163
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, there are values in the proposal that the city may want to endorse and vote with its dollars, such as limiting fossil fuels and targeting real human rights violators, such as China, with over a billion people under its thumb.

754
01:27:02,183 --> 01:27:05,604
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a by far larger offender of human rights than Israel.

755
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:09,245
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's immune from international criticism because it's not governed by Jews.

756
01:27:10,145 --> 01:27:10,906
[SPEAKER_64]: At the same time.

757
01:27:10,926 --> 01:27:11,266
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

758
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:11,987
[SPEAKER_64]: Am I out of time?

759
01:27:12,267 --> 01:27:12,728
[SPEAKER_64]: You're out of time.

760
01:27:12,748 --> 01:27:13,829
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

761
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,155
[SPEAKER_64]: We will go next to Zoom.

762
01:27:21,937 --> 01:27:24,399
[SPEAKER_64]: I'm going to ask Anne to unmute.

763
01:27:24,459 --> 01:27:26,401
[SPEAKER_64]: Please state your name and address for the record, please.

764
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:27,342
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

765
01:27:30,925 --> 01:27:32,647
[SPEAKER_74]: Hi, my name is Maren Kastner.

766
01:27:35,055 --> 01:27:39,978
[SPEAKER_74]: I don't know if you can see me, but my name is Ann Kastner-Williams and I live at 79 Caven Street.

767
01:27:40,338 --> 01:27:42,399
[SPEAKER_74]: Thank you to the City Council for hearing this.

768
01:27:42,539 --> 01:27:45,080
[SPEAKER_74]: I support the ordinance and urge you all to pass it.

769
01:27:45,681 --> 01:27:49,843
[SPEAKER_74]: I am speaking as a social worker and a therapist for children and adults.

770
01:27:50,483 --> 01:27:59,273
[SPEAKER_74]: My training and direct experience as a social worker have taught me that each person's well-being is directly shaped by their environment and the systems within it.

771
01:27:59,754 --> 01:28:08,764
[SPEAKER_74]: And we currently live in a system in which investing in destructive, anti-human companies is viewed as business as usual, and we need to change that.

772
01:28:09,465 --> 01:28:24,183
[SPEAKER_74]: I want so badly to be able to look into the eyes of my bright and curious child clients who are working so hard to manage their very big feelings and know that my tax dollars are not supporting the fossil fuel companies threatening their futures.

773
01:28:24,884 --> 01:28:34,349
[SPEAKER_74]: A 2023 meta-analysis showed that abnormal heat events are associated with an increase in suicides and mental health hospitalizations.

774
01:28:34,889 --> 01:28:50,137
[SPEAKER_74]: And I want to work alongside my courageous clients struggling with suicidality and know that my tax dollars aren't supporting the businesses responsible for global emissions that have caused these relentless heat waves that we've all been experiencing.

775
01:28:51,017 --> 01:29:05,954
[SPEAKER_74]: I want to help my clients with brown skin process and heal from their traumas and know that my tax dollars are not funding the private detention centers facilitating ISIS illegal and racist kidnappings that cause them daily fear.

776
01:29:06,634 --> 01:29:08,737
[SPEAKER_74]: Because how can you improve anxiety?

777
01:29:09,157 --> 01:29:14,100
[SPEAKER_74]: when you face the threat each day of being stolen from your family in broad daylight by ICE?

778
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:30,329
[SPEAKER_74]: How are you supposed to heal from PTSD as you watch a genocide and children with missing limbs and parents burying their children and starvation of a massive group of people live-streamed on your phone each day?

779
01:29:30,349 --> 01:29:37,853
[SPEAKER_74]: And how can I carry on the facade of helping people heal when we live in a profoundly sick society?

780
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:42,897
[SPEAKER_74]: that prioritizes profit over the dignity, safety and humanity of our residents.

781
01:29:43,637 --> 01:29:55,627
[SPEAKER_74]: This divestment ordinance is a chance for Medford to lead the state in aligning our economic investments with our stated values and to show that we actually don't need to accept business as usual.

782
01:29:55,647 --> 01:29:59,229
[SPEAKER_74]: I thank the council for considering passing the divestment ordinance.

783
01:29:59,550 --> 01:29:59,830
[SPEAKER_74]: Thank you.

784
01:30:04,965 --> 01:30:05,886
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

785
01:30:06,446 --> 01:30:07,668
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go next to the podium.

786
01:30:07,848 --> 01:30:09,189
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

787
01:30:09,229 --> 01:30:09,990
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

788
01:30:11,451 --> 01:30:12,952
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you for letting me speak.

789
01:30:13,093 --> 01:30:14,154
[SPEAKER_42]: I hope you can hear me.

790
01:30:15,315 --> 01:30:17,157
[SPEAKER_42]: My name is Claire Sheridan.

791
01:30:17,357 --> 01:30:37,939
[SPEAKER_42]: I live at 190 High Street in Medford, and I fully support the proposed ordinance to end the city's investments in fossil fuels, weapons manufacturers, private prisons, and corporations that contribute to human rights violations and crimes against humanity.

792
01:30:39,376 --> 01:30:43,259
[SPEAKER_42]: The city's investment portfolio will not suffer.

793
01:30:43,740 --> 01:30:47,723
[SPEAKER_42]: There are hundreds of alternative strategies to choose from.

794
01:30:48,283 --> 01:30:59,072
[SPEAKER_42]: If my personal financial portfolio can be modified to reflect these choices, then our treasurer's investment strategies can do the same.

795
01:31:00,433 --> 01:31:08,720
[SPEAKER_42]: We know that many Medford residents have been picked up by ICE and sent to privately owned detention centers.

796
01:31:10,021 --> 01:31:25,730
[SPEAKER_42]: We see the effects of rampant use of fossil fuels as our towns are flooded, our air quality is compromised, and rising temperatures affect our well-being and my electricity bill.

797
01:31:26,991 --> 01:31:33,755
[SPEAKER_42]: And we see on our screens every day the effect of greedy weapons manufacturers

798
01:31:34,824 --> 01:31:43,227
[SPEAKER_42]: who earned billions bombing and destroying innocent civilian populations in Gaza and elsewhere.

799
01:31:44,027 --> 01:31:45,848
[SPEAKER_42]: And the West Bank is next.

800
01:31:47,128 --> 01:31:53,811
[SPEAKER_42]: As an Irish American, I was raised on the effects of famine on my ancestors.

801
01:31:54,985 --> 01:32:04,449
[SPEAKER_42]: a famine that was not alleviated because the British wanted to clear the land and force immigration to the Americans.

802
01:32:05,309 --> 01:32:07,110
[SPEAKER_42]: Do you see any similarities?

803
01:32:08,551 --> 01:32:18,015
[SPEAKER_42]: At 83 years of age, I am sick and tired of my tax money going to these immoral companies and manufacturers

804
01:32:19,172 --> 01:32:30,035
[SPEAKER_42]: who aid and abet not only the killing of innocent citizens in faraway lands, but who compromise the lives of the Medford citizens.

805
01:32:31,415 --> 01:32:35,896
[SPEAKER_42]: For any councilor sitting on the fence, do the right thing.

806
01:32:36,756 --> 01:32:40,677
[SPEAKER_42]: Stand up for humanity here and abroad.

807
01:32:41,577 --> 01:32:44,198
[SPEAKER_42]: And I vote in every election.

808
01:32:54,538 --> 01:32:55,639
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to Zoom.

809
01:32:55,659 --> 01:32:57,440
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to Zoom.

810
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,621
[SPEAKER_64]: Renee, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

811
01:32:59,681 --> 01:33:01,382
[SPEAKER_64]: Please give your name and address for the record.

812
01:33:01,402 --> 01:33:02,243
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

813
01:33:05,284 --> 01:33:05,725
[SPEAKER_71]: Hello.

814
01:33:06,385 --> 01:33:09,567
[SPEAKER_71]: Thank you, Council, for considering this ordinance.

815
01:33:10,007 --> 01:33:15,190
[SPEAKER_71]: My name is Renee Corgood, and I live at 25 Brooks Park in apartment 15.

816
01:33:16,051 --> 01:33:18,212
[SPEAKER_71]: I am fully in support of this ordinance.

817
01:33:19,567 --> 01:33:26,030
[SPEAKER_71]: And I appreciate the Council for listening to the community for the support of this incredibly important measure.

818
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:34,175
[SPEAKER_71]: I work as a librarian in a local community, and I've been a resident of Bedford for three years now, a town I've come to love quite a lot.

819
01:33:35,596 --> 01:33:39,978
[SPEAKER_71]: And I love that when I come to Medford, I get to enjoy our beautiful green space.

820
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:44,481
[SPEAKER_71]: I love that when I work with the children I see at the library, that they have spaces to go.

821
01:33:44,501 --> 01:34:01,653
[SPEAKER_71]: And I am dismayed when I think about the hundreds of millions of tax dollars that go to companies like Lockheed Martin and that go to companies that are destroying the beautiful green space that we have and the communities my kids are part of.

822
01:34:02,453 --> 01:34:22,593
[SPEAKER_71]: I think about my kids' parents who are being snatched off the street by ICE, who are being left to fend for themselves with family members, and that my tax dollars are supporting those private prisons being used to have these people face just incredible amounts of

823
01:34:24,711 --> 01:34:25,071
[SPEAKER_71]: harm.

824
01:34:25,872 --> 01:34:47,750
[SPEAKER_71]: I believe in the fiduciary responsibility to building a community that lasts, to building a community that is strong and that matches the values that we have supported in the past, that match the action plan our city has on climate change, and that match the resolution we passed in support of a ceasefire in Gaza.

825
01:34:47,951 --> 01:34:48,891
[SPEAKER_71]: And for that reason, the

826
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:58,289
[SPEAKER_71]: Divestment ordinance supports not only my values, but the values that I know our city has based on the actions that we've taken in the past.

827
01:34:58,809 --> 01:35:11,335
[SPEAKER_71]: The city should invest our tax dollars sustainably, and I believe that my tax dollars should not go to companies who knowingly contribute to human rights violations and private prisons.

828
01:35:11,975 --> 01:35:16,338
[SPEAKER_71]: Thank you for considering this ordinance, and I would again like to state my strong support of passing it.

829
01:35:16,618 --> 01:35:16,898
[SPEAKER_71]: Thank you.

830
01:35:20,963 --> 01:35:21,643
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Renee.

831
01:35:22,524 --> 01:35:23,885
[SPEAKER_64]: We will go back to the podium.

832
01:35:23,905 --> 01:35:25,186
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

833
01:35:25,206 --> 01:35:25,846
[SPEAKER_64]: You have three minutes.

834
01:35:29,308 --> 01:35:30,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, my name's Ilana.

835
01:35:31,349 --> 01:35:33,891
[SPEAKER_12]: I live in 60 Ashland Street.

836
01:35:34,711 --> 01:35:43,817
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here today to voice strong opposition to the so-called values-aligned local investments ordinance.

837
01:35:44,037 --> 01:35:46,839
[SPEAKER_12]: On the surface, this ordinance may sound noble,

838
01:35:48,104 --> 01:35:50,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Who wouldn't want ethical investments?

839
01:35:50,488 --> 01:36:00,666
[SPEAKER_12]: But dig deeper and you'll see it's a vague politicized attempt to weaponize city finances to push a narrow ideological agenda.

840
01:36:01,783 --> 01:36:14,546
[SPEAKER_12]: By banning investments in companies tied to fossil fuels or undefined non-peacetime industries, the ordinance severely limits Medford's financial flexibility.

841
01:36:14,946 --> 01:36:17,587
[SPEAKER_12]: It puts politics ahead of fiscal responsibility.

842
01:36:18,287 --> 01:36:24,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Our treasury should be guided by sound returns and security for taxpayers, not activist checklists.

843
01:36:25,309 --> 01:36:33,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Moreover, this type of ordinance is often used to target companies doing business with Israel under the guise of values.

844
01:36:35,012 --> 01:36:44,655
[SPEAKER_12]: MSCI uses Who Profits, UN Human Rights Council, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, amongst others as sources.

845
01:36:45,395 --> 01:36:48,216
[SPEAKER_12]: All hold extreme biases against Israel.

846
01:36:48,856 --> 01:36:50,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Similar language has been

847
01:36:51,317 --> 01:36:59,459
[SPEAKER_12]: adopted elsewhere to support discriminatory boycotts that isolate the only democracy in the Middle East, also known as BDS.

848
01:37:00,619 --> 01:37:02,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford should not follow that path.

849
01:37:03,139 --> 01:37:06,140
[SPEAKER_12]: This ordinance also has the potential to divide our community.

850
01:37:06,460 --> 01:37:14,502
[SPEAKER_12]: By setting specific values as a benchmark for investment, we may alienate certain groups who feel their views are not represented.

851
01:37:15,082 --> 01:37:19,683
[SPEAKER_12]: It's crucial that our policies encourage inclusivity and dialogue rather than division.

852
01:37:20,223 --> 01:37:21,404
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a slippery slope.

853
01:37:21,844 --> 01:37:24,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Once we politicize city investments, what's next?

854
01:37:24,806 --> 01:37:28,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Banning pension investments in tech companies, banks, defense contractors?

855
01:37:28,988 --> 01:37:30,889
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll never agree on every political issue.

856
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:37,293
[SPEAKER_12]: But we should all agree that taxpayer dollars deserve neutrality and prudence, not performative politics.

857
01:37:38,053 --> 01:37:39,814
[SPEAKER_12]: I urge you to reject this ordinance.

858
01:37:40,095 --> 01:37:49,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Keep Medford's finances free from ideological manipulation and focus on what truly matters, fiscal stability and services to our community.

859
01:37:55,946 --> 01:37:56,827
[SPEAKER_69]: Thank you for your comments.

860
01:37:58,128 --> 01:38:05,374
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

861
01:38:05,394 --> 01:38:05,654
[SPEAKER_64]: 1-1-2-1.

862
01:38:22,168 --> 01:38:24,950
[SPEAKER_64]: And that's the only outburst from the audience that I will tolerate tonight.

863
01:38:25,693 --> 01:38:26,293
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Claire.

864
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:29,496
[SPEAKER_64]: We will go back to Zoom.

865
01:38:30,376 --> 01:38:32,178
[SPEAKER_64]: Dennis, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

866
01:38:32,218 --> 01:38:33,999
[SPEAKER_64]: Please state your name and address for the record.

867
01:38:34,039 --> 01:38:35,020
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

868
01:38:38,282 --> 01:38:38,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

869
01:38:39,082 --> 01:38:43,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis Dettling Kalthofer, 120 North Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

870
01:38:45,207 --> 01:38:52,572
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've read this ordinance a couple of times, a few times, and it seems very clear to me

871
01:38:55,089 --> 01:39:03,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I strongly support it, given the climate changes we're already experiencing.

872
01:39:03,314 --> 01:39:12,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know we have the Canadian wildfires that have made it almost impossible to sleep at night sometimes because of the smell of smoke.

873
01:39:13,922 --> 01:39:19,005
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people who live in Asheville, North Carolina, who are affected by storms.

874
01:39:20,066 --> 01:39:22,448
[SPEAKER_02]: And also given the war industries

875
01:39:23,979 --> 01:39:37,569
[SPEAKER_02]: how they're used, not just the weapons are being used to further the political objectives of our current government.

876
01:39:37,649 --> 01:39:50,158
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to get into the specifics of that, because they're also being used for diverting funds, where we really need the funds for domestic issues.

877
01:39:50,218 --> 01:39:51,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have no

878
01:39:52,836 --> 01:39:57,099
[SPEAKER_02]: problems with divesting from war industry in general.

879
01:39:59,860 --> 01:40:07,825
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is that I think given the current state of the country, we're not rushing things.

880
01:40:07,905 --> 01:40:18,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I think an ordinance like this, the sooner it takes place, the better, even if it means setting a precedent.

881
01:40:19,272 --> 01:40:19,973
[SPEAKER_02]: And given things

882
01:40:21,057 --> 01:40:23,079
[SPEAKER_02]: really spinning out of control in this country.

883
01:40:25,221 --> 01:40:40,295
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I want to mention, because I know this topic of Israel and Gaza comes up so much in this discussion, and I don't believe that this ordinance targets this specifically.

884
01:40:41,315 --> 01:40:44,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, first of all, I'm Jewish, and

885
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:48,702
[SPEAKER_02]: but I do not support what Israel is doing.

886
01:40:48,922 --> 01:40:52,785
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that has to be separated.

887
01:40:53,565 --> 01:41:03,912
[SPEAKER_02]: This is conflated, this whole business of conflating anti-Semitism with people who oppose Israel's policies.

888
01:41:04,732 --> 01:41:06,553
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not what the ordinance is about.

889
01:41:06,793 --> 01:41:09,555
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something, if that is part, if there are

890
01:41:12,090 --> 01:41:25,735
[SPEAKER_02]: investments in Israel or in industries that involve Israel, that's up to international bodies to decide.

891
01:41:26,456 --> 01:41:31,918
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not about whether we favor Israel or don't favor Israel.

892
01:41:33,759 --> 01:41:38,100
[SPEAKER_02]: What my question is, is why does the city have to invest funds at all?

893
01:41:39,061 --> 01:41:39,841
[SPEAKER_64]: Dennis, that's time.

894
01:41:42,368 --> 01:41:43,149
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

895
01:41:50,478 --> 01:41:51,439
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to the podium.

896
01:41:51,459 --> 01:41:52,641
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

897
01:41:52,681 --> 01:41:53,502
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

898
01:41:54,308 --> 01:41:56,149
[SPEAKER_50]: Patrick Clark in 50 Princeton Street.

899
01:41:57,389 --> 01:42:00,291
[SPEAKER_50]: And I'm going to focus on the fossil fuel aspect of this.

900
01:42:01,091 --> 01:42:14,978
[SPEAKER_50]: And I wanted to say that if the topic is trying to reduce pollution, reduce waste, reduce litter, reduce regime change operations in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere,

901
01:42:16,206 --> 01:42:19,729
[SPEAKER_50]: I tend to support that if it's a substantive effort.

902
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:21,932
[SPEAKER_50]: I do not see this as a substantive effort.

903
01:42:22,733 --> 01:42:26,176
[SPEAKER_50]: I see this more as signaling.

904
01:42:26,777 --> 01:42:32,623
[SPEAKER_50]: And I wanted to focus on, so the fossil fuel industry is actually three industries.

905
01:42:32,983 --> 01:42:37,889
[SPEAKER_50]: There's fossil fuels, there's chemicals and plastics derived from fossil fuels.

906
01:42:38,489 --> 01:42:48,514
[SPEAKER_50]: And so a lot of people think if you take on the fossil fuel companies, you're just taking on things like hummers and smokestacks and the plastic we see on the side of the road.

907
01:42:48,995 --> 01:42:58,160
[SPEAKER_50]: I think that's noble, but I just wanted to bring to the attention of the council and the people in the chamber other things that are made from fossil fuels and its byproducts.

908
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:05,723
[SPEAKER_50]: Audio and video equipment, including microphones, cameras, and digital displays for podcasts, e-learning, and remote access.

909
01:43:06,264 --> 01:43:08,805
[SPEAKER_50]: The grip tape and seat on your bicycle handlebars.

910
01:43:09,045 --> 01:43:10,666
[SPEAKER_50]: The paint that forms bike lanes.

911
01:43:10,786 --> 01:43:14,808
[SPEAKER_50]: The asphalt that forms the lanes themselves, or the equipment to mine the gravel.

912
01:43:15,408 --> 01:43:17,670
[SPEAKER_50]: Dyes and ink for flags and hair.

913
01:43:18,130 --> 01:43:19,170
[SPEAKER_50]: Paints for artists.

914
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:21,672
[SPEAKER_50]: Stickers and marketing materials for causes.

915
01:43:22,152 --> 01:43:24,213
[SPEAKER_50]: Clothing, glasses, frames, and lenses.

916
01:43:24,653 --> 01:43:47,585
[SPEAKER_50]: the toys your kids and dogs play with, your cat's house, the safety equipment for work crews, the circuit board components and casings within your electronics, the insulation on the wiring that charges your electric vehicle and keeps your data and social media on a server-based cloud, medical equipment including the masks, testing kits, and ventilator components during the pandemic,

917
01:43:48,285 --> 01:44:05,980
[SPEAKER_50]: Hygienic cleaning chemicals and deployment systems, laboratory test equipment for scientific research, sex toys, contraceptives, and lubricants, sealants and insulation to make homes and buildings more energy efficient, refrigerants, desiccants, preservatives, and packages for food transportation,

918
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:19,849
[SPEAKER_50]: paneling, gasketing, and control panels for cars and public transport, components, chemicals, and fuels for wind turbines and solar panels, along with their transportation, assembly, and maintenance, fireproof battery housings, and chemicals.

919
01:44:22,110 --> 01:44:33,457
[SPEAKER_50]: we're pretty intertwined with fossil fuels, and in some cases, pretty intimately, like with the sex toys, and it would be a pretty messy breakup, I would say, with fossil fuels.

920
01:44:33,637 --> 01:44:51,129
[SPEAKER_50]: So considering all of that, I would say we need to be more mature about what we're divesting from, and to realize that we live in a very complex world with a lot of trade-offs, and we shouldn't just make simple yes-no decisions, this is good, this is evil.

921
01:44:51,809 --> 01:44:52,129
[SPEAKER_50]: Thank you.

922
01:44:59,272 --> 01:45:00,133
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

923
01:45:00,193 --> 01:45:01,733
[SPEAKER_64]: We will return to Zoom.

924
01:45:02,974 --> 01:45:04,875
[SPEAKER_64]: David Harris, I will ask you to unmute.

925
01:45:04,895 --> 01:45:05,655
[SPEAKER_64]: You have three minutes.

926
01:45:11,918 --> 01:45:14,939
[SPEAKER_69]: There you go, David.

927
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:16,000
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

928
01:45:18,170 --> 01:45:18,470
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

929
01:45:18,490 --> 01:45:19,011
[SPEAKER_23]: We can hear you.

930
01:45:19,211 --> 01:45:19,591
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

931
01:45:19,972 --> 01:45:20,613
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.

932
01:45:20,673 --> 01:45:21,814
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is David Harris.

933
01:45:21,934 --> 01:45:25,299
[SPEAKER_23]: I've resided at 151 Sharon Street in West Medford for 30 years.

934
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:29,984
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm here tonight to support the values aligned local investments ordinance.

935
01:45:30,265 --> 01:45:34,570
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm grateful to the council for crafting and considering this critical piece of legislation.

936
01:45:36,377 --> 01:45:40,759
[SPEAKER_23]: Given the state of the nation and the world, I find it difficult to narrow my thoughts these days.

937
01:45:41,499 --> 01:45:55,924
[SPEAKER_23]: I will say, as someone who spent a career fighting the forces of mass incarceration, that I applaud the ordinance for requiring divestment from the vast and sadly growing prison industrial complex being fed by current policies of this government.

938
01:45:57,224 --> 01:46:02,126
[SPEAKER_23]: In keeping with the wording of the ordinance, I would encourage us, however, to think globally and act locally.

939
01:46:03,586 --> 01:46:17,214
[SPEAKER_23]: I turned to the insights of Dr. Luke Kent of the Center for the Study of Essential Risk at the University of Cambridge, who studied the collapse of more than 40 societies over 5,000 years, and he found that people are fundamentally egalitarian.

940
01:46:17,794 --> 01:46:22,077
[SPEAKER_23]: They are led to collapse by enriched status-obsessed elites.

941
01:46:22,937 --> 01:46:27,619
[SPEAKER_23]: He notes that past collapses often improved the lives of ordinary people.

942
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:33,541
[SPEAKER_23]: These previous collapses were regional, however, and he is pessimistic about the impending global collapse.

943
01:46:36,422 --> 01:46:37,602
[SPEAKER_23]: According to Kent, today,

944
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:47,068
[SPEAKER_23]: People find it easier to imagine that we can build intelligence on silicon, that we can do democracy at scale, or that we can escape arms races.

945
01:46:47,709 --> 01:46:49,491
[SPEAKER_23]: Of course we can do democracy at scale.

946
01:46:49,651 --> 01:46:55,837
[SPEAKER_23]: We're naturally social, altruistic, democratic species, and we all have an anti-dominance intuition.

947
01:46:56,237 --> 01:46:58,099
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what we're built for, he says.

948
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:03,195
[SPEAKER_23]: He goes on, collapse isn't just caused by structures, but also people.

949
01:47:03,435 --> 01:47:06,598
[SPEAKER_23]: If you want to save the world, then the first step is to stop destroying it.

950
01:47:07,158 --> 01:47:11,442
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't accept relationships based on domination, and share power whenever you can.

951
01:47:12,427 --> 01:47:16,671
[SPEAKER_23]: Kent acknowledges the way forward is difficult and daunting, but he offers sage advice.

952
01:47:17,412 --> 01:47:20,255
[SPEAKER_23]: Even if you don't have hope, this is about defiance.

953
01:47:20,455 --> 01:47:25,940
[SPEAKER_23]: It's about doing the right thing, fighting for democracy and for people not to be exploited.

954
01:47:26,641 --> 01:47:30,565
[SPEAKER_23]: And even if we fail, at the very least, we didn't contribute to the problem.

955
01:47:31,623 --> 01:47:37,308
[SPEAKER_23]: I say we can make a mark by demanding that our tax dollars do not contribute directly to the impending collapse.

956
01:47:38,149 --> 01:47:39,950
[SPEAKER_23]: We can and must do better with our money.

957
01:47:40,691 --> 01:47:42,452
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.

958
01:47:45,595 --> 01:47:46,216
[SPEAKER_78]: Thank you, David.

959
01:47:50,199 --> 01:47:50,740
[SPEAKER_64]: Thanks, David.

960
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,441
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to the podium.

961
01:47:52,721 --> 01:47:53,862
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

962
01:47:53,882 --> 01:47:54,583
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

963
01:47:55,656 --> 01:47:58,037
[SPEAKER_54]: Good evening, Nick Giurleo, Forty Robinson Road.

964
01:47:58,758 --> 01:48:00,539
[SPEAKER_54]: I'll begin tonight with the positives.

965
01:48:01,279 --> 01:48:08,864
[SPEAKER_54]: First, I was happy to see that the ordinance was substantively revised, especially subsection D on the divesting from human rights abusers.

966
01:48:08,984 --> 01:48:14,908
[SPEAKER_54]: I think striking that word entity from the subsection, for example, was a very good edit as I think that word was a

967
01:48:15,828 --> 01:48:17,548
[SPEAKER_54]: contributor to it being overbroad.

968
01:48:17,568 --> 01:48:26,731
[SPEAKER_54]: And I was also pleased to see that my concern as to how the treasurer would make the determination of which entities fall into this category of human rights abusers.

969
01:48:27,131 --> 01:48:31,872
[SPEAKER_54]: I was glad to see that that was addressed as well by adding a subsection to section 2-698.

970
01:48:32,152 --> 01:48:39,814
[SPEAKER_54]: That, as I understand, establishes a criteria in which the treasurer is to make determinations on which entities

971
01:48:40,614 --> 01:48:45,639
[SPEAKER_54]: are abusing human rights, although I did hear tonight for the first time concerns about the partiality of that criteria.

972
01:48:46,022 --> 01:48:51,484
[SPEAKER_54]: I think that's something I will personally look into as well as something all of you perhaps should look into as well.

973
01:48:52,504 --> 01:49:00,686
[SPEAKER_54]: So overall, I'll say, I do think between the drafts ordinance was improved, but that doesn't mean I think that it's perfect or I think ready for a vote.

974
01:49:01,307 --> 01:49:08,809
[SPEAKER_54]: I think now we have to really focus our attention on subsections A through C. I know in the past meetings, speakers discussed that at length.

975
01:49:09,189 --> 01:49:12,070
[SPEAKER_54]: We really didn't see any edits there, that I noticed.

976
01:49:12,730 --> 01:49:15,252
[SPEAKER_54]: So my concern, again, with this is, once again, overbreath.

977
01:49:15,492 --> 01:49:19,094
[SPEAKER_54]: I think those sanction categories are far too over-encompassing.

978
01:49:19,114 --> 01:49:22,597
[SPEAKER_54]: And I do think they could potentially lead to unintended consequences.

979
01:49:23,197 --> 01:49:35,445
[SPEAKER_54]: So for example, a company that might derive more than 15% of its revenue from the combustion distribution or extraction of fossil fuels, that might not be as nefarious as you might assume.

980
01:49:35,465 --> 01:49:39,848
[SPEAKER_54]: A reality with fossil fuels is they do power the world, whether you like that or not.

981
01:49:40,457 --> 01:49:48,265
[SPEAKER_54]: We don't want to be unintentionally harming workers who are employed in these industries, when they're working under contexts that aren't unethical.

982
01:49:48,886 --> 01:50:01,519
[SPEAKER_54]: And the same reason I think would apply for the defense industry or companies that might assist with the logistics of running jails and prisons I mean for example with a company that just simply surprise the jail or prison food, I mean with the divestment ordinance apply to that.

983
01:50:02,900 --> 01:50:13,263
[SPEAKER_54]: You know, many of these businesses I think are ethical, even if you might kind of have utopian ideas about the world we want to live in, without maybe prisons or war, or anything else kind of bad.

984
01:50:13,823 --> 01:50:20,205
[SPEAKER_54]: So overall I guess my suggestion here is I think we do need to refine further I don't think this ordinance is ready for a vote tonight.

985
01:50:20,825 --> 01:50:26,107
[SPEAKER_54]: So I would hope that the Councilor who moved to approve for the first reading withdraw that motion.

986
01:50:26,667 --> 01:50:30,150
[SPEAKER_54]: We can continue this and continue to refine, continue to work on this ordinance.

987
01:50:30,230 --> 01:50:37,355
[SPEAKER_54]: I do think it's feasible, and I think it's ideal to have some sort of ordinance like this, but let's try to put emotions aside and do this the right way.

988
01:50:37,455 --> 01:50:44,801
[SPEAKER_54]: Let's do this prudently, rationally, and prevent the city from getting sued because of some problem with the ordinance.

989
01:50:45,382 --> 01:50:45,702
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

990
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:48,644
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

991
01:50:50,085 --> 01:50:51,746
[SPEAKER_64]: We will go back to Zoom.

992
01:50:52,187 --> 01:50:53,808
[SPEAKER_64]: Zachary, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

993
01:50:53,888 --> 01:50:55,189
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

994
01:50:55,229 --> 01:50:56,070
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

995
01:50:58,075 --> 01:51:00,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Zachary Chertok, 5 Allmont Street.

996
01:51:00,916 --> 01:51:03,416
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not here to concentrate on intent, but structure.

997
01:51:03,436 --> 01:51:23,600
[SPEAKER_07]: But first, given the PR storm and where it was initiated ahead of the meeting tonight, leading to the sizeable and noticeably partisan group in the chambers, it really isn't defensible anymore to say that what is now Section D doesn't involve Israel in some way and will not further the isolation of the Jewish community in Medford while serving for such precedent elsewhere.

998
01:51:23,620 --> 01:51:24,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, that aside,

999
01:51:25,473 --> 01:51:29,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do want to emphasize the issues of legal jurisprudence and fiduciary responsibility.

1000
01:51:29,975 --> 01:51:39,518
[SPEAKER_07]: The council is playing very fast and loose with these words without demonstrating an understanding or comprehension of what they mean or the risks that they open up to us if the policy engineering is not done right.

1001
01:51:40,178 --> 01:51:48,561
[SPEAKER_07]: It is evidence that you're willing to take risks with Medford's taxpayer dollars to serve overseas causes within ESG concerns that are not endemic to Medford.

1002
01:51:49,042 --> 01:51:52,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't doubt their validity, but it calls into question fiduciary responsibility.

1003
01:51:53,685 --> 01:51:58,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Those risks jeopardize our ability to even service the ESG goals here and now and into the future.

1004
01:51:58,507 --> 01:52:02,348
[SPEAKER_07]: If this is about ESG, the framework needs to be reviewed more thoroughly.

1005
01:52:02,368 --> 01:52:06,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And for reference, public participation opportunities on this have been weak and far between.

1006
01:52:06,429 --> 01:52:15,472
[SPEAKER_07]: To Council President Bears's memoranda were sent with legal considerations and an alternative draft framework to the mayor and to the council from my desk.

1007
01:52:16,072 --> 01:52:18,773
[SPEAKER_07]: For a memoranda submitted to the city council and the mayor's office,

1008
01:52:19,311 --> 01:52:26,117
[SPEAKER_07]: in-depth review of the ordinance with expert colleagues across the industry and academic practice and finance, CSG, international affairs, U.S.

1009
01:52:26,157 --> 01:52:27,438
[SPEAKER_07]: constitutional law, U.S.

1010
01:52:27,498 --> 01:52:44,474
[SPEAKER_07]: law, international finance, and more, has shown that the current draft version of the ordinance is too vague to be enforceable and opens the city up to broad inclusion of contracts as financial instruments that would otherwise hinder the city to procure the necessary materials for the low bid process for its ongoing operations.

1011
01:52:44,935 --> 01:52:48,356
[SPEAKER_07]: The language used is the problem, even if the intent notes otherwise.

1012
01:52:48,396 --> 01:52:49,616
[SPEAKER_07]: The wording does matter.

1013
01:52:50,456 --> 01:53:04,218
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, legal review showed significant issues with regard to framework jurisprudence noted in the submitted memoranda, leading to the consulted parties to co-draft an alternative ordinance framework that was submitted to the mayor ahead of tonight's council meeting on August 3rd, 2025.

1014
01:53:05,939 --> 01:53:11,039
[SPEAKER_07]: Regardless of the intent, an ESG can be a noble field and ultimately good for investment diversification.

1015
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:14,100
[SPEAKER_07]: The ordinance still contains severe risks and issues,

1016
01:53:14,547 --> 01:53:20,391
[SPEAKER_07]: that expose the city that I have to imagine are either unknown or are unexamined by this council.

1017
01:53:21,012 --> 01:53:35,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I highly encourage the council to take the professional review summary seriously, in addition to the community concerns surrounding the continued use of or recommended use of policy frameworks as official that the US government doesn't authorize, especially under the SEC.

1018
01:53:35,783 --> 01:53:42,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Said frameworks have further been shown to cause severe community divisions, going into the controversy surrounding their partisan influence.

1019
01:53:42,735 --> 01:53:52,040
[SPEAKER_07]: The ordinance needs to be redrafted to fully reflect fiduciary jurisprudence and ethical accountability and regulatory requirements towards its ESG intent.

1020
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Within its current state, it does not.

1021
01:53:54,961 --> 01:54:00,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Regardless of the intent of the ordinance, there is still significant work to be done on and around it.

1022
01:54:00,264 --> 01:54:00,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1023
01:54:00,664 --> 01:54:01,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Zachary.

1024
01:54:01,464 --> 01:54:02,045
[SPEAKER_07]: That's time.

1025
01:54:02,365 --> 01:54:02,685
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

1026
01:54:09,087 --> 01:54:11,690
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll go back to the podium name and address for the record, please.

1027
01:54:11,710 --> 01:54:12,430
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll have three minutes.

1028
01:54:13,091 --> 01:54:18,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Vincent Timmons and I'm a resident of Medford at 43 Winter Street, and I grew up here.

1029
01:54:18,756 --> 01:54:26,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a Mustang Hall of Fame athlete and attended my induction with Scarpelli, Councilman Scarpelli, and Medford is a really tight community.

1030
01:54:26,864 --> 01:54:29,487
[SPEAKER_08]: I even went to high school with Council President Zach Bears.

1031
01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:41,501
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm concerned with what's best for Medford as Councilman Scarpelli put it, but Councilman Scarpelli public funds increased as a direct result of mass death is not what's best for Medford.

1032
01:54:42,462 --> 01:54:45,986
[SPEAKER_08]: The city's bond rating is not more important than human life on earth.

1033
01:54:46,738 --> 01:54:47,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Please direct your comments through the chair.

1034
01:54:47,999 --> 01:54:48,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1035
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:53,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I will and I hope all of us will always support any action that values human life over capital.

1036
01:54:54,204 --> 01:55:01,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that Medford has shown itself to be a community that values human life by considering this ordinance, but must prove itself by passing this ordinance.

1037
01:55:02,631 --> 01:55:07,234
[SPEAKER_08]: All of our struggles are linked and human life doesn't become less precious if it's outside of the city limits.

1038
01:55:08,195 --> 01:55:15,062
[SPEAKER_08]: human lives including those systematically and brutally destroyed by Israel and with the full support and facilitation of the U.S.

1039
01:55:15,102 --> 01:55:23,551
[SPEAKER_08]: government, human lives include those being shut away in for-profit concentration camps, human lives include those who are being killed and displaced by climate chaos.

1040
01:55:24,412 --> 01:55:48,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I am horrified to watch the result of our government's explicit endorsement and facilitation of a genocide against the Palestinian people and we have a chance to pass an ordinance which gives at least our local government some integrity and even a chance to be leaders in a country that is sadly just now waking up to the mass murder of the last two years and the destruction of Palestinian life and land that has been taking place for nearly the last century.

1041
01:55:49,635 --> 01:55:59,222
[SPEAKER_08]: We are responsible as people who live at the heart of this empire, which has produced so much ecological destruction already through its misuse of public funds, to say no.

1042
01:56:00,223 --> 01:56:03,826
[SPEAKER_08]: I implore the council to approve the ordinance offered by Council President Zach Bares.

1043
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:10,091
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

1044
01:56:13,934 --> 01:56:14,755
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

1045
01:56:16,672 --> 01:56:17,553
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

1046
01:56:17,633 --> 01:56:18,794
[SPEAKER_64]: We will return to Zoom.

1047
01:56:19,815 --> 01:56:22,157
[SPEAKER_64]: Munir, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1048
01:56:22,197 --> 01:56:23,238
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1049
01:56:29,644 --> 01:56:30,184
[SPEAKER_78]: Thank you.

1050
01:56:31,846 --> 01:56:34,929
[SPEAKER_78]: My name is Munir Germanis, and I live at 3 Summit Road.

1051
01:56:35,895 --> 01:56:40,638
[SPEAKER_78]: I'm here today to urge the council to vote in support of ethical investment.

1052
01:56:41,438 --> 01:56:52,044
[SPEAKER_78]: After listening to many of the testimonies at the last city council meeting, I could not help but think, welcome to our world where opinions matter more than facts.

1053
01:56:52,845 --> 01:57:04,512
[SPEAKER_78]: My father, who had a 20-year successful law practice in Palestine, lost his practice, his house, and his land when the state of Israel was created because he was of the wrong ethnicity.

1054
01:57:05,359 --> 01:57:13,944
[SPEAKER_78]: In this city, where I have been a resident and homeowner for over 40 years, my family has repeatedly faced anti-Palestinian discrimination.

1055
01:57:14,704 --> 01:57:27,772
[SPEAKER_78]: My graduate physics advisor, who was a Zionist, left the country to go to Israel for the summer without organizing a defense committee, forcing me to scramble to find another advisor so I could graduate that year.

1056
01:57:28,815 --> 01:57:39,204
[SPEAKER_78]: My daughter's physics teacher at Bedford High refused to recommend my daughter's science project after she questions his extra credit question on their physics exam.

1057
01:57:39,765 --> 01:57:45,529
[SPEAKER_78]: The question he chose for extra credit in physics was, who is the prime minister of Israel?

1058
01:57:46,430 --> 01:57:56,159
[SPEAKER_78]: Rather than continuing in the AP senior year physics course, she opted to audit a physics course at Dufts and was the valedictorian in her class that year.

1059
01:57:56,990 --> 01:58:06,935
[SPEAKER_78]: The next year, while she was a freshman at Harvard, one of my daughter's dormitory classmates was openly boasting that her cousin shoots Palestinians in Israel.

1060
01:58:08,096 --> 01:58:23,705
[SPEAKER_78]: Relatives and friends of Medford residents are being killed daily by the Israeli army, by the thousands, with two-ton bombs, tanks, drones, or forced starvation, and daily incursions by right-wing colonial settlers in the West Bank.

1061
01:58:24,405 --> 01:58:33,593
[SPEAKER_78]: But to talk about this or criticize these horrendous actions, some of our fellow residents falsely equate this with attack on Jews.

1062
01:58:34,453 --> 01:58:50,987
[SPEAKER_78]: As many of my Jewish and Christian and even Israeli friends have repeatedly pointed out, some in this forum, such baseless accusations are false and are intentionally used by organized groups to silence any criticism of the Israeli government.

1063
01:58:51,707 --> 01:59:03,752
[SPEAKER_78]: Students who dare voice their legitimate support for the oppressed Palestinians are either kicked out of their colleges or arrested and imprisoned by ICE with the intention of deporting them or silencing them.

1064
01:59:04,253 --> 01:59:05,233
[SPEAKER_78]: I could go on and on.

1065
01:59:05,953 --> 01:59:18,439
[SPEAKER_78]: This logic sets a dangerous precedent for fascism where political dissidents who oppose the political objectives of the Trump administration are to be fired, imprisoned, and or deported.

1066
01:59:19,462 --> 01:59:24,845
[SPEAKER_78]: Instead of pitting marginalized groups against each other, we could imagine a better future.

1067
01:59:25,365 --> 01:59:33,750
[SPEAKER_78]: We could join together and stand up against discrimination and hate while defending our rights to criticize without exception.

1068
01:59:34,290 --> 01:59:35,651
[SPEAKER_78]: I applaud this time.

1069
01:59:35,871 --> 01:59:36,271
[SPEAKER_78]: Thank you.

1070
01:59:47,077 --> 01:59:47,918
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to the podium.

1071
01:59:48,078 --> 01:59:49,238
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1072
01:59:49,258 --> 01:59:49,959
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1073
01:59:50,079 --> 01:59:51,840
[SPEAKER_72]: Hi, my name is Dina Alami.

1074
01:59:51,960 --> 01:59:59,805
[SPEAKER_72]: I'm at 3780 Mystic Valley Parkway, and I want to thank President Bears and the City Council for giving us the opportunity to speak on this.

1075
02:00:00,506 --> 02:00:06,330
[SPEAKER_72]: I'm here tonight to urge you to support an ordinance that can save the rest of my 75 family members in Gaza.

1076
02:00:07,330 --> 02:00:14,172
[SPEAKER_72]: As we know, Medford currently has 12 million invested in accounts that include Lockheed Martin, the world's largest weapons manufacturer.

1077
02:00:14,872 --> 02:00:21,334
[SPEAKER_72]: And again, as we know, Lockheed Martin supplies Israel with fighter jets that have been extensively used to bomb Gaza.

1078
02:00:22,174 --> 02:00:27,556
[SPEAKER_72]: Last time I was here in support of this, I shared a glimpse of how these weapons have torn through my own family's life.

1079
02:00:28,496 --> 02:00:35,978
[SPEAKER_72]: Every minute that is wasted not ending our complicity in the genocide is another minute of my family's life at stake.

1080
02:00:37,508 --> 02:00:55,753
[SPEAKER_72]: I can sit here all day and share gut-wrenching stories from my family in Gaza, from my pregnant cousin and her entire family who were killed in a direct Israeli airstrike on their home, to my cousin's seven-year-old daughter who was shot and bled to death while peeking out of her window, shot by an Israeli sniper.

1081
02:00:56,533 --> 02:01:11,426
[SPEAKER_72]: To my cousin's father himself a doctor who was forced to amputate his own daughter's leg on their kitchen table after their home was struck by an airstrike to my elderly aunt suffering from Alzheimer's forced to live in a tent, which by the way is considered a luxury.

1082
02:01:12,588 --> 02:01:27,819
[SPEAKER_72]: Confused and sick to my uncle suffering from multiple strokes and forced to take a fourth of the medication that he needs to my cousin's pregnant wife, who was forced to walk from the north of Gaza to the south in search of an operational maternity hospital.

1083
02:01:28,820 --> 02:01:34,870
[SPEAKER_72]: Every single hospital in Gaza has been struck by F-16 airstrikes and are not operating to full capacity.

1084
02:01:35,390 --> 02:01:39,336
[SPEAKER_72]: The indiscriminate attacks on healthcare facilities should horrify everyone.

1085
02:01:39,837 --> 02:01:43,062
[SPEAKER_72]: This is violation after violation after violation.

1086
02:01:43,743 --> 02:01:46,084
[SPEAKER_72]: And yet still my family stories are not unique.

1087
02:01:46,485 --> 02:01:49,486
[SPEAKER_72]: Everyone in Gaza is experiencing this daily horror.

1088
02:01:50,087 --> 02:01:54,169
[SPEAKER_72]: The continued human rights violations of my family in Gaza can be stopped.

1089
02:01:54,669 --> 02:01:55,690
[SPEAKER_72]: You can stop this.

1090
02:01:56,350 --> 02:02:02,134
[SPEAKER_72]: We have to stop pretending that we are powerless in that you as an elected member should not weigh in on this.

1091
02:02:03,054 --> 02:02:07,977
[SPEAKER_72]: You've heard from multiple individuals at this meeting and the last meeting who feel harmed by this ordinance.

1092
02:02:08,478 --> 02:02:13,801
[SPEAKER_72]: But I asked the city council to consider that Palestinians are not just experiencing feelings of harm.

1093
02:02:14,181 --> 02:02:17,283
[SPEAKER_72]: They're enduring actual ongoing physical harm.

1094
02:02:17,984 --> 02:02:24,148
[SPEAKER_72]: You as a representative have a duty to make sure that human life is being protected and supporting this ordinance will do exactly that.

1095
02:02:24,468 --> 02:02:24,748
[SPEAKER_72]: Thank you.

1096
02:02:43,449 --> 02:02:44,850
[SPEAKER_64]: Excuse me, excuse me.

1097
02:02:45,751 --> 02:02:47,313
[SPEAKER_64]: We're not going to do outbursts from the audience.

1098
02:02:49,134 --> 02:02:49,835
[SPEAKER_64]: We're not going to do that.

1099
02:02:51,577 --> 02:02:52,538
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to Zoom.

1100
02:02:53,699 --> 02:03:00,465
[SPEAKER_64]: And for folks who are waiting to speak on Zoom, please prepare by having your full name in your Zoom username.

1101
02:03:00,525 --> 02:03:02,947
[SPEAKER_64]: I cannot call on people who don't have both the first and last name.

1102
02:03:02,967 --> 02:03:05,730
[SPEAKER_64]: This is a precaution against Zoom bombers.

1103
02:03:06,591 --> 02:03:07,412
[SPEAKER_64]: We will go to

1104
02:03:10,073 --> 02:03:11,214
[SPEAKER_64]: Please keep conversations.

1105
02:03:11,774 --> 02:03:13,736
[SPEAKER_64]: Please go outside if you're going to have side conversations.

1106
02:03:14,336 --> 02:03:16,538
[SPEAKER_64]: Andy, please take it outside if you're going to talk.

1107
02:03:20,001 --> 02:03:20,721
[SPEAKER_64]: Let's keep it quiet.

1108
02:03:22,963 --> 02:03:24,764
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go to Miranda on Zoom.

1109
02:03:26,025 --> 02:03:27,626
[SPEAKER_64]: Miranda, name and address for the record, please.

1110
02:03:27,666 --> 02:03:28,527
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1111
02:03:30,008 --> 02:03:31,269
[SPEAKER_44]: Hi, I'm Miranda Briceño.

1112
02:03:31,369 --> 02:03:32,430
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm at 2 Taylor Street.

1113
02:03:33,647 --> 02:03:34,927
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

1114
02:03:35,608 --> 02:03:38,828
[SPEAKER_44]: I am in favor of this ordinance, and I will tell you why.

1115
02:03:39,348 --> 02:03:46,970
[SPEAKER_44]: Investing in businesses that are helping destroy communities through violence, incarceration, or the climate crisis is a bad financial decision in the long run.

1116
02:03:47,610 --> 02:03:51,631
[SPEAKER_44]: Reinvesting in businesses that build and grow our economies is our financial responsibility.

1117
02:03:52,311 --> 02:03:58,473
[SPEAKER_44]: I'm eager to see my tax dollars responsibly invested in companies, projects, and banks that prioritize people over profit.

1118
02:03:59,053 --> 02:04:01,154
[SPEAKER_44]: How we spend our money is a statement of our values.

1119
02:04:01,734 --> 02:04:07,036
[SPEAKER_44]: As we exist in a capitalist system, how we spend our money is one of the few ways we as a city can...

1120
02:04:12,794 --> 02:04:25,727
[SPEAKER_44]: As we can, sorry, as we exist in a capital system, how we spend our money is one of the few ways we as a city can assert our ability to refuse participation in industries that are actively harming people, our environment, and prioritizing profit over people.

1121
02:04:26,527 --> 02:04:30,752
[SPEAKER_44]: I support that this ordinance recognizes the slow process that is divestment.

1122
02:04:31,352 --> 02:04:36,417
[SPEAKER_44]: We won't be able to move our money and accounts overnight from companies that are actively causing harm across the world.

1123
02:04:36,978 --> 02:04:46,587
[SPEAKER_44]: So deciding to actively choose contracts and do businesses with companies that are aligned with our values as a city as a result of this ordinance is just one crucial step in putting Medford on the right side of history.

1124
02:04:47,408 --> 02:04:52,093
[SPEAKER_44]: The idea that this issue doesn't affect Medford is naive at best and actively ignorant at worst.

1125
02:04:52,714 --> 02:04:55,056
[SPEAKER_44]: We live in a globalized world whether we want to or not.

1126
02:04:55,552 --> 02:05:08,876
[SPEAKER_44]: This is not about politics, this is about prioritizing humanity as we watch our climate degrade, we watch multiple genocides across the world, and our neighbors unjustly incarcerated so that private prisons and war industry companies can continue to profit.

1127
02:05:09,756 --> 02:05:15,378
[SPEAKER_44]: At a time when the federal government clearly does not care about anyone but billionaires, companies, and arming their allies,

1128
02:05:15,892 --> 02:05:17,433
[SPEAKER_44]: Medford must take a stand where we can.

1129
02:05:18,154 --> 02:05:27,181
[SPEAKER_44]: The federal government is already targeting Massachusetts and its communities, illegally so, and clearly the federal government does not care about legality, morality, or people at all.

1130
02:05:28,042 --> 02:05:43,133
[SPEAKER_44]: The same federal government that is spending our tax dollars to fund an armed Gestapo with no oversight, building prison camps on US soil, and further contributing to human rights violations, it is incumbent on Medford to take a stand and do what we can as a city to support people worldwide.

1131
02:05:43,534 --> 02:05:43,774
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

1132
02:05:50,640 --> 02:05:51,822
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Miranda.

1133
02:05:53,365 --> 02:05:54,287
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to the podium.

1134
02:05:54,527 --> 02:05:55,689
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1135
02:05:55,709 --> 02:05:56,511
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1136
02:05:56,771 --> 02:05:57,072
[SPEAKER_75]: Sure.

1137
02:05:57,653 --> 02:05:58,975
[SPEAKER_75]: My name is Michal Sholem Kesselman.

1138
02:05:59,175 --> 02:06:03,163
[SPEAKER_75]: I live at 499 Main Street in Medford, as I have for the last decade or so.

1139
02:06:06,077 --> 02:06:30,410
[SPEAKER_75]: I would have liked to spend the little time I have allotted for public comment tonight talking about the interesting technicalities of this ordinance that has gone through countless drafts and revisions, been discussed and dissected countless times by a diverse cohort from all across our city, as well as numerous experts outside of and within our administration and government, and emerged as what I believe to be one of the most tightly drafted ordinances to come before this council in years.

1140
02:06:31,067 --> 02:06:50,172
[SPEAKER_75]: However, as a Jewish resident of Medford, I have watched as certain interests have used fear-mongering and vapid equivocation to reframe this broad ordinance as a discussion about Jewish worries over antisemitism, rather than the expression of solidarity and action in the face of injustice and immorality that it actually is.

1141
02:06:50,926 --> 02:07:01,709
[SPEAKER_75]: For the Jews who are planning to make comments towards the topic of antisemitism, I beg you to just listen for a moment in genuine reflection and seriously consider the public comments you plan to enter.

1142
02:07:01,729 --> 02:07:20,853
[SPEAKER_75]: I have watched cynical partisan actors, neither Jewish nor particularly engaged in the Jewish community in our city, of which some of whom are not even residents, capitalize on these fears in a disgusting attempt to gain traction with a demographic that would likely otherwise be uninterested, if not antagonistic, of their politics and philosophy.

1143
02:07:21,714 --> 02:07:41,953
[SPEAKER_75]: Consider for a moment that many of the people extending their heartfelt solidarity to Jewish residents seeing anti-Semitism in chants, signs, and garb of protesters and others didn't say a single damn thing when many other neighbors shared stories of having family and loved ones murdered by a military using weapons our tax dollars pay for.

1144
02:07:42,694 --> 02:07:57,043
[SPEAKER_75]: They did not express a single lick of concerns to the other Jewish residents like myself who have very real concerns of having our livelihoods interfered with our physical safety put at risk from really speaking out on this issue as is materialized all across this country.

1145
02:07:57,922 --> 02:08:07,212
[SPEAKER_75]: I have said before, and I will continue to say, that even were this ordinance to directly, specifically, and only invoke Israel, it would still not be anti-Semitic.

1146
02:08:07,933 --> 02:08:17,343
[SPEAKER_75]: Israel is not Judaism, a religion, culture, and people that have existed for far longer in diaspora than in some silly blend of ethno-state and global ghetto.

1147
02:08:18,204 --> 02:08:19,705
[SPEAKER_75]: Nor is Judaism Israel.

1148
02:08:20,366 --> 02:08:29,371
[SPEAKER_75]: Moreover, to reframe any topic, even obliquely referencing Israel is referencing Jews as a global cohort is wildly dangerous in these times of rising authoritarianism.

1149
02:08:29,792 --> 02:08:35,595
[SPEAKER_75]: And when our government is giving serious consideration to the idea of stripping effectively anyone of citizenship and deporting them.

1150
02:08:36,056 --> 02:08:45,982
[SPEAKER_75]: Think about what it means to foster a narrative that Jews in the US who overwhelmingly vote and politically organized left are effectively Israeli first and foremost, and Americans only second.

1151
02:08:46,442 --> 02:09:00,432
[SPEAKER_75]: But more than this, consider what it means to the legacy of bloody tears and suffering under oppression experienced by all of our forebears when you attempt to provide an inarguably oppressive nation state the cover of weaponized allegations of anti-Semitism.

1152
02:09:00,832 --> 02:09:05,495
[SPEAKER_75]: What does it mean to the fundamental imperatives of not just our shared religion, but our shared cultural axioms?

1153
02:09:05,955 --> 02:09:09,338
[SPEAKER_75]: This is a larger discussion than I can have time for clearly.

1154
02:09:11,079 --> 02:09:13,561
[SPEAKER_75]: But I really do ask you to seriously reflect on this.

1155
02:09:13,721 --> 02:09:17,964
[SPEAKER_75]: And if you would like to discuss this further and in good faith, I'm always willing to lend an ear and shoulder.

1156
02:09:18,064 --> 02:09:19,845
[SPEAKER_75]: Just pull me aside and say shalom aleichem.

1157
02:09:31,012 --> 02:09:31,833
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to Zoom.

1158
02:09:33,234 --> 02:09:34,815
[SPEAKER_64]: Owen, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1159
02:09:35,075 --> 02:09:36,616
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1160
02:09:36,636 --> 02:09:37,437
[SPEAKER_64]: You will have three minutes.

1161
02:09:41,077 --> 02:09:43,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, one moment.

1162
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:50,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you President Bears for bringing this to the agenda and members of the city council for giving us this opportunity to speak.

1163
02:09:50,742 --> 02:09:53,603
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Owen Berson and I live in South Medford.

1164
02:09:53,984 --> 02:09:59,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I support the values aligned local investments ordinance and I urge the council to vote in favor.

1165
02:09:59,606 --> 02:10:06,390
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford should divest our tax dollars from corporations that are causing grave harm to human rights and the environment all across the world.

1166
02:10:06,950 --> 02:10:10,272
[SPEAKER_01]: This resolution's impact would go far beyond the genocide in Palestine

1167
02:10:10,678 --> 02:10:15,121
[SPEAKER_01]: to divesting from incarceration, environmental destruction, and war worldwide.

1168
02:10:16,342 --> 02:10:23,948
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I am speaking tonight as a Jewish resident of Medford who is devastated by the genocide that Israel has been perpetrating in Gaza.

1169
02:10:24,429 --> 02:10:30,713
[SPEAKER_01]: My Jewish values tell me that every life is precious and that we must act against any genocide of any people.

1170
02:10:31,074 --> 02:10:33,396
[SPEAKER_01]: Never again means never again for anyone.

1171
02:10:34,336 --> 02:10:39,040
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm angry and heartbroken that my Medford tax dollars are supporting weapons companies enabling

1172
02:10:39,423 --> 02:10:40,663
[SPEAKER_01]: and profiting from this genocide.

1173
02:10:41,584 --> 02:10:46,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, Medford City Council passed an important resolution in favor of a ceasefire in Gaza.

1174
02:10:46,966 --> 02:10:54,308
[SPEAKER_01]: We must back that ceasefire resolution with concrete action to divest from the weapons companies profiting from this ongoing genocide.

1175
02:10:55,129 --> 02:11:00,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend who lives in Massachusetts who grew up in Gaza and still has the majority of his family members living there.

1176
02:11:01,771 --> 02:11:04,792
[SPEAKER_01]: His parents, three brothers and four sisters all live in Gaza.

1177
02:11:05,426 --> 02:11:11,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of his friends and neighbors from Gaza have been killed by Israeli attacks in the past two years.

1178
02:11:12,428 --> 02:11:16,729
[SPEAKER_01]: The houses of all of his aunts and uncles in Gaza on his mother's side have been destroyed by bombing.

1179
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:23,151
[SPEAKER_01]: He estimates that 95 percent of his family members in Gaza have had their homes destroyed by Israeli bombing.

1180
02:11:24,932 --> 02:11:27,533
[SPEAKER_01]: And his parents' home in Gaza was destroyed in 2009.

1181
02:11:29,358 --> 02:11:37,825
[SPEAKER_01]: while it's rebuilt by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, that home now houses all of his displaced relatives who have lost their homes since October of 2023.

1182
02:11:39,266 --> 02:11:45,371
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend spoke of his unrelenting anxiety, fear, and displacement, and that of his loved ones in Gaza.

1183
02:11:45,972 --> 02:11:52,397
[SPEAKER_01]: This destruction and violence is funded by our Medford tax dollars, which are being invested in companies like Lockheed Martin.

1184
02:11:53,118 --> 02:11:54,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Lockheed Martin is one of the world's

1185
02:11:54,998 --> 02:12:04,505
[SPEAKER_01]: is the world's largest weapons manufacturer and supplies Israel with fighter jets, which Israel has been using to bomb Gaza, as well as military transport planes and missiles.

1186
02:12:05,065 --> 02:12:13,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford should immediately divest from fossil fuels, detention and prison companies, weapons companies, and companies perpetrating human rights abuses.

1187
02:12:14,111 --> 02:12:19,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Fossil fuel companies are responsible for pollution and climate change negatively affecting us all.

1188
02:12:19,555 --> 02:12:22,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Prison and detention corporations are profiting off of caging our neighbors.

1189
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:28,021
[SPEAKER_01]: And weapons companies are profiting from killing children and families and destroying homes and neighborhoods.

1190
02:12:28,621 --> 02:12:36,203
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is a community that values human and environmental wellbeing, and we must ensure that our investments align with these values.

1191
02:12:36,763 --> 02:12:40,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I urge the council to vote in favor of the values aligned local investments ordinance.

1192
02:12:41,224 --> 02:12:41,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your time.

1193
02:12:41,904 --> 02:12:42,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Owen.

1194
02:12:49,606 --> 02:12:50,686
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to the podium.

1195
02:12:50,706 --> 02:12:51,947
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1196
02:12:51,967 --> 02:12:52,627
[SPEAKER_64]: You have three minutes.

1197
02:12:54,595 --> 02:13:01,204
[SPEAKER_77]: So had in the five or six streets in Medford, I've been resident proud resident of Medford for the past 20 years.

1198
02:13:02,206 --> 02:13:10,857
[SPEAKER_77]: Our moral imperative is more than putting forth a climate change action plan and raising slogans of equality, equity and justice.

1199
02:13:11,518 --> 02:13:19,501
[SPEAKER_77]: It's a deeply ingrained sense of duty, even when it's very hard to do so, to act in accordance with our moral principles.

1200
02:13:20,222 --> 02:13:28,025
[SPEAKER_77]: It compels us to protect our future generations, our children, all children, all ethnicities everywhere.

1201
02:13:29,107 --> 02:13:35,830
[SPEAKER_77]: It is no secret that we have fallen short in doing so, and the time to act was yesterday, but it's never too late.

1202
02:13:36,651 --> 02:13:50,657
[SPEAKER_77]: The ordinance before us has a lot of great things in it that I support and I urge you to support and push forward, including the divestment from Chevron, the fossil fuel company, which has been reporting losses for the past six months, both in the U.S.

1203
02:13:50,697 --> 02:13:52,098
[SPEAKER_77]: and internationally, by the way.

1204
02:13:53,519 --> 02:13:59,844
[SPEAKER_77]: as well as divestments from the prison industry, a vestige of the illegalized slavery in our time.

1205
02:14:01,085 --> 02:14:05,769
[SPEAKER_77]: But the most pressing issue is the current lifestream genocide in Palestine.

1206
02:14:06,509 --> 02:14:12,835
[SPEAKER_77]: Moving Medford public tax dollars out of companies like Lockheed Martin, which shamelessly

1207
02:14:13,435 --> 02:14:23,583
[SPEAKER_77]: boasts about their tried weapons to showcase its effectiveness in murdering people is not only the right thing to do, it is the least we can do.

1208
02:14:25,250 --> 02:14:29,811
[SPEAKER_77]: especially as we continue to witness the ongoing slaughter of innocent people and lives in Gaza.

1209
02:14:30,771 --> 02:14:33,392
[SPEAKER_77]: These weapons were tried on my family members for sure.

1210
02:14:33,712 --> 02:14:35,732
[SPEAKER_77]: Last time I was here, I reminded you of this.

1211
02:14:36,232 --> 02:14:49,855
[SPEAKER_77]: In addition to more than 100 of my family members who were killed by airstrikes recently, my niece Naya, five-year-old right there, was recently killed along 72 more family members.

1212
02:14:50,914 --> 02:14:53,356
[SPEAKER_77]: Our entire bloodline is being wiped out.

1213
02:14:54,397 --> 02:15:05,526
[SPEAKER_77]: All were murdered in their homes during two Israeli raids using F-16 jets produced by Lockheed Martin and funded by us, Medford residents.

1214
02:15:06,647 --> 02:15:11,792
[SPEAKER_77]: The only way to stop a genocide is to stop investing in it now.

1215
02:15:12,512 --> 02:15:15,475
[SPEAKER_77]: And for those who think that this is an act against

1216
02:15:17,483 --> 02:15:19,885
[SPEAKER_77]: an anti-Semitic act, it's not.

1217
02:15:20,425 --> 02:15:28,231
[SPEAKER_77]: It's against any power, any entity that is capable of carrying these unimaginable atrocities everywhere in the world.

1218
02:15:28,531 --> 02:15:28,912
[SPEAKER_77]: Thank you.

1219
02:15:41,395 --> 02:15:42,156
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

1220
02:15:42,936 --> 02:15:43,857
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to Zoom.

1221
02:15:44,598 --> 02:15:46,119
[SPEAKER_64]: Jennifer, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1222
02:15:46,199 --> 02:15:47,200
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1223
02:15:53,105 --> 02:15:53,566
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

1224
02:15:54,106 --> 02:15:56,688
[SPEAKER_40]: Jennifer Yanko, 16 Monument Street.

1225
02:15:57,980 --> 02:16:09,042
[SPEAKER_40]: I want to thank the Council and particularly President Bears for bringing this forward and for the due diligence that's gone into crafting this ordinance, which I believe is prudent and rational.

1226
02:16:10,102 --> 02:16:11,203
[SPEAKER_40]: And I do think it's ready.

1227
02:16:13,743 --> 02:16:14,823
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll be very brief.

1228
02:16:14,863 --> 02:16:19,304
[SPEAKER_40]: I just want to register my very strong support of this ordinance.

1229
02:16:21,725 --> 02:16:22,025
[SPEAKER_40]: I think

1230
02:16:23,315 --> 02:16:25,077
[SPEAKER_40]: There's lots and lots to invest in.

1231
02:16:25,377 --> 02:16:27,939
[SPEAKER_40]: There's lots of life to invest in.

1232
02:16:28,620 --> 02:16:33,243
[SPEAKER_40]: We needn't be investing in weapons manufacturers.

1233
02:16:33,504 --> 02:16:43,532
[SPEAKER_40]: We needn't be investing in corporations that are contributing to the destruction of the environment and to life as we know it.

1234
02:16:44,273 --> 02:16:46,955
[SPEAKER_40]: I want to see us invest in life.

1235
02:16:47,055 --> 02:16:49,777
[SPEAKER_40]: And there's lots of things we can be investing in.

1236
02:16:51,911 --> 02:16:59,439
[SPEAKER_40]: Disinvesting in weapons manufacture and fossil fuels and prisons is not going to do us in as a city.

1237
02:17:02,643 --> 02:17:12,413
[SPEAKER_40]: I really would like us to think more long-term, the long-term benefits for our planet, for our world, for our children, for our grandchildren.

1238
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:20,494
[SPEAKER_40]: we can be both fiscally responsible and responsible to the future generations.

1239
02:17:21,274 --> 02:17:27,498
[SPEAKER_40]: So I've just, again, want to underline my very strong support for this ordinance, and thank you again for considering it.

1240
02:17:34,583 --> 02:17:35,284
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Jennifer.

1241
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:36,685
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to the podium.

1242
02:17:36,905 --> 02:17:38,105
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1243
02:17:38,165 --> 02:17:38,786
[SPEAKER_64]: You have three minutes.

1244
02:17:42,628 --> 02:17:47,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello, my name is Adriana Pell and I live in South Medford.

1245
02:17:47,610 --> 02:17:52,633
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to say thank you very much for giving me an opportunity to speak.

1246
02:17:53,173 --> 02:17:54,654
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to keep it very brief.

1247
02:17:57,935 --> 02:18:01,737
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm here and we're all here because we love our community.

1248
02:18:02,978 --> 02:18:09,621
[SPEAKER_15]: It's people and it's beautiful natural spaces, like the fells and the beautiful mystic lakes and river.

1249
02:18:11,592 --> 02:18:20,454
[SPEAKER_15]: It makes sense to shift our investments away from fossil fuels and pollution, away from genocide, and away from child labor.

1250
02:18:21,755 --> 02:18:31,457
[SPEAKER_15]: Through Bedford's Climate and Adaptation Plan, we have promised not to support harmful and outdated and unnecessary practices.

1251
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:38,504
[SPEAKER_15]: like fossil fuels and like investing in weapons manufacturers.

1252
02:18:39,325 --> 02:18:44,970
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's not invest in fossil fuel companies, which are also huge polluters.

1253
02:18:46,311 --> 02:18:47,632
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanna bring this home.

1254
02:18:48,433 --> 02:19:01,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Fossil fuels are also huge pollutants and big global companies like ExxonMobil have polluted our beautiful Mystic River in Everett at the ExxonMobil tank farm.

1255
02:19:03,452 --> 02:19:09,878
[SPEAKER_15]: Its spills for years, for decades, have dumped oil into our beautiful Mystic River.

1256
02:19:10,759 --> 02:19:25,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Environmental lawyers in our community have spent years and millions of dollars just trying to get Exxon to fortify its tanks to stop future spills.

1257
02:19:26,453 --> 02:19:30,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Finally, just last year, after decades and decades,

1258
02:19:31,687 --> 02:19:53,019
[SPEAKER_15]: Exxon finally announced it was giving up and it would sell to a developer in a special state deal in which we, the taxpayers, are ending up funding some of the estimated $100 million to begin to clean that site up.

1259
02:19:55,140 --> 02:19:59,783
[SPEAKER_15]: That is not fair, and we should not be investing in ExxonMobil.

1260
02:20:01,874 --> 02:20:16,321
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of pollution and other things, I still think of General Electric as a homegrown company, despite its horrible, horrible record in our state and elsewhere.

1261
02:20:16,341 --> 02:20:21,844
[SPEAKER_15]: In Lynn, most of the men in my family worked there.

1262
02:20:23,065 --> 02:20:27,587
[SPEAKER_15]: I spent many, many years in Lynn, many hours.

1263
02:20:28,607 --> 02:20:46,163
[SPEAKER_15]: But while it employed so many of us, it also massively polluted, dumping petroleum contaminants into the Saugus River and into the water supply, making shellfish at Lynn Beach ridiculously dangerous to eat.

1264
02:20:46,463 --> 02:20:47,244
[SPEAKER_64]: That's time, Adrienne.

1265
02:20:47,884 --> 02:20:49,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Cancer rates are sky high.

1266
02:20:50,126 --> 02:20:52,388
[SPEAKER_15]: Please pass the divestment ordinance.

1267
02:20:52,909 --> 02:20:53,369
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1268
02:20:53,690 --> 02:20:53,970
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

1269
02:21:01,112 --> 02:21:02,193
[SPEAKER_64]: We will return to Zoom.

1270
02:21:02,633 --> 02:21:04,173
[SPEAKER_64]: Mike, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1271
02:21:04,213 --> 02:21:05,274
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1272
02:21:07,975 --> 02:21:08,996
[SPEAKER_49]: Hold on, good evening.

1273
02:21:09,016 --> 02:21:10,176
[SPEAKER_49]: I want to make sure you can hear me.

1274
02:21:11,137 --> 02:21:11,777
[SPEAKER_49]: Yep, we can hear you.

1275
02:21:11,797 --> 02:21:12,337
[SPEAKER_49]: Go ahead.

1276
02:21:12,377 --> 02:21:12,577
[SPEAKER_49]: Good.

1277
02:21:12,958 --> 02:21:14,799
[SPEAKER_49]: Mike Cohen, 200 Brook Street.

1278
02:21:16,419 --> 02:21:19,041
[SPEAKER_49]: I want to thank people for speaking tonight.

1279
02:21:19,081 --> 02:21:23,763
[SPEAKER_49]: I know there's been a diverse variety of opinions.

1280
02:21:24,843 --> 02:21:25,544
[SPEAKER_49]: And I think this,

1281
02:21:26,812 --> 02:21:29,233
[SPEAKER_49]: Bill, the intentions are good in a lot of ways.

1282
02:21:29,293 --> 02:21:35,854
[SPEAKER_49]: I think most of us can say, for-profit prisons, obviously, who wants that?

1283
02:21:36,315 --> 02:21:37,395
[SPEAKER_49]: We want a better environment.

1284
02:21:37,835 --> 02:21:38,615
[SPEAKER_49]: That's awesome.

1285
02:21:40,936 --> 02:21:41,676
[SPEAKER_49]: We don't like ice.

1286
02:21:41,996 --> 02:21:43,176
[SPEAKER_49]: I think we can all agree on that.

1287
02:21:46,557 --> 02:21:49,318
[SPEAKER_49]: What we're seeing tonight, though, is a concern.

1288
02:21:50,078 --> 02:22:01,760
[SPEAKER_49]: And I mean, as a Jewish resident, but I think just as a good human being, there is too much going against Israel, who is literally fighting for her survival.

1289
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:13,202
[SPEAKER_49]: I think that, you know, we're talking about tonight what Israel's doing is wrong, but then no one's stopping to say, well,

1290
02:22:14,703 --> 02:22:17,866
[SPEAKER_49]: This wouldn't have happened if Hamas hadn't attacked Israel.

1291
02:22:18,767 --> 02:22:28,875
[SPEAKER_49]: And then we're seeing on the news, we're seeing what happens with Avatar David, who is being starved and who's being forced to dig his own grave.

1292
02:22:29,676 --> 02:22:31,638
[SPEAKER_49]: And that all is Hamas's fault.

1293
02:22:31,798 --> 02:22:34,981
[SPEAKER_49]: These are filthy, scummy animals who have no right to live.

1294
02:22:36,018 --> 02:22:40,401
[SPEAKER_49]: And not the Palestinian people, but that's, it is Hamas.

1295
02:22:41,021 --> 02:22:42,402
[SPEAKER_49]: And you know what?

1296
02:22:42,883 --> 02:22:45,644
[SPEAKER_49]: We need to take that into account before we pass something like this.

1297
02:22:46,305 --> 02:22:48,426
[SPEAKER_49]: And so it shows we're not ready to do that yet.

1298
02:22:50,207 --> 02:22:50,648
[SPEAKER_49]: So thank you.

1299
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:03,521
[SPEAKER_64]: Return to the podium.

1300
02:23:04,302 --> 02:23:05,543
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1301
02:23:06,064 --> 02:23:06,665
[SPEAKER_64]: You have three minutes.

1302
02:23:06,765 --> 02:23:08,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Naila Savage Romanos.

1303
02:23:08,306 --> 02:23:09,928
[SPEAKER_17]: I live on 13 Summit Ave.

1304
02:23:10,589 --> 02:23:14,033
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm testifying in support of the Ethical Investment Ordinance.

1305
02:23:15,835 --> 02:23:18,478
[SPEAKER_17]: I have lived in Medford for more than 40 years.

1306
02:23:19,359 --> 02:23:23,324
[SPEAKER_17]: My children went to Medford public schools and graduated from Medford High.

1307
02:23:24,400 --> 02:23:25,981
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm an immigrant from Lebanon.

1308
02:23:26,741 --> 02:23:29,842
[SPEAKER_17]: The village I grew up in was completely destroyed in 1983.

1309
02:23:29,982 --> 02:23:37,866
[SPEAKER_17]: As the Israeli military marched into our village, my family was displaced and dispossessed.

1310
02:23:38,526 --> 02:23:43,888
[SPEAKER_17]: We all scattered into different parts of the world, trying to collect our shattered lives.

1311
02:23:45,249 --> 02:23:52,512
[SPEAKER_17]: I listened to the city council meeting on July 15, and I heard the testimonies of the members of our Jewish community in Medford,

1312
02:23:53,513 --> 02:23:58,438
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to say that I heard you, and I want to acknowledge your fears.

1313
02:23:59,620 --> 02:24:08,710
[SPEAKER_17]: But I also want you to acknowledge mine, and to recognize and address the fears and the pain and suffering of my sisters and brothers from Gaza and the West Bank.

1314
02:24:10,003 --> 02:24:29,550
[SPEAKER_17]: Since 1945, the end of the Holocaust, which we should all condemn, more than 55 million civilians have perished in more than 89 major genocides around the world, to name a few, the Congo, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and most recently, Sudan, perpetrated by the United Arab Emirates.

1315
02:24:30,970 --> 02:24:38,633
[SPEAKER_17]: These continued wars only benefit the weapons manufacturers and billionaire CEOs like our current president,

1316
02:24:39,987 --> 02:24:51,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Our city funds are currently invested in Lockheed Martin, which sends F-35 jets that drop bunker buster bombs on families sheltering in tents in Gaza.

1317
02:24:52,151 --> 02:24:58,553
[SPEAKER_17]: We should not be forced to fund war crimes against our will for nearly two years.

1318
02:24:59,437 --> 02:25:02,218
[SPEAKER_17]: We called Senators Markey and Warren and Rep.

1319
02:25:02,258 --> 02:25:08,302
[SPEAKER_17]: Clark with little impact, which is why we find ourselves here in our local city council.

1320
02:25:08,982 --> 02:25:17,987
[SPEAKER_17]: This ordinance is an opportunity to take back our tax dollars from a government which has run far astray of the will of the public.

1321
02:25:18,747 --> 02:25:24,793
[SPEAKER_17]: Only 32% of Americans currently support Israel's genocide in Gaza.

1322
02:25:25,373 --> 02:25:26,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Where is our democracy?

1323
02:25:26,975 --> 02:25:29,437
[SPEAKER_17]: It's right here in this council chambers.

1324
02:25:29,777 --> 02:25:30,197
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1325
02:25:37,544 --> 02:25:38,625
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

1326
02:25:39,706 --> 02:25:41,127
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to Zoom.

1327
02:25:41,287 --> 02:25:42,929
[SPEAKER_64]: Takeo, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1328
02:25:42,949 --> 02:25:43,910
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1329
02:25:45,759 --> 02:25:48,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, I'm Takeo Rivera, 75 4th Street.

1330
02:25:48,601 --> 02:25:56,906
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to once again thank President Barreras for this excellent ordinance, and I speak out in support of it again, as I did in the previous city council meeting on June 24th.

1331
02:25:57,847 --> 02:26:12,737
[SPEAKER_14]: In that meeting, I spoke on how Hartford is a wonderful place to raise a family, that this ordinance is one that allows the city to live its values to support children, children victims of bombings and intentional famine abroad, children's futures in the face of ecological collapse.

1332
02:26:13,477 --> 02:26:16,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Children criminalized for the color of their skin or the country of origin.

1333
02:26:17,042 --> 02:26:24,131
[SPEAKER_14]: Rather than rehash my remarks from June, today I would like to rebut some of the arguments against this ordinance.

1334
02:26:24,872 --> 02:26:31,240
[SPEAKER_14]: The first misleading argument is number one, that this is divisive or makes people feel unsafe.

1335
02:26:32,201 --> 02:26:33,741
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we're already divided.

1336
02:26:34,402 --> 02:26:37,803
[SPEAKER_14]: With the status quo of investment in these companies, our city has already taken a side.

1337
02:26:38,423 --> 02:26:46,945
[SPEAKER_14]: The people who feel most unsafe are the ones who are in direct danger of bombings, bullets, and barbaric starvation campaigns that are actually happening, not hypothetical ones.

1338
02:26:47,665 --> 02:26:56,708
[SPEAKER_14]: We heard testimony in June and today from people who lost countless family members to this unspeakable systematic violence.

1339
02:26:58,406 --> 02:27:08,692
[SPEAKER_14]: The great Massachusetts-based philosopher John Rawls taught us that, and if we fail our community members whose families are being directly slaughtered by companies we're invested in, then we should be judged quite harshly and deeply.

1340
02:27:09,973 --> 02:27:14,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Laws argument number two, Medford should concern itself only with local affairs.

1341
02:27:14,356 --> 02:27:15,997
[SPEAKER_14]: It won't do anything.

1342
02:27:17,218 --> 02:27:26,364
[SPEAKER_14]: So besides the fact that, as I just stated, residents of Medford have families directly impacted by the ongoing genocide, and all of us are affected by climate change,

1343
02:27:27,204 --> 02:27:30,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Divestment campaigns work and usually occur at the local level.

1344
02:27:31,887 --> 02:27:35,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Local divestment campaigns were vital for the ending of South African apartheid, for example.

1345
02:27:35,829 --> 02:27:39,991
[SPEAKER_14]: And as President Bears argued convincingly in June, this is important for the morale of the city.

1346
02:27:40,011 --> 02:27:45,294
[SPEAKER_14]: False argument number three, that this ordinance is somehow anti-Semitic.

1347
02:27:46,537 --> 02:27:50,778
[SPEAKER_14]: So besides the fact that there is no specific language about Israel per se, let me point out something larger.

1348
02:27:50,798 --> 02:27:58,380
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to argue that to conflate Israel with Judaism is in fact a form of anti-Semitism.

1349
02:27:59,100 --> 02:28:04,842
[SPEAKER_14]: I say this as a Japanese-American whose great-grandfather was incarcerated by the US government after the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

1350
02:28:05,642 --> 02:28:06,822
[SPEAKER_14]: During World War II, the U.S.

1351
02:28:06,842 --> 02:28:14,224
[SPEAKER_14]: government equated all Japanese-Americans with Imperial Japan, and doing so led to Executive Order 906S and our mass incarceration.

1352
02:28:14,825 --> 02:28:25,528
[SPEAKER_14]: We as a community were desperate to dissociate ourselves from the atrocities committed by Imperial Japan.

1353
02:28:25,648 --> 02:28:26,428
[SPEAKER_64]: Takeo, you're breaking up.

1354
02:28:28,788 --> 02:28:43,594
[SPEAKER_14]: that the US government committed one of the greatest abridgments of our civil rights in Japan as a puppet pan or Israel, we must be in staunch opposition to the horrors we see unfolding for our eyes, especially when there is something we can do now to send a message to companies directly.

1355
02:28:47,176 --> 02:28:49,917
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

1356
02:28:54,618 --> 02:28:55,519
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to the podium.

1357
02:28:55,759 --> 02:28:56,920
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1358
02:28:56,940 --> 02:28:57,720
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1359
02:28:58,481 --> 02:29:00,602
[SPEAKER_21]: Josh Eckert-Lee, 347 Main Street.

1360
02:29:00,762 --> 02:29:09,068
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm giving this comment in favor of this ordinance, not just for myself, but also a trio of Medford families who were in chambers earlier but had to take their children to bed.

1361
02:29:09,268 --> 02:29:11,929
[SPEAKER_21]: Those families are Kai Suleiman and his wife, Julia.

1362
02:29:12,410 --> 02:29:15,512
[SPEAKER_21]: Their children, Sham and Juliat, live at 25 Valley Road.

1363
02:29:16,332 --> 02:29:23,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Sahar and Ahmad and their children, Asad and Mohammed, who are four and one and a half, respectively, who live on Bowdoin Street, just down the road from me.

1364
02:29:23,767 --> 02:29:24,893
[SPEAKER_21]: and Ayyad and Nemeh.

1365
02:29:25,272 --> 02:29:30,833
[SPEAKER_21]: and their eight-month-old, Taya, who live on Leichhardt Drive in Medford, who are all staunchly in support of the ordinance.

1366
02:29:31,553 --> 02:29:38,975
[SPEAKER_21]: We urge you to support this ordinance and invest our public funds in ways that let us thrive and don't support destructive industries.

1367
02:29:39,355 --> 02:29:50,737
[SPEAKER_21]: Currently, today, our tax dollars are invested in portfolios that include global harmful industries like Chevron, like Lockheed Martin, and we already have this money invested in global geopolitics.

1368
02:29:50,777 --> 02:29:53,278
[SPEAKER_21]: This is not us wading into those concerns.

1369
02:29:53,958 --> 02:30:04,269
[SPEAKER_21]: I personally volunteer my time for the city as a member of the city's Energy and Environment Committee, which helps the city meet its goals set forth by the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, which has been quoted a couple of times this evening.

1370
02:30:04,730 --> 02:30:12,217
[SPEAKER_21]: That plan notes that climate change is rooted in a system of economic growth that extracts value without accounting for the real environmental and social costs.

1371
02:30:12,778 --> 02:30:20,462
[SPEAKER_21]: We currently have $12 million in funds that are invested in a portfolio that includes Chevron, the world's largest fossil fuel polluter.

1372
02:30:20,542 --> 02:30:28,426
[SPEAKER_21]: They've contributed over 40 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere and will continue to do so as long as it is funded by institutional portfolios like Medford's.

1373
02:30:28,886 --> 02:30:37,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Fossil fuel divestment is a common and essential tool that institutions regularly use to align their investments with their values like they've done in the city of Boston.

1374
02:30:37,810 --> 02:30:49,403
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been a long running effort as well amongst local climate activists here in Medford and I wanted to express my gratitude to those activists for the years and years of work and leadership that have gone into the ordinance that we have today.

1375
02:30:50,049 --> 02:31:05,820
[SPEAKER_21]: The ordinance is recognition of the interrelationship between multiple harmful entities beyond fossil fuels, like Lockheed Martin, which is currently invested in city funds and profiting off of the genocide in Palestine, and the prison industry, which is profiting off of the kidnapping of Metro residents by ICE.

1376
02:31:06,301 --> 02:31:17,849
[SPEAKER_21]: The breadth of industries is not designed to add complexity or hide the sort of human rights elements of this, but it recognizes the importance of these industries being part of one unified system of destruction upon harm.

1377
02:31:18,507 --> 02:31:23,329
[SPEAKER_21]: Mechanically, I also think this ordinance has been thoughtfully designed to make implementation easy and actionable.

1378
02:31:23,689 --> 02:31:32,873
[SPEAKER_21]: The addition of a guiding ESG standard in MSCI provides clear and straightforwardly followed models that are already designed to not invest in the industries listed in this ordinance.

1379
02:31:33,193 --> 02:31:38,595
[SPEAKER_21]: It's an industry standard and it's managed by Morgan Stanley, which is not known for being a group of radical progressives.

1380
02:31:39,217 --> 02:31:51,504
[SPEAKER_21]: The Prudent Investment Act, MGL Chapter 203C, Section 3, Subsection C8, provides clear allowance for considering an asset's special relationship or special value to the trust or its beneficiaries.

1381
02:31:51,824 --> 02:32:01,890
[SPEAKER_21]: As Council Members noted, this ordinance has a clear relationship to our Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, our Charter, and our well-being as Metro residents, and therefore resident for consideration under the Prudent Investor Act.

1382
02:32:01,970 --> 02:32:03,851
[SPEAKER_21]: So I urge you to consider this and move it forward.

1383
02:32:03,891 --> 02:32:04,171
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1384
02:32:11,080 --> 02:32:12,101
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go back to Zoom.

1385
02:32:12,401 --> 02:32:14,222
[SPEAKER_64]: Ken, I'm going to ask you to unmute.

1386
02:32:14,262 --> 02:32:15,123
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1387
02:32:18,406 --> 02:32:18,766
[SPEAKER_33]: All right.

1388
02:32:18,826 --> 02:32:19,767
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you so much.

1389
02:32:20,267 --> 02:32:21,968
[SPEAKER_33]: Ken Garrow, 52 Lambert Street.

1390
02:32:22,849 --> 02:32:24,691
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm here to broadly support this resolution.

1391
02:32:24,711 --> 02:32:31,436
[SPEAKER_33]: I actually previously had not spoken on this because I was a little curious about how this was going to evolve and adapt.

1392
02:32:32,317 --> 02:32:36,320
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm quite happy to see Section D had a more standardized

1393
02:32:38,666 --> 02:32:41,029
[SPEAKER_33]: framework put into place to define things.

1394
02:32:41,109 --> 02:32:43,331
[SPEAKER_33]: I think that vagueness was not helping anyone.

1395
02:32:44,212 --> 02:32:56,506
[SPEAKER_33]: I know many people are talking about the obvious elephant in the room, no pun intended, of things, but I think it is fairly evident across Medford, no matter where you stand,

1396
02:32:57,572 --> 02:33:06,715
[SPEAKER_33]: We value human life, whether that's trying to not support weapons, to support green initiatives, to help our planet.

1397
02:33:06,895 --> 02:33:09,076
[SPEAKER_33]: I believe these are all things we can stand by.

1398
02:33:10,076 --> 02:33:19,119
[SPEAKER_33]: People who feel that we are going to not meet our fiduciary responsibilities of these things, I think

1399
02:33:20,059 --> 02:33:29,047
[SPEAKER_33]: downplay how many options of investment opportunities there are in several of these things can spur additional help.

1400
02:33:29,527 --> 02:33:43,880
[SPEAKER_33]: Speaking of institutional investments, obviously if we shift things away from fossil fuels they will have less money, but we can shift these towards green research, green alternatives to all of these things which were previously mentioned in the meeting.

1401
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:48,481
[SPEAKER_33]: that engage our current existence.

1402
02:33:48,742 --> 02:33:55,824
[SPEAKER_33]: All of our technology can be modified and is in the process of being modified to be greener and healthier for us and our futures.

1403
02:33:57,144 --> 02:34:03,046
[SPEAKER_33]: So by and large, very much appreciative of this, fully support it, and great work, all of you.

1404
02:34:03,187 --> 02:34:06,988
[SPEAKER_69]: Thank you for your comments.

1405
02:34:09,545 --> 02:34:10,666
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go back to the podium.

1406
02:34:11,087 --> 02:34:12,388
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1407
02:34:12,428 --> 02:34:14,510
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1408
02:34:14,930 --> 02:34:17,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Benjamin Streim, 76 Marion Street.

1409
02:34:18,694 --> 02:34:21,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm speaking in strong support of the ordinance in the amended form.

1410
02:34:21,937 --> 02:34:32,527
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just wanted to start with responding to some comments today, but especially at the last hearing or session, and say that I'm sorry to hear that some people say that this ordinance

1411
02:34:33,348 --> 02:34:35,489
[SPEAKER_03]: will make them feel unsafe in Medford.

1412
02:34:35,789 --> 02:34:39,730
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can assure everyone that this is not truly not the intent of this ordinance whatsoever.

1413
02:34:39,750 --> 02:34:42,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that effect in any material sense.

1414
02:34:43,771 --> 02:34:49,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharing something personally, I do hate the idea that this would make anyone feel unsafe who feels Jewish.

1415
02:34:49,973 --> 02:34:50,673
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Germany.

1416
02:34:51,173 --> 02:34:54,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the grandchild and grand grandchild of people who fought in World War II for Nazi Germany.

1417
02:34:54,994 --> 02:35:02,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And at least on one side of the family, people were part of organizations affiliated with the Nazi Party early on.

1418
02:35:03,329 --> 02:35:10,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much they knew about the concentration camps, the deportations, the mass killings of Jews, and I don't know how much they supported it.

1419
02:35:10,797 --> 02:35:15,261
[SPEAKER_03]: It was never talked about in my family, as it was very common in post-war Germany.

1420
02:35:16,242 --> 02:35:18,144
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would like to know, what did they know?

1421
02:35:18,244 --> 02:35:20,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't they do anything?

1422
02:35:20,146 --> 02:35:20,727
[SPEAKER_03]: What did they do?

1423
02:35:21,648 --> 02:35:23,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Most likely, why didn't they do anything to stop this?

1424
02:35:24,911 --> 02:35:32,538
[SPEAKER_03]: It does make me sad that advocating for something like this, that seems so straightforward, following moral consciousness, would make people feel unsafe.

1425
02:35:33,119 --> 02:35:50,614
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, because of this history and because of moral consciousness, I think it's impossible to do nothing in the face of the genocide that's happening right now in Gaza, perpetrated by the Israeli state, with full support of the US, and also my home country, Germany, for that matter, again, supporting a genocide in the name of Jewish people.

1426
02:35:51,735 --> 02:36:07,003
[SPEAKER_03]: More than 60,000 people died or killed, more than 100,000 injured, 2 million being starved, repeatedly displaced, living on ruins, hospitals destroyed, universities, churches, anything that people need to live a life being taken away from them.

1427
02:36:08,123 --> 02:36:11,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, doing nothing, especially here in this country, supports this genocide.

1428
02:36:11,666 --> 02:36:12,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make you feel safe.

1429
02:36:12,988 --> 02:36:15,550
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually kills people, dozens of people every single day.

1430
02:36:16,891 --> 02:36:21,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford invests some of its money in Lockheed Martin and gets some interest payments from those investments.

1431
02:36:21,715 --> 02:36:26,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not much, but doing nothing right now means supporting the production of weapons that kill people.

1432
02:36:27,120 --> 02:36:28,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing nothing is not neutral.

1433
02:36:28,822 --> 02:36:29,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing nothing kills people.

1434
02:36:31,222 --> 02:36:36,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing also slowing things down kills people and the opposite, we need to speed up.

1435
02:36:36,704 --> 02:36:46,787
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine a child in Gaza today, if it would hear us talking about whether we should slow things down and wait and talk longer, whether we should invest in Martin or not, while the bombs are dropping.

1436
02:36:49,082 --> 02:36:52,765
[SPEAKER_03]: This ordinance is a very small thing that we can do now, and we absolutely must do.

1437
02:36:53,325 --> 02:36:56,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, it will encourage other cities and states to do the same.

1438
02:36:56,247 --> 02:37:03,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Divestment was a powerful tool in the fight against apartheid in South Africa, and it will be the same in this fight against apartheid and genocide in Palestine.

1439
02:37:04,773 --> 02:37:08,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you, councillors, for having the courage to vote on this ordinance today.

1440
02:37:08,756 --> 02:37:09,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1441
02:37:09,097 --> 02:37:16,242
[SPEAKER_64]: We will go back to Zoom.

1442
02:37:18,564 --> 02:37:20,152
[SPEAKER_64]: Rachel, I'm going to ask to unmute you.

1443
02:37:20,352 --> 02:37:21,639
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1444
02:37:21,679 --> 02:37:22,523
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1445
02:37:29,413 --> 02:37:35,255
[SPEAKER_73]: Thank you, my name is Rachel Sonsnag and I live at 86 Golden Ave.

1446
02:37:36,156 --> 02:37:48,360
[SPEAKER_73]: As a Medford constituent and homeowner, I urge you to support efforts to divest our tax dollars from fossil fuel companies, weapons manufacturers, prisons, and human rights violators.

1447
02:37:49,141 --> 02:37:54,323
[SPEAKER_73]: The city should invest our tax dollars sustainably and in companies that align with our values.

1448
02:37:55,460 --> 02:37:59,461
[SPEAKER_73]: I'm hearing concerns about passing ordinances like these too fast.

1449
02:38:00,262 --> 02:38:08,845
[SPEAKER_73]: My concern is that we haven't passed an ordinance like this already to ensure that the city is investing in a sustainable, just, and regenerative economy.

1450
02:38:09,685 --> 02:38:13,546
[SPEAKER_73]: Human-caused climate change was first discussed in the 1950s.

1451
02:38:14,066 --> 02:38:24,050
[SPEAKER_73]: We have now known for literal decades with building evidence that human-caused climate change is real, and if allowed to go unchecked, will cause devastation for humanity and this planet.

1452
02:38:24,910 --> 02:38:39,062
[SPEAKER_73]: The Black Lives Matters movement drew attention to incarceration as a tool of our racial oppression, and research has increasingly shown prisons are a cruel default method to handle social issues, including homelessness, unemployment, and mental illness.

1453
02:38:39,783 --> 02:38:44,687
[SPEAKER_73]: We have had literal genocide happening in Gaza, live-streamed for almost two years.

1454
02:38:45,408 --> 02:38:51,132
[SPEAKER_73]: If we don't move now towards a city that invests in a safe and healthy future for our communities, when?

1455
02:38:52,258 --> 02:39:02,127
[SPEAKER_73]: I want the city to invest responsibly, and that means investing in funds and businesses that are aligned with the city's values and mission to improve the well-being of our community and environment.

1456
02:39:02,908 --> 02:39:03,769
[SPEAKER_73]: Thank you for your time.

1457
02:39:09,274 --> 02:39:10,175
[SPEAKER_72]: Thank you for your comments.

1458
02:39:10,195 --> 02:39:12,937
[SPEAKER_58]: Name and address for the record, please.

1459
02:39:12,997 --> 02:39:13,758
[SPEAKER_58]: You'll have three minutes.

1460
02:39:14,479 --> 02:39:15,680
[SPEAKER_58]: Hi, I'm Tracy Noble.

1461
02:39:15,740 --> 02:39:17,461
[SPEAKER_58]: I live on Sharon Street in Medford.

1462
02:39:18,668 --> 02:39:21,593
[SPEAKER_58]: I support the values aligned local investments ordinance.

1463
02:39:21,934 --> 02:39:28,085
[SPEAKER_58]: This is my first time speaking up at a city council meeting and I appreciate the opportunity that you give all residents to speak.

1464
02:39:29,698 --> 02:39:40,762
[SPEAKER_58]: I've been watching the news about the horrific effects of climate change all around the world, in particular, right now, in wildfires in Canada that are polluting the air outside at this very moment.

1465
02:39:41,502 --> 02:39:54,867
[SPEAKER_58]: I've also, of course, been watching the same news of wars that you all have been talking about, live streamed from Gaza and around the world, in which civilians, including children, are injured and killed by weapons of war and starved of food and water.

1466
02:39:56,124 --> 02:40:02,912
[SPEAKER_58]: I have felt powerless to do anything about these events because of the tremendous power of fossil fuel companies, their political allies.

1467
02:40:03,572 --> 02:40:07,553
[SPEAKER_58]: and the governments and businesses involved in wars and human rights abuses.

1468
02:40:08,333 --> 02:40:11,214
[SPEAKER_58]: And then I learned of this ordinance and that there was something I can do.

1469
02:40:11,794 --> 02:40:18,736
[SPEAKER_58]: I can stand in support of our courageous city councilors and the activists who have worked with them on this ordinance.

1470
02:40:19,357 --> 02:40:30,140
[SPEAKER_58]: I can encourage Medford city government to withdraw financial support from the businesses that are responsible for fossil fuel production and for supplying the weapons that are used to kill civilians around the world.

1471
02:40:31,020 --> 02:40:36,604
[SPEAKER_58]: I believe that if the city of Medford stands up for what we believe in, this will give other cities the courage to do the same.

1472
02:40:37,224 --> 02:40:42,428
[SPEAKER_58]: And that financial pressure, as others have mentioned, can make a difference to the businesses that it targets.

1473
02:40:42,928 --> 02:40:48,392
[SPEAKER_58]: In this case, those businesses that profit from the abuse of the environment and the abuse of human rights.

1474
02:40:49,173 --> 02:40:54,256
[SPEAKER_58]: I support the values aligned local investments ordinance and I encourage the city council to pass it.

1475
02:40:54,456 --> 02:40:55,137
[SPEAKER_58]: Thank you very much.

1476
02:41:01,886 --> 02:41:02,746
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to Zoom.

1477
02:41:02,987 --> 02:41:05,208
[SPEAKER_64]: Anna, I'm going to ask to unmute you.

1478
02:41:05,628 --> 02:41:06,848
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1479
02:41:06,888 --> 02:41:07,489
[SPEAKER_64]: You have three minutes.

1480
02:41:11,030 --> 02:41:12,731
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, my name is Anna Meyer.

1481
02:41:12,811 --> 02:41:15,612
[SPEAKER_31]: I live at 6 Douglas Road.

1482
02:41:15,933 --> 02:41:26,678
[SPEAKER_31]: I am so grateful to the Medford residents who helped write this ordinance and especially to President Bears for his work over the last eight months in making sure that this ordinance is as clear as possible

1483
02:41:27,498 --> 02:41:31,320
[SPEAKER_31]: is aligned with Massachusetts state law and is in the best interests of Medford.

1484
02:41:32,181 --> 02:41:36,604
[SPEAKER_31]: I've spoken in favor of this ordinance before, and so I'm going to try to keep my comments brief.

1485
02:41:37,664 --> 02:41:44,729
[SPEAKER_31]: But fundamentally, the world that I want to be a part of and one that I try to work towards every day is one that values the lives of children everywhere.

1486
02:41:45,690 --> 02:41:48,853
[SPEAKER_31]: and is trying to create a safer and healthier world from everyone.

1487
02:41:50,055 --> 02:41:55,301
[SPEAKER_31]: I believe this is a powerful moment to reimagine the kind of community that we want to create and be a part of.

1488
02:41:56,181 --> 02:42:01,688
[SPEAKER_31]: I think this ordinance speaks to aligning our values, because the way that we spend our money is political.

1489
02:42:02,508 --> 02:42:09,891
[SPEAKER_31]: If there are companies that meet the standard of this ordinance, meaning that they make their profit from fossil fuels and the city can't invest in them anymore, I think that's the point.

1490
02:42:10,311 --> 02:42:15,974
[SPEAKER_31]: The way that we invest our money can put pressure on companies to stop profiting from fossil fuels and other harmful measures.

1491
02:42:17,270 --> 02:42:23,134
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm especially proud of the way that this ordinance will ensure that Medford is not and will not be invested in detention centers.

1492
02:42:24,014 --> 02:42:37,282
[SPEAKER_31]: I work in immigration advocacy, and I know that in talking to so many community members in Medford, how shocked they were to watch Masks, agent of the state, kidnap Tufts graduate student Ramesa Ozturk earlier this spring.

1493
02:42:37,783 --> 02:42:40,224
[SPEAKER_31]: I know so many of my neighbors have felt overwhelmed and helpless.

1494
02:42:40,664 --> 02:42:43,126
[SPEAKER_31]: and helpless in the face of this cruelty.

1495
02:42:43,146 --> 02:42:53,172
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think that this is such a powerful moment to get to say and take a stand that Medford does not stand for this violence, and also will not benefit from the

1496
02:42:56,814 --> 02:42:59,836
[SPEAKER_31]: will not profit or in any way benefit from these detention centers.

1497
02:43:00,296 --> 02:43:10,061
[SPEAKER_31]: On Sunday, I rallied with Jewish community members, including some from Medford outside of the ICE office in Burlington, because they object to the weaponization of anti-Semitism that justify these kidnappings.

1498
02:43:10,781 --> 02:43:12,702
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm also a high school history teacher.

1499
02:43:12,722 --> 02:43:25,008
[SPEAKER_31]: I am alarmed to see that ICE is also detaining high school students, including Marcelo Gomez da Silva, who was taken to that ICE facility in Burlington, where we know that people are sleeping on concrete floors, eating crackers for dinner.

1500
02:43:26,789 --> 02:43:31,012
[SPEAKER_31]: We know where Mesa Ozturk was taken to a facility where she was not given adequate food and medical treatment.

1501
02:43:31,472 --> 02:43:35,855
[SPEAKER_31]: And I'm so proud that this ordinance will affirm that Medford tax dollars will not be invested in those systems.

1502
02:43:36,476 --> 02:43:40,358
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm also proud of the way this ordinance speaks to the way in which these systems are interconnected.

1503
02:43:40,699 --> 02:43:44,861
[SPEAKER_31]: I've heard some speakers say tonight they want to divest from fossil fuel, but they're hesitant to divest from Israel.

1504
02:43:45,422 --> 02:43:48,584
[SPEAKER_31]: The strength of this ordinance is that it shows us how these values are interconnected.

1505
02:43:48,704 --> 02:43:54,148
[SPEAKER_31]: IDF bombing has destroyed fresh drinking water on farmland in Gaza and contributed significantly to carbon pollution.

1506
02:43:54,668 --> 02:44:01,971
[SPEAKER_31]: to protect the environment, needs to stop the ruthless bombing and starvation in Gaza, and divesting from companies that profit from fossil fuel and weapons will do both of those things.

1507
02:44:03,091 --> 02:44:07,572
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm so moved by all my community members who have spoken tonight in favor of creating this world together.

1508
02:44:07,912 --> 02:44:11,214
[SPEAKER_31]: My thanks to you all, and I urge city councilors to vote in favor of this ordinance.

1509
02:44:11,534 --> 02:44:11,854
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1510
02:44:18,336 --> 02:44:19,196
[SPEAKER_64]: Back to the podium.

1511
02:44:19,596 --> 02:44:20,977
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1512
02:44:21,037 --> 02:44:21,717
[SPEAKER_64]: You have three minutes.

1513
02:44:22,557 --> 02:44:22,918
[SPEAKER_46]: My name.

1514
02:44:27,406 --> 02:44:28,907
[SPEAKER_46]: My name is Ellen Epstein.

1515
02:44:28,927 --> 02:44:36,352
[SPEAKER_46]: I'm a Jewish resident of Medford, and I'm speaking up tonight in support of the values aligned investment ordinance.

1516
02:44:38,493 --> 02:44:42,336
[SPEAKER_46]: And once again I'm proud of our city Councilors for bringing this forward.

1517
02:44:43,587 --> 02:44:59,595
[SPEAKER_46]: The idea of values-aligned investing is not new, it's not radical, it dates back several centuries to the Quakers who refused to invest in the slave trade and weapons manufacturing activities they found morally harmful.

1518
02:45:01,496 --> 02:45:09,120
[SPEAKER_46]: It has been a sound, profitable, and well-recognized part of the financial services industry since the mid-1980s.

1519
02:45:15,847 --> 02:45:23,491
[SPEAKER_46]: We here today are hypocritical if, as a city, we do not align our investments with our values.

1520
02:45:24,291 --> 02:45:31,554
[SPEAKER_46]: If we endorse recycling and composting and tree planting, but continue to invest in fossil fuel companies.

1521
02:45:32,415 --> 02:45:45,321
[SPEAKER_46]: If we celebrate Pride Month, but hold stock in companies that discriminate against the LGBTQ community, or call for a ceasefire, but invest in companies that provide weapons of war around the world.

1522
02:45:47,006 --> 02:45:58,054
[SPEAKER_46]: Today, it is common for investment firms of all stripes to follow the MSCISG guidelines, the same ones that our municipal fiduciaries will have to follow.

1523
02:45:59,114 --> 02:46:04,038
[SPEAKER_46]: Fiduciaries are legally obligated to act in their clients' best interests.

1524
02:46:04,778 --> 02:46:11,343
[SPEAKER_46]: And I appreciate that the ordinance holds our treasurer to this high standard of safe and sustainable investing.

1525
02:46:12,814 --> 02:46:17,675
[SPEAKER_46]: Each time we spend or invest money, we are voting for the world we want.

1526
02:46:18,955 --> 02:46:28,858
[SPEAKER_46]: Dearborn, Michigan, and Portland, Maine have already adopted ordinances similar to ours, and the city of Boston has divested from fossil fuels.

1527
02:46:29,758 --> 02:46:38,640
[SPEAKER_46]: Let's do them one better and be the first city in Massachusetts to divest from weapons, prisons, fossil fuels, and crimes against humanity.

1528
02:46:39,862 --> 02:46:54,333
[SPEAKER_46]: With this ordinance Medford can set an example for other mass cities and at the same time inspire residents who are invested in the stock market to take a look at their portfolios and see what they're voting for with their dollars.

1529
02:46:55,718 --> 02:47:02,843
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you, President Bears, for helping us do all we can at the local level to promote a just and sustainable world.

1530
02:47:03,803 --> 02:47:05,645
[SPEAKER_46]: One quick question before I finish.

1531
02:47:06,465 --> 02:47:20,975
[SPEAKER_46]: In section A of the ordinance, fossil fuels, and section B, jails, prisons, and detention centers, the wording states that we shall divest from any company which derives more than 15% of its revenue from these objectionable sources.

1532
02:47:22,195 --> 02:47:23,556
[SPEAKER_46]: Why are we allowing even 15%?

1533
02:47:25,838 --> 02:47:31,379
[SPEAKER_46]: And as another question, I think a lot of us are wondering who's filming us tonight.

1534
02:47:32,479 --> 02:47:32,879
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1535
02:47:32,899 --> 02:47:43,222
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

1536
02:47:43,262 --> 02:47:45,682
[SPEAKER_64]: Councilors will have the opportunity to respond after a public comment.

1537
02:47:47,843 --> 02:47:49,383
[SPEAKER_64]: We will return to Zoom.

1538
02:47:50,303 --> 02:47:54,044
[SPEAKER_64]: Robert, I'm going to ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please.

1539
02:47:54,084 --> 02:47:54,844
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1540
02:47:58,287 --> 02:47:58,927
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

1541
02:47:59,808 --> 02:48:02,449
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Robert Payne, 15 West Street.

1542
02:48:03,290 --> 02:48:15,316
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also a member of the Energy and Environment Committee and I have heard other members be in support of this proposed measure and I am also in support of it.

1543
02:48:16,056 --> 02:48:27,022
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I do have some concerns about the aftermath of enactment in that so far, I think Bedford has been under the,

1544
02:48:28,402 --> 02:48:33,404
[SPEAKER_06]: glide path of being noticed by our President Donald John Trump.

1545
02:48:34,325 --> 02:48:45,650
[SPEAKER_06]: But he has unleashed all sorts of nasty lawsuits in other cases where he doesn't like what cities and states have done, executive orders, et cetera.

1546
02:48:45,991 --> 02:48:48,792
[SPEAKER_06]: And so could that happen to Medford?

1547
02:48:50,153 --> 02:48:54,675
[SPEAKER_06]: So is the city ready for this with personnel and budget?

1548
02:48:55,719 --> 02:49:10,893
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of legal pushback, possible sanctions, I don't know if there's any federal funds that they can withdraw, withheld, whatever, but I just wanna make sure that we're ready for what might happen if we pass this, although it's a very noble measure.

1549
02:49:11,454 --> 02:49:13,696
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just concerned that we have to be ready.

1550
02:49:14,437 --> 02:49:16,359
[SPEAKER_06]: And that concludes my remarks.

1551
02:49:19,482 --> 02:49:19,842
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Bob.

1552
02:49:22,348 --> 02:49:23,309
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll return to the podium.

1553
02:49:23,589 --> 02:49:24,870
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1554
02:49:24,930 --> 02:49:25,631
[SPEAKER_64]: You have three minutes.

1555
02:49:27,372 --> 02:49:29,474
[SPEAKER_61]: My name is Rony Simcha-Miller.

1556
02:49:29,494 --> 02:49:34,097
[SPEAKER_61]: I live at 59 Winchester Street here in Bedford.

1557
02:49:35,338 --> 02:49:46,507
[SPEAKER_61]: I want to thank President Bears in particular and the councillors here today for hearing this ordinance tonight and offering the opportunity.

1558
02:49:47,187 --> 02:49:51,790
[SPEAKER_61]: for me and many other of my fellow Medford residents to speak.

1559
02:49:51,990 --> 02:50:00,434
[SPEAKER_61]: And I'm here to speak very especially in support of this value aligned investment ordinance.

1560
02:50:01,875 --> 02:50:08,799
[SPEAKER_61]: I am a young disabled person so I apologize if I'm scratchy my disability is the same reason is.

1561
02:50:13,322 --> 02:50:24,090
[SPEAKER_61]: the very air quality index warnings that we get for more vulnerable members of our communities.

1562
02:50:24,871 --> 02:50:31,135
[SPEAKER_61]: I am one of them, and I'm dealing with the very immediate impacts of climate change today.

1563
02:50:33,817 --> 02:50:35,879
[SPEAKER_61]: I am a Jew.

1564
02:50:35,899 --> 02:50:37,921
[SPEAKER_61]: I am a trans person.

1565
02:50:37,941 --> 02:50:39,062
[SPEAKER_61]: I am a young person.

1566
02:50:39,122 --> 02:50:40,283
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm a person of conscience.

1567
02:50:40,363 --> 02:50:41,924
[SPEAKER_61]: I'm a neighbor to many people here.

1568
02:50:44,446 --> 02:50:47,388
[SPEAKER_61]: I don't have anything new to say.

1569
02:50:47,408 --> 02:50:51,812
[SPEAKER_61]: I think that every single day it feels

1570
02:50:54,338 --> 02:50:57,540
[SPEAKER_61]: Like we fall deeper and deeper into despair, like there's nothing to do.

1571
02:50:57,780 --> 02:51:05,143
[SPEAKER_61]: I want to push back against the idea that this is all talk, that it's empty, that it's virtue signaling.

1572
02:51:07,024 --> 02:51:13,347
[SPEAKER_61]: Divestment is very actionable, it's practical, it has a tangible material effect.

1573
02:51:15,253 --> 02:51:17,616
[SPEAKER_61]: and we're able to do it here locally.

1574
02:51:17,636 --> 02:51:25,085
[SPEAKER_61]: How many things right now can we actually affect on this global scale and on this massive but local scale?

1575
02:51:26,387 --> 02:51:31,813
[SPEAKER_61]: Do we feel like we could actually have some drop in the bucket in a city council meeting?

1576
02:51:34,376 --> 02:51:41,644
[SPEAKER_61]: We see, I don't want to focus on any one section, A through D, because they're all interconnected.

1577
02:51:42,625 --> 02:51:47,710
[SPEAKER_61]: You can't divest from fossil fuels without also divesting from weapons.

1578
02:51:48,190 --> 02:51:50,973
[SPEAKER_61]: You can't divest from prisons without

1579
02:51:51,753 --> 02:51:53,835
[SPEAKER_61]: divesting from war crimes.

1580
02:51:53,975 --> 02:51:58,198
[SPEAKER_61]: They're all interconnected, these horrific abuses against humanity.

1581
02:51:58,618 --> 02:52:10,526
[SPEAKER_61]: And I don't see why we have to think about everything as an attack against specific members of our community speaking on this as a Jew, because we're not, we're just divesting.

1582
02:52:10,766 --> 02:52:13,308
[SPEAKER_61]: We're just saying we would rather our dollars go here.

1583
02:52:13,648 --> 02:52:19,052
[SPEAKER_61]: Why do our dollars have to go and further these abuses against people around the world?

1584
02:52:19,437 --> 02:52:22,958
[SPEAKER_61]: Why do our dollars have to go into harming our planet?

1585
02:52:23,238 --> 02:52:28,620
[SPEAKER_61]: Why do our dollars have to go to putting people in prisons when we're seeing our neighbors be kidnapped off the street in broad daylight?

1586
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:30,180
[SPEAKER_61]: I just don't understand.

1587
02:52:30,200 --> 02:52:33,721
[SPEAKER_61]: And I thank you for your time.

1588
02:52:39,083 --> 02:52:40,183
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

1589
02:52:40,903 --> 02:52:42,124
[SPEAKER_64]: We will return to Zoom.

1590
02:52:42,364 --> 02:52:44,384
[SPEAKER_64]: Evan, I'm going to ask to unmute you.

1591
02:52:44,524 --> 02:52:47,065
[SPEAKER_64]: Please state your name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

1592
02:52:53,983 --> 02:52:57,205
[SPEAKER_18]: Evan Fontana, Somerville, Pennsylvania Avenue.

1593
02:52:58,466 --> 02:53:00,767
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Council, for letting me speak this evening.

1594
02:53:01,467 --> 02:53:03,188
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to be direct about this.

1595
02:53:04,089 --> 02:53:14,855
[SPEAKER_18]: I keep hearing for the past hour and a half that this isn't targeting Israel, but everyone seems to be very focused on only Israel.

1596
02:53:15,635 --> 02:53:18,737
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's reasonable to assume this is about Israel.

1597
02:53:20,478 --> 02:53:21,679
[SPEAKER_18]: And under the ordinance,

1598
02:53:22,798 --> 02:53:29,201
[SPEAKER_18]: My understanding is for human rights violations, we don't want to invest in these types of places.

1599
02:53:29,761 --> 02:53:36,684
[SPEAKER_18]: We need to be very mindful of our world and being part of the human race.

1600
02:53:37,624 --> 02:53:46,468
[SPEAKER_18]: So does this mean places like Bangladesh, which has excessive human rights violations, toxic waste from commercial dyes,

1601
02:53:47,230 --> 02:53:59,516
[SPEAKER_18]: Just last year, we had $8 billion worth of clothes come to the United States, just like the customized shirts for activists and other clothes for municipal employees.

1602
02:53:59,796 --> 02:54:02,317
[SPEAKER_18]: So does that mean Bangladesh is off?

1603
02:54:02,917 --> 02:54:13,562
[SPEAKER_18]: What about China, where the Uyghur Muslims for years have been locked up in actual concentration camps and re-education camps, forced to eat pork?

1604
02:54:14,602 --> 02:54:18,463
[SPEAKER_18]: child labor, or the products that you all own.

1605
02:54:20,323 --> 02:54:22,504
[SPEAKER_18]: Does this also include Google, Apple?

1606
02:54:22,944 --> 02:54:23,824
[SPEAKER_18]: What about our phones?

1607
02:54:24,304 --> 02:54:25,405
[SPEAKER_18]: What about Amazon?

1608
02:54:26,185 --> 02:54:27,805
[SPEAKER_18]: Will they also be divested from?

1609
02:54:29,185 --> 02:54:40,248
[SPEAKER_18]: Will the activists who have been coming up here and telling us moral judgment, moral clarity, will they also stop using these companies and stop purchasing from them?

1610
02:54:41,247 --> 02:54:44,349
[SPEAKER_18]: Israel is a global leader in agriculture technology.

1611
02:54:44,749 --> 02:54:45,849
[SPEAKER_18]: Will they stop using that?

1612
02:54:45,869 --> 02:54:47,890
[SPEAKER_18]: Will they stop purchasing cherry tomatoes?

1613
02:54:50,111 --> 02:54:51,352
[SPEAKER_18]: Portland was mentioned.

1614
02:54:52,312 --> 02:54:59,216
[SPEAKER_18]: Portland's mayor actually regrets passing a similar ordinance and said, made a serious mistake in judgment.

1615
02:55:01,437 --> 02:55:08,100
[SPEAKER_18]: My Jewish religion, my Jewish background tells me education is important.

1616
02:55:09,480 --> 02:55:10,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Definitions are important.

1617
02:55:11,818 --> 02:55:14,420
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, but Sudan is a genocide.

1618
02:55:14,720 --> 02:55:15,580
[SPEAKER_18]: Gaza is not.

1619
02:55:16,781 --> 02:55:20,744
[SPEAKER_18]: Gaza is a brutal and tragic war afflicting many.

1620
02:55:22,985 --> 02:55:30,270
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm sorry for all those who have lost family on both sides, but let's call it what it is.

1621
02:55:31,170 --> 02:55:34,772
[SPEAKER_18]: This is just a farce and concentrated attack on Israel.

1622
02:55:35,193 --> 02:55:35,493
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1623
02:55:42,558 --> 02:55:44,299
[SPEAKER_64]: We will return to the podium.

1624
02:55:46,260 --> 02:55:47,841
[SPEAKER_64]: Hello, my name's Maddie.

1625
02:55:47,941 --> 02:55:48,341
[SPEAKER_64]: Oh, sorry.

1626
02:55:49,302 --> 02:55:49,502
[SPEAKER_64]: Sorry.

1627
02:55:49,682 --> 02:55:50,082
[SPEAKER_64]: Go for it.

1628
02:55:50,482 --> 02:55:50,983
[SPEAKER_64]: You know the drill.

1629
02:55:51,503 --> 02:55:51,763
[SPEAKER_52]: Go ahead.

1630
02:55:52,283 --> 02:55:53,324
[SPEAKER_52]: Name and address for the record, please.

1631
02:55:53,524 --> 02:55:54,845
[SPEAKER_52]: Hello, my name's Matt Avon.

1632
02:55:55,065 --> 02:55:56,766
[SPEAKER_52]: I live at 59 Thomas Street.

1633
02:55:56,866 --> 02:55:57,946
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm a new resident to Medford.

1634
02:55:57,987 --> 02:55:59,227
[SPEAKER_52]: I just moved here a couple of weeks ago.

1635
02:55:59,948 --> 02:56:01,929
[SPEAKER_52]: I appreciate everybody bringing this up.

1636
02:56:02,089 --> 02:56:03,770
[SPEAKER_52]: I am in support of divestment.

1637
02:56:04,890 --> 02:56:11,034
[SPEAKER_52]: I am just going to go to an anecdotal story here because I am going to scratch what I just had.

1638
02:56:11,873 --> 02:56:13,494
[SPEAKER_52]: All right, so this is the story of Ahmed.

1639
02:56:13,955 --> 02:56:15,956
[SPEAKER_52]: Ahmed of Douma is 14 years old.

1640
02:56:16,237 --> 02:56:18,959
[SPEAKER_52]: His favorite sport is soccer, and his favorite team is Real Madrid.

1641
02:56:19,299 --> 02:56:21,681
[SPEAKER_52]: He loves going to school, and his favorite class is history.

1642
02:56:22,101 --> 02:56:25,044
[SPEAKER_52]: In many ways, Ahmed is just like any other young teen.

1643
02:56:25,384 --> 02:56:27,966
[SPEAKER_52]: His body language is stiff and a bit self-conscious.

1644
02:56:28,406 --> 02:56:30,708
[SPEAKER_52]: His vocal cadence is rushed and anticipatory.

1645
02:56:30,948 --> 02:56:35,812
[SPEAKER_52]: And best yet, the mustache sprouting up on his lip tells of a child who has not yet been taught to use a razor.

1646
02:56:36,172 --> 02:56:36,693
[SPEAKER_52]: I've been there too.

1647
02:56:37,213 --> 02:56:46,641
[SPEAKER_52]: But instead of a teen who is afforded the chance to come of age in pursuit of his own goals, Ahmed has been sentenced to a life of uncertainty, and this uncertainty is something he must navigate alone as he is an orphan.

1648
02:56:47,202 --> 02:56:52,707
[SPEAKER_52]: Ahmed was made an orphan at the age of four when his parents and infant brother were murdered by Israeli settlers in their sleep.

1649
02:56:53,187 --> 02:56:58,752
[SPEAKER_52]: Ten years ago, in 2015, and this is in the West Bank, the village of Douma was raided by settlers.

1650
02:56:59,092 --> 02:57:02,797
[SPEAKER_52]: They came by night, setting multiple homes ablaze while families slept inside.

1651
02:57:03,197 --> 02:57:04,619
[SPEAKER_52]: One of these families was Ahmed's.

1652
02:57:04,939 --> 02:57:10,006
[SPEAKER_52]: As the only survivor, he was saved by his neighbors, although he suffered multiple third-degree burns.

1653
02:57:10,626 --> 02:57:13,390
[SPEAKER_52]: I wrote this passage when I visited Ahmed in the West Bank.

1654
02:57:13,650 --> 02:57:14,691
[SPEAKER_52]: Here is a photo of him.

1655
02:57:15,072 --> 02:57:17,294
[SPEAKER_52]: You can see the third-degree burns that are to his face.

1656
02:57:17,935 --> 02:57:18,635
[SPEAKER_52]: All right.

1657
02:57:18,835 --> 02:57:29,420
[SPEAKER_52]: I have 600 other photos that I am happy to share with anyone up on this council to see what happens when you invest in companies that are complicit in the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people.

1658
02:57:29,680 --> 02:57:41,525
[SPEAKER_52]: And this is directly connected to fossil fuel companies because the Jordan Valley has been decimated by industrial agriculture that is both displacing the Palestinian population and suffocating the land.

1659
02:57:41,946 --> 02:57:43,046
[SPEAKER_52]: I have been in the Coast Guard.

1660
02:57:43,126 --> 02:57:44,567
[SPEAKER_52]: I spent five years in the Coast Guard.

1661
02:57:44,887 --> 02:57:46,267
[SPEAKER_52]: I worked search and rescue for three.

1662
02:57:46,287 --> 02:57:47,428
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm currently a paramedic.

1663
02:57:47,728 --> 02:57:53,050
[SPEAKER_52]: My entire life has been handling people on their worst days, and it has been nothing but a privilege.

1664
02:57:53,430 --> 02:57:59,472
[SPEAKER_52]: But the only things that seem to keep me up at night are these photos of children who are tethered in pieces.

1665
02:57:59,732 --> 02:58:00,973
[SPEAKER_52]: It's the kids like Ahmed.

1666
02:58:01,173 --> 02:58:04,054
[SPEAKER_52]: It's the school I visited in the village of Jalut.

1667
02:58:04,654 --> 02:58:14,938
[SPEAKER_52]: 200 kids were there, 5 to 18, stuffed in a building less than the size of this, and perched on the hilltop was a settler with a gun that was American-manufactured.

1668
02:58:15,438 --> 02:58:17,280
[SPEAKER_52]: That comes from our tax dollars.

1669
02:58:17,500 --> 02:58:21,623
[SPEAKER_52]: So even if this is just a symbolic move, it is a move in the right direction.

1670
02:58:21,863 --> 02:58:28,869
[SPEAKER_52]: And if you don't have the courage to stand up at even the most symbolic drop in the bucket gesture, then what are you doing in public office?

1671
02:58:29,289 --> 02:58:33,472
[SPEAKER_52]: I would rather wash my hands than pocket any blood money.

1672
02:58:33,813 --> 02:58:34,033
[SPEAKER_52]: I'm done.

1673
02:58:55,696 --> 02:58:56,977
[SPEAKER_19]: name and address for the record, please.

1674
02:58:57,898 --> 02:58:58,478
[SPEAKER_19]: Go ahead.

1675
02:58:59,639 --> 02:59:01,080
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Eileen Lerner.

1676
02:59:01,240 --> 02:59:04,302
[SPEAKER_19]: I live at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1677
02:59:04,843 --> 02:59:14,230
[SPEAKER_19]: And I want to thank the Council and particularly President Bears for bringing this values-based ordinance to the attention of the people of Medford

1678
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:26,243
[SPEAKER_19]: I am a representative of people power and I would like to let you all know that people power is solidly behind this ordinance.

1679
02:59:26,983 --> 02:59:35,445
[SPEAKER_19]: It reflects the values and the moral positions that we as an organization have taken.

1680
02:59:36,405 --> 02:59:38,526
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've also want to speak for myself.

1681
02:59:40,626 --> 02:59:43,347
[SPEAKER_19]: So I am the great granddaughter

1682
02:59:44,319 --> 02:59:48,100
[SPEAKER_19]: of people who were killed in Auschwitz.

1683
02:59:48,500 --> 02:59:52,482
[SPEAKER_19]: My whole family was killed in Auschwitz.

1684
02:59:53,422 --> 03:00:01,405
[SPEAKER_19]: Just my grandmother and my grandfather from his family escaped to come here and set up a new family.

1685
03:00:02,225 --> 03:00:08,547
[SPEAKER_19]: And yet I have sat here and been called, in effect, a terrorist.

1686
03:00:09,911 --> 03:00:22,076
[SPEAKER_19]: So the Jewish community here is not just the people who go to the synagogue, the Jewish community consists of many people who are secular Jews.

1687
03:00:24,049 --> 03:00:32,635
[SPEAKER_19]: And when we speak of the only Jews as Jews are the Jews that are organized and go to the synagogue, it is a grave error.

1688
03:00:32,815 --> 03:00:42,762
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that there are probably more Jewish people in Medford who are not going to the synagogue and are going to the synagogue, but we are not lesser Jews.

1689
03:00:43,943 --> 03:00:49,748
[SPEAKER_19]: We are the people who really understand what losing family means.

1690
03:00:50,733 --> 03:00:53,736
[SPEAKER_19]: We understand what inherited trauma is.

1691
03:00:54,876 --> 03:01:02,423
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I'm feeling it now just talking about my relatives and seeing what's happening in Gaza.

1692
03:01:04,661 --> 03:01:09,385
[SPEAKER_19]: is intolerable, intolerable, intolerable.

1693
03:01:10,166 --> 03:01:11,808
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't stand for it.

1694
03:01:11,888 --> 03:01:13,609
[SPEAKER_19]: We must do something.

1695
03:01:14,430 --> 03:01:17,092
[SPEAKER_19]: How can we let all these people starve?

1696
03:01:17,172 --> 03:01:19,434
[SPEAKER_19]: How can we let people be torn apart?

1697
03:01:19,494 --> 03:01:28,683
[SPEAKER_19]: How can we destroy universities and hospitals and homes and steal land from people?

1698
03:01:30,524 --> 03:01:33,768
[SPEAKER_19]: I have a cousin who no longer talks to me.

1699
03:01:34,228 --> 03:01:37,392
[SPEAKER_19]: He told me good riddance because of my stand.

1700
03:01:38,473 --> 03:01:46,683
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I say to him now, if you still support what's going on in Gaza, you are a Jewish Nazi.

1701
03:01:48,044 --> 03:01:49,646
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is my real opinion.

1702
03:01:50,942 --> 03:01:51,643
[SPEAKER_19]: Stop this.

1703
03:01:52,603 --> 03:01:56,707
[SPEAKER_19]: Stop this mad dash toward destruction.

1704
03:01:56,727 --> 03:02:14,221
[SPEAKER_19]: In every economic destruction, climate destruction, humanity destruction, we can no longer afford to back and to support and give our money to things that are killing people.

1705
03:02:14,961 --> 03:02:15,342
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1706
03:02:26,543 --> 03:02:27,844
[SPEAKER_69]: Name and address for the record, please.

1707
03:02:30,005 --> 03:02:30,526
[SPEAKER_34]: Good evening.

1708
03:02:30,886 --> 03:02:33,728
[SPEAKER_34]: My name is Barry Ingber, and I live at 9 Draper Street.

1709
03:02:33,828 --> 03:02:43,994
[SPEAKER_34]: And I'm speaking in total unequivocal support of this ordinance, which encompasses most of the concerns I have devoted my life to since the Vietnam War.

1710
03:02:45,856 --> 03:02:52,160
[SPEAKER_34]: In our present moment and thinking locally, I would prefer to speak about for-profit prisons and ICE detention centers.

1711
03:02:53,070 --> 03:02:58,915
[SPEAKER_34]: But because of the way this issue is playing out, I feel unable to address what I would prefer.

1712
03:02:59,215 --> 03:03:14,089
[SPEAKER_34]: And instead, I feel I need to address the weaponization of anti-Semitism in order to support a racist and genocidal nation state.

1713
03:03:15,109 --> 03:03:17,131
[SPEAKER_34]: This ordinance does not target Israel.

1714
03:03:17,672 --> 03:03:18,793
[SPEAKER_34]: It does not mention Israel.

1715
03:03:19,718 --> 03:03:27,465
[SPEAKER_34]: It could just as easily have been written in 1990 with not a word changed and be thought of as addressing South Africa.

1716
03:03:28,426 --> 03:03:34,892
[SPEAKER_34]: But the conversation about it, frankly, from both supporters and opponents, has been about Israel and about Jews.

1717
03:03:35,452 --> 03:03:38,935
[SPEAKER_34]: So, okay, let's talk about Israel and Jews.

1718
03:03:40,176 --> 03:03:40,757
[SPEAKER_34]: I am a Jew.

1719
03:03:42,105 --> 03:03:43,465
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm a somewhat observant Jew.

1720
03:03:43,606 --> 03:03:49,287
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm even a congregational Jew who goes to synagogue sometimes, active in a synagogue.

1721
03:03:49,968 --> 03:03:52,809
[SPEAKER_34]: I observe the holidays in as many mitzvot as I can.

1722
03:03:53,289 --> 03:03:56,570
[SPEAKER_34]: The yarmulke I am wearing now gets regular use.

1723
03:03:57,530 --> 03:03:59,091
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm also anti-Zionist.

1724
03:03:59,811 --> 03:04:05,373
[SPEAKER_34]: I take tremendous affront when people defend Israel under the pretext of defending me.

1725
03:04:06,202 --> 03:04:13,066
[SPEAKER_34]: These people do not speak for me, no matter how many times they claim to represent Jews or the Jewish community.

1726
03:04:13,667 --> 03:04:15,468
[SPEAKER_34]: Their arguments do not make me safe.

1727
03:04:15,868 --> 03:04:17,109
[SPEAKER_34]: They make me unsafe.

1728
03:04:17,989 --> 03:04:23,453
[SPEAKER_34]: Unsafe because they echo and reinforce the old anti-Semitic dual loyalty trope.

1729
03:04:24,714 --> 03:04:33,619
[SPEAKER_34]: Unsafe because they link me to, and therefore implicitly make me responsible for, the most horrific war crimes of the past 25 years.

1730
03:04:36,011 --> 03:04:45,339
[SPEAKER_34]: The defense of Israel giving a nation state primacy over the values and Talmudic teachings I hold dear is also idolatrous.

1731
03:04:47,841 --> 03:04:51,604
[SPEAKER_34]: Changing gears here, I like the revisions made to the ordinance.

1732
03:04:51,665 --> 03:04:53,406
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, President Bears.

1733
03:04:53,826 --> 03:04:57,670
[SPEAKER_34]: But I want to call attention to one small edit that I find highly problematic.

1734
03:04:58,717 --> 03:05:05,600
[SPEAKER_34]: Any diversified investment portfolio will try to balance domestic with international investments and equity with debt investments.

1735
03:05:06,220 --> 03:05:11,182
[SPEAKER_34]: So we're going to be invested in foreign bonds, and a portion of those will be government bonds.

1736
03:05:11,922 --> 03:05:28,328
[SPEAKER_34]: By deleting the words or entity in paragraph D, we are permitting investments in sovereign bonds of nations that engage in serious human rights abuses, such as those issued by Morocco, China, Russia, El Salvador, and yes, Israel.

1737
03:05:29,046 --> 03:05:31,367
[SPEAKER_34]: those two words need to be restored.

1738
03:05:32,167 --> 03:05:32,567
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1739
03:05:41,691 --> 03:05:57,197
[SPEAKER_56]: Hi, my name is Paulette Buckheim and I'm actually, I live in Malden, but I've exchanged some emails with President Bears about this particular wording of

1740
03:05:58,717 --> 03:05:59,438
[SPEAKER_56]: the ordinance.

1741
03:06:00,818 --> 03:06:15,464
[SPEAKER_56]: You're close, but close isn't really good enough because unlike individuals or companies, cities and states have a specific fiduciary obligation.

1742
03:06:15,724 --> 03:06:18,205
[SPEAKER_56]: They're just not investing money for themselves.

1743
03:06:18,525 --> 03:06:21,446
[SPEAKER_56]: They're investing money for the whole community.

1744
03:06:21,906 --> 03:06:24,807
[SPEAKER_56]: So when you do things, you need to make sure

1745
03:06:25,175 --> 03:06:34,737
[SPEAKER_56]: you're following all the laws, that you're not going to put your city, your state, the people who were trusting you with their money at risk.

1746
03:06:35,617 --> 03:06:38,277
[SPEAKER_56]: There's some questions about this ordinance.

1747
03:06:39,498 --> 03:06:48,939
[SPEAKER_56]: One, constitutionally, can cities, you know, they don't have the purview to actually make foreign policy.

1748
03:06:48,979 --> 03:06:51,100
[SPEAKER_56]: Could this be considered foreign policy?

1749
03:06:51,620 --> 03:06:53,240
[SPEAKER_56]: We're living in the Trump era.

1750
03:06:54,000 --> 03:07:08,107
[SPEAKER_56]: And we don't know what can happen, like the other day, the Trump administration has said that any city or state that does BDS which is basically is by everybody who's been talking.

1751
03:07:09,508 --> 03:07:19,352
[SPEAKER_56]: No more FEMA, which is also other things besides in case of a tornado or flood or something, but it's also readiness for an administration.

1752
03:07:19,833 --> 03:07:20,033
[SPEAKER_56]: So,

1753
03:07:21,013 --> 03:07:22,714
[SPEAKER_56]: What else could be happening?

1754
03:07:22,734 --> 03:07:27,676
[SPEAKER_56]: Will the Trump DOJ come down on these things?

1755
03:07:27,896 --> 03:07:31,538
[SPEAKER_56]: There's some real risks to what the city is doing.

1756
03:07:32,078 --> 03:07:36,660
[SPEAKER_56]: And it's important that you take a look at this legally.

1757
03:07:37,600 --> 03:07:40,761
[SPEAKER_56]: The mayor probably will not sign this.

1758
03:07:40,862 --> 03:07:44,223
[SPEAKER_56]: So you're passing an ordinance that the mayor will not

1759
03:07:44,841 --> 03:07:47,102
[SPEAKER_56]: actually sign or go with?

1760
03:07:47,562 --> 03:07:52,923
[SPEAKER_56]: So are you just spinning wheels or how can you do this so it's better?

1761
03:07:53,403 --> 03:07:59,504
[SPEAKER_56]: So that you're really helping people as well as fitting in with your own guidance.

1762
03:08:00,025 --> 03:08:06,546
[SPEAKER_56]: And if you turn around and all the people that have said, and for the people who have said, oh my God, this is not about Israel.

1763
03:08:06,586 --> 03:08:08,747
[SPEAKER_56]: This is not about antisemitism.

1764
03:08:09,367 --> 03:08:11,707
[SPEAKER_56]: I mean, we're getting it on all sides.

1765
03:08:11,727 --> 03:08:14,108
[SPEAKER_56]: We're getting people questioning how, you know,

1766
03:08:14,528 --> 03:08:16,429
[SPEAKER_56]: are, what kind of Jew you are?

1767
03:08:16,449 --> 03:08:18,929
[SPEAKER_56]: I mean, that's a million dollar question.

1768
03:08:20,410 --> 03:08:24,971
[SPEAKER_56]: You know, so this is not bringing the community together with values.

1769
03:08:25,371 --> 03:08:26,552
[SPEAKER_56]: It's dividing people.

1770
03:08:26,812 --> 03:08:28,873
[SPEAKER_56]: It's making people feel uncomfortable.

1771
03:08:29,293 --> 03:08:32,414
[SPEAKER_56]: It's making me question, should I shop in Medford?

1772
03:08:32,454 --> 03:08:39,496
[SPEAKER_56]: Should I, you know, because just like you have the opportunity to invest, I can shop wherever I want to.

1773
03:08:39,616 --> 03:08:40,996
[SPEAKER_56]: I tend to shop in Medford.

1774
03:08:41,256 --> 03:08:42,417
[SPEAKER_56]: Maybe I won't because

1775
03:08:43,057 --> 03:08:46,502
[SPEAKER_56]: of the people, you know, the community and the values that I see.

1776
03:08:46,782 --> 03:08:48,545
[SPEAKER_56]: So these things are important as well.

1777
03:08:48,565 --> 03:08:48,785
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you.

1778
03:08:48,805 --> 03:08:49,146
[SPEAKER_56]: That's time.

1779
03:08:49,686 --> 03:08:50,327
[SPEAKER_56]: Thank you for your time.

1780
03:08:55,194 --> 03:08:56,396
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1781
03:08:56,456 --> 03:08:57,117
[SPEAKER_64]: You have three minutes.

1782
03:08:58,133 --> 03:09:02,539
[SPEAKER_47]: My name is Bryce York and I live on 70 Lakeside Drive in Groton, Massachusetts.

1783
03:09:02,559 --> 03:09:16,476
[SPEAKER_47]: And while I may not be a resident of Medford, I'm speaking today because I believe that this ordinance being successful could encourage more cities and towns across the state like my own to either divest or to discourage them from investing in these companies in the future.

1784
03:09:17,277 --> 03:09:24,659
[SPEAKER_47]: Additionally, the issues raised by this ordinance are not only issues that affect Medford, they are issues that affect the planet that every one of us lives on.

1785
03:09:25,259 --> 03:09:31,341
[SPEAKER_47]: I recognize that rapid change can be scary, but the companies you would be divesting from are not waiting for you.

1786
03:09:31,761 --> 03:09:34,822
[SPEAKER_47]: The last 10 summers have been the 10 hottest summers on record.

1787
03:09:35,202 --> 03:09:41,724
[SPEAKER_47]: The people of Hawaii and Los Angeles, among many other places, have been victim to wildfires and did not have time on their side.

1788
03:09:42,258 --> 03:09:49,009
[SPEAKER_47]: And disasters like those wildfires will only continue as fossil fuels companies worsen climate change more and more.

1789
03:09:49,029 --> 03:09:56,240
[SPEAKER_47]: There are island nations that may cease to exist within my lifetime due to the rising sea level as the ice caps melt further.

1790
03:09:57,240 --> 03:10:15,367
[SPEAKER_47]: Furthermore, hearing people imply that international organizations such as the UN are biased against Israel while Israel has routinely shown that they are a nation with no respect for ceasefires, violating one on numerous occasions and having no respect for international law even

1791
03:10:15,867 --> 03:10:18,648
[SPEAKER_47]: firing upon a U.N.

1792
03:10:18,829 --> 03:10:21,510
[SPEAKER_47]: peacekeeping site is disgusting.

1793
03:10:22,250 --> 03:10:27,153
[SPEAKER_47]: People may think that the Israel-Palestine conflict does not affect them, but they would be wrong.

1794
03:10:27,633 --> 03:10:27,953
[SPEAKER_47]: A U.N.

1795
03:10:27,993 --> 03:10:34,317
[SPEAKER_47]: report in March 2024 had found that 60,000 tons of sewage were being discharged into the Mediterranean Sea

1796
03:10:34,817 --> 03:10:40,001
[SPEAKER_47]: per day with no reason to believe that it would have been higher that month in particular.

1797
03:10:40,921 --> 03:10:46,525
[SPEAKER_47]: As a child living in Massachusetts, I was proud to find out that Massachusetts was the first state to abolish slavery.

1798
03:10:46,565 --> 03:10:49,647
[SPEAKER_47]: So give the future children of Medford something to be proud of their city.

1799
03:10:49,667 --> 03:10:52,269
[SPEAKER_63]: Thank you.

1800
03:10:58,290 --> 03:10:59,611
[SPEAKER_64]: Can you address for the record, please?

1801
03:10:59,911 --> 03:11:01,493
[SPEAKER_76]: Hey, my name is Rahaf Suleiman.

1802
03:11:01,573 --> 03:11:14,903
[SPEAKER_76]: I'm a resident of Medford, and I'm here in support of the divestment on the behalf of my family, my 85-year-old grandmother, who was here earlier, who's a neck brace survivor.

1803
03:11:15,483 --> 03:11:24,590
[SPEAKER_76]: And on the behalf of my niece and nephews, who were here earlier making a mass, who kids in their age and guns are being bombed into pieces.

1804
03:11:25,110 --> 03:11:26,792
[SPEAKER_76]: Some of them are lost under the rubble.

1805
03:11:28,683 --> 03:11:33,146
[SPEAKER_76]: And we're here to say that we exist and we will always exist.

1806
03:11:33,807 --> 03:11:37,329
[SPEAKER_76]: We will always exist to fight for this.

1807
03:11:38,210 --> 03:11:55,922
[SPEAKER_76]: And to speak for this gentleman who said we're terrorists, I would like to tell him that we're the only terrorists in this story is Israel committing genocide against the people, making us feel uncomfortable about it.

1808
03:12:00,876 --> 03:12:16,283
[SPEAKER_76]: I urge you to divest and invest the money and our tax money into this country rather than foreign countries who are committing war crimes according to International Court of Justice.

1809
03:12:16,764 --> 03:12:17,084
[SPEAKER_76]: Thank you.

1810
03:12:26,486 --> 03:12:27,627
[SPEAKER_64]: I'm gonna address for the record, please.

1811
03:12:27,867 --> 03:12:28,708
[SPEAKER_05]: You have three minutes.

1812
03:12:29,048 --> 03:12:29,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1813
03:12:30,509 --> 03:12:35,793
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Fern Rometty Brown, and I live at 21 Ivy Road in Malden.

1814
03:12:36,394 --> 03:12:37,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for allowing me to speak.

1815
03:12:38,816 --> 03:12:52,606
[SPEAKER_05]: As a resident of Malden, who just last year went through a divisive ceasefire resolution decision, and having witnessed rising and normalized antisemitism, I speak against this resolution for several reasons.

1816
03:12:53,907 --> 03:12:57,971
[SPEAKER_05]: People here are saying that anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism.

1817
03:12:58,592 --> 03:13:08,241
[SPEAKER_05]: They are deeply linked because I have experienced heckling, being called horrific names, being threatened because I am a pro-Israel Jew.

1818
03:13:09,202 --> 03:13:12,185
[SPEAKER_05]: People have said, I thought you cared about social justice.

1819
03:13:13,026 --> 03:13:24,653
[SPEAKER_05]: As a lifelong progressive, the child of a Holocaust survivor who has lost all of his entire family, a lesbian, and a mother, I have only fought for social justice my entire life.

1820
03:13:25,653 --> 03:13:35,759
[SPEAKER_05]: It is disingenuous to lump together fossil fuels, private prisons, and divesting from Israel, citing Gaza without even mentioning Israel.

1821
03:13:38,861 --> 03:13:42,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Israel is the indigenous homeland of the Jewish people.

1822
03:13:43,071 --> 03:13:49,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Zionism is the intention of Jews to self-govern in its indigenous homeland.

1823
03:13:50,394 --> 03:13:58,477
[SPEAKER_05]: As distinct from popular belief, it is impossible to separate anti-Zionism from anti-Semitism in this proposal.

1824
03:13:59,617 --> 03:14:02,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Genocide is the intended destruction of a people.

1825
03:14:03,600 --> 03:14:16,571
[SPEAKER_05]: Israel is focused on getting its hostages back, not intended destruction, relying on tick tock to educate oneself does not mean that you understand facts numbers or history.

1826
03:14:17,352 --> 03:14:23,016
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I would argue that it focuses on sensationalism to the point of obscuring reality.

1827
03:14:24,237 --> 03:14:35,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone who mentions Gaza here says nothing about Hamas, which is the reason that terrorism has been enacted, not only on Israel, but on Gaza citizens as well.

1828
03:14:37,107 --> 03:14:51,097
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are actually focused on preventing genocide and human rights violations, why not do some actual research and focus on Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Afghanistan?

1829
03:14:51,677 --> 03:14:59,158
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're talking about boycotting a country that we deal with regularly, why not focus on China, where human rights violations are well known?

1830
03:15:00,579 --> 03:15:08,920
[SPEAKER_05]: My point is that it is illogical to include boycotting a country when you have no idea what you will be denying to your community.

1831
03:15:09,520 --> 03:15:16,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you also boycott Waze GPS, vaccines, and modern medicine and technology that improve and save our lives?

1832
03:15:18,022 --> 03:15:18,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are all

1833
03:15:20,020 --> 03:15:22,021
[SPEAKER_05]: those all originate from Israel.

1834
03:15:22,841 --> 03:15:31,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I strongly suggest that the fossil fuels and private prisons be separated from the highly politicized topic of Israel and Gaza.

1835
03:15:32,185 --> 03:15:34,066
[SPEAKER_05]: The way to do that, it's time?

1836
03:15:34,406 --> 03:15:34,726
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time.

1837
03:15:35,467 --> 03:15:36,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just finish?

1838
03:15:37,027 --> 03:15:37,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Finish your thought.

1839
03:15:37,808 --> 03:15:38,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1840
03:15:38,768 --> 03:15:46,892
[SPEAKER_05]: The way to do that is to delete paragraph D and mention paragraph D and any mention of paragraph D in paragraph E. Thank you.

1841
03:15:52,358 --> 03:15:53,499
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1842
03:15:53,840 --> 03:15:54,060
[SPEAKER_64]: Thanks.

1843
03:15:54,180 --> 03:15:55,321
[SPEAKER_55]: My name is Benjamin Stein.

1844
03:15:55,361 --> 03:15:56,623
[SPEAKER_55]: I live at 38 Sturgis Street.

1845
03:15:56,643 --> 03:15:58,885
[SPEAKER_55]: I want to thank President Bears for bringing this ordinance.

1846
03:15:59,305 --> 03:16:03,410
[SPEAKER_55]: As a Jewish member of this community, I want to speak in full support of this ordinance.

1847
03:16:04,308 --> 03:16:06,549
[SPEAKER_55]: The city should invest our tax dollars sustainably.

1848
03:16:06,649 --> 03:16:14,972
[SPEAKER_55]: I don't want my money to support investment in fossil fuel companies, weapons manufacturers, prisons, and companies knowingly contributing to human rights violations.

1849
03:16:15,352 --> 03:16:16,732
[SPEAKER_55]: It is morally reprehensible.

1850
03:16:17,332 --> 03:16:26,776
[SPEAKER_55]: We have a responsibility to our community, to our future, to invest our tax dollars responsibly and in ways that align with our values.

1851
03:16:28,396 --> 03:16:35,838
[SPEAKER_55]: I am really disheartened to hear the ways in which Jewish identity has been weaponized in what I see as an anti-Semitic way.

1852
03:16:37,659 --> 03:16:41,300
[SPEAKER_55]: And I've been very heartened to hear a lot of the great comments from other folks tonight.

1853
03:16:41,380 --> 03:16:43,220
[SPEAKER_55]: So thank you, President Bears.

1854
03:16:43,260 --> 03:16:45,061
[SPEAKER_55]: I fully support this ordinance.

1855
03:16:51,743 --> 03:16:52,923
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1856
03:16:53,915 --> 03:16:56,697
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi, Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street.

1857
03:16:57,097 --> 03:17:06,583
[SPEAKER_36]: I want to thank President Bears and the rest of the council for having this resolution up for consideration.

1858
03:17:07,363 --> 03:17:11,706
[SPEAKER_36]: I fully support it, and I want to voice my enthusiastic support for it.

1859
03:17:14,067 --> 03:17:16,249
[SPEAKER_36]: You can't be neutral on a moving train.

1860
03:17:16,409 --> 03:17:20,291
[SPEAKER_36]: I think Howard Zinn famously said that, maybe, title of book.

1861
03:17:22,096 --> 03:17:22,696
[SPEAKER_36]: under that name.

1862
03:17:23,117 --> 03:17:24,938
[SPEAKER_36]: Capitalism is destroying our planet.

1863
03:17:25,438 --> 03:17:31,501
[SPEAKER_36]: I appreciate the small step to divest from the bleeding edge of that destruction.

1864
03:17:31,521 --> 03:17:35,624
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, weapons, private prisons, fossil fuels.

1865
03:17:36,464 --> 03:17:47,671
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, we see ourselves right now, or our community right now sees, you know, members, you know, being rounded up by ICE and detained in these private prisons.

1866
03:17:48,151 --> 03:17:51,473
[SPEAKER_36]: I certainly believe that we should have no financial stake in that.

1867
03:17:53,845 --> 03:17:56,406
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, I am Jewish.

1868
03:17:56,746 --> 03:18:02,830
[SPEAKER_36]: I, like many others, want to express my dismay at the conflation of anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism.

1869
03:18:04,932 --> 03:18:16,959
[SPEAKER_36]: In 1948, Albert Einstein and Hannah Arendt, along with other Jewish public intellectuals, wrote an open letter to the New York Times.

1870
03:18:19,284 --> 03:18:31,431
[SPEAKER_36]: decried the newly founded Freedom Party, which was, quote, a political party closely akin in its organization, methods, political philosophy, and social appeal to the Nazi and fascist parties.

1871
03:18:32,051 --> 03:18:34,052
[SPEAKER_36]: They cautioned Americans against supporting it.

1872
03:18:35,293 --> 03:18:37,895
[SPEAKER_36]: That party was founded by Menachem Begin.

1873
03:18:38,695 --> 03:18:42,097
[SPEAKER_36]: Menachem Begin, some years later, went on to found Likud.

1874
03:18:42,860 --> 03:18:49,182
[SPEAKER_36]: That is the current party that is in charge of the state of Israel that Benjamin Netanyahu hails from.

1875
03:18:49,662 --> 03:18:53,183
[SPEAKER_36]: And I don't mean to suggest that there's a fair way to have an ethno-state.

1876
03:18:54,084 --> 03:18:55,244
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't think that's the case.

1877
03:18:55,324 --> 03:19:05,888
[SPEAKER_36]: But I do want to make clear that from Israel's earliest days, there were strong fascistic, anti-democratic, ethno-supremacist currents at play.

1878
03:19:06,588 --> 03:19:08,128
[SPEAKER_36]: They are dominant there today.

1879
03:19:08,548 --> 03:19:10,189
[SPEAKER_36]: And the government of Benjamin Netanyahu

1880
03:19:10,877 --> 03:19:16,538
[SPEAKER_36]: And they were clearly recognized back around its founding.

1881
03:19:18,239 --> 03:19:21,840
[SPEAKER_36]: I believe this fascist government is pushing a deeply pernicious narrative.

1882
03:19:22,060 --> 03:19:22,960
[SPEAKER_36]: I do not support it.

1883
03:19:23,040 --> 03:19:30,222
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't support the attitude that anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are one and the same.

1884
03:19:30,522 --> 03:19:33,042
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm an anti-Zionist Jew.

1885
03:19:33,062 --> 03:19:34,263
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm proud of that.

1886
03:19:36,495 --> 03:19:43,080
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think at this late hour, it's really important that we recognize that this genocide has moved into, you know, its final solution.

1887
03:19:44,221 --> 03:19:51,427
[SPEAKER_36]: After the destruction of houses, hospitals, clean water, sewage, and virtually every other form of civilian public health infrastructure,

1888
03:19:52,147 --> 03:19:58,671
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, we're now seeing this mass starvation, this perverse, sadistic hunger gains type stuff.

1889
03:20:00,072 --> 03:20:04,314
[SPEAKER_36]: So just to be clear, you know, thank you for putting this forward.

1890
03:20:04,694 --> 03:20:12,378
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm sorry, there's a hand on Zoom.

1891
03:20:12,398 --> 03:20:14,159
[SPEAKER_64]: So we're going to pause the podium for just a sec.

1892
03:20:15,260 --> 03:20:16,781
[SPEAKER_64]: Michael, I'm going to ask to unmute you.

1893
03:20:16,841 --> 03:20:18,381
[SPEAKER_64]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1894
03:20:18,401 --> 03:20:19,222
[SPEAKER_64]: And you'll have three minutes.

1895
03:20:23,843 --> 03:20:26,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, Michael Dewberry, 50 Park Street.

1896
03:20:28,045 --> 03:20:30,907
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you to the council for considering this resolution.

1897
03:20:30,967 --> 03:20:33,008
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in full support of it.

1898
03:20:33,968 --> 03:20:42,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Many residents have already spoken eloquently about the individual components of our values-based investing.

1899
03:20:43,013 --> 03:20:47,455
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted, and I'm not gonna try to improve on any of those statements.

1900
03:20:47,875 --> 03:20:48,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I just will make a personal,

1901
03:20:49,716 --> 03:20:51,677
[SPEAKER_11]: statement in favor of values-based investing.

1902
03:20:52,518 --> 03:20:59,022
[SPEAKER_11]: My wife and I were lucky enough to have a provider that allowed us to set that up last year.

1903
03:20:59,482 --> 03:21:07,427
[SPEAKER_11]: And the process was not only relatively straightforward, it was very satisfying to finally realize that our

1904
03:21:08,375 --> 03:21:10,896
[SPEAKER_11]: labor was going to things that were in line with our values.

1905
03:21:12,616 --> 03:21:25,901
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just think that's something that we should definitely have on a municipal scale to allow, you know, everyone to democratically use our values to decide, you know, what our money supports and what we profit from.

1906
03:21:26,441 --> 03:21:29,802
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, again, yeah, thank you for considering this ordinance, full support.

1907
03:21:29,822 --> 03:21:32,983
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you to everyone who spoke so eloquently in favor previous to me.

1908
03:21:33,343 --> 03:21:33,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1909
03:21:39,662 --> 03:21:40,202
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Michael.

1910
03:21:40,222 --> 03:21:41,203
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll turn to the podium.

1911
03:21:41,363 --> 03:21:42,604
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1912
03:21:42,884 --> 03:21:44,665
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Karam Habiballah.

1913
03:21:44,785 --> 03:21:49,568
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Malden resident, and I would like to thank you all for giving me and the others a chance to speak.

1914
03:21:50,652 --> 03:22:11,231
[SPEAKER_00]: I fully support the ordinance for the simple fact that continuing to fund the Israeli government or its companies while it engages in actions that have led to widespread civilian harm, displacement, starvation, and allegations of human rights violations, it makes us complicit in injustice.

1915
03:22:11,792 --> 03:22:14,735
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a city, as a citizen, and as a human being,

1916
03:22:15,662 --> 03:22:28,776
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have the responsibility to ensure our public dollars do not contribute to the suffering of others, no matter what they this ordinance is not about religion or politics.

1917
03:22:29,416 --> 03:22:30,678
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about accountability.

1918
03:22:31,158 --> 03:22:38,606
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about using our collective voice to say that we will not stand by silently while war crimes, including

1919
03:22:39,150 --> 03:22:49,032
[SPEAKER_00]: that deliberate deprivation of food, water, medical aid are committed, we should instead invest it in causes that align with human dignity, both here and abroad.

1920
03:22:49,192 --> 03:22:54,733
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter where we invest it, as long as we do not invest it in killing and starving people.

1921
03:22:55,053 --> 03:22:55,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1922
03:22:57,994 --> 03:22:58,934
[SPEAKER_00]: And free Palestine.

1923
03:22:58,954 --> 03:23:03,375
[SPEAKER_64]: All right.

1924
03:23:06,596 --> 03:23:07,816
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1925
03:23:07,856 --> 03:23:08,456
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

1926
03:23:12,830 --> 03:23:17,454
[SPEAKER_41]: Ezekiel Silverstein, 71 Kenmare Road in Medford.

1927
03:23:17,474 --> 03:23:20,196
[SPEAKER_41]: I want to speak against this ordinance.

1928
03:23:20,516 --> 03:23:23,598
[SPEAKER_41]: This ordinance is legally questionable and morally dubious.

1929
03:23:24,119 --> 03:23:31,865
[SPEAKER_41]: The mayor, the Medford Retirement Board, and outside legal counsel have all raised their concern regarding the feasibility and implementation of this ordinance.

1930
03:23:32,565 --> 03:23:38,447
[SPEAKER_41]: Medford's finances are already strained with the new fire station to build and salaries and city improvements to fund.

1931
03:23:39,127 --> 03:23:48,169
[SPEAKER_41]: Attempting to make this potentially illegal and financially irresponsible decision like this to divest from high returning funds and companies is a facially political act.

1932
03:23:48,709 --> 03:23:59,112
[SPEAKER_41]: To politicize our city's financial well-being for political means is a dereliction of fiduciary and representative duty to your local Medford constituents.

1933
03:23:59,932 --> 03:24:06,496
[SPEAKER_41]: I question why the council is investing precious time and capital on this vaguely worded and overly broad ordinance.

1934
03:24:08,137 --> 03:24:21,584
[SPEAKER_41]: I don't foresee Medford entirely divesting from companies that do work in China due to their atrocities, from the United Kingdom due to their colonization of Northern Ireland, or from even the United States for our questionable LGBTQ policies.

1935
03:24:23,105 --> 03:24:24,966
[SPEAKER_41]: To do so would be financially obtuse.

1936
03:24:25,881 --> 03:24:31,923
[SPEAKER_41]: For many other speakers tonight, though, it is clear to see why some members of this council are trying to force through this ordinance.

1937
03:24:33,363 --> 03:24:53,010
[SPEAKER_41]: We would like all to see the war to end in all war around the world, but labeling 80 plus percent of Jewish worldwide community as genocide heirs or supporters is shameful, blood libel, and Holocaust inversion in a war that Hamas started and refuses to end by returning the hostages.

1938
03:24:54,619 --> 03:25:00,204
[SPEAKER_41]: The hate we face is real, as seen here tonight and throughout our town.

1939
03:25:00,784 --> 03:25:05,348
[SPEAKER_41]: Medford recently saw horrific graffiti at the MBTA Harvard Street bus stop on July 21st.

1940
03:25:05,448 --> 03:25:10,893
[SPEAKER_41]: It equated Jews with Nazis and had symbology that supports terrorist organizations.

1941
03:25:11,753 --> 03:25:13,655
[SPEAKER_41]: This graffiti was shockingly anti-Semitic.

1942
03:25:14,676 --> 03:25:19,120
[SPEAKER_41]: Targeting Medford's Jewish community would never be acceptable, but that is what we see here tonight.

1943
03:25:20,180 --> 03:25:35,696
[SPEAKER_41]: Numerous Medford residents, as well as local chapters of the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, and the Jewish Community Relations Council have all sent letters to this council emphasizing how divisive and harmful passage of this ordinance will be received.

1944
03:25:36,573 --> 03:25:46,404
[SPEAKER_41]: Regardless of any other comments tonight, I, my family, and my community feel less safe in unseen because of the graffiti statements in ordinances like these.

1945
03:25:47,305 --> 03:25:55,474
[SPEAKER_41]: There are some worthwhile ideas in this ordinance, especially regarding private prisons, but it is too broad, too vague, covering too many subjects.

1946
03:25:56,175 --> 03:25:59,796
[SPEAKER_41]: I find it difficult to see how this ordinance helps the city of Medford and its residents.

1947
03:26:00,376 --> 03:26:07,837
[SPEAKER_41]: It is an ideological act that would result in harms to our financial well-being at the expense of a local religious and ethnic minority community.

1948
03:26:08,517 --> 03:26:10,838
[SPEAKER_41]: Moral posturing like this is best left to others.

1949
03:26:11,318 --> 03:26:12,758
[SPEAKER_41]: Reject this divisive ordinance.

1950
03:26:13,018 --> 03:26:13,318
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1951
03:26:14,318 --> 03:26:15,019
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you, Ezekiel.

1952
03:26:21,080 --> 03:26:22,180
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1953
03:26:22,909 --> 03:26:23,589
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1954
03:26:23,709 --> 03:26:26,110
[SPEAKER_20]: That's Sunphere 61, Stingney Road.

1955
03:26:26,310 --> 03:26:27,250
[SPEAKER_20]: So I spoke three times.

1956
03:26:27,770 --> 03:26:28,871
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't want to repeat myself.

1957
03:26:29,051 --> 03:26:39,473
[SPEAKER_20]: So I still want to state that I oppose this ordinance as written based on the facts that it is against our national security, the national security of the United States.

1958
03:26:40,194 --> 03:26:42,194
[SPEAKER_20]: And it is bad for me, for finances.

1959
03:26:42,754 --> 03:26:48,936
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to commend President Bayers for having worked on the ordinance since the first time.

1960
03:26:49,736 --> 03:27:09,108
[SPEAKER_20]: And second time, in particular, on the first time that I spoke, I suggested an evidence based study of realistic sustainability criteria and I was happy to see that now there's a section where the treasure collector is supposed to follow the MSCI ESG controversies and global norms screen.

1961
03:27:10,558 --> 03:27:21,088
[SPEAKER_20]: So I had a question related to that, because unfortunately I wasn't able to spend the amount of time that I wanted on this audience, and I know that President Bayers is the expert.

1962
03:27:22,129 --> 03:27:32,357
[SPEAKER_20]: So when I did a quick research on that screen, and I tried to screen Lockheed Martin, Lockheed Martin passes the screen.

1963
03:27:33,257 --> 03:27:41,844
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm confused as to how this ESG methodology or screener is supposed to work.

1964
03:27:42,084 --> 03:27:52,953
[SPEAKER_20]: Obviously, then it says we're supposed to still abide by section 2697A through D, which would prevent the city from investing in Lockheed Martin.

1965
03:27:53,674 --> 03:27:54,835
[SPEAKER_20]: But then what's the point?

1966
03:27:55,555 --> 03:27:56,695
[SPEAKER_20]: of the ESG screener.

1967
03:27:56,975 --> 03:28:04,078
[SPEAKER_20]: So is it just like a placeholder so we can say like, oh, we're supposed to follow an ESG screener?

1968
03:28:04,898 --> 03:28:08,159
[SPEAKER_20]: Or am I incorrect in, again, my quick research?

1969
03:28:08,199 --> 03:28:13,761
[SPEAKER_20]: So I was wondering whether President Bears could speak to this to clarify.

1970
03:28:14,101 --> 03:28:16,021
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just curious as to how it works.

1971
03:28:16,321 --> 03:28:17,002
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1972
03:28:17,462 --> 03:28:17,762
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

1973
03:28:20,683 --> 03:28:24,404
[SPEAKER_64]: And councillors will have the opportunity to respond at their discretion after public comment.

1974
03:28:26,117 --> 03:28:27,257
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

1975
03:28:27,538 --> 03:28:28,078
[SPEAKER_64]: No, three minutes.

1976
03:28:29,058 --> 03:28:30,899
[SPEAKER_38]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

1977
03:28:31,439 --> 03:28:34,840
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not going to be any surprise to any of you sitting behind the rail that I'm opposed to this.

1978
03:28:35,160 --> 03:28:36,821
[SPEAKER_38]: I have said it twice in the past.

1979
03:28:37,721 --> 03:28:44,524
[SPEAKER_38]: It's kind of funny how there was a meeting tonight, and we're once again talking about a very divisive issue.

1980
03:28:45,484 --> 03:28:52,307
[SPEAKER_38]: At the same time, literally from 5 to 8 p.m., there was a really nice event happening in the city that was unifying.

1981
03:28:52,347 --> 03:28:53,467
[SPEAKER_38]: It was the National Night Out.

1982
03:28:55,545 --> 03:28:58,929
[SPEAKER_38]: And a councillor can roll his eyes at me and I suppose it's a free country so we can do that.

1983
03:28:58,949 --> 03:28:59,850
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you councillor Levin.

1984
03:29:00,571 --> 03:29:01,933
[SPEAKER_38]: Please direct your comments to the chair.

1985
03:29:02,434 --> 03:29:03,795
[SPEAKER_38]: Sure, enforce the rules for everyone.

1986
03:29:04,977 --> 03:29:06,398
[SPEAKER_38]: So that's an even handedly please.

1987
03:29:06,919 --> 03:29:09,162
[SPEAKER_38]: So I get my time and I can use it.

1988
03:29:10,278 --> 03:29:11,458
[SPEAKER_38]: You're dividing the community.

1989
03:29:11,778 --> 03:29:14,039
[SPEAKER_38]: Again, you had a wonderful event.

1990
03:29:14,059 --> 03:29:15,359
[SPEAKER_38]: It was a nice family event.

1991
03:29:15,839 --> 03:29:22,321
[SPEAKER_38]: I got to sit there and show my kids that, you know, police officers are people just like the rest of us.

1992
03:29:22,761 --> 03:29:26,362
[SPEAKER_38]: And none of them would ever want to discharge their weapon on someone unless they had to.

1993
03:29:27,202 --> 03:29:28,682
[SPEAKER_38]: Their job is to serve and protect.

1994
03:29:30,163 --> 03:29:31,543
[SPEAKER_38]: They can't do that with bubbles.

1995
03:29:31,923 --> 03:29:32,723
[SPEAKER_38]: I wish they could.

1996
03:29:32,943 --> 03:29:33,964
[SPEAKER_38]: Everyone wishes they could.

1997
03:29:34,324 --> 03:29:37,985
[SPEAKER_38]: There isn't a person in this room that wants to see anyone get hurt, especially the paramedic here.

1998
03:29:38,005 --> 03:29:39,745
[SPEAKER_38]: I think that's a fair statement.

1999
03:29:41,227 --> 03:29:50,955
[SPEAKER_38]: So the Councilor rolling his eyes, I wonder if he's gonna resign his commission because everything that he uses to defend this country, it's not the Department of War, it's the Department of Defense.

2000
03:29:50,995 --> 03:29:52,677
[SPEAKER_38]: They changed it in forties for a reason.

2001
03:29:53,498 --> 03:29:55,519
[SPEAKER_38]: You're gonna resign your commission, put your money where your mouth is?

2002
03:29:56,300 --> 03:29:57,481
[SPEAKER_38]: What about everyone else in this room?

2003
03:29:57,501 --> 03:30:01,845
[SPEAKER_38]: You're gonna sit there and get rid of your cell phones because they're made with plastic and oil.

2004
03:30:01,865 --> 03:30:04,087
[SPEAKER_38]: How about medical technology?

2005
03:30:04,107 --> 03:30:06,889
[SPEAKER_38]: We're just gonna sit there and go back to the stone age and we use only metal.

2006
03:30:07,370 --> 03:30:08,631
[SPEAKER_38]: We'll be back in the civil war era.

2007
03:30:09,918 --> 03:30:12,919
[SPEAKER_38]: It's a Pandora's box you've opened and there's no good answers for this.

2008
03:30:13,039 --> 03:30:14,579
[SPEAKER_38]: All it does is divide the community.

2009
03:30:14,959 --> 03:30:17,880
[SPEAKER_38]: And everyone at this point, everyone likes to eat in this country.

2010
03:30:18,220 --> 03:30:19,860
[SPEAKER_38]: Farming is used with fossil fuels.

2011
03:30:19,920 --> 03:30:22,501
[SPEAKER_38]: I wish it wasn't, but that's not the reality of today.

2012
03:30:23,141 --> 03:30:30,362
[SPEAKER_38]: So how many of you behind the rail are then gonna support the great reformation and 15 to 60 million people dying of starvation?

2013
03:30:30,782 --> 03:30:32,083
[SPEAKER_38]: Let's have it in this country today.

2014
03:30:32,223 --> 03:30:33,063
[SPEAKER_38]: Love it, let's do it.

2015
03:30:34,137 --> 03:30:35,297
[SPEAKER_38]: It's not realistic.

2016
03:30:36,038 --> 03:30:41,859
[SPEAKER_38]: This is virtue signaling, it's divisive, and it's not local in solving local Medford problems.

2017
03:30:43,860 --> 03:30:44,400
[SPEAKER_38]: Stop this.

2018
03:30:44,760 --> 03:30:45,580
[SPEAKER_38]: I've said it before.

2019
03:30:46,281 --> 03:30:53,343
[SPEAKER_38]: Other people agree, you pick this night because other people would be distracted with an event that was planned many months ago.

2020
03:30:54,434 --> 03:30:57,156
[SPEAKER_38]: And you could have done this on a different night in the council schedule.

2021
03:30:57,176 --> 03:30:59,438
[SPEAKER_38]: And you can laugh too, Councilor Bears, but it's true.

2022
03:31:00,139 --> 03:31:02,461
[SPEAKER_38]: That was scheduled well beforehand.

2023
03:31:02,541 --> 03:31:06,083
[SPEAKER_38]: So you picked this night intentionally hoping people would stay home and they have.

2024
03:31:06,123 --> 03:31:08,946
[SPEAKER_38]: So congratulations again on dividing the city.

2025
03:31:12,469 --> 03:31:17,112
[SPEAKER_64]: I'll just add a point of information that city council meetings are always on Tuesdays at this time.

2026
03:31:17,212 --> 03:31:22,757
[SPEAKER_64]: And this matter was delayed initially because a councilor invoked a piece of mass general law to delay it.

2027
03:31:25,771 --> 03:31:26,932
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

2028
03:31:26,952 --> 03:31:27,733
[SPEAKER_64]: You have three minutes.

2029
03:31:29,074 --> 03:31:30,675
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi, my name is Michael Prentke.

2030
03:31:30,735 --> 03:31:32,416
[SPEAKER_30]: I live at 340 High Street.

2031
03:31:34,178 --> 03:31:41,003
[SPEAKER_30]: I think my first thing is getting to invoke a divisiveness, like who gets to define what is divisive?

2032
03:31:41,383 --> 03:31:54,614
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think to continue to invest in weapons manufacturing and for-profit prisons and et cetera, that is divisive.

2033
03:31:55,988 --> 03:31:56,488
[SPEAKER_30]: inherently.

2034
03:31:57,589 --> 03:32:01,253
[SPEAKER_30]: So it's very subjective as to what is divisive.

2035
03:32:01,313 --> 03:32:03,535
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't think you get to claim that.

2036
03:32:04,596 --> 03:32:08,799
[SPEAKER_30]: And as far as virtue signaling, I mean, yeah, it is virtue signaling.

2037
03:32:08,819 --> 03:32:11,862
[SPEAKER_30]: We're saying that we don't like that.

2038
03:32:12,182 --> 03:32:12,803
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't like that.

2039
03:32:12,883 --> 03:32:14,184
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't want to invest in that.

2040
03:32:14,224 --> 03:32:20,890
[SPEAKER_30]: So yes, I would like to virtue signal and say, I don't want to invest in weapons manufacturing there.

2041
03:32:22,452 --> 03:32:33,355
[SPEAKER_30]: One guy on the call, he said that, how come, like, are we going to start calling out other countries?

2042
03:32:33,415 --> 03:32:34,655
[SPEAKER_30]: Is this not just about Israel?

2043
03:32:34,695 --> 03:32:37,076
[SPEAKER_30]: And yeah, it's not just about Israel.

2044
03:32:37,096 --> 03:32:42,437
[SPEAKER_30]: It's about anyone who's investing in arms manufacturing for evil.

2045
03:32:43,217 --> 03:32:44,657
[SPEAKER_30]: So yeah, it's not just about Israel.

2046
03:32:49,347 --> 03:33:03,596
[SPEAKER_30]: For all the Jews, and by the way, I'm Jewish, for all the Jews who are saying a feeling, a lack of safety, there was so many other people who spoke about immediate family members who literally have been killed and destroyed.

2047
03:33:03,616 --> 03:33:06,738
[SPEAKER_30]: That's a literal, actual thing that's happening every moment.

2048
03:33:06,898 --> 03:33:07,899
[SPEAKER_30]: That's not just a feeling.

2049
03:33:07,919 --> 03:33:11,661
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, there's like somebody did some spray paint.

2050
03:33:11,741 --> 03:33:14,583
[SPEAKER_30]: Their families are actually being murdered.

2051
03:33:15,279 --> 03:33:16,060
[SPEAKER_30]: on the daily right now.

2052
03:33:16,100 --> 03:33:18,102
[SPEAKER_30]: That's a real thing happening.

2053
03:33:18,462 --> 03:33:20,664
[SPEAKER_30]: So for the Jews, I'm with you.

2054
03:33:20,684 --> 03:33:25,008
[SPEAKER_30]: I know antisemitism is real, but that's a feeling.

2055
03:33:25,048 --> 03:33:27,050
[SPEAKER_30]: We're not being murdered in the streets like that.

2056
03:33:27,070 --> 03:33:27,751
[SPEAKER_30]: It's not the same.

2057
03:33:27,791 --> 03:33:29,172
[SPEAKER_30]: We can't make this false equivalence.

2058
03:33:30,534 --> 03:33:32,075
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, that's it.

2059
03:33:32,435 --> 03:33:35,538
[SPEAKER_30]: So suffice to say, I am in favor of the ordinance.

2060
03:33:35,799 --> 03:33:36,059
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

2061
03:33:43,758 --> 03:33:44,679
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

2062
03:33:44,699 --> 03:33:45,900
[SPEAKER_48]: My name is Jaydeen Gott.

2063
03:33:46,020 --> 03:33:49,703
[SPEAKER_48]: I live on Frederick Ave here in Medford, and I'd like to speak in support of this ordinance.

2064
03:33:51,344 --> 03:34:02,372
[SPEAKER_48]: When I sat down to listen to the various arguments today and people talking about how disjointed this felt, that seemed wrong to me.

2065
03:34:02,853 --> 03:34:04,714
[SPEAKER_48]: Many of these issues are tied together.

2066
03:34:05,575 --> 03:34:07,997
[SPEAKER_48]: Particularly, I live in a flight path.

2067
03:34:09,355 --> 03:34:16,661
[SPEAKER_48]: The use of avgas, leaded avgas was, it has really just been phased out in the last 15 years.

2068
03:34:17,341 --> 03:34:24,187
[SPEAKER_48]: I know that I cannot use the soil in my own yard to grow those cherry tomatoes that somebody spoke about on Zoom.

2069
03:34:24,548 --> 03:34:26,409
[SPEAKER_48]: I've had to bring in dirt from other places.

2070
03:34:27,430 --> 03:34:29,292
[SPEAKER_48]: When I think about

2071
03:34:30,295 --> 03:34:48,492
[SPEAKER_48]: how the weapons of mass destruction that we would like to divest from affect the environment, that every bomb we drop does not just emit carbon into the atmosphere, but it also kills any plants that would sequester carbon into the future.

2072
03:34:49,742 --> 03:34:51,923
[SPEAKER_48]: We want to protect that environment.

2073
03:34:51,943 --> 03:34:58,566
[SPEAKER_48]: We want to protect our children, our future, so that they have a planet to grow up for.

2074
03:34:59,147 --> 03:35:08,151
[SPEAKER_48]: We need to act locally if we want to make the future for those children a reality.

2075
03:35:09,132 --> 03:35:09,432
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

2076
03:35:14,458 --> 03:35:15,318
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

2077
03:35:16,479 --> 03:35:20,600
[SPEAKER_64]: Anybody who has already spoken will be given one additional minute to speak.

2078
03:35:21,240 --> 03:35:25,041
[SPEAKER_64]: Is there anybody in person or on Zoom who has not yet spoken?

2079
03:35:25,061 --> 03:35:29,302
[SPEAKER_64]: If so, please, who's first podium?

2080
03:35:29,322 --> 03:35:29,902
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll take you first.

2081
03:35:32,623 --> 03:35:33,743
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

2082
03:35:34,104 --> 03:35:37,765
[SPEAKER_10]: Barbara Redstein, 16 Intervale Avenue.

2083
03:35:42,246 --> 03:35:42,446
[SPEAKER_10]: So,

2084
03:35:44,710 --> 03:35:48,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Well-meaning people sometimes make mistakes.

2085
03:35:50,232 --> 03:35:54,413
[SPEAKER_10]: And it takes a lot of courage to admit those mistakes.

2086
03:35:55,893 --> 03:35:59,574
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe that this ordinance is a mistake.

2087
03:36:02,295 --> 03:36:03,596
[SPEAKER_10]: The entire ordinance.

2088
03:36:04,996 --> 03:36:07,497
[SPEAKER_10]: You can dress up Section D

2089
03:36:10,500 --> 03:36:14,508
[SPEAKER_10]: But the ordinance is not going to stop what's happening in Gaza.

2090
03:36:15,933 --> 03:36:23,656
[SPEAKER_10]: The Palestinian people had been victimized for decades, maybe centuries, I don't know how long.

2091
03:36:24,716 --> 03:36:40,883
[SPEAKER_10]: Yasser Arafat at one time had amassed a fortune of between one and $3 billion from aid that was given to the Palestinians by the United States and several other countries.

2092
03:36:41,941 --> 03:36:45,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Mahmoud Abbas is worth $100 million.

2093
03:36:47,106 --> 03:36:50,249
[SPEAKER_10]: Where did this money come from?

2094
03:36:51,010 --> 03:36:52,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Where did it go?

2095
03:36:52,151 --> 03:36:58,418
[SPEAKER_10]: It certainly didn't go to help the Palestinian people.

2096
03:36:59,719 --> 03:37:02,201
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think this message is bold.

2097
03:37:06,865 --> 03:37:09,766
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it should never have been brought to us.

2098
03:37:10,627 --> 03:37:13,268
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to stop what's happening in Gaza.

2099
03:37:14,048 --> 03:37:17,230
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to fix the potholes in our streets.

2100
03:37:17,910 --> 03:37:20,451
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to help our climate initiative.

2101
03:37:20,991 --> 03:37:24,293
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to support our police, our fire, our teachers.

2102
03:37:25,113 --> 03:37:27,874
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to support our public works.

2103
03:37:28,014 --> 03:37:35,698
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not going to do any of those things, which I believe is the mandate of what a city council is supposed to do.

2104
03:37:37,814 --> 03:37:44,017
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly don't need to remind everybody what a diverse community we have here.

2105
03:37:46,678 --> 03:37:56,722
[SPEAKER_10]: We're multilingual, multiethnic, multicultural, a microcosm of the world.

2106
03:37:59,937 --> 03:38:07,762
[SPEAKER_10]: And we shouldn't be pitting communities within Medford against each other.

2107
03:38:09,663 --> 03:38:14,206
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have heard Jewish people speak in favor of this.

2108
03:38:15,527 --> 03:38:19,849
[SPEAKER_10]: You have heard Jewish people speak in opposition.

2109
03:38:20,810 --> 03:38:24,332
[SPEAKER_10]: So right there, you have divided the community.

2110
03:38:25,593 --> 03:38:27,254
[SPEAKER_10]: I think unnecessarily.

2111
03:38:29,249 --> 03:38:40,514
[SPEAKER_10]: And the last thing we need is for any governmental body to pass any resolution.

2112
03:38:43,235 --> 03:38:46,336
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope everybody's still awake because it's been a long time.

2113
03:38:46,796 --> 03:38:54,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Any resolution that would lead to the discrimination of any community of any kind.

2114
03:38:55,140 --> 03:38:55,960
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your time.

2115
03:39:01,477 --> 03:39:02,638
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

2116
03:39:03,138 --> 03:39:06,459
[SPEAKER_32]: Brenda Price, 27 Stanton Street in Malden.

2117
03:39:07,500 --> 03:39:28,069
[SPEAKER_32]: As a resident of Malden, I really appreciate this resolution coming forward, the chance to vote on it, the chance for us to speak on it, and for the chance for residents of Malden to see Medford as an example in passing resolution that is going to do so much for our local communities, our local environment,

2118
03:39:29,370 --> 03:39:42,520
[SPEAKER_32]: climate resiliency, and yes, divesting from things that we don't want to have our communities be, you know, financially connected to.

2119
03:39:43,041 --> 03:39:44,101
[SPEAKER_32]: I am disabled.

2120
03:39:44,142 --> 03:39:53,449
[SPEAKER_32]: I have a bunch of allergies, including the toxic chemical dyes that someone mentioned that are out of Bangladesh.

2121
03:39:53,909 --> 03:39:54,870
[SPEAKER_32]: I would love

2122
03:39:55,562 --> 03:40:03,748
[SPEAKER_32]: love love to be able to shop in stores and have clothes that are bright colors that don't make me sick.

2123
03:40:05,229 --> 03:40:14,816
[SPEAKER_32]: And so something that seems far-fetched to one person is actually going to be helping members of your community and residents that live here

2124
03:40:16,137 --> 03:40:25,904
[SPEAKER_32]: And we're all connected as neighbors, and we don't always all see the benefits that could come out of a resolution like this.

2125
03:40:26,044 --> 03:40:34,230
[SPEAKER_32]: But I hear all of these examples that could be, you know, things that are hard to do.

2126
03:40:34,370 --> 03:40:40,494
[SPEAKER_32]: And I think there are opportunities to do better for residents now and future residents.

2127
03:40:41,054 --> 03:40:44,557
[SPEAKER_32]: So thank you for this, and I hope it passes.

2128
03:40:49,443 --> 03:40:49,803
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

2129
03:40:51,224 --> 03:40:52,385
[SPEAKER_43]: Name and address for the record, please.

2130
03:40:53,086 --> 03:40:54,447
[SPEAKER_43]: You know that I could not speak.

2131
03:40:55,487 --> 03:40:58,670
[SPEAKER_43]: My name is Paulette Vartabedian, 27 Central Lab Medford.

2132
03:40:59,631 --> 03:41:06,155
[SPEAKER_43]: While I do agree with the ideology of this proposal, I think it's great.

2133
03:41:06,295 --> 03:41:09,938
[SPEAKER_43]: I would love it if all weapons would stop.

2134
03:41:10,419 --> 03:41:17,544
[SPEAKER_43]: But the thing that concerns me moving forward from this is some of the things that George and some of the other speakers brought up, which is the

2135
03:41:18,666 --> 03:41:21,771
[SPEAKER_43]: possible legalities of it and also the

2136
03:41:23,730 --> 03:41:26,631
[SPEAKER_43]: financial burden that it may cause in the future.

2137
03:41:28,372 --> 03:41:36,675
[SPEAKER_43]: I think before it moves forward that we need to see what the answers are to those possible issues.

2138
03:41:37,615 --> 03:41:44,357
[SPEAKER_43]: Any plan, anything that happens in life, there are going to be things that come up unplanned.

2139
03:41:44,658 --> 03:41:51,220
[SPEAKER_43]: But it's best that if we have answers to the things that are visible that possibly could

2140
03:41:52,742 --> 03:41:58,163
[SPEAKER_43]: potentially have an issue that we have an answer before we jump in to the water.

2141
03:41:58,624 --> 03:42:00,584
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm not against the proposal.

2142
03:42:00,644 --> 03:42:04,365
[SPEAKER_43]: I think it's good, but I think we need to have more information.

2143
03:42:04,685 --> 03:42:15,908
[SPEAKER_43]: And perhaps what Zach brought up earlier, that if this is the first reading and he sends out questionnaires to get some of those answers, perhaps those will be answered in the second and third reading.

2144
03:42:16,228 --> 03:42:21,370
[SPEAKER_43]: But I'd like to have some of those answers prior to being fully invested in this.

2145
03:42:21,650 --> 03:42:21,970
[SPEAKER_43]: That's it.

2146
03:42:22,070 --> 03:42:22,350
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

2147
03:42:22,942 --> 03:42:23,515
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you for your time.

2148
03:42:27,231 --> 03:42:28,672
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record again, please.

2149
03:42:29,492 --> 03:42:30,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Dave Sherman, Rosemary Way.

2150
03:42:31,093 --> 03:42:41,019
[SPEAKER_16]: So as I predicted when I spoke earlier, there were going to be a lot of people claiming Jewish ancestry and saying that it's completely Jewish to be anti-Zionist.

2151
03:42:41,059 --> 03:42:43,801
[SPEAKER_16]: And of course, that's nothing more than cultural misappropriation.

2152
03:42:44,261 --> 03:42:46,162
[SPEAKER_16]: What did surprise me was a couple of things.

2153
03:42:46,363 --> 03:42:52,466
[SPEAKER_16]: One was having a Nazi, excuse me, a descendant of a Nazi soldier come out in favor of this ordinance.

2154
03:42:52,546 --> 03:42:53,587
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a bit of a surprise.

2155
03:42:54,387 --> 03:42:56,028
[SPEAKER_16]: But I won't make the ad hominem argument.

2156
03:42:56,068 --> 03:42:56,729
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't do that.

2157
03:42:57,449 --> 03:43:11,205
[SPEAKER_16]: It also surprised me that there are advocates of this ordinance that say, well, Medford doesn't really have a whole lot that's invested in Israel.

2158
03:43:11,405 --> 03:43:15,850
[SPEAKER_16]: Other advocates say, oh, well, we've got way too much, so somebody is lying.

2159
03:43:16,431 --> 03:43:17,631
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not my first rodeo.

2160
03:43:17,831 --> 03:43:19,212
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm used to hearing lies from the other side.

2161
03:43:19,272 --> 03:43:20,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Please address the chair.

2162
03:43:20,232 --> 03:43:20,552
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2163
03:43:20,672 --> 03:43:22,173
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm used to hearing lies from the other side.

2164
03:43:22,213 --> 03:43:23,613
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not my first rodeo.

2165
03:43:24,213 --> 03:43:38,517
[SPEAKER_16]: Look, there are values in this proposal that the city may want to endorse and vote with its dollars, such as limiting fossil fuels and targeting real human rights violators like China, which with over a billion people and targeting real human rights violators such as China at that time, please reject this resolution.

2166
03:43:44,454 --> 03:43:45,235
[SPEAKER_64]: Please approach the podium.

2167
03:43:45,255 --> 03:43:46,798
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll have one additional minute as well.

2168
03:43:47,318 --> 03:43:48,160
[SPEAKER_64]: And your name again, please.

2169
03:43:51,144 --> 03:43:55,991
[SPEAKER_61]: Once again, Roni Simcha-Miller, 59 Winchester Street here in Medford.

2170
03:43:56,372 --> 03:43:57,874
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you for the opportunity to speak again.

2171
03:44:02,277 --> 03:44:06,599
[SPEAKER_61]: Wanted to speak now that I'm more clear headed, not as a Jew, but just as a person.

2172
03:44:07,780 --> 03:44:22,246
[SPEAKER_61]: One of the things that I missed was that I am a teacher and I wanted to talk about a thing that I deal with every day with young children, which is the idea of teaching through direct consequence and how that can be translated on the large municipal level to divestment.

2173
03:44:22,346 --> 03:44:23,447
[SPEAKER_61]: And that is what divestment is.

2174
03:44:23,887 --> 03:44:30,350
[SPEAKER_61]: It's essentially saying, if you use your toys to harm large swaths of people every single day, we don't pay for it anymore.

2175
03:44:30,910 --> 03:44:35,733
[SPEAKER_61]: We're not just putting money into these accounts where that money goes to things that harm people.

2176
03:44:36,273 --> 03:44:36,633
[SPEAKER_61]: That's it.

2177
03:44:37,114 --> 03:44:37,934
[SPEAKER_61]: Direct consequence.

2178
03:44:38,314 --> 03:44:38,735
[SPEAKER_61]: That's all.

2179
03:44:41,076 --> 03:44:44,618
[SPEAKER_61]: So that's all I had to add to this.

2180
03:44:45,339 --> 03:44:54,864
[SPEAKER_61]: And I wanted to thank everybody's patience, especially the Councilors here today that have stayed late and are allowing people to come back with additional comment as well.

2181
03:44:54,904 --> 03:44:55,224
[SPEAKER_61]: Thank you.

2182
03:44:55,885 --> 03:44:56,145
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

2183
03:45:00,875 --> 03:45:01,595
[SPEAKER_64]: One additional minute.

2184
03:45:01,615 --> 03:45:02,575
[SPEAKER_64]: I'm going to hold you to it, Micah.

2185
03:45:03,096 --> 03:45:03,476
[SPEAKER_75]: Sure, yeah.

2186
03:45:03,496 --> 03:45:05,076
[SPEAKER_75]: My name is Micah Shulman-Kesselman.

2187
03:45:05,536 --> 03:45:06,717
[SPEAKER_75]: I live at 499 Main Street.

2188
03:45:07,437 --> 03:45:10,898
[SPEAKER_75]: Apparently, generations of Jewish people in my family, I'm just appropriating.

2189
03:45:10,998 --> 03:45:11,518
[SPEAKER_75]: I'm a fake Jew.

2190
03:45:11,778 --> 03:45:11,998
[SPEAKER_75]: Cool.

2191
03:45:12,138 --> 03:45:12,498
[SPEAKER_75]: News to me.

2192
03:45:12,878 --> 03:45:13,759
[SPEAKER_75]: Dope.

2193
03:45:14,599 --> 03:45:20,941
[SPEAKER_75]: But with that said, I really quickly want to just mention, because this has been brought up a few times, that this hasn't gone through legal rigor or hasn't gone through diligence.

2194
03:45:21,781 --> 03:45:24,602
[SPEAKER_75]: This ordinance has gone through months and months of drafting.

2195
03:45:26,413 --> 03:45:42,418
[SPEAKER_75]: It's gone before multiple different legal teams, different lawyers, it's gone through financial experts, it's modeled off of successful ordinances in other cities across the country that have not shown any undue financial harm to the cities that have implemented it.

2196
03:45:42,839 --> 03:45:46,340
[SPEAKER_75]: It is a successful, it will be a successful ordinance when it gets put in.

2197
03:45:47,080 --> 03:45:47,661
[SPEAKER_75]: into effect.

2198
03:45:48,501 --> 03:45:59,292
[SPEAKER_75]: If you have an actual example of where some sort of ordinance like this has failed the city that it's been put into, a discrete data point, by all means, bring it forward.

2199
03:45:59,712 --> 03:46:07,159
[SPEAKER_75]: And there are three, there's two more sessions, there's two more stages of this ordinance that go through amendment.

2200
03:46:07,179 --> 03:46:09,541
[SPEAKER_75]: So you have the chance to amend it if that is your issue.

2201
03:46:09,682 --> 03:46:10,402
[SPEAKER_64]: That's time, Micah.

2202
03:46:10,943 --> 03:46:11,203
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

2203
03:46:17,713 --> 03:46:21,934
[SPEAKER_64]: All right, we'll go to you, Andy, and then we'll go back to repeat talkers on Zoom.

2204
03:46:22,435 --> 03:46:23,535
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

2205
03:46:25,496 --> 03:46:29,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Andrew Castagnetti, Medford resident, East Medford.

2206
03:46:35,199 --> 03:46:36,019
[SPEAKER_09]: War is hell.

2207
03:46:36,599 --> 03:46:38,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, war is worse than hell.

2208
03:46:40,921 --> 03:46:43,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Because in hell, you expect to burn, at least most of us do.

2209
03:46:46,127 --> 03:46:50,068
[SPEAKER_09]: But in war, you don't know what village is gonna be hit.

2210
03:46:52,409 --> 03:47:00,592
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm always a peacenik, always, except on certain occasions.

2211
03:47:02,153 --> 03:47:05,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a Woodstock graduate, 1969, I repeat.

2212
03:47:07,695 --> 03:47:12,897
[SPEAKER_09]: We protested a lousy Vietnam War and a damn military draft.

2213
03:47:14,187 --> 03:47:21,611
[SPEAKER_09]: We were part of the first ever of 100,000 gathering in Boston Commons in 68, or maybe it was 69.

2214
03:47:22,511 --> 03:47:23,432
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not quite sure.

2215
03:47:25,213 --> 03:47:27,134
[SPEAKER_09]: We were hip, but we were not hippies.

2216
03:47:29,095 --> 03:47:33,577
[SPEAKER_09]: We youths had real problems with war.

2217
03:47:34,518 --> 03:47:36,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Today's youths have no clue.

2218
03:47:39,340 --> 03:47:42,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, without armatures,

2219
03:47:43,182 --> 03:47:46,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Those companies supply the USA.

2220
03:47:49,165 --> 03:48:01,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Without that firepower, USA would have lost World War II, and you and I would be spooked in German or be never born dead.

2221
03:48:04,872 --> 03:48:10,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Three, yes, I'm against all pollution.

2222
03:48:11,075 --> 03:48:12,516
[SPEAKER_09]: It's bad enough that I smoke.

2223
03:48:14,600 --> 03:48:19,343
[SPEAKER_09]: but you cannot snap your thumb and get off the oral addiction.

2224
03:48:20,163 --> 03:48:21,384
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes time.

2225
03:48:22,545 --> 03:48:23,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, but no thanks.

2226
03:48:26,627 --> 03:48:27,167
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Andy.

2227
03:48:29,248 --> 03:48:33,831
[SPEAKER_64]: We will return to Munir on Zoom for one additional minute and then back to the podium.

2228
03:48:36,573 --> 03:48:37,093
[SPEAKER_64]: Go ahead, Munir.

2229
03:48:39,532 --> 03:48:40,353
[SPEAKER_78]: All right, thank you.

2230
03:48:40,373 --> 03:48:46,017
[SPEAKER_78]: I am Munir Germanus from Summit Road in Medford.

2231
03:48:47,458 --> 03:48:50,961
[SPEAKER_78]: I just wanted to finish up what I was about to say before.

2232
03:48:50,981 --> 03:48:57,506
[SPEAKER_78]: It is not antisemitic to call for an end to the genocide in Gaza.

2233
03:48:58,430 --> 03:49:09,695
[SPEAKER_78]: we will only establish a better world where we can learn not to take critiques of harms caused by governments to be evidence of discrimination.

2234
03:49:10,736 --> 03:49:14,317
[SPEAKER_78]: This ordinance goes a long way to imagining that world.

2235
03:49:14,837 --> 03:49:20,980
[SPEAKER_78]: We need to take back our public dollars and make sure they are invested in the world that we want to live in.

2236
03:49:21,941 --> 03:49:24,822
[SPEAKER_78]: I applaud the folks who worked on this ordinance

2237
03:49:25,470 --> 03:49:36,217
[SPEAKER_78]: and urge each and every councilor to pass it as it reflects our values and takes a courageous stand against any human rights violations anywhere.

2238
03:49:36,758 --> 03:49:37,158
[SPEAKER_78]: Thank you.

2239
03:49:41,561 --> 03:49:43,742
[SPEAKER_64]: Go ahead, Nate.

2240
03:49:43,762 --> 03:49:44,743
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have one additional minute.

2241
03:49:45,103 --> 03:49:46,764
[SPEAKER_38]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

2242
03:49:47,765 --> 03:49:54,950
[SPEAKER_38]: So this council in the last election, because it was a financial issue,

2243
03:49:55,603 --> 03:50:02,288
[SPEAKER_38]: made motions and actually made a put on the ballot, the overrides.

2244
03:50:03,749 --> 03:50:09,593
[SPEAKER_38]: If you think that because you've tied this financially to the city and the investments of the city, put it on the ballot.

2245
03:50:09,833 --> 03:50:10,874
[SPEAKER_38]: You don't think it's divisive.

2246
03:50:11,354 --> 03:50:12,235
[SPEAKER_38]: Let the people speak.

2247
03:50:12,615 --> 03:50:14,076
[SPEAKER_38]: You've heard the people in the room here.

2248
03:50:14,496 --> 03:50:17,398
[SPEAKER_38]: You've heard other people that have come in previous weeks.

2249
03:50:18,299 --> 03:50:19,059
[SPEAKER_38]: Put it on the ballot.

2250
03:50:19,320 --> 03:50:19,620
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

2251
03:50:25,685 --> 03:50:26,005
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

2252
03:50:26,025 --> 03:50:29,047
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

2253
03:50:29,087 --> 03:50:29,927
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

2254
03:50:31,628 --> 03:50:32,829
[SPEAKER_59]: My name is Gina Chen.

2255
03:50:32,869 --> 03:50:34,230
[SPEAKER_59]: I live in South Medford.

2256
03:50:34,570 --> 03:50:35,671
[SPEAKER_59]: Today's my birthday.

2257
03:50:35,691 --> 03:50:40,754
[SPEAKER_59]: A lot of people in my life were like, why are you spending your birthday going to a city council meeting?

2258
03:50:41,734 --> 03:50:51,000
[SPEAKER_59]: And I just want to say that there's no better way I could spend my birthday than listening to my actual neighbors speak their thoughts

2259
03:50:51,758 --> 03:51:04,583
[SPEAKER_59]: and to learn how many of them use simple words to communicate simply that they love life on earth, they love children, they support life on earth and they want to make the world a better place.

2260
03:51:07,924 --> 03:51:14,407
[SPEAKER_59]: So thank you for bringing this ordinance to the table and I'm in full support of it.

2261
03:51:22,017 --> 03:51:22,337
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

2262
03:51:23,358 --> 03:51:24,479
[SPEAKER_64]: Anyone to address for the record, please?

2263
03:51:24,719 --> 03:51:25,379
[SPEAKER_67]: You have three minutes.

2264
03:51:26,880 --> 03:51:34,385
[SPEAKER_67]: My name is Fawaz Abusharak, and I'm with the Boston Coalition for Palestine, Palestinian House of New England, and North Shore for Palestine.

2265
03:51:36,847 --> 03:51:41,270
[SPEAKER_67]: The only democracy in the Middle East, it was said way earlier, but it really bugged me.

2266
03:51:41,310 --> 03:51:49,676
[SPEAKER_67]: Democracies never do apartheid, racism, and discrimination, or occupy others and commit genocide and ethnic cleansing.

2267
03:51:51,433 --> 03:52:10,483
[SPEAKER_67]: Through you, Madam Chair, to the Honorable City Council members, and to all in this room, I have one name, Hind Rajab, six years old, who got shot with 335 bullets by the Israeli Genocide Forces.

2268
03:52:11,724 --> 03:52:17,367
[SPEAKER_67]: Who in this room or anywhere wants to invest in the company that made these bullets?

2269
03:52:19,472 --> 03:52:24,094
[SPEAKER_67]: Who builds or any other company that builds bombs and other weapons?

2270
03:52:25,494 --> 03:52:31,736
[SPEAKER_67]: Or worse, invest in the entity that shot them at the six-years-old child?

2271
03:52:33,017 --> 03:52:35,618
[SPEAKER_67]: In a perfect world, the answer is no one.

2272
03:52:36,598 --> 03:52:41,800
[SPEAKER_67]: I'm old enough to know that we do not live in a perfect world.

2273
03:52:43,580 --> 03:52:48,242
[SPEAKER_67]: So I ask the honorable Councilors to vote tonight

2274
03:52:49,050 --> 03:52:50,451
[SPEAKER_67]: Yes for this ordinance.

2275
03:52:51,991 --> 03:53:01,095
[SPEAKER_67]: That will help in building a future that is more perfect and better for generations to come all over the world.

2276
03:53:02,395 --> 03:53:03,816
[SPEAKER_67]: This is building the future.

2277
03:53:04,236 --> 03:53:06,257
[SPEAKER_67]: This is not about what happened in the past.

2278
03:53:07,738 --> 03:53:18,162
[SPEAKER_67]: As some might remember when we came here before in this room when I said we are not here for a political victory because it's still there isn't one to have at this point.

2279
03:53:18,606 --> 03:53:20,746
[SPEAKER_67]: We didn't have one a while ago.

2280
03:53:21,127 --> 03:53:22,967
[SPEAKER_67]: This is beyond political victories.

2281
03:53:23,827 --> 03:53:28,148
[SPEAKER_67]: We are here for a moral, righteous, and humanitarian victory.

2282
03:53:28,828 --> 03:53:36,490
[SPEAKER_67]: And with you voting yes tonight for this ordinance, we will have that moral and righteous victory.

2283
03:53:37,270 --> 03:53:43,251
[SPEAKER_67]: From Turtle Island, in solidarity for a free world, starting with a free Palestine.

2284
03:53:52,221 --> 03:53:56,764
[SPEAKER_64]: Is there anybody else in person or on Zoom who would like to speak for the first or second time?

2285
03:53:56,844 --> 03:54:00,866
[SPEAKER_64]: I see one new speaker on Zoom, and I'm going to ask you to unmute.

2286
03:54:00,906 --> 03:54:02,127
[SPEAKER_64]: You will have three minutes.

2287
03:54:06,830 --> 03:54:09,832
[SPEAKER_64]: Oh, well, I'm hearing that you already spoke, so I'll give you one.

2288
03:54:09,872 --> 03:54:10,793
[SPEAKER_74]: Yes, I've already spoken.

2289
03:54:12,542 --> 03:54:14,163
[SPEAKER_74]: But thank you for the opportunity to speak.

2290
03:54:14,643 --> 03:54:18,026
[SPEAKER_74]: First of all, I don't think our main goal here should be non-divisiveness.

2291
03:54:18,986 --> 03:54:21,127
[SPEAKER_74]: Progress and justice are always divisive.

2292
03:54:21,668 --> 03:54:26,411
[SPEAKER_74]: But I want to address the fears of retaliation from the Trump administration in response to this ordinance.

2293
03:54:26,831 --> 03:54:32,855
[SPEAKER_74]: President Trump is a tyrant and aspirational dictator, and tyrants always punish those they deem to be political enemies.

2294
03:54:33,275 --> 03:54:38,058
[SPEAKER_74]: We cannot allow fear of retaliation to dictate our actions here and to dictate our ethics.

2295
03:54:38,578 --> 03:54:41,920
[SPEAKER_74]: we cannot capitulate to the Trump administration in advance.

2296
03:54:42,180 --> 03:54:42,500
[SPEAKER_74]: Thank you.

2297
03:54:54,727 --> 03:54:55,508
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

2298
03:54:56,849 --> 03:55:03,853
[SPEAKER_64]: Seeing no further hands raised, I'll go back to my fellow Councilors, President Bears and then Councilor Lazzaro.

2299
03:55:06,201 --> 03:55:07,302
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

2300
03:55:07,362 --> 03:55:14,466
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank you to everyone who spoke tonight, shared their views very clearly.

2301
03:55:16,067 --> 03:55:19,570
[SPEAKER_24]: There are lots of folks who have lots of feelings and opinions about this.

2302
03:55:20,010 --> 03:55:27,595
[SPEAKER_24]: Many folks feeling very personally impacted by this.

2303
03:55:28,635 --> 03:55:33,698
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to first just try to talk to some of the questions that came up.

2304
03:55:33,759 --> 03:55:35,900
[SPEAKER_24]: I think I tracked them relatively well.

2305
03:55:38,615 --> 03:56:06,172
[SPEAKER_24]: When we talk about some of the specific language around the percentage of funds for the sections A and B versus C and D, interestingly, I think a piece of that actually relates to some comments made earlier, noting that there are companies that may well have a hand in some of these industries, but it is not the main thrust of what they do.

2306
03:56:08,253 --> 03:56:09,854
[SPEAKER_24]: Should it just say 0% maybe?

2307
03:56:09,874 --> 03:56:12,296
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, that might be my opinion.

2308
03:56:12,316 --> 03:56:15,619
[SPEAKER_24]: That was coming out of the Boston ordinance.

2309
03:56:17,620 --> 03:56:35,534
[SPEAKER_24]: When we talk about the Trump administration and its attacks on cities, towns, universities, groups, religious organizations, individuals, just the brutal,

2310
03:56:36,427 --> 03:56:43,013
[SPEAKER_24]: bullying and assault on the basic rule of law and integrity of a free and civil society.

2311
03:56:44,074 --> 03:56:51,960
[SPEAKER_24]: Medford is already in its crosshairs, whether for an action that we've taken or just for the fact that we're five miles outside of Boston.

2312
03:56:52,921 --> 03:56:57,965
[SPEAKER_24]: And he doesn't really care that much about collateral damage, as we've learned.

2313
03:57:01,720 --> 03:57:02,760
[SPEAKER_24]: Is any community prepared?

2314
03:57:02,820 --> 03:57:09,403
[SPEAKER_24]: Is any university, is any institution prepared for the iron fist of the President of the United States to come down on them?

2315
03:57:09,883 --> 03:57:14,085
[SPEAKER_24]: If I was to say yes, I don't think anyone would believe me.

2316
03:57:14,245 --> 03:57:19,547
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we've seen the harm that has happened and all of what he's done.

2317
03:57:21,667 --> 03:57:23,228
[SPEAKER_24]: But what folks said earlier is right.

2318
03:57:23,968 --> 03:57:25,689
[SPEAKER_24]: When a bully and a tyrant

2319
03:57:26,402 --> 03:57:28,182
[SPEAKER_24]: comes after you, you don't give in.

2320
03:57:28,362 --> 03:57:34,364
[SPEAKER_24]: Everyone who has given in has lost more and lost ground and made the next attack more likely.

2321
03:57:34,384 --> 03:57:37,205
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we are in a strong position.

2322
03:57:37,245 --> 03:57:54,669
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we're surrounded by communities who are standing up for immigrant rights, standing up for gender identity and the rights of people who have transgender people and people in the LGBTQ community and standing up for racial diversity and standing up against the erasure of history and

2323
03:57:56,428 --> 03:58:06,954
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we will be in a chorus of voices that stands up against targeted assaults on communities because they say we don't want to put our money in fossil fuels or we don't want to put our money in human rights violators.

2324
03:58:09,476 --> 03:58:13,178
[SPEAKER_24]: The last thing I want to talk about goes back to the MSCI screen.

2325
03:58:13,238 --> 03:58:14,078
[SPEAKER_24]: Gaston brought it up.

2326
03:58:14,579 --> 03:58:16,340
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think it's a perfect tool.

2327
03:58:17,968 --> 03:58:24,454
[SPEAKER_24]: I think there's a reason why there's many, many sections and where one may not capture a company, the other does, right?

2328
03:58:24,514 --> 03:58:26,475
[SPEAKER_24]: This is interlinked and intersectional.

2329
03:58:26,856 --> 03:58:43,350
[SPEAKER_24]: These areas are essentially the main challenges to our basic human dignity and rights across the world, whether those are perpetrated by companies who are mainly in fossil fuels or companies remaining in private prisons or companies remaining in weapons.

2330
03:58:44,303 --> 03:58:59,392
[SPEAKER_24]: Something that I want to note about the MSCI methodology that's in here, and I think it kind of goes to the larger context of what we're talking about throughout this conversation, right?

2331
03:58:59,572 --> 03:59:08,118
[SPEAKER_24]: A lot of people feel that this text of this ordinance does something specific that they want it to do.

2332
03:59:08,858 --> 03:59:13,261
[SPEAKER_24]: They may well be right, but the whole point

2333
03:59:14,040 --> 03:59:23,626
[SPEAKER_24]: of international law and international institutions and global norms is that they apply to all of us, to all human beings.

2334
03:59:24,487 --> 03:59:33,213
[SPEAKER_24]: And if you look at this methodology, right, it's in here in 32B, we're talking about things as basic as the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.

2335
03:59:34,705 --> 03:59:45,671
[SPEAKER_24]: the International Labor Organization Convention on the Abolition of Forced Labor, the Convention Against Torture, the Convention from the Protection of All Persons Against Enforced Disappearance.

2336
03:59:46,631 --> 03:59:51,154
[SPEAKER_24]: Every single thing that folks brought up tonight falls in here in some way.

2337
03:59:51,474 --> 03:59:56,817
[SPEAKER_24]: And this methodology identifies 31 vulnerable demographics.

2338
03:59:58,447 --> 04:00:08,715
[SPEAKER_24]: of 31 national civilians and refugees, ethnic, racial, and religious groups located in or originated from countries with ongoing international armed conflicts or military offensives.

2339
04:00:09,816 --> 04:00:14,099
[SPEAKER_24]: It mentions civilians and refugees in Georgia and South Ossetia.

2340
04:00:14,280 --> 04:00:17,582
[SPEAKER_24]: It mentions civilians, refugees in Belarus.

2341
04:00:17,722 --> 04:00:19,604
[SPEAKER_24]: It mentions the Uyghurs in China.

2342
04:00:19,664 --> 04:00:21,946
[SPEAKER_24]: It mentions people in Crimea.

2343
04:00:22,026 --> 04:00:26,169
[SPEAKER_24]: It mentions indigenous people in Colombia, civilians in the Congo,

2344
04:00:28,128 --> 04:00:30,210
[SPEAKER_24]: the Donetsk and Luhansk in Ukraine.

2345
04:00:30,510 --> 04:00:39,858
[SPEAKER_24]: It mentions folks in Haiti and Honduras and Iran and Libya and Myanmar and the Philippines and South Sudan and Syria.

2346
04:00:40,739 --> 04:00:44,442
[SPEAKER_24]: And it mentions Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza.

2347
04:00:45,263 --> 04:00:51,188
[SPEAKER_24]: And it mentions Israelis, mentions all of those groups.

2348
04:00:52,589 --> 04:00:55,792
[SPEAKER_24]: If there is a company that is spending its money

2349
04:00:56,575 --> 04:01:11,702
[SPEAKER_24]: to an investing and committing human rights violations against vulnerable demographics as identified by the international laws and norms that underlie the basic foundations of an international system and liberal order that tries to value and protect all human rights.

2350
04:01:12,002 --> 04:01:13,362
[SPEAKER_24]: It mentions all of those groups.

2351
04:01:15,683 --> 04:01:20,725
[SPEAKER_24]: So for the folks who say it targets one or the other or calls one group out, it's just not true.

2352
04:01:21,586 --> 04:01:22,206
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just not true.

2353
04:01:23,126 --> 04:01:24,087
[SPEAKER_24]: It's written in here.

2354
04:01:26,533 --> 04:01:27,154
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what this is about.

2355
04:01:27,174 --> 04:01:29,896
[SPEAKER_24]: This is about universal values.

2356
04:01:30,576 --> 04:01:32,978
[SPEAKER_24]: And universal values don't come without context.

2357
04:01:33,839 --> 04:01:37,621
[SPEAKER_24]: They don't come without the understanding of what's actually happening in the world.

2358
04:01:39,543 --> 04:01:44,627
[SPEAKER_24]: And a lot of people spoke very deeply and passionately tonight about the context that they feel is closest to them.

2359
04:01:46,037 --> 04:01:46,998
[SPEAKER_24]: There are facts.

2360
04:01:47,338 --> 04:01:48,459
[SPEAKER_24]: There are realities.

2361
04:01:49,199 --> 04:01:54,763
[SPEAKER_24]: There is a genocide going on in Gaza and in Sudan.

2362
04:01:55,123 --> 04:01:57,044
[SPEAKER_24]: And there is forced displacement in Ukraine.

2363
04:01:57,084 --> 04:02:00,427
[SPEAKER_24]: And there is forced labor and religious persecution in China.

2364
04:02:01,387 --> 04:02:03,229
[SPEAKER_24]: Those are things that are happening in this world.

2365
04:02:03,989 --> 04:02:05,850
[SPEAKER_24]: And this ordinance says we don't want to be a part of it.

2366
04:02:08,272 --> 04:02:14,116
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to finish just to say that I appreciate that we've had a difficult conversation.

2367
04:02:16,584 --> 04:02:17,404
[SPEAKER_24]: We've done it civilly.

2368
04:02:17,444 --> 04:02:18,564
[SPEAKER_24]: We've heard from a lot of people.

2369
04:02:18,604 --> 04:02:19,845
[SPEAKER_24]: We've done that a lot in this room.

2370
04:02:20,705 --> 04:02:29,527
[SPEAKER_24]: And I agree with the folks who say that it is not our responsibility to define divisiveness or quote unquote, not be divisive.

2371
04:02:30,327 --> 04:02:42,850
[SPEAKER_24]: To take a position like this is to simply say, we believe in a world order where human rights don't get violated, where our world is not burned, where the people

2372
04:02:44,124 --> 04:02:48,788
[SPEAKER_24]: where the human race has the ability to see a future that is more than 10 or 20 or 30 years out.

2373
04:02:49,608 --> 04:03:08,883
[SPEAKER_24]: And yes, maybe it's little old Medford making the argument, but hopefully more people will join us and a loud chorus will eventually drown out the people and organizations and wealthy elites, as David Harris said, who quite frankly are driving this world towards a global collapse.

2374
04:03:09,824 --> 04:03:11,044
[SPEAKER_24]: So I thank everyone who spoke.

2375
04:03:12,129 --> 04:03:14,269
[SPEAKER_24]: and I reiterate my motion to approve for first reading.

2376
04:03:14,449 --> 04:03:14,830
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2377
04:03:22,991 --> 04:03:23,391
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

2378
04:03:23,451 --> 04:03:27,452
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go to Councilor Lazzaro, and then I have a statement to read from Councilor Callahan.

2379
04:03:32,493 --> 04:03:33,613
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't have much to say.

2380
04:03:33,653 --> 04:03:35,454
[SPEAKER_60]: I'll second President Bearsar's motion.

2381
04:03:36,614 --> 04:03:41,135
[SPEAKER_60]: I do want to reiterate that this is an extremely concrete action we can take.

2382
04:03:42,818 --> 04:04:07,298
[SPEAKER_60]: which feels important because it can be a model for other cities and towns if they were to want to do something similar in the sense that not only can we exhibit our values, display our values in this way, in this concrete way that we have control over,

2383
04:04:08,228 --> 04:04:25,601
[SPEAKER_60]: also that as other places, if they were to follow in this behavior, become kind of a, you know, a, what's that carnival game where the, with the things that you have to hit with the mallet, whack-a-mole.

2384
04:04:25,721 --> 04:04:29,204
[SPEAKER_60]: I think similarly, the way the federal government tries to, you know,

2385
04:04:31,449 --> 04:04:36,972
[SPEAKER_60]: tries to catch all of the communities that are going against their edicts, it becomes too overwhelming.

2386
04:04:38,813 --> 04:04:43,596
[SPEAKER_60]: And as President Bears mentioned, they can't tell the difference between Boston and Medford.

2387
04:04:44,156 --> 04:04:47,878
[SPEAKER_60]: We got the ICE raids the same as everybody else in the region.

2388
04:04:49,799 --> 04:04:57,143
[SPEAKER_60]: It is no reason to not follow our residents, follow their values and our values.

2389
04:04:57,931 --> 04:04:59,553
[SPEAKER_60]: And I also spent my birthday here.

2390
04:04:59,653 --> 04:05:05,458
[SPEAKER_60]: So I loved what the resident said about what a nice way to spend your time.

2391
04:05:07,239 --> 04:05:08,240
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you, everybody who spoke.

2392
04:05:08,420 --> 04:05:09,982
[SPEAKER_60]: I appreciate everybody's perspectives.

2393
04:05:12,444 --> 04:05:20,191
[SPEAKER_60]: I think this was a good way to articulate the kind of community that we have.

2394
04:05:21,132 --> 04:05:21,732
[SPEAKER_60]: So thank you.

2395
04:05:23,434 --> 04:05:24,655
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

2396
04:05:28,218 --> 04:05:36,582
[SPEAKER_64]: Councilor Callahan was not able to be here tonight, but she emailed comments on this ordinance to council leadership shortly before the meeting, and I missed it, so I apologize.

2397
04:05:36,622 --> 04:05:40,224
[SPEAKER_64]: I'm going to read her comments now to include them in the record.

2398
04:05:41,164 --> 04:05:50,930
[SPEAKER_64]: Councilor Callahan wrote, I aim as a city councilor to do what I believe most people here in Medford want, and I do my best to vote that way in general.

2399
04:05:51,770 --> 04:05:56,595
[SPEAKER_64]: But I also always keep in mind whether, by my vote, any harm could be done to any of our residents.

2400
04:05:57,215 --> 04:06:00,419
[SPEAKER_64]: In this values ordinance, there are many parts that are not controversial.

2401
04:06:00,439 --> 04:06:03,321
[SPEAKER_64]: I want to speak about the part that is controversial.

2402
04:06:04,963 --> 04:06:14,072
[SPEAKER_64]: We have been asked by some Palestinian Americans who live in Medford if our city can become neutral in the conflict between the current Israeli administration and the Palestinian people.

2403
04:06:15,105 --> 04:06:22,349
[SPEAKER_64]: I understand that both Palestinian Americans who live in Medford and Jewish Americans who live in Medford can feel that our vote can cause harm.

2404
04:06:23,050 --> 04:06:28,133
[SPEAKER_64]: I feel for both communities and I understand that both communities are feeling vulnerable and worried about the future.

2405
04:06:29,333 --> 04:06:33,556
[SPEAKER_64]: I believe that the majority of people in Medford would prefer that our public money become neutral.

2406
04:06:34,336 --> 04:06:38,959
[SPEAKER_64]: I also believe that becoming neutral is the way to cause the least amount of harm to our local community.

2407
04:06:39,716 --> 04:06:47,259
[SPEAKER_64]: While this conflict is far away, many people here have relatives in these countries, and currently 2 million people are in danger of starving to death.

2408
04:06:48,920 --> 04:06:52,922
[SPEAKER_64]: I am in favor of Medford becoming neutral in this destined but heart-wrenching conflict.

2409
04:06:53,202 --> 04:07:00,125
[SPEAKER_64]: I also want us to work to protect both these important communities here in our city, and I welcome all ideas for how we can do that.

2410
04:07:01,446 --> 04:07:02,967
[SPEAKER_64]: That was the statement from Councilor Callahan.

2411
04:07:02,987 --> 04:07:05,648
[SPEAKER_64]: I'll next recognize Councilor Leming.

2412
04:07:09,770 --> 04:07:18,516
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, this has been a tricky one for me because last year when the ceasefire resolution came up, I voted present for it.

2413
04:07:19,236 --> 04:07:26,982
[SPEAKER_25]: And when another resolution came up that also directly mentioned the conflict, I also voted present.

2414
04:07:27,940 --> 04:07:29,701
[SPEAKER_25]: even for the motion to table that one.

2415
04:07:30,121 --> 04:07:32,362
[SPEAKER_25]: This is a bit of a tricky.

2416
04:07:32,582 --> 04:07:43,607
[SPEAKER_25]: This one's a little bit trickier for me, because it doesn't actually, as President Bears just mentioned, it doesn't actually mention any one country specifically.

2417
04:07:44,128 --> 04:07:54,393
[SPEAKER_25]: So somebody was coming up and saying, well, why can't we divest from China, for instance, because they're detaining the Uighur Muslims?

2418
04:07:55,453 --> 04:08:00,036
[SPEAKER_25]: that actually is something that can be done under the framework of this ordinance.

2419
04:08:02,237 --> 04:08:15,046
[SPEAKER_25]: I also asked about the option of potentially severing parts of it, but that's not a thing that really can be done for ordinances.

2420
04:08:17,307 --> 04:08:24,852
[SPEAKER_25]: So just going by the text of the ordinance itself, I don't think that it

2421
04:08:25,717 --> 04:08:31,681
[SPEAKER_25]: does explicitly target any... I see this as more of a long-term thing.

2422
04:08:31,721 --> 04:08:46,392
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think it explicitly targets any one company, any one country, although the rhetoric around it has been, of course, very different from that.

2423
04:08:47,013 --> 04:08:50,895
[SPEAKER_25]: And so that's something that I've been personally struggling with.

2424
04:08:53,117 --> 04:08:54,318
[SPEAKER_25]: Sometimes it's said that

2425
04:08:55,208 --> 04:08:56,469
[SPEAKER_25]: Perception is reality.

2426
04:08:56,489 --> 04:09:00,410
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't really believe in that quote.

2427
04:09:01,011 --> 04:09:03,752
[SPEAKER_25]: I try to vote on what is in the text right in front of me.

2428
04:09:04,452 --> 04:09:19,339
[SPEAKER_25]: And what's in the text right in front of me is a general framework that includes divesting from a number of different companies over a number of different reasons without mentioning any one in particular.

2429
04:09:19,359 --> 04:09:22,060
[SPEAKER_25]: A lot of presidents disagree on that.

2430
04:09:23,157 --> 04:09:35,985
[SPEAKER_25]: A lot of very often people will come into these chambers and make a judgment based on and project their own personal experiences onto the text that needs to be voted on.

2431
04:09:38,687 --> 04:09:39,967
[SPEAKER_25]: And I respect that.

2432
04:09:41,448 --> 04:09:44,530
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, there's a few other things specifically.

2433
04:09:44,550 --> 04:09:46,191
[SPEAKER_25]: Like even though I'm

2434
04:09:53,136 --> 04:09:55,177
[SPEAKER_25]: member of the military.

2435
04:09:55,197 --> 04:10:07,066
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I remember what Eisenhower said about the US going into the military-industrial complex, and I very much think the country has gone in that direction.

2436
04:10:07,086 --> 04:10:09,487
[SPEAKER_25]: Defense contractors get a lot of money.

2437
04:10:14,112 --> 04:10:26,715
[SPEAKER_25]: I do also appreciate Council President Bears's efforts to strengthen, to make more specific 2D as well.

2438
04:10:28,196 --> 04:10:40,219
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the specificity does help to add a framework to this ordinance, and I do a framework to that decision making that investors have to do.

2439
04:10:40,539 --> 04:10:42,200
[SPEAKER_25]: And I appreciate that.

2440
04:10:43,971 --> 04:10:51,173
[SPEAKER_25]: When it comes to folks saying things like, well, we need to delay, we need more time.

2441
04:10:51,293 --> 04:10:56,135
[SPEAKER_25]: I very often hear those excuses in this chamber.

2442
04:10:56,175 --> 04:10:59,836
[SPEAKER_25]: People say we need to slow down all the time if they just don't really support something.

2443
04:11:00,756 --> 04:11:02,557
[SPEAKER_25]: This has been in the works for months.

2444
04:11:02,817 --> 04:11:12,440
[SPEAKER_25]: And if the mayor or chief of staff sends an email a few hours before the meeting with this whole litany of concerns, that basically just means that they

2445
04:11:13,260 --> 04:11:14,340
[SPEAKER_25]: want to delay the vote.

2446
04:11:14,980 --> 04:11:26,422
[SPEAKER_25]: If that email were sent a week ago, I would have a lot more respect for it, but we frequently get these laundry lists of concerns just before a meeting, and it's a delay tactic.

2447
04:11:26,823 --> 04:11:38,985
[SPEAKER_25]: I think there were one or two things in it that are worth considering, but those can be considered more appropriately in between the first and third reading.

2448
04:11:41,441 --> 04:11:56,833
[SPEAKER_25]: just want folks to know that those are my thoughts on it because I haven't really spoken and I have been earnestly thinking about everything that everybody said here tonight and in the past two meetings before this and I thank you all for your time.

2449
04:11:58,755 --> 04:11:59,215
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

2450
04:11:59,235 --> 04:12:00,917
[SPEAKER_64]: Councilor Leming.

2451
04:12:02,918 --> 04:12:03,799
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

2452
04:12:05,640 --> 04:12:08,943
[SPEAKER_64]: We have a motion on the floor by President Bears that's been seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

2453
04:12:08,983 --> 04:12:09,804
[SPEAKER_64]: I want to quickly

2454
04:12:11,110 --> 04:12:13,013
[SPEAKER_64]: share my thoughts before we move forward to the vote.

2455
04:12:13,033 --> 04:12:15,838
[SPEAKER_64]: Let me speak from the chair.

2456
04:12:15,858 --> 04:12:18,743
[SPEAKER_64]: I want to compliment my colleague.

2457
04:12:19,419 --> 04:12:46,386
[SPEAKER_64]: for the diligence in producing a thorough and carefully rendered first draft of this ordinance in June, and for further revising it into the current version, which I think uses tighter and more specific language to define the terms of our goals here as they relate to the city's financial instruments and to the specific harms from which I think broadly we all agree that we want Medford to be divested from.

2458
04:12:48,053 --> 04:12:49,294
[SPEAKER_64]: I will be supporting this tonight.

2459
04:12:50,435 --> 04:13:11,290
[SPEAKER_64]: I believe there is a clear moral mandate that is supported by many Medford residents, that we do not want our shared assets to be increased through investment in nakedly harmful enterprises, the type of which we would never want to see or experience anywhere near Medford or our surrounding communities.

2460
04:13:13,352 --> 04:13:14,913
[SPEAKER_64]: I don't think that we should govern

2461
04:13:16,437 --> 04:13:18,597
[SPEAKER_64]: In fear, I think that we should govern in values.

2462
04:13:19,578 --> 04:13:23,899
[SPEAKER_64]: As one councilor, this ordinance is certainly in accordance with my own values.

2463
04:13:25,159 --> 04:13:32,060
[SPEAKER_64]: And I believe the question of whether this will be net harmful to our city is settled and that this is well worth doing.

2464
04:13:34,261 --> 04:13:40,262
[SPEAKER_64]: Furthermore, and I feel like I say this a lot, but I also feel like it's important to say, so I'm going to keep saying it even though it's uncomfortable.

2465
04:13:42,140 --> 04:13:53,048
[SPEAKER_64]: As a Jew, as the only Jewish member of this body, I grow increasingly weary with having to defend justice and security-oriented policies from accusations of anti-Semitism.

2466
04:13:54,169 --> 04:14:06,679
[SPEAKER_64]: As one person, this policy is foundationally aligned with my Jewish faith and with the imperative to repair the world, tikkun olam, the value with which I was raised in my Jewish family.

2467
04:14:09,941 --> 04:14:21,224
[SPEAKER_64]: I think that the conversation we have had in this chambers over several meetings about this ordinance and other resolutions like it are a microcosm of the community that we share, but not in a bad way.

2468
04:14:22,685 --> 04:14:30,427
[SPEAKER_64]: I admit, and this will not be a surprise to people who have heard me speak about this before, that I feel offended

2469
04:14:32,475 --> 04:14:49,764
[SPEAKER_64]: and saddened to know that there are people with whom I share a Jewish identity who see me as illegitimate or claiming a Jewish identity that is not mine, because I do not share their politics and ideology about Zionism and the state of Israel.

2470
04:14:50,704 --> 04:14:57,488
[SPEAKER_64]: However, and I know that there are many, many Jews of many politics and ideologies who also feel this way,

2471
04:15:00,498 --> 04:15:10,603
[SPEAKER_64]: Though I do not share an ideology with Zionist Jews, I would never purport to say that I do not share that identity with you and that you are not a part of my community.

2472
04:15:12,884 --> 04:15:19,468
[SPEAKER_64]: In the same way, in this chamber, on this issue and on many others, we have come together to vehemently disagree.

2473
04:15:21,092 --> 04:15:24,553
[SPEAKER_64]: and we are still a part of the same Medford community.

2474
04:15:24,974 --> 04:15:30,536
[SPEAKER_64]: We have heard a lot of talk, especially this term, about division and divisiveness.

2475
04:15:31,116 --> 04:15:36,858
[SPEAKER_64]: Coming together to disagree is not necessarily harmful.

2476
04:15:37,438 --> 04:15:42,500
[SPEAKER_64]: That is not a type of division that we can ever or should ever try to avoid.

2477
04:15:43,741 --> 04:15:46,622
[SPEAKER_64]: Being divided on an issue, disagreeing vehemently,

2478
04:15:47,575 --> 04:15:54,398
[SPEAKER_64]: even with people with whom you share a community and history and nevertheless coming together to debate and disagree in public.

2479
04:15:56,879 --> 04:16:00,260
[SPEAKER_64]: It's okay if we want to call that divisiveness, but I don't think that's bad.

2480
04:16:00,320 --> 04:16:01,381
[SPEAKER_64]: I think that's what we do here.

2481
04:16:01,401 --> 04:16:16,467
[SPEAKER_64]: And it's sad to me that these productive conversations and this exercise of continuing to come together and disagree over and over and over and over and over again is somehow being branded as wrong or harmful.

2482
04:16:17,297 --> 04:16:18,537
[SPEAKER_64]: This is how it's supposed to work.

2483
04:16:18,557 --> 04:16:32,061
[SPEAKER_64]: I want to thank everybody for their comments tonight, including those with whom I disagree, and including those who vehemently disagree with me, even insofar as to call my identity illegitimate.

2484
04:16:33,401 --> 04:16:35,122
[SPEAKER_64]: I hope to see you again in the chambers very soon.

2485
04:16:51,357 --> 04:16:52,018
[SPEAKER_69]: On the motion.

2486
04:16:56,601 --> 04:16:59,623
[SPEAKER_64]: On the motion by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

2487
04:17:01,024 --> 04:17:02,425
[SPEAKER_64]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

2488
04:17:03,306 --> 04:17:03,946
[SPEAKER_68]: President Bears?

2489
04:17:04,186 --> 04:17:04,366
[SPEAKER_70]: Yeah.

2490
04:17:06,828 --> 04:17:07,929
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Callahan is absent.

2491
04:17:09,630 --> 04:17:10,331
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Lazzaro?

2492
04:17:10,351 --> 04:17:10,491
[SPEAKER_68]: Yeah.

2493
04:17:12,072 --> 04:17:12,692
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Leming?

2494
04:17:12,712 --> 04:17:14,534
[SPEAKER_68]: Yeah.

2495
04:17:14,554 --> 04:17:15,274
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2496
04:17:15,294 --> 04:17:15,995
[SPEAKER_68]: No.

2497
04:17:17,356 --> 04:17:17,996
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Tseng?

2498
04:17:18,757 --> 04:17:18,937
[SPEAKER_68]: Yes.

2499
04:17:21,081 --> 04:17:21,902
[SPEAKER_68]: Vice President Collins.

2500
04:17:22,422 --> 04:17:22,622
[SPEAKER_64]: Yes.

2501
04:17:23,263 --> 04:17:25,845
[SPEAKER_64]: Five in favor, one opposed, one absent.

2502
04:17:26,325 --> 04:17:27,106
[SPEAKER_64]: The motion passes.

2503
04:17:36,233 --> 04:17:39,356
[SPEAKER_64]: Is there a motion for a five minute recess?

2504
04:17:40,777 --> 04:17:46,341
[SPEAKER_64]: Motion for a five minute recess by President Bears, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

2505
04:17:46,922 --> 04:17:48,023
[SPEAKER_64]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready.

2506
04:17:54,920 --> 04:17:56,582
[SPEAKER_64]: There will be a five minute recess.

2507
04:17:56,643 --> 04:17:57,003
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

2508
04:17:57,224 --> 04:17:57,845
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll reconvene.

2509
04:29:28,886 --> 04:29:36,053
[SPEAKER_64]: All right, we're going to reconvene just as soon as I find my right page, actually.

2510
04:29:49,065 --> 04:29:49,425
[SPEAKER_64]: All right.

2511
04:29:51,512 --> 04:29:52,833
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you all for your patience.

2512
04:29:54,395 --> 04:29:59,820
[SPEAKER_64]: Paper 25-123 offered by President Bears.

2513
04:30:01,461 --> 04:30:09,629
[SPEAKER_64]: Resolution on a shared path forward to extend rezoning project timeline and request necessary funding and resources from mayor.

2514
04:30:11,650 --> 04:30:27,098
[SPEAKER_64]: Whereas on July 16, 2025, the council president outlined a shared path forward for Medford's zoning updates project that outlined a clear and responsive approach to continuing this essential project to enable Medford's future growth and development.

2515
04:30:27,399 --> 04:30:38,345
[SPEAKER_64]: And whereas the specific zoning amendment proposals reflect hard work to make our city's vision and plans a reality over the past several years, starting with requests for funding for zoning updates prior to 2020,

2516
04:30:39,706 --> 04:31:04,868
[SPEAKER_64]: the initiation of the first phase of this project from 2020 to 2022 by recodifying the zoning ordinance, the planning processes between 2020 and 2024 to create the comprehensive plan, climate plan, and housing plan that incorporated input from thousands of residents and hundreds of public engagement events and approaches, and continuing over the past 18 months with the City Council and Mayor's Planning Department staff, Building Commissioner, Communications Director,

2517
04:31:05,868 --> 04:31:29,633
[SPEAKER_64]: and other city staff working with Innes Associates to create zoning proposals that concretely implement our city's plans, and whereas it is essential to the well-being of Medford residents and the future of our city that the Medford zoning ordinance is amended so that we can build more housing, create more vibrant commercial squares, and focus on mixed-use development that activates corridors of our city with so much potential that have been ignored for too long,

2518
04:31:30,493 --> 04:31:40,161
[SPEAKER_64]: And whereas after more than five years our community is in the hardest phase of this project, and we must secure the progress we all know Medford needs by seeing this work through to completion.

2519
04:31:40,861 --> 04:31:49,048
[SPEAKER_64]: And whereas for nearly two years, the Council Community Development Board and city staff have worked with the resources made available to us by the mayor.

2520
04:31:49,608 --> 04:32:07,983
[SPEAKER_64]: and have consistently and persistently advocated to the mayor to engage more deeply in the process, provide more city resources to ensure the success of this collaboration between the City Council and the mayor's administration, and work to ensure that accurate information reaches as many residents as possible to get them involved in this rezoning project.

2521
04:32:08,847 --> 04:32:22,433
[SPEAKER_64]: And whereas the mayor's written response on July 31 2025 contained inaccurate information and presented a narrative that does not correctly represent the mayor or her administration's core role in the zoning updates project since its beginning.

2522
04:32:23,233 --> 04:32:27,775
[SPEAKER_64]: And whereas the mayor's decision to limit her direct participation in this essential

2523
04:32:28,355 --> 04:32:39,764
[SPEAKER_64]: Major and transformative project until recently has been a barrier to accessing city communications resources under her control to ensure as many residents as possible are able to engage with this process.

2524
04:32:40,544 --> 04:32:47,189
[SPEAKER_64]: And whereas the proposed extended timeline was drafted with the specific intention of receiving collaborative input from the mayor.

2525
04:32:48,070 --> 04:33:09,731
[SPEAKER_64]: and whereas City Council leadership continues to extend its hand of open engagement and collaboration on the project as it has for newly two years and the Council President has offered times to sit with the Mayor to discuss the specifics regarding additional funding and resources for expanded public engagement to support the extended consideration of proposed zoning amendments

2526
04:33:10,471 --> 04:33:27,909
[SPEAKER_64]: And whereas the people of Medford have placed their trust in the elected members of the Medford City Council to update the Medford zoning ordinance and the City Council has conducted a robust and extensive process to propose zoning amendments with the resources provided and within the restrictions of the contract signed by the mayor.

2527
04:33:28,850 --> 04:33:53,405
[SPEAKER_64]: and whereas a potential decision by the mayor to end this zoning updates project by canceling the contract with the zoning consultant team and refusing to provide the resources and support necessary to implement the city's plans and address decades of inaction and broken zoning, which has caused harmful outcomes in all of our neighborhoods, would be a disservice to the city's residents and seriously damage the future of Medford,

2528
04:33:54,913 --> 04:34:22,312
[SPEAKER_64]: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we collaboratively establish an extended timeline for the consideration of the proposed residential districts and ADU zoning proposal, as well as off-street residential parking requirements with the mayor's office and planning team, which includes proposing a new draft no sooner than November 2025, after a series of neighborhood discussions to take place this fall, and any final City Council vote no sooner than April 2026.

2529
04:34:24,357 --> 04:34:45,756
[SPEAKER_64]: We have further resolved that the City Council requests that the Community Development Board continue its plan to meet on August 6, 2025, to provide direction regarding drafting of new recommendations for the residential district zoning proposal that incorporate the feedback provided by residents during the CDB's public hearings and discussions over the last several months to the City Council and planning team.

2530
04:34:47,371 --> 04:35:04,388
[SPEAKER_64]: Be it for the result that we request that the City Council Community Development Board and planning team, planning team prioritize completing the proposed commercial framework and focus on the remaining proposed districts for Medford Square West Medford Square, the other corridors and Tufts institutional zoning through the end of 2025.

2531
04:35:05,990 --> 04:35:23,167
[SPEAKER_64]: Be it further resolved that we request that the mayor allocate the necessary resources from the city's reserve funds to provide the Council Community Development Board planning team and city staff with the support needed to conduct even more robust public outreach over the next year, including subject to discussion.

2532
04:35:24,028 --> 04:35:46,755
[SPEAKER_64]: at least $150,000 in total funds including any funds currently appropriated in the fiscal year 26 budget to extend the city's contract with the Innes Associates team through December 2026 and additional $50,000 in funds to pay for communications to residents that are reviewed and approved by the consensus of all of the branches of the city leading the project

2533
04:35:47,475 --> 04:36:01,106
[SPEAKER_64]: Mayor's Office, City Council and Planning Department that help inform residents about the proposals and what opportunities they will have to make their voices heard and share their concerns, sorry, share their comments with the Community Development Board and the City Council.

2534
04:36:03,088 --> 04:36:03,649
[SPEAKER_64]: President Bears.

2535
04:36:07,111 --> 04:36:09,794
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope that was written dryly enough to not come off as mean.

2536
04:36:13,433 --> 04:36:29,457
[SPEAKER_24]: This ordinance work that we've been doing on the zoning is essential to the future of our city where as written and as we've discussed extensively in this body for the six years that I've served on it, our zoning is broken.

2537
04:36:29,797 --> 04:36:31,197
[SPEAKER_24]: People don't like the outcomes of it.

2538
04:36:31,597 --> 04:36:34,918
[SPEAKER_24]: It both allows things we don't want and doesn't allow things we do want.

2539
04:36:35,398 --> 04:36:39,219
[SPEAKER_24]: And it significantly hampers our ability to grow and develop as a community.

2540
04:36:40,565 --> 04:36:53,243
[SPEAKER_24]: We spent years following the rescission of the mystic Avenue proposal in 2019, doing a planning process to develop the housing plan the climate plan and of course the city's comprehensive plan.

2541
04:36:54,058 --> 04:37:01,523
[SPEAKER_24]: we conducted a two year zoning recodification to create a modern ordinance structure that this council approved unanimously under the previous council.

2542
04:37:02,464 --> 04:37:17,535
[SPEAKER_24]: And for the last 18 months, we have been working under the contract and funding provided by the mayor to implement the city's plans through updates to the zoning ordinance as outlined in the comprehensive plans implementation table.

2543
04:37:17,555 --> 04:37:17,575
[SPEAKER_24]: I

2544
04:37:20,137 --> 04:37:24,062
[SPEAKER_24]: wrote and delivered a seven page comment letter on the draft comprehensive plan.

2545
04:37:24,202 --> 04:37:36,836
[SPEAKER_24]: So I can tell you that I have read through it intensely and I can tell you that there was a lot about needs for change in our zoning to address the many issues, whether that's

2546
04:37:37,457 --> 04:37:53,827
[SPEAKER_24]: affordable housing, nonconforming structures, zoning that doesn't allow for mixed use districts, that doesn't allow us to create vibrant corridors and commercial squares, all the things that so many folks have been talking about that hold back this community in so many ways.

2547
04:37:54,787 --> 04:38:02,692
[SPEAKER_24]: I think most eloquently and elegantly represented in the new bank that is opening in the

2548
04:38:03,775 --> 04:38:07,298
[SPEAKER_24]: outfitted, formerly outfitted restaurant in Medford Square, right?

2549
04:38:08,258 --> 04:38:11,301
[SPEAKER_24]: If we don't do something significant, that's going to keep happening.

2550
04:38:11,621 --> 04:38:16,724
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is what our comprehensive plan said, and this zoning has been working to change.

2551
04:38:18,866 --> 04:38:24,510
[SPEAKER_24]: The ordinance lays out very clearly what has happened over the last 18 months.

2552
04:38:26,832 --> 04:38:29,534
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not going to get into the back and forth and the specifics.

2553
04:38:29,594 --> 04:38:32,636
[SPEAKER_24]: It's obvious that the mayor has a different narrative of what happened.

2554
04:38:34,842 --> 04:38:52,010
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that a lot more engagement and involvement and resources earlier on, I remember Council Vice President Collins, you send the communications last September trying to get the communication staff and team more involved in what we were doing would have helped.

2555
04:38:53,311 --> 04:39:02,055
[SPEAKER_24]: I do think that this, the zoning that we've proposed generally reflects both the comprehensive plan, the vision and the expert opinions of the planning team that we brought on board.

2556
04:39:03,665 --> 04:39:19,675
[SPEAKER_24]: And I do want to note that even in the absence of more resources and more direct engagement from the city administration, your efforts, Councilor Collins, did receive the praise and plaudits of the Mass Municipal Association, who highlighted our zoning website and communications plan this spring.

2557
04:39:20,355 --> 04:39:33,043
[SPEAKER_24]: But given that city government, even when we're talking about zoning, and even when we're talking about the city council, who does hold the primary responsibility for zoning, when other bodies of city government, the mayor, particularly,

2558
04:39:34,317 --> 04:39:34,497
[SPEAKER_24]: Um.

2559
04:39:37,078 --> 04:39:41,158
[SPEAKER_24]: Are calling for a different approach and a change in approach at this stage.

2560
04:39:41,379 --> 04:39:48,200
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think that we can move ahead without listening to that, particularly given the mayor's letter last week, which indicated that she would not provide.

2561
04:39:49,080 --> 04:39:52,481
[SPEAKER_24]: Our body with consulting and resource

2562
04:39:59,012 --> 04:40:05,258
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think that's particularly the best way to move forward because I don't think that ending the project at this stage was good for anyone.

2563
04:40:07,260 --> 04:40:09,202
[SPEAKER_24]: It leaves a lot of the broken zoning intact.

2564
04:40:09,422 --> 04:40:21,073
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, there are great improvements with Green Score and the new Mystic Avenue corridor and Salem Street, like it's a start, but leaving it in this stage would be pretty awful and kind of a worst of both worlds situation.

2565
04:40:22,360 --> 04:40:35,251
[SPEAKER_24]: Saying all of that and having written this ordinance in response to my commitment from my address to the community earlier in July, I will say that I did meet with the mayor for nearly two hours yesterday.

2566
04:40:35,271 --> 04:40:50,403
[SPEAKER_24]: We, I think, disagree on how we got here, agree that if we knew now, like if a year ago we had known what we know now, we would have approached this differently.

2567
04:40:52,140 --> 04:40:58,963
[SPEAKER_24]: and agree that I think that there is a path ahead, basically along the framework that I outlined and also that the mayor had outlined.

2568
04:40:59,664 --> 04:41:02,746
[SPEAKER_24]: We kind of ended up in one of those situations, Newton and Leibniz, right?

2569
04:41:02,786 --> 04:41:04,667
[SPEAKER_24]: They both invented calculus at the same time.

2570
04:41:05,988 --> 04:41:17,834
[SPEAKER_24]: The mayor sent a letter and I made a speech about 24 hours apart that said largely the same thing, even though obviously there were significant disagreements in accountability and who's responsible for what happened.

2571
04:41:18,975 --> 04:41:19,835
[SPEAKER_24]: All of that being said,

2572
04:41:22,152 --> 04:41:23,634
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we had a good meeting yesterday.

2573
04:41:24,495 --> 04:41:38,934
[SPEAKER_24]: I feel confident that we can work through disagreements and differences that we may have, create an agreement and a framework to extend our contract with the INIS associates team and move ahead on this essential project.

2574
04:41:40,125 --> 04:41:46,890
[SPEAKER_24]: and move ahead also with the knowledge of how we want to do that collaboratively going forward.

2575
04:41:47,010 --> 04:42:01,542
[SPEAKER_24]: So I feel confident about that, but I also think it's essential that we transmit to the mayor a communication that outlines what has happened over the last 18 months and what needs to change in order for us to

2576
04:42:02,654 --> 04:42:11,461
[SPEAKER_24]: continue to be successful and complete this important project that is really the foundation of our growth and development and a better future for our city.

2577
04:42:12,042 --> 04:42:12,402
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2578
04:42:14,384 --> 04:42:15,264
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, President Bears.

2579
04:42:15,425 --> 04:42:17,927
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go to Councilor Scarpelli and then to Councilor Lazzaro.

2580
04:42:18,947 --> 04:42:19,848
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2581
04:42:21,509 --> 04:42:26,514
[SPEAKER_29]: So I know my fellow Councilors mentioned how I love doing this now, so I'll share another one.

2582
04:42:27,134 --> 04:42:28,195
[SPEAKER_29]: This was from the Mayor.

2583
04:42:29,396 --> 04:42:31,818
[SPEAKER_29]: Today, hello President Bears of Medford City Council.

2584
04:42:32,767 --> 04:42:36,390
[SPEAKER_29]: I want to provide an update on a few things zoning related.

2585
04:42:37,190 --> 04:42:40,693
[SPEAKER_29]: First, in my opinion, the meeting between President Baez and I yesterday went well.

2586
04:42:40,713 --> 04:42:44,456
[SPEAKER_29]: It was a good start to work we all want to see accomplished.

2587
04:42:44,917 --> 04:42:52,963
[SPEAKER_29]: We will be working through the Ennis extension over the next few weeks in hopes to have an agreement so we can continue the work sometime after Labor Day.

2588
04:42:53,944 --> 04:43:01,850
[SPEAKER_29]: This will allow the city staff, community, CDB board a few weeks to breathe, catch and decompress from this stressful process.

2589
04:43:02,622 --> 04:43:22,050
[SPEAKER_29]: Considering there is not an active contract with Ennis, and my hope is that we create a new timeline for Ennis, and considering the fact that we have no, we have two members of the CD board whose terms expired on June 30, 2025, and are not seeking reappointment, I respectfully ask that you do not refer to the corridors out this evening, which you did.

2590
04:43:23,011 --> 04:43:26,132
[SPEAKER_29]: If I understood correctly, President Bears would like the CD board

2591
04:43:26,722 --> 04:43:31,946
[SPEAKER_29]: direction on residential discussions on 8-6 as well as to have them vote to extend the hearing.

2592
04:43:32,206 --> 04:43:33,327
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm okay with that approach.

2593
04:43:33,867 --> 04:43:42,453
[SPEAKER_29]: I just respectfully ask that your next meeting on September 9th to refer the residential and ADU discussions back to the City Council Committee for further study.

2594
04:43:43,094 --> 04:43:49,618
[SPEAKER_29]: We discussed and I hope you all agree that we should take the corridors first one at a time after the move on to residential parking.

2595
04:43:50,059 --> 04:43:54,762
[SPEAKER_29]: We also discussed my request to take CD board's final recommendation on Salem Street corridor.

2596
04:43:55,315 --> 04:44:02,761
[SPEAKER_29]: If so, I agree not to revisit Mr. Gav now, but to wait until after this included in a poll we discussed doing in the fall.

2597
04:44:03,001 --> 04:44:05,944
[SPEAKER_29]: If the poll shows we should revisit it, then we will.

2598
04:44:06,224 --> 04:44:07,565
[SPEAKER_29]: I appreciate your consideration.

2599
04:44:08,606 --> 04:44:10,948
[SPEAKER_29]: If you want to discuss this anytime, let me know.

2600
04:44:11,248 --> 04:44:19,975
[SPEAKER_29]: If we do this thoughtfully, without rushing, and with good communication at the forefront, I truly feel we'll accomplish the rezoning process.

2601
04:44:20,075 --> 04:44:20,916
[SPEAKER_29]: I just wanted to share that.

2602
04:44:21,676 --> 04:44:23,418
[SPEAKER_29]: And then I wanted to just share something that

2603
04:44:23,885 --> 04:44:45,053
[SPEAKER_29]: I know Councilor Bears said that, you know, the process in this whole zoning, I revert back to one of the first meetings that I mentioned, that part of the RFP that the former council wrote was a really in-depth process that we asked for the RFP to be written for the consultants

2604
04:44:46,245 --> 04:44:55,268
[SPEAKER_29]: to really put together a comprehensive plan that goes into the community to help and include those residents so they feel like they're part of the process.

2605
04:44:56,749 --> 04:45:01,170
[SPEAKER_29]: And what we're seeing with this council is that we're rushing through the process.

2606
04:45:02,471 --> 04:45:03,031
[SPEAKER_29]: And you know what?

2607
04:45:03,911 --> 04:45:05,052
[SPEAKER_29]: We didn't listen at Salem Street.

2608
04:45:06,012 --> 04:45:08,613
[SPEAKER_29]: You didn't listen to other corridors of this community.

2609
04:45:09,113 --> 04:45:10,694
[SPEAKER_29]: You didn't listen to the residents.

2610
04:45:11,294 --> 04:45:14,835
[SPEAKER_29]: But what happened was you went into the area and you started talking about

2611
04:45:16,558 --> 04:45:17,438
[SPEAKER_29]: single family homes.

2612
04:45:18,418 --> 04:45:20,059
[SPEAKER_29]: And then all of a sudden Medford woke up.

2613
04:45:21,019 --> 04:45:30,140
[SPEAKER_29]: Medford woke up to the point that we see yellow and black signs all over the city because they're upset about this administration, this team, this leadership team, and the lack of communication.

2614
04:45:31,661 --> 04:45:44,883
[SPEAKER_29]: President Villes went to the public the other day without this council knowing anything about it, presented a plan blaming whatever the path was, and I'm not a very big fan, we all know that, of this administration.

2615
04:45:46,263 --> 04:45:49,705
[SPEAKER_29]: But this is, make it clear, this is not this administration's fault.

2616
04:45:50,765 --> 04:45:56,088
[SPEAKER_29]: What we're seeing right now, the other day, it was political backpedaling.

2617
04:45:56,629 --> 04:46:00,231
[SPEAKER_29]: All we missed there was a little Michael Jackson, you guys doing backpedal.

2618
04:46:01,051 --> 04:46:04,553
[SPEAKER_29]: Because what we see is, we're getting nervous now.

2619
04:46:04,913 --> 04:46:06,954
[SPEAKER_29]: Because all of a sudden the residents are getting in your ears.

2620
04:46:07,334 --> 04:46:10,376
[SPEAKER_29]: It's coming to re-election time.

2621
04:46:11,317 --> 04:46:11,937
[SPEAKER_29]: And we're hearing.

2622
04:46:13,188 --> 04:46:14,469
[SPEAKER_29]: that, geez, you know what?

2623
04:46:14,709 --> 04:46:17,530
[SPEAKER_29]: We didn't listen to the override, but it passed, but it's hurting people.

2624
04:46:17,770 --> 04:46:18,331
[SPEAKER_29]: We didn't listen.

2625
04:46:19,531 --> 04:46:25,754
[SPEAKER_29]: The charter review, we have councilors members sitting here right here saying, we're not gonna support it, but we're not gonna go against it.

2626
04:46:26,855 --> 04:46:30,157
[SPEAKER_29]: But we've moved it through, and people are upset about it.

2627
04:46:30,937 --> 04:46:32,118
[SPEAKER_29]: Now it comes to the zoning.

2628
04:46:32,418 --> 04:46:39,241
[SPEAKER_29]: It's starting to affect, this process is now affecting what the fabric of this community is all about.

2629
04:46:40,382 --> 04:46:42,243
[SPEAKER_29]: And now people are getting nervous behind the rail.

2630
04:46:44,089 --> 04:46:49,713
[SPEAKER_29]: So let it be said, this is political backpedaling at its best.

2631
04:46:51,194 --> 04:46:56,758
[SPEAKER_29]: To say that we're doing this because the mayor didn't give you the tools, you didn't want the tools.

2632
04:46:58,499 --> 04:46:59,280
[SPEAKER_29]: You didn't want the tools.

2633
04:46:59,320 --> 04:47:06,825
[SPEAKER_29]: For months, we've talked and heard this council chair talk over and over again how we've had many, many community meetings when you didn't.

2634
04:47:08,021 --> 04:47:16,306
[SPEAKER_29]: But when you did have that one community meeting, because it was forced, and 220 people showed up at the Roberts Elementary School.

2635
04:47:16,546 --> 04:47:17,546
[SPEAKER_29]: 200 people showed up, excuse me.

2636
04:47:18,347 --> 04:47:23,249
[SPEAKER_29]: And they presented a plan to share what they felt were issues.

2637
04:47:24,390 --> 04:47:26,291
[SPEAKER_29]: And then it went to the Community Development Board, correct?

2638
04:47:26,971 --> 04:47:28,692
[SPEAKER_29]: And the Community Development Board listened to them.

2639
04:47:29,192 --> 04:47:32,294
[SPEAKER_29]: They didn't agree to everything they wanted, but they listened.

2640
04:47:33,275 --> 04:47:37,297
[SPEAKER_29]: So what the residents of Salem Street did is they came to this meeting one night.

2641
04:47:38,157 --> 04:47:41,260
[SPEAKER_29]: And at that meeting, they expressed their concerns.

2642
04:47:41,500 --> 04:47:45,103
[SPEAKER_29]: They expressed what the Community Development Board listened.

2643
04:47:45,904 --> 04:47:49,867
[SPEAKER_29]: And then they presented the changes the Community Development Board requested.

2644
04:47:50,188 --> 04:47:51,089
[SPEAKER_29]: And they felt confident.

2645
04:47:51,129 --> 04:47:52,930
[SPEAKER_29]: They felt, finally, someone listened.

2646
04:47:53,251 --> 04:47:58,916
[SPEAKER_29]: And we don't like everything, but at least we were part of the problem, we were part of the solution, and we were part of zoning our method.

2647
04:47:59,216 --> 04:48:00,197
[SPEAKER_29]: And they walked out of this room.

2648
04:48:02,045 --> 04:48:09,967
[SPEAKER_29]: And then roughly around this time, one of the Councilors decided to stand up and say, I want to eliminate what was just presented and go back to the original plan.

2649
04:48:11,267 --> 04:48:25,430
[SPEAKER_29]: And what happened then was this council voted 6-0 in favor of that Councilor to look at the residents that finally had a voice, that finally had a voice, and you just turned around and spit in their face and threw it away.

2650
04:48:26,210 --> 04:48:28,011
[SPEAKER_29]: So now here we are months later,

2651
04:48:29,052 --> 04:48:30,453
[SPEAKER_29]: looking at the same situation.

2652
04:48:30,793 --> 04:48:34,577
[SPEAKER_29]: But this time, the largest voting block in this community is upset.

2653
04:48:35,597 --> 04:48:39,220
[SPEAKER_29]: The largest voting block is standing up and saying, you're not listening to these residents.

2654
04:48:39,601 --> 04:48:40,682
[SPEAKER_29]: You're not listening to us.

2655
04:48:41,302 --> 04:48:42,743
[SPEAKER_29]: This city council isn't listening.

2656
04:48:43,444 --> 04:48:46,607
[SPEAKER_29]: So now we're going to put this plan in place, ask for more money.

2657
04:48:47,087 --> 04:48:48,048
[SPEAKER_29]: We're going to backpedal.

2658
04:48:48,328 --> 04:48:49,989
[SPEAKER_29]: We're going to say we need more resources.

2659
04:48:51,551 --> 04:48:52,932
[SPEAKER_29]: But all this is, say what it is.

2660
04:48:53,978 --> 04:49:00,040
[SPEAKER_29]: Once you get elected again, you're going to go back to doing whatever you want to do because your people voted for you to make this happen.

2661
04:49:00,760 --> 04:49:06,881
[SPEAKER_29]: Not for the whole community, not for what's best for the 60,000, but what's best for the 7,500 that voted for you.

2662
04:49:10,102 --> 04:49:21,905
[SPEAKER_29]: So if I sat idly by and just let this go through, then I would be void of my job responsibility as city councilor to enlighten everybody to see exactly what this is.

2663
04:49:22,998 --> 04:49:25,820
[SPEAKER_29]: This is exactly political backpedaling.

2664
04:49:26,761 --> 04:49:29,063
[SPEAKER_29]: Because you had that opportunity to prove to the city.

2665
04:49:30,044 --> 04:49:39,852
[SPEAKER_29]: When Salem Street came here, and they met with the Community Development Board, and they had serious concerns, and the Community Development Board, who were the professionals here, said, you know what, let's do that.

2666
04:49:41,033 --> 04:49:45,217
[SPEAKER_29]: And you listen to, look, late at night again, because no one's listening now, it's only a few people.

2667
04:49:47,058 --> 04:49:50,081
[SPEAKER_29]: But when everybody was gone, when everybody was gone,

2668
04:49:51,595 --> 04:49:54,257
[SPEAKER_29]: the voice came out to revert back.

2669
04:49:57,140 --> 04:50:00,423
[SPEAKER_29]: People went to bed that night thinking that this city council listened and you didn't.

2670
04:50:01,864 --> 04:50:16,436
[SPEAKER_29]: So this process, this dog and pony show that I watched the other day, all this is, is just the delay to get reelected and then go through again because you've already proven you're not listening to the residents of this community.

2671
04:50:16,937 --> 04:50:18,118
[SPEAKER_29]: You're simply not listening.

2672
04:50:19,894 --> 04:50:24,178
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's funny, God forbid anybody speaks against you behind the reel, what do they make?

2673
04:50:24,898 --> 04:50:29,302
[SPEAKER_29]: Things were delayed because a Councilor made a motion to table it.

2674
04:50:29,322 --> 04:50:30,082
[SPEAKER_29]: That's my right.

2675
04:50:31,464 --> 04:50:36,928
[SPEAKER_29]: That's the right, because these residents, the residents you're not listening to, they have to call somebody.

2676
04:50:38,670 --> 04:50:43,213
[SPEAKER_29]: And they have to want to make it so that people are listening to them.

2677
04:50:45,055 --> 04:50:46,436
[SPEAKER_29]: So we don't know what November brings.

2678
04:50:46,656 --> 04:50:47,397
[SPEAKER_29]: I might not be here.

2679
04:50:47,797 --> 04:50:48,558
[SPEAKER_29]: You might not be here.

2680
04:50:49,743 --> 04:51:03,506
[SPEAKER_29]: But what you should learn from this is that listen to your constituents, not the constituents that just voted you, but the people that live in this community, because you're not listening.

2681
04:51:06,267 --> 04:51:16,389
[SPEAKER_29]: So we could say whatever we want, we can play back any tape we want, but I brought this up from the first meeting when I said,

2682
04:51:17,342 --> 04:51:19,164
[SPEAKER_29]: We need a more comprehensive plan.

2683
04:51:19,624 --> 04:51:23,347
[SPEAKER_29]: And the answer to me that day was, that was with the last council.

2684
04:51:24,067 --> 04:51:31,233
[SPEAKER_29]: This council, along with the community development board director, put the RFP together that gave us what we had, and that's trash.

2685
04:51:32,434 --> 04:51:37,938
[SPEAKER_29]: And from what I read from the mayor, you better buckle up, because she's not going to bend.

2686
04:51:37,958 --> 04:51:38,599
[SPEAKER_29]: Because you know what?

2687
04:51:40,100 --> 04:51:45,224
[SPEAKER_29]: Unless this council, and I'll make the motion right now, that I make a motion that this council

2688
04:51:46,363 --> 04:51:49,926
[SPEAKER_29]: reverts back and opens up the Salem Street process again.

2689
04:51:49,946 --> 04:52:09,101
[SPEAKER_29]: Because if you truly want to be true to your words and want the process to work correctly and why we want to move forward in the right, in this path, whatever we're calling it, then let's make the motion and support it to revisit Salem Street and bring back what they asked for and what the Community Development Board supported.

2690
04:52:09,982 --> 04:52:10,622
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's do that.

2691
04:52:11,623 --> 04:52:13,965
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's show them just a sliver that we are listening.

2692
04:52:15,055 --> 04:52:17,116
[SPEAKER_29]: And maybe we could salvage this.

2693
04:52:18,096 --> 04:52:20,217
[SPEAKER_29]: Because right now, there's no faith in this.

2694
04:52:21,358 --> 04:52:27,120
[SPEAKER_29]: There's no faith in our community development leader, Alicia Hunt, and there's no faith in this council.

2695
04:52:29,461 --> 04:52:33,003
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe you have people who are whispering in your ear that that's all not true, but guess what?

2696
04:52:33,423 --> 04:52:33,863
[SPEAKER_29]: It's true.

2697
04:52:35,324 --> 04:52:38,245
[SPEAKER_29]: So thank you and have a good night.

2698
04:52:38,905 --> 04:52:39,826
[SPEAKER_64]: One voice, thank you.

2699
04:52:41,727 --> 04:52:44,448
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go to Councilor Lazzaro, then back to President Bears.

2700
04:52:46,538 --> 04:52:47,058
[SPEAKER_60]: Thank you.

2701
04:52:49,761 --> 04:53:11,058
[SPEAKER_60]: The mayor wrote a letter saying that we needed to reverse two of the measures that we've already voted into law, Mystic Ave and Salem Street.

2702
04:53:12,130 --> 04:53:22,658
[SPEAKER_60]: And then in her first letter said that we also had to throw out all of the maps for residential zoning that we have at all.

2703
04:53:24,120 --> 04:53:26,321
[SPEAKER_60]: Just throw them away and start over.

2704
04:53:27,262 --> 04:53:40,813
[SPEAKER_60]: But those maps were created over the course of a long period of time with her own planning department staff and consultation with

2705
04:53:41,888 --> 04:53:49,170
[SPEAKER_60]: people that came in through an RFP before I even came on the council, and it's not going particularly fast.

2706
04:53:49,270 --> 04:53:53,251
[SPEAKER_60]: We've had 25 planning and permitting meetings on this topic, I think you said earlier, 31.

2707
04:53:53,291 --> 04:54:06,295
[SPEAKER_60]: Planning and permitting meetings, those are all public meetings that are, they're advertised on the website, and please don't interrupt me, because I didn't interrupt you.

2708
04:54:06,655 --> 04:54:06,935
[SPEAKER_60]: That's okay.

2709
04:54:08,736 --> 04:54:09,777
[SPEAKER_60]: They're all public meetings.

2710
04:54:09,897 --> 04:54:11,077
[SPEAKER_60]: They're advertised on the website.

2711
04:54:11,757 --> 04:54:19,140
[SPEAKER_60]: The mayor's communications team can decide to publicize anything that they like to publicize.

2712
04:54:19,320 --> 04:54:25,882
[SPEAKER_60]: They put a letter in my tax bill that said, there's a scary zoning thing happening.

2713
04:54:26,262 --> 04:54:26,982
[SPEAKER_60]: I received it.

2714
04:54:27,142 --> 04:54:29,743
[SPEAKER_60]: It said a scary zoning thing is happening, basically.

2715
04:54:30,980 --> 04:54:35,562
[SPEAKER_60]: And I got it in my house, and I said, what scary zoning thing is happening?

2716
04:54:35,602 --> 04:54:40,445
[SPEAKER_60]: The thing we've been working on for years is, yes, it's been ongoing.

2717
04:54:41,125 --> 04:54:44,387
[SPEAKER_60]: I wasn't aware that we were sending out letters all of a sudden.

2718
04:54:45,407 --> 04:54:49,069
[SPEAKER_60]: This would have been nice for people to know about a long time ago.

2719
04:54:49,089 --> 04:54:50,270
[SPEAKER_60]: They could know about the green score.

2720
04:54:50,850 --> 04:54:51,830
[SPEAKER_60]: They could have weighed in on that.

2721
04:54:54,397 --> 04:55:06,461
[SPEAKER_60]: I, an 80 year old woman that I know from my church just sent me an email because she sent it to everybody on our church lift serve today that she got a robo call that it's really important that everybody go to the CDB meeting tomorrow.

2722
04:55:07,001 --> 04:55:10,242
[SPEAKER_60]: She got a robo call about it because there are big, scary zoning changes happening.

2723
04:55:10,262 --> 04:55:13,783
[SPEAKER_60]: This is an extremely progressive woman who is saying like, use your voice.

2724
04:55:13,803 --> 04:55:14,943
[SPEAKER_60]: They're going to be more cars.

2725
04:55:14,983 --> 04:55:17,344
[SPEAKER_60]: They're going to give handouts to developers.

2726
04:55:18,665 --> 04:55:19,685
[SPEAKER_60]: She got a robo call today.

2727
04:55:19,705 --> 04:55:23,186
[SPEAKER_60]: This is a woman I know.

2728
04:55:24,959 --> 04:55:27,280
[SPEAKER_60]: I like, what's going out?

2729
04:55:27,460 --> 04:55:30,701
[SPEAKER_60]: What's the communication scheme exactly?

2730
04:55:31,202 --> 04:55:37,884
[SPEAKER_60]: And when the mayor says, oh, okay, well, I'll compromise.

2731
04:55:38,104 --> 04:55:44,907
[SPEAKER_60]: You only have to change one of the things you've already voted into law, change it back.

2732
04:55:45,107 --> 04:55:52,170
[SPEAKER_60]: So my compromise for you now is to, I'll be bad cop and then I'll be like slightly less bad cop.

2733
04:55:53,457 --> 04:55:55,079
[SPEAKER_60]: I'm not comfortable with that.

2734
04:55:55,519 --> 04:55:59,343
[SPEAKER_60]: The City Council's obligation is to do zoning.

2735
04:55:59,803 --> 04:56:14,478
[SPEAKER_60]: When the mayor put out a policy for a comprehensive plan and a housing production plan and an environmental plan, a climate action plan, and then we take on the responsibility of the City Council to enact those plans,

2736
04:56:15,656 --> 04:56:17,177
[SPEAKER_60]: And then she says, whoa, whoa, whoa.

2737
04:56:17,758 --> 04:56:33,293
[SPEAKER_60]: Once the community finds out about it and feels upset and needs to be talked to and needs to understand more about what it is, I've had to explain what zoning is to close friends of mine this week.

2738
04:56:34,454 --> 04:56:38,378
[SPEAKER_60]: There's a lot of communication that needs to happen and we do not have staff on the city council.

2739
04:56:39,683 --> 04:56:42,425
[SPEAKER_60]: We are individual operators.

2740
04:56:43,105 --> 04:56:44,386
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't even have, I don't have anything.

2741
04:56:44,406 --> 04:56:45,106
[SPEAKER_60]: I don't have anybody.

2742
04:56:45,747 --> 04:56:57,434
[SPEAKER_60]: And she has a communications department, which we have not been able to utilize until the mayor decided it was time to tell everybody that there are scary zoning changes happening.

2743
04:56:57,795 --> 04:56:59,136
[SPEAKER_60]: And now everybody is scared.

2744
04:57:00,249 --> 04:57:09,275
[SPEAKER_60]: So, no, I do not think it is appropriate for us to go back and change the things we've already voted into law we've, we were voted into office to do the things that we said we were going to do.

2745
04:57:09,755 --> 04:57:17,421
[SPEAKER_60]: And many of us said, something that we were going to do that was important for us to do is to bring in commercial, the capacity to build

2746
04:57:18,962 --> 04:57:22,104
[SPEAKER_60]: business districts that are logical, that makes sense.

2747
04:57:22,384 --> 04:57:23,645
[SPEAKER_60]: We have proximity to Boston.

2748
04:57:23,685 --> 04:57:30,650
[SPEAKER_60]: We could have vibrant business districts, and that will bring in tax revenue, and that will bolster the services that we can offer to our vulnerable residents.

2749
04:57:30,671 --> 04:57:33,893
[SPEAKER_60]: We can build up City Hall so that we can... These are my goals.

2750
04:57:34,373 --> 04:57:35,154
[SPEAKER_60]: I'll speak for myself.

2751
04:57:35,874 --> 04:57:43,100
[SPEAKER_60]: I would like to offer more services to our vulnerable residents in Medford, and that is why I think it would be great if we had more commercial tax revenue.

2752
04:57:43,772 --> 04:57:54,675
[SPEAKER_60]: And I also think it would be great if the 7,500 people who are qualified for affordable housing in Medford and do not have it, I think it would be nice if they had somewhere to live.

2753
04:57:56,180 --> 04:58:00,081
[SPEAKER_60]: So I think we should have a little bit more dense housing close to transit hubs.

2754
04:58:00,321 --> 04:58:01,801
[SPEAKER_60]: Yes, I think that that is true.

2755
04:58:01,901 --> 04:58:06,502
[SPEAKER_60]: And I ran on that and I will continue to try to make that happen.

2756
04:58:06,582 --> 04:58:11,203
[SPEAKER_60]: And if that one of the things that we can do to make these things possible is zoning changes.

2757
04:58:11,543 --> 04:58:15,183
[SPEAKER_60]: So all of these things, yes, all of these things are still true and they were always true.

2758
04:58:15,743 --> 04:58:20,724
[SPEAKER_60]: So when the mayor says a bunch of stuff about how it went too fast, it all went too fast.

2759
04:58:20,764 --> 04:58:22,785
[SPEAKER_60]: This was all true the whole time.

2760
04:58:23,385 --> 04:58:25,205
[SPEAKER_60]: And it's a slow process.

2761
04:58:26,609 --> 04:58:29,651
[SPEAKER_60]: And we can make it slower, but we can't throw it away.

2762
04:58:32,293 --> 04:58:33,554
[SPEAKER_60]: So I support this.

2763
04:58:34,294 --> 04:58:41,519
[SPEAKER_60]: I understand the necessity of slowing it down because we should have been communicating more.

2764
04:58:42,059 --> 04:58:44,901
[SPEAKER_60]: We should have had more money to communicate it.

2765
04:58:45,001 --> 04:58:46,082
[SPEAKER_60]: Maybe we didn't have it.

2766
04:58:47,883 --> 04:58:50,024
[SPEAKER_60]: We can't go back in time, so we can communicate now.

2767
04:58:51,425 --> 04:58:54,968
[SPEAKER_60]: That will require the mayor's partnership with intentionality.

2768
04:58:55,906 --> 04:58:58,848
[SPEAKER_60]: and it will require the mayor to do the things she says she's gonna do.

2769
04:59:03,050 --> 04:59:05,151
[SPEAKER_60]: If she wants to do them, great, I hope so.

2770
04:59:09,533 --> 04:59:10,174
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Councilor.

2771
04:59:10,214 --> 04:59:12,295
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go back to President Bears and then to Councilor Leming.

2772
04:59:14,276 --> 04:59:14,976
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

2773
04:59:14,996 --> 04:59:24,221
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it's just fundamentally true that it's hard to act in good faith and easy to act in bad faith.

2774
04:59:25,414 --> 04:59:37,237
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's hard to say we've learned that we should have done it better and it's easy to say, I told you so, or I trusted you too much, right?

2775
04:59:37,737 --> 04:59:39,657
[SPEAKER_24]: There are things that are hard and there are things that are easy.

2776
04:59:39,737 --> 04:59:42,078
[SPEAKER_24]: It's hard to say yes, it's easy to say no.

2777
04:59:44,018 --> 04:59:45,518
[SPEAKER_24]: And the city has said no a lot.

2778
04:59:46,699 --> 04:59:52,100
[SPEAKER_24]: City government said no to, we're not gonna update the zoning for,

2779
04:59:52,952 --> 04:59:53,232
[SPEAKER_24]: 30 years.

2780
04:59:53,353 --> 04:59:55,534
[SPEAKER_24]: No, we're not going to update the linkage fees for 30 years.

2781
04:59:55,614 --> 04:59:57,896
[SPEAKER_24]: No, we're not going to fix the sewer infrastructure for 30 years.

2782
04:59:57,976 --> 04:59:59,978
[SPEAKER_24]: No, we're not going to fix Menford Square for 30 years.

2783
05:00:00,058 --> 05:00:03,440
[SPEAKER_24]: No, we're not going to fix Mystic Ave for 30 years.

2784
05:00:03,520 --> 05:00:05,042
[SPEAKER_24]: And no, we're not going to fund the schools.

2785
05:00:05,102 --> 05:00:06,723
[SPEAKER_24]: And no, we're not going to maintain our buildings.

2786
05:00:06,783 --> 05:00:08,144
[SPEAKER_24]: And no, we're not going to build housing.

2787
05:00:08,164 --> 05:00:10,286
[SPEAKER_24]: And here we are, we're in the product of a city of no.

2788
05:00:10,306 --> 05:00:19,673
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a city in crisis, a city with decades of deferred maintenance, a city with no real plan and executed plan for growth, a city with

2789
05:00:21,689 --> 05:00:24,632
[SPEAKER_24]: out of date and broken institutions and structures.

2790
05:00:25,092 --> 05:00:31,939
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know, if the city hadn't said no for 20, 30 years that I grew up here, I probably wouldn't have run for office.

2791
05:00:34,541 --> 05:00:35,963
[SPEAKER_24]: I want to live in a city that says yes.

2792
05:00:36,943 --> 05:00:46,713
[SPEAKER_24]: City that doesn't defer and delay and deny the essential and fundamental reality that we have to do something or else everything falls apart.

2793
05:00:48,328 --> 05:00:52,330
[SPEAKER_24]: As I said, it's easy to act in bad faith and it's hard to act in good faith.

2794
05:00:53,551 --> 05:01:03,076
[SPEAKER_24]: And fundamentally, when we wanna talk about the lie that this council didn't adopt the Salem Street recommendations, we adopted all but one.

2795
05:01:03,096 --> 05:01:07,319
[SPEAKER_24]: I think there were 12 recommendations and this council adopted 11.

2796
05:01:08,559 --> 05:01:10,501
[SPEAKER_24]: So 11 twelfths means we're not listening.

2797
05:01:12,242 --> 05:01:12,882
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a lie.

2798
05:01:13,615 --> 05:01:23,882
[SPEAKER_24]: When we talk about the RFP had the community meetings when the council voted unanimously to accept a proposal that didn't have the community meetings because we only got two proposals because there wasn't enough money.

2799
05:01:26,624 --> 05:01:28,585
[SPEAKER_24]: Unanimously voted for that, it's a lie.

2800
05:01:32,147 --> 05:01:35,970
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's a lie for political gain and I get it, it's politics, fine.

2801
05:01:37,471 --> 05:01:41,794
[SPEAKER_24]: It's easy to act in bad faith and it's hard to act in good faith.

2802
05:01:45,238 --> 05:01:46,119
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see where it goes.

2803
05:01:46,219 --> 05:01:49,241
[SPEAKER_24]: If the mayor wants to end the zoning project, that's her prerogative.

2804
05:01:49,321 --> 05:01:50,903
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we're gonna get to a good outcome.

2805
05:01:51,523 --> 05:01:54,165
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think we're gonna relitigate what doesn't need to be relitigated.

2806
05:01:54,205 --> 05:01:59,810
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think we're gonna move forward, hopefully now, with the resources we all see we need.

2807
05:02:03,573 --> 05:02:09,718
[SPEAKER_24]: The resources that weren't in the proposal that was unanimously accepted by the council, even though they were in the RFP, right?

2808
05:02:10,038 --> 05:02:11,499
[SPEAKER_24]: An RFP is a request for proposal.

2809
05:02:12,160 --> 05:02:14,402
[SPEAKER_24]: We didn't vote on the RFP, we voted on the proposal, we got back.

2810
05:02:16,517 --> 05:02:25,701
[SPEAKER_24]: And that proposal didn't have everything we wanted and asked for, because everything we wanted and asked for wasn't possible with $150,000 over 18 months.

2811
05:02:27,461 --> 05:02:32,283
[SPEAKER_24]: At the time, we accepted the contract and did our best with what we had.

2812
05:02:33,764 --> 05:02:35,665
[SPEAKER_24]: Pretty early on, there were different approaches.

2813
05:02:35,745 --> 05:02:41,867
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli had one, Councilor Collins had another, I had another, Councilor Leming had another to try to fill the gaps.

2814
05:02:44,348 --> 05:02:46,029
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought we did a very good job of that.

2815
05:02:49,207 --> 05:03:08,103
[SPEAKER_24]: And up until really the end of June, when the mayor inserted herself in I think a not productive way, scaring people about what was happening and not presenting factual information and communications going out that didn't get looked at by any experts who were involved in the process.

2816
05:03:08,543 --> 05:03:11,366
[SPEAKER_24]: And then people coming and saying, look at all the horrible things that are happening.

2817
05:03:11,706 --> 05:03:13,147
[SPEAKER_24]: And none of them are actually in the zoning.

2818
05:03:14,288 --> 05:03:15,149
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what happened.

2819
05:03:17,706 --> 05:03:18,967
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, it's politics, right?

2820
05:03:19,807 --> 05:03:20,527
[SPEAKER_24]: It's politics.

2821
05:03:20,807 --> 05:03:22,168
[SPEAKER_24]: People are gonna say what they wanna say.

2822
05:03:23,588 --> 05:03:24,309
[SPEAKER_24]: Change is hard.

2823
05:03:25,069 --> 05:03:27,910
[SPEAKER_24]: It's easier to act in bad faith than it's hard to act in good faith.

2824
05:03:29,591 --> 05:03:30,911
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we're gonna get to an agreement.

2825
05:03:31,632 --> 05:03:35,093
[SPEAKER_24]: As I said, the mayor and I fundamentally disagree on the narrative of how we got here.

2826
05:03:35,994 --> 05:03:46,358
[SPEAKER_24]: But again, the political arguments being presented that no one was listened to and nothing ever happened and we knew this from the beginning and you did it on purpose, they are lies.

2827
05:03:48,598 --> 05:03:49,959
[SPEAKER_24]: they are actively lies.

2828
05:03:50,459 --> 05:04:07,272
[SPEAKER_24]: And the hypocrisy is so deep that when we voted unanimously to accept the proposal that didn't have the meetings that Councilor Schapiro mentions, then why did we vote to accept that proposal in the first place?

2829
05:04:07,312 --> 05:04:08,933
[SPEAKER_24]: Why wasn't this concern raised from day one?

2830
05:04:08,973 --> 05:04:14,957
[SPEAKER_24]: If we have the precognition and the forethought and the vision to have known that we would be where we were now then, I wish someone had spoken up.

2831
05:04:15,218 --> 05:04:15,618
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't know.

2832
05:04:16,600 --> 05:04:18,101
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, you didn't, you voted for it, George.

2833
05:04:18,502 --> 05:04:20,884
[SPEAKER_24]: So you did.

2834
05:04:21,744 --> 05:04:22,045
[SPEAKER_64]: Okay.

2835
05:04:22,765 --> 05:04:31,333
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, important things can't just be delayed because we don't have the resources.

2836
05:04:31,393 --> 05:04:32,894
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what this city has done forever.

2837
05:04:33,074 --> 05:04:37,017
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's led us to where we are, which is so much work that we have to do.

2838
05:04:38,559 --> 05:04:44,524
[SPEAKER_24]: A council that in one term is trying to do the work of 20 terms before that didn't get done.

2839
05:04:47,444 --> 05:04:49,205
[SPEAKER_24]: I think the residents can see what's happening.

2840
05:04:49,245 --> 05:04:50,966
[SPEAKER_24]: I think they're very smart.

2841
05:04:51,846 --> 05:05:07,794
[SPEAKER_24]: If you look at what residents are seeing and saying, even residents who are coordinating the slow down residential zoning signs, I've had meetings with some of the people coordinating that who say, actually, we mostly agree on most of this and the process wasn't good.

2842
05:05:07,854 --> 05:05:10,875
[SPEAKER_24]: And the communications from the city really freaked me out.

2843
05:05:13,456 --> 05:05:16,618
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank you for saying what you said, because it addresses some of my concerns.

2844
05:05:18,299 --> 05:05:21,586
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not a response to people saying, I'm not going to vote for you anymore.

2845
05:05:22,548 --> 05:05:23,230
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't vote for me.

2846
05:05:24,894 --> 05:05:26,477
[SPEAKER_24]: Take that clip, put it out, right?

2847
05:05:26,557 --> 05:05:27,339
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope someone does it.

2848
05:05:30,752 --> 05:05:32,032
[SPEAKER_24]: you know, that's great.

2849
05:05:32,152 --> 05:05:33,613
[SPEAKER_24]: If you don't agree with me, don't vote for me.

2850
05:05:33,673 --> 05:05:40,914
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think residents by and large, see that we are working in good faith to do very difficult things that the city does not done in decades.

2851
05:05:41,594 --> 05:05:51,155
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know, there will always be criticism, it will never be done perfectly, we will never agree on the outcome 100% behind this rail or the public at large.

2852
05:05:52,916 --> 05:05:59,957
[SPEAKER_24]: But I think most people can see that it wasn't intentionally, we never did this to push through a thing that nobody wants, right?

2853
05:06:00,907 --> 05:06:02,788
[SPEAKER_24]: If that was true, the overrides would have failed.

2854
05:06:02,888 --> 05:06:05,008
[SPEAKER_24]: If that was true, this council would never been elected.

2855
05:06:05,088 --> 05:06:11,270
[SPEAKER_24]: If that was true, we wouldn't see the results that we're seeing, which is that by and large, the city wants to move forward.

2856
05:06:12,991 --> 05:06:21,433
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm confident that we will be able to work together with the mayor on this piece of that project and move forward in a positive way.

2857
05:06:21,673 --> 05:06:22,013
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2858
05:06:24,274 --> 05:06:24,614
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

2859
05:06:24,854 --> 05:06:27,515
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go next to Councilor Leming and then Councilor Tseng on Zoom.

2860
05:06:30,584 --> 05:06:45,597
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, the wisdom that I've gained on my one term thus far in city council, what I've learned is that pretty much everything about this position incentivizes you to do nothing because anytime you make a

2861
05:06:48,308 --> 05:06:50,810
[SPEAKER_25]: make a decision, it'll anger somebody.

2862
05:06:50,830 --> 05:07:04,299
[SPEAKER_25]: I was just at an event right before I came here, and a city councilor in another city said a quote, which I think I'm going to start using now, and I'm going to steal it from him.

2863
05:07:04,320 --> 05:07:08,823
[SPEAKER_25]: He said, the only thing people hate worse than a problem is a solution.

2864
05:07:10,325 --> 05:07:13,907
[SPEAKER_25]: And I think that that summed it up very well.

2865
05:07:15,288 --> 05:07:22,192
[SPEAKER_25]: Everything about this job incentivizes us to say nice things to residents, to tell them what they want to hear.

2866
05:07:24,133 --> 05:07:28,055
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing about this job incentivizes us to actually make a decision.

2867
05:07:28,095 --> 05:07:30,236
[SPEAKER_25]: The overrides were a decision.

2868
05:07:31,257 --> 05:07:32,898
[SPEAKER_25]: It was our decision to put that on the ballot.

2869
05:07:32,918 --> 05:07:35,959
[SPEAKER_25]: It was the decision of the rest of the city to vote on it.

2870
05:07:37,865 --> 05:07:59,032
[SPEAKER_25]: people that many people who voted on it were on a fixed income, and it put an extra burden on them, but it ended up saving 40 teaching jobs and invested in a road crew that will end up repairing the streets at a faster rate.

2871
05:08:00,593 --> 05:08:00,913
[SPEAKER_25]: It is

2872
05:08:02,070 --> 05:08:05,372
[SPEAKER_25]: very hard to actually do something productive.

2873
05:08:05,412 --> 05:08:08,833
[SPEAKER_25]: It's very hard to build something.

2874
05:08:08,893 --> 05:08:15,797
[SPEAKER_25]: It's very easy to throw a wrench into the clockwork and try to stop everything.

2875
05:08:15,837 --> 05:08:26,822
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's easy to do that if you have the resources to make robo calls and send out emails to a wide portion of the city.

2876
05:08:28,082 --> 05:08:30,904
[SPEAKER_25]: It's much easier to do that than it is to actually

2877
05:08:31,684 --> 05:08:32,544
[SPEAKER_25]: build something.

2878
05:08:33,205 --> 05:08:52,613
[SPEAKER_25]: So another thing I'll say is that, you know, people, people in local elected office, we tend to just doing this stuff, you tend to learn, learn a lot of technical details, like the fact that we didn't just have one q&a session we had, there were like six, and they're like, five of them are on YouTube right now.

2879
05:08:53,193 --> 05:09:00,076
[SPEAKER_25]: Like the fact that during the when we adopted 11 out of 12 of the proposals from the Salem Street,

2880
05:09:02,310 --> 05:09:07,534
[SPEAKER_25]: a huge number of residents were literally asking us to do just that, that evening.

2881
05:09:08,334 --> 05:09:15,179
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's little technical details that most people don't know, but we're aware of that you could just sort of ignore when you're making a narrative.

2882
05:09:17,080 --> 05:09:25,286
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's very easy to just not actually be honest about those little details when you're telling people.

2883
05:09:26,960 --> 05:09:27,781
[SPEAKER_25]: what's going on.

2884
05:09:27,801 --> 05:09:29,944
[SPEAKER_25]: And what's happening.

2885
05:09:30,424 --> 05:09:40,916
[SPEAKER_25]: And you know, I'm, I mean, I, I live on Salem Street, I'm talking to a lot of my neighbors on Salem Street, a lot of them, a lot of them like the rezoning, a lot of them didn't.

2886
05:09:41,817 --> 05:09:41,978
[SPEAKER_25]: And

2887
05:09:42,638 --> 05:09:47,000
[SPEAKER_25]: A lot of them appreciate what I said during council meetings.

2888
05:09:47,501 --> 05:09:52,603
[SPEAKER_25]: A lot of them thought that I could have could have phrased it differently and I appreciate all of that.

2889
05:09:53,224 --> 05:09:58,106
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sending out a press release, telling a legislative body to undo.

2890
05:09:59,827 --> 05:10:07,548
[SPEAKER_25]: things that have already been ordained as asinine, that is not an approach of somebody who is working in good faith.

2891
05:10:09,169 --> 05:10:12,769
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't appreciate that game of chicken.

2892
05:10:13,469 --> 05:10:27,312
[SPEAKER_25]: I understand that Council President Bears's speech that he gave out to the city, it was sort of a public way to, it was sort of like a public way for council to

2893
05:10:28,467 --> 05:10:30,028
[SPEAKER_25]: express what our path forward was.

2894
05:10:30,088 --> 05:10:35,830
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the response to that, especially if you read the whole thing, was not any sort of an olive branch.

2895
05:10:36,531 --> 05:10:38,751
[SPEAKER_25]: It was a middle finger in response to that.

2896
05:10:38,771 --> 05:10:53,438
[SPEAKER_25]: And the fact that it was done two days after nomination papers closed and the mayor knew she wouldn't have to run against anybody was like an extra cherry on top of that sundae.

2897
05:10:54,238 --> 05:10:58,181
[SPEAKER_25]: So yeah, there's a lot that can be said about this process.

2898
05:10:58,221 --> 05:11:01,723
[SPEAKER_25]: I've heard the different narratives thrown around time and time again.

2899
05:11:01,744 --> 05:11:12,411
[SPEAKER_25]: It gets repetitive after a while, but I always appreciate talking to residents about what's happening with

2900
05:11:14,050 --> 05:11:22,776
[SPEAKER_25]: the rezoning, I understand that there's a lot more work that needs to be done in coming up with a vision that the highest number of people can agree on.

2901
05:11:23,016 --> 05:11:31,142
[SPEAKER_25]: And I look forward to engaging in that process in good faith.

2902
05:11:31,683 --> 05:11:34,925
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you for everybody who's listening at 12 in the morning.

2903
05:11:35,846 --> 05:11:37,106
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm gonna shut up now.

2904
05:11:39,568 --> 05:11:40,469
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

2905
05:11:41,770 --> 05:11:43,311
[SPEAKER_64]: Councilor Tseng, I saw you had a hand up earlier.

2906
05:11:45,485 --> 05:11:45,905
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2907
05:11:46,365 --> 05:11:55,508
[SPEAKER_37]: I think my family Councilors have spoken to the revisionism and the campaigning that we've been seeing.

2908
05:11:56,328 --> 05:12:00,590
[SPEAKER_37]: And so I'm going to refocus on the resolution that's right in front of us.

2909
05:12:02,690 --> 05:12:05,831
[SPEAKER_37]: I've spent the last month and a half reading everyone's emails.

2910
05:12:06,151 --> 05:12:07,572
[SPEAKER_37]: I know I have a lot to get back to.

2911
05:12:08,943 --> 05:12:28,831
[SPEAKER_37]: But I wanted to take this time to listen to residents because there's just so many different perspectives, so many different views from people who think that our city isn't doing enough to build housing, to encourage more housing, to those who are concerned that we are moving too quickly.

2912
05:12:29,332 --> 05:12:33,693
[SPEAKER_37]: The truth is that there are a lot of people who feel strongly on every side about this issue.

2913
05:12:34,854 --> 05:12:37,295
[SPEAKER_37]: But in reading these emails,

2914
05:12:38,527 --> 05:12:47,775
[SPEAKER_37]: And looking past the disagreements that folks might have about process, I think that there are still many goals that unite our community.

2915
05:12:48,355 --> 05:12:50,317
[SPEAKER_37]: I think we want to make Medford more affordable.

2916
05:12:50,897 --> 05:12:53,860
[SPEAKER_37]: I think we want to make sure that we hold big developers accountable.

2917
05:12:54,460 --> 05:12:56,302
[SPEAKER_37]: And I think we want to fight against displacement.

2918
05:12:57,903 --> 05:13:06,951
[SPEAKER_37]: Speaking from personal experience and from talking to countless neighbors this year and over the last few years, I know too many folks are feeling the crunch.

2919
05:13:07,734 --> 05:13:09,514
[SPEAKER_37]: They're tired of seeing their rents rise.

2920
05:13:09,814 --> 05:13:13,195
[SPEAKER_37]: They're tired of seeing the dream of homeownership slip away.

2921
05:13:13,215 --> 05:13:23,497
[SPEAKER_37]: I know a lot of parents are tired of seeing their kids, folks I went to school with, have to move out to Central Mass or New Hampshire just because they can't afford to live here anymore.

2922
05:13:24,077 --> 05:13:28,718
[SPEAKER_37]: And simply put, we just have a system that doesn't work for us.

2923
05:13:29,618 --> 05:13:30,398
[SPEAKER_37]: It's left us out.

2924
05:13:30,698 --> 05:13:31,498
[SPEAKER_37]: It's left us behind.

2925
05:13:32,258 --> 05:13:34,519
[SPEAKER_37]: And that's why it really shocks me that when

2926
05:13:35,472 --> 05:13:38,355
[SPEAKER_37]: we finally had a compromise that was put on the table.

2927
05:13:38,635 --> 05:13:41,658
[SPEAKER_37]: And you didn't have to take it, but it was a starting point for conversation.

2928
05:13:42,799 --> 05:13:48,124
[SPEAKER_37]: And that compromise would have prioritized completing proposed commercial districts.

2929
05:13:48,184 --> 05:13:53,028
[SPEAKER_37]: It would have extended the process for residential rezoning.

2930
05:13:53,869 --> 05:13:57,853
[SPEAKER_37]: It would make our public outreach much more robust.

2931
05:13:59,381 --> 05:14:07,267
[SPEAKER_37]: It shocked me that the mayor responded hostilely with ultimatums, with misinformation, and with complaints about not being included in the process.

2932
05:14:08,388 --> 05:14:22,198
[SPEAKER_37]: It shocks me that the mayor would threaten to kill the years of work that Medford has put into bringing our city into the future together, to kill the years of work to bring our city in line with

2933
05:14:22,699 --> 05:14:36,630
[SPEAKER_37]: our comprehensive plan, our climate action and adaptation plan, and our affordable housing plan, the very same plans that a number of politicians in the city, especially the mayor, ran on as candidates in multiple elections and won on.

2934
05:14:37,811 --> 05:14:42,795
[SPEAKER_37]: It shocks me that, it shocks me because these problems are serious, they're real.

2935
05:14:43,495 --> 05:14:44,876
[SPEAKER_37]: And what else are we supposed to do?

2936
05:14:45,117 --> 05:14:45,637
[SPEAKER_37]: Do nothing?

2937
05:14:46,418 --> 05:14:49,200
[SPEAKER_37]: Stick to a status quo system that clearly isn't working?

2938
05:14:50,044 --> 05:14:54,525
[SPEAKER_37]: fully and undermine the people who are trying to fix it, you don't have to agree with them.

2939
05:14:57,546 --> 05:14:59,506
[SPEAKER_37]: The alternative, I think, is pretty clear.

2940
05:14:59,546 --> 05:15:03,767
[SPEAKER_37]: The alternative is dilly-dally, delay, and wither.

2941
05:15:05,008 --> 05:15:14,850
[SPEAKER_37]: And by demanding that we reverse all the progress, or at least substantial progress that we've made as a community, goes a bit too far for good.

2942
05:15:15,723 --> 05:15:23,115
[SPEAKER_37]: When the fact is that as the mayor, the mayor could have stepped up earlier, the mayor could have studied these issues earlier.

2943
05:15:23,767 --> 05:15:29,511
[SPEAKER_37]: She could have dedicated the resources to do the extensive public outreach that she is asking for now.

2944
05:15:30,051 --> 05:15:35,895
[SPEAKER_37]: And in fact, it's the same kind of outreach that we've been asking to get the tools for.

2945
05:15:36,235 --> 05:15:51,365
[SPEAKER_37]: If you look at what the Resident Services Committee has been working on, if you look at the number of resolutions I passed in this council and last council about doing accurate survey research and approaching that correctly, we have a record on this.

2946
05:15:52,828 --> 05:15:56,471
[SPEAKER_37]: And I also want to make it clear, the mayor is welcome at our meetings.

2947
05:15:57,552 --> 05:16:08,420
[SPEAKER_37]: And she's welcome to reach out to her elected officials or the same elected officials who are entrusted by the voters to do the hard work and make the hard choices that we have to make as a community.

2948
05:16:09,601 --> 05:16:11,782
[SPEAKER_37]: The truth is, we will have to come together.

2949
05:16:11,802 --> 05:16:14,965
[SPEAKER_37]: We will have to work together to move our city forward on the key issues.

2950
05:16:15,705 --> 05:16:19,588
[SPEAKER_37]: Affordability, holding developers accountable, and fighting displacement.

2951
05:16:20,169 --> 05:16:21,570
[SPEAKER_37]: And we will have to compromise.

2952
05:16:22,704 --> 05:16:28,530
[SPEAKER_37]: In her press release, the mayor said, this process is hard and complex, but it doesn't have to be combative.

2953
05:16:28,550 --> 05:16:30,772
[SPEAKER_37]: I agree with that.

2954
05:16:31,252 --> 05:16:35,917
[SPEAKER_37]: This moment is tough, but poison pill press releases really don't help.

2955
05:16:37,318 --> 05:16:40,481
[SPEAKER_37]: I hope that we can come together and improve the process together.

2956
05:16:41,041 --> 05:16:41,362
[SPEAKER_37]: I think

2957
05:16:41,988 --> 05:16:48,730
[SPEAKER_37]: The approach that we see proposed in this resolution presents that first compromise that weighs that path forward.

2958
05:16:49,591 --> 05:17:02,695
[SPEAKER_37]: It shines some light and gives us an option to move forward with a path that's better, more inclusive, and a path that will actually, that could get us to reach the goals that we all agree on.

2959
05:17:02,715 --> 05:17:04,756
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

2960
05:17:08,717 --> 05:17:09,537
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

2961
05:17:09,558 --> 05:17:10,758
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go back to Councilor Scarpelli.

2962
05:17:12,112 --> 05:17:18,738
[SPEAKER_29]: Is anybody from the development board, the development team on Zoom?

2963
05:17:19,618 --> 05:17:20,819
[SPEAKER_29]: Everybody must be in bed, right?

2964
05:17:21,760 --> 05:17:25,323
[SPEAKER_64]: Being that it's after midnight, I'm going to let people raise their hand if they want to be recognized.

2965
05:17:26,104 --> 05:17:27,925
[SPEAKER_29]: So my question is simple.

2966
05:17:28,626 --> 05:17:38,114
[SPEAKER_29]: When we look at where we are right now, it's easy to say 20 years, 30 years of, I don't disagree with you.

2967
05:17:41,511 --> 05:17:46,835
[SPEAKER_29]: But it's also easy to say that if we don't do anything, then we're not doing what we're supposed to.

2968
05:17:48,376 --> 05:17:49,417
[SPEAKER_29]: They can both be wrong.

2969
05:17:50,737 --> 05:17:51,758
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's where we are right now.

2970
05:17:51,818 --> 05:17:52,539
[SPEAKER_29]: They're both wrong.

2971
05:17:56,021 --> 05:18:06,488
[SPEAKER_29]: Now, the override was an example that I bring up because, again, no matter how people want to frame how Councilor Scarpelli felt about the override, I never said I was against it.

2972
05:18:06,629 --> 05:18:07,629
[SPEAKER_29]: I never said I was for it.

2973
05:18:07,649 --> 05:18:09,771
[SPEAKER_29]: What I said was, again,

2974
05:18:11,504 --> 05:18:13,605
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's slow the process down and do this right.

2975
05:18:14,465 --> 05:18:16,026
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's get the community involved.

2976
05:18:16,046 --> 05:18:19,267
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's make sure we bring the team involved that can help us make the decision.

2977
05:18:19,947 --> 05:18:21,287
[SPEAKER_29]: And yes, the community spoke.

2978
05:18:22,768 --> 05:18:24,148
[SPEAKER_29]: A very close, close vote.

2979
05:18:25,589 --> 05:18:28,070
[SPEAKER_29]: And then you move forward to the next big issue, which is the charter.

2980
05:18:30,130 --> 05:18:31,031
[SPEAKER_29]: Same situation.

2981
05:18:36,813 --> 05:18:37,913
[SPEAKER_29]: People just aren't listening.

2982
05:18:41,275 --> 05:18:45,356
[SPEAKER_29]: You have this council saying over and over again that the mayor didn't do this.

2983
05:18:45,757 --> 05:18:52,719
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, what team met with the mayor's representative that she speaks with every single day about zoning?

2984
05:18:53,399 --> 05:18:53,779
[SPEAKER_29]: Who is it?

2985
05:18:55,120 --> 05:18:58,681
[SPEAKER_29]: Who do we meet with every single day when we brought issues forward?

2986
05:19:03,363 --> 05:19:07,044
[SPEAKER_29]: The director, Alicia Hunt that we met every single day here.

2987
05:19:07,844 --> 05:19:08,685
[SPEAKER_29]: So somebody's void.

2988
05:19:08,725 --> 05:19:09,545
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a problem here.

2989
05:19:10,640 --> 05:19:21,903
[SPEAKER_29]: So if the director of the department that's supposed to inform the mayor, that's a go between this council, didn't get the information, because that's exactly what we said.

2990
05:19:21,943 --> 05:19:22,983
[SPEAKER_29]: That's exactly what we're saying.

2991
05:19:24,664 --> 05:19:26,924
[SPEAKER_29]: You're saying the mayor didn't do this, the mayor didn't do that.

2992
05:19:27,344 --> 05:19:28,385
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, there's a disconnect.

2993
05:19:29,085 --> 05:19:30,225
[SPEAKER_29]: And the disconnect is this.

2994
05:19:31,025 --> 05:19:34,926
[SPEAKER_29]: Even though you've identified it, there were issues.

2995
05:19:35,746 --> 05:19:37,427
[SPEAKER_29]: There were serious issues about this process.

2996
05:19:39,093 --> 05:19:40,673
[SPEAKER_29]: You've all said it, today you've all said it.

2997
05:19:42,274 --> 05:19:44,275
[SPEAKER_29]: But you still pushed it forward for what end?

2998
05:19:44,795 --> 05:19:45,455
[SPEAKER_29]: To what end?

2999
05:19:46,055 --> 05:19:47,235
[SPEAKER_29]: To say we did something?

3000
05:19:48,296 --> 05:19:49,636
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, this is where we are right now.

3001
05:19:51,637 --> 05:19:54,758
[SPEAKER_29]: We just paid a lot of money to a consultant that really didn't get us anywhere.

3002
05:19:57,038 --> 05:20:01,840
[SPEAKER_29]: No matter what you think, because now the community is really divided because there's no faith here.

3003
05:20:03,780 --> 05:20:06,502
[SPEAKER_29]: And I'm going to go back to the original motion that no one's responded to.

3004
05:20:06,883 --> 05:20:08,845
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't second it again, but let's do it publicly.

3005
05:20:09,765 --> 05:20:13,729
[SPEAKER_29]: I ask for a motion that this council goes back to the Salem Street Corridor.

3006
05:20:14,509 --> 05:20:19,514
[SPEAKER_29]: Show the good faith that this isn't a dog and pony show, this isn't a political show, that this isn't backpedaling.

3007
05:20:20,194 --> 05:20:21,295
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's go revisit again.

3008
05:20:22,456 --> 05:20:27,621
[SPEAKER_29]: Because until we have a meeting and understand that 11 out of 12, I disagree with you.

3009
05:20:29,062 --> 05:20:29,603
[SPEAKER_29]: I disagree.

3010
05:20:30,726 --> 05:20:34,829
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, that's why I was asking for someone from the development board to be here.

3011
05:20:35,109 --> 05:20:40,913
[SPEAKER_29]: Because that evening, that evening, one councilor asked to revert back to the original plan.

3012
05:20:41,614 --> 05:20:41,974
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, yeah.

3013
05:20:43,335 --> 05:20:43,895
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, yeah.

3014
05:20:44,195 --> 05:20:46,817
[SPEAKER_29]: So this is where the laxity, this is the problem.

3015
05:20:47,077 --> 05:20:48,418
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a lack of information.

3016
05:20:48,438 --> 05:20:52,161
[SPEAKER_29]: It's a lack of sharing the knowledge that you think you have and you think everybody else has.

3017
05:20:52,421 --> 05:20:58,085
[SPEAKER_29]: But the bottom line is the community doesn't know what's going on because we're not telling them.

3018
05:20:59,211 --> 05:21:00,812
[SPEAKER_29]: That's why we are where we are right now.

3019
05:21:01,972 --> 05:21:06,215
[SPEAKER_29]: Whether it's the charter, whether it's the override, or now whether it's the zoning.

3020
05:21:11,357 --> 05:21:13,959
[SPEAKER_29]: So we can all be angry, but you know what?

3021
05:21:13,999 --> 05:21:14,999
[SPEAKER_29]: The bottom line is this.

3022
05:21:17,220 --> 05:21:19,081
[SPEAKER_29]: Listen to the constituents, because you know what?

3023
05:21:19,481 --> 05:21:20,742
[SPEAKER_29]: I might not be here next year.

3024
05:21:22,623 --> 05:21:26,285
[SPEAKER_29]: Zach, you might not be here next year, but someone's going to be back.

3025
05:21:28,635 --> 05:21:32,637
[SPEAKER_29]: And all you could do is listen to the people, not to say not to do anything.

3026
05:21:33,698 --> 05:21:39,021
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not saying, there was a comment that was said that, well, we want to say things or do things so we don't get things done.

3027
05:21:39,061 --> 05:21:39,742
[SPEAKER_29]: That's wrong.

3028
05:21:41,783 --> 05:21:48,687
[SPEAKER_29]: As a matter of fact, this council's voted many times with your initiatives to move things along, even though I didn't agree with them.

3029
05:21:50,268 --> 05:21:54,811
[SPEAKER_29]: Not lately, because you could see the relationship we have here.

3030
05:21:54,991 --> 05:21:57,553
[SPEAKER_29]: It's disjointed, dysfunctional.

3031
05:21:59,508 --> 05:22:00,589
[SPEAKER_29]: We're putting things out.

3032
05:22:00,869 --> 05:22:03,891
[SPEAKER_29]: We're making announcements that this council knows nothing about.

3033
05:22:08,674 --> 05:22:17,259
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'll make a motion for the September meeting that we ask the Community Development Board members to come up and explain the Salem Street corridor and what happened there.

3034
05:22:17,619 --> 05:22:21,362
[SPEAKER_29]: Because myself included, the residents of Salem Street,

3035
05:22:22,900 --> 05:22:35,531
[SPEAKER_29]: Everybody's under the assumption that all the changes that the Community Development Board put forth in support of the Salem Street residents were denied and it went back to the original plan of hurting that neighborhood.

3036
05:22:37,252 --> 05:22:39,755
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, maybe you're right.

3037
05:22:41,656 --> 05:22:44,439
[SPEAKER_29]: Or maybe I'm right.

3038
05:22:44,899 --> 05:22:46,120
[SPEAKER_29]: Both sides doesn't win here.

3039
05:22:47,381 --> 05:22:49,263
[SPEAKER_29]: Because you're still not looking at the big picture.

3040
05:22:50,103 --> 05:22:54,804
[SPEAKER_29]: No matter what you think you've done for public meetings and this, that, and the other thing, understand something.

3041
05:22:56,925 --> 05:22:59,566
[SPEAKER_29]: Put a feather in your cap and say, yeah, you had 30 public meetings.

3042
05:22:59,646 --> 05:23:00,466
[SPEAKER_29]: OK, that was good.

3043
05:23:00,786 --> 05:23:02,067
[SPEAKER_29]: And you reached the demographic.

3044
05:23:02,447 --> 05:23:03,787
[SPEAKER_29]: But you didn't reach everybody.

3045
05:23:04,727 --> 05:23:05,568
[SPEAKER_29]: And that's the issue.

3046
05:23:09,189 --> 05:23:11,389
[SPEAKER_29]: And this council voted no on a lot of that stuff.

3047
05:23:11,470 --> 05:23:14,470
[SPEAKER_29]: So this council voted that I brought that forward, Zach.

3048
05:23:14,530 --> 05:23:15,211
[SPEAKER_29]: We brought it forward.

3049
05:23:15,531 --> 05:23:19,332
[SPEAKER_29]: And my relationship with the mayor wasn't very good.

3050
05:23:20,623 --> 05:23:26,705
[SPEAKER_29]: And all of a sudden, everybody's seeing the light now, but the bottom line is this, where she is right now, she's right.

3051
05:23:27,385 --> 05:23:28,626
[SPEAKER_29]: Because the residents have spoken.

3052
05:23:28,646 --> 05:23:34,148
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know what the residents you're talking to, but the residents I'm talking to, a lot of them usually don't talk to George Scarpelli.

3053
05:23:35,068 --> 05:23:38,649
[SPEAKER_29]: But a lot of them are coming up to me and asking me, how do we make these changes?

3054
05:23:38,809 --> 05:23:39,530
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, you know what?

3055
05:23:39,950 --> 05:23:49,513
[SPEAKER_29]: When you see people that are running for office, that are running for office, it kind of wakes you up and says, well, that's a mix of a lot of different people that are going after one common denominator.

3056
05:23:51,012 --> 05:23:54,293
[SPEAKER_29]: They want to run for office because they want to, they're going to listen to people guys.

3057
05:23:54,313 --> 05:23:56,574
[SPEAKER_29]: They're going to listen to everybody.

3058
05:23:57,574 --> 05:23:58,375
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what they're running on.

3059
05:23:59,975 --> 05:24:00,655
[SPEAKER_29]: All 10 people.

3060
05:24:04,717 --> 05:24:05,457
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Councilor.

3061
05:24:05,497 --> 05:24:09,618
[SPEAKER_64]: Before I get to you, president bears, I'm going to just button here quickly.

3062
05:24:09,638 --> 05:24:09,678
[SPEAKER_64]: Um,

3063
05:24:13,554 --> 05:24:34,117
[SPEAKER_64]: Just as a point of privilege, I really resent any councilors singling out any specific member of city staff, especially by name at midnight in a public city council meeting to throw an accusation that that person, excuse me, I'm speaking, excuse me, I'm speaking, I'm speaking.

3064
05:24:36,170 --> 05:24:38,391
[SPEAKER_64]: So in one issue wants to take five hours, it's fine.

3065
05:24:38,411 --> 05:24:41,473
[SPEAKER_64]: But once on something that you don't support, it's not okay for it to take up a lot of the meeting.

3066
05:24:41,873 --> 05:24:43,534
[SPEAKER_64]: Nice, really fair, really democratic.

3067
05:24:49,138 --> 05:24:56,582
[SPEAKER_64]: Do not appreciate any Councilor using their microphone to slander any city staff member.

3068
05:24:57,723 --> 05:24:58,483
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm speaking.

3069
05:25:02,949 --> 05:25:04,850
[SPEAKER_28]: You're accusing her of not doing her job.

3070
05:25:04,870 --> 05:25:07,112
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll take public participation later.

3071
05:25:07,272 --> 05:25:08,173
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sharing.

3072
05:25:08,213 --> 05:25:11,556
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to hear from Councilors and I'm speaking right now.

3073
05:25:34,959 --> 05:25:44,642
[SPEAKER_64]: I think it's a more productive use of this council's time, especially after midnight, if we refrain from giving one another political advice and stick to debating the resolution in front of us.

3074
05:25:45,842 --> 05:26:00,146
[SPEAKER_64]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to have the Community Development Board give a presentation on the ordained Salem Street zoning district, is there a second?

3075
05:26:00,166 --> 05:26:03,307
[SPEAKER_64]: Go ahead.

3076
05:26:06,934 --> 05:26:08,495
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, and this is what I'm talking about, right?

3077
05:26:08,555 --> 05:26:09,895
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know, right?

3078
05:26:12,456 --> 05:26:23,800
[SPEAKER_24]: The idea that the information doesn't exist or it's not being communicated, and that's why everyone's being confused, is that's the falsehood, right, underlying the whole thing, right?

3079
05:26:23,920 --> 05:26:25,200
[SPEAKER_24]: The information does exist.

3080
05:26:25,581 --> 05:26:26,901
[SPEAKER_24]: People are being lied to.

3081
05:26:26,921 --> 05:26:29,242
[SPEAKER_29]: That's not what I'm saying.

3082
05:26:36,353 --> 05:26:37,073
[SPEAKER_24]: Which changes?

3083
05:26:37,093 --> 05:26:38,854
[SPEAKER_29]: Whatever was made.

3084
05:26:38,874 --> 05:26:53,862
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, and I'll read to you what was made right now, because there's facts in the world and they literally exist on paper, regardless of if everyone, you know, if people want to say they ignored all the changes, and that's a political argument, a false statement, a lie, right?

3085
05:26:54,543 --> 05:26:55,063
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll read it to you.

3086
05:26:55,103 --> 05:26:58,485
[SPEAKER_24]: It's in the records that we approved in this body the following meeting that the clerk wrote.

3087
05:27:00,161 --> 05:27:03,544
[SPEAKER_24]: President Bears has declared this portion of the hearing closed at 1049 PM.

3088
05:27:04,024 --> 05:27:13,272
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Leming moved to accept the recommendations of the Community Development Board, except for the recommendation to go to MX1 at the intersection of Salem Street and Park Street.

3089
05:27:13,852 --> 05:27:17,195
[SPEAKER_24]: A yes vote would keep MX2 at the intersection of Park and Salem.

3090
05:27:17,836 --> 05:27:18,816
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Tseng second.

3091
05:27:19,137 --> 05:27:21,999
[SPEAKER_24]: Approved on a roll call vote and six in favor, zero opposed.

3092
05:27:22,580 --> 05:27:25,302
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Leming and Councilor Scarpelli absent, sorry.

3093
05:27:26,823 --> 05:27:31,787
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Leming moved to adopt the remainder of the Community Development Board's recommendations and approve the Zoning Ordinance Amendment.

3094
05:27:31,847 --> 05:27:33,008
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Callahan, second.

3095
05:27:33,168 --> 05:27:37,251
[SPEAKER_24]: Approved on a roll call vote of six in favor, zero opposed, and Councilor Scarpelli, absent.

3096
05:27:38,051 --> 05:27:38,732
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the records.

3097
05:27:39,533 --> 05:27:40,153
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the facts.

3098
05:27:40,794 --> 05:27:41,474
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what happened.

3099
05:27:42,275 --> 05:27:43,636
[SPEAKER_24]: It wasn't that everything was thrown out.

3100
05:27:43,676 --> 05:27:45,577
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not that the Community Development Board wasn't listened to.

3101
05:27:45,677 --> 05:27:55,865
[SPEAKER_24]: It's that God forbid this council, which is the final deciding authority on zoning, decided to adopt all but one of the recommendations.

3102
05:27:59,274 --> 05:28:04,339
[SPEAKER_24]: All but one, 11 out of 12, 95%, however you wanna phrase it, we listen to no one.

3103
05:28:04,839 --> 05:28:05,920
[SPEAKER_24]: They only listen to one group.

3104
05:28:05,940 --> 05:28:06,881
[SPEAKER_24]: They don't listen to everyone.

3105
05:28:06,921 --> 05:28:09,944
[SPEAKER_24]: They don't respect the process.

3106
05:28:09,964 --> 05:28:14,127
[SPEAKER_24]: 10 of the new candidates are gonna listen to everyone, but the seven, the other seven, they're not going to.

3107
05:28:14,147 --> 05:28:19,312
[SPEAKER_24]: I think anyone who's watching this can read exactly what's being said.

3108
05:28:21,314 --> 05:28:22,515
[SPEAKER_24]: If people aren't informed,

3109
05:28:24,111 --> 05:28:33,517
[SPEAKER_24]: or if people are repeating and regurgitating the idea that the CD board's recommendations for Salem Street didn't happen, it's in writing, or we could play the tape.

3110
05:28:33,557 --> 05:28:34,957
[SPEAKER_24]: As you always say, we could do it all.

3111
05:28:37,019 --> 05:28:37,319
[SPEAKER_24]: We did.

3112
05:28:37,899 --> 05:28:39,340
[SPEAKER_24]: We did listen to the community development board.

3113
05:28:40,160 --> 05:28:42,502
[SPEAKER_24]: They had a long list of recommendations.

3114
05:28:43,422 --> 05:28:48,105
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Leming said, I agree with all of them, but one, we should accept all of them, but one.

3115
05:28:49,226 --> 05:28:50,507
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the council voted to do that.

3116
05:28:51,287 --> 05:28:52,928
[SPEAKER_24]: Six in favor, one absent.

3117
05:28:55,993 --> 05:28:57,294
[SPEAKER_24]: No, there's no huge discrepancy.

3118
05:28:57,314 --> 05:28:58,994
[SPEAKER_64]: Excuse me, we're going to go to Councilor Leming next.

3119
05:28:59,134 --> 05:29:00,034
[SPEAKER_64]: We're going to stick to the queue.

3120
05:29:00,194 --> 05:29:01,395
[SPEAKER_24]: But I just want to be clear.

3121
05:29:01,475 --> 05:29:02,715
[SPEAKER_24]: My question was on the substance.

3122
05:29:02,895 --> 05:29:03,775
[SPEAKER_24]: What are we reopening?

3123
05:29:03,795 --> 05:29:06,056
[SPEAKER_24]: Are we reopening that one change?

3124
05:29:06,816 --> 05:29:12,518
[SPEAKER_24]: Or is the reopening because it's assumed that we didn't do any of the recommendations, right?

3125
05:29:12,538 --> 05:29:14,338
[SPEAKER_24]: And the mayor now putting that forward?

3126
05:29:14,618 --> 05:29:15,959
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the part I'm confused by.

3127
05:29:15,979 --> 05:29:19,420
[SPEAKER_24]: We accepted all but one of the changes.

3128
05:29:21,040 --> 05:29:24,421
[SPEAKER_24]: A false statement has been spread that none of the changes were accepted.

3129
05:29:25,073 --> 05:29:28,015
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't see a reason to reopen something that we actually already did.

3130
05:29:28,915 --> 05:29:30,316
[SPEAKER_24]: We listened to the Community Development Board.

3131
05:29:31,177 --> 05:29:32,898
[SPEAKER_24]: We agreed with everything they said except one thing.

3132
05:29:38,221 --> 05:29:40,343
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go to Councilor Leming and then back to Councilor Scarpelli.

3133
05:29:44,925 --> 05:29:47,487
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want to drag this on for too much longer.

3134
05:29:47,547 --> 05:29:48,147
[SPEAKER_25]: It's late.

3135
05:29:50,002 --> 05:30:00,068
[SPEAKER_25]: Another thing I'd like to point out with the Community Development Board is that, yes, a lot of them do have expertise, but they're not explicitly experts.

3136
05:30:00,108 --> 05:30:14,517
[SPEAKER_25]: To be clear, the Community Development Board in Medford, our version of the planning board, which is usually how it's referenced in Mass General Law, they're a group of people, could be just common residents appointed solely by the mayor, don't even get

3137
05:30:15,684 --> 05:30:25,491
[SPEAKER_25]: we don't, this council doesn't get to approve members of the Community Development Board because of a specific state law passed years ago.

3138
05:30:25,551 --> 05:30:41,702
[SPEAKER_25]: In most other municipalities, the Planning Board does have council approval, but the Community Development Board is not a group, is not necessarily a group of experts who have like a lot more, who have like a whole lot more knowledge in

3139
05:30:42,582 --> 05:30:44,404
[SPEAKER_25]: zoning than we do.

3140
05:30:44,424 --> 05:30:51,269
[SPEAKER_25]: The group of experts are the staff and the consultants that we specifically hire for their expertise.

3141
05:30:51,349 --> 05:30:55,713
[SPEAKER_25]: The Community Development Board is another group of appointed citizens.

3142
05:30:55,773 --> 05:31:02,578
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to be clear that when the Community Development Board says something, it's not an edict from a higher power.

3143
05:31:02,598 --> 05:31:06,301
[SPEAKER_25]: It's another group of residents appointed by the mayor.

3144
05:31:06,582 --> 05:31:07,603
[SPEAKER_25]: Just really want to

3145
05:31:08,623 --> 05:31:09,904
[SPEAKER_25]: really want to clarify that there.

3146
05:31:09,964 --> 05:31:19,370
[SPEAKER_25]: And the only other requirement under MGL is that they hold public hearings on any proposed changes to zoning, much like Council does.

3147
05:31:19,770 --> 05:31:20,131
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

3148
05:31:21,692 --> 05:31:22,412
[SPEAKER_64]: Councilor Scarlatti.

3149
05:31:24,313 --> 05:31:28,516
[SPEAKER_29]: For the communication, if you can, because this is what I'm saying.

3150
05:31:29,697 --> 05:31:34,640
[SPEAKER_29]: We need to know that the communication that's going out there, that it's presented correctly.

3151
05:31:35,290 --> 05:31:35,450
[SPEAKER_29]: right?

3152
05:31:35,650 --> 05:31:49,479
[SPEAKER_29]: So if we can ask the Community Development Board to restructure what those changes were, so those statements are false, so we can move forward.

3153
05:31:49,499 --> 05:31:49,859
[SPEAKER_29]: That's all.

3154
05:31:53,101 --> 05:31:53,642
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

3155
05:31:56,543 --> 05:32:01,867
[SPEAKER_24]: If the motion is that we request that the Office of Community Development state what was changed

3156
05:32:02,840 --> 05:32:19,088
[SPEAKER_24]: And what what recommendations of the community level board were adopted for Santa Street and which were not and put that out, I would second that it's in our records, but if they want to say it again, I mean that's fine but but my point being that this is, this is what's at issue here, like, I agree.

3157
05:32:23,000 --> 05:32:31,915
[SPEAKER_24]: This started to go off of the rails when communications started to go out that contained inaccurate information, particularly communications that came from the administration.

3158
05:32:32,396 --> 05:32:34,199
[SPEAKER_24]: Communications that didn't get reviewed by

3159
05:32:34,970 --> 05:32:42,034
[SPEAKER_24]: the council team leading the project, co-leading the project with the mayor's planning staff or with the zoning consultants.

3160
05:32:42,755 --> 05:32:44,836
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's because those decisions were political decisions.

3161
05:32:44,896 --> 05:32:46,897
[SPEAKER_24]: They were not decisions made in service of the project.

3162
05:32:46,917 --> 05:32:55,403
[SPEAKER_24]: They were decisions made in service of whatever fears or inaccurate information was driving the decision-making process.

3163
05:32:55,483 --> 05:32:56,583
[SPEAKER_24]: And like, this is the thing, right?

3164
05:32:56,604 --> 05:33:00,686
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, I think it's the reason that Kit got frustrated, Councilor Collins got frustrated, right?

3165
05:33:02,087 --> 05:33:03,528
[SPEAKER_24]: Up until May,

3166
05:33:04,950 --> 05:33:11,432
[SPEAKER_24]: we were not really aware that the mayor had issues with how the project was going, right?

3167
05:33:11,552 --> 05:33:16,714
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm not gonna go inside the administration and say, who's doing a good job or not doing a good job.

3168
05:33:17,635 --> 05:33:26,838
[SPEAKER_24]: We were operating under the assumption that we were doing co-leading a project with the Planning Development Sustainability Office, which is part of the mayor's administration.

3169
05:33:28,306 --> 05:33:35,969
[SPEAKER_24]: I still to this day have not heard the mayor articulate a different vision for zoning than what has been put out or what is in the comprehensive plan.

3170
05:33:36,689 --> 05:33:42,551
[SPEAKER_24]: I still to this date haven't heard the mayor really take accountability and responsibility for the role in the process.

3171
05:33:42,671 --> 05:33:48,834
[SPEAKER_24]: It basically sounded to me like, and we heard it in what she said, she's like, my biggest weakness is I trust too much.

3172
05:33:49,274 --> 05:33:52,115
[SPEAKER_24]: That's basically the fundamental thing that's in the letter, right?

3173
05:33:52,175 --> 05:33:55,156
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's like, I trusted you guys to do the project,

3174
05:33:56,243 --> 05:34:00,968
[SPEAKER_24]: And so I wasn't really involved and then once I saw the results I got frustrated.

3175
05:34:01,749 --> 05:34:14,922
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know, that's just not when kids saying for months we need more communications when kids literally writing the city website, which is the job of the communications team, like, and when that's what I'm saying like

3176
05:34:15,688 --> 05:34:20,650
[SPEAKER_24]: It was coming up in meetings very regularly that we wanna do more and we wanna be more engaged.

3177
05:34:20,710 --> 05:34:26,972
[SPEAKER_24]: And the person who holds the purse strings and the only person who can do an appropriation is the only person that can sign contracts.

3178
05:34:28,772 --> 05:34:29,973
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not getting the response from them.

3179
05:34:30,553 --> 05:34:32,874
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the strong mayor plan A system that we live in.

3180
05:34:33,634 --> 05:34:37,815
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just think it's a day late and a dollar short to be like, well, I trusted everybody and they let me down.

3181
05:34:41,616 --> 05:34:43,057
[SPEAKER_24]: We're doing our best with what you give us.

3182
05:34:44,709 --> 05:34:45,870
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's all I'm saying.

3183
05:34:46,010 --> 05:35:00,122
[SPEAKER_24]: If it's about getting the accurate information out, that's been my biggest issue for the last three months is that I think less than accurate to boldly and blatantly inaccurate information has gone out that has scared residents, that doesn't accurately reflect what the zoning proposals entail.

3184
05:35:00,823 --> 05:35:12,373
[SPEAKER_24]: So if we want to start with Salem Street and ask the Office of Community Development or Planning Development and Sustainability to issue a press release that says what was adopted and what wasn't from the Community Development Board, I'm in.

3185
05:35:13,693 --> 05:35:17,016
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'd be happy to include that as a B paper or an amendment, whatever.

3186
05:35:18,377 --> 05:35:18,637
[SPEAKER_64]: Great.

3187
05:35:19,077 --> 05:35:20,859
[SPEAKER_64]: Why don't we take all votes at the end of this?

3188
05:35:21,720 --> 05:35:22,620
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to be a B paper.

3189
05:35:23,301 --> 05:35:23,661
[SPEAKER_64]: B paper?

3190
05:35:23,761 --> 05:35:23,942
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

3191
05:35:24,122 --> 05:35:24,322
[SPEAKER_64]: Great.

3192
05:35:24,742 --> 05:35:24,942
[SPEAKER_64]: Great.

3193
05:35:24,982 --> 05:35:26,023
[SPEAKER_64]: There's a second on the B paper.

3194
05:35:26,043 --> 05:35:28,385
[SPEAKER_64]: Second.

3195
05:35:30,607 --> 05:35:42,016
[SPEAKER_64]: I think part of what is so frustrating to me about this, speaking from the chair, I think part of what is so frustrating to me about the tenor of this conversation specifically

3196
05:35:43,495 --> 05:35:52,087
[SPEAKER_64]: is that I think for 18 months, this council has internally agreed on what we need to make this process better.

3197
05:35:52,728 --> 05:35:59,598
[SPEAKER_64]: Even if we have disagreed on specific zoning proposals, I think we've all been saying in various ways, every single one of us,

3198
05:36:01,298 --> 05:36:08,122
[SPEAKER_64]: We could use more resources to really do this right and really do this in the way that community members are asking for.

3199
05:36:08,963 --> 05:36:11,705
[SPEAKER_64]: Some of us voiced specific strategies and tactics.

3200
05:36:11,805 --> 05:36:14,487
[SPEAKER_64]: Others were more focused on other specific strategies and tactics.

3201
05:36:14,547 --> 05:36:22,071
[SPEAKER_64]: Sometimes we disagreed on what we thought would be the best fit for giving the community the

3202
05:36:25,202 --> 05:36:40,125
[SPEAKER_64]: robust, I think we've all held the goal of making this process uniquely and unprecedentedly accessible beyond the minimum, which we've always done, of what is required of us by state law.

3203
05:36:41,117 --> 05:36:46,900
[SPEAKER_64]: And I just think I want to be clear, I think we really need to be clear about what we're debating here in this conversation.

3204
05:36:47,500 --> 05:37:04,709
[SPEAKER_64]: We are debating whether to ask the mayor, who is the only person who has the power to appropriate the resources to make this process into an even more communicative, deliberate, inclusive process that I think we have all been asking for, to make that possible, because she is the only one who can, or

3205
05:37:08,095 --> 05:37:25,925
[SPEAKER_64]: if we are really okay with the mayor asking the city council to make a choice between doing this very consequential process on a shoestring versus throwing out five years of work and financial investments and doing it not at all, because that is the choice that's before us.

3206
05:37:31,289 --> 05:37:36,752
[SPEAKER_64]: And I think I share, I think a little bit of regret that probably President Bears also does that we were not

3207
05:37:37,735 --> 05:37:51,881
[SPEAKER_64]: more communicative about the difficulties that we have been experiencing since January of 2024 about doing this ambitious, very good, very ambitious process under this scope.

3208
05:37:55,942 --> 05:37:56,963
[SPEAKER_64]: I think that we have done

3209
05:37:58,981 --> 05:38:04,146
[SPEAKER_64]: a really good job compared to the resources that we've been given to try to make this extremely accessible.

3210
05:38:04,727 --> 05:38:07,209
[SPEAKER_64]: I think our consultant has been incredibly flexible.

3211
05:38:07,229 --> 05:38:14,036
[SPEAKER_64]: I think our city staff has been wonderful, helpful, skeptical in all the ways that they have been.

3212
05:38:14,056 --> 05:38:17,059
[SPEAKER_64]: I think that Councilors have really stepped up.

3213
05:38:18,401 --> 05:38:24,625
[SPEAKER_64]: to try to use their individual platforms, all of us, to get information out into the community to try to make this accessible.

3214
05:38:25,565 --> 05:38:32,730
[SPEAKER_64]: I know for myself, for a good part of this year, I was serving as essentially a pro bono communications officer for the planning department, which nobody wants.

3215
05:38:36,032 --> 05:38:37,052
[SPEAKER_64]: That's not best practice.

3216
05:38:38,333 --> 05:38:47,619
[SPEAKER_64]: That wasn't anybody's plan A. That's what happens when you try to shoehorn making manifest the mayor's comprehensive plan

3217
05:38:48,448 --> 05:38:49,848
[SPEAKER_64]: into a two-year process.

3218
05:38:56,150 --> 05:39:17,337
[SPEAKER_64]: And I wanna be really clear that I am never going to be okay with the mayor holding the resolution of that comprehensive planning process hostage over this political situation, which is how I read that public letter.

3219
05:39:18,927 --> 05:39:46,216
[SPEAKER_64]: And I am never going to respect the mayor positioning the $200,000 that President Bears is asking for in this resolution as though it's some wasteful and exorbitant expenditure when to fail to give this process the resources that it needs to be done successfully isn't just declining to spend more money, it is wasting the five years of work that have gotten us to this point

3220
05:39:48,098 --> 05:39:52,600
[SPEAKER_64]: and the many thousands of dollars that we have already invested in this very important and very worthwhile process.

3221
05:39:54,721 --> 05:39:56,721
[SPEAKER_64]: So the reframe there, I think is really important.

3222
05:39:58,062 --> 05:40:01,303
[SPEAKER_64]: And I think that we are all aligned on what we know needs to happen in the city.

3223
05:40:01,343 --> 05:40:04,024
[SPEAKER_64]: We know it needs to be easier to find and keep a home here.

3224
05:40:04,524 --> 05:40:06,505
[SPEAKER_64]: It needs to be easier to open a business here.

3225
05:40:07,165 --> 05:40:11,207
[SPEAKER_64]: It needs to be more lively and fun in our commercial districts and our squares.

3226
05:40:11,227 --> 05:40:13,908
[SPEAKER_64]: I think we all agree on that.

3227
05:40:16,998 --> 05:40:27,804
[SPEAKER_64]: and it would be a huge waste if the mayor takes the good work that so many people, city staff, Councilors, community members have been collaborating on for years.

3228
05:40:29,205 --> 05:40:39,391
[SPEAKER_64]: And instead of saying time to pivot, what do we need right now so that we can see this through in the right way, decides to catastrophize and politicize and spread misinformation about what's really going on here.

3229
05:40:39,671 --> 05:40:42,333
[SPEAKER_64]: Because what we are trying to do is manifest her comprehensive plan.

3230
05:40:43,475 --> 05:40:44,976
[SPEAKER_64]: And I still think that's really worthwhile.

3231
05:40:44,996 --> 05:40:48,698
[SPEAKER_64]: And I think everybody knows how passionate about it I am.

3232
05:40:49,779 --> 05:40:52,600
[SPEAKER_64]: And I'm willing to compromise on the timeline if it means that we do it right.

3233
05:40:52,880 --> 05:40:54,281
[SPEAKER_64]: And that is all we are asking for.

3234
05:40:54,301 --> 05:41:11,811
[SPEAKER_64]: So especially after her 20 years on the body that actually has the purview over zoning, I would hope she'd be willing to be a little more flexible than that public letter made her out to be to appropriate the resources that would make this be the project that the community of Medford really deserves.

3235
05:41:18,038 --> 05:41:19,279
[SPEAKER_64]: I see planner Evans on zoom.

3236
05:41:19,299 --> 05:41:22,180
[SPEAKER_64]: Are there any other city Councilors who would like to weigh in before we take votes?

3237
05:41:25,462 --> 05:41:26,062
[SPEAKER_64]: Danielle, go ahead.

3238
05:41:34,287 --> 05:41:35,648
[SPEAKER_64]: Unmuted you, but we can't hear you.

3239
05:41:37,529 --> 05:41:38,269
[SPEAKER_45]: Hi, can you hear me?

3240
05:41:38,289 --> 05:41:39,510
[SPEAKER_45]: Go for it.

3241
05:41:39,930 --> 05:41:43,372
[SPEAKER_45]: I can't have my it won't let me turn my camera on, but I'm here.

3242
05:41:44,107 --> 05:41:49,511
[SPEAKER_45]: I've been listening, and if anyone has any questions for me, I'm happy to answer them.

3243
05:41:49,531 --> 05:42:07,483
[SPEAKER_45]: I think I'm going to try to use I statements because I'm not speaking for the mayor's office, and I'm not speaking for Director Hunt, who is on a much deserved vacation, and I'm glad that she is not up at 1235 watching this meeting.

3244
05:42:09,404 --> 05:42:10,465
[SPEAKER_45]: So I'm trying to handle that.

3245
05:42:12,224 --> 05:42:28,415
[SPEAKER_45]: I think we all know that the zoning needs to be updated and that the resources, the funding that was made available at the beginning was insufficient for what this project kind of grew into.

3246
05:42:31,497 --> 05:42:37,922
[SPEAKER_45]: So as city staff, we kind of have to backfill and we're working as a team with the consultants

3247
05:42:43,973 --> 05:42:48,715
[SPEAKER_45]: But basically, I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time articulating myself at this point.

3248
05:42:50,916 --> 05:43:07,983
[SPEAKER_45]: But our officer, I have been saying that we need to slow it down a bit because we can't give it the time and attention and the scrutiny that it needs so that we can make sure that there aren't unintended consequences in some of the zoning.

3249
05:43:09,504 --> 05:43:11,185
[SPEAKER_45]: It's moving very fast.

3250
05:43:12,738 --> 05:43:15,380
[SPEAKER_45]: worked in city planning for over 20 years.

3251
05:43:15,400 --> 05:43:17,903
[SPEAKER_45]: I've sat on a zoning board before.

3252
05:43:17,923 --> 05:43:20,685
[SPEAKER_45]: I've written zoning as a planner.

3253
05:43:21,786 --> 05:43:30,493
[SPEAKER_45]: So I actually have a lot of experience, probably the most experience, not to, you know, toot my own horn or anything, but it is very fast.

3254
05:43:37,019 --> 05:43:39,561
[SPEAKER_45]: I don't think there's a pro and against side.

3255
05:43:39,581 --> 05:43:40,282
[SPEAKER_45]: I think there's a lot of

3256
05:43:40,781 --> 05:43:46,384
[SPEAKER_45]: very rational people in the middle, and we just need to take the time.

3257
05:43:46,404 --> 05:43:58,832
[SPEAKER_45]: So I'm hoping that we can get the consultants back on board because our office does not have the staff capacity to do this in-house.

3258
05:43:59,312 --> 05:44:08,997
[SPEAKER_45]: If we had a handful of other planners, it'd still be pretty tricky to do since I also have to do all the site plan review, and that's going to start coming.

3259
05:44:10,377 --> 05:44:14,239
[SPEAKER_45]: very quickly, we unfortunately burned out a lot of the CD board members.

3260
05:44:14,919 --> 05:44:24,544
[SPEAKER_45]: And also, I don't think it would be appropriate for the volunteer community development board members to come and give a presentation at a city council meeting.

3261
05:44:27,245 --> 05:44:33,228
[SPEAKER_45]: We have professional planning staff that act as agents for the board and can kind of explain those things.

3262
05:44:34,489 --> 05:44:37,150
[SPEAKER_45]: They are volunteers, they're not paid.

3263
05:44:38,513 --> 05:44:41,356
[SPEAKER_45]: Pittance of a stipend like $900 for the whole year.

3264
05:44:42,357 --> 05:44:43,518
[SPEAKER_45]: They have full time jobs.

3265
05:44:46,280 --> 05:44:56,109
[SPEAKER_45]: So if I. I'm happy to answer any questions and explain any of the process.

3266
05:44:57,830 --> 05:44:59,492
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm more of an incrementalist.

3267
05:45:00,032 --> 05:45:01,914
[SPEAKER_45]: I also the idea of.

3268
05:45:04,667 --> 05:45:08,549
[SPEAKER_45]: passing zoning and then going back and making changes is not a bad thing.

3269
05:45:08,769 --> 05:45:10,870
[SPEAKER_45]: Zoning is always iterative.

3270
05:45:11,490 --> 05:45:30,159
[SPEAKER_45]: You pass something and then once you start working with it, because right now where we're actually reviewing proposals for the sales recorder and there's things in there that are kind of quirky and don't make any sense because you don't realize what the zoning really says until you start applying it to real world cases.

3271
05:45:30,920 --> 05:45:31,100
[SPEAKER_45]: So

3272
05:45:32,179 --> 05:45:34,339
[SPEAKER_45]: Changing things is not bad.

3273
05:45:34,399 --> 05:45:35,580
[SPEAKER_45]: It's not a failure.

3274
05:45:37,160 --> 05:45:45,401
[SPEAKER_45]: It's learning and being able to change as we get more information or circumstances change.

3275
05:45:46,141 --> 05:45:51,962
[SPEAKER_45]: I think that the culture of the city has been that zoning is so permanent that you never change it.

3276
05:45:54,243 --> 05:45:57,623
[SPEAKER_45]: We're so fortunate to be a city that we can change it as often as we want.

3277
05:45:59,004 --> 05:46:01,564
[SPEAKER_45]: We're not a town where you can only do it at town meetings.

3278
05:46:02,102 --> 05:46:05,886
[SPEAKER_45]: It's, we can fix things when we find mistakes.

3279
05:46:08,709 --> 05:46:11,632
[SPEAKER_45]: Basically, that's, that's all I have to say right now.

3280
05:46:11,812 --> 05:46:13,714
[SPEAKER_45]: And thank you.

3281
05:46:19,372 --> 05:46:19,892
[SPEAKER_64]: Thanks, Daniel.

3282
05:46:21,174 --> 05:46:24,236
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go back to Councilor Scarpelli, then we'll take public comment.

3283
05:46:25,658 --> 05:46:28,320
[SPEAKER_29]: First, Daniel, thank you for being up this late.

3284
05:46:28,480 --> 05:46:41,151
[SPEAKER_29]: And again, in this hour, I made any comment to call out or blame the director.

3285
05:46:41,191 --> 05:46:42,152
[SPEAKER_29]: That's not my intent.

3286
05:46:42,192 --> 05:46:45,495
[SPEAKER_29]: My intent was to ask these questions where only

3287
05:46:47,242 --> 05:46:48,742
[SPEAKER_29]: people that were directly involved.

3288
05:46:52,784 --> 05:46:54,804
[SPEAKER_29]: Was this going fast, in your opinion?

3289
05:46:54,824 --> 05:46:59,205
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, everybody's saying it, but was this going too fast, in your opinion?

3290
05:47:08,068 --> 05:47:09,348
[SPEAKER_64]: You're welcome to respond if you wish to.

3291
05:47:09,428 --> 05:47:11,669
[SPEAKER_45]: Ru, the chair.

3292
05:47:17,580 --> 05:47:19,420
[SPEAKER_45]: In complete honesty, yes.

3293
05:47:21,141 --> 05:47:33,923
[SPEAKER_45]: From my perspective, the pace was too fast for our limited capacity to be able to keep up with it.

3294
05:47:33,983 --> 05:47:43,645
[SPEAKER_45]: I think that if the changes were maybe less controversial,

3295
05:47:46,234 --> 05:47:51,275
[SPEAKER_45]: and were able to make it through the public hearing processes at the original timeline.

3296
05:47:51,295 --> 05:47:57,557
[SPEAKER_45]: It would still be ambitious, but it wouldn't have been so overwhelming.

3297
05:47:57,597 --> 05:48:02,338
[SPEAKER_45]: I think the problem is that they started backing up.

3298
05:48:02,358 --> 05:48:09,500
[SPEAKER_45]: So they started getting stacked on each other, that it was really hard to keep up with what was going on because

3299
05:48:12,100 --> 05:48:23,650
[SPEAKER_45]: If I, if I can, especially with the residential zoning, I had kind of advocated that that be put at the end that we focused on the squares in the quarters, our density, the biggest opportunities for change.

3300
05:48:24,290 --> 05:48:31,776
[SPEAKER_45]: And then once we find out what those anchors are, then we would fill in around it with the residential zoning.

3301
05:48:33,130 --> 05:48:41,756
[SPEAKER_45]: which will be informed by the denser areas where you kind of feather out to lower density where there isn't the transit or the infrastructure for it.

3302
05:48:44,138 --> 05:48:49,402
[SPEAKER_29]: And if I could stop you there, Danielle, I want to apologize because you know what, I shouldn't even ask you any questions.

3303
05:48:49,422 --> 05:48:54,726
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that we made a motion that maybe we should all sit together and when we're all lucid, I think that

3304
05:48:56,133 --> 05:48:59,055
[SPEAKER_29]: We have had a long, it's almost one o'clock in the morning, so I apologize.

3305
05:48:59,075 --> 05:49:03,079
[SPEAKER_29]: I shouldn't have even asked you any questions and I'm gonna leave it at that.

3306
05:49:03,479 --> 05:49:23,735
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd like to, I know we made a motion to maybe meet with the team again and try to understand so we can get a path to move forward so that there isn't contention with the mayor's office and we do find a way to keep this going, but also looking at the issues and concerns that we brought up and the confusion that is out there

3307
05:49:24,453 --> 05:49:25,774
[SPEAKER_29]: that's causing the yanks.

3308
05:49:25,834 --> 05:49:30,156
[SPEAKER_29]: So again, I'm going to reframe for any more questions and thank you for being up this late.

3309
05:49:30,196 --> 05:49:30,817
[SPEAKER_29]: I apologize.

3310
05:49:32,598 --> 05:49:33,418
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Councilor.

3311
05:49:33,839 --> 05:49:35,019
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go back to President Bears.

3312
05:49:36,660 --> 05:49:37,040
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

3313
05:49:37,160 --> 05:49:38,041
[SPEAKER_24]: And yeah, thank you, Danielle.

3314
05:49:38,081 --> 05:49:38,641
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate it.

3315
05:49:38,661 --> 05:49:40,943
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think like what you said, elucidates the point, right?

3316
05:49:41,443 --> 05:49:47,927
[SPEAKER_24]: Like we started the project with the resources we had to try to implement the full comprehensive plan.

3317
05:49:48,707 --> 05:49:52,649
[SPEAKER_24]: And, you know, we were like, here are the nine amendments and we're going to do these and

3318
05:49:54,231 --> 05:50:03,138
[SPEAKER_24]: knowing what we know now, we didn't expect some of these proposals to end up at two, three, four, five more public hearings than we had outlined in the timeline.

3319
05:50:03,559 --> 05:50:05,360
[SPEAKER_24]: Then they start to back up against each other.

3320
05:50:06,321 --> 05:50:14,888
[SPEAKER_24]: We started residential when we did, and maybe Danielle was right now looking at back in hindsight, but the flip side of that discussion internally was residential is going to be really big.

3321
05:50:14,928 --> 05:50:16,790
[SPEAKER_24]: We should start it early so we have more time.

3322
05:50:16,930 --> 05:50:20,573
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think we're now really getting into the nitty gritty of understanding how we got to where we're getting.

3323
05:50:21,322 --> 05:50:38,767
[SPEAKER_24]: And like I appreciate Danielle like I think the team, the team that's been working on this to bring things and try to get the scheduling of the planning and permitting committee and the Community Development Board and the council and all the public hearings across the nine proposed amendment categories, like we had honest disagreements internally.

3324
05:50:38,787 --> 05:50:42,528
[SPEAKER_24]: And, and, but honestly,

3325
05:50:43,408 --> 05:50:46,051
[SPEAKER_24]: We had some honest disagreements internally, we had a lot more general agreement.

3326
05:50:46,072 --> 05:50:54,883
[SPEAKER_24]: And we started to realize, especially we did the framework right, then we did Mystic and Greenscore, and then we did Salem.

3327
05:50:57,270 --> 05:51:16,256
[SPEAKER_24]: You can hear from what Danielle said and what I'm talking about, what Kit's been talking about in the mayor's letter, when it started to become clear that if the process was gonna go this direction, and then we can talk about the million different reasons why the process went that direction, and that's a more complicated conversation, how it got stretched out.

3328
05:51:18,256 --> 05:51:23,598
[SPEAKER_24]: We are where we are now, which is that we see how we got here, and more time makes sense because

3329
05:51:25,781 --> 05:51:29,164
[SPEAKER_24]: there were assumptions made at the beginning of the process that proved themselves to be untrue.

3330
05:51:30,605 --> 05:51:35,049
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's very different from, again, and I don't say this to bring up the point again, right?

3331
05:51:35,089 --> 05:51:37,991
[SPEAKER_24]: But like we acted in good faith to do a good thing.

3332
05:51:39,172 --> 05:51:41,775
[SPEAKER_24]: We found out that some of the assumptions we made weren't accurate.

3333
05:51:41,815 --> 05:51:43,116
[SPEAKER_24]: We tried to correct for them.

3334
05:51:43,896 --> 05:51:51,643
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the corrections weren't enough and we're correcting them for them more specifically because of the community development board's feedback that the public hearings are too much for them.

3335
05:51:52,637 --> 05:51:54,357
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the main thing driving the change.

3336
05:51:54,377 --> 05:51:56,018
[SPEAKER_24]: I think that's the main thing driving the change here.

3337
05:51:56,598 --> 05:52:01,799
[SPEAKER_24]: And then the mayor's role in that, she can choose to define it however she wants, but I've said my piece on that.

3338
05:52:01,819 --> 05:52:10,561
[SPEAKER_24]: That's just very different from the idea that we started it from the beginning, trying not to involve people because we wanted an outcome.

3339
05:52:11,761 --> 05:52:12,422
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all I'm saying.

3340
05:52:16,923 --> 05:52:18,103
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go to Councilor Lazzaro.

3341
05:52:19,508 --> 05:52:20,408
[SPEAKER_60]: I call the question.

3342
05:52:20,448 --> 05:52:20,989
[SPEAKER_60]: I love you all.

3343
05:52:21,049 --> 05:52:21,629
[SPEAKER_60]: It's too late.

3344
05:52:21,669 --> 05:52:23,770
[SPEAKER_60]: We need to do public participation and get out of here.

3345
05:52:23,950 --> 05:52:24,450
[SPEAKER_60]: I can't do this.

3346
05:52:27,011 --> 05:52:27,352
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

3347
05:52:27,612 --> 05:52:29,132
[SPEAKER_64]: We will start at the podium.

3348
05:52:30,933 --> 05:52:32,174
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

3349
05:52:32,214 --> 05:52:33,054
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

3350
05:52:37,196 --> 05:52:37,976
[SPEAKER_64]: Oh, sorry.

3351
05:52:38,657 --> 05:52:38,957
[SPEAKER_69]: Sorry.

3352
05:52:39,197 --> 05:52:39,457
[SPEAKER_69]: Sorry.

3353
05:52:41,993 --> 05:52:42,493
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

3354
05:52:44,435 --> 05:52:47,618
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you ma'am.

3355
05:52:47,838 --> 05:52:50,500
[SPEAKER_20]: I hope we can agree on a few things that I'm just going to describe.

3356
05:52:50,520 --> 05:52:56,545
[SPEAKER_20]: So the first one is like, so we're dealing with zoning today at like 1246am.

3357
05:52:57,066 --> 05:53:00,709
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a CDB meeting tomorrow on residential zoning.

3358
05:53:00,809 --> 05:53:03,050
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a PPC

3359
05:53:04,031 --> 05:53:04,852
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to cancel it.

3360
05:53:05,292 --> 05:53:05,993
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to cancel it.

3361
05:53:06,093 --> 05:53:07,554
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, but that was on there.

3362
05:53:07,654 --> 05:53:09,235
[SPEAKER_20]: So we cannot keep up.

3363
05:53:09,456 --> 05:53:14,720
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, no reasonable person that wants to invest their time on this can keep up.

3364
05:53:15,180 --> 05:53:17,002
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think this needs to be fixed.

3365
05:53:17,162 --> 05:53:18,763
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it just can't keep happening.

3366
05:53:19,404 --> 05:53:21,365
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think we would all agree, it's not good for anyone.

3367
05:53:21,425 --> 05:53:22,666
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not good for Daniel.

3368
05:53:22,686 --> 05:53:23,247
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not good for us.

3369
05:53:23,267 --> 05:53:23,807
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not good for you.

3370
05:53:23,827 --> 05:53:25,348
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not good for absolutely anyone.

3371
05:53:25,889 --> 05:53:27,170
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's part of the communication.

3372
05:53:28,189 --> 05:53:40,401
[SPEAKER_20]: So, that one one point two is that I think there was also a failure and sort of adapting quickly enough, as you saw that Daniel.

3373
05:53:41,482 --> 05:53:45,926
[SPEAKER_20]: When she started mentioning like we're getting over when we're going to run, I didn't see the city council really.

3374
05:53:47,030 --> 05:53:48,111
[SPEAKER_20]: listening to that too much.

3375
05:53:48,491 --> 05:53:54,235
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, we had a, there was an agenda today to put the corridors into the CDB.

3376
05:53:54,275 --> 05:53:55,797
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know whether that was procedural or not.

3377
05:53:55,857 --> 05:53:56,877
[SPEAKER_20]: It had to be there anyways.

3378
05:53:56,897 --> 05:53:57,578
[SPEAKER_20]: It was tabled.

3379
05:53:57,978 --> 05:54:01,201
[SPEAKER_20]: But that needs to be addressed as well.

3380
05:54:02,161 --> 05:54:04,623
[SPEAKER_20]: So and then the other thing is like, where are we going with this?

3381
05:54:05,023 --> 05:54:06,605
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I honestly, you know,

3382
05:54:07,832 --> 05:54:09,634
[SPEAKER_20]: Each of you has an incentive to get reelected.

3383
05:54:09,814 --> 05:54:14,938
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's going to have an influence in your decision, except for Chair Collins.

3384
05:54:16,119 --> 05:54:19,082
[SPEAKER_20]: So what we need to inform the public, where is this going?

3385
05:54:19,362 --> 05:54:20,964
[SPEAKER_20]: What are we trying to achieve if we delay this?

3386
05:54:21,564 --> 05:54:22,205
[SPEAKER_20]: What's going on?

3387
05:54:22,525 --> 05:54:23,346
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

3388
05:54:23,526 --> 05:54:25,828
[SPEAKER_20]: And I've been super involved in residential zoning.

3389
05:54:25,968 --> 05:54:27,910
[SPEAKER_20]: I have no idea where we're going from here.

3390
05:54:28,935 --> 05:54:31,636
[SPEAKER_20]: And this shouldn't be discussed at 1247A.

3391
05:54:31,836 --> 05:54:32,417
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much.

3392
05:54:32,497 --> 05:54:32,717
[SPEAKER_20]: Great.

3393
05:54:33,217 --> 05:54:33,897
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you, Gaston.

3394
05:54:33,977 --> 05:54:36,439
[SPEAKER_64]: And I'll just reiterate maybe more clearly than I did the first time.

3395
05:54:36,459 --> 05:54:42,702
[SPEAKER_64]: I think all of the concerns that you put really well just now are exactly what we're trying to fix.

3396
05:54:45,723 --> 05:54:47,604
[SPEAKER_64]: We will go to Zoom next.

3397
05:54:47,784 --> 05:54:49,585
[SPEAKER_64]: Cheryl, name and address for the record, please.

3398
05:54:49,605 --> 05:54:50,345
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

3399
05:54:54,107 --> 05:54:56,268
[SPEAKER_51]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

3400
05:54:56,926 --> 05:55:00,869
[SPEAKER_51]: What stands out to me is there's no call for study or analysis in this resolution.

3401
05:55:01,289 --> 05:55:04,231
[SPEAKER_51]: So opinions will still be the entire basis for the zoning.

3402
05:55:04,392 --> 05:55:06,813
[SPEAKER_51]: There's no set timeline or process outlined here.

3403
05:55:07,254 --> 05:55:16,340
[SPEAKER_51]: Why was this not brought forward in the planning and permitting committee in coordination with the mayor's office to create a real timeline and specific processes that might happen before new zoning is written?

3404
05:55:16,861 --> 05:55:20,143
[SPEAKER_51]: The zoning should be called back to planning and permitting and properly written.

3405
05:55:20,803 --> 05:55:24,184
[SPEAKER_51]: The unstudied Salem Street and Mystic Ave zoning should not remain intact.

3406
05:55:24,604 --> 05:55:29,885
[SPEAKER_51]: They were subjected to the same lack of analysis and study, so deserve the same treatment as the NR district's need.

3407
05:55:30,485 --> 05:55:37,607
[SPEAKER_51]: Reverting Park and Salem to MX2 added two floors of height and all the uses that were taken out as too close to the neighborhoods.

3408
05:55:37,987 --> 05:55:41,168
[SPEAKER_51]: So we resent that you're saying it's one change was not adopted.

3409
05:55:41,788 --> 05:55:51,230
[SPEAKER_51]: The parking minimum should be set before any zoning is passed and should reflect actual conditions, as even President Bierce has admitted cars are the primary transportation residents use.

3410
05:55:51,650 --> 05:55:57,651
[SPEAKER_51]: So the OR item to remove parking minimums is in direct contradiction of the reality of car ownership in Medford.

3411
05:55:58,311 --> 05:56:02,412
[SPEAKER_51]: There is no urgency to rezone and no need to rezone poorly.

3412
05:56:02,812 --> 05:56:05,813
[SPEAKER_51]: There are existing conditions analysis that must be done.

3413
05:56:06,273 --> 05:56:07,653
[SPEAKER_51]: Impacts must be considered.

3414
05:56:08,248 --> 05:56:10,751
[SPEAKER_51]: low to our infrastructure have to be factored in.

3415
05:56:10,971 --> 05:56:20,280
[SPEAKER_51]: All of these measures are called for in the comprehensive plan, climate plan, and housing production plan that this body mentions frequently, but is not following.

3416
05:56:20,961 --> 05:56:22,803
[SPEAKER_51]: You are not following any of these plans.

3417
05:56:22,963 --> 05:56:25,726
[SPEAKER_51]: It is not as simple as quote, we just need density.

3418
05:56:26,166 --> 05:56:32,052
[SPEAKER_51]: The new zoning as written encourages luxury housing and discourages affordable housing in many ways.

3419
05:56:32,596 --> 05:56:36,297
[SPEAKER_51]: It does not encourage businesses or vibrant commercial areas.

3420
05:56:36,838 --> 05:56:39,979
[SPEAKER_51]: Oversimplifying this process will be to our detriment.

3421
05:56:40,499 --> 05:56:43,460
[SPEAKER_51]: A strong path forward must include analysis.

3422
05:56:43,840 --> 05:56:49,703
[SPEAKER_51]: If Ennis is unable to perform the work appropriately, then perhaps we now should seek a different consultant.

3423
05:56:50,243 --> 05:56:53,604
[SPEAKER_51]: Our zoning is too important to be written without any solid basis.

3424
05:56:53,984 --> 05:56:58,546
[SPEAKER_51]: Doing something poorly and causing harm is not better than doing nothing.

3425
05:56:59,085 --> 05:57:02,709
[SPEAKER_51]: Opinions are not enough, no matter whose opinions they are.

3426
05:57:02,730 --> 05:57:03,631
[SPEAKER_51]: That's it.

3427
05:57:04,011 --> 05:57:04,331
[SPEAKER_51]: Thanks.

3428
05:57:07,655 --> 05:57:07,976
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

3429
05:57:07,996 --> 05:57:10,699
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

3430
05:57:10,759 --> 05:57:12,121
[SPEAKER_64]: At the podium, you'll have three minutes.

3431
05:57:12,751 --> 05:57:14,993
[SPEAKER_54]: Good evening, Mr. Alejo, 40 Robinson Road.

3432
05:57:15,393 --> 05:57:17,835
[SPEAKER_54]: So the first thing I'll say is just the late hour here.

3433
05:57:17,955 --> 05:57:20,718
[SPEAKER_54]: I mean, it's 1 AM, public comment is opening.

3434
05:57:20,778 --> 05:57:22,639
[SPEAKER_54]: This paper is extremely substantive.

3435
05:57:23,040 --> 05:57:24,581
[SPEAKER_54]: Like this chamber should be packed.

3436
05:57:24,741 --> 05:57:30,806
[SPEAKER_54]: And I'm sure a lot of people wanted to speak about this tonight, but couldn't because of how much time we spent on the other paper.

3437
05:57:31,647 --> 05:57:36,991
[SPEAKER_54]: I'll try to just be as condensed as possible with my thoughts on this matter.

3438
05:57:38,554 --> 05:57:40,135
[SPEAKER_54]: First of all, I'll start with the positive thing.

3439
05:57:40,315 --> 05:57:44,439
[SPEAKER_54]: That is, I do think it's a good thing to have these kind of press release statements on positions.

3440
05:57:44,959 --> 05:57:56,469
[SPEAKER_54]: So I appreciate that the council president did that in the form of a speech, and that the mayor released what could be called a press release, just basically saying where they're at.

3441
05:57:56,609 --> 05:57:58,530
[SPEAKER_54]: I think that's helpful for the public and following.

3442
05:57:58,670 --> 05:58:01,673
[SPEAKER_54]: So I would encourage putting things in writing so people can

3443
05:58:02,287 --> 05:58:05,568
[SPEAKER_54]: follow what's going on because really developments are happening rather fast.

3444
05:58:06,228 --> 05:58:10,149
[SPEAKER_54]: I don't support extending the INIS contract unless conditions are met.

3445
05:58:11,009 --> 05:58:26,754
[SPEAKER_54]: I think it's before we even talk about that, you know, first we have to say, obviously, you know, this is coming as a result of a pretty big public backlash against changes when residents actually started to become informed about what was going to happen if these changes were approved.

3446
05:58:26,834 --> 05:58:31,715
[SPEAKER_54]: So it goes to show you that we can't assume a louder

3447
05:58:32,642 --> 05:58:39,004
[SPEAKER_54]: vocal minority of activist residents are representative of what all residents think, right?

3448
05:58:39,024 --> 05:58:43,946
[SPEAKER_54]: And we have to also think about, yes, there were probably election concerns that got us to this point as well.

3449
05:58:44,986 --> 05:58:51,408
[SPEAKER_54]: So I think with the conditions that the mayor has put out there, I think generally they're pretty reasonable.

3450
05:58:51,848 --> 05:58:58,991
[SPEAKER_54]: But I think the first and most important one has to be restarting this process, given the concerns that have been expressed.

3451
05:59:00,333 --> 05:59:15,966
[SPEAKER_54]: And I don't think the Community Development Board, based on the feedback it has received, could in good conscience possibly recommend to you the map in its current form for a final vote, just because of all the feedback criticizing it that has been received.

3452
05:59:16,607 --> 05:59:25,334
[SPEAKER_54]: So I would encourage all of you to work with the mayor, try to reach an agreement here, and hopefully it's not just a repackaging of what has been extensively criticized.

3453
05:59:26,134 --> 05:59:28,917
[SPEAKER_54]: I think it's important that all of you proceed in good faith here.

3454
05:59:29,682 --> 05:59:37,608
[SPEAKER_54]: acknowledge this desire not for dramatic density increases that harms the character of our community.

3455
05:59:38,328 --> 05:59:43,171
[SPEAKER_54]: You know, people move to Medford because they don't want to live in a place like Somerville or Cambridge.

3456
05:59:43,552 --> 05:59:45,353
[SPEAKER_54]: It's not because they want a replica of it.

3457
05:59:46,454 --> 05:59:52,558
[SPEAKER_54]: We can address issues with housing demand without wiping out the reasons that Medford is a good place to live.

3458
05:59:53,539 --> 05:59:58,082
[SPEAKER_54]: It does offer this increasingly rare thing in the overpopulated world that we live in

3459
05:59:58,583 --> 06:00:00,585
[SPEAKER_54]: called home ownership.

3460
06:00:00,825 --> 06:00:07,591
[SPEAKER_54]: I think this kind of do or die alarmism that we've been seeing from people who think we need the density at all costs, I don't think it's helping anyone.

3461
06:00:07,891 --> 06:00:10,393
[SPEAKER_54]: And I think it's really ignoring this problem.

3462
06:00:10,433 --> 06:00:12,075
[SPEAKER_54]: Affordable housing is not a new one.

3463
06:00:13,096 --> 06:00:15,738
[SPEAKER_54]: This burden is really being placed disproportionately.

3464
06:00:15,938 --> 06:00:16,258
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

3465
06:00:16,278 --> 06:00:16,719
[SPEAKER_64]: That's time.

3466
06:00:17,519 --> 06:00:19,661
[SPEAKER_54]: On suburban communities like Medford.

3467
06:00:19,721 --> 06:00:21,142
[SPEAKER_54]: So work with the mayor.

3468
06:00:21,283 --> 06:00:21,643
[SPEAKER_54]: Thank you.

3469
06:00:24,320 --> 06:00:25,901
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go back to Zoom.

3470
06:00:26,582 --> 06:00:28,043
[SPEAKER_64]: Paige, name and address for the record.

3471
06:00:28,083 --> 06:00:28,904
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

3472
06:00:34,549 --> 06:00:34,950
[SPEAKER_57]: Go ahead.

3473
06:00:36,031 --> 06:00:37,292
[SPEAKER_57]: Hi there, Page Buldini.

3474
06:00:37,332 --> 06:00:38,273
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you for the late hour.

3475
06:00:40,110 --> 06:00:43,271
[SPEAKER_57]: 37 Winter Street and my business is 319 Boston Ave.

3476
06:00:43,911 --> 06:00:45,131
[SPEAKER_57]: I support zoning reform.

3477
06:00:45,171 --> 06:00:47,712
[SPEAKER_57]: We need this in our city, but we have to do it right.

3478
06:00:47,932 --> 06:00:48,632
[SPEAKER_57]: I appreciate Ms.

3479
06:00:48,732 --> 06:00:54,093
[SPEAKER_57]: Evans' perspective tonight and the honesty and openness from everyone here to build a stronger process.

3480
06:00:54,674 --> 06:00:59,675
[SPEAKER_57]: And I want to thank the mayor for acknowledging just how personal and emotional this has become for so many.

3481
06:01:00,475 --> 06:01:03,256
[SPEAKER_57]: Let's start when we're ready in our business district.

3482
06:01:03,776 --> 06:01:05,036
[SPEAKER_57]: That's how we bring in revenue,

3483
06:01:05,502 --> 06:01:08,124
[SPEAKER_57]: support our economy, and make sure zoning works.

3484
06:01:08,665 --> 06:01:15,310
[SPEAKER_57]: Let's strengthen our storefront programs, incentivize landlords, and build in protections for small businesses.

3485
06:01:16,111 --> 06:01:18,353
[SPEAKER_57]: Parking can't be an afterthought.

3486
06:01:18,533 --> 06:01:21,516
[SPEAKER_57]: It needs to be planned for every district from the start.

3487
06:01:22,597 --> 06:01:29,963
[SPEAKER_57]: I implore you to please speak directly with our city service providers, Medford Fire, Police,

3488
06:01:30,467 --> 06:01:37,495
[SPEAKER_57]: DPW and our schools and their union members and truly listen to their real life experience before moving forward.

3489
06:01:37,975 --> 06:01:43,921
[SPEAKER_57]: The comprehensive plan is a strong foundation but we need both the data and the real life input to guide us.

3490
06:01:44,642 --> 06:01:47,986
[SPEAKER_57]: And can we please if possible share a true updated timeline.

3491
06:01:48,580 --> 06:01:52,683
[SPEAKER_57]: I know how hard it is for everyone to keep up, even for those of us who are trying.

3492
06:01:53,524 --> 06:01:56,266
[SPEAKER_57]: Let's revisit Salem Street and Mystic Ave.

3493
06:01:56,466 --> 06:01:57,507
[SPEAKER_57]: Let's start with commercial.

3494
06:01:58,068 --> 06:02:00,590
[SPEAKER_57]: And when we get that right, then we move into residential.

3495
06:02:01,250 --> 06:02:03,092
[SPEAKER_57]: Let's take the time to get this right for Medford.

3496
06:02:03,970 --> 06:02:07,992
[SPEAKER_57]: And while we're at it, we've already seen what partnerships can look like.

3497
06:02:08,552 --> 06:02:13,755
[SPEAKER_57]: Tufts has agreed to fund a Boston Ave streetscape study.

3498
06:02:14,515 --> 06:02:18,717
[SPEAKER_57]: That's the kind of outside support that we should be seeking, and we can be successful.

3499
06:02:19,217 --> 06:02:19,818
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you, guys.

3500
06:02:20,058 --> 06:02:20,698
[SPEAKER_57]: Thank you very much.

3501
06:02:25,260 --> 06:02:26,641
[SPEAKER_64]: We will go to the podium.

3502
06:02:26,881 --> 06:02:28,262
[SPEAKER_64]: Name and address for the record, please.

3503
06:02:28,322 --> 06:02:29,322
[SPEAKER_64]: You will have three minutes.

3504
06:02:31,787 --> 06:02:36,030
[SPEAKER_75]: Michael Kesselman 99 Main Street, my name and address for a second.

3505
06:02:36,050 --> 06:02:41,715
[SPEAKER_75]: I want to point out a couple things.

3506
06:02:43,076 --> 06:02:50,942
[SPEAKER_75]: One, I mean, to be clear, there's mentioned like oh there's like this vocal minority in the city that's in favor of rezoning and densifying or.

3507
06:02:52,382 --> 06:02:58,588
[SPEAKER_75]: I live in South Medford, my strip of South Medford, I don't know a single person who isn't in favor of increased density.

3508
06:02:59,048 --> 06:03:03,012
[SPEAKER_75]: I'm a homeowner, I know a bunch of other homeowners, and we all are fine with increased density.

3509
06:03:03,452 --> 06:03:05,734
[SPEAKER_75]: Some of you seem to be under the impression that if

3510
06:03:06,927 --> 06:03:15,172
[SPEAKER_75]: your zone is up zone for increased density, Zack's gonna kick open your door and move you out and put a fucking skyscraper, I'm sorry.

3511
06:03:15,913 --> 06:03:19,495
[SPEAKER_75]: So like, that's not what, that just doesn't make sense.

3512
06:03:19,515 --> 06:03:20,355
[SPEAKER_75]: It's not what's gonna happen.

3513
06:03:20,836 --> 06:03:36,305
[SPEAKER_75]: You will still own your homes, your neighbors will still own their homes, but in the future, if they sell their home or if you sell your home, then you will have the option of selling to a developer that can build a more dense housing.

3514
06:03:37,115 --> 06:03:40,176
[SPEAKER_75]: At the end of the day, we need densification.

3515
06:03:40,436 --> 06:03:44,398
[SPEAKER_75]: We need to be able to give more people housing in our city.

3516
06:03:45,018 --> 06:03:49,419
[SPEAKER_75]: This is something that's hitting everywhere in the greater Boston metro area.

3517
06:03:50,020 --> 06:03:58,423
[SPEAKER_75]: I hesitate to call Medford a suburb because I'm from the Midwest originally, and suburbs here are not what we would call a suburb in the Midwest, by the way.

3518
06:03:59,523 --> 06:04:01,004
[SPEAKER_75]: This is a metropolitan area.

3519
06:04:01,064 --> 06:04:01,584
[SPEAKER_75]: This is a city.

3520
06:04:02,470 --> 06:04:04,152
[SPEAKER_75]: So we need to treat it like that.

3521
06:04:05,153 --> 06:04:11,879
[SPEAKER_75]: The other thing I want to quickly mention, which the previous commenter brought up, is that you want to do in this sort of like

3522
06:04:14,360 --> 06:04:20,666
[SPEAKER_75]: like sequential mode of first residential then commercial then whatever, that's not feasible, that doesn't make sense.

3523
06:04:21,066 --> 06:04:30,375
[SPEAKER_75]: If you are zoning, you need like commercial and residential need to be zoned together and updated together so that they can actually support each other in tandem for sustainable growth.

3524
06:04:30,995 --> 06:04:35,720
[SPEAKER_75]: This is just basic logic, how it has like you can't just back and forth go back and forth.

3525
06:04:36,200 --> 06:04:42,524
[SPEAKER_75]: If you don't have the housing, you don't have the residence to support the businesses, then that commercial zoning means squat.

3526
06:04:42,844 --> 06:04:54,211
[SPEAKER_75]: But if you don't have the commercial zoning to support people living in the increased residences, then you're not gonna have people who are gonna, you're not gonna have as many people wanna move in.

3527
06:04:54,691 --> 06:04:55,732
[SPEAKER_75]: Maybe, probably not.

3528
06:04:56,212 --> 06:05:02,095
[SPEAKER_75]: But point being, like, there's no reason to do this weird, like, sequential back and forth.

3529
06:05:02,676 --> 06:05:04,537
[SPEAKER_75]: And I'll say that, you know, from my perspective,

3530
06:05:05,238 --> 06:05:13,070
[SPEAKER_75]: I don't know, maybe it's from my work experience but it does not seem like this has been a fast process by any means.

3531
06:05:13,650 --> 06:05:15,613
[SPEAKER_75]: This has been going on for years.

3532
06:05:16,775 --> 06:05:18,838
[SPEAKER_75]: Not only has it been going on for years.

3533
06:05:20,500 --> 06:05:22,302
[SPEAKER_75]: It's been fairly transparent.

3534
06:05:22,562 --> 06:05:26,826
[SPEAKER_75]: If you want to know the information, it's not hard to find.

3535
06:05:27,026 --> 06:05:29,408
[SPEAKER_75]: It is on you at some point to find the information.

3536
06:05:29,468 --> 06:05:30,409
[SPEAKER_75]: You can find it.

3537
06:05:30,769 --> 06:05:35,493
[SPEAKER_75]: And if a Councilor won't give you that information, email a different Councilor.

3538
06:05:35,593 --> 06:05:38,356
[SPEAKER_75]: It's the council's job to give you that information.

3539
06:05:38,716 --> 06:05:39,937
[SPEAKER_75]: And they can, and they will.

3540
06:05:40,758 --> 06:05:41,138
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

3541
06:05:41,158 --> 06:05:46,223
[SPEAKER_62]: Name and address for the record, please.

3542
06:05:47,132 --> 06:05:49,534
[SPEAKER_36]: Hi, Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street.

3543
06:05:49,855 --> 06:05:53,178
[SPEAKER_36]: I think I have the honor of being the speaker at 1am today.

3544
06:05:54,379 --> 06:05:58,222
[SPEAKER_36]: If this was any other issue, I would not be here still.

3545
06:06:00,364 --> 06:06:10,474
[SPEAKER_36]: So, you know, I think there's been a lot of pernicious, for lack of a better word, mishegas that's been spewed around this, in particular,

3546
06:06:11,301 --> 06:06:16,703
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, I think there's been this narrative that, you know, this is going too fast.

3547
06:06:16,743 --> 06:06:24,627
[SPEAKER_36]: I think this narrative has been pushed out, you know, about every progressive thing that the city has done in the last six years.

3548
06:06:26,048 --> 06:06:30,069
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, we saw with the Columbus School, we saw with Prop two and a half stuff.

3549
06:06:31,630 --> 06:06:33,391
[SPEAKER_36]: And once again, we're hearing it now.

3550
06:06:34,745 --> 06:06:40,487
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm deeply disturbed by the mayor's conduct over the last couple of months.

3551
06:06:41,047 --> 06:06:42,288
[SPEAKER_36]: I find it unbecoming.

3552
06:06:43,068 --> 06:06:48,049
[SPEAKER_36]: I find it offensive that she would nuke this project after so many years.

3553
06:06:49,290 --> 06:06:57,932
[SPEAKER_36]: And, you know, I think Councilor Bears said that, you know, the mayor and he, you know, disagreed on how we got to this point.

3554
06:06:58,012 --> 06:07:02,854
[SPEAKER_36]: But, you know, as far as I can tell, the mayor's gone on the record saying that she wasn't paying attention to this.

3555
06:07:05,571 --> 06:07:27,337
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, we've seen tonight and over the last, you know, few weeks, you know, people on this city council and the mayor apparently herself throwing city staff under the bus in a way that I think is very inappropriate, but disturbingly part of a practice, a pattern of practice that goes back

3556
06:07:28,501 --> 06:07:36,932
[SPEAKER_36]: to Alicia Nunnally Benjamin, and other people who work for the city, to the drug testing staff at the city yard.

3557
06:07:37,673 --> 06:07:45,683
[SPEAKER_36]: There's been a consistent disrespect, disregard towards city staff, and I find it really just disturbing and grotesque.

3558
06:07:46,864 --> 06:07:55,730
[SPEAKER_36]: You know I was in this building last Wednesday I attended a meeting of the affordable housing trust fund, they're presenting a plan that they've been working on for the last year.

3559
06:08:00,313 --> 06:08:03,858
[SPEAKER_36]: There was I think going on in here installation of the poet laureate for the city.

3560
06:08:04,138 --> 06:08:06,942
[SPEAKER_36]: I think the mayor and some city Councilors were in attendance.

3561
06:08:07,603 --> 06:08:16,715
[SPEAKER_36]: And at some point, you know, Councilor bears dropped into the meeting, but who didn't drop into the meeting was Mayor Lungo-Koehn, despite the fact that she sits on that body.

3562
06:08:17,035 --> 06:08:30,746
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think it really goes to the approach of this incompetent person who is torpedoing or attempting to torpedo something that has been the product of years of work.

3563
06:08:31,527 --> 06:08:38,713
[SPEAKER_36]: And I just frankly like to quote the movie, I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.

3564
06:08:42,124 --> 06:08:48,768
[SPEAKER_36]: I wish more people were here to hear it, but I would really implore folks to write somebody in for mayor this fall.

3565
06:08:48,848 --> 06:08:52,731
[SPEAKER_36]: It's disgusting that she waited until after the filing deadline to respond.

3566
06:08:56,353 --> 06:08:57,233
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

3567
06:08:57,414 --> 06:08:58,574
[SPEAKER_64]: We're just going to hold really quickly.

3568
06:08:58,634 --> 06:09:00,295
[SPEAKER_64]: It sounds like the video may have gone out.

3569
06:09:01,676 --> 06:09:02,917
[SPEAKER_64]: Just a moment to go online.

3570
06:09:11,896 --> 06:09:14,356
[SPEAKER_64]: It's, it's, it is still live streaming to YouTube.

3571
06:09:15,857 --> 06:09:23,498
[SPEAKER_69]: Okay.

3572
06:09:24,718 --> 06:09:25,278
[SPEAKER_64]: Excuse me.

3573
06:09:25,778 --> 06:09:26,099
[SPEAKER_64]: We are.

3574
06:09:26,999 --> 06:09:27,399
[SPEAKER_64]: Hang on.

3575
06:09:27,499 --> 06:09:27,839
[SPEAKER_64]: Hang on.

3576
06:09:27,919 --> 06:09:29,079
[SPEAKER_64]: I am still chairing the meeting.

3577
06:09:29,099 --> 06:09:31,980
[SPEAKER_68]: Oh, well, why would it ever do that?

3578
06:09:45,487 --> 06:09:48,548
[SPEAKER_69]: All right, all right, everybody chill.

3579
06:09:55,473 --> 06:10:00,596
[SPEAKER_64]: All right, I'm sorry, we have to go back to Zoom because we're alternating.

3580
06:10:01,536 --> 06:10:03,598
[SPEAKER_64]: Sorry, we're gonna go back to Zoom before we go to you.

3581
06:10:06,339 --> 06:10:08,821
[SPEAKER_64]: All right, I'm still sharing, everybody be quiet.

3582
06:10:09,937 --> 06:10:11,118
[SPEAKER_64]: Okay, everybody be quiet.

3583
06:10:11,738 --> 06:10:13,319
[SPEAKER_64]: All the men that are talking, stop talking.

3584
06:10:15,641 --> 06:10:19,364
[SPEAKER_64]: William, I'm going to ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please.

3585
06:10:19,664 --> 06:10:20,524
[SPEAKER_64]: You'll have three minutes.

3586
06:10:23,206 --> 06:10:25,047
[SPEAKER_35]: Hello, thank you for recognizing me.

3587
06:10:25,948 --> 06:10:27,909
[SPEAKER_35]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

3588
06:10:29,039 --> 06:10:50,297
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to make the point that at the same time as the state legislature passed the MBTA Communities Act, they also took affirmative steps, the legislature and Republican Governor Charlie Baker, affirmative steps to make it easier for communities to zone for more multifamily housing beyond just the famous mandates that we all hear about with the MBTA Communities Act.

3589
06:10:50,898 --> 06:10:55,842
[SPEAKER_35]: They were responding to the fact that communities have long been way too cautious to say yes

3590
06:10:56,903 --> 06:11:13,648
[SPEAKER_35]: I think our mayor is demanding a level of caution about saying yes to more housing that is unwarranted and is exactly what everybody's trying to address and has identified as the reason why we keep getting housing crisis, keep getting more people pushed further, further away from the city.

3591
06:11:15,008 --> 06:11:17,269
[SPEAKER_35]: We need more caution about constantly saying no.

3592
06:11:18,449 --> 06:11:26,172
[SPEAKER_35]: I also think if this community is trying to say fossil fuels are against our values, then so is mandating parking.

3593
06:11:26,632 --> 06:11:35,815
[SPEAKER_35]: Continuing a parking-first development model is going to ensure that the next generation is as car-dependent as the present generation.

3594
06:11:37,335 --> 06:11:51,787
[SPEAKER_35]: the city council working to make tough choices to address the housing crisis at something close to, I don't think it's quite there, but something close to the scale required to address the issue is commendable.

3595
06:11:52,587 --> 06:11:56,250
[SPEAKER_35]: And I encourage you guys to keep at it.

3596
06:11:56,310 --> 06:11:56,691
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

3597
06:12:00,154 --> 06:12:00,574
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

3598
06:12:01,395 --> 06:12:02,335
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll go back to the podium.

3599
06:12:03,416 --> 06:12:04,077
[SPEAKER_64]: We'll have three minutes.

3600
06:12:05,768 --> 06:12:07,289
[SPEAKER_38]: Mayor 373 Riverside Ave.

3601
06:12:10,310 --> 06:12:15,053
[SPEAKER_38]: One of the things that I've been hearing tonight is a fear of sunk cost.

3602
06:12:16,053 --> 06:12:21,096
[SPEAKER_38]: It's a common argument that happens in a lot of problems, right, especially long term projects.

3603
06:12:21,817 --> 06:12:29,781
[SPEAKER_38]: And we can't possibly, you know, not do something because of the sunk cost that's happened, whether it's time, money, both.

3604
06:12:32,547 --> 06:12:38,774
[SPEAKER_38]: Personally, I've heard more about zoning than I ever want to in my life, and probably the same as most of you.

3605
06:12:40,948 --> 06:12:57,251
[SPEAKER_38]: the way that some of the information has been presented along the way, and I've been to CDB meetings, I've been to city council meetings, some of the way that the maps were presented in the before and after was not as well done as maybe it could have been.

3606
06:12:58,511 --> 06:13:06,472
[SPEAKER_38]: I guess a question for the council is, besides Innis, are there other outfits that maybe could have done a better job?

3607
06:13:06,552 --> 06:13:08,933
[SPEAKER_38]: And now that there's an opportunity here to

3608
06:13:10,733 --> 06:13:12,695
[SPEAKER_38]: do a little reflection.

3609
06:13:15,557 --> 06:13:19,860
[SPEAKER_38]: If you had your wish, right, you want $150,000 to keep Innis going.

3610
06:13:21,841 --> 06:13:30,587
[SPEAKER_38]: Would it not also be worth considering, I want $200,000 to have a different company maybe that could communicate or perform better?

3611
06:13:30,607 --> 06:13:31,288
[SPEAKER_38]: I don't know.

3612
06:13:31,708 --> 06:13:35,771
[SPEAKER_38]: I would just say, consider that and maybe use this opportunity

3613
06:13:36,362 --> 06:13:44,107
[SPEAKER_38]: right, if there are better alternatives or other things you can consider, right, besides just worrying about the sunk costs specifically with a particular company.

3614
06:13:45,268 --> 06:13:45,548
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

3615
06:13:47,370 --> 06:13:47,810
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

3616
06:13:50,692 --> 06:13:51,993
[SPEAKER_64]: We will go back to Zoom.

3617
06:13:55,135 --> 06:13:57,316
[SPEAKER_64]: Crystal, name and address for the record, please.

3618
06:13:57,436 --> 06:13:58,117
[SPEAKER_64]: You have three minutes.

3619
06:14:06,568 --> 06:14:08,869
[SPEAKER_62]: Hi, my name is Crystal Huff.

3620
06:14:09,109 --> 06:14:10,289
[SPEAKER_62]: My pronouns are they, them.

3621
06:14:10,569 --> 06:14:14,390
[SPEAKER_62]: My address is actually in Ward 5 of Somerville.

3622
06:14:14,670 --> 06:14:18,412
[SPEAKER_62]: I'm a volunteer with Mutual Aid of Medford and Somerville, MAMAS.

3623
06:14:19,792 --> 06:14:32,216
[SPEAKER_62]: And I just wanted to say as someone who does a lot of volunteer work in both communities that I and others in MAMAS really appreciate anything that you can do to build more housing.

3624
06:14:32,556 --> 06:14:32,916
[SPEAKER_62]: Thank you.

3625
06:14:36,319 --> 06:14:37,160
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you for your comments.

3626
06:14:43,064 --> 06:14:43,565
[SPEAKER_64]: Back to you.

3627
06:14:45,286 --> 06:14:46,928
[SPEAKER_36]: Sam Goldstein, 29 Martin Street.

3628
06:14:47,748 --> 06:14:58,397
[SPEAKER_36]: I just wanted to note another and frankly, like the maybe most concerning piece of what's been going on, which is that

3629
06:14:58,975 --> 06:15:20,728
[SPEAKER_36]: The outreach that the city, that the mayor has conducted around this has put to use particular methods of contact that heavily bias outreach towards single family homeowners, people who live in the city.

3630
06:15:21,322 --> 06:15:25,824
[SPEAKER_36]: the houses that they own, so specifically the tax bill letters, right?

3631
06:15:25,944 --> 06:15:29,105
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm a renter, I don't see my landlord's tax bill.

3632
06:15:31,326 --> 06:15:35,707
[SPEAKER_36]: And neither do the majority of residents in this city who also rent.

3633
06:15:38,068 --> 06:15:46,752
[SPEAKER_36]: So that's one thing, similarly with the reverse, excuse me, it's late, reverse 911 outreach.

3634
06:15:47,252 --> 06:15:50,073
[SPEAKER_36]: Presumably this is going out over landlines primarily,

3635
06:15:50,704 --> 06:15:56,128
[SPEAKER_36]: That is also biased towards older folks who have a landline.

3636
06:15:58,710 --> 06:16:09,257
[SPEAKER_36]: And much of this outreach has, again, been conducted over Facebook, which, like the other modes of contact, is biased towards older voters.

3637
06:16:09,298 --> 06:16:13,781
[SPEAKER_36]: Younger folks tend to use other social media platforms, not beyond social media.

3638
06:16:14,181 --> 06:16:19,265
[SPEAKER_36]: So I just want to make the very clear point here that I hope that going forward, whatever contact

3639
06:16:20,486 --> 06:16:43,062
[SPEAKER_36]: you know, occurs, it doesn't merely, you know, focus on like, you know, not lying and having like consistent like verbiage, but that the mode of contact is one that isn't biased towards, towards turning out a particular group, because I think that, you know, the city's kind of been, you know, going to the bathroom where it eats.

3640
06:16:48,823 --> 06:16:50,585
[SPEAKER_64]: All right, final speaker.

3641
06:16:55,649 --> 06:16:57,070
[SPEAKER_75]: Yeah, Michael Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

3642
06:16:57,510 --> 06:17:03,455
[SPEAKER_75]: I just wanted to make one last comment about, yeah, the mayor's mode of communications.

3643
06:17:04,496 --> 06:17:15,044
[SPEAKER_75]: Actually, what I think would be wonderful to see is if the mayor gave an articulated, an actual explanation of how

3644
06:17:16,543 --> 06:17:21,044
[SPEAKER_75]: this process could get to this point without her knowing anything.

3645
06:17:21,604 --> 06:17:25,285
[SPEAKER_75]: Because that's wildly incompetent and negligent.

3646
06:17:25,846 --> 06:17:27,486
[SPEAKER_75]: Like that's crazy.

3647
06:17:28,426 --> 06:17:33,908
[SPEAKER_75]: And it really can't be understated how unacceptable that is.

3648
06:17:34,128 --> 06:17:40,790
[SPEAKER_75]: And everyone who watches this council session and votes should really think about that because

3649
06:17:41,765 --> 06:17:43,546
[SPEAKER_75]: Yo, like this is her job.

3650
06:17:44,366 --> 06:17:45,186
[SPEAKER_75]: This is her job.

3651
06:17:45,866 --> 06:17:50,768
[SPEAKER_75]: And she didn't know what was going on until residents emailed her, even though people like, what?

3652
06:17:51,468 --> 06:17:52,128
[SPEAKER_75]: It's fakakta.

3653
06:17:57,190 --> 06:17:58,310
[SPEAKER_64]: You're welcome to stand at the podium.

3654
06:18:03,932 --> 06:18:06,956
[SPEAKER_43]: Paulette Vartabedian, 27 Central Lab Medford.

3655
06:18:07,276 --> 06:18:10,960
[SPEAKER_43]: I just want to comment on some of the earlier comments that were made.

3656
06:18:14,111 --> 06:18:15,572
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm from the Salem Street District.

3657
06:18:15,612 --> 06:18:16,573
[SPEAKER_43]: I think everyone knows.

3658
06:18:17,194 --> 06:18:27,862
[SPEAKER_43]: So when the methadone dispensary or clinic was first brought in, no one knew about it.

3659
06:18:28,583 --> 06:18:30,284
[SPEAKER_43]: Even the abutters didn't know about it.

3660
06:18:30,424 --> 06:18:34,288
[SPEAKER_43]: And that's what woke up the sleeping lion in our district.

3661
06:18:34,628 --> 06:18:39,952
[SPEAKER_43]: And since then, a lot more people citywide have been involved because things that have been,

3662
06:18:41,494 --> 06:18:43,356
[SPEAKER_43]: proposed have affected them.

3663
06:18:43,776 --> 06:18:46,359
[SPEAKER_43]: When things affect someone, that's when you open your eyes.

3664
06:18:47,260 --> 06:18:51,805
[SPEAKER_43]: Have I been foolish by not paying more attention before?

3665
06:18:52,005 --> 06:18:53,667
[SPEAKER_43]: Sure, I'll take that responsibility.

3666
06:18:54,108 --> 06:18:54,909
[SPEAKER_43]: But that is

3667
06:18:56,754 --> 06:19:06,577
[SPEAKER_43]: from everyone I know, and I know a lot of people, that that was the beginning of the distrust of this city council because it was like snuck in.

3668
06:19:06,918 --> 06:19:20,582
[SPEAKER_43]: And then with these latest changes that have happened after that meeting at the Roberts, we didn't want medical because we were afraid of that methadone coming in in an inappropriate area again.

3669
06:19:21,042 --> 06:19:21,763
[SPEAKER_43]: And what happened?

3670
06:19:22,183 --> 06:19:25,204
[SPEAKER_43]: The council changed it back so medical can come in.

3671
06:19:27,156 --> 06:19:29,097
[SPEAKER_43]: Well, that's what we think.

3672
06:19:30,078 --> 06:19:39,762
[SPEAKER_43]: When we were called NIMBYs, because we didn't want it in our neighborhood, but when we said, have it in West Medford, it's right on a commuter rail, you have tons of open stores.

3673
06:19:40,162 --> 06:19:41,603
[SPEAKER_43]: Oh, no, there's a school there.

3674
06:19:41,923 --> 06:19:44,744
[SPEAKER_43]: So it's okay to have it near our school, but not your school.

3675
06:19:45,425 --> 06:19:48,026
[SPEAKER_43]: This is part of the beginning of the distrust.

3676
06:19:48,646 --> 06:19:54,989
[SPEAKER_43]: Also, I was at that meeting when Councilor Leming at midnight made the amendment to change

3677
06:19:55,837 --> 06:20:01,779
[SPEAKER_43]: some of the zoning and community development board's recommendations.

3678
06:20:02,959 --> 06:20:05,660
[SPEAKER_43]: I was speechless, and that's pretty rare.

3679
06:20:07,100 --> 06:20:13,042
[SPEAKER_43]: So these are the reasons why the residents distrust the council.

3680
06:20:13,482 --> 06:20:14,902
[SPEAKER_43]: Now, we're not privy to everything.

3681
06:20:14,922 --> 06:20:15,402
[SPEAKER_43]: You are.

3682
06:20:15,722 --> 06:20:16,323
[SPEAKER_43]: We can only

3683
06:20:19,046 --> 06:20:21,507
[SPEAKER_43]: make our opinions from what we see and hear.

3684
06:20:22,007 --> 06:20:26,368
[SPEAKER_43]: So I'm just asking you, we are not against change.

3685
06:20:26,468 --> 06:20:27,388
[SPEAKER_43]: We want change.

3686
06:20:27,468 --> 06:20:31,849
[SPEAKER_43]: Salem Street has been the way it was since I was a kid.

3687
06:20:31,949 --> 06:20:32,730
[SPEAKER_43]: That's a long time.

3688
06:20:33,670 --> 06:20:39,031
[SPEAKER_43]: We need changes in zoning, but just not to the extent.

3689
06:20:40,872 --> 06:20:45,313
[SPEAKER_43]: We want to live in our area without being

3690
06:20:48,115 --> 06:20:48,955
[SPEAKER_43]: Oh, I had the word.

3691
06:20:50,916 --> 06:20:55,137
[SPEAKER_43]: The quality of life needs to stay pretty much the same.

3692
06:20:55,157 --> 06:20:59,298
[SPEAKER_43]: Now, does that mean you don't have to have three-story buildings?

3693
06:20:59,418 --> 06:21:08,960
[SPEAKER_43]: No, but six, seven-story buildings is going to affect the quality of life for people that are used to living in single-family, tree-lined streets.

3694
06:21:09,220 --> 06:21:10,961
[SPEAKER_43]: So please, take your time.

3695
06:21:11,341 --> 06:21:12,601
[SPEAKER_43]: Do it right the first time.

3696
06:21:12,881 --> 06:21:15,562
[SPEAKER_43]: Don't let this be another Ring Road fiasco.

3697
06:21:15,922 --> 06:21:16,382
[SPEAKER_43]: Thank you.

3698
06:21:16,422 --> 06:21:17,003
[SPEAKER_64]: Thanks, Paula.

3699
06:21:18,524 --> 06:21:20,566
[SPEAKER_64]: And just a really quick point of information.

3700
06:21:20,606 --> 06:21:32,375
[SPEAKER_64]: I just want to clarify that the proposed substance abuse disorder treatment clinic, not a council project.

3701
06:21:32,955 --> 06:21:36,478
[SPEAKER_64]: The city council is not and cannot be involved in recruitment.

3702
06:21:37,879 --> 06:21:49,648
[SPEAKER_64]: of specific business entities to parcels where those uses are legally allowed, which was the case for that entity on Salem Street when it was proposed.

3703
06:21:55,025 --> 06:22:00,527
[SPEAKER_64]: I'm just restating that to state it as a city council project is not accurate.

3704
06:22:01,207 --> 06:22:14,772
[SPEAKER_64]: And I think part of what we're talking about this evening is trying to get the city to invest in communication resources so that disinformation like that will not proliferate so deeply into the community.

3705
06:22:15,612 --> 06:22:17,313
[SPEAKER_64]: I'll go back to President Bears and then we'll take a vote.

3706
06:22:19,150 --> 06:22:19,390
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks.

3707
06:22:19,530 --> 06:22:24,995
[SPEAKER_24]: One of the recommendations of the Community Development Board was not to allow medical uses in the entire Salem Street corridor.

3708
06:22:25,676 --> 06:22:26,477
[SPEAKER_24]: And we accepted that.

3709
06:22:27,338 --> 06:22:29,760
[SPEAKER_24]: There's no medical uses allowed in the Salem Street corridor.

3710
06:22:37,687 --> 06:22:39,809
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, but it doesn't allow that was

3711
06:22:42,193 --> 06:22:49,655
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, it adopted a proposal so that you can't, it changed the medical use, like we did not adopt the medical piece of things.

3712
06:22:51,275 --> 06:22:56,317
[SPEAKER_24]: So you can't have the same proposal that went to the CD board last year.

3713
06:22:56,337 --> 06:22:59,077
[SPEAKER_24]: That wasn't even allowed.

3714
06:22:59,157 --> 06:22:59,798
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what I'm saying.

3715
06:22:59,818 --> 06:23:04,699
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just saying we didn't reverse that recommendation.

3716
06:23:05,499 --> 06:23:08,660
[SPEAKER_24]: So anyone who's saying that we reversed that recommendation is not telling the truth.

3717
06:23:11,063 --> 06:23:13,345
[SPEAKER_64]: Okay, one mic, we can't hear you, Councilor Lazzaro.

3718
06:23:15,246 --> 06:23:18,349
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not talking about the proposed clinic from last year.

3719
06:23:18,389 --> 06:23:35,022
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm saying that when it came to the zoning, one of the community development board's recommendations was to create only a neighborhood medical use that allowed very limited medical things to address potentially impactful medical uses like what you're talking about.

3720
06:23:35,742 --> 06:23:39,245
[SPEAKER_24]: People have said the council threw that away and took that away.

3721
06:23:40,013 --> 06:23:40,954
[SPEAKER_24]: We did not do that.

3722
06:23:41,774 --> 06:23:43,836
[SPEAKER_24]: That recommendation was adopted.

3723
06:23:44,376 --> 06:23:47,238
[SPEAKER_24]: So it just goes back to this larger point, right?

3724
06:23:47,438 --> 06:23:59,807
[SPEAKER_24]: People are, you know, incorrect information goes out there, it suits a narrative, it gets repeated, people believe it, and then it gets continued.

3725
06:23:59,827 --> 06:24:01,007
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a never ending cycle.

3726
06:24:01,548 --> 06:24:02,929
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not really worth our time at this point.

3727
06:24:12,921 --> 06:24:13,830
[SPEAKER_64]: to wrap up the discussion.

3728
06:24:20,280 --> 06:24:32,226
[SPEAKER_64]: one councilor, I think that there's a way that the mayor could choose to make appropriations around the zoning project that would reveal a genuine interest in collaborating and getting good information out to the people of Medford, all of whom I think are interested in participating in this in good faith.

3729
06:24:32,987 --> 06:24:42,992
[SPEAKER_64]: And there's another way of doing that that reveals nothing more than a desire to throw the city council under the bus and erase the perspectives of people who have been in favor of zoning reform, no matter where you fall on that spectrum.

3730
06:24:43,472 --> 06:24:45,513
[SPEAKER_64]: And I certainly hope that we can move forward with the first one.

3731
06:24:47,854 --> 06:24:49,855
[SPEAKER_64]: We're going to take the B paper first.

3732
06:24:51,996 --> 06:24:53,336
[SPEAKER_64]: Mr. Clerk, do you have that language?

3733
06:24:53,396 --> 06:24:55,477
[SPEAKER_64]: Cause I definitely don't.

3734
06:24:55,858 --> 06:25:13,025
[SPEAKER_68]: It was, um, the, the version that the, the final version, which is the one that seems to be, uh, the one that's been agreed upon, uh, to put before the council was, uh, to find out what the CD board recommended, uh, what, what CD board recommendations were accepted, uh, for Salem street and what were not.

3735
06:25:17,485 --> 06:25:17,905
[SPEAKER_64]: President Bears.

3736
06:25:18,826 --> 06:25:36,277
[SPEAKER_24]: I came in specifically to request that the Planning and Development and Sustainability Office issue a public statement about what CD board recommendations were accepted by the council, and they can refer to the March 11th council records, which I read earlier in this meeting.

3737
06:25:36,297 --> 06:25:40,300
[SPEAKER_64]: Thank you.

3738
06:25:40,580 --> 06:25:42,742
[SPEAKER_64]: They were approved by a vote of this council.

3739
06:25:47,363 --> 06:26:11,830
[SPEAKER_64]: On the B paper by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by President Bears for the CDB to release a public statement referring to the March 11th records of the City Council articulating the recommendations of the CDB on the Salem Street zoning district and the ensuing Council vote on those recommendations.

3740
06:26:12,390 --> 06:26:14,071
[SPEAKER_64]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

3741
06:26:15,091 --> 06:26:15,591
[SPEAKER_68]: President Bears.

3742
06:26:17,911 --> 06:26:18,952
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Callahan is absent.

3743
06:26:20,353 --> 06:26:21,114
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Lazzaro?

3744
06:26:21,454 --> 06:26:21,594
Yes.

3745
06:26:23,055 --> 06:26:23,596
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Leming?

3746
06:26:23,616 --> 06:26:25,777
[SPEAKER_68]: Yes.

3747
06:26:25,797 --> 06:26:26,418
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Scarpelli?

3748
06:26:26,438 --> 06:26:26,538
[SPEAKER_68]: Yes.

3749
06:26:27,819 --> 06:26:28,359
[SPEAKER_68]: Councilor Tseng?

3750
06:26:28,960 --> 06:26:29,200
[SPEAKER_68]: Yes.

3751
06:26:31,022 --> 06:26:31,882
[SPEAKER_68]: Vice President Collins?

3752
06:26:32,683 --> 06:26:32,923
[SPEAKER_64]: Yes.

3753
06:26:33,404 --> 06:26:35,545
[SPEAKER_64]: Six in favor, one absent.

3754
06:26:35,625 --> 06:26:36,526
[SPEAKER_64]: The motion passes.

3755
06:26:37,147 --> 06:26:39,709
[SPEAKER_64]: I see President Bears and then Councilor Leming.

3756
06:26:41,030 --> 06:26:41,250
[SPEAKER_64]: Okay.

3757
06:26:41,990 --> 06:26:42,991
[SPEAKER_64]: Councilor Leming, do you have a comment?

3758
06:26:43,291 --> 06:26:43,432
[SPEAKER_64]: No.

3759
06:26:43,692 --> 06:26:43,852
[SPEAKER_64]: Great.

3760
06:26:45,839 --> 06:26:54,363
