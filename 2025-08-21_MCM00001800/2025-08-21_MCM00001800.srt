1
00:00:00,652 --> 00:00:03,173
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd be like, yeah, everything looks good.

2
00:00:03,273 --> 00:00:09,275
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a procedure that was documented how we were going to do it.

3
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:10,256
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was in a meeting.

4
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:17,018
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's a problem.

5
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,479
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the procedure's documented there.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was tended to that, right?

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,542
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a written procedure so that we were following the procedure as opposed to just...

8
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:45,823
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't think... Well, I will tell you, I do remember signing bodies that we were here a while, way back in the day, but... Well, there was a time when, I think, I mean, hold on, hold on a sec, but anyway, I think we're out of this.

9
00:00:45,863 --> 00:00:51,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Shouldn't somebody prepare these boss checks and... Our role at this point is just...

10
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:05,772
[SPEAKER_01]: confirming that these need our exemptions and we're doing our statutory authority as opposed to saying that three individual people reviewed every single.

11
00:01:08,355 --> 00:01:08,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.

12
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,379
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's kick it off.

13
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:14,422
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll call the meeting to order F4-OP.

14
00:01:21,808 --> 00:01:26,899
[SPEAKER_00]: And first on the agenda which you have in front of you is approval of the minutes from the June meeting.

15
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:54,223
[SPEAKER_00]: And of note, the only thing in those minutes of note for this meeting is there were uncollectible personal properties that came in within 48 hours of this meeting.

16
00:01:54,283 --> 00:02:00,765
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was not anticipated within the 48 hours, which we can add to this meeting.

17
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:05,487
[SPEAKER_00]: So this additional personal property from fiscal 04 to fiscal 22 from the treasury collector that

18
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:10,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, she was unable to collect those.

19
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:13,570
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not from Boston from this.

20
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was carried over, which we, you know, I couldn't reasonably anticipate within 48 hours.

21
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:22,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not on the agenda, but we will be taking up the personal property.

22
00:02:22,593 --> 00:02:25,014
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make that enough to carry over from June.

23
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:26,274
[SPEAKER_00]: The June minutes second.

24
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:54,004
[SPEAKER_00]: And then moving on, the next would just be the motor vehicle review of a bathements, which are all right here.

25
00:02:54,024 --> 00:03:00,447
[SPEAKER_00]: The only one that was not in the packet that you guys got on email is this top one here.

26
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:01,767
[SPEAKER_00]: She used that at last minute today.

27
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:02,547
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a few.

28
00:03:02,588 --> 00:03:05,869
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to take a peek at that, everything else was on the email.

29
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:09,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I didn't have to look at them only because I didn't get the review.

30
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:16,613
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to get my login changed because it only comes into one.

31
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was trying to send it to iCloud account as well, so just to... Oh, okay, so... Did you send it?

32
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:25,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I didn't send it, so Maria, but you sent it to me.

33
00:03:25,534 --> 00:03:25,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

34
00:03:26,054 --> 00:03:29,476
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'll get that fixed, but I'll run it out and just go to the... Okay.

35
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:31,797
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it doesn't take long to review these.

36
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:51,082
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're signing off on us for all of these, right?

37
00:03:51,102 --> 00:03:51,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

38
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:51,723
Yeah.

39
00:03:57,745 --> 00:03:57,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

40
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:08,168
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example of a procedure that was set up so that these could be done with one signature rather than after it was approved.

41
00:04:08,788 --> 00:04:09,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

42
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:14,870
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you told to that tonight, this huge backlog of exercise and people call.

43
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:33,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there'll be 12 packets per if it was 11.

44
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:02,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need a motion to approve those?

45
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:07,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as long as everything's good, she's already signed, so we can just make a motion.

46
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:19,617
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, third up is the fourth commitment for motor vehicle excise.

47
00:06:24,924 --> 00:06:25,464
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

48
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:29,246
[SPEAKER_00]: And then moving on to the big one is the exemptions.

49
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:29,806
[SPEAKER_00]: So

50
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:43,171
[SPEAKER_00]: I previously, this week, reviewed all of the exemptions that have come in so far from July 1 through today or through Friday of last week.

51
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:55,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Rita vetted them, I vetted them, put together a pivot table from Excel as well as documentation on each one of the exemptions that came in.

52
00:06:55,201 --> 00:06:57,183
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the record, we have 13, 37

53
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:13,966
[SPEAKER_00]: exemptions, plus 37 exemptions, two 17Ds, 12 22Ds, one 41A deferral, 17 CPA exemptions for just CPA.

54
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:23,113
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some exemptions that also get a CPA automatically, the 22Ds, the 41Cs, and then the deferral as well.

55
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:23,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So

56
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:32,253
[SPEAKER_00]: that gives us a total of 57 CPA exemptions, but there are only truly 17 exemptions that apply only to CPA.

57
00:07:32,273 --> 00:07:37,734
[SPEAKER_00]: 27 41 C's, last 41 C's, 75 veteran 22 A's, that's the 10 to 90 percent, the veteran spouse 22 D's,

58
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:59,284
[SPEAKER_00]: The 22 capital E, which is 100% disabled, 39, and the 22, 100% disabled that live in a two-family didn't get half of the total amount because of the two-family.

59
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:01,125
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a total of five.

60
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:09,369
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a summary of each one of these pages here that should correlate to that number.

61
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And the exemptions are there.

62
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,892
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I walked through those with Rita.

63
00:08:16,805 --> 00:08:23,307
[SPEAKER_00]: And this would be a summary of each one of those piles that we can add to the top of each one of those packets.

64
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:26,268
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can go around if we'd like.

65
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:27,488
[SPEAKER_00]: We just sign as one by one.

66
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:36,110
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order, this would be plus 37, which has 13 total exemptions that were approved.

67
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:41,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Jared, can you give me that sheet that you just referred to the hill?

68
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:43,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious.

69
00:08:43,853 --> 00:08:45,093
[SPEAKER_01]: How does this compare to

70
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:47,466
[SPEAKER_01]: prior to this?

71
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:54,531
[SPEAKER_00]: We are actually a little bit lower currently than we were in previous years.

72
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:59,155
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because we had the meeting a little bit later last year.

73
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:00,456
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say we were all right on track.

74
00:09:01,516 --> 00:09:07,041
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had asked Rita before she left what we were looking like.

75
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:09,803
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are repeats, specifically the veterans.

76
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:11,204
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the same ones every year.

77
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:13,345
[SPEAKER_00]: So we should be right on track.

78
00:09:13,365 --> 00:09:15,227
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were right around 300-ish last year.

79
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:19,874
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the change, the 22E versus the 22A?

80
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:24,016
[SPEAKER_00]: The 20, there should be the documentation right next to it.

81
00:09:24,976 --> 00:09:26,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's my notes here.

82
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:27,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe, that was a correction that I made.

83
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:32,680
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rita had put in an E as an A instead of, so that was still flipped.

84
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so it was, okay.

85
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:42,584
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really, it's not a status change of the- No, it's just, yeah, it was just a data correction change in vision, but the logs are correct.

86
00:09:43,424 --> 00:09:43,624
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

87
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:45,625
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

88
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:47,838
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this packet there.

89
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:48,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

90
00:09:48,178 --> 00:09:51,260
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I like to do is these are readers logs.

91
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,901
[SPEAKER_00]: These numbers are all accurate here.

92
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:59,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a previously well, she should be entering them in vision so that we can pull a report out.

93
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:03,088
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to tie these and this is a check on what we have in vision.

94
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:04,609
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a full report at the end of the year.

95
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:08,371
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I vetted on Monday along with looking at all the exemptions.

96
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:09,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

97
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:14,335
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and just to confirm it, this signature sheet will be attached to each

98
00:10:15,488 --> 00:10:16,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

99
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:23,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one, yeah, the 37s will be tied to each one of those applications, yeah.

100
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:26,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, from the side of the top page.

101
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,750
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we've already signed them, so.

102
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, yeah, those are the 41Cs.

103
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:32,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

104
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:33,191
[SPEAKER_00]: So does this go with this?

105
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:33,751
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the 37s

106
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:46,038
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we can do that.

107
00:11:15,222 --> 00:11:19,406
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's adequate in the vision program.

108
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:21,307
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like to tie it at the end.

109
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:24,169
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have it total, and then we'll do it automatically.

110
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:26,571
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this situation, plus 37 is 437.50 per, and we have 13 total.

111
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:27,412
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll make some notes.

112
00:11:27,432 --> 00:11:29,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the 37s plus 37, it's a grand total of 5687.50.

113
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:54,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the 37 steps.

114
00:11:54,273 --> 00:11:55,973
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you want this with that?

115
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:56,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we could.

116
00:11:56,694 --> 00:11:57,974
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just start making a file.

117
00:11:58,355 --> 00:11:58,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

118
00:11:59,015 --> 00:12:00,716
[SPEAKER_00]: Just set them, flip them over.

119
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:03,417
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be doing that.

120
00:12:03,537 --> 00:12:04,318
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

121
00:12:04,678 --> 00:12:08,040
[SPEAKER_00]: So going down the line, next we have 17 Ds.

122
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,981
[SPEAKER_00]: There should just be two of them.

123
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:12,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Sassina, you're not aware.

124
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:12,182
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

125
00:12:12,202 --> 00:12:12,362
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

126
00:12:12,502 --> 00:12:17,805
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're not.

127
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,781
[SPEAKER_02]: of last year.

128
00:12:24,261 --> 00:12:31,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, last year, 34.

129
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:33,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And then next to me to capital D.

130
00:12:43,445 --> 00:12:46,808
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the no tax bill.

131
00:12:46,848 --> 00:12:53,333
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't have a number on that until we actually commit the values and the tax rate, and then we put them in later.

132
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:54,734
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a deceased bed.

133
00:12:58,757 --> 00:13:03,942
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a total of 12 of these through last Friday.

134
00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:11,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, with the national vaccine,

135
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:13,701
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 22D should be... 22E.

136
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:13,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

137
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:14,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

138
00:13:41,977 --> 00:13:42,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

139
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:43,632
[SPEAKER_00]: and then on to the next one 41a which is just one it's the same thing it's a senior deferral now we just we counted within the exemption number for the year but this technically it's a deferral they're not giving money away they're just choosing the defer the tax and it should be just the one.

140
00:14:43,652 --> 00:14:46,453
[SPEAKER_00]: So does that impact the

141
00:14:49,116 --> 00:15:16,112
[SPEAKER_00]: uh it does in does not because we don't collect it in the year but it doesn't get it basically gets kicked down the road but it does get it reduces that the overlay that's a good question i don't know how they balance it out in the books because we're not writing we're not saying that it's they don't owe it they just are choosing to defer it at an interest rate i guess that's not our problem but you would think

142
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:33,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so they just, because then the money doesn't matter.

143
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and it comes back within, I think it's an 8% interest rate.

144
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:42,873
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so 41A is still on that.

145
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:53,517
[SPEAKER_00]: And next up is the CPAs, the 17 that are just being CPs, and that are not tied to another exemption, that the CPA would come off automatically.

146
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:00,135
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

147
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:09,668
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the 41 C's, the senior lower income.

148
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:26,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are 27 of those as of last Friday.

149
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:07,047
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 22 A's.

150
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:11,549
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the 10 to 90% disabled.

151
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,870
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be great to put it over here.

152
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,790
[SPEAKER_02]: And our 76.

153
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:36,674
[SPEAKER_00]: most of them were bleached.

154
00:18:37,194 --> 00:18:43,082
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets to the veterans, right, so anything that has a V in front of it here, most of these are repeats.

155
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:49,590
[SPEAKER_00]: As of, I think it was fiscal 24, we started requiring them to give us their veterans

156
00:18:55,691 --> 00:18:56,832
[SPEAKER_00]: even if they got it last year.

157
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:58,973
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of them are used to it now.

158
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,974
[SPEAKER_03]: The first year was like, we gave that to you already.

159
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:05,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they get the same letter or is it one letter that they get and then they never get it again?

160
00:19:05,557 --> 00:19:06,558
[SPEAKER_00]: They get it every year.

161
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,360
[SPEAKER_00]: They get it every year and we just have them.

162
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,641
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way there's no confusion.

163
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:20,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there on the, that's part of the application and says their disabled status or percentage.

164
00:19:42,542 --> 00:19:46,516
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 22 of these, I can go right and use these results here.

165
00:20:11,873 --> 00:20:16,100
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 of those, and this is the various votes.

166
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Last but not least, these are 100% disabled, 38 exemptions as of last Friday.

167
00:21:59,497 --> 00:22:03,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Last one, Steven, is right in front of you, the 22 E's.

168
00:22:03,505 --> 00:22:11,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the same thing, 100% bed disabled, but they live in a two family and occupy only one unit, so they get half of the full exemption.

169
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:30,590
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

170
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:35,494
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for these, we will have these 12 copies.

171
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:46,982
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have the staff make copies of each one of these and attach each ones in front of each document to show that we signed each one.

172
00:22:47,002 --> 00:22:55,708
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were just three denials.

173
00:22:56,028 --> 00:22:59,431
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't meet the asset rating components.

174
00:23:08,043 --> 00:23:25,470
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I found court income was too high, 14 Honeywell assets were too high, and same here, income was too high.

175
00:23:33,292 --> 00:23:34,693
[SPEAKER_00]: So one signature on each rent.

176
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:36,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

177
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:37,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Would those be consent?

178
00:24:37,237 --> 00:24:39,759
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

179
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:51,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Up next is the carryover that was discussed, that was added to the agenda.

180
00:24:52,908 --> 00:25:00,273
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from, again, Judy was the treasurer-collector of personal property and collectibles.

181
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:04,756
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sheet that tallies the totals from all previous fiscal years from 04 to 22.

182
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:15,062
[SPEAKER_00]: in each one of those ties to a packet that we will pass around.

183
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:17,544
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be in the order of fiscal year.

184
00:25:17,564 --> 00:25:32,258
[SPEAKER_00]: You just put them all into your density and we'll just make a stack over there.

185
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:47,315
Bye.

186
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:28,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Who does the work on these?

187
00:26:28,812 --> 00:26:31,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it your office or Treasurer's?

188
00:26:32,055 --> 00:26:36,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Treasurer collected those and then we review personal property.

189
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:41,443
[SPEAKER_00]: So, my understanding of how this happened is that it wasn't cleaned up each year.

190
00:26:42,004 --> 00:26:45,807
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there was a backlog and she was working on that backlog of cleaning out.

191
00:26:46,848 --> 00:26:49,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, collectibles are in books that will never be collected again.

192
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:52,193
[SPEAKER_00]: So, is this everything from those years?

193
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:55,245
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my understanding in the previous meeting.

194
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,448
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess there were more that were found.

195
00:26:57,488 --> 00:27:03,494
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why this was the unanticipated agenda item that was added to this meeting.

196
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:07,519
[SPEAKER_00]: She now is saying that it's leaned out through 22.

197
00:27:25,007 --> 00:27:30,313
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's more of a carryover from what I thought was going to be a one-time from June.

198
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:34,897
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same exercise which is cleaning out old personal properties.

199
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:38,021
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these are in any of the four last fiscal years.

200
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:38,981
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all from 04 to 22.

201
00:27:54,227 --> 00:28:10,672
[SPEAKER_00]: administratively as it comes off of all these, the old fours, because they weren't done in the years they were built, it'll come off in total out of the 26, so we'll get 26 full abatement for that whole figure, so.

202
00:28:10,692 --> 00:28:19,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they all for the same reason, non-business?

203
00:28:20,034 --> 00:28:21,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, non-business, like they just can't,

204
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:27,462
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot be collected and they've exhausted all evidence.

205
00:29:03,754 --> 00:29:10,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what they do for like some of these like a chain or like an internal block.

206
00:29:12,321 --> 00:29:28,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was curious and my inquiry was answered with yeah, they would have exhausted all avenues and to leave them on the books only serves to basically inflate the city thinks it's going to collect one and in fact doesn't have the ability to collect these.

207
00:29:32,162 --> 00:29:34,824
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there is still a business, like an H&R Block, is it?

208
00:29:36,385 --> 00:29:37,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.

209
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:40,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's tied to that location.

210
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:41,949
[SPEAKER_00]: I can follow up with Judy and ask.

211
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:55,399
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just curious about ones like that, where there's still an entity, the AT&T, whether you're restricted to just collecting from a location.

212
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,540
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a location, you can't.

213
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,541
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Chassis?

214
00:30:01,187 --> 00:30:02,087
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my assumption.

215
00:30:02,107 --> 00:30:05,829
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there?

216
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:09,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously, H&R Block is still in business.

217
00:30:10,671 --> 00:30:21,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not at that location, but so is that non-collectible for another reason, such as, I mean, if it's such a small amount, how do you even go about collecting the correct sum?

218
00:30:21,335 --> 00:30:25,797
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's going to pursue it.

219
00:30:25,817 --> 00:30:26,817
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't buy it or something.

220
00:30:26,877 --> 00:30:28,958
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too many months like that.

221
00:30:30,415 --> 00:30:57,120
[SPEAKER_00]: just recently, not in some personal property, but had an issue with the MBTA, where she came in and said that they owed out, it was a water bill for the MBTA over Wellington, and they got the lien put on their real estate, wasn't paid, they accumulated some $25,000 in interest, and she said, well, we can't collect it, they won't pay, so I put on a call with DLS just to see what they, so they're

222
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:02,760
[SPEAKER_00]: You can try to have them pay it, but they won't pay interest.

223
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,141
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the state doesn't pay interest.

224
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:13,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Different topic, but what she's saying is once we exhaust all avenues and can't collect it, we certainly have no other option but to write them off.

225
00:31:14,825 --> 00:31:19,847
[SPEAKER_00]: In specific with the personal property, realistically it's different.

226
00:31:20,347 --> 00:31:26,149
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they'll lean in and take it, but personal property is too hard to track now, is what I was told.

227
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:35,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So if some of them, they're all listed as not in business, which seems to apply to the vast majority, certainly at that location.

228
00:31:36,172 --> 00:31:47,480
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe some of the real unspeakable reasons are what you just explained, that all avenues have been exhausted, not that it's not owed.

229
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:56,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess not in business would make it uncollectible, as opposed to if they weren't in business at the time that it was

230
00:32:00,942 --> 00:32:04,004
[SPEAKER_01]: to them which wouldn't have been appropriate.

231
00:32:05,345 --> 00:32:10,549
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been taken care of a long time ago.

232
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:13,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not certain how much of this is just true cleanup work from 2004.

233
00:32:14,191 --> 00:32:19,135
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember, I don't even remember what I did five years ago, 20 years ago.

234
00:32:31,344 --> 00:32:43,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was on that spreadsheet that I asked you.

235
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,350
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was about 70?

236
00:33:04,091 --> 00:33:04,292
[SPEAKER_02]: 2019 Austria.

237
00:34:36,498 --> 00:34:38,999
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, got that taken care of.

238
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,902
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last piece of topic, or last topic before we go to executive session is just evaluation update.

239
00:34:49,082 --> 00:35:03,847
[SPEAKER_00]: So beginning of this week, we got our rates and rate of standards meeting with Vision, our software vendor that pulls all our data for real estate and looked at commercial.

240
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:10,386
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly flat, see cap rates ticking up a little bit in some office, for instance, ticked up slightly.

241
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:14,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Most every other space was flat.

242
00:35:15,009 --> 00:35:21,472
[SPEAKER_00]: We just recently had a hotel sale on the Riverside, just sold 27 million right across the street from here.

243
00:35:25,674 --> 00:35:28,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Residential wise, seeing

244
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,962
[SPEAKER_00]: from two to 7% increase roughly.

245
00:35:32,142 --> 00:35:33,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got the rates in today.

246
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:34,643
[SPEAKER_00]: We pushed them over.

247
00:35:34,663 --> 00:35:39,286
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in the process of working on that, but that's the update right now.

248
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:52,995
[SPEAKER_00]: As we're seeing between two and 7% moves in the residential sector and commercial looks basically flat to 1%, 1 to 2%, which is basically flat.

249
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:58,638
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be working through round one of the valuation for the recertification year.

250
00:35:59,082 --> 00:36:07,049
[SPEAKER_00]: over the next two, three weeks with myself and Mike Torello at Vision, and then Becky Boucher at the State.

251
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:15,337
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take the final review being at a restart year, and we will be putting out the values on our website.

252
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:18,980
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's October 17th, 7th through 17th.

253
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Becky, let me check on that.

254
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:23,224
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a disclosure period on the recertification years.

255
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:33,254
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the 17th through the 30th.

256
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:34,715
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have them up on the website.

257
00:36:35,496 --> 00:36:40,260
[SPEAKER_00]: This year 26 valuations for each parcel throughout the city.

258
00:36:41,381 --> 00:36:45,966
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a opportunity for the taxpayers to look at their value.

259
00:36:46,026 --> 00:36:51,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Any questions we can try to resolve it or explain it prior to committing the values.

260
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:53,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final step will be the taxpayer guarantee.

261
00:36:54,794 --> 00:36:57,096
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, we'll be working

262
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,491
[SPEAKER_00]: takes their review of it, then we'll disclose it.

263
00:37:06,952 --> 00:37:10,554
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they get notified that their values are out there to review?

264
00:37:11,635 --> 00:37:26,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Public disclosure, we will do, we'll put it on the website, and then they do a, I believe, they reach out, Steve Smurdy upstairs will do a reach out via the website, saying that the public disclosure, which is mandatory for every value here, is on the website.

265
00:37:27,504 --> 00:37:30,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they do any other types, like a robocall, their mailing or anything?

266
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:32,747
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, I looked back,

267
00:37:33,357 --> 00:37:35,818
[SPEAKER_00]: to the last revalue year that was 2021.

268
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:36,599
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't here.

269
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:41,601
[SPEAKER_00]: I was Ellen at the time and she had saved it as the same thing.

270
00:37:41,621 --> 00:37:44,303
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on the website but they just put a banner on the website.

271
00:37:45,383 --> 00:37:49,545
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look here for the link and we did have a list of each of the properties in alphabetical order.

272
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:50,886
[SPEAKER_00]: You could find your property that way.

273
00:37:54,027 --> 00:37:56,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess because we're more difficult

274
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,288
[SPEAKER_01]: a short period of time where they can do that.

275
00:38:04,608 --> 00:38:09,189
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing goes out like in a, let me see, in a tax bill?

276
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,590
[SPEAKER_01]: No tax bill, yeah.

277
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,991
[SPEAKER_00]: No tax bill goes out.

278
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:30,558
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could try to, you know, it would be an undertaking, I think, for the collector's office to put a pamphlet in the, what would it be, the second quarter bill, right, so before there, or even the October bill, I guess, to get it right before, so even the second or third quarter.

279
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:35,601
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I don't know how much of a task that would be for them.

280
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:40,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you can ask it easy enough, I don't know what it takes.

281
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:43,268
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would be the best way, right?

282
00:38:43,448 --> 00:38:43,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

283
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Sticking it in a tax bill to pre-notify people.

284
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:51,814
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know there's a lot going on in Medford, a lot of changes that affect people's wallets.

285
00:38:52,895 --> 00:38:53,816
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be one of them.

286
00:38:54,516 --> 00:38:58,440
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of concern that people aren't getting proper notice of

287
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:13,166
[SPEAKER_01]: of how things are happening, and I know we're probably going to meet whatever statutory requirements that are out for notice, but if this is... I hope with the tax billing system we have a simple way of putting notes in.

288
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:17,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'd be great if they could, and I'll certainly pass the treasure collector's sheet to do that.

289
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,628
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's not a stuffer, even if they have the ability to do a

290
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:24,139
[SPEAKER_00]: put a short memo on them?

291
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:24,820
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

292
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:26,641
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll ask if they can.

293
00:39:27,022 --> 00:39:27,983
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's easy, certainly.

294
00:39:28,003 --> 00:39:31,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's great to inform each person on their tax bill.

295
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:37,070
[SPEAKER_00]: Statutorily, the website suffices for the public disclosure.

296
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:45,076
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, I think, with outreach from upstairs, they could put out more notice that the values will be out there.

297
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:48,399
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, there's still a January period.

298
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,220
[SPEAKER_00]: That always applies every year.

299
00:39:53,673 --> 00:39:54,973
[SPEAKER_00]: but everything's finalized by then.

300
00:39:55,373 --> 00:39:57,094
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's finalized by then, yeah.

301
00:39:57,154 --> 00:40:00,014
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of like a question and answer period, isn't that right?

302
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:01,295
[SPEAKER_00]: It would fall into the abatement period.

303
00:40:01,435 --> 00:40:07,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do you get the opportunity if somebody picks out something that's an hour from now period, do you have an opportunity to do anything then?

304
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:11,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there not even enough time, you know, if you had to go out and do a remanagement or something?

305
00:40:11,457 --> 00:40:12,477
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, yeah.

306
00:40:12,737 --> 00:40:13,637
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, yeah.

307
00:40:13,657 --> 00:40:16,138
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can definitely get that taken care of.

308
00:40:16,158 --> 00:40:18,038
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the public disclosure before we

309
00:40:18,891 --> 00:40:43,239
[SPEAKER_00]: the tax rate hearing which is the final setting of the of the rates once the tax rate hearing is done then the rates are the rate is committed and the values are committed so it's basically a second check by the taxpayer if they choose but we will certainly do our due diligence in here and uh you know review each one of the changes and values to make sure they're in line with the market can i just don't get the documentation on the um

310
00:40:44,748 --> 00:40:55,695
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes of the meeting, can I make a motion then that we investigate ways to communicate this tax base through the tax bill?

311
00:40:56,275 --> 00:40:59,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

312
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,723
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to take advantage of any ways we have and work by in that way.

313
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:13,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Notify through.

314
00:41:13,748 --> 00:41:15,650
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's try to think.

315
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:18,492
[SPEAKER_00]: So the October bill, the third quarter bill would go out.

316
00:41:20,093 --> 00:41:20,514
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

317
00:41:22,375 --> 00:41:25,418
[SPEAKER_00]: The second quarter bill would go out right before that.

318
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:26,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

319
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:26,519
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

320
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:27,559
[SPEAKER_00]: Second quarter preliminary.

321
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back through the second quarter preliminary.

322
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:31,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct?

323
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:32,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

324
00:41:32,163 --> 00:41:32,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

325
00:41:37,948 --> 00:41:38,208
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

326
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:39,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

327
00:41:44,674 --> 00:41:52,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that motion is noted and I will make that inquiry with the treasure collector.

328
00:41:55,337 --> 00:41:57,418
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you refer to those values as?

329
00:41:58,158 --> 00:42:01,119
[SPEAKER_01]: What would they be posted on the website as?

330
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess you could call them preliminary FY26.

331
00:42:06,281 --> 00:42:10,282
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not committed yet, so they wouldn't be technically certified.

332
00:42:10,322 --> 00:42:10,722
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just

333
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:17,040
[SPEAKER_00]: Once every five years during the revalue, we take the second step before committing the value.

334
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,903
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a second look at your value before it is on.

335
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:22,944
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always on every year, your third quarter bill.

336
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:28,788
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically a preview, if you will, of what the value will be on your third quarter bill.

337
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:35,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's it.

338
00:42:36,192 --> 00:42:38,854
[SPEAKER_00]: I can make a motion to adjourn if there's no other questions.

339
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,881
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do executive session.

340
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:47,083
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go on to executive session if you want to do that.

341
00:42:47,383 --> 00:42:48,083
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stay on that.

342
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:53,786
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we adjourned from... Yeah, I misspoke.

343
00:42:53,986 --> 00:42:55,727
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go on to executive session.

344
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:06,112
[SPEAKER_02]: You can probably adjourn after that.

345
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:11,508
Oh.
