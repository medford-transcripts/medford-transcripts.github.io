When it says that the stormwater drain drains to a waterway, I had always thought that it meant like it drains to a pipe, and it actually goes straight into the water.

2
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:22,640
Whatever is on our roads, whatever is on our sidewalk, when there's a heavy rain, those oil spills in the street go into the water.

3
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:33,273
So low impact development is sort of a tool kit that tries to mimic what that natural state would do.

4
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:40,760
Low impact development techniques try and slow it down, try and get it into the ground instead of going into our storm drain, instead of going into the river.

5
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,463
I certainly think that there's an aesthetic value to low impact development.

6
00:00:44,764 --> 00:00:49,428
The area we're looking at right now used to be a street and now it's a nice green area

7
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:57,177
If you're going to develop a piece of land, don't cut all the trees down.

8
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,079
Try and save some of the trees.

9
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,381
Try and minimize paved surfaces.

10
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:06,246
Try and use paver blocks or porous pavement that allows the water to percolate through.
