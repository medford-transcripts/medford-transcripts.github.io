1
00:00:51,112 --> 00:00:51,192
Yeah.

2
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:19,725
Oh.

3
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:03,858
you

4
00:07:28,524 --> 00:07:31,990
I'm going to turn it back over to you, so we're going to play another level.

5
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:42,946
Thank you very much.

6
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:48,307
And the second day of the program will be presented by the High School String Ensemble.

7
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:59,010
And we'd like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for Mrs. Benjamin, who has been very supportive of the string program

8
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,515
of this past 13 years.

9
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:03,576
So, thank you.

10
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:53,606
Okay.

11
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,229
Thank you.

12
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:45,191
and and

13
00:16:55,663 --> 00:17:03,046
All right, so the next one is pretty much not from our older movie.

14
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:05,606
I'm pretty sure you guys have heard of it.

15
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:09,128
It's called We Don't Need One Mr. Church.

16
00:17:09,168 --> 00:17:13,069
It's a little laggy, but not too bad.

17
00:19:35,211 --> 00:19:37,154
Yeah.

18
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:42,000
Our next piece is going to be, I guess, another concert with the Wonderland.

19
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:29,411
Thank you.

20
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,201
All right.

21
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:04,601
All right.

22
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:42,129
and and

23
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:10,723
uh

24
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:40,370
Â© BF-WATCH TV 2021

25
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:14,253
Thank you.

26
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:40,210
When someone joins us, we will pay the bill in the mall.

27
00:25:10,915 --> 00:25:11,136
Okay.

28
00:25:48,805 --> 00:25:51,554
This piece will be the supper list.

29
00:25:51,574 --> 00:25:53,319
Do you want to show it?

30
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:05,227
So,

31
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:44,233
Yeah.

32
00:28:42,002 --> 00:28:44,764
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen,

33
00:29:07,652 --> 00:29:09,721
in front of a whole new chair for you this evening.

34
00:29:09,822 --> 00:29:11,127
So have a happy holidays.

35
00:29:39,468 --> 00:29:40,512
You ready for this?

36
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:56,611
I know.

37
00:30:56,651 --> 00:30:56,711
Yes.

38
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,232
We're going to set up now.

39
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:58,059
Thank you very much.

40
00:33:44,762 --> 00:33:45,324
Thank you.

41
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:34,152
I'm so freaking hot.

42
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:09,424
Okay.

43
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,691
They're digging deep into the well of the old time.

44
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:40,372
She's commencing the meeting, so let's say bye.

45
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,333
Good evening, everybody.

46
00:36:11,353 --> 00:36:15,098
We'll try to get the business done quickly.

47
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:16,480
We have somebody to celebrate.

48
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,485
We see a lot of new and old faces in the audience.

49
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:23,210
So we'll get through a few agenda items and then we'll celebrate with

50
00:36:24,155 --> 00:36:25,316
Member Paula Van De Kroot.

51
00:36:26,576 --> 00:36:37,882
So today is the eighth regular meeting of the Medford School Committee, Monday, December 20th, 2021, 6.30, to be held here at the Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall.

52
00:36:38,723 --> 00:36:46,707
We were just blessed to hear the Medford High School Orchestra perform a selection of holiday favorites, and we thank them for being here, that was fabulous.

53
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:50,029
We're gonna start by calling the roll, Member McLaughlin, please.

54
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:51,890
Member Graham.

55
00:36:53,578 --> 00:37:16,671
here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here,

56
00:37:23,278 --> 00:37:25,219
Do we have our student representatives on the call?

57
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:32,203
I don't believe so.

58
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:44,651
We'll move on to item three, consent agenda, approval of bills and payrolls, and approval of the regular school committee meeting minutes from 12-6-2021.

59
00:37:44,891 --> 00:37:45,711
Motion to approve.

60
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:46,132
Second.

61
00:37:46,152 --> 00:37:48,953
Motion to approve by Member Rothland, seconded by Member Rousseau.

62
00:37:49,193 --> 00:37:49,994
All those in favor?

63
00:37:50,254 --> 00:37:50,534
Aye.

64
00:37:50,814 --> 00:37:51,455
All those opposed?

65
00:37:53,026 --> 00:37:54,267
Consent agenda is approved.

66
00:37:54,947 --> 00:38:01,009
Number four, reports of subcommittees, special education subcommittee meeting minutes 12, 16, 2021.

67
00:38:01,129 --> 00:38:02,870
Member McLaughlin, motion to table.

68
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,632
Motion to table by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Rousseau.

69
00:38:07,572 --> 00:38:08,352
All those in favor?

70
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:08,832
Aye.

71
00:38:09,013 --> 00:38:09,073
Aye.

72
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:09,993
All those opposed?

73
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:11,393
Minutes are tabled.

74
00:38:12,454 --> 00:38:14,375
Number five, we have report of the superintendent.

75
00:38:15,875 --> 00:38:18,056
First up, superintendent's updates and comments.

76
00:38:18,636 --> 00:38:19,777
Dr. Maurice Edward-Vincent.

77
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:26,564
Good evening, everyone.

78
00:38:27,564 --> 00:38:34,286
First, I just want to officially thank our wonderful Strings Orchestra that performed today.

79
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:34,766
Ms.

80
00:38:34,806 --> 00:38:35,826
Sophia Ching, Ms.

81
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:37,186
Emma Baptist, Ms.

82
00:38:37,226 --> 00:38:38,546
Haley Reller was here today.

83
00:38:38,586 --> 00:38:51,809
The students did a fabulous job and it just filled this room with just beautiful music and really set a positive tone for today for us to celebrate

84
00:38:52,649 --> 00:38:56,394
and her 32 years of service.

85
00:38:56,455 --> 00:39:00,460
So I just want to thank them all for a wonderful job today.

86
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:05,907
So I have a few remarks, updates and comments on what's happening in the district.

87
00:39:07,498 --> 00:39:14,061
So it's with happy news that Nurse Avery, our Director of Health Services got married this weekend.

88
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:20,124
And so we're very happy for her, special congratulations to Nurse Avery Hines.

89
00:39:21,044 --> 00:39:33,510
And today we'll be having a COVID-19 update will be done separately from my comments today by our Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, Mr. Dave Murphy.

90
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:48,924
As I did mention to everyone last week that the winter sports season began, but I want to mention our fall athletes and recognize them who were selected as GBL All-Stars.

91
00:39:49,785 --> 00:39:55,950
So from boys cross country, we want to recognize Sam Orcutt and Chris Hart.

92
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:10,962
From girls cross-country, we want to recognize co-MVP all-stars Anna Casey and Yasmin D'Souza-Vieira, and an all-star Rikita BK.

93
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:15,982
boys and girls cross-country coaches of the year.

94
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:20,223
Lou Ruggiero and Tom Lynch, we want to recognize them.

95
00:40:21,164 --> 00:40:25,226
For football, it was Alvin McGross and Isaiah Blake.

96
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:28,887
For golf, it was Anthony Lind.

97
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:35,190
For volleyball, Kate Jocelyn, Regina Prince, and Olivia Tuss.

98
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:48,641
For boys soccer, we recognize MVP All-Star Raphael Gross, Jordan Irenkiev, Jack Medeiros, and Ryan D. Oliveira.

99
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:53,302
Boys Soccer Coach of the Year, Mike Petrides.

100
00:40:54,708 --> 00:40:59,892
Boys Soccer, Eastern Mass All-Star, Rafael Gross.

101
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,114
Girls Soccer, Emma Casey and Maria Colombo.

102
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:12,960
Girls Soccer, Eastern Mass All-Stars, Maria Colombo, Emma Casey, and Haley Duarte.

103
00:41:14,461 --> 00:41:21,006
Congratulations to all these athletes and coaches, and to all of our fall athletes and coaches for a great season.

104
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:28,756
Just a reminder that winter break begins this Thursday, December 23rd, with an early dismissal of noon.

105
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:33,437
Schools will resume on Monday, January 3rd, 2022.

106
00:41:36,302 --> 00:41:44,007
Tomorrow, December 21st, is the winter solstice that marks the official beginning of astronomical winter.

107
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:53,873
We often think of the winter solstice as an event that spans an entire calendar day, but the solstice actually lasts only a moment.

108
00:41:55,074 --> 00:42:01,818
Specifically, it's the exact moment when a hemisphere is tilted as far away from the sun as it can be.

109
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:10,374
The winter solstice holds significance across a variety of cultures, as it signals the changing of the seasons.

110
00:42:11,634 --> 00:42:19,776
Some ancient peoples even mark the solstice using huge stone structures, like Newgrange in Ireland.

111
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:26,997
Although the winter solstice means the start of winter, it also means the return of more sunlight.

112
00:42:27,697 --> 00:42:29,538
It only gets brighter from here.

113
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:37,408
I also want to share that Kwanzaa begins on December 26th and runs through January 1st.

114
00:42:39,002 --> 00:42:50,531
It's a cultural and ethnic holiday and is an annual celebration of African-American culture, culminating in a communal feast called Karani, usually held on the sixth day.

115
00:42:50,551 --> 00:43:01,159
It was created 55 years ago by Malana Karanga and is based on African harvest festival traditions held in various parts of Africa.

116
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:21,513
The theme of Kwanzaa 2021 is ensuring the well-being of the world, which encourages all of us to keep the faith, love, and respect of all people, seek and speak truths, proceed with justice, and leave a legacy worthy of our name in history.

117
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,601
Happy Kwanzaa.

118
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:29,347
Lastly, I wish all who celebrate Christmas to do so joyfully and safely.

119
00:43:29,367 --> 00:43:42,322
In the spirit of the season, so many from our schools reached into their pockets and hearts and helped those who needed a little extra help and assistance from our Mustang community.

120
00:43:44,643 --> 00:43:54,673
In the words of the now famous holiday song, Jingle Bells, that was written here in Medford, it speaks about a one-horse open sleigh.

121
00:43:54,693 --> 00:44:07,045
I look at this community as that sleigh, filled with every walk of life, eagerly helping those in need, so that all families can enjoy and laugh all the way.

122
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:08,765
through the holidays.

123
00:44:09,486 --> 00:44:15,288
At this blessed time of year, I wish all of our families a wonderful holiday season.

124
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:16,408
Thank you.

125
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,090
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

126
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,091
Up next, we have a COVID-19 update.

127
00:44:24,151 --> 00:44:27,753
Mr. David Murphy, Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations.

128
00:44:31,614 --> 00:44:33,655
Just wait for Mr. McLaughlin to turn on your microphone.

129
00:44:34,837 --> 00:44:35,137
please.

130
00:44:35,738 --> 00:44:36,279
Thank you.

131
00:44:50,617 --> 00:44:53,800
as well as our testing program being done in partnership with Tufts University.

132
00:44:54,922 --> 00:45:03,650
As has been communicated in previous messages to the committee, we have seen an uptick in positivity within our testing program.

133
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:11,759
It tracks consistent with the increase in uptick in positivity that we're seeing in the community and surrounding area.

134
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:12,359
For that reason,

135
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:26,009
The Health Services Department reaffirms and relates the message that we have been communicating consistently over the course of the past year plus, that both students and staff with symptoms are required to stay home.

136
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:34,014
And so that's a message that we'll be delivering as we head into the winter break and then upon students' return.

137
00:45:34,534 --> 00:45:35,175
We will adjust

138
00:45:35,675 --> 00:45:39,236
the testing days coming back in January.

139
00:45:39,997 --> 00:45:46,759
So schools will test on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, as they did this week as a result of the calendar and the short week.

140
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:56,883
We'll stick with the early week testing in the first couple of weeks back from January in anticipation of an uptick similar to what we saw coming out of the Thanksgiving holiday.

141
00:45:57,943 --> 00:46:05,046
In this slide, and we'll just move forward, the participation rate in the testing program continues to be strong.

142
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:12,909
I know that numbers are small, but when you see this, you can either zoom in or we can provide it in a bigger format.

143
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:18,832
But we have had very strong participation with regard to consent forms.

144
00:46:18,892 --> 00:46:24,314
And as we've talked about in this forum before, our actual participation rates, which you can see more clearly on the next slide,

145
00:46:25,194 --> 00:46:32,398
That's a percentage of students who both have turned in consent forms to participate in the testing program and then who are actually participating.

146
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:37,661
So we're hitting a rate of about 70% of students that are testing at least weekly.

147
00:46:37,681 --> 00:46:44,646
There is some slack as we've discussed that before, and this chart is meant to break down where that essentially is.

148
00:46:44,706 --> 00:46:48,668
So we have about 12% of our student population who have not yet

149
00:46:49,428 --> 00:47:11,402
volunteer to have families volunteer to participate in the testing program and we'll be continuing to push that messaging when we come back in the new year with the caveat that we'll also be emphasizing what we're going to talk about now as we move forward, that we will be holding additional vaccination clinics in partnership with the Board of Health.

150
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:22,727
This is just in response to some questions that we've had from the committee and community members with regard to what is the extent to which students are currently being forced out of school to either isolate or quarantine.

151
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,808
And you can see the asterisk there.

152
00:47:25,288 --> 00:47:36,853
Well, this is still sort of coming out of a post-Thanksgiving uptick in quarantine that you can see, particularly at the McGlynn Middle School, you can see a number that's particularly high in the Mississippi also.

153
00:47:37,773 --> 00:47:41,215
That number, though, of 39 students, that's the number as of today.

154
00:47:41,235 --> 00:47:52,581
That number will reduce to under 10 students in quarantine tomorrow, with the caveat that we tested that move in today, meaning it may just go back up, obviously.

155
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:59,485
But that is all reflective of this uptick that we've seen and the need to continue our level of vigilance.

156
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:06,129
And then just in that last slide, you can see, almost the last slide, I apologize, that's our vaccination rates.

157
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:27,551
You can see in these numbers, I expect we'll be having a more detailed conversation at our first meeting in January, but we are generally encouraged by our vaccination rates amongst staff and amongst our high school population who, of course, have had a longer period of time to get vaccinated.

158
00:48:27,591 --> 00:48:30,412
That's in the 12 to 18 population primarily.

159
00:48:31,432 --> 00:48:34,694
Our five to 11-year-old population, the numbers are low.

160
00:48:35,614 --> 00:48:45,959
I would say that there is some as yet unidentified number of students who are not included in those five to 11-year-old numbers because they have not yet received their second shot.

161
00:48:46,399 --> 00:48:49,300
And so partially vaccinated would not be reflected in this table.

162
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:55,123
So I expect that when we share the information in January, certainly by mid-January, you'll see an uptick.

163
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:01,625
We're at over 90% at each of our school buildings, some considerably higher than that.

164
00:49:01,925 --> 00:49:09,748
We will be, as I said, pushing the vaccination clinics that we'll be running in coordination with the city's Board of Health in January.

165
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:18,411
And it's our hope that, I can talk a little bit about that if you have questions, but our hope is that we'll see the needle move in a favorable direction from a vaccination perspective.

166
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:21,212
So now on the final slide, I promise I know there's a lot

167
00:49:22,452 --> 00:49:25,714
to do tonight and this is probably not the highlight of the meeting event for anybody.

168
00:49:25,734 --> 00:49:36,701
Our vaccination clinics, we are planning vaccination clinics in conjunction with the Board of Health for every Wednesday and we hope to start on January 5th.

169
00:49:37,101 --> 00:49:40,543
So these will be for district staff and students.

170
00:49:41,704 --> 00:49:44,585
We will run the clinic most likely at Medford High School.

171
00:49:45,266 --> 00:49:47,467
It will start at least at first as an

172
00:49:47,827 --> 00:49:48,768
after school program.

173
00:49:49,588 --> 00:50:00,113
And we will be doing phone banking in addition to the clinics to try to encourage families to bring their students, particularly the five to 11 year old population where we know we have some gaps that we need to fill there.

174
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:16,262
So we'll have a more formal announcement coming over the course of the coming days and probably the essential focal of our end of the calendar year messaging that you'll receive from the superintendent, but we'll be seeing a lot of work to complete our vaccination cycles.

175
00:50:16,962 --> 00:50:21,006
starting on January and running every Wednesday for the foreseeable future.

176
00:50:22,168 --> 00:50:23,429
With that, I'm happy to take your questions.

177
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:27,994
Mayor, Member Vendicott, I was asked to read this letter.

178
00:50:28,774 --> 00:50:36,342
Hello, this is from a citizen, Rebecca Gutwin, 47 Morrison Street, from the Roberts Elementary School as your parent.

179
00:50:37,143 --> 00:50:51,831
With rising COVID cases in our city and our schools, I am becoming increasingly concerned that all notices about COVID protocol and vaccination clinics are primarily being sent out via email and Facebook, further limiting access.

180
00:50:52,151 --> 00:50:55,312
The notices are only in English and with no translation available.

181
00:50:56,013 --> 00:51:00,575
All notices should be going home with students on paper and need to be translated.

182
00:51:00,895 --> 00:51:04,017
We aren't even trying to have effective outreach and it is clearly showing

183
00:51:04,477 --> 00:51:05,658
in our case rate numbers.

184
00:51:06,259 --> 00:51:14,746
Most recently, our amazing nurses at Roberts Elementary School sent out instructions on how to submit vaccine cards from our recently vaccinated students.

185
00:51:15,246 --> 00:51:18,068
The email was very informative, but was only in English.

186
00:51:18,429 --> 00:51:23,073
It should have been sent home in backpacks along with information about this weekend's vaccine clinic.

187
00:51:23,753 --> 00:51:27,757
Ideally, we would be contacting patient parents by email, phone and mail.

188
00:51:28,257 --> 00:51:33,502
We are all overwhelmed right now, but effective outreach is the key to lowering our case rates and workload.

189
00:51:33,963 --> 00:51:35,945
Mr. Murphy, could you please address this?

190
00:51:36,245 --> 00:51:37,406
Sure.

191
00:51:37,626 --> 00:51:40,469
The first thing I would say is that I think

192
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:51,635
Whenever we're looking at communication issues, we have to be mindful that continuous improvement is our obligation and we want to improve our communication strategies in whatever way we can.

193
00:51:51,995 --> 00:51:58,359
I do think that some of the underlying facts in that particular message may not be completely accurate.

194
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:06,883
We do provide translations to every communication that comes out from the central office and generally from the schools as well, but that's certainly something that we'll follow up on.

195
00:52:07,564 --> 00:52:13,473
and reiterate to each of our school communities that all messaging needs to be in all appropriate languages.

196
00:52:14,053 --> 00:52:22,646
With regard to the backpack versus email and social media communications, we certainly do utilize all different methods.

197
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:36,498
I think that when we have particularly important and out of the ordinary messaging, I think I would agree with the constituent that we want to use all of those different platforms, including the tried and true method of backpack delivery.

198
00:52:37,819 --> 00:52:47,708
Because we put such an emphasis on communication, it's inevitable that a portion of it will be electronic because we just don't have the capacity to put everything in a backpack.

199
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:50,090
And also, I think from a strategic perspective,

200
00:52:50,830 --> 00:53:03,934
It's it's advantageous to only do that, particularly out of the ordinary messages in the back because it tends to send out and we don't want to get to a place where the backpack is essentially a spam folder that we're dumping stuff into day in and day out.

201
00:53:03,954 --> 00:53:05,735
But I think the message is well taken.

202
00:53:05,755 --> 00:53:07,775
I'd ask that be forwarded to the administration.

203
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:11,056
We'll look through and see if there's any other particular pieces we can respond to.

204
00:53:11,836 --> 00:53:12,177
Thank you.

205
00:53:12,577 --> 00:53:12,897
Thank you.

206
00:53:13,997 --> 00:53:14,297
Thank you.

207
00:53:14,777 --> 00:53:16,678
Thank you, Mr. Thank you very much.

208
00:53:20,725 --> 00:53:36,027
Are we considering having school day oriented vaccination clinics, particularly at the younger levels where kids are not able to navigate themselves around wherever it is that they need to go?

209
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:38,109
Yes.

210
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:44,893
The only reason I said that we're going to start off at the after school portion for January 5th is just due to staffing.

211
00:53:45,294 --> 00:53:48,936
We want to have our student nurse roster replenished.

212
00:53:50,077 --> 00:53:53,239
I'm not sure that's the exact right word, but we want to make sure that we have a full complement of

213
00:53:53,739 --> 00:54:01,765
of student nurses on staff so that we're not diverting our health services team away from other responsibilities they need to attend to.

214
00:54:02,085 --> 00:54:07,389
But once we're in a position from a staffing perspective, I would anticipate that we will look at potential school day vaccinations.

215
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:08,570
Okay, thank you.

216
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:09,231
Perfect, thank you.

217
00:54:13,618 --> 00:54:13,898
Thank you.

218
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:18,920
Next up, we have update on kindergarten enrollment, assistant superintendent of elementary education, Ms.

219
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:19,820
Suzanne Guzzi.

220
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,741
Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

221
00:54:23,662 --> 00:54:28,263
This is going to be a brief update just about our rising kindergarten enrollment numbers.

222
00:54:28,823 --> 00:54:38,887
As of December 17th, Metro Public Schools has welcomed 23 new kindergarten students, and there's still more in the queue in the Parent Information Center.

223
00:54:39,487 --> 00:54:42,531
So essentially that's the equivalent of another kindergarten classroom.

224
00:54:42,551 --> 00:54:50,480
The majority of these students are focused around the McGlynn Elementary School, in which those classrooms are at full capacity right now.

225
00:54:50,961 --> 00:54:55,706
So moving forward, we will be reassigning some students to other available schools.

226
00:54:56,547 --> 00:55:11,207
This unexpected increase at the kindergarten grade level may require us to create additional first grade classrooms as we're looking ahead to next year, which was on our radar anyway, but just is increasingly so.

227
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:22,001
In the table below in the report that you have, it just breaks down the enrollment as to what the kindergarten numbers were in September and where they are now per each school.

228
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:28,709
You can see that right now we have 357 current kindergarten students in Method Public Schools.

229
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:46,082
Of that number, 105 of those students, when the parents were filling out the transition forms, did indicate that a language other than English was spoken at home, and they were evaluated, and 58 of those students are now receiving English language services.

230
00:55:47,763 --> 00:55:49,865
they are dispersed throughout the district.

231
00:55:50,206 --> 00:55:59,416
We warmly welcome our new students to the Metro Public Schools and look forward to a strong educational foundation for our students at the youngest levels.

232
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:14,907
I do think it's important to note that we're also, this is the time of year that we're looking to welcome next year's Medford Public School students and kindergarten registration will officially open Monday, January 10th.

233
00:56:15,727 --> 00:56:19,089
We do have three dates for our registration.

234
00:56:20,229 --> 00:56:24,052
informational session, our Bridges to Kindergarten presentations.

235
00:56:24,592 --> 00:56:28,294
The first two will be virtual in Zoom capacity.

236
00:56:29,275 --> 00:56:35,939
One will be on January 13th at 630, and the other will be February 8th at 630.

237
00:56:36,419 --> 00:56:41,102
And then the March 9th session will be in person up at Medford High School.

238
00:56:46,543 --> 00:56:48,104
And I think that pretty much covers it.

239
00:56:48,144 --> 00:56:50,024
If you have any questions, yes.

240
00:56:53,025 --> 00:56:54,545
Member McLaughlin and member Russo.

241
00:56:55,466 --> 00:56:55,886
Thank you.

242
00:56:55,986 --> 00:56:57,246
Thank you for the update.

243
00:56:58,026 --> 00:56:58,186
Ms.

244
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:06,769
Glucy, just a couple of questions, both on the breakdown of the schools and the asterisk at the bottom of the kindergarten enrollment breakdown.

245
00:57:07,409 --> 00:57:12,090
So the asterisk says an additional 11 kindergarten students are assigned to specialized classroom

246
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:18,639
classrooms district-wide based on their IEP needs, which looks like it changes the number from 357 to 368.

247
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:29,025
So I'm wondering, are they not included in the total of the September or December enrollment in each of the schools?

248
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:31,307
Like why are they segregated out in this section?

249
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:42,648
So for two of our schools, they are separated just the way that our online system, our school brain system has the students enrolled at the Roberts and the McGlynn.

250
00:57:43,389 --> 00:57:49,092
They're not, that's just the way their enrollment is per their classroom for the connections and the access programs.

251
00:57:50,522 --> 00:57:53,887
So they're not figured in the total because of the school grades populate.

252
00:57:54,368 --> 00:58:03,942
So the Roberts has, I believe, five more students to the number that's here, and the McGlynn, I believe, has two.

253
00:58:03,982 --> 00:58:04,183
Okay.

254
00:58:06,354 --> 00:58:07,135
And then, thank you.

255
00:58:07,295 --> 00:58:18,883
And then in the breakdown of the schools that has the numbers per classroom breakdown, that just seems different than what you're saying around the five and the two.

256
00:58:19,003 --> 00:58:23,927
And so I'm wondering where those lie in the breakdown of the school.

257
00:58:24,007 --> 00:58:29,991
So like, for example, in the Brooks School, isn't there a language-based classroom at grade five?

258
00:58:30,111 --> 00:58:32,373
Yes, currently there are no kindergarten students enrolled.

259
00:58:33,615 --> 00:58:37,322
Right, so they're not on that number, but I mean on this on this on this breakdown.

260
00:58:37,342 --> 00:58:38,464
Do you have this right?

261
00:58:38,484 --> 00:58:39,025
Yes, yes.

262
00:58:39,426 --> 00:58:44,296
So on the breakdown for that sheet for grade five, is there a language based classroom included in this grade five?

263
00:58:46,325 --> 00:58:53,290
Yes, but I specifically asked Kim Miles to run this report just for the kindergarten numbers.

264
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:56,972
So I also wasn't specific or detailed in what I was asking her.

265
00:58:56,992 --> 00:59:02,096
Like I didn't ask for the district wide specific breakdown, including all programs.

266
00:59:02,136 --> 00:59:03,817
I just wanted her to focus on the kindergarten.

267
00:59:04,297 --> 00:59:08,220
I know you have all of the classrooms here, but yeah, I can run another one.

268
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,001
Yeah, that would be very helpful.

269
00:59:10,041 --> 00:59:10,722
Thank you, please.

270
00:59:10,742 --> 00:59:13,565
Because it doesn't, yeah, it wasn't inclusive of everybody.

271
00:59:13,585 --> 00:59:17,569
So I want to make sure that everyone's included on this breakdown for the classroom so that we can better understand.

272
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:26,639
And then also, I know in the, in the NISITUC, you have the programmatic elements or somebody has the programmatic elements in parenthetical.

273
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,263
I'm assuming NC for that four is newcomer.

274
00:59:30,976 --> 00:59:31,196
Yes.

275
00:59:31,336 --> 00:59:31,677
Okay.

276
00:59:32,297 --> 00:59:34,078
TLP is Therapeutic Learning Program.

277
00:59:34,158 --> 00:59:34,379
Yes.

278
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,662
And on the Roberts, the Connections Program, right?

279
00:59:39,002 --> 00:59:39,242
Yes.

280
00:59:39,522 --> 00:59:46,528
And so at either the Brooks or the McGlynn, if you're going to include programmatic elements, they should also be at the Brooks or the McGlynn, right?

281
00:59:46,568 --> 00:59:49,350
So there's access at the... Yes.

282
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:49,750
Yeah.

283
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:50,431
Yes.

284
00:59:50,591 --> 00:59:52,852
Just to be clear, the reason that the Brooks is that

285
00:59:53,915 --> 00:59:59,660
all students are in the homerooms, so technically the language-based teachers.

286
01:00:01,702 --> 01:00:08,207
Under school brains, I would just have her run something different because they're not listed, all students are dispersed into homerooms.

287
01:00:08,387 --> 01:00:10,189
That's why they're not populated.

288
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:15,013
But I think it sort of doesn't tell us all the data, so if you don't mind including them all, that'd be great.

289
01:00:15,053 --> 01:00:19,397
And then any other programmatic elements that are broken out for the other schools, if you could just speak, if you wouldn't mind.

290
01:00:19,517 --> 01:00:19,877
Thank you.

291
01:00:22,964 --> 01:00:40,156
I just wanted to say in terms of this report that was presented because there were different numbers of students in the different buildings that I had intentionally not wanted to call out whether one building had two additional students or five.

292
01:00:40,276 --> 01:00:44,419
So that's why I tried to have it just as one larger number.

293
01:00:44,839 --> 01:00:46,880
But if you want it specifically called out,

294
01:00:49,035 --> 01:00:59,279
by programs that is available, but I was the one who did not want the specific numbers for every single building because you would know which program it was.

295
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:00,639
Thank you.

296
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:07,602
There are some on the other schools though that are one and two superintendents, so that's what I'm just asking, just that way if we can be

297
01:01:08,442 --> 01:01:20,600
However you guys want to do it if it's just consistent across the schools that's what would be most helpful for me to see and that we're obviously that we're being inclusive and then I didn't see that so the only EL breakdown is the newcomer for fourth grade from Miss attack right.

298
01:01:21,886 --> 01:01:24,348
but there's gonna be other, yeah.

299
01:01:24,668 --> 01:01:25,989
You can see that they're listed there.

300
01:01:26,029 --> 01:01:33,854
The only one that's not is the fifth grade classroom, which is actually at the McGlynn, not at the Missituck.

301
01:01:34,475 --> 01:01:35,956
And that's listed by the teacher's name.

302
01:01:36,056 --> 01:01:38,538
So when I run the next report, I'll make sure that I have the.

303
01:01:40,398 --> 01:01:42,779
just helps give a picture of across this district.

304
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:43,799
Thank you so much.

305
01:01:43,859 --> 01:01:44,680
Thank you so much.

306
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:45,740
Member Rousseau.

307
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:46,700
Thank you.

308
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:54,723
I noticed that for the incoming kindergartners where we are at capacity, we're dispersing them to the other schools.

309
01:01:57,104 --> 01:02:00,268
What's the plan or thinking for those students for next year?

310
01:02:00,288 --> 01:02:05,415
Will they have to remain away from their zoned school communities?

311
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:10,001
Will they be offered or will they be required to go back to the other school?

312
01:02:11,707 --> 01:02:16,611
I believe the plan is absolutely to offer them to return to their neighborhood schools.

313
01:02:16,631 --> 01:02:26,980
I think the discussion in terms of if they would like to remain at the school in which they were assigned is something that we're still discussing as central administration, just along the lines of

314
01:02:29,722 --> 01:02:35,206
siblings, transportation, we want to make sure that it's a thoughtful, meaningful decision.

315
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:36,848
So it won't be a one size fits all.

316
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:37,528
Correct.

317
01:02:37,608 --> 01:02:38,029
That's great.

318
01:02:38,229 --> 01:02:41,952
And I mean, the sibling thing, I assume, of course, you'd handle that.

319
01:02:41,992 --> 01:02:46,975
I'm just particularly worried about transportation because it's really a suffer run, right?

320
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:47,216
Yes.

321
01:02:48,617 --> 01:02:49,557
So, okay.

322
01:02:49,638 --> 01:02:49,958
Thank you.

323
01:02:49,998 --> 01:02:50,798
Glad you're thinking about it.

324
01:02:51,579 --> 01:02:51,879
Thank you.

325
01:02:53,501 --> 01:02:54,601
Just one question from the chair.

326
01:02:54,641 --> 01:02:55,242
I'll be brief.

327
01:02:55,282 --> 01:02:56,523
I know we have somebody to honor, but

328
01:02:57,903 --> 01:03:08,796
With the 23 new students, they're calling different days throughout the last two months, and I'm assuming they all weren't in queue trying to be placed.

329
01:03:08,876 --> 01:03:14,042
About how long does it take to place a child in kindergarten once a parent calls and said they've moved here?

330
01:03:14,714 --> 01:03:17,455
It varies depending on the applicant.

331
01:03:17,595 --> 01:03:20,917
So they have to be medically cleared.

332
01:03:21,117 --> 01:03:29,541
Some students, many of these families that are coming in are also indicating on the transition forms that English is not the language spoken at home.

333
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:35,364
So that requires Mr. Teixeira's staff to do an assessment, a language assessment.

334
01:03:36,244 --> 01:03:43,208
If the child is also coming in with any sort of special education services or any health related issues, it depends on how long.

335
01:03:43,668 --> 01:03:51,191
It also depends on if the parent is current and up with all of the requirements in terms of documentation.

336
01:03:51,891 --> 01:03:57,393
So it could be as quick as just a few days or as long as a week or two.

337
01:03:58,714 --> 01:03:59,214
Member Russo.

338
01:03:59,734 --> 01:04:00,094
Thank you.

339
01:04:00,394 --> 01:04:05,476
And I also meant to ask, could each of these documents that were left with us please be emailed to us?

340
01:04:06,076 --> 01:04:06,317
Yes.

341
01:04:06,617 --> 01:04:06,977
Thank you.

342
01:04:08,737 --> 01:04:09,158
Thank you, Ms.

343
01:04:09,198 --> 01:04:09,518
Clusey.

344
01:04:09,598 --> 01:04:10,158
Thank you very much.

345
01:04:14,658 --> 01:04:18,084
We have special recognition of school committee member, Ms.

346
01:04:18,144 --> 01:04:22,853
Paulette van de Kloot, retiring after 32 years of service to the Medford Public Schools.

347
01:04:22,873 --> 01:04:26,119
I'd like to invite up Dr. Maurice-Edward Vincent to start us off.

348
01:04:30,768 --> 01:04:31,609
Good evening again.

349
01:04:31,629 --> 01:04:36,412
This is a wonderful, this is the wonderful report that I was looking forward to.

350
01:04:37,212 --> 01:04:39,054
So let me start with that.

351
01:04:39,854 --> 01:04:43,857
We have a lot of wonderful invited guests who are here to celebrate you, Ms.

352
01:04:43,897 --> 01:04:44,998
Paulette Vanderclute.

353
01:04:45,538 --> 01:04:47,099
We do give a root for Ms.

354
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:49,241
Vanderclute.

355
01:04:49,981 --> 01:04:51,702
So let me start this journey.

356
01:04:52,463 --> 01:04:54,965
Thank you for coming to join us today, everyone.

357
01:04:54,985 --> 01:04:56,226
32 years.

358
01:04:56,266 --> 01:04:56,866
For 32 years,

359
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:12,240
The superintendent of the Medford Public Schools has enjoyed the counsel, support, and supervision of someone who has come to embody public service in this community.

360
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:29,634
For 32 years, the teachers and staff of the Medford Public Schools have enjoyed the presence, enthusiasm, and loyalty of someone who afforded this city her time, energy, and leadership.

361
01:05:32,037 --> 01:05:33,277
for 32 years.

362
01:05:34,478 --> 01:05:47,662
The parents and caregivers of Medford's children and young adults have had a voice in the governance of their children's school system because of someone who has continually put the needs of her community before her own.

363
01:05:50,353 --> 01:06:04,940
For 32 years, the residents of Medford have enjoyed access to their city school system through a representative who has worked to make this school system liable of the great community we serve.

364
01:06:07,434 --> 01:06:25,313
For 32 years, the students of the Medford Public Schools have benefited from an elected official whose sole focus has been working to build a school system that will position them for success, achievement, and fulfilling lives.

365
01:06:26,995 --> 01:06:41,943
And for the last four years, as the city superintendent of schools, I have enjoyed the friendship, guidance, and mentorship of the person whose service we honor tonight, Mrs. Paulette Vander Kloop.

366
01:06:44,164 --> 01:06:46,465
Paulette here is from Illinois, Illinois.

367
01:06:47,406 --> 01:06:51,508
Coming here to study at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

368
01:06:53,142 --> 01:07:00,767
41 years ago, she married Bob Vandercroft, also a Medford transplant.

369
01:07:02,108 --> 01:07:09,392
And together they raised three daughters, Katie, Megan, and Liz, each of whom are Mustang alumni.

370
01:07:10,013 --> 01:07:17,938
Starting with her work with the Medford-Holman School Association, Paulette's support for the district has been steadfast.

371
01:07:19,332 --> 01:07:37,302
Paulette was elected 32 years ago, the day after giving birth to her youngest daughter, with a famous slogan of, give a hoot, vote for Vanderkoop, which resonated with this community for the next three decades.

372
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:46,288
She personified that slogan by supporting every Mustang sport, activity, and club the district had to offer.

373
01:07:47,942 --> 01:07:53,105
Paulette's vision for the school system was one that served the whole child and every child.

374
01:07:54,025 --> 01:08:06,332
Through her advocacy of the arts, early education programs, and so much else, we are a district that is much closer to that vision than we would have been without her leadership and service.

375
01:08:07,572 --> 01:08:09,974
And so tonight, we say thank you.

376
01:08:12,238 --> 01:08:29,231
We know we could not fit in one room all the people who want to say thank you, but the following guests are with us both to say thank you and as representatives of everyone else who Paulette has worked with in all of the good work they have done together.

377
01:08:29,251 --> 01:08:29,291
So,

378
01:08:33,767 --> 01:08:36,268
Former superintendents of schools.

379
01:08:36,328 --> 01:08:40,030
We have former superintendent of schools, Dr. Phil DeVoe.

380
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:44,451
Former superintendent of schools, Roy Belson.

381
01:08:45,432 --> 01:08:49,394
Former assistant superintendent of schools, Beverly Nelson.

382
01:08:50,314 --> 01:08:54,276
Former assistant superintendent of schools, Diane Caldwell.

383
01:08:57,097 --> 01:08:59,918
Former McGill School principal, James Devaney.

384
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:08,495
I would like to ask Mr. Roy-Belson, who has a few words to share, to please come forward at this time.

385
01:09:20,325 --> 01:09:28,912
Mayor Romero-Kern, honorable members of the school committee, school committee member-elect, distinguished colleagues, people of former school committee members,

386
01:09:30,066 --> 01:09:42,114
colleagues in administration and education, executive director for the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, Glenn Kutcher, all of us here tonight to pay tribute to our friend and colleague, Paula Vanderkoop.

387
01:09:43,515 --> 01:09:51,480
I have the privilege and pleasure of working with Paula Vanderkoop for 28 years, over 32 years as a member of the Medford School Committee.

388
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:59,165
She clearly ranks among the very best school committee members in my experience, as an educator, both within and beyond Medford.

389
01:10:00,424 --> 01:10:07,348
Paulette has been a steady, resourceful, insightful, and strategic asset to our public schools and community.

390
01:10:08,328 --> 01:10:16,672
Most importantly, she has been a compassionate and caring spokesperson for students, parents, teachers, administrators, and staff.

391
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:26,418
Her energy, voice, and actions have contributed and enabled significant progress and programs to become a reality in our Medford schools and community.

392
01:10:27,358 --> 01:10:30,680
Her integrity has been a moral compass throughout her service.

393
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:37,405
I'm personally grateful for both her critical feedback and support during my time as superintendent of schools.

394
01:10:38,265 --> 01:10:40,907
Paulette was never a lover's stamp.

395
01:10:41,507 --> 01:10:42,408
I can assure you of that.

396
01:10:43,388 --> 01:10:47,891
But rather a partner in seeking and promoting constructive goals and achievements.

397
01:10:48,712 --> 01:10:56,317
She had the attitude and ability to get her concerns and ideas expressed without rancor and over-the-top political theatrics.

398
01:10:57,298 --> 01:11:04,785
certainly a character trait and methodology that merits emulation in today's hyper-verbalized and divisive public discourse.

399
01:11:06,467 --> 01:11:10,591
Please permit me to cite some specifics regarding Powhatan's contributions.

400
01:11:11,872 --> 01:11:13,574
This will not be a total listing show.

401
01:11:13,614 --> 01:11:15,015
We'd be here all night.

402
01:11:15,055 --> 01:11:17,357
This school committee tends to run late meetings.

403
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:24,926
Paulette was the first president of the Citywide Home and School Association.

404
01:11:25,767 --> 01:11:34,574
Getting all the small schools to work together in the 80s was no small task or achievement, because everybody saw themselves as an independent operation.

405
01:11:35,615 --> 01:11:40,719
She served on the statewide MISC board and is recognized as a lifetime member.

406
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:48,465
She and Anne Marie Cremio was here this evening, were the only two Medford School Committee members to serve on the statewide governing board.

407
01:11:49,730 --> 01:12:04,717
She was a prominent supporter of early childhood education, which resulted in the formation of the Medford Family Network, the Medford Family Resource Coalition, preschool programs, citywide all-day kindergarten, and before and after school programming.

408
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:10,940
She served on the Building the Future Committee that planned the construction of our six K-8 schools.

409
01:12:11,821 --> 01:12:15,703
She was a prominent supporter of our MSBA Science Lab reconstruction,

410
01:12:16,811 --> 01:12:20,075
There are many other capital improvements that are fueled by Paulette's support.

411
01:12:20,596 --> 01:12:22,078
Far too many to name right now.

412
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:34,032
The expansion of our vocational school program was strongly supported by Paulette, as we paid back from the expensive tuition out in honor to Minuteman and launched multiple state-of-the-art offerings here at home.

413
01:12:35,337 --> 01:12:42,606
During several severe budget crunches, Paulette fought hard to maintain art, music, foreign language programs.

414
01:12:43,307 --> 01:12:53,200
She is an original supporter of the whole child approach to public education, which is clearly a precursor to expanded social and emotional services for children, youth, and families.

415
01:12:54,415 --> 01:13:02,278
Innovative programs like the Center for Civic and Social Responsibility, CCSI, and Global Scholars were high on her priority list.

416
01:13:02,958 --> 01:13:09,341
As the frequent chairperson of the Curriculum Subcommittee, she always pushed to ensure there were upgrades to our academic programs.

417
01:13:10,409 --> 01:13:13,491
The high school was reaccredited three times during their terms of office.

418
01:13:14,392 --> 01:13:23,758
Numerous state-coordinated program reviews were conducted, and PILOT was always an asset to the process and supported improvements necessary to achieve good reports.

419
01:13:24,932 --> 01:13:32,599
Balancing the school budget was frequently a challenge, and Paulette understood what had to be done and how to creatively generate resources.

420
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:42,289
She was always a practical voice as we negotiated multiple collective bargaining agreements and avoided unnecessary, disruptive conflicts with our various unions.

421
01:13:43,369 --> 01:13:47,255
No school community attended more student programs and concerts than Pirate.

422
01:13:47,936 --> 01:13:51,160
She often hopped from program to program on the same night to show support.

423
01:13:51,881 --> 01:13:57,609
And to my recollection, Pirate made every myth and mime in Thanksgiving Day, even in the bitterest of cold weather.

424
01:13:59,011 --> 01:13:59,813
It was cold out there.

425
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:05,519
Perhaps her most admirable quality was that she always supported the underdog.

426
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:09,422
She always fought hard for students and families that needed something extra.

427
01:14:10,142 --> 01:14:12,424
She believed that education must be inclusive.

428
01:14:13,144 --> 01:14:16,406
She strongly supported social justice, equity, and opportunity.

429
01:14:17,107 --> 01:14:21,870
She firmly believed it is possible to be both excellent and equitable at the same time.

430
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:27,193
She always displayed moral courage, even when the issues were being hotly contested.

431
01:14:27,954 --> 01:14:29,595
She has always been at her very best.

432
01:14:30,926 --> 01:14:44,059
Outside of her role as a school committee member, Paulette has done many charitable projects, toys for underprivileged kids, support for elderly and informed, and surrogate parenting for young adults in need.

433
01:14:45,865 --> 01:14:49,206
There is much more, but I think all of you get the idea.

434
01:14:50,047 --> 01:14:55,029
Paulette has not only been a terrific school committee member, but she's an exemplary human being.

435
01:14:55,969 --> 01:15:10,275
Paulette did all of this and more by raising a terrific family, here tonight, with her husband Bob, running a toy store business, acquiring a master's degree in counseling, running the junior volunteer program at Winchester Hospital.

436
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:13,431
Paulette, you deserve our praise and respect.

437
01:15:14,191 --> 01:15:15,551
You did it the old-fashioned way.

438
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:16,692
You earned it.

439
01:15:17,792 --> 01:15:19,172
All the best to you and your family.

440
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:21,593
You will definitely be a hard act to follow.

441
01:15:22,834 --> 01:15:29,656
Paulette, I'm sure the school committee and the community will miss your regular service, but I'm sure you'll continue to serve.

442
01:15:29,676 --> 01:15:35,158
I want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas, happy holidays, and a very prosperous new year.

443
01:15:35,438 --> 01:15:36,258
Thank you for listening.

444
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:49,361
Thank you.

445
01:15:49,502 --> 01:15:50,682
Thank you, Mr. Nelson.

446
01:15:50,703 --> 01:15:57,868
I would like to now recognize some of our former school committee members who are here in the audience with us today.

447
01:15:58,869 --> 01:16:15,882
We have Patty Brady, Jack Buckley, former Build in the Future project manager, Emily Cuno, Ellen DiBenedetto, Fred Lasky, who is the current director of Massachusetts Water Resource Authority,

448
01:16:18,075 --> 01:16:18,775
Ed Nolan.

449
01:16:20,256 --> 01:16:25,339
We have Beth Fuller, also here as a former school committee member.

450
01:16:26,259 --> 01:16:31,582
And I would like to ask Beth Fuller to please come forward to share a few words with us.

451
01:16:31,602 --> 01:16:45,330
I don't, I don't.

452
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,411
I'm holding on to it just in case.

453
01:16:51,858 --> 01:17:02,843
So this is my poet, which has been in my yard, not all year long, but just during the election season, and then also held at polling places for many years.

454
01:17:03,523 --> 01:17:05,484
I first met Paulette probably around 1989.

455
01:17:07,385 --> 01:17:24,218
We were standing outside the Dame School at pickup time, and I probably stood out because I had a backpack with a child in it, a double stroller with two grandchildren, and then probably one or two others moving on, because I was a daycare provider at the time.

456
01:17:25,778 --> 01:17:33,141
And you said to me, gee, you don't really want to get involved in the things that are going on around the city.

457
01:17:33,161 --> 01:17:38,142
And no, maybe you might want to run for school committee.

458
01:17:38,603 --> 01:17:39,923
Well, that was gobsmacking.

459
01:17:41,384 --> 01:17:42,884
And a few years later, I did.

460
01:17:43,324 --> 01:17:44,965
And we served together for six years.

461
01:17:46,424 --> 01:17:54,191
At the time that we started on school committee, there were 11 elementary schools, three middle schools, and three high schools.

462
01:17:54,671 --> 01:18:01,657
Most principals had two schools under their care, and inevitably, when things went wrong,

463
01:18:02,578 --> 01:18:04,159
They weren't at that school.

464
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:08,302
Instead, it was the school secretaries who held things together.

465
01:18:08,322 --> 01:18:18,350
And one of the very important lessons we learned was that you had to make friends with the school secretaries and the custodians, because they knew everything.

466
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:22,813
And they were very discreet, but they were very good buddies.

467
01:18:25,536 --> 01:18:28,097
At that time, there were no cell phones.

468
01:18:28,758 --> 01:18:39,384
So, our families quickly learned that if you picked up the phone, you had to take a message, because otherwise, we would never know who called.

469
01:18:40,464 --> 01:18:44,747
Generally speaking, the families left the phone alone and just walked away from it.

470
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:47,909
And there were no computers, no laptops.

471
01:18:48,609 --> 01:18:50,530
There was no social media, no Google.

472
01:18:51,051 --> 01:19:02,618
So we kind of did the best we could to get people together to meetings with handouts, with phone calls, just nabbing people outside school buildings.

473
01:19:06,094 --> 01:19:09,662
The nice thing was that when you went on vacation, you left it at behind.

474
01:19:10,123 --> 01:19:11,326
It didn't have to come with you.

475
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:12,308
It was very nice.

476
01:19:15,557 --> 01:19:26,885
you, Paulette, helped to support the kindergarten aides because Medford had one of the very few extended day programs for kindergarten students at that time that was free.

477
01:19:26,985 --> 01:19:28,346
There was no charge for that.

478
01:19:29,367 --> 01:19:32,809
All of the other districts around us charged for extended day.

479
01:19:33,309 --> 01:19:34,250
Medford did not.

480
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:44,037
The kindergarten aides were critical to making sure that the kindergarten teacher was able to make it through the day and go to the bathroom.

481
01:19:46,767 --> 01:19:55,613
The Harmon School Association became the Medford Educational Foundation eventually, or migrated to that, and you were there for that as well.

482
01:19:57,546 --> 01:20:02,389
The parent involvement across the district has only increased in the years since then.

483
01:20:02,989 --> 01:20:05,191
People really do know one another.

484
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:17,958
Facebook has made that possible, yes, but it's been largely because we were able to consolidate our schools, even though it meant the loss of our beloved Hervey.

485
01:20:19,239 --> 01:20:24,963
But we understood that the little schools that we had did not have

486
01:20:26,416 --> 01:20:31,240
They didn't have, for instance, cafeterias, kids ate in the classroom.

487
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:35,764
They didn't have gyms, a lot of them.

488
01:20:36,245 --> 01:20:39,548
They didn't have a large meeting space for the school to gather.

489
01:20:40,695 --> 01:20:56,978
They did not have elevators, and we didn't realize how many parents and students were not able to enter those buildings on the first day of school until we built the new schools and saw that for ourselves.

490
01:20:57,498 --> 01:21:08,480
The first day the books opened, we had two parents in wheelchairs who never, ever would have been able to share the first day of school with their children.

491
01:21:09,355 --> 01:21:10,895
until we built those schools.

492
01:21:12,095 --> 01:21:13,496
Think how heartbreaking it was.

493
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:18,957
They were never able to meet with the teacher in the classroom their child was in.

494
01:21:20,197 --> 01:21:21,497
We did that with the new schools.

495
01:21:22,737 --> 01:21:29,479
You've been around long enough to see the effects of the change from MCAT to MCAS.

496
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:37,060
From every form and the effects on school committee governance, it changed dramatically during that time.

497
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:42,545
The rise of charter schools, all of our new schools.

498
01:21:43,285 --> 01:21:45,606
It's been an incredible ride.

499
01:21:46,726 --> 01:21:47,606
Thank you very much.

500
01:22:01,229 --> 01:22:03,710
Thank you both for taking us down memory lane.

501
01:22:06,098 --> 01:22:09,288
Also this evening we have representatives from our school buildings.

502
01:22:11,408 --> 01:22:16,231
And so, Paulette, you see each of our individual schools as communities.

503
01:22:16,811 --> 01:22:20,634
And like all communities, they require investment and care.

504
01:22:21,754 --> 01:22:23,475
You have modeled that for each of us.

505
01:22:24,176 --> 01:22:35,503
At this time, to begin our presentation, I would like to ask the representatives from our schools to come forward to offer some tokens of appreciation, which will be presented

506
01:22:36,203 --> 01:22:42,311
by two individuals who have worked with Paulette for a long time for a significant portion of our service.

507
01:22:44,314 --> 01:22:49,356
Our former Associate Superintendent Diane Caldwell and Principal Paul DeLeva.

508
01:22:49,736 --> 01:22:57,998
I would also like our other Principals and Administrators who are here to please come forward and represent the Administrators.

509
01:22:58,018 --> 01:22:59,298
We have Chad Fallon here.

510
01:22:59,318 --> 01:23:01,239
We have Diane Garino, Ms.

511
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:07,281
Shannon Demos, Dr. Kathy Kaye, Doreen Andrews, Nancy Sherman-Hudson.

512
01:23:08,161 --> 01:23:12,286
Administrators, you can come forward.

513
01:23:12,447 --> 01:23:13,167
Thank you so much.

514
01:23:13,187 --> 01:23:15,190
I hope I didn't miss anyone.

515
01:23:15,210 --> 01:23:22,579
It's going to be a little crowded up here.

516
01:23:31,868 --> 01:23:42,318
So Paulette, it is my pleasure and my honor to say a few words about a person that I've known and admired for many, many years.

517
01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:48,393
You have been the anchor of the school committee for 32 years.

518
01:23:49,314 --> 01:23:58,540
Your knowledge of education and incredible love for the children and families of Medford has always been front and center.

519
01:23:59,521 --> 01:24:07,687
Your commitment and dedication to the medical school committee and community has been extraordinary in my estimation.

520
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:13,540
And I cannot remember you missing any school committee meetings.

521
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:18,852
Maybe there was one or two, but I was here every other week and you were as well.

522
01:24:19,807 --> 01:24:23,548
You were diligent about making sure you read the packets.

523
01:24:23,589 --> 01:24:25,629
Remember those old-fashioned packets we had?

524
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:27,510
Big folders.

525
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:34,973
And there were occasions when you would stop by the high school at four or five o'clock at night when we were still working on them.

526
01:24:35,433 --> 01:24:37,134
And we said, can I have mine now?

527
01:24:37,154 --> 01:24:38,654
Because you needed to start reading.

528
01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:39,715
You didn't want to miss a thing.

529
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:45,742
You've been a supporter of the arts for as long as I can remember.

530
01:24:45,762 --> 01:24:51,364
And it was so appropriate tonight that they were here to give you a Christmas send off.

531
01:24:52,724 --> 01:25:03,328
If I could speak on a personal note for a moment, as a teacher and administrator, I have always felt comfortable seeking out your opinion and advice.

532
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:10,171
We didn't always agree, but you were always very respectful and understanding.

533
01:25:11,498 --> 01:25:19,163
So it's very bittersweet for us on behalf of all of the principals and administrators that are here with us tonight.

534
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:32,573
We thank you so much for all the years that you gave to Medford and we wish you and Bob and your whole family a long, healthy and happy retirement.

535
01:25:44,424 --> 01:25:45,885
school committee member, Vanna Kloop.

536
01:25:47,045 --> 01:25:51,907
During your tenure here at MPS, you've seen your own children grow through the Marburg Public Schools.

537
01:25:52,527 --> 01:25:59,309
One of them there had the pleasure to meet, and her husband, as I was a student teacher in the high school, in a physics class.

538
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:02,951
You've seen thousands of students grow through the system.

539
01:26:03,691 --> 01:26:09,493
Some of them have returned to do their calling, becoming educators and giving back to the community, like Mr. Nick Pucci.

540
01:26:10,953 --> 01:26:14,194
You've also been part of a longstanding president, Mr. Kirk Johnson.

541
01:26:15,595 --> 01:26:24,779
You've seen Beverly Nelson, Diane Caldwell, Suzanne DeLucie, in those years of being educators, and then rising to the assistant superintendent levels.

542
01:26:25,960 --> 01:26:32,583
You've watched Diane Garino and I move into educational leadership roles from our humble beginnings, and the list is endless.

543
01:26:34,124 --> 01:26:36,625
Many of us have stories to share about our interactions with you.

544
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:45,083
You're a big proponent of how we were able to receive buildings in 2001 for our middle and elementary schools.

545
01:26:46,044 --> 01:26:54,246
I pretty much remember you and Beth Fuller going to many meetings and reminding everyone to invest in the future of Metro Public Schools.

546
01:26:55,807 --> 01:27:03,169
Also, when 21st Century Learning was coming about, you were one of the members that went up to the city council and said, it's time for a change.

547
01:27:03,449 --> 01:27:05,070
We need to be in the forefront.

548
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:05,910
We need your help.

549
01:27:06,835 --> 01:27:08,156
and didn't go unnoticed.

550
01:27:09,717 --> 01:27:13,900
And when election time came, if you gave a who, you voted for Anikud.

551
01:27:15,882 --> 01:27:25,409
School committee member Paul Anikud, I'd like to speak for all the administrators and educators that you've truly been a very special person on every school committee that you've ever served.

552
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:31,374
We appreciate your service and we wish you the best as you move forward into your new ventures.

553
01:27:31,894 --> 01:27:32,235
Thank you.

554
01:27:35,847 --> 01:27:39,499
We have some gifts to give to you.

555
01:27:39,519 --> 01:27:40,682
We'd like to thank you.

556
01:27:56,118 --> 01:27:57,960
Thank you so much, administrators.

557
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,601
I would also, yes.

558
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:01,223
Madam Superintendent, one moment.

559
01:28:01,563 --> 01:28:07,749
The principals would like to share with member Bandiclute some beautiful cards that the children have written.

560
01:28:07,929 --> 01:28:13,274
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

561
01:28:28,556 --> 01:28:42,047
I also wanted to just thank the central office team that was just standing, all of the assistant superintendents, Galusi, Murphy, Cushing, Williams, and Vern.

562
01:28:42,987 --> 01:28:47,351
The central office team sends great congratulations your way as well.

563
01:28:47,371 --> 01:28:48,632
Thank you.

564
01:28:50,299 --> 01:29:06,723
Also with us this evening is someone who knows well both how challenging serving on a school committee can be and how unique it is for someone as talented as Paulette to be willing to do it for 32 years.

565
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:15,746
Please welcome, from the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, Executive Director Glenn Coulter.

566
01:29:16,486 --> 01:29:17,066
Please come forward.

567
01:29:25,167 --> 01:29:28,349
Thank you, Madam Mayor, Madam Superintendent, members of the school committee.

568
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:30,891
Thank you for this opportunity.

569
01:29:31,391 --> 01:29:34,293
I will honor Glenn's law, which is brief is good.

570
01:29:36,474 --> 01:29:44,540
It's been said of lengthy school committee meetings that everything that needs to be said has been said, but not everyone has said it yet.

571
01:29:47,822 --> 01:29:49,563
That wasn't me, that was Roy Belson.

572
01:29:49,943 --> 01:29:52,205
He taught me that.

573
01:29:53,025 --> 01:29:59,069
And it is great to see everybody, and it's nice to see Anne-Marie Cunha, a former board member with Paulette van de Kloop.

574
01:30:00,390 --> 01:30:22,385
I just want to say very briefly that among the characteristics that I will most remember about Paulette were not necessarily her leadership, although there was leadership on key issues like intergenerational issues, like advocating for immigrant children, like luncheons.

575
01:30:23,807 --> 01:30:25,087
An end of food shame.

576
01:30:25,928 --> 01:30:28,949
The rights of LGBTQ students was that.

577
01:30:29,609 --> 01:30:35,211
But Paulette always had the courage to be at odds with the majority.

578
01:30:36,071 --> 01:30:44,114
When all around you devolves in chaos, we seek a rational person to bring calm.

579
01:30:45,755 --> 01:30:48,916
And that wasn't me, that was from Don Quixote, but that's...

580
01:30:51,299 --> 01:30:57,420
I think of Paulette when I think of standing there, doing what's right, and doing the right thing.

581
01:30:57,580 --> 01:31:02,961
And to summarize quickly by saying that Paulette was a person of honor and integrity.

582
01:31:03,581 --> 01:31:10,283
And service to others is not the way she made her living, but it was the way she made her life.

583
01:31:11,423 --> 01:31:13,043
And we are very pleased.

584
01:31:14,283 --> 01:31:16,744
You probably don't have enough plaques from us in your living room.

585
01:31:18,613 --> 01:31:28,775
This is the Distinguished Service Award for 2021, and it's presented by our association on behalf of our membership to Paulette Vander Kloot.

586
01:31:42,358 --> 01:31:43,518
It comes with this free

587
01:32:00,164 --> 01:32:02,765
Thank you, Mr. Kuchar for joining us this evening.

588
01:32:04,086 --> 01:32:10,508
Also, I would like to thank our city councilor, Mr. Zack Beers, who's here with us this evening.

589
01:32:11,709 --> 01:32:21,533
Many of our elected officials who could not be here in person, but wanted to send along their commendations to share those along with their thoughts.

590
01:32:22,174 --> 01:32:29,717
We will now turn the floor over to Paulette's current colleagues with members McLaughlin and member Graham.

591
01:32:33,867 --> 01:32:34,948
You go on.

592
01:32:38,392 --> 01:32:39,353
Yes, you can tilt it in.

593
01:32:40,494 --> 01:32:42,716
They can hear.

594
01:32:44,198 --> 01:32:44,538
Perfect.

595
01:32:44,658 --> 01:32:56,490
I like the other way too.

596
01:32:57,151 --> 01:33:01,493
Thank you, Paulette, for all of your service to our children in the community.

597
01:33:01,553 --> 01:33:10,196
It's been a pleasure being a colleague of yours and on both sides of this podium, learning from you, both as a parent and as a colleague.

598
01:33:10,216 --> 01:33:26,323
32 years of service is remarkable, and I was just trying to do some of the math, and I know how long these meetings can be, so I'm sure I'm underestimating, but I'm ballparking somewhere over 800 hours of service and volunteer hours in meetings that you've committed

599
01:33:26,823 --> 01:33:29,186
over your 32 years to our students and our community.

600
01:33:36,534 --> 01:33:43,722
So I'm going to hand it over to our colleague member Graham for this Massachusetts State Senate official citation.

601
01:33:46,583 --> 01:33:57,789
So President Spoka, Clerk Hurley, and Senator Jalen have sent along the Commonwealth of Massachusetts State Senate official citation.

602
01:33:57,809 --> 01:34:03,632
Be it known that the Massachusetts Senate hereby extends its congratulations to Paulette Vander Kloof.

603
01:34:04,332 --> 01:34:24,666
In recognition of your 32 years of outstanding and dedicated service to the Medford School Committee, and be it further known that the Massachusetts Senate extends its best wishes for continued success, that this citation be duly signed by the President of the Senate and attested to in a copy that are transmitted to the Clerk of the Senate.

604
01:34:33,290 --> 01:34:34,311
Congratulations.

605
01:34:37,353 --> 01:34:37,673
Thank you.

606
01:34:37,713 --> 01:34:46,519
I would now like to invite Member Russo forward to give remarks and present a citation from Representative Clark.

607
01:35:01,327 --> 01:35:03,769
I haven't spoken from this one I think ever actually.

608
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:08,372
So I'll start with just my remarks.

609
01:35:09,773 --> 01:35:14,876
So joining a school committee is quite an experience.

610
01:35:16,177 --> 01:35:25,964
My very first term within a couple of weeks, we had a crisis, which at the time everybody said, once you've been through this, you're gonna be good.

611
01:35:26,344 --> 01:35:28,906
And then apparently that was a lie.

612
01:35:32,805 --> 01:35:37,068
made me feel very much like just so comfortable.

613
01:35:38,069 --> 01:35:46,315
She was so calm, I think Mr. Kuchar had mentioned that calmness is a feature, actually several people have probably mentioned that.

614
01:35:49,197 --> 01:35:52,118
And I think that calmness came from experience, I assume.

615
01:35:54,479 --> 01:36:06,922
And, you know, when I think about what Paulette brought to the school committee, although for a couple more hours, I think about how the context of how we, you know, how we got where we are today.

616
01:36:08,022 --> 01:36:21,437
Having that historical knowledge, I assume helps her become, and it certainly provides calmness to me and I believe my colleagues, when we're facing things that are new to us.

617
01:36:21,517 --> 01:36:24,100
My first question is, well, what does Paulette know about this?

618
01:36:25,141 --> 01:36:26,122
Because I assume you know.

619
01:36:26,943 --> 01:36:32,585
a lot about a lot of the things that we have faced, although I'm not sure you've been through a pandemic before.

620
01:36:34,326 --> 01:36:42,669
So I just wanna say, I greatly appreciate your historical knowledge and the fact that your context gives you this calmness.

621
01:36:43,609 --> 01:36:46,390
I don't know if you, maybe you were calm before you joined the school committee.

622
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:47,170
How would I know?

623
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:54,353
But it's definitely something that changes the air and I'm going to miss that greatly.

624
01:36:54,993 --> 01:36:58,235
I am still probably going to call you every time I'm like, how did we get where we are today?

625
01:36:58,255 --> 01:37:02,338
Because most of us now will not actually have answers to that question.

626
01:37:03,038 --> 01:37:08,162
And as Beth Fuller mentioned, it was before the internet and all that other stuff.

627
01:37:08,202 --> 01:37:10,383
So we can't just Google, how did we get here?

628
01:37:11,384 --> 01:37:20,890
So thank you so much for providing just that context and history and calmness and the room to feel so welcome.

629
01:37:23,262 --> 01:37:25,044
So this one isn't as wordy.

630
01:37:25,484 --> 01:37:30,610
This is from representative Catherine Clark, who was also a school committee member.

631
01:37:31,511 --> 01:37:38,257
I do love to remind everybody of people who have gone into other offices who were school committee members.

632
01:37:39,599 --> 01:37:45,065
The first time I met Catherine was at the high school for a run, I forget which run,

633
01:37:46,265 --> 01:37:58,869
And one of the first things she said was, was the hardest job ever and that is sort of a theme from anybody who's in a different elected office now, they say that the school committee was the hardest job they ever had in politics.

634
01:38:01,883 --> 01:38:07,086
I mean, I don't have context to say whether that's true, but it seems pretty good, like a good assessment.

635
01:38:07,606 --> 01:38:19,653
So this is a certificate of special congressional recognition presented to Paula Vander Kloot in recognition of outstanding and invaluable service to the community, signed today by Catherine M. Clark, member of Congress.

636
01:38:31,752 --> 01:38:32,513
Thank you.

637
01:38:32,593 --> 01:38:41,748
So I would now like to invite member of the storm forward to make some remarks and to present a citation from our own governor Baker.

638
01:38:51,951 --> 01:38:56,533
I just asked Jenny to Google if Governor Baker was on the school committee, because I think he was.

639
01:38:56,593 --> 01:38:57,173
So you're right.

640
01:38:57,233 --> 01:39:03,456
Paulette, you can be governor next.

641
01:39:03,816 --> 01:39:07,058
So this is from Governor Baker and Lieutenant Governor Perito.

642
01:39:07,998 --> 01:39:08,699
in its form.

643
01:39:08,899 --> 01:39:25,578
On behalf of the citizens of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I am pleased to confer upon you this Governor's citation and recognition of your 32 years of dedicated service as a member of the Medford School Committee to Paulette Van de Kloet the 20th day of December in the year 2021.

644
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:28,001
I do just want to briefly say

645
01:39:28,802 --> 01:39:31,785
that I've appreciated so much working with you for these past six years.

646
01:39:31,805 --> 01:39:36,710
Honestly, it's incredible the service you've given to the city of Medford.

647
01:39:36,730 --> 01:39:42,255
I don't think anyone else in the city has given 32 years of their life or Bob's life.

648
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:49,543
So I thank you and I look forward to having a drink with you after this.

649
01:39:57,696 --> 01:39:59,078
Thank you, Member Winslow.

650
01:39:59,898 --> 01:40:01,520
I'd like to invite Member Kretz up.

651
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:06,266
She's going to present some remarks and a citation from Senator Markey.

652
01:40:20,753 --> 01:40:24,715
I just want to thank you for your 32 years of service and your friendship.

653
01:40:25,796 --> 01:40:28,758
Just like everybody said here tonight, it's just incredible.

654
01:40:29,559 --> 01:40:36,223
Your knowledge, your kindness, you know, we can call you, text you with any questions.

655
01:40:36,344 --> 01:40:37,925
You have a remarkable memory.

656
01:40:38,485 --> 01:40:40,266
you seem to remember everything.

657
01:40:40,286 --> 01:40:49,311
I don't know how you do it and I'm so glad you know my son got to know you with the volunteer program and you know you were a great mentor.

658
01:40:49,371 --> 01:41:07,182
He just loves volunteering and I'm so glad that he started with that program and it got him into a schedule and it just seems that everything you do it's just it's just wonderful and incredible and I'm so happy for you for your retirement to spend time with your grandchildren and your family and just to have

659
01:41:07,622 --> 01:41:08,402
more free time.

660
01:41:08,802 --> 01:41:11,343
You really deserve it, and I'm really happy for you.

661
01:41:11,764 --> 01:41:15,285
And I will miss you, and I'll probably reach out to you.

662
01:41:15,765 --> 01:41:19,166
So I have a citation, and I'll read it now.

663
01:41:20,267 --> 01:41:34,252
This is a certificate of special congressional recognition presented to Paulette Vanderkoot for her 32 years exemplary as member of Memphis School Committee in recognition of outstanding and invaluable service to the community.

664
01:41:34,752 --> 01:41:36,953
Signed by Senator Ed Mackey.

665
01:41:53,692 --> 01:41:54,893
I forgot my own remarks.

666
01:41:55,453 --> 01:41:59,576
So I two years ago when I was out campaigning I knocked on a woman's door.

667
01:42:10,482 --> 01:42:13,984
And we had a like 20 minute long conversation at her door.

668
01:42:14,605 --> 01:42:18,207
And I think she said that her kids went to school with Paulette's kids.

669
01:42:19,008 --> 01:42:21,249
And she said, do you know Paulette?

670
01:42:21,289 --> 01:42:23,110
And I said, why, yes, I do.

671
01:42:23,611 --> 01:42:29,374
We had worked on the superintendent search committee together that ultimately hired you, superintendent.

672
01:42:29,394 --> 01:42:30,255
Good job, good job.

673
01:42:33,759 --> 01:42:38,543
And also, we had worked on a number of things together when I was a parent.

674
01:42:39,143 --> 01:42:45,668
And this woman said, well, you know, before Paulette, parents weren't members of the school committee.

675
01:42:45,688 --> 01:42:47,970
And I said, really?

676
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:48,570
OK.

677
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:52,894
And I didn't know, but I was like, and she said, but Paulette is the one that changed that.

678
01:42:52,974 --> 01:42:56,036
Paulette is the reason why there are parents on the school committee today.

679
01:42:56,056 --> 01:42:57,257
So thank you.

680
01:43:04,337 --> 01:43:05,098
and you will be missed.

681
01:43:07,059 --> 01:43:08,040
Thank you.

682
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:14,844
So I almost want to do a drum roll because, uh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

683
01:43:15,385 --> 01:43:20,008
We're going to have take the podium right now.

684
01:43:20,368 --> 01:43:26,132
And, um, we have some special things to present governor Paulette.

685
01:43:29,011 --> 01:43:30,512
whatever you choose in your retirement.

686
01:43:31,732 --> 01:43:44,998
I'm going to be brief as well but I just want to say I've always respected you as a counselor when you were a school committee member but and I know you were thinking should you run the last time and I just want to

687
01:43:45,858 --> 01:43:48,200
from the bottom of my heart, thank you for doing so.

688
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:53,203
These last two years have been extremely difficult for all of us.

689
01:43:53,764 --> 01:44:09,395
Myself never have served in the school committee, a couple others that were very recent and you helped lead the committee through the toughest two years that I've ever been in politics and probably in your 32 years as well.

690
01:44:10,176 --> 01:44:14,459
There were nights where we would have eight hour meetings and I'd say, I need to come in and sit in

691
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:26,588
say something and say the right thing and you would swoop in and just calmly and rationally solve what we needed to be solved at that moment.

692
01:44:26,748 --> 01:44:33,013
Or I would be home racking my brain on something school related and I would look at my phone and you'd be calling.

693
01:44:33,073 --> 01:44:39,118
It's almost like you knew when you needed to reach out to brainstorm or review something so we could try to

694
01:44:40,593 --> 01:44:41,194
make it better.

695
01:44:41,714 --> 01:44:44,096
And it's really helped me the last two years.

696
01:44:44,156 --> 01:44:51,941
I look up to you as a friend, as a colleague, and I just thank you for all you have done for all of our kids.

697
01:44:52,761 --> 01:44:53,902
We really appreciate it.

698
01:44:53,942 --> 01:44:56,204
I wish you the best of luck in your retirement.

699
01:44:56,864 --> 01:44:57,625
Congratulations.

700
01:45:04,729 --> 01:45:16,399
On behalf of the administration, the entire Medford School, public school community, we have the honor of presenting this final gift, which has an inscription here.

701
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:19,221
Right, Dr. Cushing?

702
01:45:19,461 --> 01:45:20,422
It's okay, it's okay.

703
01:45:22,704 --> 01:45:25,687
Oh, you want me to read it?

704
01:45:25,827 --> 01:45:27,348
Paulette Van Der Koeuw.

705
01:45:27,968 --> 01:45:28,529
Given who?

706
01:45:28,549 --> 01:45:29,290
No, I'm just kidding.

707
01:45:33,099 --> 01:45:36,503
gratitude for 32 years of service to the method public schools.

708
01:46:01,017 --> 01:46:07,381
So, member Van Der Kroot, you would put in a special request.

709
01:46:08,442 --> 01:46:17,667
And so that was the big, big one for you that you can read stories and enjoy when you go home.

710
01:46:17,808 --> 01:46:24,071
But you put in a request a few years back, and I kept that special request in mind.

711
01:46:27,397 --> 01:46:40,862
I want you to know as I present you with this request, again, echoing the mayor's sentiments as well, that your contributions have been immeasurable.

712
01:46:42,923 --> 01:46:48,046
We don't want your contributions to stop, even though you are officially stepping down.

713
01:46:48,386 --> 01:46:51,787
We value you very deeply.

714
01:46:52,168 --> 01:47:06,955
And on the school side, we want you to know that we want you to continue to partner with us and provide counsel and guidance as a school committee member emeritus, as you had said to me the other day.

715
01:47:06,975 --> 01:47:11,017
But I have a special gift that you made a special request for.

716
01:47:12,085 --> 01:47:20,475
and I don't know if you recall, it says Paulette Vanderkoop, champion of our schools.

717
01:47:21,236 --> 01:47:24,700
Medford thanks you for 32 years of service.

718
01:47:46,313 --> 01:47:48,613
And so now, finally, I welcome you, Ms.

719
01:47:48,633 --> 01:47:54,795
van der Kroot, to come to the podium and share your remarks, your words with us.

720
01:47:54,875 --> 01:47:58,937
Thank you again for your dedicated service of 32 years.

721
01:48:16,173 --> 01:48:21,338
You know, it's a little bit like attending your own funeral, but you get to hear it.

722
01:48:21,478 --> 01:48:23,920
It's really great.

723
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:28,684
I highly recommend it.

724
01:48:28,804 --> 01:48:30,045
One more citation.

725
01:48:30,706 --> 01:48:31,206
Oh, thank you.

726
01:48:31,266 --> 01:48:31,927
One more citation.

727
01:48:32,207 --> 01:48:37,312
Be proud of all the work you've done, the person you are, and the difference you have made for the past 32 years.

728
01:48:37,332 --> 01:48:38,273
Thank you so much.

729
01:48:39,293 --> 01:48:39,594
Thank you.

730
01:48:44,702 --> 01:48:48,865
Bob, we have plenty of things now to wallpaper our house with.

731
01:48:49,685 --> 01:48:54,869
First, thank you for being with me tonight, either present here in City Hall or over Zoom.

732
01:48:55,689 --> 01:49:02,234
In all my wildest dreams, I never expected to be speaking to a group of masked people or donning a mask myself.

733
01:49:03,174 --> 01:49:11,140
I am sure that over the years, especially in the earliest ones, there were times when certain people might have wished I was masked, or at least,

734
01:49:12,437 --> 01:49:22,063
a little bit less loquacious, but let's face it, the job of a school committee person rests largely on words and the ability to persuade.

735
01:49:22,904 --> 01:49:28,727
Before I go on, I want to extend a warm welcome and congratulations to my successor, Sharon Hayes.

736
01:49:29,288 --> 01:49:29,668
Sharon.

737
01:49:36,305 --> 01:49:40,690
I feel confident that you will bring your knowledge, insight, and thoughtfulness to the school committee.

738
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:42,432
I will be cheering you on.

739
01:49:43,653 --> 01:49:54,364
Thank you to Lisa Evangelista and Susie Weiss for your work, helping me put this evening together, and also for all of the assistance you've given over the years.

740
01:49:55,553 --> 01:49:58,455
So last week, a funny thing was happening at my house.

741
01:49:59,455 --> 01:50:06,999
On two separate nights, we were awakened by our dog, Pippi, barking with great agitation.

742
01:50:07,919 --> 01:50:09,720
Something was up, including me.

743
01:50:10,581 --> 01:50:13,022
After I got her to quiet down, I heard it.

744
01:50:13,843 --> 01:50:15,123
Hoot, hoot!

745
01:50:16,184 --> 01:50:16,804
And ow!

746
01:50:17,745 --> 01:50:21,326
Over and over, it was calling, hoot, hoot!

747
01:50:23,413 --> 01:50:31,499
Now, you all know my slogan, and everybody's been reminded of it over and over, Give a Hoot the Underclute.

748
01:50:32,039 --> 01:50:35,721
And my owl appeared every two years without fail.

749
01:50:37,523 --> 01:50:40,565
But if I had any doubts last week,

750
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:52,891
It was clear the owls had come to reclaim my owl, and it was time for my owl and me to retire and go about other owly and other things.

751
01:50:54,075 --> 01:50:56,796
I've loved this work and all the things that have gone with it.

752
01:50:57,376 --> 01:51:20,022
Being connected to so many people of Medford, working with outstanding educational leaders, relishing the accomplishments of our students, some of which you heard tonight with the musical students, interacting with our very supportive legislative leaders, being part of the larger Massachusetts Association of School Committees, meetings with my colleagues,

753
01:51:21,359 --> 01:51:25,426
many meetings with my colleagues, more meetings with my colleagues.

754
01:51:25,446 --> 01:51:28,913
I guarantee you 800 numbers is not enough.

755
01:51:31,251 --> 01:51:34,952
Last March broke the all-time record with something like 45 meetings.

756
01:51:35,772 --> 01:51:43,915
By the way, some might think that the longest meeting held was one of the marathon meetings held in this time of COVID, but it was not.

757
01:51:44,815 --> 01:51:48,296
Rather, the longest meeting I attended finished past 2 a.m.

758
01:51:48,336 --> 01:52:00,480
in the morning, a budget meeting during the time of then Special Education Director Ernie Demos, a dedicated man far more worthy than I will ever be.

759
01:52:01,690 --> 01:52:06,574
There are so many people who I've had the great opportunity to work with.

760
01:52:07,214 --> 01:52:11,757
But before I acknowledge just a few, I promised myself I would not pull a Mike McGlynn.

761
01:52:12,658 --> 01:52:20,064
See, Mayor McGlynn had the habit of making marvelous speeches, acknowledging many, and then leaving his family to the end.

762
01:52:21,004 --> 01:52:26,128
And then he would wrap up and then suddenly realize he had missed the most important people in the world, his family.

763
01:52:26,648 --> 01:52:28,069
So I'm starting with my family.

764
01:52:28,990 --> 01:52:42,678
To my dear husband, Bob, the most patient man in the world, thank you for your continued support, your work on my many campaigns, your support as I ran out the door, leaving you with, at the time, our three young kids.

765
01:52:44,003 --> 01:52:53,070
Then, thank you, fast forward, during the time of Zoom meetings for putting up with the tension that came with those meetings in our house.

766
01:52:54,111 --> 01:53:01,296
And thank you for delivering those delicious dinners that was one upside to having meetings at home by Zoom.

767
01:53:02,377 --> 01:53:06,140
Bob, you're an incredible man and incredible support, and I love you dearly.

768
01:53:07,401 --> 01:53:08,542
Thank you to my three daughters.

769
01:53:14,108 --> 01:53:18,970
Kate, Megan, and Liz, who put up with their mom being on the school committee, which was a lot.

770
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:28,193
Phone calls during dinner, going out shopping with mom only to have her stopped by a constituent, photo shoots for campaign literature, and we'll get to that in a bit.

771
01:53:29,074 --> 01:53:35,656
I know that there was one upside in the early years when you were the very first to know about snow days.

772
01:53:37,017 --> 01:53:39,718
That doesn't happen anymore because everybody knows at once.

773
01:53:41,010 --> 01:53:44,372
Being the child of an elected official is not easy.

774
01:53:45,353 --> 01:53:54,359
I love you, my sweet daughters, and thank you for your support and for choosing such fine partners in life, Dave Ryan, Todd Prokop, and Jamie VanderKloot.

775
01:53:54,859 --> 01:54:02,264
And of course, there are my three wonderful grandsons, Harry, who is eight, Charlie, who is five, and Ezra, who is four.

776
01:54:04,290 --> 01:54:10,115
Oh, hi.

777
01:54:10,275 --> 01:54:13,197
And Megan is here, and Liz and Jamie are here.

778
01:54:13,237 --> 01:54:14,338
Todd's home with Ezra.

779
01:54:15,279 --> 01:54:16,920
And they've all been so supportive.

780
01:54:18,421 --> 01:54:22,705
I am so fortunate to have had the help and support of my friends throughout the years.

781
01:54:23,305 --> 01:54:26,108
I credit my first win to two forces in life.

782
01:54:29,222 --> 01:54:36,324
First, the very timely arrival of my daughter, Liz, who was born on my first election day.

783
01:54:37,065 --> 01:54:37,705
Thank you, Liz.

784
01:54:38,885 --> 01:54:42,987
Now, Peter, if I could ask you to turn on, will I be able to see what's up?

785
01:54:44,007 --> 01:54:46,888
Oh, this is... So the first one.

786
01:54:49,316 --> 01:54:53,620
So this is the first piece of election campaign literature I had.

787
01:54:54,020 --> 01:55:00,926
You'll notice that there's only two children in it because that's Kate and Megan, because Liz was yet to be born.

788
01:55:03,429 --> 01:55:04,570
If you could go to the next one.

789
01:55:06,732 --> 01:55:07,392
There we are.

790
01:55:07,412 --> 01:55:10,835
And she wasn't born the day before election day.

791
01:55:10,875 --> 01:55:12,317
She was born on election day.

792
01:55:13,417 --> 01:55:13,898
There we go.

793
01:55:14,378 --> 01:55:14,899
The next one.

794
01:55:16,138 --> 01:55:16,538
Let's see.

795
01:55:16,959 --> 01:55:17,879
Oh, here we are.

796
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:20,882
And if you notice, this is the one I think that Peaches is in.

797
01:55:21,943 --> 01:55:27,508
Peaches was our first dog, and Peaches, well, frankly, more people knew Peaches than they knew me.

798
01:55:27,968 --> 01:55:38,397
Now, Mike McGlynn used to love a parade, and when we walked through the streets, Peaches would accompany us, and more people would shout out, Peaches, Peaches, than they would Paulette.

799
01:55:38,957 --> 01:55:40,959
So anyway, that's why I included that one.

800
01:55:41,259 --> 01:55:41,900
And is there one more?

801
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:43,300
That might be it.

802
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:52,483
Oh, and this is fast forward to 2019 with my three grandsons now there.

803
01:55:52,963 --> 01:55:58,065
So over the years, there's many more in between, but those were ones I wanted to show you tonight.

804
01:55:59,095 --> 01:56:00,256
Thank you.

805
01:56:00,877 --> 01:56:13,208
I am so fortunate to have the help and support of friends already I said that the second force was to my campaign manager, Dick O'Mara, who sadly has long left this world.

806
01:56:13,929 --> 01:56:16,851
Dick was a force of nature and a taskmaster.

807
01:56:17,652 --> 01:56:21,136
Nine months pregnant, and I was knocking on doors and giving a hoot.

808
01:56:22,177 --> 01:56:29,185
I'd like to extend my thanks to Dick's wife, Gail, and his kids, Kathleen and Brian, who were so helpful in my early years.

809
01:56:30,126 --> 01:56:37,654
And to other friends who have been so kind and supportive, in particular, my treasure and great friend, Dr. Laurie Davidson, who is with us tonight.

810
01:56:38,815 --> 01:56:48,099
And my wordsmith, David Locke, who sat with me as we painstakingly hammered out the right words for my campaign literature, and he's the photographer tonight.

811
01:56:48,939 --> 01:56:56,582
I am very fortunate to have had the blessing of my director or boss at Winchester Hospital, Marie Johnson, also here tonight.

812
01:56:57,522 --> 01:57:11,255
So when I skipped out to attend a function or run off to a meeting, and also thanks to my great co-workers Donna and Jillian, I am truly blessed to have a wide circle of loving friends and family who have always been supportive and there for me.

813
01:57:11,716 --> 01:57:12,336
Thank you all.

814
01:57:13,397 --> 01:57:17,938
I've also been extraordinarily lucky to have so many reach out and thank me when I announced my retirement.

815
01:57:18,679 --> 01:57:22,059
Many of you recounted specific times when I had been helpful to you.

816
01:57:22,580 --> 01:57:30,062
It's meant the world to me, and I thank the citizens of Medford for your thoughtfulness and support, not only recently, but over 32 years.

817
01:57:32,109 --> 01:57:39,534
As a school committee member, I had the opportunity to work with school committee members from across Massachusetts in our professional organization.

818
01:57:40,175 --> 01:57:47,780
This is a real asset to members as it enables us to understand that the challenges our community face are so often shared.

819
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:57,447
I want to thank Glenn Kuchar and the staff of the MASC, as well as the great school committee members from across Massachusetts that I had the privilege to meet and work with.

820
01:57:58,147 --> 01:58:03,811
I'd also like to thank our legal counselor, Trinity Howard-Greenspan, who, like me, has been here forever.

821
01:58:05,032 --> 01:58:15,259
During my tenure, I've had the privilege to serve with three Medford mayors, Mike McGlynn, Stephanie Muccini-Burke, and our current mayor, Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern.

822
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:26,227
While there are differences among you, and after all, this is politics, some tension between you, you all have in common a deep commitment to our city.

823
01:58:27,148 --> 01:58:33,609
I am thankful that I've had the opportunity to work with all of you, and I've appreciated your leadership and devotion to Medford.

824
01:58:34,209 --> 01:58:41,351
I'd also like to mention that I think Medford is extraordinarily fortunate that our mayor serves as the head of the school committee.

825
01:58:41,911 --> 01:58:48,972
This means that our mayors have been intimately aware of the goings on in our schools and the needs of our students.

826
01:58:49,632 --> 01:58:54,733
Personally, I think this has been a giant plus, and I hope it remains this way.

827
01:58:55,803 --> 01:59:02,548
I've also had the privilege to work with a host of other school committee members over the years, some of which have graciously joined us tonight.

828
01:59:03,348 --> 01:59:06,491
Some served years and years, others for a shorter duration.

829
01:59:07,151 --> 01:59:16,738
While I may have occasionally disagreed with you, we had a shared understanding that our work was dedicated to continuously working to improve the Medford public schools.

830
01:59:17,299 --> 01:59:21,522
I'm going to call out all of their names to acknowledge their service and dedication.

831
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:28,102
those that have left us, Bill Brady, Lena DiGiantomaso, and Fred Pompeo.

832
01:59:29,042 --> 01:59:43,967
And now my other colleagues, Mary Aliberti, Jimmy Giacomo, Fred Lasky, Carol Sharpton, Bob Scurry, Michael Marks, who is also leaving his elected role on the council, Jack Buckley, Bulldog Jack,

833
01:59:44,747 --> 02:00:08,817
Paul Camuso, Ed Nolan, Beth Fuller, my friend and confidant, Sharon Gusek, another friend and confidant, Ron Vining, John Falco, who I also extend my congratulations to, George Scarpelli, Bill O'Keefe, Michael Ruggiero, Aaron Z. Benedetto, and Ann Marie Cuno, who once served as the president of the MASC.

834
02:00:10,038 --> 02:00:15,189
and also to my current colleagues, Jenny, Kathy, Melanie, Mia, and Paul.

835
02:00:16,353 --> 02:00:23,557
Additionally, I'd like to acknowledge and once again, thank you for the work of the Building the Future Committee, led by Rick Orlando and Tricia McDonough.

836
02:00:24,038 --> 02:00:36,725
Of all the time I spent on the school committee, the period when we were deciding how to move forward with replacing our then current schools was one of the most productive and enjoyable of my tenure.

837
02:00:37,385 --> 02:00:41,208
Thank you to Tricia and Rick and all the members of the Building the Future Committee.

838
02:00:42,476 --> 02:00:44,258
Next is the really tough part.

839
02:00:44,998 --> 02:00:52,244
Acknowledging and thanking all the dedicated teachers, staff, and administrators who have dedicated their careers to our children.

840
02:00:52,904 --> 02:00:54,746
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

841
02:00:55,467 --> 02:00:58,429
I've been lucky to be in your classrooms, in our schools.

842
02:00:58,889 --> 02:01:02,552
I've attended so many events, concerts, and athletic competitions.

843
02:01:03,253 --> 02:01:06,596
I've seen our staff and teachers supporting our kids.

844
02:01:07,136 --> 02:01:11,479
And in this time of COVID, so many have just been superheroes.

845
02:01:12,320 --> 02:01:37,567
I thank each and every one, every custodian, bus driver, paraprofessional, lunch mother, school nurse, cafeteria worker, librarian, IT professional, guidance counselor, special education, administrative assistant, secretary, support staff, our dedicated afterschool staff members, staff of the Medford Family Network, Kids Corner, and of course, our teachers.

846
02:01:38,953 --> 02:01:44,114
As a school committee member, ultimately, we get to know our principals, directors, and administrative members the most.

847
02:01:44,714 --> 02:01:46,975
Thank you for all the reports you've brought to us.

848
02:01:47,315 --> 02:01:56,337
Well, maybe not those MCAS ones, because personally, I think purgatory is made of MCAS reports 24 hours a day.

849
02:01:56,357 --> 02:01:56,477
Yeah.

850
02:02:00,991 --> 02:02:10,143
Thank you for all your leadership and thank you for being patient when the latest educational acronym needs clarification yet again.

851
02:02:10,924 --> 02:02:13,467
The world of education is filled with acronyms.

852
02:02:14,418 --> 02:02:30,311
To our assistant superintendents, both past and present, and those who are here, and I'm so grateful for Beverly and Diane and all you guys up here in the front row cheering section, thank you for your countless hours of work, your patience, and your dedication.

853
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:37,277
I've worked with three superintendents of school, Phil DeVoe, Roy Belson, and Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vincent.

854
02:02:38,148 --> 02:02:41,550
Now, the first thing I have to tell you is that nobody, Carmen, are you listening?

855
02:02:42,631 --> 02:02:45,834
Nobody, she's our intern, superintendent intern.

856
02:02:46,234 --> 02:02:48,115
And so she wants to be a superintendent.

857
02:02:48,295 --> 02:02:48,876
She's crazy.

858
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:55,262
Now, the first thing I have to tell you is that nobody should want these jobs.

859
02:02:55,682 --> 02:02:56,362
It's tough.

860
02:02:57,142 --> 02:02:59,423
I don't know how superintendents do it, frankly.

861
02:02:59,904 --> 02:03:04,646
Everything they do, every decision they make, every conversation they have is under scrutiny.

862
02:03:05,226 --> 02:03:14,050
Seven people elected by the public who may know something about education, or maybe not so much, get to weigh in on their performance all the time.

863
02:03:14,770 --> 02:03:15,370
Good grief.

864
02:03:15,931 --> 02:03:17,652
They are on call 24-7.

865
02:03:18,172 --> 02:03:25,337
They have to become experts on everything, including weather, and whether there is going to be enough snow to justify calling off school.

866
02:03:26,458 --> 02:03:33,362
Thank you, Roy, for devoting 50 years of your life to the Medford Public Schools and for leading this district, for 23 of them.

867
02:03:33,842 --> 02:03:43,409
You started and guided so many great programs that are shining stars for Medford, including the Medford Family Network and the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

868
02:03:44,209 --> 02:03:47,010
And Maurice, thank you for stepping in and stepping up.

869
02:03:47,590 --> 02:03:50,851
Your leadership since the beginning of COVID has been very strong.

870
02:03:51,331 --> 02:03:54,592
You worked to get our students back in school at the earliest opportunity.

871
02:03:55,032 --> 02:04:04,434
Your guiding principles of ACE, achievement for all, collaboration for all, and equity for all, have guided your work and set the vision for our district.

872
02:04:04,914 --> 02:04:07,335
Dr. Edward Vincent, keep on going.

873
02:04:08,255 --> 02:04:11,777
It takes a long time to thank a lot of people that you've worked with for 32 years.

874
02:04:12,338 --> 02:04:13,759
Thank you for your kind indulgence.

875
02:04:14,619 --> 02:04:16,701
In leaving, I have two words of wisdom.

876
02:04:17,181 --> 02:04:18,182
Well, let's say thoughts.

877
02:04:19,456 --> 02:04:31,825
For my colleagues, the toughest time I've ever spent on the committee was when we had to lay off teachers and staff who were truly valuable, but because of a national economic crisis, we could not sustain.

878
02:04:32,706 --> 02:04:41,853
As you spend the ESSER money, please take to heart the need to spend wisely so that in some future date, you are not facing a dire situation.

879
02:04:42,513 --> 02:04:46,556
Yes, spend it for sure, but plan so that you put into place

880
02:04:47,397 --> 02:04:51,240
but plan so that what you put into place can be maintained for the future.

881
02:04:51,820 --> 02:04:53,441
It's going to be a huge challenge.

882
02:04:54,382 --> 02:04:58,284
And lastly, this period in our community and in our nation has been tough.

883
02:04:59,085 --> 02:05:01,266
The divisiveness has truly been heartbreaking.

884
02:05:01,907 --> 02:05:13,915
While we cannot snap our fingers and fix the entire national divide, it is incumbent on every local elected official and each of us to listen to and work with all of our fellow citizens and constituents.

885
02:05:14,615 --> 02:05:16,136
Let's find a way to build bridges.

886
02:05:17,237 --> 02:05:18,898
We have the best students in Medford.

887
02:05:19,398 --> 02:05:20,999
They have so much hope and promise.

888
02:05:21,159 --> 02:05:22,599
You heard some of them tonight.

889
02:05:23,459 --> 02:05:30,362
I thank them and I thank all of you for your extraordinary opportunity I have had in being a member of the Medford School Committee.

890
02:05:31,302 --> 02:05:37,765
Now I'm going to finish with an inside joke, which some of you will understand and many of you won't, but

891
02:05:39,186 --> 02:05:48,213
In honor of the late former athletic director, Bud Kelly, I have blue and white running through my veins.

892
02:05:49,394 --> 02:05:50,975
So, thank you all.

893
02:05:51,175 --> 02:05:52,076
I appreciate it.

894
02:06:05,065 --> 02:06:06,627
Thank you, member Wanda Clay.

895
02:06:20,962 --> 02:06:22,623
We have number six.

896
02:06:22,643 --> 02:06:29,987
I don't know if anybody wants to move to wave.

897
02:06:49,309 --> 02:06:51,452
Move toward the reading of the agenda.

898
02:06:52,273 --> 02:06:54,295
Presentation of the public, seconded by?

899
02:06:54,315 --> 02:06:55,076
Second.

900
02:06:55,517 --> 02:06:56,438
