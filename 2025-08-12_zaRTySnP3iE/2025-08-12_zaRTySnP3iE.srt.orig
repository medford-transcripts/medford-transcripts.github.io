1
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:50,309
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, welcome everybody to day three of the Medford Jazz Festival.

2
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:51,829
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you I haven't, yeah, I know.

3
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,850
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.

4
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,450
[SPEAKER_00]: It's flown by really quickly.

5
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:00,111
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of great music featuring students and professionals from around the area.

6
00:03:00,592 --> 00:03:02,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you I haven't met, my name is Jonathan Fagan.

7
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:07,953
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a composer, educator, pianist, but I've been producing this for about five years now.

8
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:11,194
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year in particular, we've just had a lot of help.

9
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,115
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few thank yous before I turn it over to this amazing band.

10
00:03:15,065 --> 00:03:18,706
[SPEAKER_00]: First to the West Medford Community Center, historic space.

11
00:03:19,206 --> 00:03:22,947
[SPEAKER_00]: We were showing some of the performers around inside earlier, and there's a lot there.

12
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:27,148
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of history, a lot of amazing artists who have come from this place.

13
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:34,350
[SPEAKER_00]: So in between sets, I really hope you'll go inside, take advantage of the Danish Pastry House, who has set up headquarters there.

14
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,731
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been eating a lot of it, and everything just keeps getting better.

15
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:39,291
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.

16
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:42,852
[SPEAKER_00]: So also to the Arts Alive Foundation, Medford Foundation.

17
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:51,549
[SPEAKER_00]: They've really helped us financial support Morningside Music Studio, the Medford Arts Council, Triangle Manor.

18
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:59,115
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some beautiful t-shirts up there with two of our volunteers who are also involved in eating Danish pastry house at the moment.

19
00:03:59,836 --> 00:04:06,021
[SPEAKER_00]: And Berkeley's Institute of Jazz for Gender Justice, which is where this band is from.

20
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:07,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard them playing a little earlier.

21
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:08,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounded incredible.

22
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:22,320
[SPEAKER_00]: Terry will tell you more about the history later, but it's a beautiful way of bringing that program full circle with where Terry Lynn Carrington, who's a legendary drummer from around here, really got her start, which was here.

23
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,483
[SPEAKER_00]: And her parents are still involved in this community.

24
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:33,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you also to our Patreon members, who are folks just like you, put in a couple dollars a month.

25
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:38,612
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps us pay for things like jam sessions, for the actual festival itself.

26
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:42,466
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, it's really added up in a meaningful way.

27
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:49,652
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking to get involved, there are numerous QR codes that you can scan to find out more about that.

28
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:54,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, the people working the cameras, Medford Community Media, you all, you three have gone above and beyond.

29
00:04:54,796 --> 00:05:00,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking at least one camera would be great, but now we have three.

30
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:04,424
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, it's great to get high quality video.

31
00:05:04,624 --> 00:05:07,667
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also being live streamed for those who couldn't be here in person.

32
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:17,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, to the Winchester Community Music School, to EXP Realty, and to Staples for our wonderful programs here.

33
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:34,143
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you, of course, to our volunteers and staff, to Shayla, my partner, who's done basically everything, to Reese and Eva up there, the tables, and to Bruce, who's been also stepping in and doing just about everything.

34
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:41,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll turn it over to Terry Carter, who manages many different things here at the Community Center.

35
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:45,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the former Poet Laureate of Medford, has written a lot of stuff.

36
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:51,617
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of you saw him yesterday as part of our project, the Ally Project, but really couldn't do this without him.

37
00:05:52,078 --> 00:05:55,760
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going to tell you a little more about this band and about the space.

38
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:00,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.

39
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,023
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cute.

40
00:06:02,156 --> 00:06:05,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me just take you through where we've been so far.

41
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:09,481
[SPEAKER_04]: So on Friday night, we started out with a student night.

42
00:06:09,521 --> 00:06:15,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very interesting because most of the students were of the older, more mature variety.

43
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:20,287
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're from Morningside Music School.

44
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:23,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And they put together two different bands.

45
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were fantastic, phenomenal, and quite delightful.

46
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:29,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Anita Wood came.

47
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:30,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Anita came.

48
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:36,854
[SPEAKER_04]: from Medford, not originally from Medford, but grew up a good portion of her childhood here.

49
00:06:37,254 --> 00:06:39,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And she brought her band, it was called A.J.

50
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:42,117
[SPEAKER_04]: and the Groove, and they were similarly wonderful.

51
00:06:42,197 --> 00:06:43,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was night one.

52
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:56,063
[SPEAKER_04]: And then yesterday afternoon, we started out with Brazilian Flavor with Receita de Samba featuring Anna Borges and Bill Ward, and they were smoking hot.

53
00:06:57,342 --> 00:07:07,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, as Jonathan said, the Ally Project, featuring myself and Jonathan, Greg Toro, and great drummer Gordon Engelgau, we finished up.

54
00:07:08,164 --> 00:07:20,387
[SPEAKER_04]: So today, we're into a new groove, and it's Berklee's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, under the leadership of Terry Lynn Carrington.

55
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:24,428
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have, from the Institute,

56
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,012
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Jan Portish on bass.

57
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:31,915
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's got the big sexy today, all right?

58
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:35,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the biggest bass you're gonna see this weekend.

59
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:37,820
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have Eugene Han on piano.

60
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:39,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

61
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:43,224
[SPEAKER_04]: My man in yellow here, Fall Ray on sax.

62
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

63
00:07:45,485 --> 00:07:50,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And on drums, Ivana Cuesta.

64
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:56,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and I just want to say a word about Ivana Cuesta, a feature of the group.

65
00:07:56,963 --> 00:08:07,749
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a drummer, she's a composer, she's an educator from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and she's known for her powerful artistry and ability to blend diverse musical traditions.

66
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:08,569
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see all this.

67
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:20,896
[SPEAKER_04]: She holds degrees from Dominican Republic Music Conservatory and Berkeley College of Music, where she studied with well-known artists, including Neil Smith, the aforementioned Terry Lynn Carrington,

68
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Francisco Mela and others.

69
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,620
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a compelling live performer.

70
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,580
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna see all this.

71
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:32,284
[SPEAKER_04]: And she is leading up a band that really, really smokes.

72
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:35,626
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna get out the way and let them do what they do.

73
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:45,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to day three of the Medford Jazz Festival at the historic West Medford Community Center.

74
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:47,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen,

75
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:53,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Ivana Cuesta and the Berklee Institute of Jazz for Gender Justice.

76
00:08:54,417 --> 00:08:55,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Let them do their thing.

77
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:01,487
[SPEAKER_02]: do do

78
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:37,216
[SPEAKER_02]: do do do

79
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:02,805
[SPEAKER_02]: do do

80
00:14:11,257 --> 00:14:11,758
[SPEAKER_02]: do

81
00:16:24,046 --> 00:16:24,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

82
00:16:25,868 --> 00:16:26,669
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guys.

83
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:29,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having us.

84
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,913
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure for us to be here.

85
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:32,655
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an amazing place.

86
00:16:32,675 --> 00:16:35,377
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my first time here, and maybe all of you, right?

87
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:36,579
[SPEAKER_01]: First time?

88
00:16:36,619 --> 00:16:36,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

89
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,462
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for the invitation.

90
00:16:40,963 --> 00:16:53,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Terri said before, my name is Ivana Cuesta, and I'm part of the Justice Institute, led by Terri Lee Carrington.

91
00:16:53,575 --> 00:17:03,204
[SPEAKER_01]: And the music that we want to breathe today is music composed by women, but also non-binary people.

92
00:17:03,665 --> 00:17:05,447
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we want to try to do is

93
00:17:07,308 --> 00:17:12,071
[SPEAKER_01]: just bring something that sometimes is not well recognized, I would say, in the music industry.

94
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:16,693
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why, yeah, we just choose really nice tunes.

95
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:21,676
[SPEAKER_01]: But also from some, actually from some of our professors.

96
00:17:22,496 --> 00:17:26,879
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first tune that we play, it's called Chaos.

97
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:33,043
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my tunes that I wrote, I think, two years ago.

98
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:35,605
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in my album, Alert to the Earth.

99
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:42,130
[SPEAKER_01]: So you maybe had the sense it was a little bit chaotic, and really loud, and really noisy.

100
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,691
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was how I actually felt.

101
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,713
[SPEAKER_01]: the pandemic ends.

102
00:17:48,173 --> 00:17:55,678
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think everyone probably wrote a music, a song or something after pandemic because it was really something that affect all of us.

103
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:01,902
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next tune that we're gonna be playing is Kowtow by Caroline Davis.

104
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:03,483
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoy it.

105
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:35,571
uh uh

106
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,150

[SPEAKER_07]: So, again, thank you very much.

[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay, perfect.

[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so the last one that we're gonna do is called Smoking Gun, and it's by a saxophone player, like I said, Diane Stevens.

[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanna say thank you so much, everyone.

00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:36,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, guys.

147
01:05:10,194 --> 01:05:12,636
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why you have engineers, because that's regular people.

148
01:05:12,656 --> 01:05:14,417
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know where the heck we are on stage.

149
01:05:15,317 --> 01:05:39,292
[SPEAKER_04]: In any case, ladies and gentlemen, Berklee's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, featuring Ivana Cuesta on bass, Jan Portisch on the keyboards, Yujin Han, and on the saxophone, big and little, Fall Ray.

150
01:05:41,253 --> 01:05:41,693
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

151
01:05:42,774 --> 01:05:45,937
[SPEAKER_04]: It has indeed been a pleasure to hear y'all play.

152
01:05:45,957 --> 01:05:47,639
[SPEAKER_04]: You're wonderful.

153
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:53,905
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to send a thank you note to Terry Lynn for releasing y'all to come over and hang out with us for an afternoon.

154

[SPEAKER_11]: Where does the party roll and the girls dance?

158
01:08:53,858 --> 01:08:57,000

01:51:02,744 --> 01:51:07,388
[SPEAKER_08]: How many are still searching for it?

190
01:51:07,868 --> 01:51:11,110
[SPEAKER_08]: To the point where my Lord is always quivering.

191
01:51:11,431 --> 01:51:15,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Claire, how are you?

192

01:51:22,534 --> 01:51:24,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not even emotionally real.

We are

272
01:57:11,203 --> 01:57:13,145
A thought of reminiscing.

273
01:57:13,265 --> 01:57:15,867
And I'll never forget you.

274
01:57:16,327 --> 01:57:20,710
And I'll never forget you.

275
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:23,812
And I'll never forget you.

you

277
01:58:28,613 --> 01:58:28,693
So,

278
01:59:12,601 --> 01:59:22,302
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the best time for me when I have musicians and calling out tunes and we all know them.

279
02:00:33,810 --> 02:00:36,533
[SPEAKER_09]: You just now figured it out, lady!

280
02:03:19,592 --> 02:03:20,994
Music playing

281
02:04:31,835 --> 02:04:33,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody knows that song, right?

282
02:04:34,417 --> 02:04:37,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody knew that song before I met you here.

283
02:04:37,981 --> 02:04:42,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so do me a favor and don't ever go back and actually listen to what the song was like.

284
02:04:42,945 --> 02:04:49,351
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna be like, she didn't do it the way Donna did it.

285
02:04:49,732 --> 02:04:55,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I will have ruined it for you for every correct version because that was some scum.

286
02:05:41,728 --> 02:06:03,792
[SPEAKER_08]: ♪ I must find a way ♪ ♪ And I have found the only way for me ♪ ♪ I don't believe in threatening grief ♪ ♪ What I mess around with is fright ♪

287
02:08:49,952 --> 02:08:50,053
Bye!

288
02:10:56,357 --> 02:11:05,686
[SPEAKER_08]: I pray for everyone here today and all the people who are listening in the atmosphere to have a simple today and a simple tomorrow and hopefully a simple week coming up.

289
02:11:06,447 --> 02:11:12,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever is stressing you, whatever is complicating your spirit and got it all twisted up,

290
02:11:28,999 --> 02:11:29,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Listen to Joe.

291
02:12:58,128 --> 02:12:58,788
[SPEAKER_02]: do do

292
02:15:36,889 --> 02:15:37,893

you

294
02:19:41,495 --> 02:19:42,396
[SPEAKER_08]: He just made that up.

295
02:19:43,477 --> 02:19:45,900
[SPEAKER_08]: And I took his lead because I followed him wherever he goes.

296
02:19:58,875 --> 02:20:00,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody smell pollen?

297
02:20:25,634 --> 02:20:25,695
[SPEAKER_07]: you

298
02:21:14,970 --> 02:21:15,030
you

299
02:24:39,049 --> 02:24:39,111
you

300
02:25:51,666 --> 02:25:51,727
you

301
02:27:09,709 --> 02:27:10,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I mention that I write?

302
02:27:12,752 --> 02:27:17,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so forgive us, we're going to subject you to a couple of my songs, alright?

303
02:27:20,339 --> 02:27:22,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I promise, you won't die.

304
02:27:25,384 --> 02:27:26,786
[SPEAKER_08]: And there will be no polling.

305
02:28:12,306 --> 02:28:12,426
do

306
02:28:57,085 --> 02:28:57,286
you

307
02:30:43,472 --> 02:30:43,533
you

308
02:31:08,847 --> 02:31:12,311
[SPEAKER_08]: do do do do do do do do do do do do do

309
02:32:03,452 --> 02:32:07,033
[SPEAKER_08]: A rabbit, 60 mile an hour winds.

310
02:32:07,173 --> 02:32:09,333
[SPEAKER_08]: No raging fire to put out.

311
02:32:09,353 --> 02:32:13,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a smoldering ember within.

312
02:32:14,674 --> 02:32:16,474
[SPEAKER_08]: No drawn out recitation.

313
02:32:17,215 --> 02:32:19,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Just three little words to say.

314
02:32:19,855 --> 02:32:22,396
Just your smile.

315
02:32:22,456 --> 02:32:26,836
[SPEAKER_08]: No dozen roses, box of candles.

316
02:32:31,937 --> 02:32:33,337
[SPEAKER_08]: couldn't eat that anyway.

317
02:32:35,318 --> 02:32:41,100

[SPEAKER_08]: Just your smile.

321
02:32:53,404 --> 02:32:58,945
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't need a moon or the glow.

322
02:32:58,985 --> 02:33:01,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Hear trumpets, choirs, or strings.

323
02:33:02,754 --> 02:33:29,255
[SPEAKER_08]: ♪ That it'd be too soon to know anyway ♪ ♪ Who answers when that bell rings ♪ ♪ Yet I knew when I looked into your eyes ♪ ♪ My lonely days were through ♪ ♪ And all the fireworks and rockets in the world ♪ ♪ Couldn't make it any more true that no bells ♪ ♪ Could warn me of my pending fall, no clue ♪

324
02:33:30,851 --> 02:33:35,493
[SPEAKER_08]: That this would be the sweetest dream of all.

325
02:33:35,853 --> 02:33:37,774

[SPEAKER_08]: No 14-day vacation.

329
02:33:47,419 --> 02:33:56,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to live my days on just your smile.

330
02:33:57,524 --> 02:33:59,325
[SPEAKER_08]: You got me loving, loving, loving.

331
02:34:02,623 --> 02:34:04,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Just three little words to say.

332
02:34:07,967 --> 02:34:10,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Marry me, baby.

333
02:34:12,751 --> 02:34:14,312

358
02:35:51,675 --> 02:35:58,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I wrote it back in the days of the assault on Rodney King.

359
02:35:59,481 --> 02:36:03,304
[SPEAKER_08]: They did the interview with him and he asked, why can't we just get along?

360
02:36:04,565 --> 02:36:07,948
[SPEAKER_08]: And right after that, this song came on my heart.

361
02:36:08,849 --> 02:36:10,330
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, how many years ago was that?

362
02:36:11,697 --> 02:36:18,662
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of years, so this song has been really 30 years, 34 years.

363
02:36:19,883 --> 02:36:38,137
[SPEAKER_08]: So this song is still living and it's still reasonable to plead with the heavens and to plead with everyone around you.

382
02:39:02,204 --> 02:39:04,526
[SPEAKER_08]: It's more than a notion.

383
02:39:04,546 --> 02:39:11,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's take a stand in the caring hand.

02:53:08,191 --> 02:53:08,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

481
02:53:12,634 --> 02:53:13,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Acapella.

482
02:53:18,559 --> 02:53:19,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at me.

483
02:53:23,711 --> 02:53:29,514
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree.

484
02:53:29,894 --> 02:53:31,055
[SPEAKER_08]: You can join in if you want to.

485
02:53:31,475 --> 02:53:34,916
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like I'm clinging to a cloud.

486
02:53:35,577 --> 02:53:38,418
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't understand.

487
02:53:39,118 --> 02:53:44,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I get misty just holding your hand.

488
02:53:44,480 --> 02:53:46,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I move up a half step or a down step?

489
02:53:49,743 --> 02:53:52,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Walk my way.

490
02:53:55,235 --> 02:54:02,179
[SPEAKER_08]: And a thousand violins begin to play.

491
02:54:03,020 --> 02:54:06,842
[SPEAKER_08]: And it might be the sound of your hello.

492
02:54:08,103 --> 02:54:18,789
[SPEAKER_08]: The music I hear gets me misty the moment you're near.

493
02:54:22,931 --> 02:54:31,980
[SPEAKER_08]: You can say that you're leading me on.

494
02:54:33,021 --> 02:54:37,686
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just what I want you, I want you to do.

495
02:54:39,528 --> 02:54:44,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost?

496
02:54:46,848 --> 02:55:14,312
[SPEAKER_08]: ♪ That's why I'm following you, baby ♪ ♪ You better believe me ♪ ♪ On my own ♪ ♪ Must I wander through this wonderland alone ♪ ♪ Never knowing my right foot from my left ♪

497
02:55:15,922 --> 02:55:19,464
[SPEAKER_08]: My hat from my glove.

498
02:55:21,025 --> 02:55:31,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm too misty and too much in love.

499
02:55:32,032 --> 02:55:39,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so misty and too much in.

500
02:56:02,038 --> 02:56:02,879
[SPEAKER_08]: God bless you all.

501
02:56:03,479 --> 02:56:04,400
[SPEAKER_08]: See you next time.

502
02:56:04,820 --> 02:56:06,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a great rest of the day.

503
02:56:06,902 --> 02:56:07,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

504
02:56:26,576 --> 02:56:30,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, one more time for the inimitable Donna McElroy.

505
02:56:31,643 --> 02:56:32,063
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

506
02:56:33,064 --> 02:56:38,407
[SPEAKER_04]: On the keys, the equally inestimable George W. Russell Jr.

507
02:56:39,588 --> 02:56:43,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of us who have known him for a long, long time can call him G-Dub.

508
02:56:43,930 --> 02:56:44,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get twisted.

509
02:56:45,651 --> 02:56:46,091
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

510
02:56:46,712 --> 02:56:49,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Big man, big bass, big sexy, Sean Farias.

511
02:56:54,136 --> 02:56:57,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know you got to give the drummer some, it's Sean Skeet.

512
02:56:59,203 --> 02:57:04,944
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, you heard it here live and in living color at the West Medford Community Center.

513
02:57:05,325 --> 02:57:06,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Terry Codd.

514
02:57:06,645 --> 02:57:07,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been your genial host.

515
02:57:08,065 --> 02:57:10,146
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to bring my main man, Jonathan Fagan.

516
02:57:10,186 --> 02:57:11,846
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going to do thanks and acknowledgments.

517
02:57:12,146 --> 02:57:16,387
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been a lovely audience, and we've enjoyed you just as much as you've enjoyed us.

518
02:57:20,508 --> 02:57:21,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, everyone.

519
02:57:21,649 --> 02:57:22,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there we go.

520
02:57:23,670 --> 02:57:32,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again so much to the West Medford Community Center for hosting us all weekend, especially to our MC, Master of Ceremonies, Terry Carter over here.

521
02:57:33,573 --> 02:57:38,934
[SPEAKER_00]: To the Danish Pastry House over here, elevated the event to another level.

522
02:57:39,614 --> 02:57:41,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Please go in and grab something on your way out.

523
02:57:42,815 --> 02:57:51,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to our volunteers and our staff, to Shayla, to Reese, Eva, all the folks working sound and video over there, Medford Community Media.

524
02:57:53,258 --> 02:57:56,220
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you most of all to our musicians, this wonderful band.

525
02:57:56,280 --> 02:57:58,941
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to all leave here inspired and moved.

526
02:57:59,081 --> 02:58:05,724
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for coming and just, you know, blessing us with your talents.

527
02:58:05,905 --> 02:58:09,706
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for more from the Medford Jazz Festival.

528
02:58:09,967 --> 02:58:19,491
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel inspired to, drop a couple dollars in the donation box or scan a QR code on your way out and sign up for our email list if you'd like to know what we're up to.

529
02:58:19,572 --> 02:58:22,393
[SPEAKER_00]: We hope to keep many things going throughout the year.

530
02:58:23,503 --> 02:58:25,045
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right, have a great afternoon.
