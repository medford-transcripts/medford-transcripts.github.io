All right, welcome everybody to day three of the Medford Jazz Festival. For those of you I haven't, yeah, I know. It's amazing. It's flown by really quickly. We've had a lot of great music featuring students and professionals from around the area. Those of you I haven't met, my name is Jonathan Fagan. I'm a composer, educator, pianist, but I've been producing this for about five years now. And this year in particular, we've just had a lot of help. So a few thank yous before I turn it over to this amazing band.

2
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:43,692
First to the West Medford Community Center, historic space. We were showing some of the performers around inside earlier, and there's a lot there. There's a lot of history, a lot of amazing artists who have come from this place. So in between sets, I really hope you'll go inside, take advantage of the Danish Pastry House, who has set up headquarters there. I've been eating a lot of it, and everything just keeps getting better. It's amazing. So also to the Arts Alive Foundation, Medford Foundation.

3
00:03:44,603 --> 00:04:10,405
They've really helped us financial support Morningside Music Studio, the Medford Arts Council, Triangle Manor. We've got some beautiful t-shirts up there with two of our volunteers who are also involved in eating Danish pastry house at the moment. And Berkeley's Institute of Jazz for Gender Justice, which is where this band is from. I heard them playing a little earlier. Sounded incredible.

4
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:39,633
Terry will tell you more about the history later, but it's a beautiful way of bringing that program full circle with where Terry Lynn Carrington, who's a legendary drummer from around here, really got her start, which was here. And her parents are still involved in this community. Thank you also to our Patreon members, who are folks just like you, put in a couple dollars a month. It helps us pay for things like jam sessions, for the actual festival itself.

5
00:04:40,004 --> 00:05:07,747
Over the years, it's really added up in a meaningful way. So if you're looking to get involved, there are numerous QR codes that you can scan to find out more about that. Two, the people working the cameras, Medford Community Media, you all, you three have gone above and beyond. I was thinking at least one camera would be great, but now we have three. So it's really, it's great to get high quality video. This is also being live streamed for those who couldn't be here in person.

6
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:35,084
Lastly, to the Winchester Community Music School, to EXP Realty, and to Staples for our wonderful programs here. And thank you, of course, to our volunteers and staff, to Shayla, my partner, who's done basically everything, to Reese and Eva up there, the tables, and to Bruce, who's been also stepping in and doing just about everything.

7
00:05:35,708 --> 00:06:01,223
Now I'll turn it over to Terry Carter, who manages many different things here at the Community Center. Also the former Poet Laureate of Medford, has written a lot of stuff. I know some of you saw him yesterday as part of our project, the Ally Project, but really couldn't do this without him. And he's going to tell you a little more about this band and about the space. I love that. That's cute.

8
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:31,514
So let me just take you through where we've been so far. So on Friday night, we started out with a student night. And it's very interesting because most of the students were of the older, more mature variety. And they're from Morningside Music School. And they put together two different bands. And they were fantastic, phenomenal, and quite delightful. And then Anita Wood came. Anita came.

9
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:56,523
from Medford, not originally from Medford, but grew up a good portion of her childhood here. And she brought her band, it was called A.J. and the Groove, and they were similarly wonderful. So that was night one. And then yesterday afternoon, we started out with Brazilian Flavor with Receita de Samba featuring Anna Borges and Bill Ward, and they were smoking hot.

10
00:06:56,962 --> 00:07:24,468
And then, as Jonathan said, the Ally Project, featuring myself and Jonathan, Greg Toro, and great drummer Gordon Engelgau, we finished up. So today, we're into a new groove, and it's Berklee's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, under the leadership of Terry Lynn Carrington. And we have, from the Institute,

11
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:50,489
We have Jan Portish on bass. And he's got the big sexy today, all right? So that's the biggest bass you're gonna see this weekend. And we have Eugene Han on piano. Okay. My man in yellow here, Fall Ray on sax. Okay. And on drums, Ivana Cuesta.

12
00:07:51,400 --> 00:08:21,016
Okay, and I just want to say a word about Ivana Cuesta, a feature of the group. She's a drummer, she's a composer, she's an educator from Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and she's known for her powerful artistry and ability to blend diverse musical traditions. You'll see all this. She holds degrees from Dominican Republic Music Conservatory and Berkeley College of Music, where she studied with well-known artists, including Neil Smith, the aforementioned Terry Lynn Carrington,

13
00:08:21,337 --> 00:08:48,033
Francisco Mela and others. She's a compelling live performer. You're gonna see all this. And she is leading up a band that really, really smokes. So I'm gonna get out the way and let them do what they do. Welcome to day three of the Medford Jazz Festival at the historic West Medford Community Center. Ladies and gentlemen,

14
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:55,238
Ivana Cuesta and the Berklee Institute of Jazz for Gender Justice. Let them do their thing.

Great. Hey, guys. Thank you for having us. It's a pleasure for us to be here. This is an amazing place. It's my first time here, and maybe all of you, right? First time? Yeah. So thank you so much for the invitation.

26
00:16:40,803 --> 00:17:06,908
Like Terri said before, my name is Ivana Cuesta, and I'm part of the Justice Institute, led by Terri Lee Carrington. And the music that we want to breathe today is music composed by women, but also non-binary people. So what we want to try to do is

27
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:22,096
just bring something that sometimes is not well recognized, I would say, in the music industry. So that's why, yeah, we just choose really nice tunes. But also from some, actually from some of our professors.

28
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:45,772
So the first tune that we play, it's called Chaos. It's one of my tunes that I wrote, I think, two years ago. And it's in my album, Alert to the Earth. So you maybe had the sense it was a little bit chaotic, and really loud, and really noisy. But that was how I actually felt.

29
00:17:46,092 --> 00:18:03,743
the pandemic ends. So I think everyone probably wrote a music, a song or something after pandemic because it was really something that affect all of us. So the next tune that we're gonna be playing is Kowtow by Caroline Davis. I hope you enjoy it.

Yeah, okay, perfect. Well, so the last one that we're gonna do is called Smoking Gun, and it's by a saxophone player, like I said, Diane Stevens. And I just wanna say thank you so much, everyone. I wanna say thanks to the organizers, thanks to Jonathan, Abby, Terry, and everyone, actually, for having us. It's a pleasure, and I hope we can come back

This is called Why Can't We Live Together. I wrote it back in the days of the assault on Rodney King. They did the interview with him and he asked, why can't we just get along? And right after that, this song came on my heart. And now, how many years ago was that?

148
02:36:11,697 --> 02:36:39,878
