    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=14.585s">Good</a>  morning, Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=16.746s">This</a>  is a screen recording to demonstrate how you would connect your MacBook to a networked printer at Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=26.793s">Typically</a>  these will be photocopiers that are housed in your building. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=31.415s">So</a>  the first thing you wanna do is you wanna make sure that you are connected to the MPS staff network. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=38.34s">So</a>  you go up and you'll click the Wi-Fi icon. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=42.622s">in</a>  the top right-hand corner of your screen, and you'll select the MPS staff network. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=48.868s">All</a>  of your devices should default normally to this, but just in case, you want to make sure that you're on that staff network. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=56.889s">Then</a>  in your dock, this is the technical name for this at the bottom of your screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=64.21s">In</a>  the dock, you wanna find the system preferences icon. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=67.871s">Once</a>  again, that is in the dock, the system preferences icon, and you wanna double click or single click that, however you have your MacBook set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=77.813s">Now,</a>  there are two ways to find the printers and scanners. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=80.974s">You</a>  can simply locate the icon, which is located here in the third row of the system preferences, <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=86.915s">Or</a>  you can go up here and you can type in printers and that will show you highlighted two areas where you want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=96.951s">This</a>  is the one you want in this icon. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=102.082s">So</a>  double-click printers. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=104.603s">You'll</a>  notice that we have a number of printers here set up already. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=110.866s">The</a>  top one is my home network printer. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=114.387s">This</a>  is the photocopier in the buildings and grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=118.329s">And</a>  then this is the printer in the superintendent's office, the photocopier. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=125.109s">Now,</a>  looking down here in the lower left hand portion of this dialog bubble, you'll notice that there's a plus and a minus sign when you hover over those dialog boxes pop up and you get a click here to add a printer. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=143.806s">fax</a>  or scanner and you get a minus sign here to delete a printer or scanner. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=150.27s">And</a>  so if you click the delete button, you'll be able to delete a printer. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=154.212s">I'm</a>  going to cancel that because that is not the one I want to delete. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=158.074s">I'm</a>  going to delete the Medford Public Schools buildings and grounds right now, delete printer. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=164.138s">And</a>  now we're going to go back in and we're going to select the plus sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=168.58s">So</a>  click the plus to add a printer. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=171.937s">And</a>  as you scroll through, you can see that I have access on the local network here for all of the Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School printers, photocopiers that are networked. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=185.645s">And</a>  you'll see that they have pupil services, <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=190.227s">We</a>  have Medford Family Network listed, library, library lounge, and then various rooms that they're connected into. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=199.631s">Now</a>  I'm gonna reselect and highlight, that's a single click of the MHS buildings and grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=206.874s">And</a>  then I'm gonna go down here to the lower right-hand corner and click this add button. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=212.536s">So</a>  click add. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=213.776s">And</a>  now it's setting up Medford High School buildings and grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=219.127s">And</a>  now that once again is a printer that I have access to. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=223.129s">Now</a>  to show you how this will look in your realm of printing, I'm gonna click Google Chrome. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=232.012s">It's</a>  gonna select which profile I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=234.373s">I'm</a>  going to use this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=236.974s">And</a>  I'm gonna go to a letter that I recently sent to all secondary staff, which is the faculty and staff welcome back letter.</p>

    <p>[John McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=245.978s">There</a>  we go.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=257.995s">All</a>  right, now that has loaded and I can click print, hover over and print, but I want to make sure that I have the right printer selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=266.297s">So</a>  I'm going to go up to file and I'm going to scroll down to, let me just move this picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=272.338s">I'm</a>  not sure if you can see that, but let me go down here to print and I'm going to click print. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=281.486s">And</a>  right here, all right, it lists MHS BNG because I had previously loaded it. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=290.432s">What</a>  you'll need to do the first time you've loaded a printer is click the see more button. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=296.255s">And</a>  so you'll click see more, and you'll see that I have saved as a PDF my home printer. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=304.088s">MHS</a>  buildings and grounds and MHS super secretary, secretary's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=310.511s">So</a>  for now, let's just click this one and you'll notice that it changes up here, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=317.114s">And</a>  I am now able to print, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=320.475s">So</a>  if I click print, that will print out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=325.39s">Now</a>  this is just a quick video to get you started on printing. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=332.195s">One</a>  other little additional item that I think might be helpful to faculty and staff, I know that many of you have been using the MacBooks for the better part of a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=340.982s">So</a>  let me close this out and I'm gonna go back using the back button in the system preferences box. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=351.206s">and</a>  that's right up here, the back and the forward button. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=353.548s">So</a>  if I click the forward button, it will bring me back to printers, but I wanna go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=357.87s">You</a>  can also click this button, this grid button, and it'll bring you back to the whole grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=363.174s">The</a>  trackpad on a MacBook is set up differently than a trackpad or a mouse on a PC. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=370.839s">And</a>  so if you wanna get the right-click option, which makes it feel more like a PC, you wanna double-click the trackpad, <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=379.11s">And</a>  by double-clicking the trackpad, you'll notice right up here in the top left-hand corner, I have my secondary click as the bottom right corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=390.036s">I'm</a>  gonna deselect that, and that is generally speaking how the MacBooks are set up, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=395.999s">Now,</a>  your MacBook may already be set up this way, but what you wanna do is you wanna then select that, <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=403.851s">and</a>  then click in the bottom right corner is where I like my second click to be because it simulates or mimics a MacBook, I'm sorry, a typical PC mouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=416.343s">And</a>  so now I'm now set up to right click. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=420.066s">This</a>  has been a quick video to show you setting up a district printer. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=425.731s">And</a>  I thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=427.733s">If</a>  you have any questions, feel free to email myself, Molly Laden, Alan Arena, and I'll be happy to work through it with you personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=438.283s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/YmO-36LceWQ&t=439.384s">And</a>  I hope you guys have an absolutely</p>
