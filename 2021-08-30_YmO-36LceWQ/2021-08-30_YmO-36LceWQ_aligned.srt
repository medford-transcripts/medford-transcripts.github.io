00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:16,266
Good morning, Medford Public Schools.

2
00:00:16,746 --> 00:00:26,532
This is a screen recording to demonstrate how you would connect your MacBook to a networked printer at Medford Public Schools.

3
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:30,895
Typically these will be photocopiers that are housed in your building.

4
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:37,779
So the first thing you wanna do is you wanna make sure that you are connected to the MPS staff network.

5
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,402
So you go up and you'll click the Wi-Fi icon.

6
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:48,307
in the top right-hand corner of your screen, and you'll select the MPS staff network.

7
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:55,874
All of your devices should default normally to this, but just in case, you want to make sure that you're on that staff network.

8
00:00:56,889 --> 00:01:03,430
Then in your dock, this is the technical name for this at the bottom of your screen.

9
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,731
In the dock, you wanna find the system preferences icon.

10
00:01:07,871 --> 00:01:17,193
Once again, that is in the dock, the system preferences icon, and you wanna double click or single click that, however you have your MacBook set up.

11
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:20,954
Now, there are two ways to find the printers and scanners.

12
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:26,175
You can simply locate the icon, which is located here in the third row of the system preferences,

13
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:36,931
Or you can go up here and you can type in printers and that will show you highlighted two areas where you want to go.

14
00:01:36,951 --> 00:01:40,957
This is the one you want in this icon.

15
00:01:42,082 --> 00:01:43,583
So double-click printers.

16
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:50,685
You'll notice that we have a number of printers here set up already.

17
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:53,106
The top one is my home network printer.

18
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:58,088
This is the photocopier in the buildings and grounds.

19
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:04,111
And then this is the printer in the superintendent's office, the photocopier.

20
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:22,598
Now, looking down here in the lower left hand portion of this dialog bubble, you'll notice that there's a plus and a minus sign when you hover over those dialog boxes pop up and you get a click here to add a printer.

21
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:30,090
fax or scanner and you get a minus sign here to delete a printer or scanner.

22
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,032
And so if you click the delete button, you'll be able to delete a printer.

23
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:37,494
I'm going to cancel that because that is not the one I want to delete.

24
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:43,097
I'm going to delete the Medford Public Schools buildings and grounds right now, delete printer.

25
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:48,360
And now we're going to go back in and we're going to select the plus sign.

26
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,782
So click the plus to add a printer.

27
00:02:51,937 --> 00:03:04,524
And as you scroll through, you can see that I have access on the local network here for all of the Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School printers, photocopiers that are networked.

28
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:08,886
And you'll see that they have pupil services,

29
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:18,891
We have Medford Family Network listed, library, library lounge, and then various rooms that they're connected into.

30
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:26,073
Now I'm gonna reselect and highlight, that's a single click of the MHS buildings and grounds.

31
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:32,196
And then I'm gonna go down here to the lower right-hand corner and click this add button.

32
00:03:32,536 --> 00:03:33,316
So click add.

33
00:03:33,776 --> 00:03:37,678
And now it's setting up Medford High School buildings and grounds.

34
00:03:39,127 --> 00:03:42,889
And now that once again is a printer that I have access to.

35
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:51,212
Now to show you how this will look in your realm of printing, I'm gonna click Google Chrome.

36
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,213
It's gonna select which profile I want.

37
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:55,814
I'm going to use this one.

38
00:03:56,974 --> 00:04:05,958
And I'm gonna go to a letter that I recently sent to all secondary staff, which is the faculty and staff welcome back letter.

39
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:08,279
There we go.

40
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:25,737
All right, now that has loaded and I can click print, hover over and print, but I want to make sure that I have the right printer selected.

41
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:32,318
So I'm going to go up to file and I'm going to scroll down to, let me just move this picture.

42
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:39,740
I'm not sure if you can see that, but let me go down here to print and I'm going to click print.

43
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:50,231
And right here, all right, it lists MHS BNG because I had previously loaded it.

44
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:55,855
What you'll need to do the first time you've loaded a printer is click the see more button.

45
00:04:56,255 --> 00:05:02,479
And so you'll click see more, and you'll see that I have saved as a PDF my home printer.

46
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:09,911
MHS buildings and grounds and MHS super secretary, secretary's office.

47
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:16,214
So for now, let's just click this one and you'll notice that it changes up here, right?

48
00:05:17,114 --> 00:05:20,415
And I am now able to print, right?

49
00:05:20,475 --> 00:05:23,457
So if I click print, that will print out there.

50
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:30,794
Now this is just a quick video to get you started on printing.

51
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:40,342
One other little additional item that I think might be helpful to faculty and staff, I know that many of you have been using the MacBooks for the better part of a year.

52
00:05:40,982 --> 00:05:50,229
So let me close this out and I'm gonna go back using the back button in the system preferences box.

53
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:53,528
and that's right up here, the back and the forward button.

54
00:05:53,548 --> 00:05:57,490
So if I click the forward button, it will bring me back to printers, but I wanna go back.

55
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,813
You can also click this button, this grid button, and it'll bring you back to the whole grid.

56
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:10,138
The trackpad on a MacBook is set up differently than a trackpad or a mouse on a PC.

57
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:18,064
And so if you wanna get the right-click option, which makes it feel more like a PC, you wanna double-click the trackpad,

58
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:29,996
And by double-clicking the trackpad, you'll notice right up here in the top left-hand corner, I have my secondary click as the bottom right corner.

59
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:35,459
I'm gonna deselect that, and that is generally speaking how the MacBooks are set up, all right?

60
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:42,743
Now, your MacBook may already be set up this way, but what you wanna do is you wanna then select that,

61
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:54,201
and then click in the bottom right corner is where I like my second click to be because it simulates or mimics a MacBook, I'm sorry, a typical PC mouse.

62
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:58,745
And so now I'm now set up to right click.

63
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:04,870
This has been a quick video to show you setting up a district printer.

64
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:07,333
And I thank you for your time.

65
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:17,562
If you have any questions, feel free to email myself, Molly Laden, Alan Arena, and I'll be happy to work through it with you personally.

66
00:07:18,283 --> 00:07:18,963
Thank you very much.

67
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:21,386
And I hope you guys have an absolutely
