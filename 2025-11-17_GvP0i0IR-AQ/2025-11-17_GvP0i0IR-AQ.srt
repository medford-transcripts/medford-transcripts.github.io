1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:00,231
[SPEAKER_06]: there.

2
00:00:01,272 --> 00:00:01,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I will get it.

3
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,753
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking it up right now.

4
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:03,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?

5
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:13,562
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you find that approval grants approval of field trips approval of meeting minutes from our regular meeting on October 20th 2025.

6
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:17,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Assuming that's still in the 13,000 range, but I'll

7
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:53,234
[SPEAKER_08]: $13,251.18.

8
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:53,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, is there a motion for approval with that amendment to correct the dollar figure for the grants from the Medford Education Foundation?

9
00:00:55,316 --> 00:00:55,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

10
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion for approval, seconded by a member in Tapa.

11
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:04,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't catch who moved the motion.

12
00:01:05,493 --> 00:01:05,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Reinfeld.

13
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:07,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you did members.

00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:10,957

[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

29
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:30,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

30
00:01:30,545 --> 00:01:32,527
[SPEAKER_08]: The consent agenda is approved.

31
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,193
[SPEAKER_08]: We have no reports of subcommittees.

32
00:01:37,393 --> 00:01:40,337
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have multiple reports from our superintendent.

33
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:42,239
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to turn it over to you, Dr. Galusi.

34
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,761
[SPEAKER_08]: First up is the Mustang moment.

35
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:45,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

36
00:01:45,544 --> 00:01:51,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, this evening we have some students from the Andrews with their principal, Ms.

37
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:51,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Skane.

38
00:01:52,550 --> 00:02:03,399
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not, I, Principal Skane, I believe will handle the introductions and then we will pass it over to the students who are going to present about some advocacy this evening.

39
00:02:05,415 --> 00:02:10,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Superintendent Galussi, members of the school committee.

40
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:20,364
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for allowing members of the Andrews Middle School community to speak with you regarding our shared focus for the school year, creating a sense of belonging for students.

41
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:28,790
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the most important responsibilities we have as a school community is ensuring that every child feels a true sense of belonging.

42
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Belonging is not created by chance.

43
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:36,938
[SPEAKER_10]: It's built intentionally through opportunities we provide for students through voice and choice.

44
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:48,471
[SPEAKER_10]: When students are empowered to share their ideas, reflect on their learning, and influence the school experience, they begin to see themselves as valued members of our community.

45
00:02:49,556 --> 00:02:56,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Our goal is to create classrooms here at Andrews where students are simply not compliant participants, but active partners.

46
00:02:57,118 --> 00:03:04,461
[SPEAKER_10]: When students feel heard, have room to express themselves, and trust in their unique contributions to shape our school, they thrive.

47
00:03:05,181 --> 00:03:07,942
[SPEAKER_10]: And when they thrive, our community grows stronger.

48
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:17,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Earlier in mid-October, I had a student approach me who has been a member of the Andrews Middle School for three years.

49
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,673
[SPEAKER_10]: And she asked when we would be having our first spirit week.

50
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:28,079
[SPEAKER_10]: And I shared with her that I would be happy to support any activities, but I would want it to come from the students.

51
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:31,101
[SPEAKER_10]: And I encouraged her to create a vision for the week.

52
00:03:32,042 --> 00:03:37,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Our students this evening will share how they participated in the week's events and what that meant to them.

53
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:47,020
[SPEAKER_10]: Our first student was not feeling well today, so she is actually on, I believe, on the Zoom.

54
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Gianna?

55
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:50,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

56
00:03:52,864 --> 00:03:57,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Gianna, can you turn on your camera and audio for us?

57
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:12,147
[SPEAKER_10]: If she's not here, I do have her statement, which I can read for her.

58
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:14,027
[SPEAKER_00]: She is here.

59
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:15,148
[SPEAKER_06]: She is here.

60
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:17,889
[SPEAKER_06]: I did ask her to unmute.

61
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:31,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if she's having... I just lost track of her.

62
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:32,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Did she log on?

63
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:35,976
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought I saw someone come on.

64
00:04:37,395 --> 00:04:37,595
[SPEAKER_10]: here.

65
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:39,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there we go.

66
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:41,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

67
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,641
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Gianna.

68
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,202
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?

69
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:43,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.

70
00:04:43,922 --> 00:04:44,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

71
00:04:44,263 --> 00:04:45,404
[SPEAKER_10]: We're having problems.

72
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:46,325
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

73
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:46,806
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

74
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:49,789
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not feeling well today to go ahead.

75
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:50,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Take it away.

76
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:54,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi my name is Gianna Riccio.

77
00:04:54,174 --> 00:04:55,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I am in eighth grade.

78
00:04:55,455 --> 00:05:00,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a member at the Andrews Middle School since the sixth grade.

79
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:12,549
[SPEAKER_02]: The Andrews Middle School spirit week meant to me for all my peers to come together and make memories with their with their friends and new people.

80
00:05:15,211 --> 00:05:20,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought it up to Miss Skane asking if there was going to be a spirit week that Halloween.

81
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:20,496
[SPEAKER_02]: I think

82
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:30,801
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good idea for spirit week to happen for people to express themselves and create memories for the yearbook.

83
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:40,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought of the idea about how people can support a Mustang Pride while having fun.

84
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:44,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted the students at AMS to enjoy and create memories.

85
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:52,208
[SPEAKER_02]: And seeing all the pictures and the ideas that people came up with, it made me happy.

86
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:58,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people who helped me make the ideas, the CCSR club,

87
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:04,817
[SPEAKER_02]: to see everybody happy and I'll make all the memories that we made.

88
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:06,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

89
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:09,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Gianna.

90
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:10,881
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope you feel better.

91
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:15,384
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have the rest of the students here at the school with us.

92
00:06:15,424 --> 00:06:17,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to invite them to come on over now.

93
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,050
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, my name is Nora Shaw.

94
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:26,713
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm in sixth grade at the Andrews Middle School.

95
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,956
[SPEAKER_20]: I love being part of a group costume.

96
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:35,621
[SPEAKER_20]: The whole team building experience was very empowering and it made me feel confident.

97
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:42,127
[SPEAKER_20]: My friend group was all working together and collaborating and having fun together.

98
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:59,677
[SPEAKER_20]: We all contributed to it somehow like how my friend Catherine came up with the whole concept of having being crayons and then like all of us working together on what we should do and like some of us brought supplies for the accessories and some of us just like

99
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:01,598
[SPEAKER_20]: helped think of the ideas.

100
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:05,381
[SPEAKER_20]: All of it made me really feel like I was part of the Andrews community.

101
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:14,808
[SPEAKER_20]: The teachers all got in on it too by wearing six, seven, somewhere on the outfits, which is kind of ironic considering the fact that they all hate it whenever we do it.

102
00:07:15,948 --> 00:07:17,570
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for your time and have a great night.

103
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:28,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Raina Myers, and I'm in sixth grade at the Andrews Middle School, and I was also a crayon for group costume day.

104
00:07:28,653 --> 00:07:33,797
[SPEAKER_04]: We had so much fun with this costume, and one way it made me feel like I belonged is when we were in school the day of.

105
00:07:34,177 --> 00:07:37,179
[SPEAKER_04]: We got our costumes on, and we got a lot of compliments on our hard work.

106
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:42,983
[SPEAKER_04]: We had dressed in our color, and our friend Catherine sent us all a video and templates for our Crayola labels.

107
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:44,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you slow down?

108
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

109
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:48,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I read anything again?

110
00:07:50,472 --> 00:07:52,033
[SPEAKER_06]: You're doing a great job, keep going.

111
00:07:53,574 --> 00:08:00,519
[SPEAKER_04]: We traveled as a pack and made a rule that every crayon should be with another in the house, and address each other only as their color and crayon.

112
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,985
[SPEAKER_04]: It really made me feel special, very loved, and part of the Andrews community doing an expressive group costume with my friends.

113
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:14,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing I found amusing on when all of the students and all of the teachers in the school dressed up as 6-7.

114
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:19,776
[SPEAKER_04]: My social studies teacher Mr. Delaney hates 6-7 with a passion so to see him joining in was a shock.

115
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:24,360
[SPEAKER_04]: He even made a 6-7 joke in class and said if you can't beat him join him.

116
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,544
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a really fun concept and definitely added to the part of feeling connected and part of the community.

117
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:31,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you and have a good night.

118
00:08:33,328 --> 00:08:34,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Madison's next.

119
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:34,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Go for it.

120
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:37,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, my name is Madison Converse.

121
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:38,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in 8th grade.

122
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:41,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Andrews Municipal has many fun spirit weeks.

123
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:46,180
[SPEAKER_03]: For spirit week, one of the themes was matching costumes or matching costumes with a group.

124
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:51,023
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends and I decided to match and wear matching M&M shirts.

125
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:56,966
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Amelia came up with the idea and we all coordinated by discussing what color M&M shirts we all wanted.

126
00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:00,547
[SPEAKER_03]: We found a high ground where we all agreed and we were given our shirts.

127
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:05,209
[SPEAKER_03]: So on Halloween day we all matched and were being all matching M&Ms.

128
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,250
[SPEAKER_03]: The teachers were also included.

129
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,032
[SPEAKER_03]: On AA, the teachers dressed up as versions of my civics teacher.

130
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:17,215
[SPEAKER_03]: The spirit week helps add a sense of belonging because everybody has a way to be including and everybody's a chance to dress up.

131
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:18,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your time.

132
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:22,637
[SPEAKER_10]: And last but definitely not least is Amelia.

133
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:26,033
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, my name is Amelia Lengel.

134
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:29,276
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in 8th grade and I'm here to talk about my experience with Spirit Week.

135
00:09:29,697 --> 00:09:32,579
[SPEAKER_19]: Personally, I think Spirit Week is something everyone at AMS enjoys.

136
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,842
[SPEAKER_19]: It is a fun way to celebrate before a holiday.

137
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:37,985
[SPEAKER_19]: We had a Spirit Week the week of Halloween and it was a blast.

138
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:39,427
[SPEAKER_19]: Each day was a different theme.

139
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,588
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not just the students who get involved, it's also the teachers.

140
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:48,812
[SPEAKER_19]: On that Wednesday, we had a theme that is something we do quite often throughout the school year, Student Teacher Swap Day.

141
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:53,554
[SPEAKER_19]: The teachers dress like the students and the students dress like the teachers.

142
00:09:53,974 --> 00:09:58,577
[SPEAKER_19]: It is always a fun day, but everyone's favorite was Friday when you got to wear your costumes.

143
00:09:58,937 --> 00:10:04,960
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, my friends and I weren't all going trick-or-treating together, sadly, but for school we really wanted to do a group costume.

144
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,903
[SPEAKER_19]: So, me and my friend Madison, who just spoke, and I came up with the idea of M&Ms.

145
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:16,806
[SPEAKER_19]: My mom and I went to the store and got a bunch of different colored t-shirts and used our Cricut machine to put an M on all of them.

146
00:10:17,526 --> 00:10:19,647
[SPEAKER_19]: I gave them out to all my friends the next day to wear.

147
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:25,711
[SPEAKER_19]: Personally, I think Spirit Week is a great way to make the school week a little bit more fun before a holiday.

148
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,793
[SPEAKER_19]: The whole school comes together and really makes me feel like a part of the community.

149
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:33,535
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope everyone has a chance to feel like that throughout their time at AMS.

150
00:10:33,815 --> 00:10:35,817
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for your time and have an amazing rest of your night.

151
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:39,779
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

152
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:41,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you guys all want to come over?

153
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Does anyone have any questions for the kiddos?

154
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,024
[SPEAKER_08]: Great job to you all.

155
00:10:49,104 --> 00:10:51,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I'm going to turn it over to member and Tapa.

156
00:10:52,726 --> 00:10:53,346
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, mayor.

157
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, thank you all for talking about this tonight.

158
00:10:56,048 --> 00:11:03,271
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amazing how one question and one sort of goal can create just sense, um, this great sense of community and great sense of belonging.

159
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:08,574
[SPEAKER_13]: So I really applaud you all for playing your part in that, getting your faculty and staff involved in the whole thing.

160
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:10,155
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really cool to see this all come together.

161
00:11:11,022 --> 00:11:13,903
[SPEAKER_13]: And definitely keep at it, you know, make this a new tradition at AMS.

162
00:11:13,943 --> 00:11:19,804
[SPEAKER_13]: I know when I was at AMS, we had something similar, but not as something as big as this.

163
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:26,705
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just really cool to see how you guys took this under your belt as sixth graders, seventh graders, eighth graders to just do all of this.

164
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:28,465
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a future in that.

165
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:34,966
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a, if you, if this is something you love if you decide to go to college, you can do that as a part of one of your college jobs.

166
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:36,427
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a great, that's what I work in.

167
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:37,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I work as in campus activities.

168
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:42,789
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have eight student employees who do this every week and try to do something cool like that.

169
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,329
[SPEAKER_13]: So stick with it.

170
00:11:44,929 --> 00:11:45,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Do really cool things.

171
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:48,810
[SPEAKER_13]: When you go off to high school, keep doing it there.

172
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Work with the CCSR.

173
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Try to get some money to make it even bigger and better.

174
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:58,371
[SPEAKER_13]: And just thank you for trying to create a sense of community and working to create a sense of community amongst your peers.

175
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:02,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

176
00:12:05,053 --> 00:12:05,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep up the good work.

177
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:06,993
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

178
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:10,703
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna- Thank you so much.

179
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:13,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just like thank them before they go?

180
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:22,027
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is, we had to shift to being virtual and it was really nice to see how flexible you all were.

181
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:22,967
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

182
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:28,789
[SPEAKER_06]: We're so glad you were able to join for this Mustang moment and keep up the good work.

183
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:29,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

184
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:30,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

185
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

186
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor?

187
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:35,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Member Ruseau.

188
00:12:36,097 --> 00:12:38,559
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to make a motion to take item number six out of order.

189
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:40,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

190
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to take item six out of order by member Rousseau.

191
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:44,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second?

192
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:49,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

193
00:12:51,467 --> 00:12:53,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Olapade, roll call please.

194
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:54,810
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Branley?

195
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:57,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

196
00:12:58,272 --> 00:12:58,972
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham?

197
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:00,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

198
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:01,554
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Intoppa?

199
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:02,395
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

200
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:03,916
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Olapade?

201
00:13:04,236 --> 00:13:04,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

202
00:13:05,177 --> 00:13:05,817
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Reinfeld?

203
00:13:07,489 --> 00:13:07,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

204
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:10,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Members say yes, Mayor Langenkirchen.

205
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

206
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:19,132
[SPEAKER_08]: I see number six as reports requested or so.

207
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:26,654
[SPEAKER_17]: I see this presentations at the student advisory council, but I don't know if I'm looking at it.

208
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:28,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're right.

209
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:29,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry about that.

210
00:13:29,655 --> 00:13:32,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, I see it now.

211
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:34,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Presentations of the student advisory council,

212
00:13:36,043 --> 00:13:37,324
[SPEAKER_08]: on high school transportation.

213
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:44,851
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have Jayden on the call and he's going to be leading the presentation this evening.

214
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:46,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Will will screen share in just a minute.

215
00:13:47,974 --> 00:14:02,526
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also did notice that the, that assistant principal Sheila Freitas is on the call who also works with the student advisory council and just wanted to make sure that people were aware of that.

216
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:07,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're all set for the screen share.

217
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:08,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

218
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Jayden, are you all set?

219
00:14:17,641 --> 00:14:18,441
[SPEAKER_15]: Is my mic working?

220
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:19,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we can hear you.

221
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:20,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

222
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:21,102
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

223
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:22,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

224
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:32,807
[SPEAKER_15]: So we at the Student Advisory Committee, we've gotten feedback on a newly implemented railing system

225
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,871
[SPEAKER_15]: we have at the high school.

226
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:45,955
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've gotten some, a bit of negative feedback about how the single railing system just isn't working out.

227
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:50,357
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've come up with a few suggestions on how we could fix that.

228
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:58,681
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them is, oh, and also like the bus system in general.

229
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:01,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we go back to the last slide real quick?

230
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:03,083
[SPEAKER_15]: One of them was,

231
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:13,331
[SPEAKER_15]: if we could discuss with the MBTA about having more buses for after school and stuff, as well as creating a few more railings.

232
00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:24,114
[SPEAKER_15]: That way, there'll be less trying to funnel in as many students into, I'm trying to remember the term for it, bottlenecking.

233
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:29,216
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can move on to the next slide.

234
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:35,433
[SPEAKER_15]: So these are two pictures of what we currently have right now.

235
00:15:36,653 --> 00:15:39,174
[SPEAKER_15]: We have two bus stops set up here.

236
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:43,515
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe you can see the railings on the left side.

237
00:15:43,535 --> 00:15:46,616
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can see another one on the right side.

238
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:52,157
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if we could go to the next slide.

239
00:15:53,959 --> 00:16:00,765
[SPEAKER_15]: And what we want is we want to implement two more railings along these two areas over here.

240
00:16:01,265 --> 00:16:13,415
[SPEAKER_15]: That way, more students will be able to access the buses at the same time instead of the buses needing to wait for others to finish loading their students before they can take a spot.

241
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:19,781
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we'll go to the next slide.

242
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:29,893
[SPEAKER_15]: more images of spots.

243
00:16:29,913 --> 00:16:48,301
[SPEAKER_15]: So we want to talk to, I believe, the director of transportation about how we can implement these changes, especially with the MBTA, since we have to find a way for them to comply with these changes.

244
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:58,498
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'd also like to send out a survey to students about their feedback on our current system and how they would feel about changing it up.

245
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:09,044
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is an easy change, but we can talk to MetalFab about how, if they want to make us two more railings for this.

246
00:17:15,287 --> 00:17:16,248
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any questions?

247
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:27,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Member, is it?

248
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:29,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Jayden, was that the last slide?

249
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:32,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, was that the last slide, Jayden?

250
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

251
00:17:34,081 --> 00:17:35,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, just making sure.

252
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:36,402
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted you to present first.

253
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:40,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll pass it over to a member in the top.

254
00:17:42,746 --> 00:17:43,226
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor.

255
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:46,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Jayden, for presenting on this information and for talking about it.

256
00:17:46,508 --> 00:17:54,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna second your thought process on interviewing and talking to the students at the high school, especially those who take the bus.

257
00:17:55,492 --> 00:18:09,056
[SPEAKER_13]: When you try to implement something new into someone's routine, it can have a bit of a pushback at the beginning, but it's all about trying to find a way to ease someone into a new system or to figure out what are the roadblocks.

258
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:14,778
[SPEAKER_13]: And sometimes they're obvious things where it's like, oh, I don't like the railings of this.

259
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:15,558
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't like it because of that.

260
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:18,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Or sometimes it's things that you would have never thought of.

261
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,080
[SPEAKER_13]: And so sending out a survey before you make any other changes and even putting in

262
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:25,216
[SPEAKER_13]: would a second railing work?

263
00:18:25,256 --> 00:18:42,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Giving people options so they don't have to think too much, but to give some things that you're already thinking about and pitch some stuff is what I completely recommend as you try to solve the overcrowding issue of getting onto the bus and making sure that everyone boards safely and effectively and as quickly as possible.

264
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:47,475
[SPEAKER_13]: But definitely leave a section there for, you know,

265
00:18:47,895 --> 00:18:49,376
[SPEAKER_13]: What are some other alternative methods?

266
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:50,097
[SPEAKER_13]: You'd be surprised.

267
00:18:50,117 --> 00:18:53,579
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people just may have some other ideas that they've noticed in using it.

268
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Then, yeah, talk to your users.

269
00:18:56,561 --> 00:19:02,685
[SPEAKER_13]: And I agree with your next steps that you're thinking of.

270
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:05,027
[SPEAKER_13]: So definitely create that survey if you want.

271
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:06,868
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I won't.

272
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:09,790
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a background in product design and industrial design.

273
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,391
[SPEAKER_13]: We do stuff like this all the time in designing experiences.

274
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:16,074
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you guys want to throw it my way, I'll volunteer myself to take a look at something

275
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,249
[SPEAKER_13]: as well as I'm sure your building staff, Ms.

276
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:21,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Farias as well, so go for it.

277
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we actually have the survey made already, I think.

278
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,210
[SPEAKER_15]: We just haven't sent it out yet.

279
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Way ahead of the game, great.

280
00:19:35,912 --> 00:19:37,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Reinfeld, I believe was next, then Member Branley.

281
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:39,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, thank you.

282
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:42,573
[SPEAKER_09]: So I remember the student council meeting when you all were discussing

283
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:58,710
[SPEAKER_09]: the problem and I love that you've got a solution and I've talked to a couple of your users and they've agreed that the, I definitely support getting a few more railings because I know you solved the mass flood onto the buses, but the waiting has introduced a new problem.

284
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:10,076
[SPEAKER_09]: So my only recommendation is that you also talk to Kyle, your security monitor who kind of oversees that bus process and get that input already as well if you haven't already.

285
00:20:10,696 --> 00:20:15,107
[SPEAKER_09]: because I know he sees things from a particular perspective and that big picture.

286
00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:17,353
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks for taking action to change.

287
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:31,982
[SPEAKER_09]: to fix the problem and I look forward to hearing how this goes particularly around your conversation with Mr. Schwartz and what can be done in collaboration with the city and the MBTA.

288
00:20:32,002 --> 00:20:44,948
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a big question and I don't know if the mayor has things to say about that in terms of the relationship with the city and the schools and the MBTA, but thank you so much for including all these voices in this problem solving.

289
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

290
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Branley and then member.

291
00:20:51,361 --> 00:20:51,801
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

292
00:20:52,441 --> 00:20:54,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so I just have a question about the signage.

293
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:58,503
[SPEAKER_07]: It says contact MBTA signage for arrivals and departures in real time.

294
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:00,964
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your vision for that?

295
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:02,944
[SPEAKER_15]: So.

296
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:05,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, one of my.

297
00:21:07,285 --> 00:21:09,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Other one of the other members in student

298
00:21:16,968 --> 00:21:19,709
[SPEAKER_15]: Like the departures and arrivals in real time.

299
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:22,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Like at the train station when you wake up?

300
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:22,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

301
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, just curious what you meant by that.

302
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,071
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to try and find a way to see if we can program that.

303
00:21:29,851 --> 00:21:38,733
[SPEAKER_15]: And signage might also refer to just having signs out in front labeling which bus goes where.

304
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:41,638
[SPEAKER_07]: is there a set spot for those?

305
00:21:41,678 --> 00:21:45,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say, and I'm gonna be really honest, because I tend to be really honest on these meetings.

306
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:49,764
[SPEAKER_07]: When I first pulled up to that, I said, who the heck thought of this?

307
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:53,847
[SPEAKER_07]: Because as a mom who's dropping off, I'm like, do I pull up against it?

308
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:54,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I pull before it?

309
00:21:55,268 --> 00:21:56,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I pull beside it?

310
00:21:56,488 --> 00:21:58,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I drive past this?

311
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,313
[SPEAKER_07]: And I sort of felt like it blocked people from getting out of their cars to a degree.

312
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:08,377
[SPEAKER_07]: But I guess in the big picture of everybody coming out at the same time,

313
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:12,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I can see why we would need to kind of funnel students.

314
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:19,478
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just want us to be mindful of the fact that in the morning when people are pulling up to

315
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,313
[SPEAKER_07]: that there is this, you know, well, I mean, I guess this is beyond this.

316
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,194
[SPEAKER_07]: There should be some etiquette when people are pulling up.

317
00:22:27,214 --> 00:22:30,876
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there are people that are waiting in their cars for their kids to get out or kids that might need extra time.

318
00:22:31,356 --> 00:22:34,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Buses are pulling up, buses are pulling, you know, away.

319
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:38,000
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think to a degree, it kind of bottlenecks people a little.

320
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,342
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want us to be mindful of that if we're going to put more up.

321
00:22:42,102 --> 00:22:49,968
[SPEAKER_07]: that we're giving maybe a little bit of space for cars to pull up and open their doors and just so that there's still that passing lane to our left.

322
00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:52,030
[SPEAKER_07]: So just some things to think about.

323
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,552
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the idea of the signage.

324
00:22:55,632 --> 00:23:01,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I just am wondering if it would be really accurate and if it would be worth it.

325
00:23:01,417 --> 00:23:02,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love if it was accurate.

326
00:23:03,118 --> 00:23:08,222
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I just know I've stood at the train before and I'm like, that's the longest 12 minutes I ever spent waiting here, 45.

327
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,384
[SPEAKER_07]: So just things to think about, but I love your idea.

328
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:13,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

329
00:23:16,469 --> 00:23:18,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham, then back to Member Intoppa.

330
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:21,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

331
00:23:22,462 --> 00:23:32,130
[SPEAKER_11]: As it relates to the idea of a late bus for the high school, that's actually not something we've heard people talk about before.

332
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,971
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for bringing that forward.

333
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:36,233
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes a lot of sense.

334
00:23:36,953 --> 00:23:44,279
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of surprised we've never heard anybody articulate that before, because there is so much activity that happens after school at the high school.

335
00:23:46,642 --> 00:24:08,397
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think my request is that once our transportation coordinator gets their feet under them, and we are starting to talk about next year's budget, can we do a little bit of a dive into what additional coverage options might be, not just at the high school, but district-wide?

336
00:24:09,258 --> 00:24:14,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we have long been talking about increased transportation, and we've not been able to

337
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:24,266
[SPEAKER_11]: We've not been able to really expand in very many places in the way that I would like to see us be able to do it.

338
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:29,447
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it would be helpful to have that conversation as part of the budget.

339
00:24:29,647 --> 00:24:46,730
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think with our transportation coordinator on board, there might be an opportunity to have a little bit more of a cohesive look at transportation so that we can just be thoughtful about what we can do and can fund in this upcoming budget versus what do we have to plan for down the road.

340
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:49,452
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for bringing that forward.

341
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:50,633
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes perfect sense.

342
00:24:50,753 --> 00:24:52,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just like absolutely surprised.

343
00:24:52,914 --> 00:24:53,694
[SPEAKER_11]: We've never heard it before.

344
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:56,595
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, thank you for being at the meeting.

345
00:25:00,116 --> 00:25:02,477
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, ma'am grant member and top of and Dr. Pelosi.

346
00:25:02,497 --> 00:25:04,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

347
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:05,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

348
00:25:07,858 --> 00:25:08,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

349
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:09,579
[SPEAKER_13]: How, how is the weather out there right now?

350
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,440
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks freezing and I don't want to go walk outside in Boston either.

351
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,000
[SPEAKER_13]: It's too windy.

352
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,112
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry if you saw the look on my face where I was confused.

353
00:25:16,212 --> 00:25:18,273
[SPEAKER_13]: It's because I was like, wait, we had a late bus.

354
00:25:18,313 --> 00:25:19,154
[SPEAKER_13]: And then, no, it wasn't.

355
00:25:19,174 --> 00:25:24,957
[SPEAKER_13]: It was that the North Medford bus was so late that it felt like a late bus to get to the North Medford Heights, leaving high school every day.

356
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:27,099
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's where my kind of like, what?

357
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:28,280
[SPEAKER_13]: We've never had this before?

358
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,980
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we haven't.

359
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,362
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just that that bus used to get here so late.

360
00:25:31,382 --> 00:25:35,744
[SPEAKER_13]: And people would either take the T down at the bottom of the hill and not at the top of the high school in order to take.

361
00:25:36,485 --> 00:25:39,867
[SPEAKER_13]: The late bus was just walking down the hill and taking the bus there.

362
00:25:39,887 --> 00:25:42,569
[SPEAKER_13]: It didn't actually go up to the sequence.

363
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:49,544
[SPEAKER_13]: Jayden, a few things that I noted when we were talking about the displays, and I'm sorry that I missed the part of display art, so I said that earlier.

364
00:25:51,165 --> 00:25:52,226
[SPEAKER_13]: The T-screens are great.

365
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:57,990
[SPEAKER_13]: Look into, and you remember in robotics may have done that, look into E-ink and look into using that.

366
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,731
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what they use at the green line stops.

367
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:06,096
[SPEAKER_13]: That's because one, it only uses energy to change, and two, it's so much easier to read, especially if it's sunny out.

368
00:26:06,156 --> 00:26:09,178
[SPEAKER_13]: You won't have to create a canopy and design a way that that

369
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:11,754
[SPEAKER_13]: screen won't break.

370
00:26:12,494 --> 00:26:13,535
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's something to note.

371
00:26:14,415 --> 00:26:28,139
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in term of member Bramley's point about confusing, you know, folks may be getting confused when they go and see these is a simple change, maybe just adding like a bus stop here sign.

372
00:26:28,199 --> 00:26:35,141
[SPEAKER_13]: So that way it signals to people that they're meant for the buses and not meant for, you know, personal vehicles.

373
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:38,922
[SPEAKER_13]: And so adding a bus stop here, like they do, if you've been on the green line in Boston,

374
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:44,477
[SPEAKER_13]: that may be something small that might signal to people, you know, that.

375
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:51,425
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you're curious about what that e-ink signage looks like, if you go around Medford, there's those kiosks.

376
00:26:51,485 --> 00:27:01,996
[SPEAKER_13]: There's one in Haines Square right on the corner by the hardware store, as well as one on the corner in the hillside across from the old hardware store, old hillside hardware.

377
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:11,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are some cool things to look at in terms of what that technology looks like, and you can use it as a, you can order that stuff online and use it for display.

378
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,792
[SPEAKER_13]: People use it for weather stuff all the time.

379
00:27:13,812 --> 00:27:18,635
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry if I'm saying something that you already know, but these are just things that I noted while we were talking.

380
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:23,359
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for looking into this as complex as you are, and I really appreciate it.

381
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:39,574
[SPEAKER_06]: So before I speak, I don't know, Jaden, do you want to have an opportunity to answer any of the questions or points that was brought to you before I speak?

382
00:27:42,215 --> 00:27:44,456
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I think I'm good.

383
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:50,178
[SPEAKER_15]: As everyone was speaking, I was writing down their suggestions for the other members of the student advisory committee.

384
00:27:51,310 --> 00:28:02,242
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, because I just I wanted to point out when I joined the student advisory committee meeting last week and was speaking with the students, there was a discussion on to member Branley's point.

385
00:28:03,055 --> 00:28:19,761
[SPEAKER_06]: where the railings were to be placed because we also have, that did come up about just car drop-offs as well as at the beginning of that drive, we have both the Kids' Corner drop-off door and the Medford Family Network drop-off door.

386
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:30,965
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the students were really very thoughtful about where they would want to place the other two railings to make sure that we're leaving that front area as like a

387
00:28:31,825 --> 00:28:44,753
[SPEAKER_06]: open for car drop off but I think so that in addition to being very thoughtful about where those hopeful to new railings come from once metal fabs able to create them.

388
00:28:45,732 --> 00:28:58,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they were having a discussion about labeling them so that it's very clear which bus is lining up with which railing, which will also help with the car drop off.

389
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:06,717
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a conversation too around internal use of TV screens that display student news.

390
00:29:07,577 --> 00:29:14,103
[SPEAKER_06]: and announcements throughout the day, and using that as a way to keep students current.

391
00:29:14,163 --> 00:29:22,711
[SPEAKER_06]: So the railings have really helped embarking on the bus, but what's happening now, to remember Reinfeld brought up, is waiting.

392
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:29,437
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes as the students are waiting for the buses to arrive and get on, that's creating

393
00:29:31,632 --> 00:29:44,890
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even a bottleneck yet, but if there was an opportunity to have some students be able to wait inside or somewhere else and keeping current updated information on the monitors throughout the school would be helpful.

394
00:29:46,287 --> 00:29:50,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other piece that I was going to mention is the part about the late bus.

395
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:57,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think some of the things that we're working through is also that change in our dismissal time.

396
00:29:57,773 --> 00:30:08,698
[SPEAKER_06]: So because our dismissal time is 15 minutes later than it was before, the North Medford bus is also the bus that returns immediately to the high school for athletics.

397
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:19,898
[SPEAKER_06]: And so trying to figure out, Evan is going to be working with the school and the students to figure out what

398
00:30:21,128 --> 00:30:23,489
[SPEAKER_06]: would be, what would students need?

399
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:33,535
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be, to member Graham's point, we do have to be mindful of this for our budget build for next year, but what would be the need in terms of when students are staying late?

400
00:30:34,536 --> 00:30:37,677
[SPEAKER_06]: At the middle school, you know, there are three days that there are late buses.

401
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:48,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And so trying to figure out what that need would be for the North Medford, which is the only yellow bus we have at the high school as the MBTA,

402
00:30:49,567 --> 00:31:15,696
[SPEAKER_06]: does continuously run it does not run as frequently when it's after school and that piece Evan and the students will be working hopefully in partnership with the city with the MBTA but in terms of that one yellow bus that we have for North Medford we're trying to figure out what would the actual need be how many days would we need it and so there are some ongoing conversations with

403
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:19,661
[SPEAKER_06]: the school and the students to narrow that down.

404
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:24,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

405
00:31:24,364 --> 00:31:26,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Lucey, and thank you, Jayden, for presenting.

406
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,287
[SPEAKER_08]: We look forward to the survey results, so please keep us posted on that as well.

407
00:31:32,128 --> 00:31:32,689
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Jayden.

408
00:31:32,729 --> 00:31:33,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent job.

409
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a motion to revert back?

410
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to talk, Ms.

411
00:31:39,573 --> 00:31:40,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Freitas?

412
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:41,594
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

413
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:42,895
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on mute, so please.

414
00:31:47,222 --> 00:31:48,282
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, thank you so much.

415
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:50,343
[SPEAKER_18]: Great job, Jaden.

416
00:31:50,723 --> 00:32:01,126
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to talk a little bit about the late bus and just kind of the talk amongst the kids around belonging and equity, right?

417
00:32:01,366 --> 00:32:09,448
[SPEAKER_18]: So there are some kids that can't do student advisory council because they have to go home right after school because there is no late bus.

418
00:32:09,988 --> 00:32:13,070
[SPEAKER_18]: So the kids brought that to my attention.

419
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,251
[SPEAKER_18]: I said, let's look into it.

420
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:18,113
[SPEAKER_18]: We're focusing on belonging and equity.

421
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:20,514
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what our goal is.

422
00:32:20,974 --> 00:32:26,717
[SPEAKER_18]: So that was a consistent thing that has occurred over the last three years.

423
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,620
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm very proud of them for kind of pushing that work forward.

424
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:40,462
[SPEAKER_18]: Secondly, it has been wonderful to be a part of conversations with Matt Rice and SMMA about a new school.

425
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:59,827
[SPEAKER_18]: Wouldn't it be amazing to have departure and arrival times and also, like the MBTA, have hearing impaired and people that can't see, the ability to put that something up to help people navigate the buses in a new building.

426
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:00,947
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that's not

427
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:11,973
[SPEAKER_18]: anytime soon but you know if we're thinking about the future you know I would love for us to be able to provide access to kids.

428
00:33:12,134 --> 00:33:29,004
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a lot of ninth graders that come up and don't understand where the bus stops and so on and so forth and you know I think it's important to provide them with as much information as possible so they're not scared about getting on the bus and riding the bus to Medford High School.

429
00:33:29,884 --> 00:33:41,951
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, you know, again, this is a work in progress, but, uh, it's been pretty exciting to sit in and listen to Matt and, uh, all the people at Medford High talk about a future in Medford.

430
00:33:42,031 --> 00:33:43,051
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm pumped.

431
00:33:43,211 --> 00:33:50,675
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the second time I've worked with SMMA and, uh, let's make it better than Waltham and better than Somerville.

432
00:33:51,015 --> 00:33:51,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

433
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,677
[SPEAKER_18]: And also where our spirit week just started.

434
00:33:57,639 --> 00:33:58,640
[SPEAKER_18]: The Mustang.

435
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

436
00:33:59,786 --> 00:34:00,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

437
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:00,866
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

00:34:00,986 --> 00:34:01,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:01,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

00:34:01,746 --> 00:34:07,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, motion to revert to the regular order of business.

441
00:34:08,868 --> 00:34:09,568
[SPEAKER_12]: A motion for that.

442
00:34:09,588 --> 00:34:13,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember all parties seconded by a second.

443

[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

453
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:38,489
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

454
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:42,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to revert back to the regular order business has been approved.

455
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:49,835
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Chad Fallon, executive director of CTE, to give us an update on the CTE grants.

456
00:34:52,276 --> 00:34:53,137
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, good evening, everyone.

457
00:34:55,213 --> 00:35:03,657
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna give an update tonight on some money that has entered into the district tonight and just share with you some of the initiatives that we're gonna be using the money for.

458
00:35:03,677 --> 00:35:10,301
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was, let me just move my screen here.

459
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,182
[SPEAKER_01]: Helpful to remember when you think about CareerTech and Medford, what we operate on.

460
00:35:16,222 --> 00:35:18,003
[SPEAKER_01]: So for FY26, our budget was $254,500.

461
00:35:18,143 --> 00:35:25,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Of that, we depend on the revenue that we generate in our programs and donations.

462
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:32,650
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that number added to the FY26 grant funding so far, we're going to be bringing in another $542,000 to our little school.

463
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,130
[SPEAKER_01]: The money that

464
00:35:38,393 --> 00:35:43,976
[SPEAKER_01]: It's targeted for, this is going to be for specific professional development for the CareerTech faculty.

465
00:35:44,616 --> 00:35:51,420
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be working on aligning our programs to academic offerings in partnership with the Lynch School for Boston College.

466
00:35:52,120 --> 00:36:01,005
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be funding, we got some funding to support the development of our new Chapter 74 programs for plumbing and information support services and networking.

467
00:36:02,098 --> 00:36:07,902
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be using money from our Perkins to upgrade equipment in culinary, film and TV, and cosmetology.

468
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:18,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, with Perkins, we use that money for OSHA training, specialized exams for students to strengthen their own portfolio, and funds to subsidize the cost of boots and uniforms for students.

469
00:36:23,925 --> 00:36:28,048
[SPEAKER_01]: The 422A was really a gift from the Department of Education.

470
00:36:28,148 --> 00:36:30,549
[SPEAKER_01]: This is because we're in the pipeline for new programs.

471
00:36:30,609 --> 00:36:32,991
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was an allocated amount of $35,000.

472
00:36:33,051 --> 00:36:40,295
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be super helpful in the work that we need to do over the next six months to get a program open in the fall.

473
00:36:40,315 --> 00:36:41,436
[SPEAKER_01]: 422A for $35,000.

474
00:36:48,228 --> 00:36:49,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I had applied for this grant.

475
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:49,869
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 426.

476
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:52,491
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for competency based implementation.

477
00:36:52,531 --> 00:37:00,156
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all of the frameworks for every chapter 74 program were rewritten and basically put public just this school year.

478
00:37:00,656 --> 00:37:10,463
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to take this money again for targeted professional development for teachers to work on scope and sequence planning and again to the work that it takes to align academic courses to our CTE programs.

479
00:37:15,672 --> 00:37:18,017
[SPEAKER_01]: This was Perkins, which I had mentioned this every year.

480
00:37:18,037 --> 00:37:20,461
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually do not do salaries out of Perkins.

481
00:37:20,501 --> 00:37:23,467
[SPEAKER_01]: We take the allocated amount and we use it for supplies and equipment.

482
00:37:23,527 --> 00:37:25,992
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the $64,000 for three different programs.

483
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:37,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last grant that was a year in delay, but we did finally receive it, was our latest round of skills capital.

484
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:51,454
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is $404,000 that we're putting directly into the auto tech program to educate students and train students on EV engines, electric cars, and hybrid motors.

485
00:37:52,275 --> 00:37:55,777
[SPEAKER_01]: This, just so you know, is the fourth time that we've received these funds.

486
00:37:55,857 --> 00:38:00,240
[SPEAKER_01]: In previous years, we had used it to build the bistro, upgrade our engineering shop,

487
00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:02,913
[SPEAKER_01]: $300,000 for our construction program.

488
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:05,839
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the fourth year of this award for us.

489
00:38:06,561 --> 00:38:10,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just want to brag that it's the second highest award in the state.

490
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:11,212
[SPEAKER_01]: So really happy for Medford.

491
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:20,094
[SPEAKER_01]: This last grant, I'm a little superstitious, so I don't want to say too much.

492
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:23,356
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one that we just applied for just last month.

493
00:38:24,156 --> 00:38:29,860
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get this one, this will be a big one, and this will help us really deploy the two new programs in the fall.

494
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:35,784
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a grant that was targeted specifically for schools looking to add programs to add seats for kids.

495
00:38:36,624 --> 00:38:39,046
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should be finding out somewhere at the end of December.

496
00:38:39,706 --> 00:38:40,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Fingers crossed on this one.

497
00:38:41,607 --> 00:38:42,768
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a quick update.

498
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:49,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.

499
00:38:51,628 --> 00:38:53,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Great job on those grants.

500
00:38:55,893 --> 00:38:59,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, if we can get the whole $60 million, I hope we can make some more space.

501
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:00,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that'd be great.

502
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:02,440
[SPEAKER_16]: Me too, Paul.

503
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:06,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

504
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:07,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham?

505
00:39:10,752 --> 00:39:11,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

506
00:39:11,272 --> 00:39:15,775
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say thank you for pulling it all together so we can understand.

507
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:20,817
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of this stuff comes in in dribbles, and we hear about them in one-off ways.

508
00:39:20,897 --> 00:39:26,200
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you see them sort of tallied up, it makes a big difference.

509
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,243
[SPEAKER_11]: And then my question was, we don't need to accept these because they're grants.

510
00:39:31,423 --> 00:39:32,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct?

511
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:35,145
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do we need to motion to approve these?

512
00:39:41,228 --> 00:39:41,528
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

513
00:39:41,748 --> 00:39:43,350
[SPEAKER_06]: You This is for information.

514
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,991
[SPEAKER_06]: You do not need to approve them.

515
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:48,834
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just so that you are aware of what has been awarded and how it's being used.

516
00:39:51,075 --> 00:39:51,256
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

517
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,576
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

518
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:56,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Branley.

519
00:39:58,101 --> 00:39:58,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to thank Mr

520
00:40:06,557 --> 00:40:15,787
[SPEAKER_07]: managing all of these businesses, and staff, and students, and all the pots that you have your hand in actually amazes me.

521
00:40:16,808 --> 00:40:21,753
[SPEAKER_07]: As I depart my seat here at the school committee, I hope that this committee truly remembers what a crown jewel

522
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:27,458
[SPEAKER_07]: This Vogue is, I've become part of the Vogue family.

523
00:40:27,678 --> 00:40:29,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm staying there, that's for sure.

524
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,424
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not leaving the Vogue family no matter what, but I'm really, really proud of you guys.

525
00:40:35,484 --> 00:40:36,885
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for everything that you do.

526
00:40:36,905 --> 00:40:40,228
[SPEAKER_07]: I will continue to plug the Vogue here, there, and everywhere.

527
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:46,253
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if you haven't ordered your pies yet for Thanksgiving, I think it would be a great idea.

528
00:40:46,293 --> 00:40:47,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my little flyer here.

529
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:52,398
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I'm blurry, but you can order pies at the Bistro through Friday.

530
00:40:52,718 --> 00:40:58,483
[SPEAKER_07]: So just send a little email right to Chef P. It says Bistro right on there, and he'll get your pies ready for you.

531
00:40:58,503 --> 00:40:58,543
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

532
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:03,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Brinley.

533
00:41:04,908 --> 00:41:05,429
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Fallon.

534
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:06,850
[SPEAKER_08]: We appreciate your presentation.

535
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:07,510
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody.

536
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:07,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good night.

537
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:09,392
[SPEAKER_08]: You too.

538
00:41:10,191 --> 00:41:13,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Next up we have HMFAH school use report.

539
00:41:13,735 --> 00:41:16,358
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll pass it over to you, Dr. Galussi.

540
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

541
00:41:18,381 --> 00:41:23,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to give it a second for Mr. Pippa Sallie to do the screen share for me.

542
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:24,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

543
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:27,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

544
00:41:27,873 --> 00:41:28,794
[SPEAKER_06]: So good evening.

545
00:41:28,814 --> 00:41:37,539
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to begin this presentation just a little bit on the next slide by grounding us in how we arrived at this discussion tonight.

546
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:52,627
[SPEAKER_06]: So last May, during the school committee subcommittee meeting on enrollment and overcrowding, there was a resolution that was brought forward that acknowledged the pressure that some of our elementary schools were facing around shifting enrollment,

547
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:59,470
[SPEAKER_06]: uneven capacity across the buildings, and a need for both immediate relief and long-term planning.

548
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:14,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see this, what is on this slide, was not only a clip from the presentation last year but also the short-term and the long-term suggestions, ideas, solutions that we discussed.

549
00:42:14,277 --> 00:42:14,577
[SPEAKER_06]: So

550
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:24,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Since this meeting, we have taken some meaningful steps to address short-term needs for this current school year.

551
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:26,543
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why there's a little green check mark.

552
00:42:26,583 --> 00:42:36,388
[SPEAKER_06]: We did wind up relocating the MEEP at the Roberts to the Missituk, which allowed for some additional space at the Roberts.

553
00:42:37,629 --> 00:42:40,695
[SPEAKER_06]: where the Roberts is experiencing some overcrowding.

554
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:45,884
[SPEAKER_06]: This kindergarten class was not as large as we have seen since COVID.

555
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:50,011
[SPEAKER_06]: We're keeping a close eye on that, but there needed to be a little bit of a relief.

556
00:42:51,189 --> 00:43:01,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there was also an additional special education teacher at the Roberts that was hired this year to ensure inclusive specialist coverage.

557
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:11,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we did launch a comprehensive space utilization study using HMFH to see how our K-8 buildings

558
00:43:13,225 --> 00:43:17,829
[SPEAKER_06]: how the space is being used currently and what opportunities, you know, exist.

559
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:27,157
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll also notice on this screen as part of last year's work, we did review, the district did review a lot of long-term solutions.

560
00:43:27,718 --> 00:43:36,766
[SPEAKER_06]: We, as you have listed here, where we looked at the possibility of a weighted lottery for kindergarten, grade span restructuring,

561
00:43:38,607 --> 00:43:41,690
[SPEAKER_06]: a review of where we're placing our special education programs.

562
00:43:42,671 --> 00:44:04,111
[SPEAKER_06]: We really did take a comprehensive look at what other opportunities could be, but decided really what is best for the district at the time is let's get a better understanding as to how our spaces are used so that we have some information when we are discussing next steps.

563
00:44:05,427 --> 00:44:10,391
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what we are here tonight to do, is discuss the Space Utilization Study.

564
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:22,439
[SPEAKER_06]: So right here on this slide, what you can see is this captures the work that HMFH did during the Space Utilization Study.

565
00:44:25,463 --> 00:44:34,670
[SPEAKER_06]: They visited all four elementary schools, as well as the McGlynn Middle School and the Andrews Middle School, and they looked at the current use of classrooms.

566
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:52,202
[SPEAKER_06]: They identified spaces within each school that could possibly be used as additional classrooms, but I think it's important to note that the criteria that they used were that these were the size of these classrooms, if these classrooms had windows, and how close they were to circulation paths.

567
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:56,146
[SPEAKER_06]: That will come up in future conversations, so I think it's important to note.

568
00:44:56,967 --> 00:45:10,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they did know, based on the framing from that subcommittee meeting, that the places of particular interest regarding capacity were the Brooks and the Roberts elementary schools.

569
00:45:14,567 --> 00:45:24,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So this right here, the chart below here just shows, this was HMFH findings for how classrooms were used last year.

570
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:33,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you can see that they have tallied core classrooms last year by grade level span.

571
00:45:35,151 --> 00:45:41,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important to note that subseparate specialized programs are not reflected in these numbers.

572
00:45:42,234 --> 00:45:53,819
[SPEAKER_06]: And where you see some of the, where some of them are located is in this orange box where it says possible additional classroom space.

573
00:45:54,519 --> 00:46:07,849
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is based on enrollment numbers, class sizes, and again, their criteria of the size of the classroom, if they had windows, and proximity to circulation paths.

574
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,451
[SPEAKER_06]: You also would notice the last

575
00:46:12,432 --> 00:46:14,933
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe just if I keep on that span for just a second.

576
00:46:14,973 --> 00:46:24,416
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the Brooks, that meant that there were six classrooms that they felt the district could take an additional look at and see, all right, how are these six being used?

577
00:46:24,856 --> 00:46:27,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we leverage these in a different way?

578
00:46:28,137 --> 00:46:29,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there something we can do?

579
00:46:30,097 --> 00:46:31,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And so forth down the list.

580
00:46:31,798 --> 00:46:39,340
[SPEAKER_06]: So Missituk, they wanted us to look at five, Roberts five, McGlynn Elementary Middle seven between the two of them and Andrews nine.

581
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:58,305
[SPEAKER_06]: The last two rows talk about how we are currently using, like how many students within that grade span across the district are an average in these classrooms and how many we can put in there per the CBA.

582
00:46:59,065 --> 00:47:05,187
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanna note that when they did this, there is some leverage here.

583
00:47:06,168 --> 00:47:08,929
[SPEAKER_06]: They used the old CBA and not the current CBA.

584
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:13,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Next slide, please.

585
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:32,074
[SPEAKER_06]: So taking the results that they gave us and knowing that they said that these classrooms warranted an additional review, and to build on that, we did conduct just an initial internal walkthrough.

586
00:47:33,014 --> 00:47:40,520
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did that specifically at the Andrews because so many classrooms were identified as, hey, there are nine classrooms here.

587
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:42,582
[SPEAKER_06]: that warrant a review.

588
00:47:43,082 --> 00:47:57,247
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also noticed that because of the criteria they came up with around windows and size and circulation paths, there were a lot of classrooms that they did not include in the original report.

589
00:47:57,868 --> 00:48:10,173
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was important for us to get a better understanding by walking the building about where are these nine classes and why weren't all of them part of the report.

590
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:20,002
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we came to find out is that there were several spaces that are currently being used differently than from what the original intention was.

591
00:48:20,562 --> 00:48:38,366
[SPEAKER_06]: When a space utilization study is done, they're using the original floor plans, and they're looking at, okay, when this building was built, this is how this room was supposed to be used, and then they're kind of looking at how it's currently being used, and that's how they're flagging these spaces.

592
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:42,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, there were several spaces that warrant a further review.

593
00:48:43,481 --> 00:49:00,933
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's also important to note that if we were going to maybe repurpose some of these areas, that there are varying levels of renovation or facility work that may need to happen in order to make them efficient to the purpose that we need it to be.

594
00:49:02,674 --> 00:49:03,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Next slide, please.

595
00:49:06,536 --> 00:49:06,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

596
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:25,722
[SPEAKER_06]: This first column here, I know it's a lot of words, but I just wanted to show everyone, this first column are the four options that HMFH gave us as to at the end of their space study, here are some things that you could look at.

597
00:49:26,683 --> 00:49:30,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we did here internally is say like,

598
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:44,447
[SPEAKER_06]: for each option, are renovations involved, is redistricting within the city involved, are there going to be increased transportation needs, and then just some like additional notes to consider.

599
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:48,752
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first option was basically like everything stays the same.

600
00:49:50,678 --> 00:49:59,782
[SPEAKER_06]: the four elementary schools, nothing changes, but you just look at each building, specifically the Roberts and the Brooks, to see where we can free up space.

601
00:50:00,742 --> 00:50:03,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And so does that require renovation, potentially?

602
00:50:04,003 --> 00:50:10,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it require redistricting, maybe potentially, especially where some of the MEPS are considered?

603
00:50:11,126 --> 00:50:17,809
[SPEAKER_06]: And then are there transportation needs, potentially, if we're looking at programs and space?

604
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:31,476
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think what's important to note is that because of the varying capacity and enrollment from school to school, that additional space that we would find is limited for multi-use.

605
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,898
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like not evenly distributed across all four schools.

606
00:50:35,439 --> 00:50:41,462
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are going to find greater capacity at the Missituk and less at the other three buildings.

607
00:50:43,704 --> 00:50:45,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Option two, which

608
00:50:47,003 --> 00:51:01,426
[SPEAKER_06]: I will just paraphrase for what HMFH has listed here, but option two is basically to say that the elementary schools become K-4, the McGlynn Middle becomes a 5-6, and the Andrews becomes a 7-8.

609
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:09,828
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that option, for just an initial review, will that involve renovations potentially, redistricting?

610
00:51:09,928 --> 00:51:10,228
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

611
00:51:10,548 --> 00:51:11,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Transportation?

612
00:51:11,249 --> 00:51:11,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

613
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:21,884
[SPEAKER_06]: We would now have to be talking about transporting 5th grade students as well as 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students.

614
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:35,071
[SPEAKER_06]: It would create additional space in all four elementary schools and it would remove the need for a middle school assignment process because every student would go to the McGlynn and every student would go to the Andrews.

615
00:51:37,118 --> 00:51:58,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Option three and four were a little out of the box, but option three here, they suggested that the McGlynn becomes entirely middle school and kindergarten, and then that the Andrews would take the fifth grade from the Brooks, the Misituck, and the Roberts, and one through four from the McGlynn.

616
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:05,844
[SPEAKER_06]: So for us, that would require renovation, redistricting, and transportation.

617
00:52:07,426 --> 00:52:14,933
[SPEAKER_06]: To equip a middle school space to now take in first graders is definitely going to require renovation.

618
00:52:16,157 --> 00:52:18,498
[SPEAKER_06]: and the newly built McGlynn playground.

619
00:52:19,498 --> 00:52:24,360
[SPEAKER_06]: That access, though the Andrews is on campus to the McGlynn, it's not adjacent.

620
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:39,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And so walking first graders or second graders from the McGlynn to be able to use that playground also just seems like another barrier, and it would impact time on learning.

621
00:52:41,647 --> 00:53:01,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Similar rationale for option four, which is very similar, but instead of kindergarten, the McGlynn becomes, we put all the pre-K at the McGlynn, plus the middle school grades, and then the Andrews takes the fifth grade from the Brooks, the Misituck, and the Roberts, and again, K to four from the McGlynn.

622
00:53:03,775 --> 00:53:07,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Same rationale, it would require that even like

623
00:53:10,002 --> 00:53:28,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Still, that requires the renovation to equip middle school spaces to take on younger students, definitely redistricting if we're bringing all pre-K to the option before all K, definitely increase in transportation, and again, not direct access to the playground.

624
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:35,530
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

625
00:53:36,632 --> 00:53:45,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So the recommendation from the district is that based on this utilization study, we would recommend a further review of option two.

626
00:53:47,503 --> 00:53:50,545
[SPEAKER_06]: It would not be for next school year, 26-27.

627
00:53:50,665 --> 00:53:56,407
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be a further review for school year 27-28.

628
00:53:57,708 --> 00:54:05,011
[SPEAKER_06]: We do feel that option two requires a further review with a committee of varied stakeholders.

629
00:54:05,731 --> 00:54:11,394
[SPEAKER_06]: We do think that it could effectively address immediate and long-term needs for the district.

630
00:54:12,034 --> 00:54:15,035
[SPEAKER_06]: and minimize disruption to the greater community.

631
00:54:15,575 --> 00:54:24,818
[SPEAKER_06]: We do think it's the most balanced and cost effective for the district and the needs of the existing facilities.

632
00:54:25,858 --> 00:54:33,121
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also it addresses the middle school, it allows us to address the middle school programming.

633
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:36,002
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would eliminate the lottery process for entry.

634
00:54:36,642 --> 00:54:39,723
[SPEAKER_06]: As I previously stated, all students would go to both

635
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,941
[SPEAKER_06]: the McGlynn and then the Andrews.

636
00:54:44,262 --> 00:54:52,847
[SPEAKER_06]: This would also address demographic disparities between the two schools based on the programming that is happening right now at the two schools.

637
00:54:53,928 --> 00:55:04,995
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would eliminate that programming piece where some programs are at the McGlynn specialized programs for EL and special education, and some are at the Andrews.

638
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,498
[SPEAKER_06]: This would mean that we would have programming at both.

639
00:55:12,147 --> 00:55:37,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that said, what we see as next steps would be, as mentioned during the subcommittee meeting last year, the establishment of a task force to further review option two, which we believe is the most valuable option, to partner with the existing school teams in that work to explore and identify actual capacity,

640
00:55:38,287 --> 00:55:45,409
[SPEAKER_06]: and then create advisory deliverables to this committee and to inform planning for school year 27-28.

641
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:57,332
[SPEAKER_06]: We would say that the development of this task force would be that we're gathering stakeholder interest in early January so that we are convening this work.

642
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:06,705
[SPEAKER_06]: late January so that we can be finished in a reasonable amount of time so that we're able to present at the end of the year to the school committee.

643
00:56:07,725 --> 00:56:24,677
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for next year, we would, for middle school assignment, continue to use the existing lottery system that is currently in place and has been in place for the past seven years to assign sixth grade students for school year 26-27.

644
00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:37,961
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that's a lot to probably take in, but at this time, I'm happy to answer questions and have a conversation.

645
00:56:41,124 --> 00:56:42,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Pippicelli.

646
00:56:44,327 --> 00:56:46,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Galusi.

647
00:56:47,749 --> 00:56:48,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau?

648
00:56:50,401 --> 00:56:50,841
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

649
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:57,564
[SPEAKER_17]: I really am happy to see that slides just an option to because that was after reading those options.

650
00:56:57,624 --> 00:56:59,105
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, please let that be the one.

651
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:04,488
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm especially excited for the, you know, one of the things that we

652
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:15,301
[SPEAKER_17]: have talked about in the past is that students with certain types of disabilities don't really get a choice as to which middle school.

653
00:57:15,961 --> 00:57:18,302
[SPEAKER_17]: They're out of the lottery.

654
00:57:19,863 --> 00:57:30,468
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I'm excited that we will no longer have essentially a class of students that doesn't get the same choice that other students get, the same for our Yale students.

655
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:36,411
[SPEAKER_17]: From an equity perspective, I'm very excited about this.

656
00:57:36,631 --> 00:57:53,435
[SPEAKER_17]: I am curious, and I realize that that's part of what the committee that will be created to do this will have to investigate, is I'm curious about how that will affect programming at the elementary schools around special ed.

657
00:57:53,635 --> 00:57:56,755
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we have EL at all the schools.

658
00:57:56,875 --> 00:58:00,136
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't think we have newcomers at all the schools.

659
00:58:00,356 --> 00:58:02,597
[SPEAKER_17]: So it would be interesting to see if we can

660
00:58:04,423 --> 00:58:11,968
[SPEAKER_17]: solve that problem of, you know, some students have to go from one grade to another and change to a different school.

661
00:58:12,308 --> 00:58:13,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Or we used to have that.

662
00:58:13,109 --> 00:58:14,410
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure the current layout.

663
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:24,396
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like, I feel like the middle school equity part is almost just solved by default with this approach.

664
00:58:25,036 --> 00:58:26,617
[SPEAKER_17]: But I would like to know how that

665
00:58:27,658 --> 00:58:36,542
[SPEAKER_17]: What what areas of equity we are still missing at the elementary level that we could really, um, maybe drive this all the way home.

666
00:58:37,562 --> 00:58:39,523
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you for the presentation.

667
00:58:39,563 --> 00:58:45,145
[SPEAKER_17]: I look forward to hearing from the group of people that will provide recommendations.

668
00:58:46,626 --> 00:58:46,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

669
00:58:48,586 --> 00:58:49,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember.

670
00:58:58,145 --> 00:59:00,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you weren't muted, so I went with you, I wasn't sure.

671
00:59:00,887 --> 00:59:01,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Olapade.

672
00:59:02,989 --> 00:59:03,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thank you so much.

673
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:05,071
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you for this presentation.

674
00:59:05,091 --> 00:59:09,815
[SPEAKER_12]: This gives some really good, I think, insight into this next step, and I'm really excited for the prospect of it.

675
00:59:11,197 --> 00:59:13,899
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure that the task force will kind of go into the nitty gritty of this.

676
00:59:13,939 --> 00:59:19,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, this is kind of a very, like, altitude level approach to this discussion since we're so early in.

677
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:30,974
[SPEAKER_12]: When we talk about transportation, I know that's going to be one of the biggest conversations that are going to come up just with navigating, at least with option two, fifth graders all now going to the McGlynn and the Brooks, for example.

678
00:59:31,514 --> 00:59:38,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Have we thought about what the costs will be about rerouting buses and busing in that regard?

679
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,842
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that we already have that bus routing already set up.

680
00:59:41,302 --> 00:59:52,907
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know that's going to be a big conversation for a lot of parents, especially about navigating timeline about students schedules and how it's going to shift probably more drastically than we may first initially envision.

681
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:59,029
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, that may be a more task force conversation as we kind of get into it, but just something that I'm wondering about.

682
01:00:00,190 --> 01:00:01,911
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other portion of that is

683
01:00:04,105 --> 01:00:11,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have a set of criteria or deliverables for the April, May 26 presentation we're looking for?

684
01:00:11,328 --> 01:00:16,350
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we do, could we have that sent to us just so that we have that physical copy as well?

685
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:18,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Two great questions.

686
01:00:19,706 --> 01:00:22,929
[SPEAKER_06]: First, for the transportation, I agree.

687
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:41,667
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's another reason why I'm very grateful that we have a dedicated position now to transportation with somebody with that expertise that has done this job in other districts, who will be, I think, a key person to participate on this task force.

688
01:00:42,527 --> 01:00:44,768
[SPEAKER_06]: and be able to kind of have those conversations.

689
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:52,890
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a lot of data that we're going to have to review, look into, and run some numbers.

690
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:58,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I think when we do get to that part of the work with the task force, happy to share.

691
01:00:58,712 --> 01:01:01,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that would definitely be part of the deliverables.

692
01:01:02,733 --> 01:01:06,294
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think, you know, one of the things I want to say too on this call is that

693
01:01:07,656 --> 01:01:09,218
[SPEAKER_06]: this is not like set in stone.

694
01:01:09,258 --> 01:01:11,019
[SPEAKER_06]: This does not mean like this is what we're doing.

695
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:18,067
[SPEAKER_06]: It just means that as a result of the space utilization study, let's do right by the data that's in front of us.

696
01:01:18,487 --> 01:01:21,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just explore a little bit more.

697
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:24,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it even viable to do this option?

698
01:01:24,954 --> 01:01:28,978
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I would say that a lot of the deliverables are going to be around

699
01:01:29,793 --> 01:01:48,048
[SPEAKER_06]: the actual viability of what is it going to take to be able to do this, because I would say if we're going to entertain it, I could see deliverables being somewhat scenario-based, because it's going to involve some level of renovation.

700
01:01:49,699 --> 01:02:04,129
[SPEAKER_06]: you have the transportation costs, but in order to maybe make some of the spaces we need to, I think even if it's something as simple as like putting up a wall, there's going to be some sort of level of renovation.

701
01:02:04,189 --> 01:02:17,798
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think what this report is gonna have to detail very transparently is what would have to be involved in order to fulfill option two, if it's possible at all.

702
01:02:19,312 --> 01:02:20,432
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense?

703
01:02:20,452 --> 01:02:21,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's great.

704
01:02:21,293 --> 01:02:21,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

705
01:02:24,214 --> 01:02:24,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

706
01:02:25,474 --> 01:02:25,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

707
01:02:26,014 --> 01:02:31,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham, Member Ntapo, and then we have Josh.

708
01:02:33,817 --> 01:02:34,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

709
01:02:37,859 --> 01:02:41,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree that this, at this point, appears to be our best option.

710
01:02:42,003 --> 01:02:52,612
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this study from HMFH was really good and important to help us debunk our own opinions about what happens in our buildings.

711
01:02:53,293 --> 01:03:03,802
[SPEAKER_11]: These buildings are busting at the seams, and they are in their current configuration, but they clearly identified that there's more than meets the eye, which I think is really important.

712
01:03:04,803 --> 01:03:18,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I think I just want to flag that as this task force is, like, doing its work, we're going to start receiving a bunch of information about our community driven input from our strategic plan.

713
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:19,190
[SPEAKER_11]: And.

714
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:22,792
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like this task force as they think about.

715
01:03:23,997 --> 01:03:32,780
[SPEAKER_11]: this question of how do we do this, to also think about anything that we're going to collect or glean through that process about middle school.

716
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:41,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Because let's say the overwhelming feedback is middle school should have an X class that it doesn't have right now.

717
01:03:42,063 --> 01:03:48,105
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, if we're planning on making changes to buildings, and schedules, and structures,

718
01:03:48,905 --> 01:03:54,206
[SPEAKER_11]: all of that stuff, really sort of thinking about all of that at the same time, like, seems to make a lot of sense to me.

719
01:03:54,326 --> 01:04:03,308
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would want this group to certainly be able to, like, raise the flag, like, hey, this actually isn't viable for these reasons, right?

720
01:04:03,328 --> 01:04:04,928
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think that's one possibility.

721
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:11,990
[SPEAKER_11]: But more importantly, to, like, take sort of a broader lens to what they're going to consider and say,

722
01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,411
[SPEAKER_11]: What is the right way for us to do middle school?

723
01:04:15,571 --> 01:04:16,812
[SPEAKER_11]: And can we get there?

724
01:04:17,212 --> 01:04:20,393
[SPEAKER_11]: How do we get there in this like reconfigured model?

725
01:04:21,013 --> 01:04:23,494
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think there's like a sort of a broader mission.

726
01:04:23,534 --> 01:04:24,955
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think there's lots of questions.

727
01:04:24,975 --> 01:04:26,856
[SPEAKER_11]: There's like a financial aspect of this.

728
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,356
[SPEAKER_11]: There's the transportation aspect.

729
01:04:28,856 --> 01:04:31,378
[SPEAKER_11]: There's like what classes should we be teaching?

730
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:34,799
[SPEAKER_11]: Like in a five, six school, does it work the same way as middle school now?

731
01:04:34,839 --> 01:04:40,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Like there's a million questions for us to think about and answer and be thoughtful about.

732
01:04:40,501 --> 01:04:41,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's really important.

733
01:04:42,848 --> 01:04:46,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so I'm, you know, I'm hopeful that we can, like, sort of.

734
01:04:47,131 --> 01:04:51,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Start to meld these 2 efforts together as they, as they continue towards the April May timeframe.

735
01:04:52,655 --> 01:05:07,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but I, I personally think that the committee needs to say, yes, this is where we want to go because otherwise, like, it's, it's very amorphous for a task force to, like.

736
01:05:08,447 --> 01:05:09,768
[SPEAKER_11]: have a kind of charge.

737
01:05:11,570 --> 01:05:14,372
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's like 10 people on the call tonight.

738
01:05:14,572 --> 01:05:16,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of them are people who work at MPS.

739
01:05:17,575 --> 01:05:27,943
[SPEAKER_11]: And what I don't want to do is say have us like take some sort of a vote tonight that then tomorrow everyone's like the school committee voted to do this thing and they didn't even tell us about it.

740
01:05:28,484 --> 01:05:30,625
[SPEAKER_11]: So because that's fair.

741
01:05:32,007 --> 01:05:35,429
[SPEAKER_11]: So what I kind of am thinking about is

742
01:05:36,722 --> 01:05:44,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we table this for a vote at our next meeting and between now and then we let the public know that.

743
01:05:44,889 --> 01:05:56,299
[SPEAKER_11]: We are considering a reconfiguration at our middle schools that will have impacts to both elementary and middle and that we that in this reconfiguration, it will not happen.

744
01:05:57,470 --> 01:06:10,486
[SPEAKER_11]: In August of this year, but instead we're planning for the future and that what we are inviting input on in our next meeting are the kinds of things people want the task force to consider so that.

745
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:16,113
[SPEAKER_11]: We can create some space to collect some of that information before the task force gets going.

746
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:27,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Instead of like the task force comes to us and presents, you know, here's what we think and here's what we recommend and then then people come in and they're like, did you think about this and this and this and this and this?

747
01:06:27,824 --> 01:06:28,044
[SPEAKER_11]: So.

748
01:06:28,064 --> 01:06:40,977
[SPEAKER_11]: I think what I would like to do, uh, let other people chat before I do this, but is to make a motion to table this to next week with some promotion of like, this, this consideration being out there so that.

749
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:55,769
[SPEAKER_11]: if there are people who want to talk about what the task force, the scope of the task force is or the kinds of questions they're going to be asked to answer that we can hear that from people before and not after the task force feels like it's done.

750
01:06:55,789 --> 01:06:58,750
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

751
01:06:58,930 --> 01:06:59,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

752
01:06:59,491 --> 01:07:00,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Intoppa.

753
01:07:01,272 --> 01:07:02,713
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Member Reinfeld.

754
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:05,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, thank you all for this information.

755
01:07:05,334 --> 01:07:08,836
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll actually, you know, preemptively second that motion with the amendment of

756
01:07:10,428 --> 01:07:15,892
[SPEAKER_13]: for the December 1st meeting to earmark that for the December 1st meetings that I believe is the next meeting that we have.

757
01:07:17,374 --> 01:07:22,558
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll also say, so we're talking a lot about a lot of stuff and what this option looks like and reverting to things.

758
01:07:22,618 --> 01:07:32,386
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question about staffing and a question about how our faculty will be impacted by this change in terms of retention with faculty.

759
01:07:32,746 --> 01:07:39,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we expecting, I mean, obviously this is something that the task force would look at, but are we expecting to retain all of our faculty or are we expecting that this will

760
01:07:40,692 --> 01:08:05,925
[SPEAKER_13]: lessen positions, bring up positions, keep them the same in terms of how class sizes are impacted by funneling all of one, by making this switch with option two, what does that look like just to get ahead of any rumor mill or ahead of any anxieties that may occur?

761
01:08:06,025 --> 01:08:08,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Because when I hear this, that's immediately where I think of is I think of,

762
01:08:10,082 --> 01:08:11,463
[SPEAKER_13]: How are faculty impacted?

763
01:08:12,664 --> 01:08:13,585
[SPEAKER_13]: What do jobs look like?

764
01:08:13,665 --> 01:08:15,366
[SPEAKER_13]: What do position numbers look like?

765
01:08:15,927 --> 01:08:19,409
[SPEAKER_13]: FTEs, all that fun numbers stuff that we do every budget season.

766
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:21,971
[SPEAKER_13]: How is that impacted?

767
01:08:21,991 --> 01:08:28,136
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not sure if there's any initial thoughts about that or if we have to wait until the committee meets.

768
01:08:28,196 --> 01:08:34,861
[SPEAKER_13]: And like member Graham said, I completely concur with the idea of like, we don't want anyone to think we're taking a motion tonight to put this into effect, to do this.

769
01:08:34,921 --> 01:08:38,084
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't want that narrative because unfortunately,

770
01:08:38,665 --> 01:08:47,792
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, we just don't want to scare anyone in terms of that we're making this huge change suddenly and that this will come into play in August and all of that.

771
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:54,117
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's my initial question is what are we looking at with staffing?

772
01:08:55,118 --> 01:09:02,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I think that's why it was important for me to say that it's not for next year.

773
01:09:03,284 --> 01:09:05,226
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also is not a definite

774
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,940
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a definite decision.

775
01:09:08,461 --> 01:09:10,561
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one that just warrants another review.

776
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:13,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a balance.

777
01:09:13,342 --> 01:09:17,423
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're in total partnership all the time with our teachers.

778
01:09:17,443 --> 01:09:20,044
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is not about, you know, reducing.

779
01:09:20,084 --> 01:09:27,786
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about, we also heard teachers come to school committee meetings to talk about the overcrowding at some of our schools.

780
01:09:27,966 --> 01:09:32,427
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, you know, some of this work was also in response

781
01:09:33,167 --> 01:09:35,229
[SPEAKER_06]: to like their input.

782
01:09:35,369 --> 01:09:45,498
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think just taking a closer look at what our options and our possibilities are is where we are in this process.

783
01:09:46,659 --> 01:09:49,821
[SPEAKER_06]: When we get, and also for the task force, I mean

784
01:09:50,927 --> 01:10:00,079
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, I welcome, you know, teachers' perspective and participation on the task force.

785
01:10:00,099 --> 01:10:07,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, it's great if this should be an opportunity for varied stakeholders to dig into the work.

786
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:26,230
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would say as we go along, this has to be we have monthly joint labor meetings with our teachers, and we're just starting up with our paraprofessionals so I do imagine that this would be like ongoing conversation, so that

787
01:10:27,981 --> 01:10:30,622
[SPEAKER_06]: people feel like they understand what is happening.

788
01:10:30,782 --> 01:10:46,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when we get to a point of advisory as to what we feel our next steps should be, then I would imagine the appropriate conversations will happen as a result of what the advisory is.

789
01:10:48,928 --> 01:10:49,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

790
01:10:49,528 --> 01:10:57,151
[SPEAKER_13]: And I understand all that, but my question still stands of preliminary, do we think that staffing changes will occur in terms of like-

791
01:10:58,697 --> 01:10:59,338
[SPEAKER_13]: What was that?

792
01:11:01,701 --> 01:11:03,723
[SPEAKER_08]: We just don't know that as of yet, right?

793
01:11:04,244 --> 01:11:05,065
[SPEAKER_08]: But Dr. Guzzi.

794
01:11:05,125 --> 01:11:06,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, then that's a viable answer too.

795
01:11:06,827 --> 01:11:08,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Like if we don't know, we don't know.

796
01:11:08,148 --> 01:11:11,933
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just wanted to put it out there and ask, do we know?

797
01:11:12,053 --> 01:11:13,294
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we don't know, we don't know.

798
01:11:14,135 --> 01:11:16,038
[SPEAKER_13]: But if we do know, I'd like to know.

799
01:11:17,416 --> 01:11:19,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I, we haven't done the work.

800
01:11:19,717 --> 01:11:20,517
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know.

801
01:11:21,477 --> 01:11:34,281
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I've updated you with what the what HMFH said and the further dive that we need to do with a task force.

802
01:11:35,462 --> 01:11:36,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

803
01:11:37,452 --> 01:11:37,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

804
01:11:38,653 --> 01:11:39,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld?

805
01:11:39,754 --> 01:11:40,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, I won't.

806
01:11:40,694 --> 01:11:44,797
[SPEAKER_09]: So my colleagues covered a lot of the things I was jotting down, so thank you.

807
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:45,718
[SPEAKER_09]: Won't repeat.

808
01:11:47,079 --> 01:11:50,601
[SPEAKER_09]: I have one question and one comment left that I haven't crossed out yet.

809
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:59,748
[SPEAKER_09]: In our strategic planning subcommittee, we talked about looking at the MISA TUC in particular for some early childhood focused.

810
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:01,249
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't see that on the list.

811
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:06,513
[SPEAKER_09]: We also got some negative feedback about that from the public on our,

812
01:12:07,033 --> 01:12:21,797
[SPEAKER_09]: on our call, but I'm wondering what happened to that thinking or did that just get absorbed into, well, we're looking at a high school that has space for early childhood, so let's not implement that change and then have to implement a new change.

813
01:12:22,477 --> 01:12:27,998
[SPEAKER_09]: And then my comment is around the type of learning that's going to be occurring in these spaces.

814
01:12:28,038 --> 01:12:35,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Graham covered a little bit in terms of what does a late elementary school and early middle school look like now that we're thinking there's a middle school and a junior high.

815
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,220
[SPEAKER_09]: or however we frame that.

816
01:12:38,641 --> 01:12:45,222
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was a little bit appalled when you said that the space company didn't look at some of the special education spaces.

817
01:12:45,822 --> 01:12:49,723
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I really, really don't want that to be an afterthought.

818
01:12:50,483 --> 01:13:03,106
[SPEAKER_09]: And particularly as we're looking at the equity across the different grade levels and the different schools, the type of learning that is happening in these classrooms and the need, the student need, the teacher need, the community need in these classrooms.

819
01:13:03,286 --> 01:13:05,867
[SPEAKER_09]: I really hope that this task force will be

820
01:13:07,048 --> 01:13:09,430
[SPEAKER_09]: really focused on that.

821
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:16,096
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like I really appreciate what the space utilization study showed us and what HFMFN did.

822
01:13:16,116 --> 01:13:18,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I got the letters wrong.

823
01:13:19,899 --> 01:13:25,444
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of that was the number of students and the space available and doing that math, right?

824
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I think options three and four were

825
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:39,026
[SPEAKER_09]: surprising to me, not just because of the playground, but thinking about we've got middle schoolers and kindergartners, and I already hear about the McGlynn cafeteria and the choice vocabulary people are learning.

826
01:13:40,106 --> 01:13:43,869
[SPEAKER_09]: So all this to say, I think this is a really good start.

827
01:13:43,889 --> 01:13:44,670
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate

828
01:13:46,795 --> 01:14:00,364
[SPEAKER_09]: getting some input before we officially vote to study it further, and just being aware that the Thanksgiving holiday is between our next meeting and our next meeting is the day a lot of people are getting back from family activities or travel.

829
01:14:01,105 --> 01:14:07,109
[SPEAKER_09]: So making sure we get this messaging out early and not as people are leaving for a Thanksgiving break.

830
01:14:07,589 --> 01:14:09,851
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, and I look forward to the next steps.

831
01:14:11,232 --> 01:14:11,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that.

832
01:14:11,852 --> 01:14:12,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

833
01:14:13,013 --> 01:14:14,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it okay if I quickly respond?

834
01:14:15,014 --> 01:14:15,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Dr. Galussi.

835
01:14:16,832 --> 01:14:17,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that.

836
01:14:17,473 --> 01:14:20,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Will and I can do that pretty quickly.

837
01:14:23,036 --> 01:14:29,161
[SPEAKER_06]: The MISTITUC was one of the things that internally the district looked at as a possible long-term solution.

838
01:14:29,181 --> 01:14:34,484
[SPEAKER_06]: HMFH did not have that in their options.

839
01:14:35,425 --> 01:14:41,369
[SPEAKER_06]: We could always go back to them, and that's something that maybe through the task force, if that's something that we want to look at.

840
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:51,117
[SPEAKER_06]: might require additional funding, but you never know with these things, but they did not bring that up as a suggestion.

841
01:14:51,137 --> 01:14:56,061
[SPEAKER_06]: And I agree around the type of learning.

842
01:14:56,341 --> 01:15:00,085
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I want to clarify about the space is

843
01:15:01,818 --> 01:15:11,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Their criteria, again, so they did look at some of the special education classrooms, just in case people have the same kind of wondering as they're listening to this.

844
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:16,289
[SPEAKER_06]: They were reflected in those additional potential classrooms to look at.

845
01:15:16,849 --> 01:15:25,376
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wasn't because it's a special classroom, a subseparate classroom, a service provider classroom.

846
01:15:25,976 --> 01:15:27,998
[SPEAKER_06]: It really was the size of the room,

847
01:15:29,212 --> 01:15:31,613
[SPEAKER_06]: in relation to the amount of students in the space.

848
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:39,937
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was a flag for the district to look and say, is this a space that we could repurpose?

849
01:15:40,097 --> 01:15:47,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the number of students is not at the class level cap that it can be.

850
01:15:48,341 --> 01:15:54,444
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do know that depending on the programs, maybe for some of them we could look into that, but not all.

851
01:15:55,104 --> 01:15:58,826
[SPEAKER_06]: And so for some of our programs, we need additional space.

852
01:15:59,266 --> 01:16:04,168
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was just a little flag for the district to have those internal conversations.

853
01:16:04,809 --> 01:16:11,512
[SPEAKER_06]: The pieces that surprised me were in some of the schools, there were like internal classrooms that weren't necessarily

854
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:20,341
[SPEAKER_06]: flagged by HMFH that I'm very interested in having the task force look at.

855
01:16:20,821 --> 01:16:34,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of those internal classrooms are around what our specialist classrooms are being currently used as, so art, tech lab, spaces like that.

856
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:39,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not taking, we're not like, you know, doing anything right now, but just to take

857
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:44,511
[SPEAKER_06]: of make sure we're not leaving any stone unturned.

858
01:16:50,733 --> 01:16:51,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham?

859
01:16:53,495 --> 01:17:02,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just also wanted to mention that I think the staffing question that was raised by Member Intoppa is a fair, a good and fair one.

860
01:17:03,379 --> 01:17:10,342
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think before we can talk about that question, we have to talk about what is going to happen in the building and how do we like

861
01:17:10,762 --> 01:17:15,364
[SPEAKER_11]: re-envision how we meet the needs because it's not exactly the same.

862
01:17:15,825 --> 01:17:19,246
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the end of the day, we're still educating the same number of kids.

863
01:17:19,467 --> 01:17:29,311
[SPEAKER_11]: So we might not do it exactly the same way that we've always done it, but it's too soon to say yes or no or something in the middle.

864
01:17:29,412 --> 01:17:39,677
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the end of the day, we have the same number of kids to educate and hopefully a growing number of kids to educate as more students decide to stick with MPS.

865
01:17:40,337 --> 01:17:50,964
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that is a question for the task force, like the finance side of the task force to that, but not until we've decided how do we educate students?

866
01:17:51,144 --> 01:17:52,425
[SPEAKER_11]: What does middle school look like?

867
01:17:52,765 --> 01:17:53,866
[SPEAKER_11]: What supports are needed?

868
01:17:54,006 --> 01:17:59,069
[SPEAKER_11]: And how does that change as we move into these new thing, into these new structures?

869
01:17:59,169 --> 01:18:01,531
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's very much on my mind.

870
01:18:01,591 --> 01:18:08,415
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think there's a whole slew of things that we have to decide and a whole slew of opportunities to evaluate before we get there.

871
01:18:11,568 --> 01:18:12,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Graham.

872
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:14,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Josh, name and address for the record.

873
01:18:17,769 --> 01:18:18,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Ah, good evening.

874
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:21,532
[SPEAKER_16]: Josh Terrell, 86 Newbern Avenue.

875
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:23,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Long-time listener, first-time caller.

876
01:18:25,255 --> 01:18:28,098
[SPEAKER_16]: I've lived in South Medford for almost 10 years now.

877
01:18:28,818 --> 01:18:33,202
[SPEAKER_16]: I've got two young children, and my son is heading to the Missituk for kindergarten next year.

878
01:18:34,563 --> 01:18:41,349
[SPEAKER_16]: So, in regards to the school use report, I actually didn't plan for this, but member Reinfeld and Dr. Galusi really teed up my question.

879
01:18:43,231 --> 01:18:54,020
[SPEAKER_16]: If the recommended models by HMFH frees up classroom space across the district, my question is, could some of that space be used to expand access to full-time pre-K?

880
01:18:55,542 --> 01:19:04,690
[SPEAKER_16]: I usually hold court at Tufts Park, and a lot of the parents of the playground tell me the MEET program and the staff are wonderful, but the schedule is just impossible.

881
01:19:06,151 --> 01:19:09,193
[SPEAKER_16]: The issue isn't about like program quality, it's just availability.

882
01:19:10,074 --> 01:19:16,679
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we personally were offered 10 hours a week at Misatoch for our son, and we had to opt out for something private that met our needs.

883
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:30,089
[SPEAKER_16]: So, if this reconfiguration suggests space can be gained, even if the gains are modest, I feel like it's worth asking whether this is an avenue to expand programming in the long term, not just rebalance.

884
01:19:31,890 --> 01:19:39,759
[SPEAKER_16]: I have more questions than answers about this right now, but I'd love to see the topic of expanding pre-K added to future agendas for broader public comment.

885
01:19:42,322 --> 01:19:43,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Josh.

886
01:19:44,103 --> 01:19:45,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, really appreciate that.

887
01:19:45,283 --> 01:20:06,132
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do think it's important to note that through the MSBA process that we're going through at Medford High School, our educational plan includes the creation of an early childhood center, which would bring preschool, our municipal daycare, MFN,

888
01:20:07,772 --> 01:20:10,973
[SPEAKER_06]: all in one space up here at the high school.

889
01:20:11,193 --> 01:20:24,718
[SPEAKER_06]: And part of that was because we do want to have conversations about what would it mean to increase not only the capacity for preschool programming, but also full day preschool programs.

890
01:20:24,738 --> 01:20:28,419
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is part of the ongoing conversation.

891
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:35,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't necessarily give a timeline to it, but I do think it's worth a further dive.

892
01:20:38,313 --> 01:20:39,135
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Lucy.

893
01:20:42,281 --> 01:20:43,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham has her hand up.

894
01:20:46,669 --> 01:20:47,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Member Graham.

895
01:20:48,428 --> 01:20:51,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, you can hear my dog whining in the background here.

896
01:20:52,372 --> 01:20:53,373
[SPEAKER_11]: She decided to join us.

897
01:20:53,994 --> 01:21:12,472
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have a motion, which I'm going to put in the chat so that people can read it or copy it if they need to, so that we are on the record, which is the motion would be to table the recommendation to adopt option two, which would move all elementary schools to pre-K to four, change our McGlynn Middle School to five to six,

898
01:21:13,012 --> 01:21:26,038
[SPEAKER_11]: and change our Andrews middle to seven to eight upon validation of the feasibility of the decision to be a decision by the to be formed middle school transition task force until our December 2nd meeting.

899
01:21:26,618 --> 01:21:37,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Further request that the administration invite the public to attend the 12-2 meeting to provide input on the scope of the questions and considerations to be addressed by the task force.

900
01:21:37,363 --> 01:21:38,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, amendment 12-1, okay.

901
01:21:42,917 --> 01:21:44,318
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy to take that amendment.

902
01:21:44,658 --> 01:22:04,172
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm also going to add in this change would take effect in the 27, 28 school year, just so that that's clear as well.

903
01:22:04,272 --> 01:22:05,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Hold on, I'm just retyping.

904
01:22:05,433 --> 01:22:06,814
[SPEAKER_17]: I already got it.

905
01:22:08,763 --> 01:22:11,264
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just going to put it in the chat.

906
01:22:12,144 --> 01:22:17,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so that is the, uh, motion.

907
01:22:20,308 --> 01:22:20,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

908
01:22:20,608 --> 01:22:26,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to table by member Graham and I believe member on top of you earlier said you wanted to second it.

909
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:30,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, but I'll also mention that, um, if it.

910
01:22:31,668 --> 01:22:33,469
[SPEAKER_13]: be take kindly to the amendment of removing the 2728.

911
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:55,182
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it provides clarity, but in case the recommendation is that we need a further delay to change things around, I don't want to pin us to 2728 if we, unless this has no, not that it doesn't matter, but unless it doesn't pin us to 2728, but I know the intention is to say it's not going to happen in 2627, but I just don't want to make it so that way we are forced to then do 2720.

912
01:22:56,691 --> 01:23:00,214
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's the upon validation of the feasibility part.

913
01:23:00,654 --> 01:23:12,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it could be happening later, but I want to be really clear because what I don't want is a bunch of parents to feel like they need to truck themselves out on December 1st to say, you haven't thought this through.

914
01:23:12,745 --> 01:23:16,768
[SPEAKER_11]: There isn't enough time because we're not intending to do this this year.

915
01:23:16,849 --> 01:23:18,270
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's not on the table.

916
01:23:19,351 --> 01:23:23,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Can we put it in at the earliest, the 27, 28 school year early school year?

917
01:23:24,842 --> 01:23:25,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Would that work?

918
01:23:25,703 --> 01:23:26,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that an okay amendment to make?

919
01:23:27,404 --> 01:23:29,445
[SPEAKER_13]: And if so, I'll second.

920
01:23:33,628 --> 01:23:36,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to approve by member Graham.

921
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:40,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to table amended by member Intoppa.

922
01:23:41,174 --> 01:23:41,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau?

923
01:23:43,095 --> 01:23:49,820
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, I just think that it's important to, when we direct others to do work, to set an expectation.

924
01:23:52,164 --> 01:23:56,610
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, are overcrowding is a perennial issue?

925
01:23:58,671 --> 01:24:08,478
[SPEAKER_17]: We receive numerous communications from parents and a lot of freaking out at the beginning of every school year about we have to add another kindergarten classroom.

926
01:24:08,558 --> 01:24:12,881
[SPEAKER_17]: But I mean, my own husband works in a kindergarten classroom.

927
01:24:13,322 --> 01:24:16,384
[SPEAKER_17]: Essentially, it's a lovely classroom.

928
01:24:16,904 --> 01:24:22,889
[SPEAKER_17]: There isn't a window and it's in the corner and it is not intended to be a classroom.

929
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:27,032
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think the urgency of saying

930
01:24:28,252 --> 01:24:36,875
[SPEAKER_17]: The goal here is 27, 28, and let them decide that it's not possible for whatever reason, rather than giving people an out.

931
01:24:37,416 --> 01:24:39,476
[SPEAKER_17]: We're supposed to be the ones giving the direction.

932
01:24:40,217 --> 01:24:46,819
[SPEAKER_17]: And I always expect that when we give direction, if it runs into problems, people come back to us and say, we tried.

933
01:24:52,176 --> 01:24:56,678
[SPEAKER_17]: here's why we're not gonna get there, rather than giving them the out before we even tried.

934
01:24:57,258 --> 01:25:03,820
[SPEAKER_17]: But regardless, I'll, we can just take this language and move along.

935
01:25:07,162 --> 01:25:07,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham?

936
01:25:09,162 --> 01:25:09,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

937
01:25:10,883 --> 01:25:11,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

938
01:25:12,343 --> 01:25:16,605
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you're good, Member Ruseau, or would you like to remove the?

939
01:25:16,625 --> 01:25:17,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

940
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:19,906
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's fine.

941
01:25:19,926 --> 01:25:21,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, we are overcrowded, so,

942
01:25:22,241 --> 01:25:26,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody's goal is to fix this issue by 2728, but I hear what you're saying, Member Intoppa.

943
01:25:27,004 --> 01:25:31,066
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to move approval to table as amended.

944
01:25:31,727 --> 01:25:32,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call, please.

945
01:25:33,508 --> 01:25:34,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Bradley?

946
01:25:35,149 --> 01:25:35,409
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

947
01:25:36,209 --> 01:25:36,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham?

948
01:25:37,330 --> 01:25:37,490
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

949
01:25:38,231 --> 01:25:38,831
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Intoppa?

950
01:25:39,371 --> 01:25:39,611
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

951
01:25:40,232 --> 01:25:40,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Olapade?

952
01:25:41,212 --> 01:25:41,452
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

953
01:25:42,153 --> 01:25:42,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Reinfeld?

954
01:25:43,113 --> 01:25:43,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

955
01:25:43,994 --> 01:25:44,474
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Rossell?

956
01:25:44,494 --> 01:25:44,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

957
01:25:44,734 --> 01:25:45,395
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor Lincoln?

958
01:25:46,595 --> 01:25:46,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

959
01:25:46,876 --> 01:25:48,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

960
01:25:49,417 --> 01:25:50,658
[SPEAKER_08]: This motion is tabled.

961
01:25:57,668 --> 01:26:05,672
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not have any reports of subcommittees nor presentations to the public, continued business, but we do have new business.

962
01:26:05,692 --> 01:26:17,177
[SPEAKER_08]: 2025-36 offered by member Intoppa, whereas navigating and obtaining a 504 plan may be complex for families and friends of students navigating accommodations for the first time.

963
01:26:17,197 --> 01:26:26,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And be it resolved that the administration health services and student services departments will look into drafting a notice sent to families and caregivers on a yearly basis

964
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:28,701
[SPEAKER_08]: about 504 plans.

965
01:26:29,061 --> 01:26:37,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Content may include but not be limited to guidance on how to navigate, how to apply any needed documentation, what a 504 is and who qualifies.

966
01:26:38,628 --> 01:26:39,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Intoppa.

967
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:41,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor.

968
01:26:41,931 --> 01:26:56,041
[SPEAKER_13]: This motion comes out of a conversation that we had at a lovely round table surrounding allergens and surrounding families and parents and caregivers and friends of students who have major food allergies within the system.

969
01:26:56,747 --> 01:27:16,803
[SPEAKER_13]: It was talked about how navigating a 504 plan was difficult and how the community member in particular did not feel, and I don't want to misquote them, did not feel that they had the adequate resources to figure this out and to figure out that they could actually get a 504 plan for their student's allergy due to the nature of it.

970
01:27:17,822 --> 01:27:18,982
[SPEAKER_13]: and a whole bunch of other stuff.

971
01:27:19,222 --> 01:27:22,283
[SPEAKER_13]: And so this comes from just looking at what that may look like.

972
01:27:22,483 --> 01:27:26,585
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we do yearly notices for other things, you know, in the past, and I think we still do.

973
01:27:27,305 --> 01:27:29,806
[SPEAKER_13]: We do a yearly notice around gun safety and around storage.

974
01:27:30,946 --> 01:27:43,830
[SPEAKER_13]: And so just as one example, but looking at, you know, what that language looks like, what those guides kind of look like in terms of helping families understand the really intense process of 504.

975
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:45,370
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say on a personal note,

976
01:27:45,993 --> 01:27:48,455
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a 504 plan when I was in Medford Public Schools.

977
01:27:49,615 --> 01:27:56,219
[SPEAKER_13]: I was almost not granted it because that option was not given to my folks.

978
01:27:56,479 --> 01:27:58,480
[SPEAKER_13]: They were screening me for an IEP.

979
01:27:58,561 --> 01:28:11,088
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't qualify for an IEP and we almost didn't pursue that until we were presented with the thought process of doing a 504 and I was able to be properly supported in Medford Public Schools

980
01:28:13,123 --> 01:28:23,705
[SPEAKER_13]: given support systems in the Medford Public Schools to be the best student that I could with my disability and working towards different academic goals.

981
01:28:23,985 --> 01:28:25,405
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what this motion is.

982
01:28:25,565 --> 01:28:28,926
[SPEAKER_13]: It's to look at what that language looks like, to what other resources may look like.

983
01:28:29,006 --> 01:28:37,888
[SPEAKER_13]: It's to really spark a conversation around making sure that our families know what a 504 is and know how to get access to it, especially for those who may not

984
01:28:39,749 --> 01:28:48,341
[SPEAKER_13]: have known that, whether that be they haven't had one in the past, they don't have a child who has that in the past, they didn't have one, or they are not aware of other families that have done so.

985
01:28:54,933 --> 01:28:56,895
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Dr. Galusi, I figured you'd want to respond.

986
01:28:56,995 --> 01:28:57,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

987
01:28:59,618 --> 01:29:10,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the, what I think is very important that Member Intoppa has raised is just that like the need for continuous communication or making sure parents know

988
01:29:11,732 --> 01:29:20,137
[SPEAKER_06]: where to go to find supports or resources that they feel they may need or at least want to discuss.

989
01:29:20,977 --> 01:29:28,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make it very clear that a 504 plan follows an eligibility process just like an IEP does.

990
01:29:29,162 --> 01:29:31,583
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they can't just be given.

991
01:29:32,004 --> 01:29:38,047
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a formal process with a team, with caregivers, with a school-based team.

992
01:29:39,628 --> 01:29:42,449
[SPEAKER_06]: We do have on our website a lot of information.

993
01:29:44,429 --> 01:29:44,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

994
01:29:44,689 --> 01:29:56,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Bone, who oversees 504s with Mr. Pivoselli, has really done like a little audit of the website to make sure that all of the information is updated and current.

995
01:29:57,231 --> 01:30:07,453
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think really happy to, at the start of every year, like especially since we have a formalized communication system with the

996
01:30:08,501 --> 01:30:22,785
[SPEAKER_06]: memo to put reminders in there about where parents can find supports for their students if need be, maybe sections on the website that help where they can find those resources.

997
01:30:24,205 --> 01:30:32,168
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to be careful about how it's communicated just so that where parents know that there is an eligibility process.

998
01:30:35,073 --> 01:30:35,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, thank you.

999
01:30:35,854 --> 01:30:39,557
[SPEAKER_13]: That's exactly why I put in the motion eligibility requirements.

1000
01:30:39,577 --> 01:30:51,248
[SPEAKER_13]: So that way people know, you know, we make sure that we're making it so known that, you know, there is an eligibility aspect, but also what are the eligibilities and what are the things that people may not realize that their student may be eligible.

1001
01:30:51,428 --> 01:30:56,793
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole point of this is to make sure that families know that if their student is eligible, that they seek it out and they go for it and they try to

1002
01:30:57,615 --> 01:31:27,006
[SPEAKER_13]: Obtain a 504 because some families may not realize that their students are eligible until it's too late and until they are in the later Grades and so all about that early intervention and notifying noticing these things now is what what this is really aiming for So I really hear what you have to say and I thank you for bringing that up Yeah, and on that website to your point on the website Miss Bowen made sure that there was a link there to like there's a frequently asked questions document that is she's been working on internally and that

1003
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:30,711
[SPEAKER_06]: is going up, Ms.

1004
01:31:30,771 --> 01:31:31,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Vaughn-Jones?

1005
01:31:32,712 --> 01:31:33,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably in the next week.

1006
01:31:33,973 --> 01:31:43,237
[SPEAKER_14]: We're just getting some feedback from other administrators, and then it will be up with all the information and the process that parents and caregivers can follow.

1007
01:31:45,058 --> 01:31:45,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1008
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:48,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1009
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:49,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Wright?

1010
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:55,622
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on mute.

1011
01:31:56,263 --> 01:31:56,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm muted.

1012
01:31:57,302 --> 01:32:01,545
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a mute member, I'm sorry about that.

1013
01:32:02,886 --> 01:32:03,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1014
01:32:03,446 --> 01:32:26,203
[SPEAKER_09]: This doesn't need to go into the resolution, but I think the other thing that I'd love to see as part of this is a conversation with the 504 coordinators, because I have heard from caregivers who are going through this process that they feel like sometimes their coordinator and their team isn't expecting the particular accommodations and they would like the team to be thinking

1015
01:32:28,003 --> 01:32:35,870
[SPEAKER_09]: about other options that maybe they've received doing this work as teachers in other districts, as coordinators in other districts.

1016
01:32:35,910 --> 01:32:53,945
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think as this communication goes out and we may be seeing more people coming to the process, I would love to see a little more conversation among the people who will be interfacing with the families about doing that and doing that in a really accessible, culturally sensitive way.

1017
01:32:54,726 --> 01:33:07,209
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, this isn't picking on anyone in particular, but just to make sure that we really are a strong team in responding to these requests and in really becoming a team in putting them in place.

1018
01:33:10,389 --> 01:33:10,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1019
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:14,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so is there a motion for approval?

1020
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:16,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1021
01:33:19,411 --> 01:33:19,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by.

1022
01:33:22,552 --> 01:33:23,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I can second.

1023
01:33:25,673 --> 01:33:26,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, roll call, please.

1024
01:33:28,315 --> 01:33:28,915
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Bradley.

1025
01:33:29,556 --> 01:33:29,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1026
01:33:30,937 --> 01:33:31,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham.

1027
01:33:31,737 --> 01:33:31,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1028
01:33:33,298 --> 01:33:34,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Ntaba.

1029
01:33:34,999 --> 01:33:35,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1030
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:36,561
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Olapade.

1031
01:33:36,901 --> 01:33:37,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1032
01:33:37,821 --> 01:33:38,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Reinfeld.

1033
01:33:39,162 --> 01:33:39,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1034
01:33:40,163 --> 01:33:41,664
[SPEAKER_17]: Members say yes, Mayor Langenberg.

1035
01:33:43,085 --> 01:33:45,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, seven the affirmative, zero the negative, motion passes.

1036
01:33:46,247 --> 01:33:47,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Ntaba.

1037
01:33:49,237 --> 01:34:17,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Also offered by member in Tapa is 2025-37, be it resolved that the Medford Public Schools will work alongside a register of voters to best identify how we can improve engagement, engaging our student population in the following but not limited to areas, pre-registering to vote, absentee mail-in ballots if traveling, currently stationed elsewhere than mass or at a higher education institution, identify roadblocks and barriers outside the norm of registering, how to address

1038
01:34:19,510 --> 01:34:20,251
[SPEAKER_08]: a letter, et cetera.

1039
01:34:21,231 --> 01:34:31,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Action items will be created to then send to an ad hoc committee created by the superintendent of key stakeholders to best identify ways to strengthen our voter education plan across the district.

1040
01:34:32,017 --> 01:34:32,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Intoppa.

1041
01:34:34,178 --> 01:34:34,818
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mayor.

1042
01:34:35,138 --> 01:34:38,960
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, this comes out of my work personally at my day job.

1043
01:34:39,981 --> 01:34:48,085
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of, for context, during election season and not during election season, I work heavily with our college students at the Master's College of Art and Design

1044
01:34:48,767 --> 01:35:02,919
[SPEAKER_13]: get them educated on on civic and just sort of catch them up to speed alongside the director of government corporate relations and my other team and student engagement to help students figure out a way to make a plan to vote to figure out voting stuff.

1045
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:10,546
[SPEAKER_13]: During the 2024 presidential election I was dealt I was dealing with a lot of shocking

1046
01:35:12,630 --> 01:35:18,635
[SPEAKER_13]: questions, a lot of things that I never would have thought of that our students here were wondering.

1047
01:35:18,735 --> 01:35:27,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Things like, all right, I know who my registrar voter is, but I don't know how to address a letter because my state requires that I send in a letter application if I can't make it in person.

1048
01:35:28,002 --> 01:35:32,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Or, oh yeah, I'm just going to go early vote at the MFA.

1049
01:35:33,046 --> 01:35:33,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Where do you live?

1050
01:35:33,667 --> 01:35:34,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I live in Quincy.

1051
01:35:35,268 --> 01:35:36,169
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not how that works.

1052
01:35:37,029 --> 01:35:40,232
[SPEAKER_13]: And so really helping catch our Medford students up to date

1053
01:35:41,127 --> 01:35:46,612
[SPEAKER_13]: on how these things work, their rights as voters, their rights as, and their ways that they can do it.

1054
01:35:47,293 --> 01:35:58,262
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I want our Medford Public School students to be the leaders that I work with to help educate other students and to get them aware of, you know, how to pre-register, the age they can pre-register.

1055
01:35:59,403 --> 01:36:06,249
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if they live in the dorms, can they register to vote in the dorms or should they, you know, stay at home or should they stay registered at home?

1056
01:36:06,690 --> 01:36:07,010
[SPEAKER_13]: All these

1057
01:36:08,739 --> 01:36:19,685
[SPEAKER_13]: things that they may have questioned, especially for our students who may be shipped off in the military, and how they, sorry, I thought my computer froze for a second, how they have voting rights and all that.

1058
01:36:19,705 --> 01:36:24,708
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is really an ask for the administration to take a look at how we can best support our students.

1059
01:36:24,748 --> 01:36:33,954
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thankful for our faculty members that go to our Register of Voters and pull out Register to Vote cards and help get students pre-registered or registered.

1060
01:36:35,134 --> 01:36:37,696
[SPEAKER_13]: The Medford Register of Voters, I've had a conversation with them

1061
01:36:38,257 --> 01:36:49,245
[SPEAKER_13]: Especially Jim Blanchard, the elections manager, talking about how they would love this support because they would love the support from the schools to help work together collaboratively to make this in.

1062
01:36:51,506 --> 01:37:01,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Easy as you know, the committee could come out and say we have cards to hand out, or it's a bunch of QR codes that get posted outside of every bathroom around election season and whether or not they're eligible or not to do it.

1063
01:37:01,933 --> 01:37:06,997
[SPEAKER_13]: At least the information is there and it's ready, and we're lucky that Massachusetts, the Secretary of the Commonwealth,

1064
01:37:07,941 --> 01:37:20,969
[SPEAKER_13]: has an amazing one-stop shop for all these things, but it's about getting our students there in the first place to learn about it so that they know about it before they need it and to be better civic leaders, not just in Medford, but wherever they may choose to go once they leave here.

1065
01:37:21,629 --> 01:37:22,830
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what this motion is.

1066
01:37:23,991 --> 01:37:31,375
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I said, it could be as simple as there's a sign that's printed really nice that gets put up every year, year round outside the guidance office.

1067
01:37:31,415 --> 01:37:35,437
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be that we send out a yearly notice about voting and registering to vote.

1068
01:37:37,109 --> 01:37:39,311
[SPEAKER_13]: or we put together voting packages, whatever it may be.

1069
01:37:40,192 --> 01:37:41,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, super open-ended.

1070
01:37:41,293 --> 01:37:43,215
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why I'm having the experts talk about it.

1071
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:48,219
[SPEAKER_13]: I've talked to Will about this a few times about what the graphic design looks like or what have you.

1072
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:50,481
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think that's enough of me talking.

1073
01:37:50,501 --> 01:37:53,004
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the motion stands for what it is.

1074
01:37:53,044 --> 01:37:53,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1075
01:37:54,405 --> 01:37:55,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Intoppa.

1076
01:37:55,426 --> 01:37:56,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham, then Member Reinfeld.

1077
01:37:58,133 --> 01:37:58,593
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1078
01:37:58,613 --> 01:38:08,682
[SPEAKER_11]: I was actually wondering if this might be a great place to plug our student advisory council into the conversation.

1079
01:38:08,702 --> 01:38:19,612
[SPEAKER_11]: I think when adults do things, sometimes it works and when peers do things, there's a different lens that is effective.

1080
01:38:20,850 --> 01:38:34,784
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I'm wondering if it might make sense to like, amend the motion to ask the administration to work with the student advisory council to explore solutions that might improve our statistics.

1081
01:38:34,985 --> 01:38:36,126
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think my other.

1082
01:38:37,684 --> 01:38:40,866
[SPEAKER_11]: My other question is like, what are what are the statistics now?

1083
01:38:41,306 --> 01:38:43,568
[SPEAKER_11]: And what are we trying to achieve?

1084
01:38:43,948 --> 01:38:52,814
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't, you probably don't know the answer to that question, but I would be curious if we're going to invest time and energy in this, which is really important.

1085
01:38:52,934 --> 01:38:56,757
[SPEAKER_11]: It would also be nice to be able to say it worked or.

1086
01:38:57,637 --> 01:39:01,180
[SPEAKER_11]: It kind of worked, or this is where we saw movement.

1087
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:09,207
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't know how to frame those kinds of metrics, but I assume the elections manager does and could provide that input to us.

1088
01:39:10,828 --> 01:39:11,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1089
01:39:13,690 --> 01:39:13,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1090
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:14,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Reinfeld?

1091
01:39:15,883 --> 01:39:19,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I really like the idea of bringing in the student council on this.

1092
01:39:19,406 --> 01:39:30,536
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think this feels like something that guidance can lead in the same way that this is, it's information about what happens after high school and in some cases during high school and careers.

1093
01:39:31,157 --> 01:39:40,585
[SPEAKER_09]: The other person that I would recommend potentially bringing in on the city side is Matisse from the Office of Prevention and Outreach.

1094
01:39:40,605 --> 01:39:42,487
[SPEAKER_09]: She's the youth coordinator and

1095
01:39:43,487 --> 01:39:55,511
[SPEAKER_09]: in some of our community liaisons to think about how to make sure this language gets to people in all of the ways that they communicate with families.

1096
01:39:57,232 --> 01:39:57,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1097
01:39:59,293 --> 01:40:03,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ntuk, are you moving approval and seconded by?

1098
01:40:03,114 --> 01:40:06,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I happily accept the amendments.

1099
01:40:07,541 --> 01:40:13,703
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that the reason I left it kind of vague was to assist the superintendent in helping find that and make sure it's availability.

1100
01:40:13,723 --> 01:40:22,386
[SPEAKER_13]: In previous conversations, I brought up specifically the CCSR and this being some kind of civic-led project to help survey the students and figure out where their needs are.

1101
01:40:22,486 --> 01:40:28,267
[SPEAKER_13]: Because like you said, when it's peer-to-peer, it's a whole difference of experience and a whole different outcome in terms of surveys.

1102
01:40:28,948 --> 01:40:35,730
[SPEAKER_13]: So getting the SAC involved, getting the CCSR involved to figure out how we can, like I said, find those weird little

1103
01:40:37,655 --> 01:40:42,236
[SPEAKER_13]: gaps is in what be registering or may not be doing it.

1104
01:40:42,616 --> 01:40:46,657
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all about building this routine early on and anything we can do to help support that.

1105
01:40:47,037 --> 01:40:59,781
[SPEAKER_13]: And also it may not apply to students, but it sure as heck can maybe apply to their families and making sure that they can take that guide and help assist their families when it comes to voting, um, assist their friends and more, um, spread the wealth.

1106
01:40:59,801 --> 01:40:59,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1107
01:41:00,481 --> 01:41:01,501
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

1108
01:41:02,402 --> 01:41:04,122
[SPEAKER_13]: I motion to approve and accept the amendments.
