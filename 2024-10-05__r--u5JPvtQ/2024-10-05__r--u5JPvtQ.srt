1
00:00:02,691 --> 00:00:03,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:03,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh.

3
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:03,991
[SPEAKER_06]: 23448 Committee.

4
00:00:04,012 --> 00:00:07,474
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole meeting met for City Council notice Wednesday, November 29th 2023 at 6 30 P.m.

5
00:00:07,514 --> 00:00:08,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Meeting is called to order.

6
00:00:08,474 --> 00:00:08,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr

7
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:24,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, vice president bears is present.

8
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:25,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in the office next door.

9
00:00:25,907 --> 00:00:27,007
[SPEAKER_07]: He's in the office.

10
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:30,988
[SPEAKER_08]: So I heard him yell present council care of yellow president.

11
00:00:32,228 --> 00:00:38,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Collins present Councilor night Council night is absent Councilor scarpelli present.

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor saying, President, President Morrell present six present one absent.

13
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:57,176
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be a meeting of the Medford City Council committee the whole on Wednesday November 29 2023 at 630pm via zoom only the purpose of this meeting is to discuss the MBTA community zoning ordinance.

14
00:00:57,777 --> 00:01:03,804
[SPEAKER_06]: The committee has invited Alicia hunt director of the Office of planning development sustainability and senior planner Daniel Evans to attend this meeting.

15
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:08,006
[SPEAKER_06]: For their information aids and accommodations contact the city clerk at 781-393-2425.

16
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:12,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Sincerely yours, Nicole Morrell, Council President.

17
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:20,551
[SPEAKER_06]: So as the notice states, this is designed to be sort of an information session for the proposed zoning relative to the MBTK communities.

18
00:01:21,752 --> 00:01:31,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Act so that came before the council at our not this not last night but our previous regular meeting that by procedure and statute we refer to the CD board.

19
00:01:32,304 --> 00:01:37,810
[SPEAKER_06]: It is something that has an end of the year deadline and as was presented by director hunt to us, there's a lot of

20
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,352
[SPEAKER_06]: specifics that came down from the legislature.

21
00:01:40,372 --> 00:01:46,574
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's not a whole lot of wiggle room communities have Medford any community affected by this.

22
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:52,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know we have Emily Ness, a consultant that's helping the city that has a presentation for us.

23
00:01:52,897 --> 00:01:58,759
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to make sure that due to the short timeline, we can have counselors that have questions, concerns, have those addressed.

24
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully folks

25
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,881
[SPEAKER_06]: can join us from the public.

26
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:10,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I know meeting on zoom only and a little bit later, because there's the holiday event that's taking place in the chambers right now, but we are still on deadline for this.

27
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:11,849
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's important that we meet.

28
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:19,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless counselors have questions or statements before we start, we could hand it over to Emily to give us a short presentation.

29
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing none, Emily, I'll let you take it away.

30
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:28,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you very much.

31
00:02:28,193 --> 00:02:30,354
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you counselors for your presence tonight.

32
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:38,017
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that this will be informational for you and set you up for a successful discussion and public hearing next month.

33
00:02:38,698 --> 00:02:46,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to quickly share my screen, but as I do so, I want to let you know that I have worked in Medford before.

34
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:49,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I was part of the team that did your recent comprehensive plan.

35
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:54,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a pleasure to be working with you again on this, on the MBTA Communities Act.

36
00:02:55,256 --> 00:03:11,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Alicia and Danielle and I have been going back and forth, first checking the work that was done earlier this year on the compliance model, and then turning that into draft zoning, as you said, for sending to the CD board and then obviously to yourselves.

37
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:23,740
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know you've received some information about the MBTA Communities Act, so I'm not going to go into great detail on the act itself, what it is, why it is, however you have questions on that.

38
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:26,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to answer those to the best of my ability.

39
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:32,337
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want to focus us on today are the three components that go into compliance.

40
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:37,579
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are land area capacity, meaning unit capacity and zoning.

41
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:48,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to you a little bit about what those are, what we're looking for, and then what Medford's requirements are and the current draft zoning that the CD board will be taking up.

42
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:52,963
[SPEAKER_02]: And then talk to you a little bit about next steps and how people can get questions and comments

43
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,650
[SPEAKER_02]: either Alicia and Danielle to the CD board or to myself.

44
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:02,094
[SPEAKER_02]: So land area, it's a geographic area of the proposed district.

45
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:16,366
[SPEAKER_02]: It includes the location of the district, the size, whether or not it's adjacent to transit, which is critical for you as a rapid transit community, and whether or not there's excluded land, which is land that can't be counted for unit capacity.

46
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:18,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll talk about that a little bit later.

47
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:29,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Capacity is the number of dwelling units that can be potentially, that will be zoned for, which is different from production.

48
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:37,986
[SPEAKER_02]: So we call this unit capacity, and it is a function of the land area and the zoning, how the two of those work together.

49
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:43,168
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's unit count, the density measure of the number of units per acre,

50
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:49,996
[SPEAKER_02]: and also the requirement for adjacency to transit are all components of unit capacity.

51
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:57,420
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally zoning, which is really the rules under which we can build and have uses.

52
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,362
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a function of the land area and the capacity together.

53
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:03,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see that these three things work together.

54
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:11,948
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really important when we're demonstrating compliance because it means that we have to demonstrate compliance across all three of these categories.

55
00:05:12,785 --> 00:05:25,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when we think about zoning, we're thinking about uses, lot sizes, other dimensional standards, such as open space requirements, setbacks, parking, and any density restrictions.

56
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:32,176
[SPEAKER_02]: So Medford's minimum land area requirements, it's a minimum of 35 acres.

57
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:39,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say I haven't yet worked with a community that's gotten close to its minimum because in terms of being that low,

58
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:47,466
[SPEAKER_02]: because the minimum number of acres is very much related to how densely people want to see development happen.

59
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:55,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many communities are thinking about if we have more acres, does that allow us for a lower level of density in some areas?

60
00:05:56,032 --> 00:05:58,534
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot we can talk about in terms of strategy.

61
00:05:59,015 --> 00:06:09,382
[SPEAKER_02]: You are required to have 75% of your MBTA district in a station area, which is consistent with the fact that you have both Orange Line and Green Line stations.

62
00:06:10,426 --> 00:06:15,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And 50% of your total district size must be within that transit area.

63
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:20,191
[SPEAKER_02]: So, or sorry, it must be a single contiguous district, my apologies.

64
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:26,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a strategy that some communities are using if they're thinking about more than one district area.

65
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:29,856
[SPEAKER_02]: In your case, as you'll see, that's not currently applicable.

66
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:37,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the purposes of the zoning that will be coming before the CD board and before yourselves for the public hearing,

67
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,940
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking at the Wellington T Station only.

68
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go through the reasons why.

69
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:47,582
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see Revere Beach Parkway here and the Felsway here.

70
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:51,864
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is the orange line with rough location of the Wellington T Station.

71
00:06:52,664 --> 00:07:00,167
[SPEAKER_02]: These parcels in white are the parcels that are included in this draft zoning district.

72
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:01,348
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll walk through them.

73
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:09,509
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the main reasons for starting with this particular district is that Medford is a rapid transit community.

74
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:19,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the president of the city council mentioned earlier, you have a deadline of December 31st of 2023 to submit your zoning to be in compliance.

75
00:07:19,217 --> 00:07:27,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not a lot of time to look into some of the other areas of the city, many of which are already primarily built out.

76
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:34,551
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of single family, two family, et cetera, residential in some of those areas.

77
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:45,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the types of areas that if you're going to add density and there could be good reasons to do that, but it might require more significant community conversations.

78
00:07:46,318 --> 00:07:53,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as we'll talk about a little bit later, there are good reasons to address housing needs in those parts of the city.

79
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:54,966
[SPEAKER_02]: in a different way.

80
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:58,709
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of the discussion here is you've got a tight timeline.

81
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:14,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Another good reason for this area, and you can see by this orange blob, which is your half mile of the train station radius, is all of the district that we're looking at is within a half mile of this train station.

82
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:20,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that means that you are more than that 75% compliant in terms of locating the district here.

83
00:08:21,306 --> 00:08:23,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes it a good reason to think about this.

84
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:41,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Another reason is that you've got a lot of existing height in this area, which means when you think about putting a, um, perhaps a greater concentration of housing in one area, um, you can see that you've, uh, contrary to other parts of the city, you've got a lot of height here already.

85
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:47,713
[SPEAKER_02]: So these numbers are the building heights on these different parcels and they range from a building height of one.

86
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,643
[SPEAKER_02]: which will be important as we all the way up to a building height of 11, which I counted three times just to make sure I got that right.

87
00:08:56,044 --> 00:09:09,553
[SPEAKER_02]: But so there's significant height in this area and that does mean that should you pass zoning that allows for more height, which this does, that height would comfortably fit into this district and obviously allow for more units.

88
00:09:11,104 --> 00:09:16,088
[SPEAKER_02]: The other part that's interesting about this, and I think it's an interesting strategy.

89
00:09:16,568 --> 00:09:27,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working with a lot of MBTA communities, and each community is thinking about how the MBTA Communities Act can best help them with their own housing needs.

90
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:38,586
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one interesting part of this strategy is, although you do have a lot of development in this area, and it's unlikely that much of this development will change.

91
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:40,788
[SPEAKER_02]: To just jump back a little bit, you're seeing

92
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:45,455
[SPEAKER_02]: multifamily heights of six to eight stories already.

93
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:47,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a hotel in here that's about nine stories.

94
00:09:48,376 --> 00:09:50,977
[SPEAKER_02]: These taller buildings are unlikely to change.

95
00:09:51,037 --> 00:09:58,599
[SPEAKER_02]: They form a nice, in this particular area, they form a nice buffer against the neighborhood of unlikely to change.

96
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:09,903
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you look at some of the lower building heights here or the extent of the parking here or the possibility of change there, what that says is that with the right zoning,

97
00:10:10,473 --> 00:10:13,456
[SPEAKER_02]: these parcels could change to something else.

98
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:17,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Clearly they haven't done so, so far, because there hasn't been a good incentive.

99
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,023
[SPEAKER_02]: This strategy of saying, hey, we need to think about the MBTA Communities Act.

100
00:10:23,504 --> 00:10:37,395
[SPEAKER_02]: How could that help us create better value for parcels in this area to encourage them to meet the zoning or the, sorry, the existing built environment by giving them some additional incentives

101
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:40,913
[SPEAKER_02]: is a very good reason for considering this particular area.

102
00:10:42,354 --> 00:10:49,419
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, this particular area provides one component of an overall housing strategy for the city.

103
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:57,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to circle back to this idea that yes, you have other transit stations, they each have an existing built environment around them.

104
00:10:58,084 --> 00:11:06,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford has housing needs across a range of building types and unit types, across a range of incomes, across a range of

105
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:11,327
[SPEAKER_02]: how people want to be able to live in different housing products.

106
00:11:13,091 --> 00:11:16,237
[SPEAKER_02]: The MBTA Communities Act can address some of that.

107
00:11:16,838 --> 00:11:18,942
[SPEAKER_02]: It can provide for a certain type

108
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:31,582
[SPEAKER_02]: of housing unit, it can provide for sort of workforce to market rate levels of affordability, but it's not a one size fits all strategy.

109
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:46,331
[SPEAKER_02]: You will be looking at doing an overall comprehensive review of your zoning and there's an opportunity within that to do some more of those neighborhood based strategies that would allow you to think of

110
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:48,506
[SPEAKER_02]: the different areas of the city.

111
00:11:48,706 --> 00:11:57,728
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, considering the timeline, the location, the ability to allow some of these parcels to change, this seems like a good strategy.

112
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:00,609
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the geographic area.

113
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:02,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a little bit about the unit capacity.

114
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:09,291
[SPEAKER_02]: So your minimum unit capacity, which is based on the 2020 housing units from the US Census, is 6,443 units.

115
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, 75% of these need to be located in the station area.

116
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:27,686
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think about the other station areas in Medford, yes, you could always choose to spread it across those, but just thinking about what the existing built environment is around there.

117
00:12:28,106 --> 00:12:32,527
[SPEAKER_02]: And you do have a minimum density requirement of 15 dwelling units per acre.

118
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:40,070
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where the unit capacity, the geography, how big or how small the district is, and the zoning start to play a role

119
00:12:41,027 --> 00:12:43,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I mentioned something called excluded land at the beginning.

120
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:50,051
[SPEAKER_02]: And excluded land, which is the land that you see here in green, cannot be modeled for unit capacity.

121
00:12:50,491 --> 00:12:54,813
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see there is some excluded land, including the T-zone property.

122
00:12:55,753 --> 00:13:03,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that when you do that, the density on the remaining parcels does have to be higher to get you to the overall density level.

123
00:13:03,456 --> 00:13:05,557
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see what excluded land is.

124
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:11,716
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also something called sensitive land, which is the blue diagonal hatching that you see here.

125
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:17,040
[SPEAKER_02]: This is land that the state calls out and says, you can model it for unit capacity.

126
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Your community may or may not have rules or regulations around building.

127
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:25,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, floodplains, some of the secondary wellhead protection areas.

128
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:30,610
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just calling out so you can think about whether or not you want to build there.

129
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,652
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, you actually have very little sensitive land

130
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:34,804
[SPEAKER_02]: in this area.

131
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:41,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nicely drawn out by the previous consultant team to really exclude the sensitive land.

132
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And then obviously you do have some excluded land.

133
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:48,708
[SPEAKER_02]: So that factors into your density requirement.

134
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:49,769
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see that in a minute.

135
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:52,129
[SPEAKER_02]: So you more than meet your minimum land area.

136
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:58,031
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually have 136 acres and that's important because you have so much excluded land in there.

137
00:13:58,591 --> 00:14:01,472
[SPEAKER_02]: You more than meet your station location.

138
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:03,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're running two different scenarios now

139
00:14:04,363 --> 00:14:08,805
[SPEAKER_02]: scenario one is the zoning that was presented to the CD board.

140
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:18,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Scenario two, I think one of the members had asked, could we just change a couple of dimensional ratios just to see what it would do.

141
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:24,034
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm showing it to you to show that there are a couple of different ways to be compliant.

142
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:33,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you to what we can and can't change to figure that out in a minute, but you're compliant for both scenario one and scenario two.

143
00:14:34,346 --> 00:14:42,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Your minimum unit capacity is 6472, so you are about as close as you can mathematically get to that minimum unit capacity.

144
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:45,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, 100% of those are in the station area.

145
00:14:45,816 --> 00:14:56,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And your minimum density requirement, because you have so much excluded land, is actually quite high because that land is taken out of the density requirements.

146
00:14:56,244 --> 00:15:00,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So this number of units is actually spread across the smaller

147
00:15:01,181 --> 00:15:04,784
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller land areas that are not in green here.

148
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:13,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I do want to stress that unit capacity, zoned unit capacity is not the same thing as a production target.

149
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:17,374
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, the city does not have to produce these amounts.

150
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:30,105
[SPEAKER_02]: It's understood through the legislation and the zoning that as with any zoning, it is up to the private property owner and the private market to decide whether or not they're going to take advantage of that zoning

151
00:15:30,503 --> 00:15:38,086
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certainly ways of creating incentives to encourage housing production in the areas that you want to produce housing.

152
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:41,567
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, there's some incentives built into the zoning.

153
00:15:41,627 --> 00:15:43,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the final component.

154
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:48,309
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the dimensional standards in the current draft that's in front of the CD board.

155
00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:58,373
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet, a minimum height of two stories, because this was really an area that should have higher buildings to match what's already there.

156
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:06,574
[SPEAKER_02]: a maximum height of five stories, but there is, and that five stories is what is tested in the compliance model.

157
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:09,156
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are compliant at five stories.

158
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:23,503
[SPEAKER_02]: The maximum height with incentives that allows for that increased density with some public benefit incentives that are built into the zoning that goes up to nine stories.

159
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:26,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it's a story per incentive.

160
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:45,844
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a maximum building coverage, so the amount of lot area the building can take up is 80%, and then your minimum parking of 0.8 spaces per unit, which is what is tested in the model, or 0.5 spaces per affordable unit, and a maximum parking of 1.5 spaces per unit.

161
00:16:46,485 --> 00:16:48,206
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the zoning itself.

162
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:54,550
[SPEAKER_02]: These can be changed slightly, but just understand that if they are changed,

163
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:59,158
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to go back and run the compliance model because these are feeding directly into it.

164
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:19,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So just be aware that there are some things that went in zoning when you change them, you can change them, but there are other things that when you change them, it might speak directly to compliance and that these are among those, the minimum lot size, the maximum height, the maximum building coverage and the minimum parking in particular.

165
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:33,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, and I'm happy to go through and talk to you about or answer any questions that you have, but just know for anybody watching that the CD board meeting is next week on the 6th.

166
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:38,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Your public hearing, of course, as you know, is on the 12th and a possible continuation to the 19th.

167
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:44,631
[SPEAKER_02]: If any of you or anybody who's listening has questions, please reach out to Alicia and Danielle.

168
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:46,513
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see their email addresses there.

169
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:49,637
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's anything that I can answer, they'll shoot them over to me.

170
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:51,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, I'm happy to respond.

171
00:17:51,978 --> 00:17:59,661
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have comments, you can either submit them directly to Alicia and Danielle, or even better, attend to the CD board meeting.

172
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:04,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, that applies to all of you, as well as to anybody who might be listening.

173
00:18:04,864 --> 00:18:05,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the overview.

174
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:12,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to go back and answer any questions either on the presentation or if you have other questions about the

175
00:18:13,248 --> 00:18:17,350
[SPEAKER_02]: MBTA Communities Act and the implications, I'm happy to answer as much as I can.

176
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:30,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And Madam President, before we opened up to the councillors, I just wanted to emphasize this one piece, that there is a public hearing that's been advertised on this for the council in a few weeks.

177
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:39,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it would be better if there's not pontification and deliberation tonight, but rather questions, clarifying questions

178
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:52,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody actually would like to see changes or would like to discuss their opinions with me or Danielle or even Emily, we're happy to take that offline outside of a public meeting.

179
00:18:54,046 --> 00:19:00,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you could bring them to the CD board, especially if you wanted to see different things modeled before the council meeting opens.

180
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:02,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to discuss those.

181
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:06,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to be careful that what we're doing tonight isn't in violation of public

182
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:18,136
[SPEAKER_03]: like open meetings so that we're talking about, we're answering questions, we're making sure people understand what's in front of them, and not doing the deliberation that needs to happen at the public hearing on the 12th.

183
00:19:18,176 --> 00:19:20,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

184
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:20,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

185
00:19:20,557 --> 00:19:21,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Director Hunt.

186
00:19:21,237 --> 00:19:22,258
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a helpful reminder.

187
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:25,179
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you, Emily, for that presentation.

188
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:28,581
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will open it up if councillors have any questions.

189
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:33,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Councillor Collins.

190
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:40,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, really appreciate the work of the planning staff that went into this.

191
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:50,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's been a lot of back and forth with the state, so thank you for staying on it for many months to make sure that we can be in compliance and really appreciate the presentation as well.

192
00:19:50,108 --> 00:19:51,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Emily, thank you for being here.

193
00:19:51,549 --> 00:20:00,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I was hoping, could you speak a bit more about the maximum height with incentives piece, how that works, how those triggers kick in?

194
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,453
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not feeling super intuitive to me.

195
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:04,214
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could walk us through that, I'd really appreciate it.

196
00:20:06,184 --> 00:20:07,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, I'm happy to.

197
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:12,110
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, Danielle and Alicia join in as necessary.

198
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just pulling it up on my screen.

199
00:20:13,451 --> 00:20:14,271
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have it in front of me.

200
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:19,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing worse than trying to remember zoning without it in front of you.

201
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:27,844
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a couple of things that, you know, in kicking these ideas around with Alicia and Danielle and the previous work that they'd done.

202
00:20:28,982 --> 00:20:33,664
[SPEAKER_02]: One important thing to remember is that it's multifamily as of right.

203
00:20:33,864 --> 00:20:38,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means you cannot mandate a ground floor commercial use.

204
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:51,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what this zoning does, and this is common in a number of places, is create an incentive of an additional story above the five for a ground floor commercial.

205
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,750
[SPEAKER_02]: You already have that in that area.

206
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense to create that incentive,

207
00:20:58,707 --> 00:21:05,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And it allows for the possibility of a district that is mixed use in terms of verticality.

208
00:21:05,936 --> 00:21:14,826
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, you have the ground floor commercial and multifamily above and next door to it could be a full multifamily building with no ground floor commercial.

209
00:21:15,336 --> 00:21:19,900
[SPEAKER_02]: but this incentive creates the opportunity to get that ground floor commercial.

210
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:24,584
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of others in there that are more community benefits.

211
00:21:24,924 --> 00:21:42,660
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is an additional story allowed if a minimum of 50% of the ground floor provides rents at less than market rate, less than 15% below market rate for a minimum tenancy of three years to help fill those commercial spaces.

212
00:21:43,712 --> 00:21:52,114
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the reasons the state did not allow for a mandated ground floor use is that in some communities, filling that commercial space has been really difficult.

213
00:21:52,174 --> 00:22:01,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of getting that active walkable area, you are getting a vacant space on the ground and residential above, and none of us want that.

214
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:07,718
[SPEAKER_02]: So that additional story allows for a tenant to come in at a reduced price.

215
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's qualified tenants.

216
00:22:13,148 --> 00:22:15,709
[SPEAKER_02]: qualified non-residential tenants going in there.

217
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:29,592
[SPEAKER_02]: So nonprofits, local businesses under 10 employees, the idea is that it provides an incentive to fill it, but also an incentive to fill it with local or nonprofit generating that traffic.

218
00:22:30,472 --> 00:22:35,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are some additional stories for affordability requirements.

219
00:22:35,713 --> 00:22:41,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned earlier that really the MBTA Communities Act is not a solution for deep affordability.

220
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:49,604
[SPEAKER_02]: 80% AMI for 10% of units at 80% AMI.

221
00:22:50,764 --> 00:22:54,346
[SPEAKER_02]: For many communities, that's not quite enough for what they're looking for.

222
00:22:54,466 --> 00:23:04,909
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a structure, an incentive structure here to allow for either more units or a deeper affordability and or a combination of the two.

223
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,551
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also certification for a net zero emissions building.

224
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:12,352
[SPEAKER_02]: So consistent with Medford's commitment to

225
00:23:13,294 --> 00:23:23,043
[SPEAKER_02]: energy efficiency and sustainability, and a bonus for a development certified as LEED Gold or LEED Platinum or the equivalent.

226
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:37,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the idea is by allowing that differential between the five stories and the nine stories, there's a menu that a developer could pick and choose from that really speaks to community benefits that have been important to Medford.

227
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:41,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

228
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:42,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that cover your questions, Councillor Collins?

229
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It does.

230
00:23:43,591 --> 00:23:44,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

231
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:47,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from Councillors?

232
00:23:49,214 --> 00:23:49,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Behrs.

233
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:52,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

234
00:23:54,417 --> 00:24:03,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Emily, just so I can clarify this as well, this is an overlay, so the existing zoning still exists in the area.

235
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing the nod is correct.

236
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:20,146
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we, Alicia, if I'm misremembering this, please let me know, but we passed a PDD for the property on Mystic Valley Parkway, or was it just a zoning change?

237
00:24:20,947 --> 00:24:24,568
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a zoning change for that parcel to be in the Muzz zone.

238
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:26,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Muzz zone, right, okay, got it.

239
00:24:27,149 --> 00:24:30,191
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yeah, so I was just noting that some of the properties that you noted

240
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,901
[SPEAKER_07]: as more likely to see change.

241
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:37,843
[SPEAKER_07]: We've actually already seen potential proposals or requests for zoning changes on them.

242
00:24:37,903 --> 00:24:38,844
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is an overlay.

243
00:24:38,904 --> 00:24:40,685
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't change it or affect those.

244
00:24:41,205 --> 00:24:42,306
[SPEAKER_07]: It just allows, yeah.

245
00:24:42,526 --> 00:24:42,887
[SPEAKER_07]: So cool.

246
00:24:42,927 --> 00:24:43,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

247
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:43,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

248
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:45,148
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

249
00:24:46,249 --> 00:24:46,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

250
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:48,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from councilors?

251
00:24:52,253 --> 00:24:54,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have one or two questions.

252
00:24:54,415 --> 00:24:57,399
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm talking about the excluded land.

253
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:01,243
[SPEAKER_06]: So the excluded land is about specifically about the station area.

254
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:13,756
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the city at large, because I know I think of like the fells, we have like a lot of excluded land, but it's just the area, the land within the station area, or the zoning area that's been chosen.

255
00:25:14,998 --> 00:25:16,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm glad you asked that question.

256
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:22,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Excluded land is a layer that was created by the state, both the excluded land and the sensitive land.

257
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:32,524
[SPEAKER_02]: And they calculated it or prepared the GIS shape files for all 177 cities and towns for the entire area of the town.

258
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:40,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea is that any place that a town or a city might choose to test, you would be able to calculate the excluded land.

259
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,628
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, the fells would be included.

260
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:48,042
[SPEAKER_02]: any of the parcels that meet the criteria that I had up, I'm happy to put them up again if needed.

261
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Those would be shown on the maps.

262
00:25:53,443 --> 00:25:56,704
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a map of all of Medford's excluded land.

263
00:25:57,604 --> 00:26:03,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it comes into play is in the parcel by parcel calculations of unit capacity.

264
00:26:03,945 --> 00:26:08,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, that excluded land is removed from those calculations.

265
00:26:10,812 --> 00:26:14,595
[SPEAKER_02]: the ability to build is being calculated on the rest of that parcel.

266
00:26:15,035 --> 00:26:21,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It also feeds into the overall calculation of density of the dwelling units per acre.

267
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:35,510
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you were to move the area somewhere else, then I would have to do a calculation of the excluded land that's removed based on that geographic area as opposed to this one.

268
00:26:36,246 --> 00:26:51,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing I want to sort of clarify, because it's funny, is that the excluded area is technically only in the MAF, but it is still in the zoning overlay, because the MBTA station itself is of particular interest to Medford.

269
00:26:51,880 --> 00:27:03,710
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's not calculated in our MAF, but this overlay does in fact apply there, so that if in fact we're doing the air rights project,

270
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:07,791
[SPEAKER_03]: this zoning would be in play at that location.

271
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:13,313
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not that it's excluded from the zoning, it's only excluded from the math.

272
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?

273
00:27:14,314 --> 00:27:18,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not, yeah, so it's not necessarily excluded in that nothing can ever be built there.

274
00:27:19,315 --> 00:27:19,956
[SPEAKER_06]: It's excluded.

275
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:20,336
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

276
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:27,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there somewhere that we can see, because excluded, this is like a term that was defined within the act.

277
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:29,419
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like a previously used term, correct?

278
00:27:30,404 --> 00:27:30,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

279
00:27:30,904 --> 00:27:32,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the compliance guidelines.

280
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:35,126
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a definition of compliance guidelines.

281
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:43,451
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you drill down into the section on how to run the compliance model, it's further defined and explained there.

282
00:27:44,391 --> 00:27:46,032
[SPEAKER_02]: And Alicia is absolutely right.

283
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:49,474
[SPEAKER_02]: The model and the zoning differ on certain aspects.

284
00:27:49,574 --> 00:27:54,116
[SPEAKER_02]: So the model is there to calculate the unit capacity and the density.

285
00:27:55,666 --> 00:28:15,396
[SPEAKER_02]: as Alicia said, the zoning applies to the whole, so should the ownership of a parcel change at some point, or for example, your transfer of development rights or the air rights change such that that parcel could be developed, it's not going to affect the unit capacity calculations for compliance, but it will be subject to the zoning.

286
00:28:16,416 --> 00:28:17,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

287
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:18,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Danielle, did you have something you wanted to add?

288
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:22,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you need to be unmuted?

289
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:23,900
Okay.

290
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:30,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

291
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:31,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

292
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:31,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

293
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Danielle Evans, senior planner.

294
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:33,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

295
00:28:33,866 --> 00:28:50,349
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we were and to go back to the excluded land issue, when we're evaluating the other potential station areas, we were bumping up against a lot of excluded land over there, too, especially around the new Green Line station is surrounded by land owned by Tufts.

296
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:52,149
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's excluded land.

297
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:56,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just all these other areas like this.

298
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,230
[SPEAKER_04]: It was.

299
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:03,617
[SPEAKER_04]: all of these different metrics kind of pushing us in.

300
00:29:03,677 --> 00:29:03,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

301
00:29:04,017 --> 00:29:09,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's really helpful to know because I think there's been some chatter on Wellington being kind of a neglected part of the city.

302
00:29:09,939 --> 00:29:11,800
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, here's a big change.

303
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,581
[SPEAKER_06]: They just chose Wellington because no one cares about Wellington.

304
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:18,422
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's helpful information.

305
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:25,650
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just one quick question for maybe ends up being longer just Alicia and Danielle and then I'll make sure to go to other counselors.

306
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:38,744
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one thing that's been said as this has been presented to kind of help assuage just that this is a big change is that this of course this is a zoning change this does not mandate, the building of any of these units.

307
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:48,508
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, we make this zoning change then it is open, you know, it's open for anyone to present a development and because it is on this way.

308
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:51,170
[SPEAKER_06]: There is little space for.

309
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:58,974
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to say refusal but I mean people can develop these things, stuff by right that's that's how it's designed right so I just want to.

310
00:29:59,614 --> 00:30:10,171
[SPEAKER_06]: make clear on that because I think we go we say this is just zoning it doesn't mean units but in a place like Medford and this is how it's designed because we're zoning there's very likely development to follow.

311
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:18,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and that's actually why we asked Emily to share that image and we can share it again and share slides if that's helpful.

312
00:30:20,425 --> 00:30:37,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the parcels that we think are either really, really gonna change, like the one that we just rezoned, that is extremely likely that that is going to have a new housing development on it, whether or not we do the zoning in the near future.

313
00:30:39,336 --> 00:30:57,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are ones that are just pretty likely right like from that to like, it makes sense we haven't talked to the owners but but there's space it would make sense there, why we're showing which ones are likely and which are kind of not likely nobody's gonna knock down station landing to take advantage of this that's just not happening.

314
00:30:59,266 --> 00:31:04,268
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to show that and both sorry there was something else in there I just wanted to.

315
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,942
[SPEAKER_03]: touch on was the likelihood of this happening.

316
00:31:12,262 --> 00:31:13,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize if I think of it.

317
00:31:14,082 --> 00:31:16,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll come back to it.

318
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:17,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

319
00:31:17,863 --> 00:31:18,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

320
00:31:19,884 --> 00:31:22,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Go to Councilor Carvillo.

321
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:23,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Madam President.

322
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:30,045
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking at the presentation, so the maximum amount of permits would be like 6,500 in that area.

323
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Just under, yes, that's correct, that unit capacity.

324
00:31:40,576 --> 00:31:45,300
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and that includes even the part where we have the air rights, or is that all included in there in that same?

325
00:31:47,061 --> 00:31:49,223
[SPEAKER_02]: That land is all included within there, yes.

326
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:50,044
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

327
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:51,265
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my understanding.

328
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:54,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

329
00:31:55,449 --> 00:32:01,874
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, I think Alicia and Danielle read my mind on a lot of the questions that I was gonna ask.

330
00:32:03,664 --> 00:32:20,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the outstanding question I think for for folks at home, that would be great for maybe for for your team to help answer what would be how this plan aligns with our comprehensive plan.

331
00:32:21,772 --> 00:32:22,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I think.

332
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:25,294
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, that's it's something that we worked so hard on.

333
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:29,215
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we we worked with Ines associates on it.

334
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,917
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think this is there's there's definitely an answer to this.

335
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:36,839
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think folks at home would appreciate hearing more about it.

336
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:45,902
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know, Alicia, if you wanted to jump in first on that, if you wanted me.

337
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:51,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Wellington was one of the areas that was looked at in particular in the comprehensive plan.

338
00:32:52,438 --> 00:33:02,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, too, when we were starting to talk about that bonus strategy, that very much aligns with many of the goals in the plan.

339
00:33:02,905 --> 00:33:08,769
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we could certainly bring that link out more clearly to people.

340
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:10,210
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that question.

341
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all for your work, by the way, and thank you for answering questions.

342
00:33:17,882 --> 00:33:33,890
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I'm sure at previous council meetings, we've had a few more specific questions, but I know Alicia said that you prefer us to leave this for public education, so.

343
00:33:36,632 --> 00:33:39,753
[SPEAKER_03]: We're happy to get into the questions that you guys have.

344
00:33:41,964 --> 00:33:51,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I want people to either know enough or feel like they're going to have enough information that when you get the CD board recommendations that you can vote on this.

345
00:33:52,888 --> 00:34:00,571
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't feel that everybody wanted, I got the impression from the counselors you didn't want to take an hour and a half at a city council meeting if we could do some of this prep.

346
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:02,933
[SPEAKER_03]: This will also give you a good chance to sleep on it.

347
00:34:03,353 --> 00:34:07,476
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have the opportunity to watch the CD board meeting on the six.

348
00:34:07,617 --> 00:34:14,162
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll also, I think could could give you information help you get a more robust understanding of what the counts with their thinking.

349
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:20,376
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to answer Councillor Scarpelli's question in absentia.

350
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:42,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have reached out to a number of the property owners and developers who either own land in this area or have been thinking about developing in this area and sent them this draft and told them about the CD board public hearings and the council public hearings.

351
00:34:42,802 --> 00:34:46,524
[SPEAKER_03]: and told them that we are inviting their public comments, they're welcome to send that to me.

352
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:54,464
[SPEAKER_03]: through me to the boards and council, and that we would share that with everybody.

353
00:34:55,244 --> 00:35:08,171
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they have any questions on it, I'm still working on getting, basically we've sent it to all of those who we have had some interaction with over the past number of years, so that I had their contact information.

354
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:15,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually am asking one of our graduate students to look at the properties whom we don't have

355
00:35:16,095 --> 00:35:21,940
[SPEAKER_03]: contacts for if he can figure out their information so that we can send it to them.

356
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,522
[SPEAKER_03]: This is public, feel free to send it to anybody.

357
00:35:25,562 --> 00:35:32,207
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know developers or whatever for any reason, we want this to be something they can use.

358
00:35:32,267 --> 00:35:36,230
[SPEAKER_03]: We want them to build some housing.

359
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:40,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Please get their feedback, help us get their feedback.

360
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:41,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate that.

361
00:35:41,654 --> 00:35:42,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for that.

362
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're here, sorry.

363
00:35:44,431 --> 00:35:45,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mean to speak for you.

364
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:47,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize you were here.

365
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:58,940
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm listening and I appreciate that, you know, understanding this with clarity and making sure like we talked about, making sure that the information is out there.

366
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,663
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this meeting is perfect because it is the information that will help us guide us for our next meeting.

367
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:05,244
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

368
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:08,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you both.

369
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:10,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions from councilors?

370
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:13,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have one more question.

371
00:36:14,447 --> 00:36:18,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Director Hunt, I know you've explained this to us before, but just help me.

372
00:36:18,252 --> 00:36:28,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I promise I'm not being obtuse, but I know when we talk about the number of units in an area like Wellington, some of those units already exist, or what is that?

373
00:36:28,445 --> 00:36:30,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Like some of those units are already factored into the calculation.

374
00:36:30,908 --> 00:36:31,729
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you explain that again?

375
00:36:34,343 --> 00:36:51,154
[SPEAKER_03]: COB, Bethany Collins — she-her-hers, she-her-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-hers, she-h

376
00:36:51,414 --> 00:36:58,537
[SPEAKER_03]: the number of units that could be built with given this parking ratio, the number of stories, the setbacks required.

377
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:05,060
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what could be built as of right, which reminded me of the other point I was going to make, which is site plan review.

378
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:17,665
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not what we actually think will and could be built because we don't we believe that nobody's going to knock down, for example, like I said, station landing.

379
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:25,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so that 6,400 is if all of these parcels were clear and free, that's the number that could get built.

380
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:26,715
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

381
00:37:26,895 --> 00:37:28,836
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll add on that through the president.

382
00:37:30,357 --> 00:37:41,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we've looked at this, but I would bet that some of those parcels actually have more units there already than what the zoning would yield.

383
00:37:41,983 --> 00:37:46,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't play into what is there at all.

384
00:37:47,857 --> 00:37:55,023
[SPEAKER_04]: zoning could conceivably yield because I think some of those developments were built by use variances or they've been there for so long.

385
00:37:55,043 --> 00:37:59,727
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure how some of them got to be there in the existing zoning.

386
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:10,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually what I thought we should clarify is that this zoning would allow buildings of a certain size to be built as of right if they meet these parameters.

387
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:16,758
[SPEAKER_03]: But any buildings of these size in Medford would still need to go through site plan review.

388
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:33,206
[SPEAKER_03]: So there would still be a review by the planning board to look at their site layout, the look and feel of the buildings, the accessibility around it, the transportation, the plantings, the green space, all of that.

389
00:38:33,706 --> 00:38:42,290
[SPEAKER_03]: would still be reviewed and shaped by the Community Development Board, but the board could not tell them, no, you're not allowed to build the building.

390
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:46,472
[SPEAKER_03]: They could only say, here's how we would like you to improve this building.

391
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:52,035
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to be clear, they could build it as of right, but we would still have some say in the matter.

392
00:38:53,076 --> 00:38:53,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

393
00:38:53,636 --> 00:38:54,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's really helpful.

394
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:58,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what I was circling on without the words to ask it, so I appreciate that.

395
00:38:59,199 --> 00:38:59,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Behrs.

396
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:07,117
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe just said a slightly different way, many of these units already exist, right?

397
00:39:07,198 --> 00:39:16,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that, you know, essentially of that 6,500, I don't know what the number is, and you guys may have calculated, I would bet there's probably a couple, 3,000, maybe even more than that already in that zone.

398
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:22,472
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, I think that's just a helpful clarification.

399
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:32,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I think that's, you know, my interpret or I received part of that is like, this is what happens when you write an act for such very different communities.

400
00:39:33,057 --> 00:39:37,822
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're already Yeah, we're already pretty built up in many spaces.

401
00:39:37,922 --> 00:39:41,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So any further questions from counselors?

402
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:47,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Or any members of the public who have questions or would like to speak?

403
00:39:52,642 --> 00:40:02,631
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, seeing none, Alicia, Emily, Danielle, is there anything final you'd like to say as we're here tonight, knowing we're of course going to meet on this a few more times?

404
00:40:04,953 --> 00:40:10,858
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to add that back to Councilor Sang's question about like how this aligns with the comprehensive plan and

405
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:29,366
[SPEAKER_04]: The act, the MBTA law doesn't actually, but the way that we've crafted the zoning to fit Medford with these incentives, so that we can meet our affordability goals, which the MBTA law doesn't address.

406
00:40:29,767 --> 00:40:32,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're actually doing an economic feasibility study

407
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:39,733
[SPEAKER_04]: so that we can even use our existing inclusionary zoning, but that won't be finalized.

408
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:46,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I just saw an email from MAPC who's doing it that it's delayed and we won't get that till the third week of December.

409
00:40:46,617 --> 00:40:51,240
[SPEAKER_04]: But hopefully it will come out that we can use our existing inclusionary zoning.

410
00:40:52,901 --> 00:41:02,987
[SPEAKER_04]: But also the incentives are for our climate sustainability goals and economic development and having these be walkable, vibrant areas.

411
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,232
[SPEAKER_04]: in addition to creating much needed housing.

412
00:41:09,574 --> 00:41:09,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

413
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:22,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to add that when you all go and think sleep on this, if other questions come up, you want other things clarified, I'd actually strongly encourage you don't wait for that city council meeting on the 12th.

414
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:29,853
[SPEAKER_03]: We would rather hear them and address them individually in advance so that by the time you're walking in there,

415
00:41:32,102 --> 00:41:35,263
[SPEAKER_03]: you really have the information you need to make decisions.

416
00:41:36,003 --> 00:41:37,624
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to rush the council.

417
00:41:37,764 --> 00:41:41,285
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other hand, the state has really, they do.

418
00:41:42,865 --> 00:41:49,167
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're trying to do is make sure you have the opportunities to get these questions answered in advance.

419
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:54,689
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want us to then say, present certain things, you ask me a question, you want the public to hear it,

420
00:41:54,989 --> 00:41:59,411
[SPEAKER_03]: so you want me to repeat the answer at the city council meeting, that's fine.

421
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:06,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I just would hate for us to walk in, you have a bunch of questions, and then we have to go do research to get you answers.

422
00:42:07,073 --> 00:42:08,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to avoid that situation if I can.

423
00:42:11,015 --> 00:42:11,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, appreciate it.

424
00:42:11,815 --> 00:42:12,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Farris.

425
00:42:13,936 --> 00:42:20,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, and not to belabor the point, but Danielle, if you could just explain a little more why do we have to get

426
00:42:20,993 --> 00:42:25,477
[SPEAKER_07]: the existing inclusionary zoning reassessed for viability.

427
00:42:25,537 --> 00:42:28,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a condition specifically of the MVTA Communities Act?

428
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:30,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

429
00:42:30,502 --> 00:42:39,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually, when I first saw the guidelines that came out, I instantly was emailing our

430
00:42:40,902 --> 00:42:44,583
[SPEAKER_04]: our state delegation saying, this is nuts.

431
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:48,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe we can't have inclusionary zoning at all.

432
00:42:48,723 --> 00:42:50,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at first it was, you can't do it.

433
00:42:50,624 --> 00:42:51,244
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't have it.

434
00:42:51,844 --> 00:43:01,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it was like, okay, if you already had it, then you can, but only, and then it was like, you had to really justify it.

435
00:43:02,386 --> 00:43:03,946
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally they said, okay, 80% AMI, 10%,

436
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:08,701
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do that.

437
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:11,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, they agreed, yes, everyone can do that.

438
00:43:11,443 --> 00:43:13,424
[SPEAKER_04]: But they agreed that this is the floor.

439
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:18,647
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to do more, you have to have an economic feasibility analysis.

440
00:43:18,707 --> 00:43:26,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So despite the fact that our inclusionary zoning is stronger than what is allowed, we're not grandfathered in.

441
00:43:26,492 --> 00:43:27,753
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't keep it.

442
00:43:28,013 --> 00:43:32,115
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to prove that this isn't hindering housing production.

443
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:36,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And at first, my naive self of,

444
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:44,686
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand this, but then realizing that apparently there's communities that create like really.

445
00:43:45,827 --> 00:43:48,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

446
00:43:48,449 --> 00:43:48,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

447
00:43:48,769 --> 00:43:51,411
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and basically, they're doing it in bad faith.

448
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:52,032
Right.

449
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:56,456
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not to create affordable housing, it's to not have any housing get built.

450
00:43:57,016 --> 00:43:58,077
[SPEAKER_04]: So, right.

451
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:06,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's a law for all 177 communities, and we're all very different and coming at it from different angles.

452
00:44:06,804 --> 00:44:10,486
[SPEAKER_04]: But because of some bad actors, it has to be this way.

453
00:44:11,306 --> 00:44:11,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

454
00:44:11,726 --> 00:44:13,387
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and that I understand.

455
00:44:13,407 --> 00:44:14,127
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard of that.

456
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:20,431
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard of communities using inclusion areas as a barrier to construction.

457
00:44:21,791 --> 00:44:25,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, there's some political benefits there, maybe in different areas.

458
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:38,459
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it's just, I'm interested to see, I'm interested, I think, as we go through the process in this broader sense of looking at the zoning and aligning with the comprehensive plan, obviously inclusionary is gonna be important.

459
00:44:39,439 --> 00:44:45,204
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm kind of interested to see what the economic feasibility analysis says, not so much for this purpose, but for that purpose.

460
00:44:45,405 --> 00:44:49,648
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, but thanks for answering the question.

461
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

462
00:44:53,992 --> 00:44:56,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further questions or do I have a motion?

463
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:06,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing no further questions, do I have a motion to receive and place on file?

464
00:45:06,432 --> 00:45:08,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

465
00:45:09,995 --> 00:45:14,097
