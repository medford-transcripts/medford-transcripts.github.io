23

[SPEAKER_03]: requesting the appropriation of $100,000 from the CPA Historic Reserve to the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability slash Civic Auditorium and Convention Center Commission for the facade restoration of the Chevalier Theater.

24
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,051
[SPEAKER_03]: The project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund by category Historic Reserve.

25
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:17,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Enclosed, please find a copy of the project summary.

26
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your consideration.

27
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:21,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Respectfully submitted, Brenna Lambert-Hearn.

28
00:02:21,594 --> 00:02:26,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have the full enclosure, but I do see Roberta Cameron here.

29
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,117
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilors okay with that, we get to get an overview from Ms.

30
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:32,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Cameron, unless Councilors would like the full enclosure to be read.

31
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,923
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, based upon the review of the paperwork, I see no issue or problem with this, and I would certainly move for approval.

32
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:46,829
[SPEAKER_13]: We all know that the CPA application is a lengthy process that's properly vetted by at least nine members of our community that serve on various boards and commissions.

33
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:55,356
[SPEAKER_13]: We've all spoken in favor of how much we support the Chevalier Auditorium and how much we want to see this auditorium be the economic driver in our square.

34
00:02:55,873 --> 00:03:03,697
[SPEAKER_13]: I think facade improvements is something that we've all spoke about in the past I think this is something that I support wholeheartedly and I'm sure that my colleagues do as well, and I'll certainly move for approval.

35
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:05,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

36
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:13,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a motion from Councilor Knights to approve second by Councilor Kelly, as you do a word of Cameron here if you could just give us a brief overview of the paper.

37
00:03:14,042 --> 00:03:15,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you is the mic on.

38
00:03:15,723 --> 00:03:16,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

39
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:23,227
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so Roberta North Street, and I am chair of the community preservation committee.

40
00:03:23,818 --> 00:03:31,304
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm here to speak about the off-cycle application that we received for the Chevalier Theater restoration.

41
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:44,435
[SPEAKER_15]: This was brought to us in order to close a funding gap as they had received funding from other sources, but the cost of the project has escalated so that that's not sufficient to be able to complete the project.

42
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:52,381
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is a very urgent project because the damage is ongoing right now and might threaten the safety of patrons entering the theater.

43
00:03:52,949 --> 00:04:01,371
[SPEAKER_15]: So for that reason, the Community Preservation Committee voted to recommend funding for this project.

44
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:03,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

45
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:04,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions from the council?

46
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:11,433
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Sarpelli to approve the paper.

47
00:04:13,313 --> 00:04:15,874

48
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:16,474

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,881
[SPEAKER_06]: President Morell.

60
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:28,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

61
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:31,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Senator Nazarian I guess the motion passes.

62
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:50,716
[SPEAKER_03]: 22-338 April 20, 2022 to the honorable president members of Medford city council regarding the retiree cost of living adjustment increase your president Morell and members of the city council on March 31st, 2022, the Medford retirement board voted with the unanimous vote of five to zero in favor of informing the city council

63
00:04:51,256 --> 00:05:02,904
[SPEAKER_03]: of the board's intention of increasing the maximum amount of earnings subject to the COLA cost of living adjustment from $16,000 to $18,000 effective July 1, 2022, subject to the approval of the City Council.

64
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:11,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Increasing the maximum amount of earnings subject to COLA from $16,000 to $18,000 will increase the maximum COLA per eligible retiree from $480 a year, $40 a month,

65
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:15,714
[SPEAKER_03]: to $540 a year.

66
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:22,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, there are 618 retirees and 450 have a retirement allowance greater than $18,000.

67
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:30,146
[SPEAKER_03]: The remaining 160 retirees have an annual retirement allowance below $18,000 and will not be affected by the increase.

68
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:34,069
[SPEAKER_03]: In aggregate, the COLA cost will increase approximately $2,250 a month

69
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:37,670
[SPEAKER_03]: 27,000 a year.

70
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:43,512
[SPEAKER_03]: The cost associated with the increase will be funded from the pension fund and will not affect the city's fiscal year 2023 budget.

71
00:05:43,932 --> 00:05:50,234
[SPEAKER_03]: The cost of the city will be included in the next actuarial evaluation currently scheduled for January 1st, 2024.

72
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:55,395
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have any questions, Chairman Rick Jordan and I will be in attendance for the April 26th meeting.

73
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:58,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely, Mark Minervini, Executive Director.

74
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:00,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

75
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:12,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President is a member of this fund I am very grateful that the board has moved in its divine wisdom to make this cost of living adjustment applicable to more members in our system.

76
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:18,043
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, when we think about these individuals that are receiving these benefits, these are the people that are the ones that made our city great.

77
00:06:18,063 --> 00:06:24,425
[SPEAKER_13]: These are the ones that worked for 30 plus years dedicating their lives to public service so the metric could be the city that it is or once was.

78
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:31,367
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, I thank the retirement board for their efforts I think Mr. Jordan and Mr. Minerva especially, and I will move approval of the paper.

79
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:35,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Any discussion from the Council?

80
00:06:36,445 --> 00:06:38,265

00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:42,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Karygiannis.

82
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:42,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Karygiannis.

83
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:43,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Karygiannis.

84
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:44,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Karygiannis.

85
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:59,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, President Morell, naming City Councilors.

86
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:00,153
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rick Jordan.

87
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:02,155
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the Chairman of the Metro Retirement Board.

88
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:04,036
[SPEAKER_05]: With me is Mark Minervini.

89
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:08,878
[SPEAKER_05]: He is the Executive Director of the Retirement System.

90
00:07:09,859 --> 00:07:16,463
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to request, through you, an increase in our base, our COLA base it's called.

91
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:29,695
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit of history, I'll use the year of 2021, because I have those numbers already prepared.

92
00:07:29,755 --> 00:07:34,860
[SPEAKER_05]: But for that year, we netted a 17.3 increase in our returns.

93
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:44,926
[SPEAKER_05]: we went up to $259.5 million in value.

94
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:47,787
[SPEAKER_05]: In the past nine years, our retirement board has grown nearly 33%.

95
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:52,449
[SPEAKER_05]: It's over $9 million in the last nine years.

96
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:54,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Year to date,

97
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:20,781
[SPEAKER_05]: figures, we've been positioned, it's been a down market for the first five months of this year, first four months of this year.

98
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:27,405
[SPEAKER_05]: The S&P is down 10% sometime between yesterday and today.

99
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:41,755
[SPEAKER_05]: Our returns are down minus 3.8% because of the way we are positioned, conservatively positioned, and we've done very, very well for the members of our retirement board.

100
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:54,615
[SPEAKER_05]: If you, I understand this is very complicated stuff, retirement stuff, but what we're looking for is an increase for our members from $16,000 a year.

101
00:08:54,655 --> 00:08:59,076
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the base that we present our cost of living increase on, 16,000.

102
00:08:59,117 --> 00:08:59,737
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanna go to 18,000.

103
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:14,067
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a very, very large amount for us to absorb, but it's something that we feel is required based on inflation, especially within the last six, eight months.

104
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:16,869
[SPEAKER_05]: And with your help, we can do it.

105
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:20,452
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you've got any questions, see what we can do for you.

106
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:21,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.

107
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:25,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor, I don't know if your hand is up again.

108
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:29,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I'm just wondering if you could give us a breakdown as to what our unfunded pension liability is.

109
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:40,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, so the percentage is what our percentages of the even if that makes it easier.

110
00:09:40,606 --> 00:09:54,575
[SPEAKER_13]: We're at 64% funded 64% funded and do I know we were we were on a, we were at a great clip to comply with the directives to, you know, make ourselves so sustainable and fully funded.

111
00:09:55,175 --> 00:09:59,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we still on track or has the second recession set us back a little bit in that regard.

112
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:01,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we're still on track.

113
00:10:02,158 --> 00:10:05,020
[SPEAKER_14]: We had some very strong returns last year.

114
00:10:06,602 --> 00:10:10,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Just as Rick mentioned, 17.3% return net of fees.

115
00:10:11,686 --> 00:10:15,749
[SPEAKER_14]: That netted us just a little under 40 million in investment.

116
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:20,432
[SPEAKER_14]: So right now we're on target to be fully funded by 2033.

117
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:21,873
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's the deadline that they gave us?

118
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:21,873
2040.

119
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,915
[SPEAKER_13]: 2040.

120
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:23,915
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're seven years ahead of schedule.

121
00:10:31,392 --> 00:10:31,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

122
00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:32,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent job.

123
00:10:32,953 --> 00:10:33,453
[SPEAKER_13]: Excellent work.

124
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:34,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

125
00:10:35,574 --> 00:10:44,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just want to thank you too I think this is a difficult position.

126
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:47,679
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know when there's ever a question.

127
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,161
[SPEAKER_04]: You're always there to help so we appreciate all your hard work.

128
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:52,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

129
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:57,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion from the council.

130
00:10:58,712 --> 00:11:01,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe we had an original motion.

131
00:11:01,074 --> 00:11:03,076

00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:31,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President.

147
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,980
[SPEAKER_05]: On behalf of our members, we thank you very, very much.

148
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good evening.

149
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:35,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you too.

150
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

151
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to take paper 22-336 under suspension.

152
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:40,801
[SPEAKER_11]: So moved.

153
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:42,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

154
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

155
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we take it because we're still on it.

156
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:59,139
[SPEAKER_06]: You can still take it though, now that I got the roll call.

157
00:11:59,199 --> 00:11:59,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

158
00:11:59,540 --> 00:11:59,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

159
00:11:59,860 --> 00:11:59,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

160
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

161
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:00,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

162
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:00,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

163
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:01,602
Yes.

164
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:01,782
Yes.

165
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:34,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, 70 in front of you and then I get the motion passes to to dash 336 April 22 2022 for Rebecca Amani culture have seven Rebecca, thank you for your interest in serving on a border commission with the city of Medford.

166
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:36,799
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pleased to appoint you to the term to a term

167
00:12:37,415 --> 00:12:45,045
[SPEAKER_03]: To the Medford Board of Election Commissioners, which expires on March 30th, 2026, please take the enclosed appointment letter to the office of the city clerk to be sworn in at your earliest convenience.

168
00:12:45,586 --> 00:12:48,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your continued commitment and dedication to the city of Medford.

169
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:56,793
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll read the other paper I read in reverse order, because they have the same number.

170
00:12:57,633 --> 00:13:04,034
[SPEAKER_03]: April 22nd, 2022, the Honorable President and members of the Metro City Council, regarding the Board of Elections Commission appointment.

171
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:17,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear President Morell and members of the Metro City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable body confirm the appointment of Rebecca Amami, a Democrat of 12th shift at apartment seven to the Election Commission for a term to expire March 30th, 2026.

172
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,478
[SPEAKER_03]: A copy of the appointment letter is attached.

173
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

174
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:22,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely, Brenna Oliver Park.

175
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:45,579
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have this before us tonight to fill out the last spot on the election commission, and the council was presented a letter I believe that you can stop not be here tonight so the council just sent a letter so what they said last week, as far as why their faith in appointments there and I know Rebecca is unable to be here tonight as well.

176
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:49,459
[SPEAKER_13]: No, just refer to a committee of the whole Madam President to interview the applicant.

177
00:13:54,143 --> 00:13:57,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, she's probably a wonderful person.

178
00:13:57,084 --> 00:14:02,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, if I didn't see a resume or have anyone talking on behalf, I don't know who she is.

179
00:14:02,126 --> 00:14:17,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I can, I don't know if we go to committee of the whole, but just to get her information, if there's any way that maybe for next week, if we can, you know, just table to next week.

180
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:22,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just to, I'd like to get the background if we can.

181
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:25,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.

182
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:28,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we do have, Director Beresford, we do have Sandy Gale here.

183
00:14:28,424 --> 00:14:33,507
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, I was gonna say if we could maybe hear from Sandy Gale, but, you know, I didn't know Mr. Nardella.

184
00:14:34,848 --> 00:14:40,991
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't, you know, I... At least, I'm saying at least there was a resume, you know, there was... Was there?

185
00:14:41,211 --> 00:14:42,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, at least I saw it.

186
00:14:43,293 --> 00:14:44,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'd be happy to hear from you.

187
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:45,674
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, if that's the case.

188
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:47,195
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted some information.

189
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:50,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam Mayor, Sandra Gale, election coordinator.

190
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:56,462
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot speak for the administration and I won't.

191
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:12,426
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I can tell you that the candidate has been fully vetted and I'm sure that when she applied to be on the commission, one of the requirements is to produce some sort of CV or resume or something.

192
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:17,788
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been told by one of the other commissioners who was approved last week

193
00:15:18,253 --> 00:15:20,675
[SPEAKER_00]: that she does have community involvement.

194
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:38,648
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would ask that the council move forward to confirm this candidate so that we can get our commissioners in place and we can continue to move forward with what we're doing with the elections department.

195
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:41,030
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been fully vetted.

196
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:44,232
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was done by me.

197
00:15:44,252 --> 00:15:47,875
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have

198
00:15:49,347 --> 00:15:50,668
[SPEAKER_03]: do you want to keep your motion.

199
00:15:51,468 --> 00:15:57,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Well my motion would be to have a committee of the whole to meet with the applicant to see who they are I appreciate the work that Sandy's done.

200
00:15:58,172 --> 00:16:06,857
[SPEAKER_13]: I glad that the administration finally stopped sitting on their hands after the primary election of last year to come around and start appointing people to these boards.

201
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:10,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, we're in a position now we're up against a wall.

202
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:11,299
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

203
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:12,940
[SPEAKER_13]: We're up against a wall.

204
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:23,985
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have anybody that can even approve nomination papers for candidates that are running for state office right now in our community, because since September of 2021, the administration hasn't acted on vacancies that are in the registrar's office.

205
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:33,510
[SPEAKER_13]: So much so that this council had moved to change the format of our elections office to establish an election commission from a board of registrars of voters.

206
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,452
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's very frustrating to be put in this position.

207
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:46,405
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember when I sat in that chair next to me a long ago when I had this was almost a quote that she'd say you know how can you give us something today and expect us to vote on it with no information.

208
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:52,528
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate what Sandy's done in the office and I also appreciate what she has to say but this candidate has not fully been vetted.

209
00:16:53,188 --> 00:17:03,274
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason this candidate has not been fully vetted is because it requires Council approval, and the Council hasn't approved this candidate, and that is the vetting process that is the check and balance that we have for right.

210
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:06,876
[SPEAKER_13]: That is the advice and consent process that's established

211
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:09,571
[SPEAKER_13]: when we establish one of these elections commissions.

212
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:19,378
[SPEAKER_13]: So my theory and my feeling would be that each one of these individuals should be put through a committee of the whole process, where we get to interview them, ask them some questions, talk to them and feel comfortable with them.

213
00:17:20,299 --> 00:17:27,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Because ultimately, we want someone that's going to be impartial, someone that's not going to bring politics into the game, someone that's going to act in the best interest of this community and not as an activist.

214
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:30,726
[SPEAKER_13]: And those are things that you really can't find out unless you talk to somebody.

215
00:17:31,407 --> 00:17:32,468
[SPEAKER_13]: So those are my concerns with this.

216
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:36,811
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's why I call for a committee of the whole, I'd let my motion rest on the table and hope a colleague would second it.

217
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:41,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Madam President, if I may.

218
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:52,741
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the nomination papers that we had been holding in queue were certified as of Thursday of last week.

219
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:59,243
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent out an email notifying and thanking everyone for their collaboration in that effort.

220
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:07,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, we are not behind the eight ball on anything that we're moving forward on.

221
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:14,188
[SPEAKER_00]: the administration has been open to, this is what we need and this is how we need to get it.

222
00:18:15,588 --> 00:18:21,009
[SPEAKER_13]: So in that point, if there's no hurry, then let's have the committee of the whole, it sounds good to me, I like it.

223
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:25,350
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not behind the eight ball and we're in a good spot, then let's vet this properly.

224
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:36,152
[SPEAKER_03]: I do just want to note that last week there were three, there was actually 4% of the council, three were already voted through, so just noting for the process when you weren't here.

225
00:18:36,977 --> 00:18:37,237
[SPEAKER_03]: others?

226
00:18:37,497 --> 00:18:38,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, yes, I was not.

227
00:18:38,398 --> 00:18:39,378
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a child care issue.

228
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:41,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, was not able to make the meeting.

229
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:41,979
[SPEAKER_13]: You're correct.

230
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the last part.

231
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:50,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Not to say that the motion would have been the same had I been there.

232
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:57,244
[SPEAKER_13]: It just, uh, the motion's gone and seconded so we can move on.

233
00:18:58,084 --> 00:18:58,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a second?

234
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:03,166
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no second for council next motion.

235
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:14,452
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think what I was saying before it was kind of, it's just, I, it's either we know an applicant or we would read their resumes.

236
00:19:14,812 --> 00:19:15,693
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have an idea.

237
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:30,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I don't need a committee the whole meeting I think that if you read someone's resume I get to see who they were what what their background was I think that would be enough for me so to me to table this until we get just the resume this week to vote on it next week.

238
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:34,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it will hold us up that much, but I just think that.

239
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:42,900
[SPEAKER_04]: It, to me, that's, you know, we've gone through, like last week, we voted, like I said, I knew a few when I saw our resumes.

240
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:52,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So to me, that gave me enough confidence with the, you know, the background check that was done by our city administration.

241
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:55,550
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be my motion.

242
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

243
00:19:56,731 --> 00:20:02,015
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a motion on the table to table this from Councilor Scarpelli, and that is not debatable.

244
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:03,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see Councilor Collins.

245
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:11,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, President Morell.

246
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:18,158
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to note, in general, I actually really do agree with points raised recently by

247
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:28,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Knight, I think that in general, you know, if something comes before us for approval, it shouldn't be a rubber stamp, it should be a reasoned and intentional decision.

248
00:20:29,157 --> 00:20:38,786
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, in this specific case, because we didn't hold a Committee of the Whole for the three applicants that were approved last week, I don't know that it would be fair in this case to hold a Committee of the Whole for Ms.

249
00:20:39,026 --> 00:20:39,367
[SPEAKER_01]: Imani.

250
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:46,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I would support the motion to table this for only one week to take it back up again in a regular meeting next week.

251
00:20:47,652 --> 00:20:53,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to maintain the consistency, keep things moving along because that's what our newly minted election commission needs.

252
00:20:53,915 --> 00:21:01,579
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the future, I would support having more intentional process for approving commissioners for anybody.

253
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

254
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:07,623
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to table the paper for one week.

255
00:21:07,663 --> 00:21:08,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information.

256
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:22,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any particular information that we'd like to request from the administration prior to us tabling this paper so that they're aware that there's something in particular that we're looking for whether it's just a resume a CV letter of support from the mayor, or whatnot.

257
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:31,295
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, do we want the applicant to attend the meeting, or would a resume suffice do we want the applicant to attend with a resume.

258
00:21:32,656 --> 00:21:33,877
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, we've done in the past.

259
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:40,385
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done in the past is we've seen, like I said, giving you example, Mr. Miller and I've known him.

260
00:21:40,825 --> 00:21:45,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, I know his background, and I'm confident with what I know.

261
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:48,995
[SPEAKER_04]: I also, I, other, other, other.

262
00:21:52,237 --> 00:21:55,198
[SPEAKER_04]: other participants resumes that to me, that's fine.

263
00:21:55,598 --> 00:22:06,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just the resume, plus the added vetting of Sandy and her staff and the administration, I think that all I just wanna see is what their background is.

264
00:22:06,923 --> 00:22:09,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that to me, that's all I need.

265
00:22:09,684 --> 00:22:13,005
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all I would ask for if someone wants to add to that, you're more than welcome.

266
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:21,989
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, I think a simple, their resume just to get a better idea of what we think personally, I think it's important.

267
00:22:22,578 --> 00:22:29,492
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd just like to add a copy of the application as well then Madam President.

268
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:31,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, my president.

269
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:41,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Just, I would certainly support creating a more thorough system for how we approve appointments from the administration.

270
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,944
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wouldn't feel comfortable treating this applicant differently than we've treated the applicants in the last week.

271
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:52,226
[SPEAKER_11]: So just having a committee of the whole, I think that would mean we did three at once and then one separately.

272
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:55,048
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that's no longer on the table, but I just wanted to put that out there.

273
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:56,609
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we have to treat everyone the same.

274
00:22:56,629 --> 00:22:59,431
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm fine with tabling for one week.

275
00:23:00,731 --> 00:23:01,472
[SPEAKER_11]: So I won't debate that.

276
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:10,645
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight to table for one week and get a copy of the resume and application from the administration.

277
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:16,389

[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, thank you very much.

325
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:39,569
[SPEAKER_13]: Charles Shannon was a mentor of mine.

326
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:43,932
[SPEAKER_13]: I had the opportunity to work for him from 1999 until his untimely passing.

327
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:50,818
[SPEAKER_13]: He was a United States Army veteran, a retired police officer, and a Massachusetts state senator.

328
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:58,324
[SPEAKER_13]: He had over 50 years of government service to this Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the United States of America, and also the city of Medford.

329
00:25:58,584 --> 00:26:03,528
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are many things that Charlie did in his tenure as the

330
00:26:04,052 --> 00:26:15,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Massachusetts State Senator representing Medford, such as supporting marriage equality, supporting universal health care, supporting the extension of the Green Line, which we're now seeing 17 years after his passing finally come to fruition.

331
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:18,883
[SPEAKER_13]: These are many of the items that Charlie worked on that he helped put in motion.

332
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:26,909
[SPEAKER_13]: Not only that, he was one of the most prolific constituent service senators in the state legislature during his tenure there.

333
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:29,471
[SPEAKER_13]: He was someone that never left anybody behind.

334
00:26:29,491 --> 00:26:33,494
[SPEAKER_13]: I had the opportunity to work for him with Councilor Caraviello's son for a summer.

335
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:38,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Council marks former Council marks was a staff member and Senator Shannon's office as well.

336
00:26:39,354 --> 00:26:49,458
[SPEAKER_13]: He was just a great mentor to many people and a great friend to many, but also he was a great representative for this community in Medford in the state legislature he always delivered for us when it was time to deliver.

337
00:26:50,018 --> 00:27:00,722
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you go down to Shannon Beach in Winchester Medford line, you'll see that that was renamed in his honor, recognizing some of the achievements that he's done in the town of Winchester where he

338
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:09,472
[SPEAKER_13]: But Charlie was a great friend he passed away 17 years ago and I hope it's important that everybody recognizes the work that he's done and that we keep his memory alive.

339
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:11,253
[SPEAKER_13]: As we continue to go on.

340
00:27:11,853 --> 00:27:17,036
[SPEAKER_13]: People have always said that someone has always done a better, better than we have before us and Senator Shannon was one of those people.

341
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:24,981
[SPEAKER_13]: I hold myself with great pride, having the opportunity to work with them in great humility, having the ability to recognize that I could ever fill his shoes.

342
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:28,743
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support me in this measure and

343
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:34,109
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, dedicating this meeting to him and having a moment of silence, uh, to recognize all the work that he did on behalf of our community.

344
00:27:34,129 --> 00:27:39,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, he passed away of a very public battle with cancer, uh, over three terms as a state Senator.

345
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,491
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, the Senator battled cancer.

346
00:27:41,591 --> 00:27:47,313
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember going to his, uh, hospital room at the Dana Faba, bringing him the.

347
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:56,516
[SPEAKER_13]: State Senate calendar and, uh, working with him while he was in isolation because he was having, um, bone marrow transplants while he was still going to work every day.

348
00:27:56,937 --> 00:27:58,298
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's just the type of person he was.

349
00:27:58,338 --> 00:28:00,539
[SPEAKER_13]: He was very dedicated to this community and to his job.

350
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:05,963
[SPEAKER_13]: He did his best to never miss a vote while he sat there and battled his illness.

351
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:15,209
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's something that was really amazing to watch, to see how much he loved serving the public and how much he loved fighting for those that were in need.

352
00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:18,311
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's something that we should all really aspire to.

353
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:20,873
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, I asked my council colleagues to support the matter.

354
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:23,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor.

355
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:23,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

356
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:24,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

357
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:29,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to echo Councilor Knight's comments on late Senator Shannon.

358
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:34,666
[SPEAKER_08]: He was both my Senator, but he was a good friend to me and my family.

359
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:43,030
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think some of the values that I sit here with come from things I learned from Charlie Shannon over the years.

360
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:46,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, like I said, don't leave anybody behind.

361
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:49,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I first met Senator Shannon

362
00:28:50,386 --> 00:28:58,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Long before I was in politics, I was the president of the Method Rocky League, and the DCI was condemning the La Conte rink.

363
00:28:59,578 --> 00:29:03,283
[SPEAKER_08]: And going to the state house and going around, no one would help me.

364
00:29:04,444 --> 00:29:06,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Senator Shannon, I think, was just recently elected.

365
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:07,028
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to him.

366
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:13,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Within a few days, he found a half a million dollars to repair the rink and keep it open.

367
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:15,949
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the reason his picture's in that building.

368
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:21,092
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the reason we have a rink still in the city of Medford, because thanks to Senator Shannon.

369
00:29:21,112 --> 00:29:23,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, been a good friend to me and my family.

370
00:29:24,653 --> 00:29:30,036
[SPEAKER_08]: And like I said, he was a good man and he was taken too soon from us.

371
00:29:30,076 --> 00:29:30,236
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

372
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:31,837

401
00:31:28,649 --> 00:31:30,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, thank you, President Morell.

402
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:34,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, this is a pretty self explanatory motion.

403
00:31:34,873 --> 00:31:41,277
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Ramadan is a month of joy for a lot of for our Muslim community here in Medford.

404
00:31:41,797 --> 00:31:50,502
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a month where Muslims reflect on their lives where they celebrate values of service, community service, giving compassion.

405
00:31:50,963 --> 00:31:51,683
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a holiday.

406
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:51,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

407
00:31:53,224 --> 00:32:05,052
[SPEAKER_10]: that's most known for its fasting, but this is something that I think Muslim members of our community take as a moment of joy in their year.

408
00:32:05,553 --> 00:32:10,716
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, because there are so many Muslim members of our community, I found this appropriate.

409
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:16,100
[SPEAKER_10]: And given, you know, what might be decades long,

410
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:20,683
[SPEAKER_10]: discrimination and a feeling that they're not seen in our community.

411
00:32:20,703 --> 00:32:24,585
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this resolution is offered in the spirit of diversity.

412
00:32:24,685 --> 00:32:31,089
[SPEAKER_10]: It's motions like this make people feel more welcome and feel more like a part of our community.

413
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:33,090
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm asking for the council support.

427
00:33:18,902 --> 00:33:38,794
[SPEAKER_03]: 21-402, which requested the immediate outfitting of the Alden Chambers, City Hall Rooms 201 and 207, and one conference room at the Metric High School with fully up-to-date technology using ARPA funds as quickly as possible to allow broadcasting and permanent virtual remote participation for use by the City Council, School Committee, all City Boards and Commissions, and the City Administration.

428
00:33:38,854 --> 00:33:39,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Bears.

429
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:40,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam President.

430
00:33:40,976 --> 00:33:43,497
[SPEAKER_11]: First off, thank you for reading my run-on sentence.

431
00:33:46,238 --> 00:33:47,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was a long one.

432
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,105
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't quite realize how long that sentence got.

433
00:33:53,046 --> 00:33:55,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Kevin, it looks like you have a presentation or a box of some kind.

434
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,431
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm really excited about that.

435
00:33:57,451 --> 00:34:00,555
[SPEAKER_11]: I brought props just in case.

436
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:04,540
[SPEAKER_11]: On the first piece, I have heard that that has been addressed, which is great.

437
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,432
[SPEAKER_11]: But it definitely interested in the props.

438
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:12,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Second one I think this resolution was filed when Patrick was still here so it may not have come to you.

439
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:20,088
[SPEAKER_11]: So certainly not trying to put you on the spot by any means, but we had this council had requested I had

440
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:36,560
[SPEAKER_11]: put forward a resolution last year requesting that this room, the Room 207 Council Office, Room 201 Richley Room, and the conference room at the high school get a kind of a tech upgrade using ARPA funds to make sure that we can have some solid video conferencing.

441
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,301
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's just what that's referencing.

442
00:34:38,341 --> 00:34:39,362
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm excited to hear from you.

443
00:34:39,562 --> 00:34:39,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

444
00:34:42,003 --> 00:34:43,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll say my name and address for record.

445
00:34:43,944 --> 00:34:50,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Kevin Harrington here at my capacity as the MCM station manager, 489 Winthrop Street, Bedford, Massachusetts.

446
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:54,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll cut to the chase that you already addressed, Councilor Bears.

447
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,810
[SPEAKER_09]: The issue has been resolved.

448
00:34:57,751 --> 00:35:06,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Thankfully, I do wanna quickly just mention to all of our residents and members who are Comcast customers that wanna offer our apologies for the inconvenience.

449
00:35:07,555 --> 00:35:10,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, in this case, a lot of this was in Comcast hands.

450
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:15,859
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could have taken a wrench to something and unplugged and replugged things, I certainly would have.

451
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:18,580
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was just beyond that kind of scope.

452
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,743
[SPEAKER_09]: We did do some basic troubleshooting on our end, but essentially came down to Comcast

453
00:35:26,728 --> 00:35:32,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a very long bulleted list of the full timeline that I don't think you necessarily need to get into.

454
00:35:33,316 --> 00:35:40,685
[SPEAKER_09]: But suffice to say, I talked to a tech from Comcast today who informed me that if we have a similar outage like we had,

455
00:35:41,426 --> 00:35:50,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I can contact him directly, whether by phone or by email, and we don't have to necessarily go through a ticketing process that could elongate an outage of this type.

456
00:35:51,194 --> 00:35:54,336
[SPEAKER_09]: So fingers crossed, we don't have to deal with this again.

457
00:35:54,877 --> 00:36:00,681
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we do, we have somebody at our fingertips that can help move this along more expediently.

458
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:04,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

459
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:07,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm constantly bears brought up about room to one or two or seven.

460
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:11,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that was something that Council Falco championed some years back.

461
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:18,696
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not mistaken that those rooms already have there they should already have cameras in both of those room already.

462
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:26,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I know there was a technology package I don't know if we ever kept up with the dues, or the, you know, to keep them up there but

463
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:34,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember, you know, those rooms were, those were live rooms in the past, let's say, and that was something that Councilor Falco championed during his days here.

464
00:36:35,421 --> 00:36:37,982
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, so I can go through those rooms one by one.

465
00:36:38,002 --> 00:36:44,483
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll start with 207, because that's the room I've spent the most time with and kind of been able to make the most progress with.

466
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:48,884
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I looked at 207, there is some equipment in there.

467
00:36:48,904 --> 00:36:54,266
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a video camera, and there was a large board or microphone.

468
00:36:55,146 --> 00:37:01,347
[SPEAKER_09]: But the way it was set up, it essentially had to be managed through a desktop computer.

469
00:37:01,827 --> 00:37:04,088
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't have easily been able to connect to

470
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:14,334
[SPEAKER_09]: any meeting that a commission was doing, they would have had to log into that computer, hook that computer up to the monitor, and it would have been a little bit of a clunky process.

471
00:37:15,574 --> 00:37:21,198
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I was able to do at 207 is I was able to purchase some equipment.

472
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:22,719
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the props component of it.

473
00:37:24,199 --> 00:37:27,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I essentially have a Jabra 810 speakerphone, which I'll grab briefly.

474
00:37:30,003 --> 00:37:33,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because, and I only bring the props not to distract from

475
00:37:34,943 --> 00:37:42,345
[SPEAKER_09]: the substance, but because when you throw out Jabra 8, 10, Logitech X, Y, Z, it's just a bunch of words until you see it.

476
00:37:42,405 --> 00:37:52,086
[SPEAKER_09]: So this I'd use in my capacity at Boston University Medical Campus when we had classrooms about the size of 207 and in fact, sometimes bigger.

477
00:37:53,207 --> 00:37:58,447
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a microphone and speaker phone that connects by USB as well as Bluetooth.

478
00:37:58,507 --> 00:38:00,708
[SPEAKER_09]: But for this purpose, you'd probably want to use USB.

479
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:07,690
[SPEAKER_09]: And the advantage of it is you can plunk this in the middle of a conference table and everyone sitting around the table can be heard.

480
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:10,631
[SPEAKER_09]: And you could hear the Zoom audio coming out.

481
00:38:11,111 --> 00:38:24,936
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the likely use case of whatever commission is in 207, you would have whoever's leading it, whoever's hosting the Zoom meeting, they come in with their laptop, they hook up the HDMI to the monitor that's already in there.

482
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:29,778
[SPEAKER_09]: And they would hook up to this device as well as a webcam, which we're going to have perched in the corner.

483
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:32,332
[SPEAKER_09]: where the old camera currently is right now.

484
00:38:32,832 --> 00:38:37,133
[SPEAKER_09]: So people would have almost a security camera as view of the entire room.

485
00:38:37,694 --> 00:38:47,417
[SPEAKER_09]: And then this microphone would be doing the heavy lifting of catching everyone's voices in the room, being able to emit the voices that are coming through the Zoom.

486
00:38:48,677 --> 00:39:03,665
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason why we went with that I talked to the mayor and the chief of staff, where we wanted to get something rolling we, you know, we didn't want to, you know, go through the process of, you know, trying to get a proposal or something like that that might kind of elongate things.

487
00:39:04,186 --> 00:39:09,649
[SPEAKER_09]: So in this case, you know, we'd use the solution in my previous jobs for similar situations.

488
00:39:10,349 --> 00:39:12,370
[SPEAKER_09]: So the equipment's here.

489
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,811
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't been able to fully install it just yet.

490
00:39:14,891 --> 00:39:20,553
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something I'm hoping to do between now and next Tuesday's meeting, run a couple of tests.

491
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:29,056
[SPEAKER_09]: And the idea would be anyone with a laptop and USB connection would be able to be in there and run a meeting.

492
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:37,059
[SPEAKER_09]: We could also look into if we want to have a dedicated laptop that lives in there that people could sign into, that could be an option.

493
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:39,660
[SPEAKER_09]: We just don't have that equipment purchased as yet.

494
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:51,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Will it be something that will have a history of?

495
00:39:52,253 --> 00:39:57,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, so if it's individuals using their own personal laptops to run the meetings, it would not be.

496
00:39:57,994 --> 00:40:00,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Because all of this gear is essentially just peripherals.

497
00:40:00,615 --> 00:40:03,596
[SPEAKER_09]: It's essentially just outside equipment.

498
00:40:04,896 --> 00:40:12,238
[SPEAKER_09]: So if one person from Zoning Board of Appeals, for instance, used their laptop that they use for ZBA meetings,

499
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:18,960
[SPEAKER_09]: None of that material would necessarily be present when someone from the retirement board comes in.

500
00:40:20,061 --> 00:40:23,062
[SPEAKER_09]: If you use a shared laptop, that would probably be the case.

501
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:29,085
[SPEAKER_09]: If you use a shared laptop and any of that Zoom information that's stored locally would be there.

502
00:40:29,605 --> 00:40:35,588
[SPEAKER_09]: However, depending upon what you're talking about with Zoom, some of the chats are stored in the cloud, that kind of thing.

503
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:37,028
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not always saved in the device.

504
00:40:37,588 --> 00:40:41,090
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a Zoom account level kind of adjustment you can make.

505
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:53,026
[SPEAKER_04]: So for minutes archive isn't that important, don't you think, is there a way that we can that could be capable of all these meetings that our public should be stored and as part of record correct.

506
00:40:53,426 --> 00:40:56,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I believe that if there's, I know that there's.

507
00:40:57,525 --> 00:41:08,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Several meetings, if it's run, I think it depends on who's running the meeting, but I know that there's a lot of accounts that are under the city of Medford's Zoom account.

508
00:41:08,748 --> 00:41:18,010
[SPEAKER_09]: They have like an enterprise level account and we've been able to access recordings and that kind of thing for multiple different types of meetings.

509
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:24,431
[SPEAKER_09]: So as long as those are under that umbrella, those would still be accessible by the cloud.

510
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:26,772
[SPEAKER_09]: The recordings would be accessible and those kinds of things.

511
00:41:29,193 --> 00:41:44,118
[SPEAKER_04]: can I make sure that I'll record that with that information that we have this administration just get back to us to make sure we do have that information that that's part of our mission going forward with the new technology.

512
00:41:44,158 --> 00:41:45,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's very important.

513
00:41:46,383 --> 00:41:56,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something that people get back to us to say, I'd like to see the minutes of the meeting or rerun of the meeting for individual purposes.

514
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:59,856
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can, that'd be something I'd like the administration to follow up with, please.

515
00:42:02,017 --> 00:42:05,318
[SPEAKER_03]: the amendment.

516
00:42:05,378 --> 00:42:11,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to piggyback off that, whereas council meetings, school committee meetings always has, you know, a Medford community.

517
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Are those archived anywhere else other than on the actual website automatically?

518
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:23,764
[SPEAKER_09]: So automatically, if it's recorded through Zoom, it'll be stored as a cloud recording.

519
00:42:24,344 --> 00:42:26,344
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's not recorded through Zoom, it will not be.

520
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:31,446
[SPEAKER_03]: But as there's Medford community media in all of our meetings, school committee, those are always recorded through Zoom.

521
00:42:32,674 --> 00:42:33,596
[SPEAKER_09]: They typically are.

522
00:42:33,776 --> 00:42:35,239
[SPEAKER_09]: They typically are recorded through Zoom.

523
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,546
[SPEAKER_09]: That's usually determined by who is running the meeting.

524
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:41,613
[SPEAKER_09]: We advise anyone who is broadcasting their meeting

525
00:42:42,175 --> 00:42:47,597
[SPEAKER_09]: either live or recording it to be broadcast later to record through Zoom always.

526
00:42:47,877 --> 00:43:03,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Recording through Zoom for any of these public meetings is a good backup for multiple reasons, but we are also making sure that we have our version of all these meetings that go on to, whether it's the website or that are broadcast on MCM, we have those stored.

527
00:43:03,724 --> 00:43:08,066
[SPEAKER_09]: We have multiple ways of archiving those so that we have those going forward.

528
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,127
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are on a city server as well?

529
00:43:10,947 --> 00:43:13,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, I don't, on our end, I don't believe it's a city server.

530
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:28,779
[SPEAKER_09]: We have, we have our, we have, if it's been uploaded to our platform and it's been broadcast through MCM, it lives both on our, we have, you know, a built-in storage server with our CASIS platform.

531
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:40,167
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also, we're currently are expanding our network accessible storage to have even more storage space to also have backup recordings, the backup versions of those meetings.

532
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

533
00:43:44,961 --> 00:43:46,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, thank you very much.

534
00:43:47,003 --> 00:43:48,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Harrington thank you for being here.

535
00:43:48,904 --> 00:43:58,490
[SPEAKER_13]: I do believe when you were given your presentation I heard you say that you spoke with the mayor and the chief of staff and they suggested that they wanted to do this outside of the bid process is that correct.

536
00:43:59,731 --> 00:44:02,913
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember if they we use those terms specifically, it was more.

537
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:13,895
[SPEAKER_09]: The impression that I got is they were fine with getting something like this that we could put together ourselves, just so we could get meetings in there going.

538
00:44:14,295 --> 00:44:28,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, so that would, so what's the, I guess the question is, I mean, anything needs to, any contractor, but I think it's 10 to any, any pervading some services over $10,000, I believe would require it to go out to public bid.

539
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:31,606
[SPEAKER_13]: So it sounds to me like we're getting this done for far less than $10,000.

540
00:44:33,392 --> 00:44:35,453
[SPEAKER_09]: That's in 207's case, yes.

541
00:44:35,513 --> 00:44:43,418
[SPEAKER_09]: For some of these other situations, I don't know that that would be the case, but in 207's case, yes, this was under $10,000, that's correct.

542
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:46,519
[SPEAKER_13]: And where did the funding come from?

543
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:56,345
[SPEAKER_09]: In this case, because I was not aware of any other methodology I was supposed to use, this came out of the MCM equipment budget.

544
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so you took it out of your operating funds that have already been appropriated?

545
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:01,187
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

546
00:45:01,608 --> 00:45:02,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, excellent.

547
00:45:02,668 --> 00:45:08,575
[SPEAKER_13]: And moving forward for room 207, I mean for room 201 and for the console chambers, what price tag do you think would be attached to that?

548
00:45:10,712 --> 00:45:11,973
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a good question.

549
00:45:12,694 --> 00:45:14,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I can briefly touch on 201.

550
00:45:14,896 --> 00:45:22,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been in contact with, forgive me, I don't remember her department, but Teresa DuPont also had some ideas for 201.

551
00:45:24,405 --> 00:45:25,446
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll touch on it briefly.

552
00:45:26,928 --> 00:45:30,171
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a device that I've used in the past as well called a meeting owl.

553
00:45:30,691 --> 00:45:33,454
[SPEAKER_09]: And the hook of that is it's a 360 degree camera.

554
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:38,987
[SPEAKER_09]: and a wireless microphone and speakerphone built in.

555
00:45:39,509 --> 00:45:41,755
[SPEAKER_09]: So instead of plugging in two devices, you only plug in one.

556
00:45:43,477 --> 00:45:46,499
[SPEAKER_09]: and essentially was looking into maybe trying that out.

557
00:45:47,379 --> 00:45:54,123
[SPEAKER_09]: I was amenable to basically trying these two methodologies out, one in 207, one in 201, see how they both work.

558
00:45:54,443 --> 00:46:00,126
[SPEAKER_09]: If people are finding they prefer one over the other, I'm perfectly flexible to make those adjustments.

559
00:46:01,247 --> 00:46:03,468
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of, we haven't purchased any equipment on that yet.

560
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:09,011
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna be in continued contact with Teresa Dupont if she wants to continue to collaborate it.

561
00:46:09,653 --> 00:46:16,359
[SPEAKER_13]: with me on you tell me, I'm not familiar with who Teresa the point is that you development sustainability, I believe.

562
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:17,781
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

563
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:19,142
[SPEAKER_09]: She was on is the IT department.

564
00:46:19,262 --> 00:46:20,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you say it community development.

565
00:46:22,485 --> 00:46:24,067
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in the planning department, I believe.

566
00:46:25,348 --> 00:46:29,432
[SPEAKER_13]: We must be more like an IT when this won't be more of an IT function than community development.

567
00:46:30,977 --> 00:46:34,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so my understanding is she was involved in an email.

568
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:37,180
[SPEAKER_09]: She was added to an email thread because she had the suggestion.

569
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I was looped into the email thread.

570
00:46:40,941 --> 00:46:51,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe based on the email, I don't have it in front of me at the moment, but she has an AV background from previous, in a previous life, as far as I can understand.

571
00:46:51,850 --> 00:47:01,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and I found the device itself that she, uh, references one ideas before we used it, uh, at BU med for during our accrediting, uh, process.

572
00:47:02,314 --> 00:47:06,495
[SPEAKER_09]: In order for a group full of accreditors to talk to people on remote sites.

573
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:11,937
[SPEAKER_09]: So it, you know, it's something that, you know, this is, this isn't something I'd never heard of before.

574
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,198
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Oh, no, no, I'm not saying it is.

575
00:47:14,218 --> 00:47:20,280
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just a little confused as to why we're paying somebody in the planning department to do an it department job or a job that you can do.

576
00:47:21,022 --> 00:47:22,782
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's a whole different ball away.

577
00:47:22,802 --> 00:47:23,382
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all different.

578
00:47:23,402 --> 00:47:26,043
[SPEAKER_13]: That's an administrative issue that has nothing to do with you or the work that you're doing.

579
00:47:26,963 --> 00:47:29,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, you say these things and I just go, huh, I don't know what that means.

580
00:47:29,944 --> 00:47:32,124
[SPEAKER_13]: I just know that if you're going to make it work, it'll work, right?

581
00:47:32,824 --> 00:47:37,885
[SPEAKER_13]: But it seems like based upon these methodologies, the way that they're going to work is it's really going to be user driven interface, right?

582
00:47:37,925 --> 00:47:41,546
[SPEAKER_13]: So the chairman of the meeting, it's only going to be as successful as the chairperson of the meeting.

583
00:47:43,146 --> 00:47:49,887
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would suggest then that the administration implement some type of mandatory training process for the chairs of

584
00:47:50,722 --> 00:47:55,085
[SPEAKER_13]: their boards and commissions that are going to be responsible for this, so that they can do it without a hitch.

585
00:47:55,725 --> 00:48:01,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultimately, if you have you know 20 somewhat boards and commissions and this responsibility is going to fall on the chair of each.

586
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:14,358
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that some training module on methodology should be put in place so that everybody comes in with the same sense of comfort and understanding as to how this works, so that the public isn't the one that's the side that suffers.

587
00:48:15,919 --> 00:48:17,200
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, 100% agree.

588
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:32,069
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, once we get some of the testing going and get things properly hooked up, I absolutely, in my previous employment as well, you know, we would train faculty on our AV systems, on the various classrooms it'd be in.

589
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:38,012
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with 100% when you get people, their hands dirty when you get them, actually go through the motions.

590
00:48:38,893 --> 00:48:40,674
[SPEAKER_09]: Another thing that I'm a huge, huge fan of,

591
00:48:41,274 --> 00:48:43,474
[SPEAKER_09]: is printed out laminated help guides.

592
00:48:44,015 --> 00:48:58,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So once this kind of gets fully launched, that would be something that we would be implementing is getting a quick start guide with our phone number printed in big letters on it for any and all issues so people can reach out.

593
00:48:59,317 --> 00:49:00,697
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, 100% with you on that.

594
00:49:01,398 --> 00:49:09,779
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would also recommend that one computer be used for each board and commission as opposed to individuals bringing their own

595
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:23,212
[SPEAKER_13]: individuals using different different computers if we can have one computer in each workstation where each border commission has their own dedicated login I think that will cover pretty much the same concerns that we have but we have the, the, the ability to do it.

596
00:49:24,513 --> 00:49:29,757
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think that we need to make it streamlining consistent across the board that sounds like you're on top of it Kevin so thank you.

597
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Amendments, recommendations, however you want to put them forward.

598
00:49:36,872 --> 00:49:38,093
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't necessarily have to vote on them.

599
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:40,435
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Kevin wrote them down and I'm pretty confident in his ability.

600
00:49:40,455 --> 00:49:42,977
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been great since he's been here, so I'm not too worried about it.

601
00:49:44,598 --> 00:49:46,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate that.

602
00:49:46,259 --> 00:49:46,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

603
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,163
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have cameras in 207 and 201 already, correct?

604
00:49:51,544 --> 00:49:52,224
[SPEAKER_08]: In 207, yes.

605
00:49:52,404 --> 00:49:53,425
[SPEAKER_08]: In 201, I'm not sure.

606
00:49:53,485 --> 00:49:58,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought we passed some years back.

607
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:01,091
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought there was cameras set up in both.

608
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:02,893
[SPEAKER_08]: There should have been cameras set up in both of those rooms.

609
00:50:03,784 --> 00:50:13,634
[SPEAKER_08]: could be wrong but I think they were set up because they said we used to do most of our subcommittee meetings and meet homies, you know, and that small woman, and they were always broadcast.

610
00:50:14,034 --> 00:50:17,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, as far as the other one I, I could have sworn there was cameras.

611
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:21,682
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if you look into see if you know if we that technology still exists.

612
00:50:22,462 --> 00:50:25,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And again I remember we paid off a lot of money for that stuff.

613
00:50:25,926 --> 00:50:26,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Back then.

614
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:37,448
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can get a report from the administration where we stand on the IT director's position, if we hired anybody.

615
00:50:37,468 --> 00:50:44,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't heard of us hiring anybody, but I think that's a very important position.

616
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:50,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Office of Sustainability is doing, they seem to be the most important office in the building.

617
00:50:50,771 --> 00:50:52,472
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're involved in this,

618
00:50:54,706 --> 00:50:56,087
[SPEAKER_08]: that this is not what they should be doing.

619
00:50:56,647 --> 00:50:57,628
[SPEAKER_08]: They should be doing what they're doing.

620
00:50:57,668 --> 00:51:00,570
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, I don't know where we are with the IT director.

621
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:06,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, in this day and age, not having an IT director, I think it's just a recipe for disaster.

622
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:09,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Karwielik.

623
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:10,376
[SPEAKER_03]: How's our state?

624
00:51:10,676 --> 00:51:12,798
[SPEAKER_10]: I think you read my mind when it came to the quick start guide.

625
00:51:12,818 --> 00:51:16,040
[SPEAKER_10]: So that point is addressed.

626
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,621
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had one question.

627
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:22,984
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if you could also get a USB to USB-C converter.

628
00:51:25,142 --> 00:51:27,984
[SPEAKER_10]: He's already got it.

629
00:51:28,904 --> 00:51:34,107
[SPEAKER_10]: No, just because, you know, a lot of new computers are, you know, they're, it's USBC.

630
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:39,490
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think a lot of people walk into a meeting room, not, not knowing, right, that you need that converter.

631
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,771
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you so much.

632
00:51:41,171 --> 00:51:41,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

633
00:51:41,491 --> 00:51:45,613
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and, you know, not mean to be nothing to make it too, too light.

634
00:51:46,053 --> 00:51:46,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

635
00:51:47,633 --> 00:51:57,406
[SPEAKER_09]: This is also we're going to be testing all this equipment, and make sure that the USBC, you know that hub will properly identify the peripherals, and that kind of thing.

636
00:51:58,167 --> 00:52:02,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to briefly touch on Councilor Caraviello, I'm going to take a closer look at 201.

637
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:03,494
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's anything like 207.

638
00:52:05,777 --> 00:52:13,024
[SPEAKER_09]: 207 is set up with a camera with it's like a standard camera that goes BNC out to my head.

639
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:15,966
[SPEAKER_09]: I swear I'm not making these up.

640
00:52:19,027 --> 00:52:22,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll put it in a less lingo and a little bit more clear.

641
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:25,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Essentially, it's a standard video cable.

642
00:52:26,012 --> 00:52:26,953
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not USB.

643
00:52:27,253 --> 00:52:28,914
[SPEAKER_09]: We wouldn't be able to hook it up to a computer.

644
00:52:28,934 --> 00:52:43,945
[SPEAKER_09]: And the way that system is currently set up, I don't think it would be as agile and wouldn't be as, and potentially not as reliable as a newer solution that we'd be able to implement to have meetings in there.

645
00:52:44,005 --> 00:52:45,246
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do understand what you mean.

646
00:52:45,959 --> 00:52:47,440
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a camera.

647
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:54,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think we spent about $100,000 for the technology and all this stuff back then.

648
00:52:54,927 --> 00:53:05,157
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know it was supposed to have been updated yearly and I don't, it was new and they say, I don't know where it went awry.

649
00:53:06,018 --> 00:53:06,959
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, you're over my head.

650
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:10,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm that guy that's on TV, you know, he shows you your father and

651
00:53:12,548 --> 00:53:13,248
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that commercial?

652
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:14,009
[SPEAKER_08]: That's me.

653
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:17,391
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll keep it the gazindas and gazoutas.

654
00:53:17,431 --> 00:53:18,972
[SPEAKER_09]: This goes into this, this goes into this.

655
00:53:19,012 --> 00:53:20,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to put it on, I want it to work.

656
00:53:22,874 --> 00:53:24,715
[SPEAKER_10]: I have used the device you brought in before.

657
00:53:24,755 --> 00:53:30,879
[SPEAKER_10]: It works well in the classrooms I've been in.

658
00:53:30,979 --> 00:53:33,160
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is why people elected a 21-year-old.

659
00:53:41,736 --> 00:53:43,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you good.

660
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm good.

661
00:53:45,303 --> 00:53:45,683
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

662
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:51,213
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can only imagine what Kevin would do with $100,000 right would have a bar room full of boxes.

663
00:53:54,650 --> 00:54:05,296
[SPEAKER_11]: My two questions are, one, so for these two solutions, the 201 and 207, all we would need in order to go broadcast would be to have MCM in the Zoom room with us, right?

664
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:06,297
[SPEAKER_11]: That's correct.

665
00:54:06,517 --> 00:54:06,797
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

666
00:54:07,297 --> 00:54:07,838
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

667
00:54:07,898 --> 00:54:09,198
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can live broadcast.

668
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:14,741
[SPEAKER_11]: If MCM's in there, we could set up the recording and it'd be through MCM and through Zoom.

669
00:54:14,782 --> 00:54:17,583
[SPEAKER_11]: So we could have a double backup, it sounds like.

670
00:54:17,603 --> 00:54:18,684
[SPEAKER_11]: So that sounds great.

671
00:54:19,004 --> 00:54:19,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep.

672
00:54:19,987 --> 00:54:27,754
[SPEAKER_11]: About the other two spaces, it sounds like maybe the conference room at Medford High School that that might take, that might not have any infrastructure.

673
00:54:27,814 --> 00:54:29,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you been able to take a look at that at all?

674
00:54:29,776 --> 00:54:31,718
[SPEAKER_09]: So that one was one I wasn't aware of.

675
00:54:31,738 --> 00:54:36,402
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not sure which classroom was already scoped out.

676
00:54:36,843 --> 00:54:43,549
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't exactly sure what the scope of that install would be relative to 207-201, or if it's gonna be its own animal.

677
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:58,326
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't honestly I don't know the intent and I don't want to necessarily step on the toes of the school committee but I do know that they had used the superintendent's conference room for committees of the whole on occasion so I just didn't want to leave them out of the resolution has that had been a room but

678
00:54:58,988 --> 00:55:07,378
[SPEAKER_11]: You're in the building with you're in Medford high all often so that would be the folks to check with the superintendent believe it's a superintendents conference room.

679
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:16,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe a room next door to that and then just in terms of this room, I know we have a solution that works right now.

680
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:25,927
[SPEAKER_11]: My understanding was that this was kind of a jury-rigged solution that we came up with pretty quickly in 2020.

681
00:55:26,707 --> 00:55:30,931
[SPEAKER_11]: It has generally worked, but we have seen some issues with it.

682
00:55:32,092 --> 00:55:39,618
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember Mr. Gordon talking about some kind of box that we were looking to get for this room, I think, that would have better integrated some of the systems.

683
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:43,061
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not an expert either.

684
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,583
[SPEAKER_11]: So just, do you have any updates on this space and maybe

685
00:55:47,524 --> 00:55:48,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Any improvements that might be made here.

686
00:55:49,605 --> 00:55:50,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can answer that.

687
00:55:50,646 --> 00:55:55,848
[SPEAKER_09]: So this, this is one that I agree I've spent time in the booth.

688
00:55:56,429 --> 00:56:01,471
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I know we had issues with specifically the AV system in house here.

689
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,354
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, to part the curtain a little bit.

690
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:09,700
[SPEAKER_09]: These microphones individually, as far as we can tell, can't be adjusted on their own.

691
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:15,186
[SPEAKER_09]: So if someone's quiet, someone's loud, you can't really adjust the gain, which is pretty, pretty challenging.

692
00:56:16,487 --> 00:56:20,132
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I do think the system is a pretty good

693
00:56:21,537 --> 00:56:23,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Given the circumstances when it was put together.

694
00:56:23,499 --> 00:56:26,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to give Patrick my sincere.

695
00:56:27,604 --> 00:56:29,306
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm impressed I think you did a great job.

696
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:34,152
[SPEAKER_09]: If you wanted something that would be a little bit more streamlined, maybe.

697
00:56:35,713 --> 00:56:39,818
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, I've been, I'll be a little bit all over the place because this one's still kind of.

698
00:56:41,809 --> 00:56:44,452
[SPEAKER_09]: it's more kind of nebulous state as of right now.

699
00:56:45,272 --> 00:56:51,638
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've been in contact over email with members Rousseau and member Moose Stone from the school committee.

700
00:56:52,138 --> 00:56:56,302
[SPEAKER_09]: They've expressed some frustrations with the way things are set up specifically.

701
00:56:56,763 --> 00:57:03,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure you might be able to understand not having, you know, if you're used to the music world, not having a stage monitor.

702
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:04,610
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can't hear

703
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:10,213
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, people around in the chambers can't always hear the mic feed super well.

704
00:57:10,674 --> 00:57:13,876
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the speakers are all going that way and not this way.

705
00:57:14,636 --> 00:57:25,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And among other things, I think member Rousseau mentioned, you know, monitors in front of the Councilors so that you'd be able to see the Zoom without craning your neck 90 degrees.

706
00:57:26,625 --> 00:57:30,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And then in terms of the way the AV is connected in the booth,

707
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:43,117
[SPEAKER_09]: to kind of generalize, it is definitely a bunch of different components put together in a competent way, but in a way that, you know, wouldn't be super sustainable long term.

708
00:57:43,498 --> 00:57:45,459
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of failure points.

709
00:57:45,579 --> 00:57:55,508
[SPEAKER_09]: There's, from an audio perspective, there's too many gain stages, basically meaning there's too many places along the signal chain that the sound could kind of get either distorted or what have you.

710
00:57:56,568 --> 00:57:59,949
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of going forward, I don't mean to have everyone's eyes roll back their head.

711
00:58:01,789 --> 00:58:08,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not super experienced with putting in, whether it be an RFP, or asking for proposals.

712
00:58:09,671 --> 00:58:14,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I also wasn't exactly sure when I was talking about this with the members of the school committee.

713
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:17,394
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of who this would be under.

714
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:19,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't sure, was this going to be MCM budget?

715
00:58:20,295 --> 00:58:26,677
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like from what I looked at the schedule for today, that this would be under the ARPA funds.

716
00:58:27,217 --> 00:58:35,980
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would, you know, I'll have to figure out just the whys and wherefores of how to submit that properly, what is the paperwork, and that kind of thing.

717
00:58:36,649 --> 00:58:44,473
[SPEAKER_09]: but I'm definitely energized and amenable to moving this space forward because it gets a ton and ton of use.

718
00:58:45,914 --> 00:58:56,420
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we would be open to some of the quality of life adjustments that might make things easier for both the residents who are watching as well as for all of you on the other side of the bar here.

719
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:57,760
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thank you.

720
00:58:58,281 --> 00:58:58,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Kevin.

721
00:58:58,841 --> 00:59:02,003
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's pretty much the intent that I have would be to,

722
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:19,717
[SPEAKER_11]: make this create a permanent option in this room a permanent infrastructure that, you know, maybe it's a little easier to train someone on a little easier for someone to hop in if someone's out out sick or you know, and something that's long term sustainable I think that's really

723
00:59:20,983 --> 00:59:33,877
[SPEAKER_11]: really essential and I mentioned the ARPA funds because I do think this really falls very clearly under, you know, response to the pandemic in that situation and it seems to me to be valid.

724
00:59:33,957 --> 00:59:34,438
[SPEAKER_11]: I do believe

725
00:59:35,721 --> 00:59:42,007
[SPEAKER_11]: an RFP bidding process would go through the procurement office and it would be technically under the mayor.

726
00:59:42,108 --> 00:59:45,891
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything really is under the mayor at the end of the day and under our plan of government.

727
00:59:46,652 --> 00:59:59,345
[SPEAKER_11]: So that, but this is our, certainly our request would be a permanent technological solution for this space that's more adaptive, streamlined and will last for a long time.

728
00:59:59,585 --> 00:59:59,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

729
00:59:59,905 --> 01:00:09,587
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll add to that, you know, as that, as the wheels kind of get mo moving with that, uh, I'll be open to any of y'all's input on what you'd be looking for.

730
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, you know, don't want to leave you out of that.

731
01:00:12,368 --> 01:00:13,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't make a whole lot of sense.

732
01:00:14,128 --> 01:00:21,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, so I'll definitely be looking to, to feedback from all the members of whether it's school committee or city council for what they'd be looking for in a solution.

733
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:21,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

734
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:25,251
[SPEAKER_11]: And something you may not know, there is a, there is a screen up there too.

735
01:00:25,771 --> 01:00:26,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah.

736
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:27,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I've, I've clocked that screen.

737
01:00:27,992 --> 01:00:29,252
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely a screen.

738
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:33,133
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thank you very much.

739
01:00:33,173 --> 01:00:33,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam President.

740
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:34,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Knight.

741
01:00:36,073 --> 01:00:37,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, thank you very much.

742
01:00:37,614 --> 01:00:40,814
[SPEAKER_13]: All this talk about IT starts getting me thinking.

743
01:00:40,974 --> 01:00:56,438
[SPEAKER_13]: I know back when the mayor's office tried to force our former IT director to resign under the guise of what was said was IT vulnerabilities, and this council asked for a report back from the administration.

744
01:00:56,458 --> 01:00:57,738
[SPEAKER_13]: We never received that report.

745
01:00:59,492 --> 01:01:08,695
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that, you know, the termination of a former IT director was more around protected union activity than actual performance on the job, but that's just my opinion.

746
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:15,497
[SPEAKER_13]: But the reasoning that they gave when they terminated our former IT director was that there were IT vulnerabilities here in the city.

747
01:01:15,957 --> 01:01:26,801
[SPEAKER_13]: And at that time, this council had asked for a report back from the administration as to what those vulnerabilities were and what steps they was taking to protect the information that the residents in this community share with their government.

748
01:01:27,258 --> 01:01:31,139
[SPEAKER_13]: in the operations of the day-to-day delivery of services.

749
01:01:31,699 --> 01:01:50,686
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd just like to have the paper reset to the administration asking for an update because we've never received a response to that paper as to what these IT vulnerabilities are, what steps are being taken to secure them, and whether or not there will be a request for funding in the future necessary to make us so safe.

750
01:01:50,746 --> 01:01:54,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I still question the circumstances of the termination of our former IT director

751
01:01:55,274 --> 01:02:01,558
[SPEAKER_13]: He was in the middle of, uh, of organizing members of the administration to join a labor union.

752
01:02:01,778 --> 01:02:06,821
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, he was terminated with, uh, really no warning and no progressive discipline.

753
01:02:07,221 --> 01:02:10,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, so it raises a number of concerns for me, but the administration to give a reason.

754
01:02:11,004 --> 01:02:15,366
[SPEAKER_13]: And they said the reason was it vulnerabilities and the council still has not received a report on that.

755
01:02:15,707 --> 01:02:19,589
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's something that could become very costly to this council in this city in the future.

756
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:21,250
[SPEAKER_13]: If in fact there really are.

757
01:02:21,842 --> 01:02:22,883
[SPEAKER_13]: IT vulnerabilities.

758
01:02:23,203 --> 01:02:38,651
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't know because we haven't gotten the report, but if we do get a report, then we might be able to position ourselves to figure out how much is it going to cost us in the future when the budget discussions start as to how to address these IT vulnerabilities, along with these other very positive IT issues that are coming along that Kevin's bringing to the table.

759
01:02:39,112 --> 01:02:48,857
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd just like to offer that as a B paper to make sure that the administration responds to the prior paper requesting what the IT vulnerabilities were surrounding the termination of a prior IT director.

760
01:02:50,989 --> 01:02:51,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

761
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:53,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

762
01:02:53,451 --> 01:02:53,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng?

763
01:02:55,432 --> 01:03:01,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you would know the answer to this, but I was curious as to what we do with technology that we don't use anymore.

764
01:03:02,797 --> 01:03:10,463
[SPEAKER_10]: As you mentioned, perhaps trying two different systems and maybe like choosing one over the other, which suggests the other one might be put into a closet or something.

765
01:03:10,863 --> 01:03:13,705
[SPEAKER_10]: I was wondering if there was any program here to

766
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:25,810
[SPEAKER_10]: reuse the technology in different departments or, you know, different departments in the city for different rooms, maybe to give it to the high school, to the Boke, if they needed it.

767
01:03:26,931 --> 01:03:37,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course, a lot of this old technology is stuff that people won't want, but I, you know, for the pieces of technology that we can reuse, I was wondering if we had some program or something like that.

768
01:03:37,969 --> 01:03:39,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's an excellent question.

769
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:41,371
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not something I'm aware of at the moment.

770
01:03:42,071 --> 01:03:43,652
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something I would love to find out myself.

771
01:03:45,152 --> 01:03:53,176
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the good news, I would say in MCM and the studio proper is we're currently in the process of, we are updating our technology.

772
01:03:53,973 --> 01:03:58,638
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to have, in a lot of cases, it's things that we don't quite yet have.

773
01:03:59,739 --> 01:04:05,604
[SPEAKER_09]: But in terms of, yeah, with obsolete stuff, especially anything with a microchip in it, with lead, mercury, et cetera, has to be handled properly.

774
01:04:05,624 --> 01:04:08,547
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something I, is a good point.

775
01:04:08,587 --> 01:04:09,648
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to look into that myself.

776
01:04:09,768 --> 01:04:14,893
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know the answer at the moment, but certainly something that I think would be good for me to get a handle on.

777
01:04:15,453 --> 01:04:21,219
[SPEAKER_09]: So that, like you said, in these these rooms, whether it's here or elsewhere, we kind of have a home for everything.

778
01:04:21,239 --> 01:04:26,924
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not just going to be either collecting dust and storage or, you know, improperly disposed elsewhere.

779
01:04:27,085 --> 01:04:28,586
[SPEAKER_09]: So I take your point.

780
01:04:28,626 --> 01:04:29,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll make sure to look into that.

781
01:04:29,507 --> 01:04:32,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I mean, further discussion.

782
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:38,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I just could, from the chair, piggyback on Councilor Tseng and what Councilor Caraviello was saying.

783
01:04:38,358 --> 01:04:46,981
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my understanding that, you know, the large upfront costs of outfitting 207, there was also a whole software program that went with the management of that.

784
01:04:47,501 --> 01:04:56,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious if there's been cost savings or we're, you know, or we've realized to stop paying for that because we haven't had a committee of the whole in there since the beginning of the pandemic.

785
01:04:56,983 --> 01:04:59,144
[SPEAKER_03]: So it hasn't been being utilized in that way.

786
01:05:00,424 --> 01:05:06,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just want to make sure if we're not going to be using that setup, that we're also not paying for the software service that goes with it.

787
01:05:06,985 --> 01:05:07,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

788
01:05:07,365 --> 01:05:10,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you, um, madam president, do you recall the name of the software by any chance?

789
01:05:11,126 --> 01:05:11,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not.

790
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:20,387
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go, it's not like legislative tracking something, I think it was called by pre pandemic committees as a whole.

791
01:05:20,868 --> 01:05:22,708
[SPEAKER_03]: They exist in that software.

792
01:05:23,288 --> 01:05:23,888
[SPEAKER_03]: I can find it.

793
01:05:23,908 --> 01:05:28,909
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something like, I don't know why I have the URL, but it's like IQ M two.

794
01:05:31,175 --> 01:05:33,276
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a system that other cities use.

795
01:05:33,476 --> 01:05:37,298
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems to be like a municipal service that's focused on cities.

796
01:05:37,378 --> 01:05:42,220
[SPEAKER_11]: It sounds to me, honestly, a little bit like it's kind of designed to flee cities a little bit.

797
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,562
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be a little bit of a Windows 3.1 solution.

798
01:05:45,602 --> 01:05:46,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it is.

799
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:53,126
[SPEAKER_11]: The websites in other cities, it's like you have to go to this specific website to access recordings and it does look like Windows 98.

800
01:05:55,587 --> 01:06:00,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I can't remember, it may be related to, is it related to the MuniCode service?

801
01:06:01,675 --> 01:06:05,559
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe through this, it may be related to this Granicus service as well.

802
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:11,687
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been looking at those contracts, they're kind of wild, but I didn't, I don't know if I have the video one, so.

803
01:06:13,093 --> 01:06:14,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so excellent question.

804
01:06:14,114 --> 01:06:23,899
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll look into that and see if there's, I would certainly help if there's, if it is a SAS situation with some kind of monthly cost, we'll make sure to terminate that.

805
01:06:24,019 --> 01:06:30,442
[SPEAKER_09]: As long as, like you said, as long as it's not bundled with something else, it's actually a la carte and we can extricate it.

806
01:06:31,403 --> 01:06:33,504
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's another good question that I'll look into.

807
01:06:33,584 --> 01:06:33,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

808
01:06:34,184 --> 01:06:34,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

809
01:06:36,045 --> 01:06:37,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further discussion?

810
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:40,908
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the- With approval.

811
01:06:41,768 --> 01:06:42,609
[SPEAKER_03]: that we will take first.

812
01:06:45,272 --> 01:06:47,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, you're the language for a ZP paper.

813
01:07:05,575 --> 01:07:06,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have a second on the beat paper?

814
01:07:07,076 --> 01:07:12,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Second on the motion of Councilor Knight on the beat paper second by vice president bears.

815
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:13,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

816
01:07:14,043 --> 01:07:14,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice president bears.

817
01:07:15,404 --> 01:07:15,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

818
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

819
01:07:17,286 --> 01:07:17,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

820
01:07:17,766 --> 01:07:18,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

821
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:19,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

822
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:20,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

823
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:21,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

824
01:07:23,151 --> 01:07:23,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

825
01:07:24,052 --> 01:07:24,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

826
01:07:25,734 --> 01:07:25,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor

827
01:07:27,567 --> 01:07:28,948
[SPEAKER_06]: President Morell.

828
01:07:28,988 --> 01:07:30,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, 7-0 in the negative, the motion passes.

829
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:42,280
[SPEAKER_03]: On the main paper, on the motion of Councilor Knight, as amended by Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

830
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:44,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

831
01:07:46,183 --> 01:07:47,465
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the language for both those amendments?

832
01:07:47,485 --> 01:07:49,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the language for the amendments.

833
01:07:49,606 --> 01:07:50,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's the second one?

834
01:07:50,607 --> 01:07:51,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

835
01:07:56,582 --> 01:07:58,343
[SPEAKER_06]: main paper as a minute vice president bears.

836
01:07:58,403 --> 01:07:58,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

837
01:07:58,763 --> 01:08:01,104
[SPEAKER_06]: That's trivial.

838
01:08:01,264 --> 01:08:01,504
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

839
01:08:02,265 --> 01:08:02,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

840
01:08:02,465 --> 01:08:02,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

841
01:08:02,565 --> 01:08:02,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

842
01:08:03,285 --> 01:08:03,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

843
01:08:04,766 --> 01:08:05,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

844
01:08:05,106 --> 01:08:05,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

845
01:08:05,806 --> 01:08:06,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

846
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:08,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Kevin.

847
01:08:09,528 --> 01:08:09,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

848
01:08:22,203 --> 01:08:23,664
[SPEAKER_03]: 22-334 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

849
01:08:23,684 --> 01:08:28,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the DCR clean the median strip at Route 16 by the Main Street Bridge.

850
01:08:28,106 --> 01:08:35,329
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a second request, Councilor Caraviello.

851
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:37,190
[SPEAKER_03]: 22-335 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

852
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:42,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Be it resolved that the DCR remove the debris and trees left at the woods by Hastings Lane after their tree cutting.

853
01:08:42,272 --> 01:08:43,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

854
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:59,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we all drive down there from as soon as you turn, you look on both sides of the road and you see mattresses, you see couches, you see all kinds of rubbish.

855
01:09:00,764 --> 01:09:08,533
[SPEAKER_08]: And now as soon as you get up to the Route 16, the bridge on Main Street, that growth hasn't been cut in three years.

856
01:09:09,113 --> 01:09:10,555
[SPEAKER_08]: There's this crap all over the place.

857
01:09:10,595 --> 01:09:12,677
[SPEAKER_08]: And you look down on the side of both of those ramps,

858
01:09:13,558 --> 01:09:15,179
[SPEAKER_08]: crap all over the side of the road.

859
01:09:15,219 --> 01:09:17,941
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my, I request this every year.

860
01:09:17,961 --> 01:09:21,363
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the second, occasionally they come and play, but that hasn't been cleaned in three years.

861
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:27,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if you're going a little further over to the Hastings woods, which is between, it's right after Hastings lane.

862
01:09:28,949 --> 01:09:33,272
[SPEAKER_08]: The DCI was there last week, cut all the trees down, just dumped them there.

863
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:38,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, that woods was a mess anyways before that.

864
01:09:38,583 --> 01:09:43,466
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, they just cut the trees and just leave them on the ground, just leave them there.

865
01:09:43,526 --> 01:09:46,288
[SPEAKER_08]: There's neighbors there, and the neighbors deserve more than that.

866
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:51,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And the residents of our city deserve more than what we're getting on that whole road.

867
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:57,115
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, Route 16 has just turned into a dumping ground all over the place.

868
01:09:57,675 --> 01:10:02,338
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's about time that someone steps up, either the mayor or we go to our state delegation,

869
01:10:03,138 --> 01:10:05,161
[SPEAKER_08]: get this done, but it's got to get cleaned up.

870
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:05,722
[SPEAKER_08]: It's filthy.

871
01:10:05,783 --> 01:10:07,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think a sweep has been down there in years.

872
01:10:08,578 --> 01:10:15,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And I say, you know, especially on that main street bridge, the debris is five and six feet tall, there's cans, there's tires, there's everything all over the place.

873
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:18,421
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about time, it's gotta get cleaned up.

874
01:10:18,901 --> 01:10:20,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Our city deserves more than that.

875
01:10:20,621 --> 01:10:22,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it's something we talked about in the past.

876
01:10:22,902 --> 01:10:27,343
[SPEAKER_08]: The curb appeal of our city is horrible, and that's one of the reasons for it.

877
01:10:27,883 --> 01:10:31,904
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I don't know if we wanna send a letter to our state delegation to get it done, or,

878
01:10:34,145 --> 01:10:35,327
[SPEAKER_08]: off the mayor wants to call it again.

879
01:10:35,888 --> 01:10:38,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, that it has to get cleaned up by the spring.

880
01:10:39,014 --> 01:10:43,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't just let it go another year with nothing happening that think that's for real.

881
01:10:43,902 --> 01:10:45,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Madam President.

882
01:10:45,545 --> 01:10:46,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean,

883
01:10:47,778 --> 01:10:49,059
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm right there with you on all of this.

884
01:10:49,139 --> 01:10:53,822
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we could basically say, please look at every DCR property in the city of Medford and fix it.

885
01:10:54,322 --> 01:11:10,732
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that's just the beautification type things we're experiencing right now, with very little warning on Fells Way West that they're redoing all of the sidewalk from Mystic Valley Parkway at Wellington Circle all the way up to Fulton Street at route 28.

886
01:11:11,232 --> 01:11:15,255
[SPEAKER_11]: We got that notice like a week before they started the project.

887
01:11:16,024 --> 01:11:18,205
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, now we have people having a hard time again.

888
01:11:18,706 --> 01:11:25,790
[SPEAKER_11]: They've just dug up the new safe routes to school project on Fells Way West, and they're refilling the sidewalks.

889
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:26,791
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's just a mess.

890
01:11:26,891 --> 01:11:29,632
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone who lives over there, they're leaving it for weeks.

891
01:11:29,712 --> 01:11:32,714
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard to cross the street on a street that's already dangerous to cross.

892
01:11:32,774 --> 01:11:39,939
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I certainly support improvements and all of that, but it's just not happening in a responsible way and in a responsibly communicated way.

893
01:11:40,519 --> 01:11:54,145
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the same time, you know, in addition to the construction materials that have been left, you know, we have some sections of Fellsway West that are similar to like Hastings Woods, where you have just woods right on the, you know, on the north side of Fellsway West.

894
01:11:55,025 --> 01:11:57,026
[SPEAKER_11]: That's pretty nasty all the time too.

895
01:11:57,386 --> 01:12:01,488
[SPEAKER_11]: And then everything around Roosevelt Circle, which is right where I live, is really just gross.

896
01:12:01,588 --> 01:12:03,829
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I'm not adding an amendment.

897
01:12:03,849 --> 01:12:04,770
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not anything substantive.

898
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:06,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just mentioning it.

899
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:09,932
[SPEAKER_08]: DCR has just neglected our community in a giant way.

900
01:12:10,512 --> 01:12:14,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that was on purpose or whatever, but we're a mess.

901
01:12:14,553 --> 01:12:17,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I do know that there is a DCR coalition.

902
01:12:17,874 --> 01:12:24,736
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a report, you know, we did have, remember the Foundation Budget Review Commission report about K-12 school funding?

903
01:12:25,416 --> 01:12:30,797
[SPEAKER_11]: They just did a similar report around DCR funding that says it's drastically underfunded and the state needs to step up.

904
01:12:30,918 --> 01:12:32,458
[SPEAKER_11]: There are people who are advocating

905
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:33,699
[SPEAKER_11]: around that.

906
01:12:34,599 --> 01:12:44,444
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do want to give a shout out to everyone in the community who has been trying to get the state to step up and get DC artists step up but it's really abysmal so thank you for putting this forward.

907
01:12:46,865 --> 01:12:51,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Madam President, one of the many emails I've received about all the wonderful things going on in this community.

908
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:55,462
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard that the administration was putting together a community wide cleanup.

909
01:12:55,522 --> 01:13:02,827
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would suggest that we forward this resolution to her office and ask that she put this in as part of her community wide cleanup efforts that are coming up in just a few short weeks.

910
01:13:04,868 --> 01:13:06,009
[SPEAKER_08]: This might be over their head.

911
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:08,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Shocking.

912
01:13:15,135 --> 01:13:17,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Seems like Councilor Carvial has rejected you.

913
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:26,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Any further discussion sounds like political theater and the council president.

914
01:13:28,842 --> 01:13:29,643
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought they could do it.

915
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:38,668
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll take what you do that three three four first on the motion of Councilor Carlyle seconded by a motion to join.

916
01:13:38,688 --> 01:13:39,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

917
01:13:40,069 --> 01:13:42,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to join and approve.

918
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:53,034
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, there we go.

919
01:13:53,074 --> 01:13:59,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to join papers 2234 and 2235 and approved by Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

920
01:14:03,202 --> 01:14:05,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

921
01:14:06,344 --> 01:14:08,146
[SPEAKER_03]: It works.

922
01:14:09,367 --> 01:14:10,167
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Bears?

923
01:14:10,387 --> 01:14:10,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

924
01:14:11,708 --> 01:14:12,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello?

925
01:14:12,629 --> 01:14:12,889
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

926
01:14:13,229 --> 01:14:13,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins?

927
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:14,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

928
01:14:16,432 --> 01:14:16,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

929
01:14:17,513 --> 01:14:17,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

930
01:14:19,135 --> 01:14:19,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpello?

931
01:14:20,136 --> 01:14:20,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

932
01:14:20,776 --> 01:14:21,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng?

933
01:14:21,577 --> 01:14:21,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

934
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:22,698
[SPEAKER_06]: President Morocco?

935
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, 7-4-0, the negative, the motion passed.

936
01:14:26,601 --> 01:14:27,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President?

937
01:14:27,522 --> 01:14:28,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello?

938
01:14:28,523 --> 01:14:37,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we adjourn this evening, if I could take a moment to, a little sorrow tonight, we're losing Kinga Burundi.

939
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:41,708
[SPEAKER_08]: She's going up to the big house, going up to the state house.

940
01:14:42,448 --> 01:14:49,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Going up to the big house there, and I just want to thank her for her work.

941
01:14:50,215 --> 01:14:57,201
[SPEAKER_08]: I've told her personally, and I think she's probably the best reporter we've had since I've been on the city council.

942
01:14:57,261 --> 01:15:00,504
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, she's been fair and honest with everybody, asked the right questions.

943
01:15:00,924 --> 01:15:04,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Just want to thank her for her work, and sorry we're losing her.

944
01:15:05,941 --> 01:15:14,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the combination of all these, the regionalization of the papers, people get less and less news now.

945
01:15:15,247 --> 01:15:21,031
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, I just want to thank Kinga for her good work and good luck on her job at the State House.

946
01:15:24,081 --> 01:15:31,413
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to agree with Councilor Caraviello but I also want to say that, certainly while I respect and enjoy King is coverage.

947
01:15:31,873 --> 01:15:35,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the truest shame and I hope we would all agree is that.

948
01:15:37,202 --> 01:15:39,925
[SPEAKER_11]: The for profit market has decided that this beat doesn't matter.

949
01:15:40,485 --> 01:15:44,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it really does the local government beat is incredibly important.

950
01:15:46,431 --> 01:15:56,442
[SPEAKER_11]: I for one have gone back through the microfilm archives that this city has of our transcript and the former daily mercury and.

951
01:15:57,022 --> 01:16:05,893
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, when we had a 20-30 page daily paper in this community, it was just amazing the things that you can see and you can find.

952
01:16:06,454 --> 01:16:07,255
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, you know,

953
01:16:08,505 --> 01:16:22,250
[SPEAKER_11]: God forbid for all of us now we're going to be, you know, confined to trying to find something on a Facebook archive that doesn't exist from a company that doesn't care about us at all, just to find out what happened in the community.

954
01:16:22,270 --> 01:16:28,852
[SPEAKER_11]: This week, you know, and that goes from everything big to small from city budget and taxes and

955
01:16:29,672 --> 01:16:43,258
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the great dramas that I've read from the 50s and 60s of our city government, right down to, you know, who won the ballgame and when is the sign up for the local, you know, arts festival or whatever it may be.

956
01:16:43,338 --> 01:16:51,001
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do want to thank everyone who does their best to get that information out there in the ways that we have now.

957
01:16:52,042 --> 01:16:57,064
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it's a big loss to not have a paper dedicated to covering this community.

958
01:16:57,664 --> 01:16:58,745
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think

959
01:16:59,501 --> 01:17:10,488
[SPEAKER_11]: We all know that the stories here are rich and vibrant and sometimes contentious, and that we will be at a great loss to not have that.

960
01:17:10,728 --> 01:17:13,310
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you, Councilor Caraviello, thank you.

961
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:19,874
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Kinga, and thank you to everybody who came before you who reported on this community.

962
01:17:19,894 --> 01:17:24,858
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope someday soon we'll be able to say that there are reporters back here talking about the city of Minford.

963
01:17:25,118 --> 01:17:25,438
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

964
01:17:25,918 --> 01:17:27,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Schell.

965
01:17:27,379 --> 01:17:27,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you again.

966
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:30,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks Rick for bringing that up.

967
01:17:30,691 --> 01:17:41,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Kenga, you've dealt with a lot of reporters in our days and I think that you have by far been the most fair and we appreciate that.

968
01:17:42,961 --> 01:17:44,983
[SPEAKER_04]: There are times when you don't agree

969
01:17:45,519 --> 01:17:59,936
[SPEAKER_04]: You disagree, you might disagree what you you right but you are always fair, there's always two sides, and at least you've tried you can see that you made an effort to look at both sides and I think that that's that says a lot.

970
01:18:01,478 --> 01:18:15,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that it makes me angry and sad for the fact that I talked to one of the one of the editors just a few years ago when she told me that the commitment of this newspaper was really to go back to the roots of community.

971
01:18:15,964 --> 01:18:18,806
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we are looking at the total opposite.

972
01:18:18,866 --> 01:18:24,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will express my displeasure to her personally tomorrow again.

973
01:18:24,988 --> 01:18:28,470
[SPEAKER_04]: And I won't hesitate to call them a liar because they lied.

974
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:28,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean,

975
01:18:30,342 --> 01:18:32,444
[SPEAKER_04]: They came to me for two reasons.

976
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:44,332
[SPEAKER_04]: One, as a city councilor and two, covering my position in the neighboring community, where they wanted to maybe push the community aspect and really get really community based.

977
01:18:45,032 --> 01:18:47,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of doing that, they've turned it all around.

978
01:18:47,814 --> 01:18:56,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And now what I've heard from a lot of people, from all sides, it's just, they're all disappointed that there is no,

979
01:18:57,825 --> 01:19:11,533
[SPEAKER_04]: there is no message to be sent or they can read online or get that paper and share the information that a lot of people still like to get.

980
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:15,175
[SPEAKER_04]: That newspaper is something that's very important to people's lives.

981
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:21,839
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe not to the younger generation, but to the older generation, it's a huge part of

982
01:19:22,685 --> 01:19:23,685
[SPEAKER_04]: what they do every day.

983
01:19:23,945 --> 01:19:26,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sad that we're seeing that go.

984
01:19:26,306 --> 01:19:31,548
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I'm sure you'll do great things at the Statehouse, but I'm not happy about that.

985
01:19:31,808 --> 01:19:34,009
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but thank you for everything you've done.

986
01:19:34,029 --> 01:19:36,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to thank you as well, Kinga, for

987
01:19:40,185 --> 01:19:51,751
[SPEAKER_10]: being one of these, you know, there's certain people you see in the chamber every week and as a new Councilor, it's those people that make you feel welcome and help you ease into the position.

988
01:19:52,271 --> 01:20:01,736
[SPEAKER_10]: And Kinga, you've really helped me personally ease into this job and learn more about, you know, what it is like to be a Councilor just by talking to you.

989
01:20:02,856 --> 01:20:04,297
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll miss you a lot.

990
01:20:04,897 --> 01:20:06,278
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is a shame that

991
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:11,013
[SPEAKER_10]: corporate interests have decided that local news is going by the wayside.

992
01:20:11,593 --> 01:20:18,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, I mean, as as Councilor various has put it, going back into the archives can be an amazing experience.

993
01:20:19,605 --> 01:20:40,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Speaking as someone who comes from the academic realm, someone who works with historians and works with activists, it's actually the historical archives that teach you so much about social movements, about economics, about politics, about what works today and what lessons that we can drop in the past.

994
01:20:42,021 --> 01:20:47,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, a really great example of this is I was in South Carolina right before the pandemic,

995
01:20:48,646 --> 01:20:55,934
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a lot of organizing there about a local issue, where they're, you know, redeveloping all these condos.

996
01:20:56,940 --> 01:21:02,303
[SPEAKER_10]: And the grounds that they're trying to redevelop is actually historically black.

997
01:21:03,083 --> 01:21:15,209
[SPEAKER_10]: And by redeveloping the grounds, they're massively altering the environment that used to exist there, that black residents have lived off of for years, and all this alterations caused flooding and all of that.

998
01:21:15,669 --> 01:21:21,612
[SPEAKER_10]: But what struck me most on that trip was when I talked to the local activists, when I asked them, how did you even,

999
01:21:22,312 --> 01:21:25,693
[SPEAKER_10]: think about organizing around this issue, or how did you even come to care about this issue?

1000
01:21:25,813 --> 01:21:32,874
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really, their answer was going back to look at local news back in the 1920s and 1930s, looking at the microfilms.

1001
01:21:33,834 --> 01:21:44,116
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that experience really taught me how valuable local news coverage is to our future.

1002
01:21:44,216 --> 01:21:48,957
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not even just about next Sunday or next week, it's about 2080.

1003
01:21:51,614 --> 01:22:07,889
[SPEAKER_10]: 2180, right, like when people are looking back at Medford and they're learning about, through local news, they have a chance to learn about what our community looked like and they have a chance to learn about, you know, what has changed in the last X number of years.

1004
01:22:10,263 --> 01:22:13,846
[SPEAKER_10]: they have a chance to learn about what environmental justice looks like in our community.

1005
01:22:13,906 --> 01:22:22,712
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a chance to look at what economics looks like in our community, or what businesses, or even just social, you know, like who's playing at what baseball game.

1006
01:22:23,153 --> 01:22:26,335
[SPEAKER_10]: And it really is a shame that that is going away.

1007
01:22:26,575 --> 01:22:35,922
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really, speaking as someone who works with archival material, it's just really a shame that we're not gonna have that in the future.

1008
01:22:36,943 --> 01:22:37,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Osanic.

1009
01:22:37,944 --> 01:22:38,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello.

1010
01:22:38,635 --> 01:22:39,936
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Madam President.

1011
01:22:39,996 --> 01:22:47,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Being the older than everyone here, before I was on the council, you had the Method Mercury.

1012
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:54,761
[SPEAKER_08]: And not only did the residents hold you accountable, but the Method Mercury held you accountable.

1013
01:22:55,261 --> 01:23:00,843
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was one of the days of Alfresco, as they called it, the poison pen.

1014
01:23:02,975 --> 01:23:11,682
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mercury was out here daily, and I said, they scrutinized every move government made in the city.

1015
01:23:12,282 --> 01:23:22,670
[SPEAKER_08]: And the papers, they decided who got elected and who didn't get elected by the editorials were strong then and big readership.

1016
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:24,752
[SPEAKER_08]: But now, like I said, the Council of Businessmen,

1017
01:23:25,452 --> 01:23:27,854
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, news is important.

1018
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:29,315
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like I said, what are we going to do?

1019
01:23:29,335 --> 01:23:32,117
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get our news off of our telephones and our computers.

1020
01:23:32,537 --> 01:23:36,200
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, not everybody gets news that way.

1021
01:23:36,780 --> 01:23:40,322
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a shame that, you know, I'll call you.

1022
01:23:40,563 --> 01:23:42,004
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to call Nell again.

1023
01:23:42,024 --> 01:23:43,745
[SPEAKER_08]: I've talked to Nell about this.

1024
01:23:44,946 --> 01:23:50,910
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I think it's just a poor, poor decision to leave all these communities in the lurch with, again,

1025
01:23:51,463 --> 01:23:53,344
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no news at all.

1026
01:23:53,364 --> 01:23:57,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, King, are they still going to have like an online paper or is this going to be a regional thing?

1027
01:24:01,349 --> 01:24:01,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Come to the mic.

1028
01:24:02,129 --> 01:24:04,270
[SPEAKER_08]: You're a star tonight.

1029
01:24:04,291 --> 01:24:12,215
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to be a star tonight.

1030
01:24:12,775 --> 01:24:16,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've been told is that we're going to be covering topics.

1031
01:24:17,703 --> 01:24:22,145
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that I will be covering the State House with a second reporter.

1032
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:31,149
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be reporters that are covering development, but it's not going to be Medford's development, it's going to be development through the region.

1033
01:24:32,004 --> 01:24:37,526
[SPEAKER_02]: the wicked local region, which is like east of Worcester, Worcester, sorry.

1034
01:24:40,268 --> 01:24:45,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So east of Worcester and then down towards New Bedford.

1035
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:53,774
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to be taking topics because they figured out through algorithms and

1036
01:24:54,474 --> 01:25:03,158
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, analysts' analysis of who reads what, that people are more interested in general topics than in local news.

1037
01:25:04,898 --> 01:25:08,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I beg to differ, but you know, what can I tell you?

1038
01:25:09,287 --> 01:25:20,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it's a shame, you know, the newspaper in the past has always played a key role in the community, whether, and not just government events, social events and social things and, you know, sports and everything.

1039
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:32,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And all these, these young, these young people who play sports are never ever going to get to see their name in the paper or picture in the paper, which is a, which is a shame that you kind of look forward, you know, that, you know, you kind of look forward to that.

1040
01:25:32,851 --> 01:25:33,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And again,

1041
01:25:34,182 --> 01:25:49,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for, you know, for the short time you did an outstanding job, but I hope someone picks up the gavel and maybe comes in with another paper here because it's a shame to go without anyone holding anybody accountable now.

1042
01:25:50,117 --> 01:25:50,998
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what's gonna happen.

1043
01:25:51,458 --> 01:25:55,182
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nobody holding anybody accountable for anything, so.

1044
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:57,424
[SPEAKER_02]: And you did do that.

1045
01:25:58,663 --> 01:26:01,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody knows my number, feel free to call me.

1046
01:26:01,105 --> 01:26:03,366
[SPEAKER_02]: So, absolutely.

1047
01:26:03,747 --> 01:26:15,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I say, you know, you say, you know, in your short time here, you did an outstanding job, you held people accountable and you always spoke the truth, you know, whether we liked it or we didn't like it, it was the truth.

1048
01:26:15,495 --> 01:26:22,800
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, I thank you and I hope some other company steps up and comes back here with some kind of newspaper because

1049
01:26:23,183 --> 01:26:24,664
[SPEAKER_08]: It is an, it is integral.

1050
01:26:25,545 --> 01:26:32,249
[SPEAKER_08]: And they say, not just for the government, but for the social scene and sports scene again, and to have nothing just to keep looking on.

1051
01:26:32,889 --> 01:26:39,293
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the reason people sit there on their phones all day and night because they, again, there's no news coming out of anywhere.

1052
01:26:39,814 --> 01:26:40,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I get it.

1053
01:26:40,514 --> 01:26:43,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you again for, and you're going to be missed here.

1054
01:26:43,656 --> 01:26:46,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for making me welcome for talking to me.

1055
01:26:48,413 --> 01:26:56,476
[SPEAKER_02]: for making my Tuesday nights enjoyable, frustrating, and long sometimes, but thank you so much.

1056
01:26:57,916 --> 01:27:01,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello, and I echo all my fellow councilors' sentiments.

1057
01:27:01,157 --> 01:27:05,999
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a loss for the city, it's a loss for the council, and I thank you for your service, Kinga.

1058
01:27:07,299 --> 01:27:09,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on to public participation.

1059
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:14,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anyone on Zoom who would like to speak in public participation, saying so because there is no one else in the chambers?

1060
01:27:16,991 --> 01:27:22,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing no hands, that is the end of the new agenda.

1061
01:27:22,513 --> 01:27:26,815
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1062
01:27:26,835 --> 01:27:28,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1063
01:27:29,336 --> 01:27:30,877
[SPEAKER_03]: With Councilor Knight is no longer on.

1064
01:27:49,469 --> 01:27:50,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli, would you like to adjourn?

1065
01:27:50,871 --> 01:27:53,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just say, yes.

1066
01:27:53,917 --> 01:27:54,518
[SPEAKER_06]: President Morell.

1067
01:27:54,898 --> 01:27:57,843
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, 16 in affirmative, one absent, the meeting is adjourned.
