    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=90.489s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=92.29s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=92.731s">Signing</a>  the firm is here in the negative and rules are suspended. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=95.732s">22-337.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=96.333s">April</a>  15th, 2022 to President Nicole Morell and honorable members of the Medford City Council for Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn regarding the Community Preservation Committee appropriation requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=107.179s">Dear</a>  President Morell and members of the Medford City Council, on behalf of the Community Preservation Committee, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following recommendations of the Community Preservation Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=118.725s">requesting</a>  the appropriation of $100,000 from the CPA Historic Reserve to the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability slash Civic Auditorium and Convention Center Commission for the facade restoration of the Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=131.27s">The</a>  project will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund by category Historic Reserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=135.551s">Enclosed,</a>  please find a copy of the project summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=138.172s">Thank</a>  you for your consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=139.513s">Respectfully</a>  submitted, Brenna Lambert-Hearn. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=141.594s">I</a>  do have the full enclosure, but I do see Roberta Cameron here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=147.815s">Councilors</a>  okay with that, we get to get an overview from Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=150.137s">Cameron,</a>  unless Councilors would like the full enclosure to be read.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=154.1s">Madam</a>  President, based upon the review of the paperwork, I see no issue or problem with this, and I would certainly move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=159.324s">We</a>  all know that the CPA application is a lengthy process that's properly vetted by at least nine members of our community that serve on various boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=167.73s">We've</a>  all spoken in favor of how much we support the Chevalier Auditorium and how much we want to see this auditorium be the economic driver in our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=175.873s">I</a>  think facade improvements is something that we've all spoke about in the past I think this is something that I support wholeheartedly and I'm sure that my colleagues do as well, and I'll certainly move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=184.938s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=185.358s">So</a>  we have a motion from Councilor Knights to approve second by Councilor Kelly, as you do a word of Cameron here if you could just give us a brief overview of the paper.</p>

    <p>[Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=194.042s">Thank</a>  you is the mic on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=195.723s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=196.424s">All</a>  right, so Roberta North Street, and I am chair of the community preservation committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=203.818s">And</a>  I'm here to speak about the off-cycle application that we received for the Chevalier Theater restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=211.804s">This</a>  was brought to us in order to close a funding gap as they had received funding from other sources, but the cost of the project has escalated so that that's not sufficient to be able to complete the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=224.495s">And</a>  it is a very urgent project because the damage is ongoing right now and might threaten the safety of patrons entering the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=232.949s">So</a>  for that reason, the Community Preservation Committee voted to recommend funding for this project.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=242.551s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=243.391s">Any</a>  questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=246.992s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Sarpelli to approve the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=253.313s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=361.939s">Madam</a>  President is a member of this fund I am very grateful that the board has moved in its divine wisdom to make this cost of living adjustment applicable to more members in our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=373.102s">Ultimately,</a>  when we think about these individuals that are receiving these benefits, these are the people that are the ones that made our city great. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=378.063s">These</a>  are the ones that worked for 30 plus years dedicating their lives to public service so the metric could be the city that it is or once was. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=385.065s">So</a>  with that being said, I thank the retirement board for their efforts I think Mr. Jordan and Mr. Minerva especially, and I will move approval of the paper.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=394.524s">Any</a>  discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=396.445s">Councilor</a>  Karygiannis. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=399.706s">Councilor</a>  Karygiannis.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=415.911s">Good</a>  evening, President Morell, naming City Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=419.093s">My</a>  name is Rick Jordan. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=420.494s">I'm</a>  the Chairman of the Metro Retirement Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=422.475s">With</a>  me is Mark Minervini. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=424.616s">He</a>  is the Executive Director of the Retirement System. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=429.859s">We're</a>  here to request, through you, an increase in our base, our COLA base it's called. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=439.125s">a</a>  little bit of history, I'll use the year of 2021, because I have those numbers already prepared. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=449.755s">But</a>  for that year, we netted a 17.3 increase in our returns. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=462.865s">we</a>  went up to $259.5 million in value. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=465.026s">In</a>  the past nine years, our retirement board has grown nearly 33%. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=467.947s">It's</a>  over $9 million in the last nine years. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=472.469s">Year</a>  to date, <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=492.695s">figures,</a>  we've been positioned, it's been a down market for the first five months of this year, first four months of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=502.242s">The</a>  S&P is down 10% sometime between yesterday and today. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=509.006s">Our</a>  returns are down minus 3.8% because of the way we are positioned, conservatively positioned, and we've done very, very well for the members of our retirement board. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=523.05s">If</a>  you, I understand this is very complicated stuff, retirement stuff, but what we're looking for is an increase for our members from $16,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=534.655s">That's</a>  the base that we present our cost of living increase on, 16,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=539.117s">We</a>  wanna go to 18,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=542.997s">It's</a>  not a very, very large amount for us to absorb, but it's something that we feel is required based on inflation, especially within the last six, eight months. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=554.927s">And</a>  with your help, we can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=557.289s">So</a>  if you've got any questions, see what we can do for you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=560.932s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=563.575s">Councilor,</a>  I don't know if your hand is up again.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=565.736s">Yes,</a>  I'm just wondering if you could give us a breakdown as to what our unfunded pension liability is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=576.163s">Yep,</a>  so the percentage is what our percentages of the even if that makes it easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=580.606s">We're</a>  at 64% funded 64% funded and do I know we were we were on a, we were at a great clip to comply with the directives to, you know, make ourselves so sustainable and fully funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=595.175s">Are</a>  we still on track or has the second recession set us back a little bit in that regard.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=600.697s">Yeah,</a>  we're still on track. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=602.158s">We</a>  had some very strong returns last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=606.602s">Just</a>  as Rick mentioned, 17.3% return net of fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=611.686s">That</a>  netted us just a little under 40 million in investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=616.789s">So</a>  right now we're on target to be fully funded by 2033. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=620.472s">And</a>  what's the deadline that they gave us?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=621.913s">2040.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=622.914s">So</a>  we're seven years ahead of schedule.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=631.392s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=632.212s">Excellent</a>  job. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=632.953s">Excellent</a>  work. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=633.493s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=635.574s">Yeah,</a>  I just want to thank you too I think this is a difficult position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=645.258s">And</a>  I know when there's ever a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=648.46s">You're</a>  always there to help so we appreciate all your hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=651.881s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=826.239s">No,</a>  just refer to a committee of the whole Madam President to interview the applicant.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=834.143s">Like</a>  I said, she's probably a wonderful person. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=837.084s">I</a>  just, if I didn't see a resume or have anyone talking on behalf, I don't know who she is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=842.126s">So</a>  if I can, I don't know if we go to committee of the whole, but just to get her information, if there's any way that maybe for next week, if we can, you know, just table to next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=860.112s">Yeah,</a>  just to, I'd like to get the background if we can.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=863.761s">Well,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=865.222s">I</a>  mean, we do have, Director Beresford, we do have Sandy Gale here.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=868.424s">Okay,</a>  I was gonna say if we could maybe hear from Sandy Gale, but, you know, I didn't know Mr. Nardella. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=874.848s">I</a>  didn't, you know, I... At least, I'm saying at least there was a resume, you know, there was... Was there?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=881.211s">Yeah,</a>  at least I saw it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=883.293s">Well,</a>  I'd be happy to hear from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=884.593s">Yeah,</a>  no, if that's the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=885.694s">I</a>  just wanted some information.</p>

    <p>[Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=888.219s">Madam</a>  Mayor, Sandra Gale, election coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=893.341s">I</a>  cannot speak for the administration and I won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=897.022s">However,</a>  I can tell you that the candidate has been fully vetted and I'm sure that when she applied to be on the commission, one of the requirements is to produce some sort of CV or resume or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=912.987s">I</a>  have been told by one of the other commissioners who was approved last week <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=918.253s">that</a>  she does have community involvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=921.876s">And</a>  I would ask that the council move forward to confirm this candidate so that we can get our commissioners in place and we can continue to move forward with what we're doing with the elections department. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=939.629s">She</a>  has been fully vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=942.711s">And</a>  that was done by me.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=944.252s">So</a>  we have <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=949.347s">do</a>  you want to keep your motion.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=951.468s">Well</a>  my motion would be to have a committee of the whole to meet with the applicant to see who they are I appreciate the work that Sandy's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=958.172s">I</a>  glad that the administration finally stopped sitting on their hands after the primary election of last year to come around and start appointing people to these boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=967.797s">Ultimately,</a>  we're in a position now we're up against a wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=971.019s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=971.319s">We're</a>  up against a wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=973.519s">We</a>  don't have anybody that can even approve nomination papers for candidates that are running for state office right now in our community, because since September of 2021, the administration hasn't acted on vacancies that are in the registrar's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=984.585s">So</a>  much so that this council had moved to change the format of our elections office to establish an election commission from a board of registrars of voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=994.49s">So</a>  it's very frustrating to be put in this position. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=998.12s">I</a>  remember when I sat in that chair next to me a long ago when I had this was almost a quote that she'd say you know how can you give us something today and expect us to vote on it with no information. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1007.345s">I</a>  appreciate what Sandy's done in the office and I also appreciate what she has to say but this candidate has not fully been vetted. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1013.188s">The</a>  reason this candidate has not been fully vetted is because it requires Council approval, and the Council hasn't approved this candidate, and that is the vetting process that is the check and balance that we have for right. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1024.295s">That</a>  is the advice and consent process that's established <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1027.489s">when</a>  we establish one of these elections commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1030.251s">So</a>  my theory and my feeling would be that each one of these individuals should be put through a committee of the whole process, where we get to interview them, ask them some questions, talk to them and feel comfortable with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1040.299s">Because</a>  ultimately, we want someone that's going to be impartial, someone that's not going to bring politics into the game, someone that's going to act in the best interest of this community and not as an activist. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1048.185s">And</a>  those are things that you really can't find out unless you talk to somebody. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1051.407s">So</a>  those are my concerns with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1052.508s">And</a>  that's why I call for a committee of the whole, I'd let my motion rest on the table and hope a colleague would second it.</p>

    <p>[Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1059.638s">Madam</a>  President, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1063.779s">All</a>  of the nomination papers that we had been holding in queue were certified as of Thursday of last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1073.421s">I</a>  sent out an email notifying and thanking everyone for their collaboration in that effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1081.864s">Other</a>  than that, we are not behind the eight ball on anything that we're moving forward on. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1088.067s">the</a>  administration has been open to, this is what we need and this is how we need to get it.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1095.588s">So</a>  in that point, if there's no hurry, then let's have the committee of the whole, it sounds good to me, I like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1101.049s">We're</a>  not behind the eight ball and we're in a good spot, then let's vet this properly.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1105.89s">I</a>  do just want to note that last week there were three, there was actually 4% of the council, three were already voted through, so just noting for the process when you weren't here. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1116.977s">others?</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1117.497s">Yes,</a>  yes, I was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1118.398s">I</a>  had a child care issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1120.318s">Um,</a>  was not able to make the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1121.579s">You're</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1124.64s">It's</a>  the last part.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1129.001s">Not</a>  to say that the motion would have been the same had I been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1132.102s">It</a>  just, uh, the motion's gone and seconded so we can move on.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1138.084s">Is</a>  there a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1141.645s">There</a>  is no second for council next motion.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1143.206s">So</a>  I think what I was saying before it was kind of, it's just, I, it's either we know an applicant or we would read their resumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1154.812s">So</a>  we have an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1156.469s">I</a>  don't think I don't need a committee the whole meeting I think that if you read someone's resume I get to see who they were what what their background was I think that would be enough for me so to me to table this until we get just the resume this week to vote on it next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1171.467s">I</a>  don't think it will hold us up that much, but I just think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1175.995s">It,</a>  to me, that's, you know, we've gone through, like last week, we voted, like I said, I knew a few when I saw our resumes. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1182.96s">So</a>  to me, that gave me enough confidence with the, you know, the background check that was done by our city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1193.008s">So</a>  that would be my motion.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1196.11s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1196.731s">There</a>  is a motion on the table to table this from Councilor Scarpelli, and that is not debatable. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1202.095s">I</a>  do see Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1210.011s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1211.152s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to note, in general, I actually really do agree with points raised recently by <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1218.868s">Councilor</a>  Knight, I think that in general, you know, if something comes before us for approval, it shouldn't be a rubber stamp, it should be a reasoned and intentional decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1229.157s">That</a>  said, in this specific case, because we didn't hold a Committee of the Whole for the three applicants that were approved last week, I don't know that it would be fair in this case to hold a Committee of the Whole for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1239.026s">Imani.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1240.928s">I</a>  would support the motion to table this for only one week to take it back up again in a regular meeting next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1247.652s">Just</a>  to maintain the consistency, keep things moving along because that's what our newly minted election commission needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1253.915s">But</a>  in the future, I would support having more intentional process for approving commissioners for anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1262.32s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1264.441s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to table the paper for one week.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1267.663s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1271.225s">Is</a>  there any particular information that we'd like to request from the administration prior to us tabling this paper so that they're aware that there's something in particular that we're looking for whether it's just a resume a CV letter of support from the mayor, or whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1283.131s">I</a>  think, do we want the applicant to attend the meeting, or would a resume suffice do we want the applicant to attend with a resume.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1292.656s">First</a>  of all, we've done in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1294.458s">We've</a>  done in the past is we've seen, like I said, giving you example, Mr. Miller and I've known him. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1300.825s">Personally,</a>  I know his background, and I'm confident with what I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1305.691s">I</a>  also, I, other, other, other. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1312.237s">other</a>  participants resumes that to me, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1315.598s">I</a>  think just the resume, plus the added vetting of Sandy and her staff and the administration, I think that all I just wanna see is what their background is. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1326.923s">I</a>  think that to me, that's all I need. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1329.684s">So</a>  that's all I would ask for if someone wants to add to that, you're more than welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1333.025s">But</a>  right now, I think a simple, their resume just to get a better idea of what we think personally, I think it's important.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1342.578s">I'd</a>  just like to add a copy of the application as well then Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1350.394s">Sorry,</a>  my president. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1354.175s">Just,</a>  I would certainly support creating a more thorough system for how we approve appointments from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1361.7s">I</a>  just wouldn't feel comfortable treating this applicant differently than we've treated the applicants in the last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1367.964s">So</a>  just having a committee of the whole, I think that would mean we did three at once and then one separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1372.246s">I</a>  know that's no longer on the table, but I just wanted to put that out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1375.068s">I</a>  think we have to treat everyone the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1376.629s">I'm</a>  fine with tabling for one week. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1380.731s">So</a>  I won't debate that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1382.44s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight to table for one week and get a copy of the resume and application from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/c8iEJdtrmLE&t=1390.665s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll on your right.</p>
