1
00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:03,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to accept the minutes from the last meeting.

2
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:10,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,540
[SPEAKER_04]: I as well.

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Say aye in favor.

5
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:17,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

6
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:18,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

7
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:19,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

8
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:20,345
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

9
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:23,107
[SPEAKER_03]: So then, yeah, we can start now.

10
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:45,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the next thing on the agenda was, I was wondering if you wanted to have information on the website about you the same way that the Energy and Environment Committee has information on their site.

11
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me pull up what they have.

12
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:55,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.

13
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:58,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you see that?

14
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:01,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we can.

15
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:02,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

16
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:03,354
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.

17
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:07,797
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is just their, their webpage on, on go green Medford.

18
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:22,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, a little bit of information about them and then they get into the, sorry, the link to the agendas and the minutes and the recordings, and then they get into the bios and pictures of the members.

19
00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:29,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something you'd like to do for this group too?

20
00:01:38,503 --> 00:01:40,084
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you say, Lizette?

21
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:43,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I said that would be awesome.

22
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,133
[SPEAKER_06]: So by comparison, this is what the Climate Equity Council page looks like right now.

23
00:01:54,152 --> 00:02:00,176
[SPEAKER_06]: It just has the mission, the members, and then a link to the agendas and minutes.

24
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:09,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, we could, I would be fine with like putting my picture and just like, you know, Arabic Medford connector.

25
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:12,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't even know what I would put for bio.

26
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:17,126
[SPEAKER_04]: We can put the same thing that we did for the brochure.

27
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:23,030
[SPEAKER_04]: like a short thing of like our state mission.

28
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:24,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true.

29
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:35,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Brochures that never came out.

30
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:38,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have photos of the brochures too?

31
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:39,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like to include photos?

32
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:41,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we all have photos.

33
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,810
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

34
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Can someone here send those to me or should I reach out to Sophie?

35
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:59,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the pictures actually, Brenda, because I was the original sender to Penny when she was here.

36
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:02,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great.

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:14,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll send it first to our mission, our little paragraph that we did to everyone, see if they want to tweak it and I'll send everything to you.

38
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:17,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome, thank you.

39
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:18,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

40
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

41
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:37,326
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess then I think the only other thing in this administrative section here at the top of the meeting, I just want to remind folks that we had talked about our next meeting on June 24th being in person.

42
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:45,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you like that to be at City Hall or do you want to try to do a room in the library or something else?

43
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:47,944
[SPEAKER_04]: Room in the library would be nice.

44
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:51,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.

45
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:53,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially because there's AC there.

46
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:56,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

47
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:57,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

48
00:03:58,213 --> 00:04:01,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Technically City Hall has AC, but it's an old system.

49
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:03,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

50
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,560
[SPEAKER_04]: But their workspace is so beautiful.

51
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:09,383
[SPEAKER_04]: This should be taken advantage of too.

52
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:11,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

53
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:11,885
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds good.

54
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:16,903
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

55
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:31,514
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that was it for the administrative stuff.

56
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:36,878
[SPEAKER_06]: The next thing on the agenda was Medford Connects events.

57
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,562
[SPEAKER_06]: What upcoming events do you have?

58
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:51,899
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot actually send us a list of the ones that we were.

59
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Approve or not approve of doing.

60
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see where is it.

61
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:02,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So that we have the.

62
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Pride flag raising May 31st.

63
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:13,716
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the Circle the Square, June 15th.

64
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,717
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Hoops and Hope, June 9th.

65
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:26,679
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Juneteenth Flag Raising, the 18th of June.

66
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Multicultural Celebration, that's June 22nd.

67
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:35,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Skate, Mingle, and Dance Event, the 29th of June.

68
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:38,971
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a couple.

69
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:46,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Is circle the square June 5th, not the 15th?

70
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

71
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:49,254
[SPEAKER_04]: She wrote 15th.

72
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:54,515
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you see, if you know that it's the 5th, then maybe she didn't earn our email.

73
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:57,096
[SPEAKER_03]: My calendar says the 15th.

74
00:05:58,036 --> 00:05:58,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

75
00:05:58,856 --> 00:05:59,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

76
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:04,177
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

77
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:04,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

78
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,278
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the 15th.

79
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:05,698
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

80
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:06,198
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

81
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:17,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I was thinking in the back of my head, the farmer's market, which starts on June 6th.

82
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:21,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

83
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:25,770
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always on a Thursday, right?

84
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

85
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:27,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

86
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

87
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:34,993
[SPEAKER_06]: What is skate mingle and whatever the third thing was?

88
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:36,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And dance?

89
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:37,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And dance, yeah.

90
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:39,734
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good question.

91
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:44,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

92
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:55,340
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just, I believe it's, um, I believe it's the gay student alliance or a gay straight, I don't know, GSA something.

93
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what it was.

94
00:06:59,582 --> 00:06:59,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

95
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:01,322
[SPEAKER_06]: So, oh, it's another pride month event.

96
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:01,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

97
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:02,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

98
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:02,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

99
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:09,604
[SPEAKER_02]: At the La Conte skating rink, but I believe it's going to be roller skating.

100
00:07:09,624 --> 00:07:11,605
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they're going to put a roller floor down.

101
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:13,726
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very cool.

102
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:18,068
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are you going to?

103
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you guys going to be at all of these with?

104
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,853
[SPEAKER_06]: Materials about Medford connects or what?

105
00:07:24,953 --> 00:07:26,013
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the plan?

106
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:32,057
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I accepted all except for two, but I think so.

107
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the.

108
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:40,283
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal for us to all have information about what we do and like our own like.

109
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:44,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Goals like we had for the Haitian Flag Day, kind of the same thing.

110
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:47,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

111
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:48,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, cool.

112
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:58,325
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're not there, there'll be other liaisons and or connectors there.

113
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,745
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say we, I'm talking about the three of us who are on the call right now.

114
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:03,026
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

115
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:09,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm pretty much at all of the events except for Circle.

116
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:10,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Circle in the Square?

117
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:11,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

118
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't be there for that.

119
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:22,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to try to show up to all of them, but maybe I won't make all of them.

120
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:23,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

121
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:24,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

122
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:34,320
[SPEAKER_06]: If I drop off some Electrify Medford flyers with Sophie, can you pick them up there to have at these events?

123
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:35,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

124
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:41,062
[SPEAKER_03]: She usually brings like all the flyers and stuff from other organizations.

125
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:43,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure.

126
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:44,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

127
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:51,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say it might be good to throw some compost flyers in there too.

128
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:58,647
[SPEAKER_02]: That might really be good for the Hoops and Hope in June as well.

129
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:00,988
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds great.

130
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:14,694
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be at Circle the Square and we'll have some kind of carnival-like games that have a climate message to them for that.

131
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:16,735
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds cool.

132
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:17,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

133
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda, I have a question.

134
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:29,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, they'll probably be much better than our spin the wheel.

135
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:33,893
[SPEAKER_02]: We did our best.

136
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:35,854
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I can't wait to see it.

137
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:42,996
[SPEAKER_06]: These are just wooden games that people made, that this organization called Mass Energize made.

138
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:46,777
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're renting them from them for the day.

139
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:55,303
[SPEAKER_04]: For those curious on our agenda.

140
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:58,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we going to talk about the composting?

141
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:00,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes, yeah.

142
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:01,506
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

143
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:04,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll ask the question when we get to it.

144
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:09,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else under Medford connects events?

145
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:13,773
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that's it.

146
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually like.

147
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Sophie does like the month.

148
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:22,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Like plan, so then I think like by the end of like.

149
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:31,601
[SPEAKER_04]: two weeks before the end of June, we'll get another load of dates and stuff.

150
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:36,523
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a multicultural something or other that's going on in June.

151
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:37,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's June 22nd.

152
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:43,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know too much about that.

153
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:47,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

154
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:52,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there going to be a Hispanic event?

155
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, from what I heard, yes.

156
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:55,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

157
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,593
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know.

158
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:02,955
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that was usually around, like, October.

159
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:04,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, October.

160
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:04,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

161
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:08,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think Brazilian Portuguese, they might be August.

162
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:10,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Aren't they?

163
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:11,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're before us.

164
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:13,163
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all tentative.

165
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:14,004
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all tentative.

166
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:15,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kind of.

167
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:20,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Brenda was asking about events, so these are some things that are potentially coming up.

168
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:24,148
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have nothing set in stone at this point, but.

169
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are a couple of additional things that we have going on.

170
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

171
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:30,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

172
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:31,731
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll keep them in mind then.

173
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:32,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

174
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:34,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And.

175
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:50,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Are these is the multicultural celebration is that something that's being put on by the Office of Outreach and Prevention, or is that a different organization.

176
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:56,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure what the.

177
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:04,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure who is putting it on and or what it's to include.

178
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:09,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we'll probably get some more information about that in the next couple of weeks.

179
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:10,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know it's on our calendar.

180
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:15,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the thing is, don't you remember Stacey?

181
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:22,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Frances was the one who gave us the list of like all these dates and stuff.

182
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:26,569
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was going around saying what it was about, but obviously like it was too many

183
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:31,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can ask her the things that Francis were telling us about.

184
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:35,081
[SPEAKER_02]: That's those are primarily events.

185
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:38,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it roughly was the same.

186
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:42,329
[SPEAKER_04]: It roughly was the same ones because remember, I was taking the notes when we were doing.

187
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,073
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were on our meeting.

188
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:52,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it was roughly like, I think there was some extra events, but it was a majority was the events that we were already.

189
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,412
[SPEAKER_04]: That was in the email right now with Sophie.

190
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:57,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I think she knows a bit more about it as well.

191
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:07,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, there's 1 other thing that I know about on May 29th.

192
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:16,675
[SPEAKER_06]: there's the Black Health Series event focusing on asthma at the West Medford Community Center.

193
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:29,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll be there with a portable induction cooktop to talk to people about natural gas and its connection to asthma.

194
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:35,887
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll have a couple people from the Electrify Medford coaches who will be there too.

195
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:43,202
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be another Black Health, the final Black Health event will be in June.

196
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:48,387
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the date off hand, but I do have it in my calendar.

197
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:51,450
[SPEAKER_06]: What is that one focusing on?

198
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,912
[SPEAKER_02]: That's on men's health.

199
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:56,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus there's going to be a Juneteenth event.

200
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:59,978
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a flag raising at City Hall for Juneteenth.

201
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:00,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

202
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:18,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the Black Health series will wrap up sort of around Juneteenth, and it'll primarily be men's mental health, I think, mental health and men's health sort of thing.

203
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:25,306
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is June 26th, I believe.

204
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:35,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send you the flyer that had all the dates.

205
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:46,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It says that everything's being held at the library, but it turns out we've been doing it at the community center.

206
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:50,742
[SPEAKER_06]: The library's booked pretty solid.

207
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:54,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been trying to book some things there in the evenings, and there's just no space.

208
00:14:55,484 --> 00:15:00,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we kind of got booked ourselves for Wednesday for some events.

209
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,170
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

210
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:05,633
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hopping sort of place.

211
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:07,694
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice.

212
00:15:07,794 --> 00:15:08,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone wants to be there.

213
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:10,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

214
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:15,521
[SPEAKER_02]: As beautiful as the building is, people should be there and taking full advantage of it.

215
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I tell you, Malden doesn't have anything like that.

216
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:22,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be nice.

217
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:37,794
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, it would be really cool if we had our own building that we could do a ton of all of these events, you know, and not have to be doing it at the school.

218
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:44,417
[SPEAKER_04]: People go there, you know, like a community center that's like nearer to us, if that makes any sense.

219
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:45,498
[SPEAKER_04]: But just saying.

220
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:50,661
[SPEAKER_06]: This is one of the things I want to talk about when we get to the Electrify Medford topic.

221
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:57,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But anything else for the Medford Connects events?

222
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:03,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing that comes to mind.

223
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:04,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

224
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:05,447
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

225
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:12,253
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the next thing on the agenda is city actions.

226
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:19,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first thing I'm thinking of is top of mind is Electrify Medford.

227
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:27,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so we've done the first two coach trainings and there are three more over the next three weeks.

228
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:38,040
[SPEAKER_06]: We have 13 coaches who are actively participating in the trainings and there are, there are others who are, who are making up with other trainings by watching the recordings online.

229
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:42,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and three of our coaches are from the Haitian task force.

230
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:45,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

231
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:53,946
[SPEAKER_06]: But we would love to have people who speak other languages other than Haitian Creole in this as well.

232
00:16:54,026 --> 00:17:01,389
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, if you come across anyone who you think would be interested, please, please, please let them know.

233
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:10,312
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a basic web page on the city's website.

234
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:12,753
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have an introductory flyer.

235
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:22,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a Haitian Creole version of the flyer that Natasha translated for us just in time for Haitian Flag Day.

236
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:30,461
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Samia has just sent along a Portuguese translation to me today, so that's that's great.

237
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:35,343
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the process for this for the future?

238
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:38,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I submit that form to Sophie?

239
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:42,425
[SPEAKER_06]: That like breaks it down into the different languages?

240
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:42,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

241
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:50,204
[SPEAKER_03]: So Natasha had me do it this time, which is okay.

242
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:51,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

243
00:17:51,485 --> 00:18:00,807
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, if you can just like put all the text that needs to be translated into the Word document like so, like how you saw it.

244
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:05,589
[SPEAKER_03]: And will you with the different languages and then we'll, we'll work on it.

245
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working on the Arabic translations.

246
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,990
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working on the Spanish one still.

247
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:18,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, Brenda, anything that's 500 words or less we can translate.

248
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's great.

249
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:24,913
[SPEAKER_06]: And I should send it to you through Sophie, not directly to you.

250
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:26,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if you can.

251
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:32,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

252
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:48,976
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, so I think the way it will work is we'll have some flyers that are, you know, full flyers and in each language, and then we'll have one flyer that's English on one side and then little summaries and the different languages on the back.

253
00:18:54,039 --> 00:19:03,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving forward, I'll be adding some more detailed information on the Go Green Medford site with links to incentive programs and things like that.

254
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:10,516
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll be putting together some more flyers, as well as the questionnaire and the decarbonization roadmap.

255
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:12,859
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot more for me to do, more to come.

256
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:22,701
[SPEAKER_06]: But anything that you see that we're like putting out there, let me know at any point if you have any feedback on it.

257
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:31,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if I email it to you or you just see a flyer at an event or something, let me know, because always happy to change anything.

258
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:37,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Brenda, I think I sent like an email, because I had a quick question about like the QR codes.

259
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:43,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the both QR codes that you already have on the flyer, do they go to the same website?

260
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:45,246
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they don't.

261
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:52,690
[SPEAKER_06]: So one goes to, let's see, I can pull it up right here.

262
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:58,013
[SPEAKER_02]: One goes to signing up as a coach.

263
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:04,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one is talk to a coach if you have some questions.

264
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:08,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one goes to one of the websites.

265
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

266
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:17,556
[SPEAKER_06]: So the main one that has the box around it that we're trying to call people's attention to is here.

267
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:19,257
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the main site.

268
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,441
[SPEAKER_06]: And then people can click to sign up to talk to a coach.

269
00:20:26,262 --> 00:20:37,707
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the second one goes to the Go Green Medford site where I don't have a lot of additional information for this program on there right now.

270
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:52,033
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots of information that's been collected there over the years, but I do need to make some additional changes to this site for this in particular.

271
00:20:52,673 --> 00:20:55,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the third one goes to the coach signup form.

272
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:57,396
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

273
00:20:58,377 --> 00:20:59,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they all get translated?

274
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:05,820
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good question.

275
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,621
[SPEAKER_06]: So the two websites do.

276
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:14,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, I don't think the sign-up form does, which isn't very helpful.

277
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:16,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

278
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:23,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And I haven't found a way yet to translate the Smartsheet form

279
00:21:26,455 --> 00:21:38,144
[SPEAKER_06]: So I might have to add links at the bottom of the text area to different Smartsheet forms that are in the different languages.

280
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:43,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you get the same thing that the city website has that translates it to different languages?

281
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:46,010
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking for that.

282
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:54,977
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't look like that was available for Smartsheets, because this is a different app than what the two websites are.

283
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:57,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, makes sense.

284
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:05,880
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's possible there's something out there and I just have not found it yet.

285
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So I if I if I see something, Brenda, I'll send it to you.

286
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:11,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

287
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:12,364
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

288
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:32,898
[SPEAKER_06]: just jotting that down in the notes that we need, still need translations of those forms.

289
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

290
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:44,944
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting some fun props to draw people in when we're tabling.

291
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:55,811
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a dollhouse at the Haitian Flag Day event that was really fun, that drew a lot of kids in and their parents, so we could have conversations.

292
00:22:57,705 --> 00:23:04,808
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I mentioned, we'll have those carnival style square and for the Harvest Your Energy Festival in October.

293
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:12,310
[SPEAKER_06]: We could have them for every event, but we are renting them, not the dollhouse, but the carnival games.

294
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,011
[SPEAKER_06]: We're renting those for each event.

295
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:17,232
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're being careful which ones we're using them for.

296
00:23:17,252 --> 00:23:20,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't forget, Brenda, to modify the house.

297
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:28,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Alicia's husband is actually going to put some solar panels on it for me.

298
00:23:30,205 --> 00:23:36,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's going to 3D print a mini split and a heat pump water heater.

299
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:39,271
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

300
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:47,216
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to get a little cord so that we can plug in the little car.

301
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:55,347
[SPEAKER_06]: But that dollhouse is available for any time.

302
00:23:55,447 --> 00:24:01,329
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to use that dollhouse for any events, then you're welcome to borrow it.

303
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,512
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a hit.

304
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:15,594
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to have a kickoff event for Electrify Medford in early June, but I'm having a hard time finding a location.

305
00:24:15,614 --> 00:24:18,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it should be an evening or weekend.

306
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:28,245
[SPEAKER_06]: My first thought was the library, but that's not proving very easy to find a time for that.

307
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:38,771
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was thinking maybe something like the Willis Ave Community Center in South Medford or the West Medford Community Center.

308
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:43,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a big event or is it like a mini?

309
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:46,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I expect there would probably be 30 people.

310
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:56,636
[SPEAKER_04]: So a mini one, because I was suggesting I was going to suggest the front of the city hall because, you know, free space outside.

311
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:03,902
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but all depends on how many people you're estimating to go there.

312
00:25:04,543 --> 00:25:05,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's true.

313
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:09,547
[SPEAKER_06]: It does make it dependent on weather.

314
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:10,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm hmm.

315
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:11,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

316
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:13,851
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a good idea.

317
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:14,852
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even think of that.

318
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:16,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

319
00:25:18,075 --> 00:25:23,918
[SPEAKER_04]: we can do with like tarps, like, you know, like the cover.

320
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:24,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

321
00:25:24,698 --> 00:25:25,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

322
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we'll get people's attention.

323
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,422
[SPEAKER_04]: You have like green balloons, orange balloons, you know?

324
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:33,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

325
00:25:33,862 --> 00:25:34,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what is that?

326
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:40,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll be like, and you can have info of the compost thing because that thing was a success.

327
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:42,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

328
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:42,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

329
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:45,348
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, nice.

330
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:59,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, I was, I was really hoping to have something in like South Medford or West Medford, just because those are neighborhoods we're really trying to target with this pro with this program.

331
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:05,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and I, but I don't know a lot of areas, a lot of places where we could do it there.

332
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there parks near them?

333
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:11,294
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's Tufts park in South Medford.

334
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a good one.

335
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:14,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

336
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:21,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and there's Duggar Park that's right across the street from the West Medford Community Center.

337
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:26,114
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be that, you know, shoot for it.

338
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:31,018
[SPEAKER_02]: If an outdoor event is preferable, the park is right there.

339
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:43,286
[SPEAKER_02]: And that it's poor weather, you know, perhaps the community center, you know, would be the rain place if necessary.

340
00:26:43,346 --> 00:26:44,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And plus, you know, too, there's,

341
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:51,124
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if the community center is involved, is there bathrooms and stuff like that?

342
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:56,967
[SPEAKER_02]: If the center will be open, you know.

343
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:01,490
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's certainly a possibility.

344
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:09,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, Lisa Crossman would be the person to reach out, reach out to for that.

345
00:27:09,214 --> 00:27:11,195
[SPEAKER_02]: She's the ED over there.

346
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:19,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

347
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:24,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know much about the Willis Street.

348
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:31,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know it exists, but beyond that, I don't know much else about it.

349
00:27:31,704 --> 00:27:35,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's a Medford Housing Authority development.

350
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:43,786
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, we applied for a federal earmark to replace the community center because it's too small.

351
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:47,527
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not sure that it's large enough for something like this.

352
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:56,846
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly is, I mean, I don't know.

353
00:27:56,866 --> 00:28:00,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Liz, you might, Liz, I can't hear you.

354
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:04,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Lizette, you, perhaps you have a better idea.

355
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:08,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, would the community center be a big enough space?

356
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:14,409
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know you can fit 30 people in there if you're putting them in chairs and that sort of thing, but I don't know.

357
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:17,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it like displays?

358
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,130
[SPEAKER_04]: How close it is to the park?

359
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,430
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one question.

360
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:21,929
[SPEAKER_02]: How close is it?

361
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:24,533
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's on the backside.

362
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:25,254
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on.

363
00:28:25,294 --> 00:28:26,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you familiar with Mystic River Road?

364
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's right behind.

365
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:33,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right behind Mystic River Road is right behind the community center.

366
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so maybe like.

367
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:41,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess you could say, depending on the weather, that can be open.

368
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:44,870
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can have half and half, sort of.

369
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:49,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people need to go to the bathroom and stuff like that.

370
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:52,615
[SPEAKER_04]: They can take a little walk and go there.

371
00:28:53,495 --> 00:28:56,076
[SPEAKER_04]: And there'll be maybe some booths of information.

372
00:28:56,096 --> 00:29:00,079
[SPEAKER_04]: But majority of the stuff can be on the opposite side.

373
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:03,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, depending if the weather is good.

374
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

375
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:07,022
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's easy enough to scope it out.

376
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:08,223
[SPEAKER_02]: You know where Duggar Park is?

377
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:10,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Me personally.

378
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:11,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

379
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:12,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

380
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:18,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe on to be honest, if I see it, maybe I'll remember, but as you see it, you probably you probably will.

381
00:29:19,246 --> 00:29:19,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

382
00:29:21,163 --> 00:29:25,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, it's certainly an option, I think, certainly a viable option.

383
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:29,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks for those suggestions.

384
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:31,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why I hadn't thought of outdoors before.

385
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:34,356
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good idea.

386
00:29:34,376 --> 00:29:41,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're also working with the mayor's schedule to have her come to it as well.

387
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:44,145
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.

388
00:29:48,129 --> 00:29:51,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's it for Electrify Medford.

389
00:29:54,914 --> 00:30:01,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we go on, I just wanted to connect up with the coach recordings.

390
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:05,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, do we go to the

391
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it America Rewiring or something?

392
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that where the trainings are there?

393
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Rewiring America.

394
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:16,681
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

395
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:21,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was kind of on the impression they were Zoom meetings that were being recorded.

396
00:30:21,662 --> 00:30:24,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did connect to it.

397
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:26,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of saw it.

398
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:30,525
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wasn't really sure what I was looking at.

399
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:33,646
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't click on very much.

400
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:35,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just, you know.

401
00:30:35,907 --> 00:30:39,310
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're available online as those recordings.

402
00:30:41,032 --> 00:30:47,758
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know it can be hard for people sometimes to, you know, take the time to sit down to do it if they don't have a fixed time.

403
00:30:47,858 --> 00:30:54,745
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why we're doing the zoom meetings where we're really just getting on together and watching those recordings together.

404
00:30:55,305 --> 00:30:55,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

405
00:30:57,087 --> 00:31:01,997
[SPEAKER_06]: But Edith from Abode is actually going to be joining us each time.

406
00:31:02,758 --> 00:31:07,627
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the last half hour of the Zoom meeting, she'll just be there to answer people's questions.

407
00:31:08,812 --> 00:31:17,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's quizzes and stuff, or there's some sort of test at the end of the four trainings that folks, do folks have to pass those?

408
00:31:18,362 --> 00:31:25,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so each of the sections, there are four sections, and each section has a quiz that's like 10 questions long or so.

409
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:31,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and you do need to pass it, but you can retake it multiple times if you

410
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:44,422
[SPEAKER_06]: if you don't do it the first time, it's really just a way for them to highlight sort of the most important topics that they're trying to get across in the recordings.

411
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:45,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

412
00:31:46,483 --> 00:31:46,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

413
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:47,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

414
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, composting.

415
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:10,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Lizette, did I hear that you went to the, uh, that you went to the garbage to garden compost event?

416
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:14,429
[SPEAKER_04]: So luckily I passed by it without even realizing it.

417
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:23,391
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my sister went crazy and I don't know if she like signed up for it, but she needs to get a compost thingy.

418
00:32:24,752 --> 00:32:28,533
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just curious to know where those are at the city hall.

419
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:34,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, so did you stop and get a bin?

420
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:41,428
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I couldn't because it wasn't, I think it was, correct me if I'm wrong, the same day as the event?

421
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:46,075
[SPEAKER_04]: The Haitian Flag Day event?

422
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:46,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I crazy?

423
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:48,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was.

424
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:49,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

425
00:32:51,938 --> 00:33:08,946
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah um so yeah so your sister can sign up anytime oh no she signed up she just oh she already did okay yeah that's what i'm saying she needs to get the um composting bin but that's where like she doesn't know where to go so i would like to know where that goes so then i can tell people

426
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:12,568
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

427
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:29,560
[SPEAKER_06]: My impression was that they were doing that one big distribution event, and then they were going to drop the rest of them off at people's homes, like, you know, whenever it is that they've signed up for.

428
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,462
[SPEAKER_06]: So if she signed up for it to start July 1st, it would be before them.

429
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:40,207
[SPEAKER_04]: She texted me and she said, I signed up for them, but I don't know if I'll get one.

430
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:40,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

431
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:47,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I can double check that with Alicia to make sure what's going to happen.

432
00:33:47,353 --> 00:33:52,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't think they were planning on doing another big bin distribution event.

433
00:33:52,975 --> 00:33:56,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they were just going to drop them off at people's homes after that.

434
00:33:56,797 --> 00:33:57,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

435
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:07,121
[SPEAKER_04]: If anything, where, like, where at the City Hall can you go to ask or to sign up?

436
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:12,637
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be my office, yeah.

437
00:34:13,157 --> 00:34:14,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Planning Development and Sustainability room 308.

438
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,923
[SPEAKER_06]: But also you could just go online to medfordcompost.com and that would have information there that we would have.

439
00:34:24,024 --> 00:34:24,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

440
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:29,087
[SPEAKER_04]: That was perfect.

441
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:30,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

442
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:34,730
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a little over 3,000 people signed up for composting now.

443
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

444
00:34:36,151 --> 00:34:37,212
[SPEAKER_06]: So there was a big jump.

445
00:34:38,113 --> 00:34:38,693
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

446
00:34:40,002 --> 00:34:44,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that almost doubled since last month when we met, hasn't it?

447
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:46,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's more than doubled, hasn't it?

448
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:47,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was about 2,000.

449
00:34:48,729 --> 00:34:50,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about 2,000 before.

450
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought it was less than that.

451
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:55,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there was like 1,000 who signed up to start doing it now.

452
00:34:56,415 --> 00:34:59,157
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there were 1,200 who signed up to start in July.

453
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:03,500
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's like 2,000 roughly total.

454
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've had another 1,000 people sign up since then.

455
00:35:06,342 --> 00:35:06,943
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

456
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:15,088
[SPEAKER_06]: But the goal is for us to have 4,000 people signed up by July 1st.

457
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:20,391
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're still trying to get the word out.

458
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:32,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's everything for the composting.

459
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:57,723
[SPEAKER_06]: For the Andrews and McGlynn heating and cooling system updates, we presented to the school committee on April 29th about the plans for the heating systems for those schools and the repairs in the other three schools that are kind of being lumped in together in the contracting process.

460
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:05,922
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were happy for us to continue with those plans.

461
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:17,828
[SPEAKER_06]: At the same meeting, the school committee passed a resolution banning the purchase of fossil fuel equipment for the schools unless the school committee authorized it.

462
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:24,491
[SPEAKER_06]: So the city or facility staff couldn't just replace

463
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:31,837
[SPEAKER_06]: equipment that had broken down with new fossil fuel equipment, they'd have to go to the school committee first and get approval.

464
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:38,720
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really good.

465
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:46,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely, yeah.

466
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:50,825
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, oh, brand new thing here.

467
00:36:51,565 --> 00:36:52,826
[SPEAKER_06]: We applied for

468
00:36:54,297 --> 00:37:04,385
[SPEAKER_06]: technical assistance to put together a decarbonization roadmap for city-owned buildings, where we kind of outline, this is all the equipment in our buildings.

469
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:07,608
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the expected lifetimes of them.

470
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:19,017
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what we would replace it with when it gets close to the end of its lifetime, and just have a plan set out for the next 30 years.

471
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:28,318
[SPEAKER_06]: And we applied for technical assistance from the Department of Energy Resources for that.

472
00:37:28,518 --> 00:37:30,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got that award.

473
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:41,607
[SPEAKER_06]: So over the next couple of months, we're going to be working with their contractor that they've hired to help us to put together that roadmap.

474
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:51,875
[SPEAKER_06]: So I need to be collecting lots of information about our buildings over the next couple of months to get that done.

475
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:57,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So Brenda, how does the financing for that work?

476
00:37:57,377 --> 00:38:05,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, okay, so we're looking at, you're looking at putting out a 30-year plan for lifespan.

477
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:22,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean that the city begins now to start thinking about that and tucking money away, or is that a matter of grants from the state and our federal?

478
00:38:23,564 --> 00:38:30,013
[SPEAKER_02]: To accomplish anything, you know, when when the lifespan of a building or whatever.

479
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:47,053
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, so the idea is that this plan means that we don't, we aren't stuck in situations like we are now where it's an emergency and we have to do it as quickly as possible because we're already, you know, we've already lost cooling in some places, right?

480
00:38:48,673 --> 00:39:01,296
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea is that with this plan outlined, we can say, okay, in, you know, three years, we're going to need to replace this, you know, water heater.

481
00:39:02,016 --> 00:39:06,700
[SPEAKER_06]: No, or we're going to need to replace water heaters across all of these schools.

482
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's apply for a grant in order to do that.

483
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:11,783
[SPEAKER_06]: And it allows us to take, you know, to plan it out.

484
00:39:12,544 --> 00:39:14,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of these grant timeframes can be really long.

485
00:39:15,946 --> 00:39:19,469
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it makes it really difficult in an emergency situation.

486
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:23,092
[SPEAKER_06]: So, having a plan like that makes it much easier to go out for those grants.

487
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:24,045
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

488
00:39:24,265 --> 00:39:47,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't know if, you know, you know, you know, we're having the foresight to look, look ahead and, you know, are the dollars and cents sort of, you know, are the savings accounts, you know, being replenished and such in order to accomplish those goals, you know, three, three years down the road and that sort of thing.

489
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:47,942
[SPEAKER_02]: But I get it.

490
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:50,103
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be grants and that sort of thing.

491
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:52,104
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's good.

492
00:39:52,585 --> 00:39:55,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, that's the goal is to be able to plan for that, right?

493
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:59,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether it's or city funds, we, we definitely don't have the funds for all of that now.

494
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, well, that's what I figured.

495
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:05,073
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, I think it's, I think it's great to have a plan in place.

496
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:08,835
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, so I just kind of wondered, I mean, you know, a plan is great.

497
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:14,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we, you know, we shouldn't, we shouldn't get caught, you know.

498
00:40:17,322 --> 00:40:22,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say what I would normally say, but it won't catch us off guard.

499
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:23,605
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

500
00:40:24,366 --> 00:40:24,946
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

501
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:28,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've been planning for it, we saw it, we planned for it.

502
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:35,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the plan is here, how are we going to get it in action?

503
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:40,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely.

504
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:56,091
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we have a lot just the next few years with the HVAC upgrades in the in the couple in Andrews and McGlynn repairs and three other schools and then the high school.

505
00:40:57,671 --> 00:41:03,536
[SPEAKER_06]: either complete replacement or giant retrofit situation coming up on us, so.

506
00:41:03,856 --> 00:41:08,800
[SPEAKER_04]: No way, they're thinking of rebuilding it?

507
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:15,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Complete replacement sounds like the way to go there, gut and rejail.

508
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, so many memories.

509
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:20,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but have you seen that place?

510
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:26,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know, it's shaped like a jail, it looks like a jail, but it's the best place I've ever been.

511
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:30,475
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the concrete steps are crumbling.

512
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:33,056
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

513
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:34,496
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of bad.

514
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:35,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

515
00:41:36,136 --> 00:41:37,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's what we'll be taking to account.

516
00:41:37,937 --> 00:41:47,219
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Massachusetts School Building Association is going to be giving us funding for part of the cost of that.

517
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:56,242
[SPEAKER_06]: And they require that you look at replacement and a retrofit and see which one makes the most sense.

518
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Will they come up with a plan, Brenda?

519
00:42:01,238 --> 00:42:04,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Like showing what they will do, like architectural-wise?

520
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:05,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Just curious.

521
00:42:05,662 --> 00:42:06,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, we will.

522
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:06,822
[SPEAKER_06]: We will.

523
00:42:06,842 --> 00:42:10,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll come up with the plans and we'll submit them to the MSBA.

524
00:42:10,605 --> 00:42:13,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

525
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:15,549
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

526
00:42:16,189 --> 00:42:22,474
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are arguments for both sides because the argument for keeping the existing building is, from my perspective,

527
00:42:23,937 --> 00:42:29,219
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so much carbon emissions that went into the building of that building.

528
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:37,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you build a new one, you're putting all of that in again a second time.

529
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:42,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's like half of a building's emissions over its lifetime is just in the building of it.

530
00:42:44,585 --> 00:42:45,205
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

531
00:42:47,226 --> 00:42:53,488
[SPEAKER_03]: So you think it's better that they just work with what's already there?

532
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,831
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to look at it and see what it would take.

533
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:08,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if it's so far gone that you would need to replace a lot of it anyway, it might not make sense to do that.

534
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:10,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

535
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:15,635
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's still in decent condition, then it might make sense to retrofit it.

536
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:16,935
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.

537
00:43:17,075 --> 00:43:17,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

538
00:43:17,646 --> 00:43:30,790
[SPEAKER_04]: In all honesty, I went there the other day and I feel like there needs to be so many updates to that building that it might as well be like gutted, to be honest.

539
00:43:31,631 --> 00:43:33,431
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm hearing from a lot of people.

540
00:43:33,451 --> 00:43:38,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Keeping an open mind, but a lot of people think that, yeah.

541
00:43:39,148 --> 00:43:44,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, like I remember being there and it was summertime and we were all dying of heat.

542
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:49,593
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter how much you open the windows or anything, it was so hot.

543
00:43:50,013 --> 00:43:52,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Then in the wintertime, it was cold like it wouldn't.

544
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:57,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really almost criminal, like what they put those kids through.

545
00:44:00,278 --> 00:44:00,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

546
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And I should know I was, you know, I wasn't there not too long ago, you know.

547
00:44:07,822 --> 00:44:08,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Every summer.

548
00:44:10,632 --> 00:44:14,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there in 2000 till 2011.

549
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:20,954
[SPEAKER_04]: And that thing, it's still, it's still the same, a little bit like, I don't know, everything deteriorates.

550
00:44:21,014 --> 00:44:29,835
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, yeah, I mean, it would be a sin though, because they just did the science labs like a few years ago.

551
00:44:30,355 --> 00:44:32,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Brenda, they like remodeled it.

552
00:44:33,836 --> 00:44:35,276
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, that was like 2018.

553
00:44:35,336 --> 00:44:35,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

554
00:44:42,274 --> 00:44:44,816
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but I think that needs to be over.

555
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:45,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, 2015.

556
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:45,976
2015.

557
00:44:46,036 --> 00:44:54,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a few years after I graduated.

558
00:44:54,882 --> 00:44:55,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.

559
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:56,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost 10 years ago now.

560
00:44:56,483 --> 00:44:57,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

561
00:44:58,144 --> 00:44:59,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Brenda, please don't say that.

562
00:45:00,285 --> 00:45:02,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know when the school was rebuilt?

563
00:45:04,148 --> 00:45:04,828
[SPEAKER_02]: The high school?

564
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't.

565
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,130
[SPEAKER_02]: 1960 something?

566
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:08,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

567
00:45:08,451 --> 00:45:08,811
[SPEAKER_02]: 1960 something?

568
00:45:13,138 --> 00:45:24,547
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it was after that, because it wasn't that it wasn't that old when I 19, I mean, 1894 between 1894 to 18.

569
00:45:24,647 --> 00:45:27,950
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not not the old was the rear wing.

570
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:33,675
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm talking about the new high school on Winter Street, not the not the high school that was on.

571
00:45:33,695 --> 00:45:37,618
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it on Forest Street?

572
00:45:42,655 --> 00:45:44,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, now, isn't it?

573
00:45:44,316 --> 00:45:48,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes, near the theater, right?

574
00:45:48,257 --> 00:45:49,797
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the old one used to be.

575
00:45:49,857 --> 00:45:50,697
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

576
00:45:50,737 --> 00:45:55,098
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the old now that might have been built in 18,000 or something.

577
00:45:55,698 --> 00:45:56,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

578
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:57,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one?

579
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:59,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about the one on Winthrop Street.

580
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,940
[SPEAKER_02]: When was that built?

581
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:04,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking in the 70s.

582
00:46:05,354 --> 00:46:08,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're talking about the one that Charbel and I went?

583
00:46:08,737 --> 00:46:10,078
[SPEAKER_02]: The current high school.

584
00:46:10,218 --> 00:46:12,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was in the 70s, I think.

585
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,760
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm thinking.

586
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 1970s.

587
00:46:15,642 --> 00:46:21,726
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that old, but even at that time, it was starting to, you know.

588
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:23,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

589
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Just think about all the stuff that.

590
00:46:26,749 --> 00:46:30,252
[SPEAKER_03]: In 30 years, there should be some kind of

591
00:46:32,265 --> 00:46:33,625
[SPEAKER_03]: refurbishing going on.

592
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:35,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Refurbish.

593
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:37,926
[SPEAKER_04]: And up to the plumbing.

594
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:41,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And ongoing maintenance going on.

595
00:46:41,487 --> 00:46:42,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

596
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:43,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

597
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:44,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

598
00:46:45,747 --> 00:46:47,668
[SPEAKER_04]: That must cost a lot to run that place.

599
00:46:48,668 --> 00:47:01,110
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because it's like it's really embarrassing because like if you look at the other cities, beautiful high schools with like brand new facilities and stuff every every couple of years.

600
00:47:02,932 --> 00:47:05,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Well it's kind of like the Andrews and the McGlynn.

601
00:47:06,077 --> 00:47:09,462
[SPEAKER_04]: How they totally made that brand spanking new.

602
00:47:09,582 --> 00:47:11,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was top notch.

603
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:13,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

604
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,952
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be something like that.

605
00:47:20,707 --> 00:47:26,569
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the only other thing that I had here was the Energy and Environment Committee update.

606
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:29,670
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an exciting one, actually.

607
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:34,672
[SPEAKER_06]: So their May 6th meeting, Senator Barrett attended.

608
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:41,234
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the head of the Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy Committee.

609
00:47:41,254 --> 00:47:47,777
[SPEAKER_06]: And he talked about the omnibus climate bill that his committee is working on this year.

610
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:56,055
[SPEAKER_06]: And it should be finalized by the end of July, has to be finalized by the end of July if it's gonna be passed this year.

611
00:47:56,075 --> 00:48:00,558
[SPEAKER_06]: It has like 50 to 60 different parts to it.

612
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:06,402
[SPEAKER_06]: But he mostly talked about siting and permitting of energy infrastructure.

613
00:48:06,422 --> 00:48:13,988
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the parts of this bill would create one comprehensive permit

614
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:19,730
[SPEAKER_06]: that municipalities would use.

615
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:26,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of having multiple permits for synergy infrastructure, there would just be one comprehensive permit that covered everything.

616
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:38,022
[SPEAKER_06]: And this would be for things like substations and transmission lines and things like that.

617
00:48:39,864 --> 00:48:47,506
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the city did not have the permit or approves it with conditions, it could be appealed to a statewide siting.

618
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:52,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they would consider it and their decision would be contained.

619
00:48:54,849 --> 00:49:01,771
[SPEAKER_06]: And then folks could, people could lose decisions, but by appealing that to the state Supreme Judicial Court.

620
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:17,495
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was interesting because I think energy infrastructure siting is something that you get arguments against from a couple different sides, right?

621
00:49:17,515 --> 00:49:23,581
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got the people who are saying like often these things are cited in environmental justice communities.

622
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:30,502
[SPEAKER_06]: and they shouldn't be, and there needs to be more consideration around that.

623
00:49:31,323 --> 00:49:42,351
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's the people who have more money and are saying, we don't want this in our backyards, which is why it gets put into environmental justice communities.

624
00:49:42,871 --> 00:49:47,615
[SPEAKER_06]: And so this is kind of trying to kind of go down that middle path.

625
00:49:55,252 --> 00:50:00,715
[SPEAKER_06]: He also talked very briefly about a few other parts of the bill.

626
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:07,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, residents have a right to natural gas.

627
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:15,242
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is no natural gas hookup to their house, the utility is required to connect to it.

628
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:23,506
[SPEAKER_06]: This part of the bill would make it not a right to natural gas, but a right to heat.

629
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:31,043
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not saying how your heat has to be served, but you have to have a way of heating your house.

630
00:50:31,923 --> 00:50:37,567
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that way is with electricity, then there's not that right to get natural gas.

631
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:49,033
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also part of it is a ban on competitive electricity suppliers for individuals.

632
00:50:49,754 --> 00:50:51,755
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's sort of the door to door like,

633
00:50:52,944 --> 00:51:01,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Companies that are kind of predatory and signing people up for contracts that are more expensive than what the utility offers.

634
00:51:04,372 --> 00:51:09,616
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that I'm really looking forward to is that ban because we had someone come into the office a couple weeks ago.

635
00:51:11,175 --> 00:51:16,077
[SPEAKER_06]: who didn't know that she'd been signed up for one of these competitive suppliers.

636
00:51:16,837 --> 00:51:22,920
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was $0.05 per kilowatt more expensive than Medford's aggregation.

637
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

638
00:51:26,662 --> 00:51:31,964
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like... Yeah, it was a difference between like $0.13 and $0.18.

639
00:51:32,004 --> 00:51:32,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

640
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,291
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of money in the long run.

641
00:51:42,713 --> 00:51:43,574
[SPEAKER_06]: And she didn't know about it.

642
00:51:43,594 --> 00:51:52,403
[SPEAKER_06]: I assume someone must have just come to her door and was talking to her and asked to see her utility bill and got her account number and signed her up that way.

643
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:55,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

644
00:51:58,709 --> 00:51:59,590
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm looking forward to that.

645
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:13,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Another thing he talked about is this bill, one of the aspects of it would change the requirement for National Grid to purchase electric supply every six months.

646
00:52:13,081 --> 00:52:24,090
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the reasons that Medford's aggregation is lower than the utilities rate most of the time is because the utilities are required to purchase electricity at six month intervals.

647
00:52:24,611 --> 00:52:26,932
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're locked into the times when they buy it.

648
00:52:27,673 --> 00:52:33,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why there are those fluctuations because they have to buy during different seasons and they have to buy every six months.

649
00:52:34,642 --> 00:52:44,856
[SPEAKER_06]: So this would allow them to do the same thing that Medford's aggregation is doing basically, which is time when their electricity is for times when the market's lower.

650
00:52:45,898 --> 00:52:49,099
[SPEAKER_06]: lock it in for longer periods of time, things like that.

651
00:52:51,739 --> 00:53:06,862
[SPEAKER_06]: That might make Medford's aggregation a little bit less competitive with National Grid's basic rate, but it would also mean that National Grid's regular rate would be a cheaper option for everybody too.

652
00:53:07,702 --> 00:53:09,062
[SPEAKER_06]: It would save people money in the end.

653
00:53:10,242 --> 00:53:14,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that mean that National Grid would have a monopoly on

654
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:20,649
[SPEAKER_03]: electric?

655
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:22,751
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they don't technically.

656
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:25,793
[SPEAKER_06]: So technically, utilities are a regulated monopoly.

657
00:53:27,775 --> 00:53:33,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because the distribution systems that they manage, you can only have one, basically.

658
00:53:33,281 --> 00:53:36,123
[SPEAKER_06]: That's only allowed one in each town.

659
00:53:39,443 --> 00:53:42,525
[SPEAKER_06]: which is why we only have national grid here in Medford.

660
00:53:42,545 --> 00:53:45,768
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have lots of utilities vying for each other.

661
00:53:45,788 --> 00:53:47,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

662
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:58,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, because they can just charge however they want, how much they want in the end.

663
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:01,159
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's already a thing, so never mind.

664
00:54:02,255 --> 00:54:09,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they have oversight from the Department of Public Utilities, so they have to submit their rate plans and everything and get approval through that.

665
00:54:09,536 --> 00:54:15,417
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

666
00:54:15,557 --> 00:54:26,919
[SPEAKER_06]: And then another aspect of the bill that he talked about was a bottle bill that will increase deposits to 10 cents and will cover more bottles.

667
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:31,260
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll cover like the little nips that you see thrown on the ground everywhere too.

668
00:54:38,273 --> 00:54:40,335
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that was most of what he talked about.

669
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:42,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was really interesting.

670
00:54:43,298 --> 00:54:59,875
[SPEAKER_06]: I think mainly the reason that he was coming to the Energy Committee was because he was doing sort of a roadshow going to municipalities, talking to them about the siting and permitting aspect of it to get feedback on that.

671
00:55:06,062 --> 00:55:09,584
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's it for my information.

672
00:55:09,644 --> 00:55:16,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Was there anything about any of that that you had questions about or wanted to talk about?

673
00:55:16,227 --> 00:55:25,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing for me.

674
00:55:27,913 --> 00:55:30,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I'm all set.

675
00:55:30,454 --> 00:55:33,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just kind of confused a little bit about the

676
00:55:34,672 --> 00:55:35,773
[SPEAKER_03]: national grid thing.

677
00:55:36,674 --> 00:55:41,698
[SPEAKER_03]: If you wouldn't mind just like, I don't know, explaining one more time.

678
00:55:42,258 --> 00:55:42,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure.

679
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:43,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

680
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:52,606
[SPEAKER_06]: So national grid, um, so they're a regulated monopoly for the distribution of, um, energy of electricity.

681
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and, and gas where they, where they do gas as well.

682
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:58,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Um,

683
00:56:00,345 --> 00:56:06,191
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's because they manage all of the lines and the pipes and stuff that go to your house.

684
00:56:07,132 --> 00:56:11,517
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't actually create any electricity themselves.

685
00:56:11,537 --> 00:56:13,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they don't do any supply themselves.

686
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,804
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just buying it on the open market and having it on to customers.

687
00:56:18,905 --> 00:56:19,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

688
00:56:20,235 --> 00:56:21,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

689
00:56:21,876 --> 00:56:38,842
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Department of Public Utilities, and they had been required to purchase their electricity at specific times so that the companies that did generate the electricity would know when to expect these purchases to happen.

690
00:56:42,585 --> 00:56:52,317
[SPEAKER_06]: But, so that made it more reliable for those companies, but it also meant that, you know, it did increase the prices for, for customers too.

691
00:56:52,337 --> 00:56:55,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

692
00:56:57,203 --> 00:56:57,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

693
00:56:58,986 --> 00:56:59,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

694
00:56:59,466 --> 00:56:59,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

695
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:16,012
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're interested, for a future meeting, we can talk about the electric grid and, like, I don't know, the local distribution and the ISO New England and how that's managed and Department of Public Utilities and all of that.

696
00:57:17,093 --> 00:57:21,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put that on the agenda for next meeting.

697
00:57:22,778 --> 00:57:23,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

698
00:57:23,438 --> 00:57:28,903
[SPEAKER_03]: You made a spreadsheet, correct, to put, like, the topics?

699
00:57:34,086 --> 00:57:34,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, bless you.

700
00:57:35,788 --> 00:57:38,730
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

701
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:44,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so that's our next agenda item, actually, is our priorities.

702
00:57:44,575 --> 00:57:49,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question, Brenda.

703
00:57:49,219 --> 00:58:00,429
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's something like a certain, I mean, when you send us the minutes for like, you know, our meetings, if things are misspelled, is that okay?

704
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:01,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Or can I tell you what?

705
00:58:02,398 --> 00:58:06,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, please tell me I'll correct them before we actually put it up online.

706
00:58:06,921 --> 00:58:27,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it sounds dumb, but it's just like it's supposed to say they just put, but they put, you put the T-B-E-Y where it says, um, underneath number two city communications, uh, underneath where it says tax bills, it says there's also Tufts daily.

707
00:58:27,872 --> 00:58:28,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

708
00:58:29,013 --> 00:58:31,054
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you can see it.

709
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:35,546
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pulling it up in front of me right now.

710
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:37,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good one.

711
00:58:37,607 --> 00:58:37,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

712
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:40,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, thank you.

713
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:42,410
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.

714
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:49,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was gonna say, if you need anything for the event for the Electrify Medford, let us know.

715
00:58:54,116 --> 00:59:00,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything for in terms of translation or... Translation or I think help as well too, I mean,

716
00:59:01,492 --> 00:59:03,053
[SPEAKER_04]: we're not opposed to helping.

717
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:07,457
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's within the scope of it, obviously, which I think it is, so.

718
00:59:10,299 --> 00:59:11,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's awesome.

719
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:22,008
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think part of it is definitely making sure to get you the flyers for Electrify Medford and having you be comfortable talking about it with people.

720
00:59:24,446 --> 00:59:38,618
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you feel you need more, sort of more training on any of that, let me know and we can follow up in future meetings with more info.

721
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:39,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

722
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:43,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we can do that for a meeting, no?

723
00:59:43,902 --> 00:59:44,622
[SPEAKER_04]: With all of us.

724
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:48,786
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're on the same page of what we can, what, you know,

725
00:59:50,118 --> 00:59:53,322
[SPEAKER_04]: We say when we talk to people and things like that.

726
00:59:53,743 --> 00:59:55,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.

727
00:59:55,104 --> 01:00:07,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you've heard me talk about it so many times that you could give the summary in your sleep, but.

728
01:00:10,882 --> 01:00:19,029
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some things that I get asked that are a little weird sometimes, so it's nice to have a little preparation for that.

729
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:28,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody this weekend started talking to me about how he doesn't trust anything the government does, and that's why he didn't get his COVID shot.

730
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,341
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't breathe.

731
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:32,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

732
01:00:33,342 --> 01:00:36,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, OK, that's a little bit out of my purview here.

733
01:00:38,284 --> 01:00:45,429
[SPEAKER_04]: You imagine how many questions the mayor would get or, like, any other, like, political they're like about those questions that I'm really just like.

734
01:00:46,189 --> 01:00:47,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know how to answer that.

735
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:49,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's hard.

736
01:00:51,793 --> 01:00:52,854
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to deal with that.

737
01:00:52,874 --> 01:00:54,035
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.

738
01:00:58,038 --> 01:01:07,124
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, what I was thinking of in terms of these priorities is not just necessarily like, just topics to talk about at future meetings, but if there are, um.

739
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:26,195
[SPEAKER_06]: projects that you want to work on or you want to be involved in or consulted on or anything like that, then you'd want to have them listed in here so that you can decide what to focus on as a group.

740
01:01:28,516 --> 01:01:36,602
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that I was thinking of was just keeping in mind sort of the mission of the Climate Equity Council.

741
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:51,692
[SPEAKER_06]: to advise the city on implementation of the Climate Action Plan with a focus on representing the interests of previously underrepresented groups based primarily on members' lived experiences and perspectives they've garnered from their communities.

742
01:01:51,732 --> 01:02:03,037
[SPEAKER_06]: The council will give feedback on proposed city actions, including neighborhood-specific projects, building and energy projects, stormwater projects, public health projects, and transportation projects.

743
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:18,533
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we've talked about all of those areas here with multiple different things that are going on with each of them.

744
01:02:21,775 --> 01:02:32,362
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there are ones you're particularly interested in or you want to make sure that you're continuing on moving forward, I want to try to get it in here.

745
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:54,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's like, is there a list of like, ongoing projects that like mentioned, like, that you, that would be, you know, good for us to electrify Medford is, is one of those projects, right?

746
01:02:55,368 --> 01:02:55,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

747
01:02:55,988 --> 01:03:03,654
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I'm just, I'm dropping some, a few things in here that we've talked about in previous meetings that,

748
01:03:07,496 --> 01:03:14,818
[SPEAKER_06]: seemed like they were things he might want to focus on.

749
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:25,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of these things you might say it's too broad.

750
01:03:27,465 --> 01:03:37,995
[SPEAKER_06]: It's too broad or, well, like, yes, there are topics in this area that I'm interested in, but let's focus in on particular things, right?

751
01:03:38,736 --> 01:03:41,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Or actually, that's not the way I see this committee going.

752
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:44,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's focus in on something more hands-on or whatever.

753
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:14,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so just a few things that I just dropped in here.

754
01:04:15,193 --> 01:04:31,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Electrify Medford, composting, stormwater education, school outreach, city policy, state federal policy, city building upgrades, city transportation projects.

755
01:04:33,792 --> 01:04:48,037
[SPEAKER_06]: These are things that are the top of my mind, but there could be other things that other departments work on that you might be interested in that I haven't been, you know, directly involved in that I could reach out to people and pull them into.

756
01:05:14,413 --> 01:05:16,514
[SPEAKER_04]: We took out of our list to the.

757
01:05:20,597 --> 01:05:21,817
[SPEAKER_04]: The electric cars, right?

758
01:05:27,581 --> 01:05:28,601
[SPEAKER_06]: We can add it back in though.

759
01:05:28,641 --> 01:05:30,182
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all open.

760
01:05:33,484 --> 01:05:35,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Open discussion electric.

761
01:05:35,425 --> 01:05:38,147
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we, I don't know if.

762
01:05:39,107 --> 01:05:41,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember correctly that we were going to update where, like.

763
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:46,413
[SPEAKER_04]: there was going to be more spots to be able to charge your car.

764
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:56,341
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you?

765
01:05:56,421 --> 01:05:56,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

766
01:05:56,881 --> 01:05:58,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you thinking charging stations?

767
01:05:58,562 --> 01:06:04,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I remember you showed us like where there was already and when there was going to be.

768
01:06:04,267 --> 01:06:07,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just curious to know if like they put them in.

769
01:06:08,933 --> 01:06:10,113
[SPEAKER_04]: where they were planning to.

770
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:13,194
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got most of them in now.

771
01:06:13,234 --> 01:06:20,616
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still waiting on National Grid to connect the station that's installed at West Medford parking lot.

772
01:06:21,876 --> 01:06:30,859
[SPEAKER_06]: A charger is being installed at the DPW this week and at the police station next week.

773
01:06:32,139 --> 01:06:35,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Although the police station one is just for their use, it's not open to the public.

774
01:06:38,497 --> 01:06:43,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't also, Brenda, the station for the bikes?

775
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:49,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Blue bike stations.

776
01:07:01,215 --> 01:07:07,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you thinking of giving feedback on where the station should be located in the future?

777
01:07:09,118 --> 01:07:33,683
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah i think that as well as like um where maybe like do you guys have it in your in the electrified medford like links to where like the maps are that shows where those things are what where is it where is it under because let me see

778
01:07:34,603 --> 01:07:39,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me stop screen sharing while I look for this.

779
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,907
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the Go Green Medford website.

780
01:07:42,527 --> 01:07:42,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

781
01:07:43,908 --> 01:07:45,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have any at the schools?

782
01:07:46,509 --> 01:07:47,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

783
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:49,491
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one at the high school.

784
01:07:49,511 --> 01:07:50,511
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

785
01:07:51,672 --> 01:07:54,033
[SPEAKER_06]: There is one at the Brooks.

786
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:55,494
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one at the Missituk.

787
01:07:55,634 --> 01:07:56,915
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one at the Roberts.

788
01:07:59,116 --> 01:07:59,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

789
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:04,818
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one at Hormel Stadium, so it's not technically at McLean or Andrews, but it's nearby.

790
01:08:04,838 --> 01:08:06,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, close enough.

791
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:09,760
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good.

792
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:17,324
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually had some, uh, some teachers, well, a teacher, I've had two teachers reach out to me.

793
01:08:17,424 --> 01:08:19,985
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them was interested in getting an electric vehicle.

794
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:24,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of them said she was getting an electric vehicle because there was a station there.

795
01:08:25,906 --> 01:08:30,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So, generally, when people get these electric vehicles, they, they don't have.

796
01:08:31,693 --> 01:08:35,438
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they are unable to charge at their own homes.

797
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people can charge at their own homes.

798
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:44,208
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just you got to get a special.

799
01:08:46,277 --> 01:08:47,517
[SPEAKER_02]: outlet or something, or?

800
01:08:47,897 --> 01:08:51,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Depends on how far you're driving every day.

801
01:08:52,118 --> 01:09:03,600
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not driving too many miles, like, you know, 20 miles or less, you can plug in with a regular 120 volt plug.

802
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:05,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

803
01:09:07,001 --> 01:09:15,082
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you want more, if you want to charge faster, you can put in an outlet that's like what your, what an electric dryer would plug into.

804
01:09:16,112 --> 01:09:16,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

805
01:09:16,933 --> 01:09:18,854
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would, that would charge a lot faster.

806
01:09:19,815 --> 01:09:21,256
[SPEAKER_06]: So most people can charge at home.

807
01:09:21,576 --> 01:09:26,019
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, I mean, the folks who like me don't have a driveway need to use public stations.

808
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:26,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

809
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,021
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a lot of, sorry.

810
01:09:29,441 --> 01:09:30,162
[SPEAKER_06]: No, go ahead.

811
01:09:30,222 --> 01:09:30,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

812
01:09:30,882 --> 01:09:35,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say a lot of people, um, will charge up at home.

813
01:09:35,525 --> 01:09:40,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if they're on longer drives, they'll top off wherever they're stopping.

814
01:09:41,351 --> 01:09:42,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.

815
01:09:42,392 --> 01:09:49,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, I was just trying to understand the whole, you know, sort of the system and sort of how it works.

816
01:09:49,201 --> 01:09:57,391
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I get that you don't have a driveway to, you know, so you can't necessarily plug in, but you still want to

817
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:11,923
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't know if that was sort of the vast majority, because I was kind of under the impression that you needed a special sort of outlet, you know, if charging stations have to be built in these different public places and such.

818
01:10:13,364 --> 01:10:14,025
[SPEAKER_02]: But I get it.

819
01:10:14,205 --> 01:10:22,492
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's just a regular outlet that you're plugging into, when you get to your place of business, you might need to plug in so that you can get back home.

820
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:24,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

821
01:10:24,594 --> 01:10:24,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

822
01:10:25,527 --> 01:10:30,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and does it work like, okay, are there time limits?

823
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:46,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you know, you get two hours, after two hours, you know, you need to, you know, unplug so someone else can plug in or do you just first come first serve kind of, is that kind of how it generally works?

824
01:10:46,839 --> 01:10:53,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's different at different places, but most places say that as long as you're plugged in and actively charging,

825
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:57,999
[SPEAKER_06]: you can stay plugged in there as long as you need to.

826
01:10:58,019 --> 01:11:08,686
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of times people will, their car will stop charging and they won't come out to move it for, you know, an hour.

827
01:11:09,066 --> 01:11:11,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that will frustrate other drivers.

828
01:11:12,168 --> 01:11:12,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

829
01:11:12,849 --> 01:11:19,213
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is there, do you, can you tell from the exterior if a car is fully charged?

830
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:20,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is there some sort of,

831
01:11:21,838 --> 01:11:27,501
[SPEAKER_02]: some sort of thing that anyone can walk by and be like, that car's fully charged.

832
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:28,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

833
01:11:28,261 --> 01:11:29,722
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll show on the charging station.

834
01:11:30,042 --> 01:11:31,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, on the station itself.

835
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:32,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah.

836
01:11:33,084 --> 01:11:33,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

837
01:11:35,487 --> 01:11:37,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let me start looking.

838
01:11:38,009 --> 01:11:40,950
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, Lizette, this is the page on Go Green Medford right now.

839
01:11:41,071 --> 01:11:51,197
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got the list of locations and it's got the link to the survey to ask people where they would like to see them.

840
01:11:51,217 --> 01:11:54,919
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have a map.

841
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:56,080
[SPEAKER_06]: We should have a map on there.

842
01:11:56,140 --> 01:12:00,343
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, that's part of what I want to make changes on on the website.

843
01:12:01,232 --> 01:12:11,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I thought there was gonna show, like the map as well as like, I don't know, blue bikes, like that goes on our thing as well.

844
01:12:20,431 --> 01:12:22,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so back to the priorities though.

845
01:12:28,913 --> 01:12:36,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm dropping in the chat the link to this spreadsheet.

846
01:12:38,798 --> 01:12:41,139
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also in the agenda that was sent out.

847
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:53,445
[SPEAKER_06]: So after this meeting, if you're thinking about it, you want to go back in, make any changes to it, you can do that then.

848
01:12:54,045 --> 01:12:55,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Add more things that you're interested in.

849
01:12:58,303 --> 01:13:00,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Brenda, did you press record in this meeting?

850
01:13:01,684 --> 01:13:04,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't, but Medford Community Media is here too.

851
01:13:04,385 --> 01:13:25,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, good.

852
01:13:25,852 --> 01:13:26,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thinking this might be

853
01:13:28,286 --> 01:13:35,788
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of a brainstorming meeting and then give people time to think about it more and add to this between now and the next meeting.

854
01:13:35,808 --> 01:13:48,351
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at the next meeting, we can sort of vote, unofficially vote on what areas we really want to focus on moving forward.

855
01:13:48,371 --> 01:13:52,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

856
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:06,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else people want to add here before we move on?

857
01:14:06,219 --> 01:14:11,102
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm all set.

858
01:14:14,524 --> 01:14:18,246
[SPEAKER_03]: If I think of anything, I'll add to it.

859
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:19,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

860
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,462
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we all set?

861
01:14:40,363 --> 01:14:41,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think so.

862
01:14:41,464 --> 01:14:47,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless there's anything, uh, any new business, any topics for the next meeting that we want to talk about.

863
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:58,199
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we added information about the electric grid and maybe more in depth, sort of electrify Medford.

864
01:14:58,279 --> 01:14:58,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

865
01:15:03,553 --> 01:15:09,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a full training like the coaches are doing, but yeah, more details.

866
01:15:13,261 --> 01:15:19,246
