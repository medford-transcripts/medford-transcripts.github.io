1
00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:03,914
Motion to accept the minutes from the last meeting.

2
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:10,318
Second.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,540
I as well.

4
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,802
Say aye in favor.

5
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:17,543
Aye.

6
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:18,764
Aye.

7
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:19,605
Aye.

8
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:20,345
OK.

9
00:00:21,226 --> 00:00:23,107
So then, yeah, we can start now.

10
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:45,698
I think the next thing on the agenda was, I was wondering if you wanted to have information on the website about you the same way that the Energy and Environment Committee has information on their site.

11
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,160
So let me pull up what they have.

12
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:55,584
Here we go.

13
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:58,971
Can you see that?

14
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:01,813
Yes, we can.

15
00:01:02,334 --> 00:01:02,614
Okay.

16
00:01:02,934 --> 00:01:03,354
So yeah.

17
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:07,797
So this is just their, their webpage on, on go green Medford.

18
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:22,888
Um, a little bit of information about them and then they get into the, sorry, the link to the agendas and the minutes and the recordings, and then they get into the bios and pictures of the members.

19
00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:29,917
Is that something you'd like to do for this group too?

20
00:01:38,503 --> 00:01:40,084
What did you say, Lizette?

21
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:43,667
I said that would be awesome.

22
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,133
So by comparison, this is what the Climate Equity Council page looks like right now.

23
00:01:54,152 --> 00:02:00,176
It just has the mission, the members, and then a link to the agendas and minutes.

24
00:02:01,957 --> 00:02:09,181
Yeah, I mean, we could, I would be fine with like putting my picture and just like, you know, Arabic Medford connector.

25
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:12,263
Because I don't even know what I would put for bio.

26
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:17,126
We can put the same thing that we did for the brochure.

27
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:23,030
like a short thing of like our state mission.

28
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:24,431
Yeah, that's true.

29
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:35,202
Brochures that never came out.

30
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:38,425
Do you have photos of the brochures too?

31
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:39,926
Would you like to include photos?

32
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:41,948
Yeah, we all have photos.

33
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,810
That's great.

34
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,952
Can someone here send those to me or should I reach out to Sophie?

35
00:02:51,972 --> 00:02:59,197
I have the pictures actually, Brenda, because I was the original sender to Penny when she was here.

36
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:02,380
Okay, great.

37
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:14,168
I'll send it first to our mission, our little paragraph that we did to everyone, see if they want to tweak it and I'll send everything to you.

38
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:17,277
Awesome, thank you.

39
00:03:18,478 --> 00:03:18,838
Of course.

40
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,480
Cool.

41
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:37,326
I guess then I think the only other thing in this administrative section here at the top of the meeting, I just want to remind folks that we had talked about our next meeting on June 24th being in person.

42
00:03:39,967 --> 00:03:45,449
Would you like that to be at City Hall or do you want to try to do a room in the library or something else?

43
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:47,944
Room in the library would be nice.

44
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:51,307
I agree.

45
00:03:51,948 --> 00:03:53,389
Especially because there's AC there.

46
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:56,692
Nice.

47
00:03:57,152 --> 00:03:57,412
Nice.

48
00:03:58,213 --> 00:04:01,456
Technically City Hall has AC, but it's an old system.

49
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:03,778
Yep.

50
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,560
But their workspace is so beautiful.

51
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:09,383
This should be taken advantage of too.

52
00:04:10,844 --> 00:04:11,024
Yep.

53
00:04:11,304 --> 00:04:11,885
That sounds good.

54
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:16,903
Perfect.

55
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:31,514
So I think that was it for the administrative stuff.

56
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:36,878
The next thing on the agenda was Medford Connects events.

57
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:42,562
What upcoming events do you have?

58
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:51,899
We have a lot actually send us a list of the ones that we were.

59
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,063
Approve or not approve of doing.

60
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:59,506
Let me see where is it.

61
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:02,788
So that we have the.

62
00:05:03,369 --> 00:05:05,931
Pride flag raising May 31st.

63
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:13,716
We have the Circle the Square, June 15th.

64
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,717
We have Hoops and Hope, June 9th.

65
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:26,679
We have Juneteenth Flag Raising, the 18th of June.

66
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,261
Multicultural Celebration, that's June 22nd.

67
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:35,762
And then Skate, Mingle, and Dance Event, the 29th of June.

68
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:38,971
So we have a couple.

69
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:46,773
Is circle the square June 5th, not the 15th?

70
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:48,274
I don't know.

71
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:49,254
She wrote 15th.

72
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:54,515
But if you see, if you know that it's the 5th, then maybe she didn't earn our email.

73
00:05:55,515 --> 00:05:57,096
My calendar says the 15th.

74
00:05:58,036 --> 00:05:58,436
Yeah.

75
00:05:58,856 --> 00:05:59,416
I don't know.

76
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:04,177
OK.

77
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:04,458
Yep.

78
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:05,278
It is the 15th.

79
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:05,698
Sorry.

80
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:06,198
OK.

81
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:17,767
I think I was thinking in the back of my head, the farmer's market, which starts on June 6th.

82
00:06:21,028 --> 00:06:21,308
Right.

83
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:25,770
It's always on a Thursday, right?

84
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:26,130
Yeah.

85
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:27,330
Yep.

86
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,431
Yep.

87
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:34,993
What is skate mingle and whatever the third thing was?

88
00:06:35,013 --> 00:06:36,213
And dance?

89
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:37,634
And dance, yeah.

90
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:39,734
That's a good question.

91
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:44,057
I don't know.

92
00:06:44,097 --> 00:06:55,340
There's just, I believe it's, um, I believe it's the gay student alliance or a gay straight, I don't know, GSA something.

93
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,781
I think that's what it was.

94
00:06:59,582 --> 00:06:59,922
Okay.

95
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:01,322
So, oh, it's another pride month event.

96
00:07:01,342 --> 00:07:01,762
Okay.

97
00:07:01,802 --> 00:07:02,042
Yeah.

98
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:02,862
Yeah.

99
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:09,604
At the La Conte skating rink, but I believe it's going to be roller skating.

100
00:07:09,624 --> 00:07:11,605
I believe they're going to put a roller floor down.

101
00:07:12,925 --> 00:07:13,726
That's very cool.

102
00:07:16,387 --> 00:07:18,068
So what are you going to?

103
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,990
Are you guys going to be at all of these with?

104
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,853
Materials about Medford connects or what?

105
00:07:24,953 --> 00:07:26,013
What's the plan?

106
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:32,057
I mean, I accepted all except for two, but I think so.

107
00:07:32,117 --> 00:07:33,298
I think that's the.

108
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:40,283
The goal for us to all have information about what we do and like our own like.

109
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:44,923
Goals like we had for the Haitian Flag Day, kind of the same thing.

110
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:47,483
Great.

111
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:48,403
Okay, cool.

112
00:07:54,284 --> 00:07:58,325
If we're not there, there'll be other liaisons and or connectors there.

113
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:01,745
When I say we, I'm talking about the three of us who are on the call right now.

114
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:03,026
Yeah.

115
00:08:04,386 --> 00:08:09,147
I think I'm pretty much at all of the events except for Circle.

116
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:10,407
Is it Circle in the Square?

117
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:11,277
Yep.

118
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,098
I won't be there for that.

119
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:22,722
I'm going to try to show up to all of them, but maybe I won't make all of them.

120
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:23,202
Yeah.

121
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:24,263
Yeah.

122
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:34,320
If I drop off some Electrify Medford flyers with Sophie, can you pick them up there to have at these events?

123
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:35,241
Yeah.

124
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:41,062
She usually brings like all the flyers and stuff from other organizations.

125
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:43,763
I'm sure.

126
00:08:44,463 --> 00:08:44,783
Sorry.

127
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:51,145
I was going to say it might be good to throw some compost flyers in there too.

128
00:08:52,605 --> 00:08:58,647
That might really be good for the Hoops and Hope in June as well.

129
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:00,988
That sounds great.

130
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:14,694
I'll be at Circle the Square and we'll have some kind of carnival-like games that have a climate message to them for that.

131
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:16,735
That sounds cool.

132
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:17,735
Yeah.

133
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:24,029
Brenda, I have a question.

134
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:29,471
I was just going to say, they'll probably be much better than our spin the wheel.

135
00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:33,893
We did our best.

136
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:35,854
Oh, I can't wait to see it.

137
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:42,996
These are just wooden games that people made, that this organization called Mass Energize made.

138
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:46,777
And we're renting them from them for the day.

139
00:09:53,022 --> 00:09:55,303
For those curious on our agenda.

140
00:09:56,504 --> 00:09:58,305
Are we going to talk about the composting?

141
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:00,346
Oh yes, yeah.

142
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:01,506
OK.

143
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:04,588
I'll ask the question when we get to it.

144
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:09,791
Anything else under Medford connects events?

145
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:13,773
No, I think that's it.

146
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,233
I usually like.

147
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,055
Sophie does like the month.

148
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:22,157
Like plan, so then I think like by the end of like.

149
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:31,601
two weeks before the end of June, we'll get another load of dates and stuff.

150
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:36,523
There is a multicultural something or other that's going on in June.

151
00:10:36,543 --> 00:10:37,744
I think that's June 22nd.

152
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:43,167
I don't know too much about that.

153
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:47,409
I don't know.

154
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:52,011
Is there going to be a Hispanic event?

155
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,768
Um, from what I heard, yes.

156
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:55,669
Yeah.

157
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:00,593
No, I know.

158
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:02,955
That's that was usually around, like, October.

159
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:04,276
Oh, October.

160
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:04,676
Okay.

161
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:08,399
Because I think Brazilian Portuguese, they might be August.

162
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:10,621
Aren't they?

163
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:11,822
Yeah, they're before us.

164
00:11:12,322 --> 00:11:13,163
It's all tentative.

165
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:14,004
It's all tentative.

166
00:11:14,064 --> 00:11:15,045
I'm just kind of.

167
00:11:16,386 --> 00:11:20,587
Brenda was asking about events, so these are some things that are potentially coming up.

168
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:24,148
We don't have nothing set in stone at this point, but.

169
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,330
Those are a couple of additional things that we have going on.

170
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,050
Cool.

171
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:30,530
Okay.

172
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:31,731
I'll keep them in mind then.

173
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:32,211
Yeah.

174
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:34,752
And.

175
00:11:39,883 --> 00:11:50,558
Are these is the multicultural celebration is that something that's being put on by the Office of Outreach and Prevention, or is that a different organization.

176
00:11:53,602 --> 00:11:56,326
I'm not really sure what the.

177
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:04,304
I'm not really sure who is putting it on and or what it's to include.

178
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:09,165
I think we'll probably get some more information about that in the next couple of weeks.

179
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:10,846
I just know it's on our calendar.

180
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:15,287
Yeah, the thing is, don't you remember Stacey?

181
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:22,368
Frances was the one who gave us the list of like all these dates and stuff.

182
00:12:22,968 --> 00:12:26,569
And she was going around saying what it was about, but obviously like it was too many

183
00:12:27,812 --> 00:12:31,997
I mean, we can ask her the things that Francis were telling us about.

184
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:35,081
That's those are primarily events.

185
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:38,385
Yeah, it roughly was the same.

186
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:42,329
It roughly was the same ones because remember, I was taking the notes when we were doing.

187
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:45,073
When we were on our meeting.

188
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:52,090
So, it was roughly like, I think there was some extra events, but it was a majority was the events that we were already.

189
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,412
That was in the email right now with Sophie.

190
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:57,974
So that's why I think she knows a bit more about it as well.

191
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:07,759
Okay, there's 1 other thing that I know about on May 29th.

192
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:16,675
there's the Black Health Series event focusing on asthma at the West Medford Community Center.

193
00:13:19,516 --> 00:13:29,423
And I'll be there with a portable induction cooktop to talk to people about natural gas and its connection to asthma.

194
00:13:30,683 --> 00:13:35,887
And we'll have a couple people from the Electrify Medford coaches who will be there too.

195
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:43,202
There'll be another Black Health, the final Black Health event will be in June.

196
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:48,387
I don't have the date off hand, but I do have it in my calendar.

197
00:13:49,448 --> 00:13:51,450
What is that one focusing on?

198
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,912
That's on men's health.

199
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:56,214
Plus there's going to be a Juneteenth event.

200
00:13:57,055 --> 00:13:59,978
There's a flag raising at City Hall for Juneteenth.

201
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:00,558
Yep.

202
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:18,204
And, you know, the Black Health series will wrap up sort of around Juneteenth, and it'll primarily be men's mental health, I think, mental health and men's health sort of thing.

203
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:25,306
And that is June 26th, I believe.

204
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:35,354
I'll send you the flyer that had all the dates.

205
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:46,299
It says that everything's being held at the library, but it turns out we've been doing it at the community center.

206
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:50,742
The library's booked pretty solid.

207
00:14:50,782 --> 00:14:54,984
I've been trying to book some things there in the evenings, and there's just no space.

208
00:14:55,484 --> 00:15:00,447
Yeah, we kind of got booked ourselves for Wednesday for some events.

209
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,170
You're right.

210
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:05,633
It's a hopping sort of place.

211
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:07,694
It's nice.

212
00:15:07,794 --> 00:15:08,875
Everyone wants to be there.

213
00:15:09,296 --> 00:15:10,016
Absolutely.

214
00:15:10,397 --> 00:15:15,521
As beautiful as the building is, people should be there and taking full advantage of it.

215
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,885
Because I tell you, Malden doesn't have anything like that.

216
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:22,587
And it would be nice.

217
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:37,794
To be honest, it would be really cool if we had our own building that we could do a ton of all of these events, you know, and not have to be doing it at the school.

218
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:44,417
People go there, you know, like a community center that's like nearer to us, if that makes any sense.

219
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:45,498
But just saying.

220
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:50,661
This is one of the things I want to talk about when we get to the Electrify Medford topic.

221
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:57,820
But anything else for the Medford Connects events?

222
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:03,465
Nothing that comes to mind.

223
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:04,426
Cool.

224
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:05,447
OK.

225
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:12,253
So I think the next thing on the agenda is city actions.

226
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:19,278
And the first thing I'm thinking of is top of mind is Electrify Medford.

227
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:27,132
Um, so we've done the first two coach trainings and there are three more over the next three weeks.

228
00:16:27,993 --> 00:16:38,040
We have 13 coaches who are actively participating in the trainings and there are, there are others who are, who are making up with other trainings by watching the recordings online.

229
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:42,843
Um, and three of our coaches are from the Haitian task force.

230
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:45,365
Awesome.

231
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:53,946
But we would love to have people who speak other languages other than Haitian Creole in this as well.

232
00:16:54,026 --> 00:17:01,389
So yeah, if you come across anyone who you think would be interested, please, please, please let them know.

233
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:10,312
So we have a basic web page on the city's website.

234
00:17:11,012 --> 00:17:12,753
And we have an introductory flyer.

235
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:22,118
And we have a Haitian Creole version of the flyer that Natasha translated for us just in time for Haitian Flag Day.

236
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:30,461
And then Samia has just sent along a Portuguese translation to me today, so that's that's great.

237
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:35,343
What is the process for this for the future?

238
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:38,184
Do I submit that form to Sophie?

239
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:42,425
That like breaks it down into the different languages?

240
00:17:42,445 --> 00:17:42,505
Yes.

241
00:17:45,203 --> 00:17:50,204
So Natasha had me do it this time, which is okay.

242
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:51,085
Oh, okay.

243
00:17:51,485 --> 00:18:00,807
You can, if you can just like put all the text that needs to be translated into the Word document like so, like how you saw it.

244
00:18:01,527 --> 00:18:05,589
And will you with the different languages and then we'll, we'll work on it.

245
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:07,669
I'm working on the Arabic translations.

246
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,990
I'm working on the Spanish one still.

247
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:18,630
I was going to say, Brenda, anything that's 500 words or less we can translate.

248
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,471
Yeah, that's great.

249
00:18:22,112 --> 00:18:24,913
And I should send it to you through Sophie, not directly to you.

250
00:18:24,933 --> 00:18:26,794
Yeah, if you can.

251
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:32,116
Awesome.

252
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:48,976
So yeah, so I think the way it will work is we'll have some flyers that are, you know, full flyers and in each language, and then we'll have one flyer that's English on one side and then little summaries and the different languages on the back.

253
00:18:54,039 --> 00:19:03,409
Moving forward, I'll be adding some more detailed information on the Go Green Medford site with links to incentive programs and things like that.

254
00:19:03,989 --> 00:19:10,516
And I'll be putting together some more flyers, as well as the questionnaire and the decarbonization roadmap.

255
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:12,859
So a lot more for me to do, more to come.

256
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:22,701
But anything that you see that we're like putting out there, let me know at any point if you have any feedback on it.

257
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:31,087
Like if I email it to you or you just see a flyer at an event or something, let me know, because always happy to change anything.

258
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:37,951
Brenda, I think I sent like an email, because I had a quick question about like the QR codes.

259
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:43,535
Do the both QR codes that you already have on the flyer, do they go to the same website?

260
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:45,246
No, they don't.

261
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:52,690
So one goes to, let's see, I can pull it up right here.

262
00:19:55,591 --> 00:19:58,013
One goes to signing up as a coach.

263
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:04,076
Another one is talk to a coach if you have some questions.

264
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:08,318
And the other one goes to one of the websites.

265
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,950
Yeah.

266
00:20:10,871 --> 00:20:17,556
So the main one that has the box around it that we're trying to call people's attention to is here.

267
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:19,257
This is the main site.

268
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:23,441
And then people can click to sign up to talk to a coach.

269
00:20:26,262 --> 00:20:37,707
And then the second one goes to the Go Green Medford site where I don't have a lot of additional information for this program on there right now.

270
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:52,033
There's lots of information that's been collected there over the years, but I do need to make some additional changes to this site for this in particular.

271
00:20:52,673 --> 00:20:55,755
And then the third one goes to the coach signup form.

272
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:57,396
OK.

273
00:20:58,377 --> 00:20:59,657
Do they all get translated?

274
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:05,820
That's a very good question.

275
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,621
So the two websites do.

276
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:14,884
Right now, I don't think the sign-up form does, which isn't very helpful.

277
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:16,445
Yeah.

278
00:21:18,646 --> 00:21:23,708
And I haven't found a way yet to translate the Smartsheet form

279
00:21:26,455 --> 00:21:38,144
So I might have to add links at the bottom of the text area to different Smartsheet forms that are in the different languages.

280
00:21:39,105 --> 00:21:43,988
Can you get the same thing that the city website has that translates it to different languages?

281
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:46,010
I was looking for that.

282
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:54,977
It didn't look like that was available for Smartsheets, because this is a different app than what the two websites are.

283
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:57,394
Yeah, makes sense.

284
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:05,880
But it's possible there's something out there and I just have not found it yet.

285
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,183
So I if I if I see something, Brenda, I'll send it to you.

286
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:11,223
Thank you.

287
00:22:11,243 --> 00:22:12,364
You're welcome.

288
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:32,898
just jotting that down in the notes that we need, still need translations of those forms.

289
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,621
Okay.

290
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:44,944
We're getting some fun props to draw people in when we're tabling.

291
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:55,811
We had a dollhouse at the Haitian Flag Day event that was really fun, that drew a lot of kids in and their parents, so we could have conversations.

292
00:22:57,705 --> 00:23:04,808
And like I mentioned, we'll have those carnival style square and for the Harvest Your Energy Festival in October.

293
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:12,310
We could have them for every event, but we are renting them, not the dollhouse, but the carnival games.

294
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,011
We're renting those for each event.

295
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:17,232
So we're being careful which ones we're using them for.

296
00:23:17,252 --> 00:23:20,153
Don't forget, Brenda, to modify the house.

297
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:28,864
Yes, Alicia's husband is actually going to put some solar panels on it for me.

298
00:23:30,205 --> 00:23:36,029
And he's going to 3D print a mini split and a heat pump water heater.

299
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:39,271
That's awesome.

300
00:23:43,754 --> 00:23:47,216
And I'm going to get a little cord so that we can plug in the little car.

301
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:55,347
But that dollhouse is available for any time.

302
00:23:55,447 --> 00:24:01,329
So if you want to use that dollhouse for any events, then you're welcome to borrow it.

303
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,512
It was a hit.

304
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:15,594
I want to have a kickoff event for Electrify Medford in early June, but I'm having a hard time finding a location.

305
00:24:15,614 --> 00:24:18,915
I think it should be an evening or weekend.

306
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:28,245
My first thought was the library, but that's not proving very easy to find a time for that.

307
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:38,771
So I was thinking maybe something like the Willis Ave Community Center in South Medford or the West Medford Community Center.

308
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:43,313
Is it a big event or is it like a mini?

309
00:24:44,473 --> 00:24:46,414
I expect there would probably be 30 people.

310
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:56,636
So a mini one, because I was suggesting I was going to suggest the front of the city hall because, you know, free space outside.

311
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:03,902
You know, but all depends on how many people you're estimating to go there.

312
00:25:04,543 --> 00:25:05,704
Yeah, that's true.

313
00:25:07,866 --> 00:25:09,547
It does make it dependent on weather.

314
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:10,928
Mm hmm.

315
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:11,769
Yeah.

316
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:13,851
It's a good idea.

317
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:14,852
I didn't even think of that.

318
00:25:16,013 --> 00:25:16,133
Yep.

319
00:25:18,075 --> 00:25:23,918
we can do with like tarps, like, you know, like the cover.

320
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:24,678
Yeah.

321
00:25:24,698 --> 00:25:25,438
Yeah.

322
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,360
Hey, we'll get people's attention.

323
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,422
You have like green balloons, orange balloons, you know?

324
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:33,762
Yeah.

325
00:25:33,862 --> 00:25:34,663
Oh, what is that?

326
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:40,446
And they'll be like, and you can have info of the compost thing because that thing was a success.

327
00:25:40,466 --> 00:25:42,687
I'm just kidding.

328
00:25:42,727 --> 00:25:42,907
Yeah.

329
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:45,348
But, you know, nice.

330
00:25:48,026 --> 00:25:59,090
Um, yeah, I was, I was really hoping to have something in like South Medford or West Medford, just because those are neighborhoods we're really trying to target with this pro with this program.

331
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:05,892
Um, and I, but I don't know a lot of areas, a lot of places where we could do it there.

332
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,553
Are there parks near them?

333
00:26:09,213 --> 00:26:11,294
I mean, there's Tufts park in South Medford.

334
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,015
Oh, that's a good one.

335
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:14,755
Yeah.

336
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:21,291
Well, and there's Duggar Park that's right across the street from the West Memphis Community Center.

337
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:26,114
So it could be that, you know, shoot for it.

338
00:26:26,594 --> 00:26:31,018
If an outdoor event is preferable, the park is right there.

339
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:43,286
And that it's poor weather, you know, perhaps the community center, you know, would be the rain place if necessary.

340
00:26:43,346 --> 00:26:44,988
And plus, you know, too, there's,

341
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:51,124
You know, if the community center is involved, is there bathrooms and stuff like that?

342
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:56,967
If the center will be open, you know.

343
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:01,490
So it's certainly a possibility.

344
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:09,194
I mean, you know, Lisa Crossman would be the person to reach out, reach out to for that.

345
00:27:09,214 --> 00:27:11,195
She's the ED over there.

346
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:19,441
Great.

347
00:27:22,282 --> 00:27:24,602
I don't know much about the Willis Street.

348
00:27:25,582 --> 00:27:31,424
I mean, I know it exists, but beyond that, I don't know much else about it.

349
00:27:31,704 --> 00:27:35,945
Yeah, that's a Medford Housing Authority development.

350
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:43,786
And actually, we applied for a federal earmark to replace the community center because it's too small.

351
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:47,527
So I'm not sure that it's large enough for something like this.

352
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:56,846
What exactly is, I mean, I don't know.

353
00:27:56,866 --> 00:28:00,886
I mean, Liz, you might, Liz, I can't hear you.

354
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:04,647
Lizette, you, perhaps you have a better idea.

355
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:08,488
I mean, would the community center be a big enough space?

356
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:14,409
I mean, I know you can fit 30 people in there if you're putting them in chairs and that sort of thing, but I don't know.

357
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:17,309
Is it like displays?

358
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,130
How close it is to the park?

359
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,430
That's one question.

360
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:21,929
How close is it?

361
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:24,533
It's just it's on the backside.

362
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:25,254
It's on.

363
00:28:25,294 --> 00:28:26,976
Are you familiar with Mystic River Road?

364
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,299
Yes, it's right behind.

365
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:33,865
It's right behind Mystic River Road is right behind the community center.

366
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:37,310
Yeah, so maybe like.

367
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:41,389
I guess you could say, depending on the weather, that can be open.

368
00:28:41,409 --> 00:28:44,870
And then you can have half and half, sort of.

369
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:49,113
Because people need to go to the bathroom and stuff like that.

370
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:52,615
They can take a little walk and go there.

371
00:28:53,495 --> 00:28:56,076
And there'll be maybe some booths of information.

372
00:28:56,096 --> 00:29:00,079
But majority of the stuff can be on the opposite side.

373
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:03,300
I mean, depending if the weather is good.

374
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,441
Yeah.

375
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:07,022
I mean, it's easy enough to scope it out.

376
00:29:07,062 --> 00:29:08,223
You know where Duggar Park is?

377
00:29:10,187 --> 00:29:10,829
Me personally.

378
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:11,650
Yeah.

379
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:12,713
Okay.

380
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:18,725
Maybe on to be honest, if I see it, maybe I'll remember, but as you see it, you probably you probably will.

381
00:29:19,246 --> 00:29:19,487
Yeah.

382
00:29:21,163 --> 00:29:25,807
Okay, well, it's certainly an option, I think, certainly a viable option.

383
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:29,191
Yeah, thanks for those suggestions.

384
00:29:29,711 --> 00:29:31,653
I don't know why I hadn't thought of outdoors before.

385
00:29:31,673 --> 00:29:34,356
That's a good idea.

386
00:29:34,376 --> 00:29:41,262
And we're also working with the mayor's schedule to have her come to it as well.

387
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:44,145
That's cool.

388
00:29:48,129 --> 00:29:51,051
I think that's it for Electrify Medford.

389
00:29:54,914 --> 00:30:01,199
Before we go on, I just wanted to connect up with the coach recordings.

390
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:05,082
Now, do we go to the

391
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,439
Is it America Rewiring or something?

392
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,520
Is that where the trainings are there?

393
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,381
Yes, Rewiring America.

394
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:16,681
OK.

395
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:21,602
Because I was kind of on the impression they were Zoom meetings that were being recorded.

396
00:30:21,662 --> 00:30:24,663
And I did connect to it.

397
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:26,264
So I kind of saw it.

398
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:30,525
But I wasn't really sure what I was looking at.

399
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:33,646
And I didn't click on very much.

400
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:35,027
So I just, you know.

401
00:30:35,907 --> 00:30:39,310
So they're available online as those recordings.

402
00:30:41,032 --> 00:30:47,758
But I know it can be hard for people sometimes to, you know, take the time to sit down to do it if they don't have a fixed time.

403
00:30:47,858 --> 00:30:54,745
So that's why we're doing the zoom meetings where we're really just getting on together and watching those recordings together.

404
00:30:55,305 --> 00:30:55,566
Yeah.

405
00:30:57,087 --> 00:31:01,997
But Edith from Abode is actually going to be joining us each time.

406
00:31:02,758 --> 00:31:07,627
And for the last half hour of the Zoom meeting, she'll just be there to answer people's questions.

407
00:31:08,812 --> 00:31:17,581
So there's quizzes and stuff, or there's some sort of test at the end of the four trainings that folks, do folks have to pass those?

408
00:31:18,362 --> 00:31:25,489
Yeah, so each of the sections, there are four sections, and each section has a quiz that's like 10 questions long or so.

409
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:31,875
Yeah, and you do need to pass it, but you can retake it multiple times if you

410
00:31:32,676 --> 00:31:44,422
if you don't do it the first time, it's really just a way for them to highlight sort of the most important topics that they're trying to get across in the recordings.

411
00:31:45,062 --> 00:31:45,242
Yeah.

412
00:31:46,483 --> 00:31:46,883
Thank you.

413
00:31:46,903 --> 00:31:47,983
Yeah.

414
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:57,088
Oh, composting.

415
00:32:00,044 --> 00:32:10,227
Yeah, Lizette, did I hear that you went to the, uh, that you went to the garbage to garden compost event?

416
00:32:10,247 --> 00:32:14,429
So luckily I passed by it without even realizing it.

417
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:23,391
And then my sister went crazy and I don't know if she like signed up for it, but she needs to get a compost thingy.

418
00:32:24,752 --> 00:32:28,533
So I was just curious to know where those are at the city hall.

419
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:34,679
Oh, so did you stop and get a bin?

420
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:41,428
No, I couldn't because it wasn't, I think it was, correct me if I'm wrong, the same day as the event?

421
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:46,075
The Haitian Flag Day event?

422
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:46,876
Am I crazy?

423
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:48,117
Yeah, it was.

424
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:49,159
Yeah.

425
00:32:51,938 --> 00:33:08,946
yeah um so yeah so your sister can sign up anytime oh no she signed up she just oh she already did okay yeah that's what i'm saying she needs to get the um composting bin but that's where like she doesn't know where to go so i would like to know where that goes so then i can tell people

426
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:12,568
That's interesting.

427
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:29,560
My impression was that they were doing that one big distribution event, and then they were going to drop the rest of them off at people's homes, like, you know, whenever it is that they've signed up for.

428
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,462
So if she signed up for it to start July 1st, it would be before them.

429
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:40,207
She texted me and she said, I signed up for them, but I don't know if I'll get one.

430
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:40,928
Nice.

431
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:47,333
Yeah, but I can double check that with Alicia to make sure what's going to happen.

432
00:33:47,353 --> 00:33:52,915
Because I don't think they were planning on doing another big bin distribution event.

433
00:33:52,975 --> 00:33:56,017
I think they were just going to drop them off at people's homes after that.

434
00:33:56,797 --> 00:33:57,117
Okay.

435
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:07,121
If anything, where, like, where at the City Hall can you go to ask or to sign up?

436
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:12,637
That would be my office, yeah.

437
00:34:13,157 --> 00:34:14,938
Planning Development and Sustainability room 308.

438
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,923
But also you could just go online to medfordcompost.com and that would have information there that we would have.

439
00:34:24,024 --> 00:34:24,404
Okay.

440
00:34:28,447 --> 00:34:29,087
That was perfect.

441
00:34:30,328 --> 00:34:30,528
Cool.

442
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:34,730
We have a little over 3,000 people signed up for composting now.

443
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:35,711
Wow.

444
00:34:36,151 --> 00:34:37,212
So there was a big jump.

445
00:34:38,113 --> 00:34:38,693
That's good.

446
00:34:40,002 --> 00:34:44,205
Wow, that almost doubled since last month when we met, hasn't it?

447
00:34:44,365 --> 00:34:46,307
Or it's more than doubled, hasn't it?

448
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:47,388
Well, it was about 2,000.

449
00:34:48,729 --> 00:34:50,210
It was about 2,000 before.

450
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,751
Oh, I thought it was less than that.

451
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:55,654
Well, there was like 1,000 who signed up to start doing it now.

452
00:34:56,415 --> 00:34:59,157
And then there were 1,200 who signed up to start in July.

453
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:03,500
So there's like 2,000 roughly total.

454
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,302
So we've had another 1,000 people sign up since then.

455
00:35:06,342 --> 00:35:06,943
That's awesome.

456
00:35:09,365 --> 00:35:15,088
But the goal is for us to have 4,000 people signed up by July 1st.

457
00:35:16,309 --> 00:35:20,391
So we're still trying to get the word out.

458
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:32,677
I think that's everything for the composting.

459
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:57,723
For the Andrews and McGlynn heating and cooling system updates, we presented to the school committee on April 29th about the plans for the heating systems for those schools and the repairs in the other three schools that are kind of being lumped in together in the contracting process.

460
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:05,922
And they were happy for us to continue with those plans.

461
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:17,828
At the same meeting, the school committee passed a resolution banning the purchase of fossil fuel equipment for the schools unless the school committee authorized it.

462
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:24,491
So the city or facility staff couldn't just replace

463
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:31,837
equipment that had broken down with new fossil fuel equipment, they'd have to go to the school committee first and get approval.

464
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:38,720
That's really good.

465
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:46,243
Definitely, yeah.

466
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:50,825
And then, oh, brand new thing here.

467
00:36:51,565 --> 00:36:52,826
We applied for

468
00:36:54,297 --> 00:37:04,385
technical assistance to put together a decarbonization roadmap for city-owned buildings, where we kind of outline, this is all the equipment in our buildings.

469
00:37:05,126 --> 00:37:07,608
These are the expected lifetimes of them.

470
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:19,017
This is what we would replace it with when it gets close to the end of its lifetime, and just have a plan set out for the next 30 years.

471
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:28,318
And we applied for technical assistance from the Department of Energy Resources for that.

472
00:37:28,518 --> 00:37:30,579
And we got that award.

473
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:41,607
So over the next couple of months, we're going to be working with their contractor that they've hired to help us to put together that roadmap.

474
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:51,875
So I need to be collecting lots of information about our buildings over the next couple of months to get that done.

475
00:37:53,876 --> 00:37:57,177
So Brenda, how does the financing for that work?

476
00:37:57,377 --> 00:38:05,219
I mean, okay, so we're looking at, you're looking at putting out a 30-year plan for lifespan.

477
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:22,544
Does that mean that the city begins now to start thinking about that and tucking money away, or is that a matter of grants from the state and our federal?

478
00:38:23,564 --> 00:38:30,013
To accomplish anything, you know, when when the lifespan of a building or whatever.

479
00:38:32,989 --> 00:38:47,053
So I mean, so the idea is that this plan means that we don't, we aren't stuck in situations like we are now where it's an emergency and we have to do it as quickly as possible because we're already, you know, we've already lost cooling in some places, right?

480
00:38:48,673 --> 00:39:01,296
So the idea is that with this plan outlined, we can say, okay, in, you know, three years, we're going to need to replace this, you know, water heater.

481
00:39:02,016 --> 00:39:06,700
No, or we're going to need to replace water heaters across all of these schools.

482
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,941
Let's apply for a grant in order to do that.

483
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:11,783
And it allows us to take, you know, to plan it out.

484
00:39:12,544 --> 00:39:14,926
Some of these grant timeframes can be really long.

485
00:39:15,946 --> 00:39:19,469
So, it makes it really difficult in an emergency situation.

486
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:23,092
So, having a plan like that makes it much easier to go out for those grants.

487
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:24,045
Right.

488
00:39:24,265 --> 00:39:47,001
I just didn't know if, you know, you know, you know, we're having the foresight to look, look ahead and, you know, are the dollars and cents sort of, you know, are the savings accounts, you know, being replenished and such in order to accomplish those goals, you know, three, three years down the road and that sort of thing.

489
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:47,942
But I get it.

490
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:50,103
It will be grants and that sort of thing.

491
00:39:51,504 --> 00:39:52,104
So that's good.

492
00:39:52,585 --> 00:39:55,026
Yeah, I mean, that's the goal is to be able to plan for that, right?

493
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:59,789
Whether it's or city funds, we, we definitely don't have the funds for all of that now.

494
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:01,991
Yeah, yeah, well, that's what I figured.

495
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:05,073
But, I mean, I think it's, I think it's great to have a plan in place.

496
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:08,835
And I, so I just kind of wondered, I mean, you know, a plan is great.

497
00:40:08,955 --> 00:40:14,499
So, you know, we, you know, we shouldn't, we shouldn't get caught, you know.

498
00:40:17,322 --> 00:40:22,885
I'm not going to say what I would normally say, but it won't catch us off guard.

499
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:23,605
Yeah.

500
00:40:24,366 --> 00:40:24,946
You know what I mean?

501
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:28,908
Because we've been planning for it, we saw it, we planned for it.

502
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:35,351
Now, the plan is here, how are we going to get it in action?

503
00:40:35,831 --> 00:40:40,053
Yeah, definitely.

504
00:40:43,048 --> 00:40:56,091
I mean, we have a lot just the next few years with the HVAC upgrades in the in the couple in Andrews and McGlynn repairs and three other schools and then the high school.

505
00:40:57,671 --> 00:41:03,536
either complete replacement or giant retrofit situation coming up on us, so.

506
00:41:03,856 --> 00:41:08,800
No way, they're thinking of rebuilding it?

507
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:15,125
Complete replacement sounds like the way to go there, gut and rejail.

508
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,227
Oh, so many memories.

509
00:41:18,408 --> 00:41:20,029
Yeah, but have you seen that place?

510
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:26,395
Yeah, I know, it's shaped like a jail, it looks like a jail, but it's the best place I've ever been.

511
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:30,475
I mean, the concrete steps are crumbling.

512
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:33,056
That's true.

513
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:34,496
It's kind of bad.

514
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:35,756
Yeah.

515
00:41:36,136 --> 00:41:37,917
I mean, that's what we'll be taking to account.

516
00:41:37,937 --> 00:41:47,219
So the Massachusetts School Building Association is going to be giving us funding for part of the cost of that.

517
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:56,242
And they require that you look at replacement and a retrofit and see which one makes the most sense.

518
00:41:57,916 --> 00:42:00,238
Will they come up with a plan, Brenda?

519
00:42:01,238 --> 00:42:04,481
Like showing what they will do, like architectural-wise?

520
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:05,201
Just curious.

521
00:42:05,662 --> 00:42:06,422
Oh yeah, we will.

522
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:06,822
We will.

523
00:42:06,842 --> 00:42:10,585
So we'll come up with the plans and we'll submit them to the MSBA.

524
00:42:10,605 --> 00:42:13,407
Yep.

525
00:42:13,868 --> 00:42:15,549
That's awesome.

526
00:42:16,189 --> 00:42:22,474
And there are arguments for both sides because the argument for keeping the existing building is, from my perspective,

527
00:42:23,937 --> 00:42:29,219
There's so much carbon emissions that went into the building of that building.

528
00:42:29,239 --> 00:42:37,142
And if you build a new one, you're putting all of that in again a second time.

529
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:42,244
And that's like half of a building's emissions over its lifetime is just in the building of it.

530
00:42:44,585 --> 00:42:45,205
That's true.

531
00:42:47,226 --> 00:42:53,488
So you think it's better that they just work with what's already there?

532
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,831
I think we need to look at it and see what it would take.

533
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:08,973
Because if it's so far gone that you would need to replace a lot of it anyway, it might not make sense to do that.

534
00:43:09,653 --> 00:43:10,693
Yeah.

535
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:15,635
If it's still in decent condition, then it might make sense to retrofit it.

536
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:16,935
That's true.

537
00:43:17,075 --> 00:43:17,255
Yeah.

538
00:43:17,646 --> 00:43:30,790
In all honesty, I went there the other day and I feel like there needs to be so many updates to that building that it might as well be like gutted, to be honest.

539
00:43:31,631 --> 00:43:33,431
That's what I'm hearing from a lot of people.

540
00:43:33,451 --> 00:43:38,393
Keeping an open mind, but a lot of people think that, yeah.

541
00:43:39,148 --> 00:43:44,371
Yeah, I mean, like I remember being there and it was summertime and we were all dying of heat.

542
00:43:44,951 --> 00:43:49,593
No matter how much you open the windows or anything, it was so hot.

543
00:43:50,013 --> 00:43:52,714
Then in the wintertime, it was cold like it wouldn't.

544
00:43:53,575 --> 00:43:57,677
It's really almost criminal, like what they put those kids through.

545
00:44:00,278 --> 00:44:00,598
Yeah.

546
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,260
And I should know I was, you know, I wasn't there not too long ago, you know.

547
00:44:07,822 --> 00:44:08,402
Every summer.

548
00:44:10,632 --> 00:44:14,173
I was there in 2000 till 2011.

549
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:20,954
And that thing, it's still, it's still the same, a little bit like, I don't know, everything deteriorates.

550
00:44:21,014 --> 00:44:29,835
So, you know, yeah, I mean, it would be a sin though, because they just did the science labs like a few years ago.

551
00:44:30,355 --> 00:44:32,296
Right, Brenda, they like remodeled it.

552
00:44:33,836 --> 00:44:35,276
It was like, that was like 2018.

553
00:44:35,336 --> 00:44:35,476
Yeah.

554
00:44:42,274 --> 00:44:44,816
I don't know, but I think that needs to be over.

555
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:45,976
Actually, 2015.

556
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:45,976
2015.

557
00:44:46,036 --> 00:44:54,382
Yeah, a few years after I graduated.

558
00:44:54,882 --> 00:44:55,222
Oh, wow.

559
00:44:55,362 --> 00:44:56,463
Almost 10 years ago now.

560
00:44:56,483 --> 00:44:57,644
Yeah.

561
00:44:58,144 --> 00:44:59,905
Oh, Brenda, please don't say that.

562
00:45:00,285 --> 00:45:02,687
Do you know when the school was rebuilt?

563
00:45:04,148 --> 00:45:04,828
The high school?

564
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,250
I don't.

565
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:08,130
1960 something?

566
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:08,431
Huh?

567
00:45:08,451 --> 00:45:08,811
1960 something?

568
00:45:13,138 --> 00:45:24,547
No, I think it was after that, because it wasn't that it wasn't that old when I 19, I mean, 1894 between 1894 to 18.

569
00:45:24,647 --> 00:45:27,950
No, not not the old was the rear wing.

570
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:33,675
No, I'm talking about the new high school on Winter Street, not the not the high school that was on.

571
00:45:33,695 --> 00:45:37,618
What is it on Forest Street?

572
00:45:42,655 --> 00:45:44,035
Yes, now, isn't it?

573
00:45:44,316 --> 00:45:48,157
Yes, yes, near the theater, right?

574
00:45:48,257 --> 00:45:49,797
That's where the old one used to be.

575
00:45:49,857 --> 00:45:50,697
That's right.

576
00:45:50,737 --> 00:45:55,098
That's the old now that might have been built in 18,000 or something.

577
00:45:55,698 --> 00:45:56,079
Yeah.

578
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:57,059
Which one?

579
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:59,880
I'm talking about the one on Winthrop Street.

580
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,940
When was that built?

581
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:04,874
I'm thinking in the 70s.

582
00:46:05,354 --> 00:46:08,336
Well, you're talking about the one that Charbel and I went?

583
00:46:08,737 --> 00:46:10,078
The current high school.

584
00:46:10,218 --> 00:46:12,760
Yeah, that was in the 70s, I think.

585
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,760
That's what I'm thinking.

586
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,061
Yeah, 1970s.

587
00:46:15,642 --> 00:46:21,726
It wasn't that old, but even at that time, it was starting to, you know.

588
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:23,107
Yeah.

589
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,729
Just think about all the stuff that.

590
00:46:26,749 --> 00:46:30,252
In 30 years, there should be some kind of

591
00:46:32,265 --> 00:46:33,625
refurbishing going on.

592
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:35,346
Refurbish.

593
00:46:36,546 --> 00:46:37,926
And up to the plumbing.

594
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:41,087
And ongoing maintenance going on.

595
00:46:41,487 --> 00:46:42,047
Yeah.

596
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:43,407
Yeah.

597
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:44,527
Yeah.

598
00:46:45,747 --> 00:46:47,668
That must cost a lot to run that place.

599
00:46:48,668 --> 00:47:01,110
No, because it's like it's really embarrassing because like if you look at the other cities, beautiful high schools with like brand new facilities and stuff every every couple of years.

600
00:47:02,932 --> 00:47:05,175
Well it's kind of like the Andrews and the McGlynn.

601
00:47:06,077 --> 00:47:09,462
How they totally made that brand spanking new.

602
00:47:09,582 --> 00:47:11,685
Like it was top notch.

603
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:13,027
Yeah.

604
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,952
It should be something like that.

605
00:47:20,707 --> 00:47:26,569
So I think the only other thing that I had here was the Energy and Environment Committee update.

606
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:29,670
This is an exciting one, actually.

607
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:34,672
So their May 6th meeting, Senator Barrett attended.

608
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:41,234
He's the head of the Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy Committee.

609
00:47:41,254 --> 00:47:47,777
And he talked about the omnibus climate bill that his committee is working on this year.

610
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:56,055
And it should be finalized by the end of July, has to be finalized by the end of July if it's gonna be passed this year.

611
00:47:56,075 --> 00:48:00,558
It has like 50 to 60 different parts to it.

612
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:06,402
But he mostly talked about siting and permitting of energy infrastructure.

613
00:48:06,422 --> 00:48:13,988
So one of the parts of this bill would create one comprehensive permit

614
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:19,730
that municipalities would use.

615
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:26,054
So instead of having multiple permits for synergy infrastructure, there would just be one comprehensive permit that covered everything.

616
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:38,022
And this would be for things like substations and transmission lines and things like that.

617
00:48:39,864 --> 00:48:47,506
And if the city did not have the permit or approves it with conditions, it could be appealed to a statewide siting.

618
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:52,708
And then they would consider it and their decision would be contained.

619
00:48:54,849 --> 00:49:01,771
And then folks could, people could lose decisions, but by appealing that to the state Supreme Judicial Court.

620
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:17,495
So it was interesting because I think energy infrastructure siting is something that you get arguments against from a couple different sides, right?

621
00:49:17,515 --> 00:49:23,581
So you've got the people who are saying like often these things are cited in environmental justice communities.

622
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:30,502
and they shouldn't be, and there needs to be more consideration around that.

623
00:49:31,323 --> 00:49:42,351
And then there's the people who have more money and are saying, we don't want this in our backyards, which is why it gets put into environmental justice communities.

624
00:49:42,871 --> 00:49:47,615
And so this is kind of trying to kind of go down that middle path.

625
00:49:55,252 --> 00:50:00,715
He also talked very briefly about a few other parts of the bill.

626
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:07,518
Right now, residents have a right to natural gas.

627
00:50:08,058 --> 00:50:15,242
If there is no natural gas hookup to their house, the utility is required to connect to it.

628
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:23,506
This part of the bill would make it not a right to natural gas, but a right to heat.

629
00:50:24,499 --> 00:50:31,043
So it's not saying how your heat has to be served, but you have to have a way of heating your house.

630
00:50:31,923 --> 00:50:37,567
So if that way is with electricity, then there's not that right to get natural gas.

631
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:49,033
There's also part of it is a ban on competitive electricity suppliers for individuals.

632
00:50:49,754 --> 00:50:51,755
So that's sort of the door to door like,

633
00:50:52,944 --> 00:51:01,250
Companies that are kind of predatory and signing people up for contracts that are more expensive than what the utility offers.

634
00:51:04,372 --> 00:51:09,616
That's something that I'm really looking forward to is that ban because we had someone come into the office a couple weeks ago.

635
00:51:11,175 --> 00:51:16,077
who didn't know that she'd been signed up for one of these competitive suppliers.

636
00:51:16,837 --> 00:51:22,920
And it was $0.05 per kilowatt more expensive than Medford's aggregation.

637
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,841
Oh, my God.

638
00:51:26,662 --> 00:51:31,964
That's like... Yeah, it was a difference between like $0.13 and $0.18.

639
00:51:32,004 --> 00:51:32,104
Yeah.

640
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,291
It's a lot of money in the long run.

641
00:51:42,713 --> 00:51:43,574
And she didn't know about it.

642
00:51:43,594 --> 00:51:52,403
I assume someone must have just come to her door and was talking to her and asked to see her utility bill and got her account number and signed her up that way.

643
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:55,326
Yeah.

644
00:51:58,709 --> 00:51:59,590
So I'm looking forward to that.

645
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:13,041
Another thing he talked about is this bill, one of the aspects of it would change the requirement for National Grid to purchase electric supply every six months.

646
00:52:13,081 --> 00:52:24,090
So one of the reasons that Medford's aggregation is lower than the utilities rate most of the time is because the utilities are required to purchase electricity at six month intervals.

647
00:52:24,611 --> 00:52:26,932
So they're locked into the times when they buy it.

648
00:52:27,673 --> 00:52:33,661
So that's why there are those fluctuations because they have to buy during different seasons and they have to buy every six months.

649
00:52:34,642 --> 00:52:44,856
So this would allow them to do the same thing that Medford's aggregation is doing basically, which is time when their electricity is for times when the market's lower.

650
00:52:45,898 --> 00:52:49,099
lock it in for longer periods of time, things like that.

651
00:52:51,739 --> 00:53:06,862
That might make Medford's aggregation a little bit less competitive with National Grid's basic rate, but it would also mean that National Grid's regular rate would be a cheaper option for everybody too.

652
00:53:07,702 --> 00:53:09,062
It would save people money in the end.

653
00:53:10,242 --> 00:53:14,623
Wouldn't that mean that National Grid would have a monopoly on

654
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:20,649
electric?

655
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:22,751
I mean, they don't technically.

656
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:25,793
So technically, utilities are a regulated monopoly.

657
00:53:27,775 --> 00:53:33,261
Just because the distribution systems that they manage, you can only have one, basically.

658
00:53:33,281 --> 00:53:36,123
That's only allowed one in each town.

659
00:53:39,443 --> 00:53:42,525
which is why we only have national grid here in Medford.

660
00:53:42,545 --> 00:53:45,768
You don't have lots of utilities vying for each other.

661
00:53:45,788 --> 00:53:47,489
Yeah.

662
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:58,197
I was going to say, because they can just charge however they want, how much they want in the end.

663
00:53:59,198 --> 00:54:01,159
But it's already a thing, so never mind.

664
00:54:02,255 --> 00:54:09,516
I mean, they have oversight from the Department of Public Utilities, so they have to submit their rate plans and everything and get approval through that.

665
00:54:09,536 --> 00:54:15,417
That's true.

666
00:54:15,557 --> 00:54:26,919
And then another aspect of the bill that he talked about was a bottle bill that will increase deposits to 10 cents and will cover more bottles.

667
00:54:27,239 --> 00:54:31,260
So it'll cover like the little nips that you see thrown on the ground everywhere too.

668
00:54:38,273 --> 00:54:40,335
So I think that was most of what he talked about.

669
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:42,818
I thought it was really interesting.

670
00:54:43,298 --> 00:54:59,875
I think mainly the reason that he was coming to the Energy Committee was because he was doing sort of a roadshow going to municipalities, talking to them about the siting and permitting aspect of it to get feedback on that.

671
00:55:06,062 --> 00:55:09,584
So that's it for my information.

672
00:55:09,644 --> 00:55:16,207
Was there anything about any of that that you had questions about or wanted to talk about?

673
00:55:16,227 --> 00:55:25,252
Nothing for me.

674
00:55:27,913 --> 00:55:30,334
Yeah, I think I'm all set.

675
00:55:30,454 --> 00:55:33,516
I was just kind of confused a little bit about the

676
00:55:34,672 --> 00:55:35,773
national grid thing.

677
00:55:36,674 --> 00:55:41,698
If you wouldn't mind just like, I don't know, explaining one more time.

678
00:55:42,258 --> 00:55:42,878
Oh, sure.

679
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:43,259
Yeah.

680
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:52,606
So national grid, um, so they're a regulated monopoly for the distribution of, um, energy of electricity.

681
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:57,430
Um, and, and gas where they, where they do gas as well.

682
00:55:57,450 --> 00:55:58,571
Um,

683
00:56:00,345 --> 00:56:06,191
And so it's because they manage all of the lines and the pipes and stuff that go to your house.

684
00:56:07,132 --> 00:56:11,517
They don't actually create any electricity themselves.

685
00:56:11,537 --> 00:56:13,459
Like they don't do any supply themselves.

686
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,804
They're just buying it on the open market and having it on to customers.

687
00:56:18,905 --> 00:56:19,085
Yeah.

688
00:56:20,235 --> 00:56:21,856
Yeah.

689
00:56:21,876 --> 00:56:38,842
And the Department of Public Utilities, and they had been required to purchase their electricity at specific times so that the companies that did generate the electricity would know when to expect these purchases to happen.

690
00:56:42,585 --> 00:56:52,317
But, so that made it more reliable for those companies, but it also meant that, you know, it did increase the prices for, for customers too.

691
00:56:52,337 --> 00:56:55,081
Yeah.

692
00:56:57,203 --> 00:56:57,384
Yeah.

693
00:56:58,986 --> 00:56:59,386
Okay.

694
00:56:59,466 --> 00:56:59,827
Thank you.

695
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:16,012
And if you're interested, for a future meeting, we can talk about the electric grid and, like, I don't know, the local distribution and the ISO New England and how that's managed and Department of Public Utilities and all of that.

696
00:57:17,093 --> 00:57:21,216
Let's put that on the agenda for next meeting.

697
00:57:22,778 --> 00:57:23,058
Cool.

698
00:57:23,438 --> 00:57:28,903
You made a spreadsheet, correct, to put, like, the topics?

699
00:57:34,086 --> 00:57:34,747
Oh, bless you.

700
00:57:35,788 --> 00:57:38,730
All right.

701
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:44,555
Yeah, so that's our next agenda item, actually, is our priorities.

702
00:57:44,575 --> 00:57:49,159
I have a question, Brenda.

703
00:57:49,219 --> 00:58:00,429
If there's something like a certain, I mean, when you send us the minutes for like, you know, our meetings, if things are misspelled, is that okay?

704
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:01,890
Or can I tell you what?

705
00:58:02,398 --> 00:58:06,380
Oh, please tell me I'll correct them before we actually put it up online.

706
00:58:06,921 --> 00:58:27,852
I mean, it sounds dumb, but it's just like it's supposed to say they just put, but they put, you put the T-B-E-Y where it says, um, underneath number two city communications, uh, underneath where it says tax bills, it says there's also Tufts daily.

707
00:58:27,872 --> 00:58:28,973
Hmm.

708
00:58:29,013 --> 00:58:31,054
I don't know if you can see it.

709
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:35,546
I'm pulling it up in front of me right now.

710
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:37,147
Oh, good one.

711
00:58:37,607 --> 00:58:37,928
Okay.

712
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:40,929
Yes, thank you.

713
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:42,410
You're welcome.

714
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:49,673
And I was gonna say, if you need anything for the event for the Electrify Medford, let us know.

715
00:58:54,116 --> 00:59:00,639
Anything for in terms of translation or... Translation or I think help as well too, I mean,

716
00:59:01,492 --> 00:59:03,053
we're not opposed to helping.

717
00:59:03,073 --> 00:59:07,457
And that's within the scope of it, obviously, which I think it is, so.

718
00:59:10,299 --> 00:59:11,239
Yeah, that's awesome.

719
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:22,008
I mean, I think part of it is definitely making sure to get you the flyers for Electrify Medford and having you be comfortable talking about it with people.

720
00:59:24,446 --> 00:59:38,618
So if you feel you need more, sort of more training on any of that, let me know and we can follow up in future meetings with more info.

721
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:39,699
Yeah.

722
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:43,722
I mean, we can do that for a meeting, no?

723
00:59:43,902 --> 00:59:44,622
With all of us.

724
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:48,786
So we're on the same page of what we can, what, you know,

725
00:59:50,118 --> 00:59:53,322
We say when we talk to people and things like that.

726
00:59:53,743 --> 00:59:55,084
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

727
00:59:55,104 --> 01:00:07,200
I bet you've heard me talk about it so many times that you could give the summary in your sleep, but.

728
01:00:10,882 --> 01:00:19,029
There are some things that I get asked that are a little weird sometimes, so it's nice to have a little preparation for that.

729
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:28,518
Somebody this weekend started talking to me about how he doesn't trust anything the government does, and that's why he didn't get his COVID shot.

730
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,341
I can't breathe.

731
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:32,701
Yeah.

732
01:00:33,342 --> 01:00:36,104
I was like, OK, that's a little bit out of my purview here.

733
01:00:38,284 --> 01:00:45,429
You imagine how many questions the mayor would get or, like, any other, like, political they're like about those questions that I'm really just like.

734
01:00:46,189 --> 01:00:47,450
I don't even know how to answer that.

735
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:49,632
I mean, it's hard.

736
01:00:51,793 --> 01:00:52,854
It's hard to deal with that.

737
01:00:52,874 --> 01:00:54,035
That's crazy.

738
01:00:58,038 --> 01:01:07,124
So, um, what I was thinking of in terms of these priorities is not just necessarily like, just topics to talk about at future meetings, but if there are, um.

739
01:01:08,403 --> 01:01:26,195
projects that you want to work on or you want to be involved in or consulted on or anything like that, then you'd want to have them listed in here so that you can decide what to focus on as a group.

740
01:01:28,516 --> 01:01:36,602
And one of the things that I was thinking of was just keeping in mind sort of the mission of the Climate Equity Council.

741
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:51,692
to advise the city on implementation of the Climate Action Plan with a focus on representing the interests of previously underrepresented groups based primarily on members' lived experiences and perspectives they've garnered from their communities.

742
01:01:51,732 --> 01:02:03,037
The council will give feedback on proposed city actions, including neighborhood-specific projects, building and energy projects, stormwater projects, public health projects, and transportation projects.

743
01:02:08,687 --> 01:02:18,533
And I think we've talked about all of those areas here with multiple different things that are going on with each of them.

744
01:02:21,775 --> 01:02:32,362
So if there are ones you're particularly interested in or you want to make sure that you're continuing on moving forward, I want to try to get it in here.

745
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:54,567
Um, it's like, is there a list of like, ongoing projects that like mentioned, like, that you, that would be, you know, good for us to electrify Medford is, is one of those projects, right?

746
01:02:55,368 --> 01:02:55,848
Yeah.

747
01:02:55,988 --> 01:03:03,654
So yeah, I'm just, I'm dropping some, a few things in here that we've talked about in previous meetings that,

748
01:03:07,496 --> 01:03:14,818
seemed like they were things he might want to focus on.

749
01:03:22,541 --> 01:03:25,261
And some of these things you might say it's too broad.

750
01:03:27,465 --> 01:03:37,995
It's too broad or, well, like, yes, there are topics in this area that I'm interested in, but let's focus in on particular things, right?

751
01:03:38,736 --> 01:03:41,539
Or actually, that's not the way I see this committee going.

752
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:44,482
Let's focus in on something more hands-on or whatever.

753
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:14,032
Yeah, so just a few things that I just dropped in here.

754
01:04:15,193 --> 01:04:31,602
Electrify Medford, composting, stormwater education, school outreach, city policy, state federal policy, city building upgrades, city transportation projects.

755
01:04:33,792 --> 01:04:48,037
These are things that are the top of my mind, but there could be other things that other departments work on that you might be interested in that I haven't been, you know, directly involved in that I could reach out to people and pull them into.

756
01:05:14,413 --> 01:05:16,514
We took out of our list to the.

757
01:05:20,597 --> 01:05:21,817
The electric cars, right?

758
01:05:27,581 --> 01:05:28,601
We can add it back in though.

759
01:05:28,641 --> 01:05:30,182
This is all open.

760
01:05:33,484 --> 01:05:35,125
Open discussion electric.

761
01:05:35,425 --> 01:05:38,147
I thought we, I don't know if.

762
01:05:39,107 --> 01:05:41,649
I remember correctly that we were going to update where, like.

763
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:46,413
there was going to be more spots to be able to charge your car.

764
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:56,341
So are you?

765
01:05:56,421 --> 01:05:56,801
Yes.

766
01:05:56,881 --> 01:05:58,542
Are you thinking charging stations?

767
01:05:58,562 --> 01:06:04,227
Because I remember you showed us like where there was already and when there was going to be.

768
01:06:04,267 --> 01:06:07,409
So I was just curious to know if like they put them in.

769
01:06:08,933 --> 01:06:10,113
where they were planning to.

770
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:13,194
We've got most of them in now.

771
01:06:13,234 --> 01:06:20,616
We're still waiting on National Grid to connect the station that's installed at West Medford parking lot.

772
01:06:21,876 --> 01:06:30,859
A charger is being installed at the DPW this week and at the police station next week.

773
01:06:32,139 --> 01:06:35,540
Although the police station one is just for their use, it's not open to the public.

774
01:06:38,497 --> 01:06:43,741
Wouldn't also, Brenda, the station for the bikes?

775
01:06:48,105 --> 01:06:49,186
Blue bike stations.

776
01:07:01,215 --> 01:07:07,040
Are you thinking of giving feedback on where the station should be located in the future?

777
01:07:09,118 --> 01:07:33,683
yeah i think that as well as like um where maybe like do you guys have it in your in the electrified medford like links to where like the maps are that shows where those things are what where is it where is it under because let me see

778
01:07:34,603 --> 01:07:39,646
Let me stop screen sharing while I look for this.

779
01:07:39,806 --> 01:07:41,907
It's on the Go Green Medford website.

780
01:07:42,527 --> 01:07:42,867
Okay.

781
01:07:43,908 --> 01:07:45,329
Do they have any at the schools?

782
01:07:46,509 --> 01:07:47,070
Yes.

783
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:49,491
There's one at the high school.

784
01:07:49,511 --> 01:07:50,511
That's good.

785
01:07:51,672 --> 01:07:54,033
There is one at the Brooks.

786
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:55,494
There's one at the Missituck.

787
01:07:55,634 --> 01:07:56,915
There's one at the Roberts.

788
01:07:59,116 --> 01:07:59,276
Good.

789
01:08:00,176 --> 01:08:04,818
There's one at Hormel Stadium, so it's not technically at McLean or Andrews, but it's nearby.

790
01:08:04,838 --> 01:08:06,779
Yeah, close enough.

791
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:09,760
It's good.

792
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:17,324
I've actually had some, uh, some teachers, well, a teacher, I've had two teachers reach out to me.

793
01:08:17,424 --> 01:08:19,985
One of them was interested in getting an electric vehicle.

794
01:08:20,625 --> 01:08:24,287
And one of them said she was getting an electric vehicle because there was a station there.

795
01:08:25,906 --> 01:08:30,872
So, generally, when people get these electric vehicles, they, they don't have.

796
01:08:31,693 --> 01:08:35,438
They, they are unable to charge at their own homes.

797
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,404
Most people can charge at their own homes.

798
01:08:41,866 --> 01:08:44,208
It's just you got to get a special.

799
01:08:46,277 --> 01:08:47,517
outlet or something, or?

800
01:08:47,897 --> 01:08:51,218
Depends on how far you're driving every day.

801
01:08:52,118 --> 01:09:03,600
If you're not driving too many miles, like, you know, 20 miles or less, you can plug in with a regular 120 volt plug.

802
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:05,860
Oh.

803
01:09:07,001 --> 01:09:15,082
And if you want more, if you want to charge faster, you can put in an outlet that's like what your, what an electric dryer would plug into.

804
01:09:16,112 --> 01:09:16,472
Okay.

805
01:09:16,933 --> 01:09:18,854
And that would, that would charge a lot faster.

806
01:09:19,815 --> 01:09:21,256
So most people can charge at home.

807
01:09:21,576 --> 01:09:26,019
It's, I mean, the folks who like me don't have a driveway need to use public stations.

808
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:26,679
Yeah.

809
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,021
And then a lot of, sorry.

810
01:09:29,441 --> 01:09:30,162
No, go ahead.

811
01:09:30,222 --> 01:09:30,642
I'm sorry.

812
01:09:30,882 --> 01:09:35,265
I was just going to say a lot of people, um, will charge up at home.

813
01:09:35,525 --> 01:09:40,669
And then if they're on longer drives, they'll top off wherever they're stopping.

814
01:09:41,351 --> 01:09:42,172
Right, right.

815
01:09:42,392 --> 01:09:49,121
I just, you know, I was just trying to understand the whole, you know, sort of the system and sort of how it works.

816
01:09:49,201 --> 01:09:57,391
I mean, I get that you don't have a driveway to, you know, so you can't necessarily plug in, but you still want to

817
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:11,923
But I didn't know if that was sort of the vast majority, because I was kind of under the impression that you needed a special sort of outlet, you know, if charging stations have to be built in these different public places and such.

818
01:10:13,364 --> 01:10:14,025
But I get it.

819
01:10:14,205 --> 01:10:22,492
If it's just a regular outlet that you're plugging into, when you get to your place of business, you might need to plug in so that you can get back home.

820
01:10:22,932 --> 01:10:24,053
Yeah, exactly.

821
01:10:24,594 --> 01:10:24,834
Yeah.

822
01:10:25,527 --> 01:10:30,010
Yeah, and does it work like, okay, are there time limits?

823
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:46,419
Okay, you know, you get two hours, after two hours, you know, you need to, you know, unplug so someone else can plug in or do you just first come first serve kind of, is that kind of how it generally works?

824
01:10:46,839 --> 01:10:53,203
Yeah, it's different at different places, but most places say that as long as you're plugged in and actively charging,

825
01:10:55,458 --> 01:10:57,999
you can stay plugged in there as long as you need to.

826
01:10:58,019 --> 01:11:08,686
A lot of times people will, their car will stop charging and they won't come out to move it for, you know, an hour.

827
01:11:09,066 --> 01:11:11,708
And then that will frustrate other drivers.

828
01:11:12,168 --> 01:11:12,529
Yeah.

829
01:11:12,849 --> 01:11:19,213
I mean, is there, do you, can you tell from the exterior if a car is fully charged?

830
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:20,654
I mean, is there some sort of,

831
01:11:21,838 --> 01:11:27,501
some sort of thing that anyone can walk by and be like, that car's fully charged.

832
01:11:27,841 --> 01:11:28,201
Oh, yeah.

833
01:11:28,261 --> 01:11:29,722
It'll show on the charging station.

834
01:11:30,042 --> 01:11:31,603
Oh, on the station itself.

835
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:32,804
Ah.

836
01:11:33,084 --> 01:11:33,204
Yep.

837
01:11:35,487 --> 01:11:37,268
Yeah, let me start looking.

838
01:11:38,009 --> 01:11:40,950
So yeah, Lizette, this is the page on Go Green Medford right now.

839
01:11:41,071 --> 01:11:51,197
It's got the list of locations and it's got the link to the survey to ask people where they would like to see them.

840
01:11:51,217 --> 01:11:54,919
It doesn't have a map.

841
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:56,080
We should have a map on there.

842
01:11:56,140 --> 01:12:00,343
But again, that's part of what I want to make changes on on the website.

843
01:12:01,232 --> 01:12:11,983
Yeah, that's what I thought there was gonna show, like the map as well as like, I don't know, blue bikes, like that goes on our thing as well.

844
01:12:20,431 --> 01:12:22,193
Okay, so back to the priorities though.

845
01:12:28,913 --> 01:12:36,137
I'm dropping in the chat the link to this spreadsheet.

846
01:12:38,798 --> 01:12:41,139
It was also in the agenda that was sent out.

847
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:53,445
So after this meeting, if you're thinking about it, you want to go back in, make any changes to it, you can do that then.

848
01:12:54,045 --> 01:12:55,566
Add more things that you're interested in.

849
01:12:58,303 --> 01:13:00,144
Brenda, did you press record in this meeting?

850
01:13:01,684 --> 01:13:04,065
I didn't, but Medford Community Media is here too.

851
01:13:04,385 --> 01:13:25,832
Okay, good.

852
01:13:25,852 --> 01:13:26,873
I'm thinking this might be

853
01:13:28,286 --> 01:13:35,788
sort of a brainstorming meeting and then give people time to think about it more and add to this between now and the next meeting.

854
01:13:35,808 --> 01:13:48,351
And then at the next meeting, we can sort of vote, unofficially vote on what areas we really want to focus on moving forward.

855
01:13:48,371 --> 01:13:52,632
Sounds good.

856
01:14:01,837 --> 01:14:06,199
Anything else people want to add here before we move on?

857
01:14:06,219 --> 01:14:11,102
No, I'm all set.

858
01:14:14,524 --> 01:14:18,246
If I think of anything, I'll add to it.

859
01:14:19,167 --> 01:14:19,607
Sounds good.

860
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:39,462
So are we all set?

861
01:14:40,363 --> 01:14:41,343
Yeah, I think so.

862
01:14:41,464 --> 01:14:47,589
Unless there's anything, uh, any new business, any topics for the next meeting that we want to talk about.

863
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:58,199
I think we added information about the electric grid and maybe more in depth, sort of electrify Medford.

864
01:14:58,279 --> 01:14:58,379
Yeah.

865
01:15:03,553 --> 01:15:09,398
Not a full training like the coaches are doing, but yeah, more details.

866
01:15:13,261 --> 01:15:19,246
OK, then motion to adjourn the meeting, if nobody has questions.

867
01:15:23,409 --> 01:15:23,529
Aye.

868
01:15:23,549 --> 01:15:26,972
Do you have a second the motion first?

869
01:15:27,292 --> 01:15:27,753
Second.

870
01:15:32,173 --> 01:15:33,974
Hi, favor to adjourn the meeting.

871
01:15:33,994 --> 01:15:37,956
Hi, sorry, guys.

872
01:15:39,937 --> 01:15:40,758
You're good.

873
01:15:42,599 --> 01:15:43,459
No, I'm not.

874
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:47,241
It's that weather.

875
01:15:47,261 --> 01:15:49,102
Oh, no.

876
01:15:49,282 --> 01:15:50,223
Are you sick too?

877
01:15:50,243 --> 01:15:54,425
No, I'm kind of burned out because.

878
01:15:55,623 --> 01:15:57,243
It's been a long, long month.

879
01:15:58,464 --> 01:16:00,424
And yesterday I had to go sing.

880
01:16:00,504 --> 01:16:03,084
So I've sing for like six hours.

881
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:07,885
So I'm tired, need a vacation.

882
01:16:10,046 --> 01:16:12,906
Brenda, how was, I have one last question.

883
01:16:12,926 --> 01:16:13,466
Sorry, guys.

884
01:16:14,427 --> 01:16:17,027
How was the success with the flyers?

885
01:16:17,927 --> 01:16:20,068
Did you wind up giving it out to people?

886
01:16:20,088 --> 01:16:21,928
Did they understand the flyer?

887
01:16:23,247 --> 01:16:25,589
We had a lot of people take the flyers.

888
01:16:25,709 --> 01:16:29,954
We had a few people stop and talk to us about it.

889
01:16:30,314 --> 01:16:34,578
We had one person sign up right there, talking to me about it.

890
01:16:34,978 --> 01:16:37,161
And I said, oh, I can just do it on my phone right now.

891
01:16:38,722 --> 01:16:38,922
Yep.

892
01:16:40,544 --> 01:16:41,645
OK, that's cool.

893
01:16:41,665 --> 01:16:43,367
Good to know.

894
01:16:44,492 --> 01:16:49,256
It was nice because we had Immacula and Zila there.

895
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:50,376
Right.

896
01:16:50,957 --> 01:16:53,979
About electrifying effort because they're two of our coaches.

897
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:56,621
OK, great, great.

898
01:16:58,262 --> 01:16:58,643
Awesome.

899
01:16:59,463 --> 01:16:59,944
Thank you.

900
01:17:06,108 --> 01:17:08,250
Oh, was I supposed to close out or something?

901
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:09,911
What did I say?

902
01:17:10,491 --> 01:17:10,812
Nay.

903
01:17:12,093 --> 01:17:12,775
Hi.

904
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:15,499
Oh, I'm sorry.

905
01:17:15,519 --> 01:17:21,709
Natasha, get some sleep, girl.

906
01:17:21,849 --> 01:17:22,390
All right.

907
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:23,712
Get some sleep.

908
01:17:25,996 --> 01:17:26,476
All right.

909
01:17:26,617 --> 01:17:27,518
Good night, guys.

910
01:17:27,778 --> 01:17:28,980
Feel better, Natasha.

911
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:29,922
Feel better, Brenda.

912
01:17:30,262 --> 01:17:30,743
Thank you.

913
01:17:30,763 --> 01:17:31,124
Bye.

914
01:17:31,324 --> 01:17:32,867
Good night, guys.
