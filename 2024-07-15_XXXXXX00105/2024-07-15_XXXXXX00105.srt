1
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
[SPEAKER_03]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:43,433
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, thank you so much for being with me today.

10
00:00:43,473 --> 00:00:48,758
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't mind just introducing yourself by saying your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:56,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Laura O'Neill, she, her, and I am the executive director of the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

12
00:00:57,825 --> 00:00:58,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Laura.

13
00:00:58,645 --> 00:01:08,073
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just ask you, this might be a controversial question as somebody so involved with the chamber, but if you could share what your favorite place to eat is in Medford and what you like to eat there.

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:18,904
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is such a loaded question, given that we have so many great restaurants who are members of the chamber and also just in Medford.

15
00:01:19,784 --> 00:01:26,907
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that one of the great things about my job is I am paid to go to different places and recruit them.

16
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:31,749
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives me an opportunity to try a lot of different places in Medford.

17
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,370
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way for me to spend my lunch money.

18
00:01:36,562 --> 00:01:41,045
[SPEAKER_00]: This is tough, but I am from Medford.

19
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:41,925
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Medford High.

20
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:42,946
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a Medford High grad.

21
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:52,031
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I want to bring stuff home to my family, I'm like a Bob's half chicken parm, half meatball, because I feel like I cooked a lot of food.

22
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:58,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I also introduced them to the La Cache's Italian sub, because even though I'm O'Neal, I'm 100% Italian.

23
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:02,277
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I get my Italian fix here, but also,

24
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:06,300
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm trying like our offices in Medford Square.

25
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:09,384
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm a big fan of.

26
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:21,498
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a salad at deep cuts that has garbanzo meatballs and I am obviously not a vegetarian, based on what I just told you but it is, that's probably my go to lunch.

27
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:24,169
[SPEAKER_00]: or a protein smoothie.

28
00:02:24,529 --> 00:02:26,130
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big Allegria.

29
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,832
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite South Medford places has a great protein smoothie.

30
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:35,997
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of my, those are my places I frequent, but there's just no shortage of great places.

31
00:02:37,098 --> 00:02:41,980
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first moved here, I worked with somebody from Medford, and she brought over lakashas.

32
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,222
[SPEAKER_04]: The pizza was like a Sicilian-style pizza, I think they call it.

33
00:02:46,362 --> 00:02:47,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And she grew up in Medford.

34
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:49,383
[SPEAKER_04]: She was like, this is the best pizza.

35
00:02:49,943 --> 00:02:56,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like sometimes there's conversations about best pizza in Medford, and it gets pretty heated.

36
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:57,266
[SPEAKER_04]: But that was a good pizza.

37
00:02:58,006 --> 00:02:59,288
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our swim meet pizza.

38
00:02:59,668 --> 00:03:07,659
[SPEAKER_00]: We had our swim meets at Medford High and the square pizza like I forever associated with that like that's my, my thing about that.

39
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:14,067
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I will say now that I'm in Medford Square for pizza, I just, I sort of, that's my thin pizza.

40
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:17,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's, I feel some controversy.

41
00:03:17,154 --> 00:03:24,903
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like their pizza, poor pizza, but I feel like they, it's marketed as like a South Shore bar pizza, which I have a little bit more shore person.

42
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:30,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of feelings about pizza, but I just, we just eat whatever our kids will eat.

43
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,032
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, that limits us a little bit.

44
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:45,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so you as the executive director of the Chamber of Commerce, I wonder if you could just tell us, like for folks who don't know, which it does include me, what the Chamber is, what it does, yeah, what we need to know about it.

45
00:03:46,776 --> 00:03:47,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

46
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:52,120
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something I do on a daily basis, is letting people know what a chamber is.

47
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,682
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been around for years.

48
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:58,565
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're over 60 years old, the Medford Chamber.

49
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:03,429
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of history, but it's a membership organization.

50
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:05,310
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are a not-for-profit.

51
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:09,613
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal of a chamber is to

52
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:19,045
[SPEAKER_00]: amplify and represent the voices of the business community and it's also to provide support to the business community.

53
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:30,187
[SPEAKER_00]: going with the framework that, you know, the more businesses that are in Medford, the more successful they are, it's a better environment for the people who live here.

54
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:38,291
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also a nice place that attracts good employees for the people who are working here.

55
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:44,354
[SPEAKER_00]: So our overall goal is to support businesses the best way we can.

56
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:49,237
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the issues with the chamber is you're gonna have a lot of different

57
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:56,057
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses, right, and you have a lot of different things that help one may actually be detrimental to another.

58
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:59,943
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not pushing any certain policies.

59
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:09,739
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just working to make it as business friendly as possible and also to really connect businesses.

60
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,160
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the most fun parts of my job.

61
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to be like, wait, you're having this issue.

62
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:20,982
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this business who's actually in your city that can probably help you.

63
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:23,863
[SPEAKER_00]: So connecting businesses is a big part of what we do.

64
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:33,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just basically, we also do some community events to make sure that Medford residents know all that is in the city.

65
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

66
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:43,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And so could you be a little bit more specific about, like, if when members join the chamber, like, what are the benefits to them?

67
00:05:44,364 --> 00:05:44,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

68
00:05:45,165 --> 00:05:57,301
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I recently just did like a flip on that question, instead of like what the chamber does for the business, sort of showing what being part of the chamber does for everyone.

69
00:05:57,562 --> 00:05:59,344
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you come in and you're a law firm.

70
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:07,363
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna give us the professional services that may be really useful for other members, right?

71
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:15,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are looking for maybe succession planning in their business, personal representation, a variety of issues.

72
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:21,488
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna hopefully find more business, so that will help grow their business.

73
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,789
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, networking is a large part of the chamber.

74
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:28,752
[SPEAKER_00]: but also they're gonna be able to educate the other members.

75
00:06:29,272 --> 00:06:39,800
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the larger our base of businesses is and the more variety we have, the better chamber we can be.

76
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:44,344
[SPEAKER_00]: So really by a business joining the chamber, you're helping us grow.

77
00:06:45,184 --> 00:06:48,367
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stronger we are, hopefully that translate

78
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:55,840
[SPEAKER_00]: into more traction in Medford, better representation outside of the city.

79
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:02,441
[SPEAKER_00]: I do go to as much as I can, you know, small business administration events.

80
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:09,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to advise you regarding for smaller businesses, what supports available.

81
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:14,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a lot of grants for new businesses, but sometimes they don't know about them.

82
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:18,505
[SPEAKER_00]: So small business organizations target a chamber,

83
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:21,794
[SPEAKER_00]: as we have the boots on the ground, right?

84
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:27,398
[SPEAKER_00]: But I need to have those people as part of our chamber so that I can connect them.

85
00:07:27,578 --> 00:07:32,242
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a little bit of a contrast at times, right?

86
00:07:32,302 --> 00:07:37,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm trying to get the small businesses to join, but for them, it's a big outlay.

87
00:07:37,966 --> 00:07:39,988
[SPEAKER_00]: Our entry membership for your first year is $100.

88
00:07:40,028 --> 00:07:46,773
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a large amount of money, but when you add up all your costs, when you're opening a new business,

89
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:50,506
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be something you're not ready to take on.

90
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,992
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really try to work with that.

91
00:07:54,488 --> 00:08:01,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I've seen like, like, different events that the chamber puts on, like in the square, there's like, always like, different businesses represented there.

92
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:04,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And I imagine that's part of like, how you help promote them.

93
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:22,830
[SPEAKER_04]: But sounds like what you're describing is kind of like, I think of like a professional organization, like, you're kind of bringing in the like, sort of common thread, there's all these small businesses that are local to Medford, and kind of helping them connect with each other, even if they're not in the same type of business, they're all sort of like Medford based small businesses.

94
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:31,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, and I can tell you, this is a story, and I love these stories, when you find these businesses who aren't related, right?

95
00:08:31,475 --> 00:08:44,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not as basic as the basic needs that every business needs, insurance, and stuff like that, social media, like going beyond your marketing, your insurance, because there are things that every business has in common, right?

96
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:48,278
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're a bakery, or a cleaning service,

97
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:50,078
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain things, or a hairdresser.

98
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:51,499
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain things that everybody needs.

99
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,299
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have that issue where people relate.

100
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:56,700
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also an issue of growth.

101
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,960
[SPEAKER_00]: As people go to expand, they have common issues.

102
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:06,942
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not going with expansion, but connecting members.

103
00:09:07,302 --> 00:09:13,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Boston Glory is a great Medford team who I've been really excited to work with.

104
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:22,969
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were at our banquet and I sat them with Paige Aesthetics, which is a beauty business in the hillside.

105
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:30,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I knew those two owners had similar mindsets and I thought they would really enjoy each other during the banquet.

106
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they connected on something totally different.

107
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:41,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Boston Glory needed to provide showers to a team that was visiting and they don't have showers at Hormel.

108
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:56,488
[SPEAKER_00]: So this beauty business worked with them and they used a local gym, they ended up going to Planet Fitness and working it all out and she made that connections for glory, and she made those connections because they had met at a chamber event.

109
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:00,051
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, stuff like that, I can't.

110
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:01,763
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't script.

111
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:08,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't know that those two would hit it off and a month later they would need each other on something so random.

112
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,567
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love when that happens.

113
00:10:11,347 --> 00:10:12,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it is more traditional.

114
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:19,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know certain businesses, I'm like, if you connect with them, this is gonna be a great partnership.

115
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:24,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Ron Medford, I love working with Dave McGilvery.

116
00:10:24,752 --> 00:10:27,653
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a fan of his, so that's a very, it's a great perk of my job.

117
00:10:29,492 --> 00:10:32,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to connect him with Blink Fitness.

118
00:10:32,893 --> 00:10:39,736
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a smaller gym, they're the owner in Medford, and Blink has great social media.

119
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:48,760
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting those two companies together, obviously it's a race, so he's going after the fitness membership.

120
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,142
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was an easy connect, but it's something that, you know,

121
00:10:54,304 --> 00:10:59,825
[SPEAKER_00]: it needed the chamber because Dave, you know, he doesn't know every gym in Medford.

122
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:05,426
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we were able to bring in the other gyms, like F45 also participated.

123
00:11:05,486 --> 00:11:15,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not, even people in the same industry on large scale events, it's been great to see how the businesses work together, right?

124
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:17,948
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going after different audiences.

125
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:22,949
[SPEAKER_00]: When Reimagine just opened up again after COVID, like,

126
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:26,730
[SPEAKER_00]: they were so great also coming to events like this.

127
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,332
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just been great to see the small businesses all working together.

128
00:11:31,632 --> 00:11:32,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does.

129
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:39,516
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one thing that I've taken away from talking to so many people on the podcast is that sometimes connecting is an issue in Medford.

130
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:48,940
[SPEAKER_04]: We have all these great things and like you said, people could be doing something similar or could be doing something that complements each other, but they don't know each other.

131
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,242
[SPEAKER_04]: So being able to connect through the chamber sounds like a really helpful resource.

132
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:59,496
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, you know, networking in these connections is one of the biggest part of our job.

133
00:12:01,537 --> 00:12:05,399
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just helps, if people are members, I know more about them.

134
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:06,820
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to reach them.

135
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:17,425
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are times when I can do a math email saying, does anyone, you know, looking for something, we also, there's a hiring, they have their own membership portal where they can post jobs.

136
00:12:18,226 --> 00:12:19,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, just because,

137
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:29,196
[SPEAKER_00]: One place was looking for a kitchen designer right so you don't know who knows a kitchen designer I may be a bakery but hey my roommate.

138
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:35,163
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a designer so it's its own internal network that we really want to maximize.

139
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:38,567
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one problem is if you're not a member.

140
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:40,268
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have your email.

141
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:55,856
[SPEAKER_00]: And as much as membership is a cost, I really think that it's a benefit because you're getting the knowledge of not just what I know, but mainly what my other businesses feed me.

142
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:58,938
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger businesses like our banks,

143
00:12:59,997 --> 00:13:04,638
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they run some amazing programs that are available to all businesses.

144
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:08,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sort of have the same issue with me, right?

145
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,021
[SPEAKER_00]: They pump it out to their clients, but the other people don't know about it.

146
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:19,883
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they pump out information via the chamber, it gets to all business owners so they can see what's available.

147
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:22,563
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds really helpful.

148
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:29,348
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder, like I know like development is a big conversation in Medford, like kind of different businesses coming in, how we support that.

149
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:40,356
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder as somebody who kind of has their finger on the pulse of like all the, a lot of businesses in Medford, if there's any like type of business that you want to see more of in Medford or want to see come to Medford?

150
00:13:41,437 --> 00:13:42,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I get this a lot.

151
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,741
[SPEAKER_00]: And people tell me a lot what they want to see.

152
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:49,223
[SPEAKER_00]: More independent retail stores.

153
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:50,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

154
00:13:50,879 --> 00:14:02,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I'm a big fan of for good vibes because they have some great Medford gear that I always try to bring to events that I am also someone who shops a lot.

155
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,726
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know,

156
00:14:06,227 --> 00:14:20,138
[SPEAKER_00]: I work above Roland's which is great at the holidays I, you know, I think my children are very lucky to have me working there for their graduation gifts, and other occasions, but I'd love to see some smaller retail.

157
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:38,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I had went to the south end their market and I had met a shoe owner and you know she had these amazing shoes and she's like oh we were looking at Medford so like when I hear that I pounce on people and and try to help them get into Medford.

158
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,561
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we do that the West method open studios.

159
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:53,983
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some great getting, you know, the farmer's market has smaller businesses that hopefully right if they find success there that they like Trove started at the farmer's market, right?

160
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:58,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly that they they open up a store.

161
00:14:58,444 --> 00:14:58,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

162
00:14:59,705 --> 00:15:00,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but we

163
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:15,984
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do, I do work, we are not part of the city organization, but I do meet with Sal DiStefano, the new economic development director, I meet with him, I meet with Lisa Coliani.

164
00:15:16,632 --> 00:15:32,009
[SPEAKER_00]: just to try to see like what calls is he getting you know he'll refer people to me vice versa so it is nice to be able to have that relationship with them to be like oh you you got that too like all right how can we try to help this business yeah

165
00:15:33,163 --> 00:15:37,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I really love Real Guso in the square, but I really miss the bookstore that was there before.

166
00:15:37,506 --> 00:15:38,747
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna give a little catch up.

167
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:45,331
[SPEAKER_00]: I would travel, I had moved out of Medford by then, and I would travel to get my coffee and book there.

168
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:49,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I agree with you, another bookstore would be great.

169
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:56,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and as I said, you mentioned sort of like connection to sort of city government.

170
00:15:56,418 --> 00:16:02,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder like what support you have from the city or if you think there's different ways the city could be supportive to the chamber?

171
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:08,045
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the city is very supportive of the chamber with their time.

172
00:16:09,366 --> 00:16:12,308
[SPEAKER_00]: We are trying to figure out financial.

173
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:17,912
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be like something we want to explore together is a tourism component.

174
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:32,443
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Bedford has a lot of history, and Lexington and Arlington, they've done a great job capitalizing on the historic events that have occurred in their cities.

175
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:40,412
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, I think Medford Patriots Day is a great event with a horse in Medford Square going to West Medford.

176
00:16:40,852 --> 00:16:45,273
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think is the best visual to have a horse outside your business.

177
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,973
[SPEAKER_00]: They go right to the Paul Revere restaurant.

178
00:16:47,113 --> 00:16:50,154
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't really make that up.

179
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:51,695
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.

180
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:55,095
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd love to see more tourism in Medford.

181
00:16:56,436 --> 00:17:00,077
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see more business developed along the river.

182
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:10,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I actually grew up in Lexington and we, like I, the, uh, like the Patriots day, like, I never really, like, I knew the marathon happened on that same day, but people would be like, marathon Monday, but no, it's Patriots day.

183
00:17:10,985 --> 00:17:22,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it, like, it was a huge, like going to the parades and like, you know, it would, and like to the all night, like the reenactment, I actually did not know that Medford was part of that until I, until I'd been here for several years.

184
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:31,550
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, yeah, no, it's, it's, uh, and like we, they would have, like, they still probably do have like busloads of people coming in to see all that stuff and like, like the Royal house and.

185
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,532
[SPEAKER_04]: different things that we have in Medford that it sounds like could be more integrated there.

186
00:17:37,153 --> 00:17:38,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we would love to do that.

187
00:17:38,153 --> 00:17:40,054
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Royal House is an amazing organization.

188
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:45,477
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a really good job, but they could get the boost from everyone working together.

189
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:54,062
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I also think is really cool is, so the Isaac Hall House is now the Islamic Cultural Center, and they have embraced Patriots Day.

190
00:17:54,322 --> 00:17:55,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, they open up

191
00:17:56,543 --> 00:18:03,346
[SPEAKER_00]: their place of worship on Patriots Day, honoring, you know, letting people see what happened there.

192
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:04,886
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think that's great.

193
00:18:04,926 --> 00:18:08,047
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we have to continue to try to amplify that event.

194
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:19,292
[SPEAKER_00]: It is tough, because now the marathon has grown, I think, you know, in popularity, but stuff like that, I think we could benefit from a tourism department.

195
00:18:20,492 --> 00:18:22,193
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to work together to get that.

196
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:38,755
[SPEAKER_00]: The city is, they've developed a business resource page and I think that's a great navigating what permits need, people need when they open to expand to do business in Medford.

197
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:44,098
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great they have that resource because I can refer businesses to that.

198
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,862
[SPEAKER_00]: So stuff like that, it's been great having this relationship with them.

199
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:55,908
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if a business owner called me and says, I'm really having a problem, I can try to help them.

200
00:18:57,009 --> 00:19:02,593
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do, we all work together because the city also wants businesses to thrive in Medford.

201
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:10,300
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody, the great thing about working with the city is we have a common goal, right?

202
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,081
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want more business in the city.

203
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:23,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you for that it is it's nice to hear that there's that they are like you know generous with their time and also there's some other goals in your mind that sound exciting.

204
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:28,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if there's any like events this summer that you want to promote or things that we can expect to see from the Chamber.

205
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:30,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

206
00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:36,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Our biggest event is Oktoberfest, and it happens in Medford Square.

207
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:37,675
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been happening for a long time.

208
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:44,922
[SPEAKER_00]: What's fantastic is we have a real ballerina German band that is fantastic.

209
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:49,906
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have other music from Garfish, and we'll have a beer garden.

210
00:19:50,937 --> 00:19:54,258
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping this year to bring in more Medford restaurants.

211
00:19:54,858 --> 00:20:00,859
[SPEAKER_00]: We sort of want to make it, as many restaurants as are available that day, we hope, sign up.

212
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:03,040
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just sending out the solicitations now.

213
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:14,283
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make it also like a taste of Medford, you know, so that people can find out about some of the new places that have opened, some of the places they maybe just haven't tried.

214
00:20:15,563 --> 00:20:37,345
[SPEAKER_00]: um you know we have a lot of school um we had the rowing team there last year and they had their erg yeah my kids did my kids tried that i was just really they really enjoyed it yeah which is great and like the fact that methodi has a rowing team i think it's fantastic and that people should learn about so hopefully they'll be back there's the smokehouse by the fire department

215
00:20:38,646 --> 00:20:40,268
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a great community event.

216
00:20:40,588 --> 00:20:43,651
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know sometimes it'd be like, okay, well, what does that do for businesses?

217
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:44,792
[SPEAKER_00]: That does a lot.

218
00:20:45,593 --> 00:20:53,321
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, number one, it provides entertainment, so that if you're a young employee, and you just moved to Medford, this is a great event.

219
00:20:53,581 --> 00:20:57,244
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we want to keep you here so that you work in these businesses.

220
00:20:59,006 --> 00:21:00,688
[SPEAKER_00]: It also gives businesses

221
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:04,183
[SPEAKER_00]: more a different audience, right?

222
00:21:04,303 --> 00:21:09,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of someone walking into their store, hopefully they see them in Medford Square and then go visit them.

223
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:12,025
[SPEAKER_00]: We really like this event.

224
00:21:13,465 --> 00:21:17,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Tina Caruso is on our board and she's been chairing this event for years.

225
00:21:17,246 --> 00:21:18,366
[SPEAKER_00]: She's with Brookline Bank.

226
00:21:18,927 --> 00:21:20,467
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been a sponsor of the event.

227
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:25,848
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a longstanding event that we continue to improve and add as times change.

228
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:27,469
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding a pet parade.

229
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:34,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, because I mean, I'm a dog owner, so I'm a little biased, but everybody loves Halloween costumes for their pets.

230
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

231
00:21:35,596 --> 00:21:38,638
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to, you know, hit that last year.

232
00:21:38,718 --> 00:21:41,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I remember seeing a lot of dogs in costumes last year, too.

233
00:21:41,896 --> 00:21:43,317
[SPEAKER_00]: I rolled it out last year.

234
00:21:44,318 --> 00:21:59,688
[SPEAKER_00]: It started, it was, you know, like any new thing, it had a little, some hiccups, but I did get, you know, talk about support, pet supplies, you know, supplied me with so many items for that event to help launch it.

235
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:06,113
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great in this community when you go into a business and they're like, sure, here you go, we want this to happen.

236
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,794
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, you know, Medford is,

237
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:13,216
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, you know, it's big and small to me, right?

238
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:21,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we have some big box stores here, we have Dick's, we have Target's, you know, we have Wegman's, we have Whole Foods.

239
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:22,800
[SPEAKER_00]: BJ's.

240
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, BJ's.

241
00:22:25,921 --> 00:22:27,101
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some large stores.

242
00:22:27,581 --> 00:22:29,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you mix that in with your smallest stores.

243
00:22:29,822 --> 00:22:31,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think we're a great mix.

244
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:38,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we were like really excited when the Wegmans came and like, and I feel like that's a good draw from other cities too, right?

245
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:42,317
[SPEAKER_04]: For in terms of like getting business and the target we were excited about.

246
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:43,658
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.

247
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:46,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And there, you know, Wegmans is a great supporter.

248
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:47,942
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they helped me in October fest.

249
00:22:47,962 --> 00:22:50,664
[SPEAKER_00]: I get all my flowers, you know, they donate their flowers.

250
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:55,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we have some great community partners here, which helps.

251
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:56,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

252
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

253
00:22:57,948 --> 00:22:59,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, so yeah, we'll look forward to Oktoberfest.

254
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:01,949
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you want to mention you.

255
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,930
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you.

256
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,431
[SPEAKER_00]: So West Medford Square is doing a movie night and playstead park.

257
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:11,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so that we're excited for that that's happening in July, July 24.

258
00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:21,178
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to try on a smaller scale, West Medford is rolling out a taste of West Medford, just for West Medford.

259
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:25,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully if that goes well there, like other squares would do it.

260
00:23:27,902 --> 00:23:28,842
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be great.

261
00:23:29,422 --> 00:23:29,603
[SPEAKER_00]: So,

262
00:23:30,773 --> 00:23:31,974
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are our main events.

263
00:23:32,575 --> 00:23:41,223
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that I offer for the businesses is in this position, I meet with other chambers of commerce and we have a multi-chamber.

264
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:54,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm able to offer the business owners who are members access to these events outside of Medford so that we, so that you can, you know,

265
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:58,901
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of time their customer base is broader than just Medford.

266
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:03,505
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing a comedy night on Route 1 at Giggles there.

267
00:24:05,087 --> 00:24:09,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have like a golf night over at Birdie Bar in Waltham.

268
00:24:10,091 --> 00:24:15,316
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for business owners who are into golf, hopefully we can get them to attend that.

269
00:24:16,357 --> 00:24:20,601
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing we are planning is we're hoping to launch a fashion show.

270
00:24:22,422 --> 00:24:24,706
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done that before.

271
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:30,514
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a board member, Maria Fabiano, who is spearheading this.

272
00:24:30,975 --> 00:24:34,159
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the preliminary stages, but we're looking to launch it in November.

273
00:24:34,882 --> 00:24:38,445
[SPEAKER_04]: So a fashion show would be like local, like clothes makers or how would that?

274
00:24:38,765 --> 00:24:43,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we're gonna, boutiques from, that would be a multi-chamber.

275
00:24:43,629 --> 00:24:48,193
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna hit, you know, Arlington, Melrose, Winchester boutiques.

276
00:24:48,633 --> 00:24:51,295
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna get some of the yoga studios here in Medford.

277
00:24:51,836 --> 00:24:52,676
[SPEAKER_00]: They have clothing.

278
00:24:52,696 --> 00:24:53,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

279
00:24:53,817 --> 00:24:55,859
[SPEAKER_00]: So reach out to our local yoga studios.

280
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do have any independent, you know, we call it non-brick and mortar, right?

281
00:25:01,444 --> 00:25:02,705
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't got a storefront yet.

282
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:14,166
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the hardest people for me to reach, but if I could reach them, I would love to have an independent designer showcase their work.

283
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:19,169
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping a fashion show would generate some interest, something different, something we haven't done.

284
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,691
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're always trying new events.

285
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:31,517
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as for our members, we also do like a networking coffee, just come in for an hour and meet different people.

286
00:25:32,655 --> 00:25:34,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, exciting, yeah.

287
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:37,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems like a fun group to be a part of.

288
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:43,181
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have not-for-profits, so I should mention that.

289
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:49,345
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford has some amazing not-for-profits, and they join the chamber at a discounted rate.

290
00:25:50,346 --> 00:25:57,190
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things we also try to do is, Raising Cane, when they came in, they said to me,

291
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:00,493
[SPEAKER_00]: we're very big at giving back.

292
00:26:00,513 --> 00:26:02,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me a list of who's in your community?

293
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:05,057
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing we do.

294
00:26:05,117 --> 00:26:10,701
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we wanna introduce for-profit to the not-for-profit sector.

295
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:16,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just more of a, again, providing information.

296
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:23,210
[SPEAKER_04]: So it seems like we can direct a lot of questions to you if people have businesses in Medford.

297
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:24,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.

298
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:26,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else that you wanna mention before we wrap up today?

299
00:26:27,978 --> 00:26:35,763
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to say that we are a membership-based organization, as I said, but also our board is really important.

300
00:26:36,924 --> 00:26:39,765
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some dedicated members on our board.

301
00:26:40,146 --> 00:26:46,350
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, our president is Andrew Mather from the Chevalier, and he's had some great new ideas.

302
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,251
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been excellent rolling those out with him.

303
00:26:49,719 --> 00:26:52,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, our president was Rocco DiRico from Tufts.

304
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, again, such an amazing opportunity to be able to work with him.

305
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:01,884
[SPEAKER_00]: So the chamber board members are so dedicated.

306
00:27:01,904 --> 00:27:03,805
[SPEAKER_00]: They help this organization thrive.

307
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:06,927
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always looking for new board members.

308
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:15,831
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in Medford and you think you're ready to give more and you don't know how, joining our board is a great way.

309
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:17,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you don't want to start with the board, we have committees.

310
00:27:19,332 --> 00:27:27,055
[SPEAKER_00]: So people often think, I guess, when they join the chamber that they have to attend meetings and have to do something.

311
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:29,756
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the case, right?

312
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:30,877
[SPEAKER_00]: It's optional.

313
00:27:31,277 --> 00:27:36,239
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are able to share your talent and your time, we'll take them.

314
00:27:36,859 --> 00:27:43,902
[SPEAKER_00]: If right now you are so busy that you're trying to work, you know, you're the cook and you're the cleaner at the same time.

315
00:27:44,022 --> 00:27:45,043
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are too busy,

316
00:27:46,043 --> 00:27:49,004
[SPEAKER_00]: I want members to look at me as like just promoting you.

317
00:27:49,604 --> 00:27:52,226
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna to put you out there.

318
00:27:52,846 --> 00:27:56,287
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're ready to give something back, I'll take it.

319
00:27:57,508 --> 00:27:59,248
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of my main message.

320
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:00,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's nice.

321
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:04,470
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like you can be a member at whatever sort of intensity that you want.

322
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:10,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there's not a lot of time that you have to like, engage with the chamber, there's still an opportunity to be promoted by the chamber.

323
00:28:12,411 --> 00:28:13,712
[SPEAKER_00]: That is exactly correct.

324
00:28:13,812 --> 00:28:18,975
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when you play that back, I am gonna use that on one of my taglines.

325
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:23,997
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we do do is I issue a newsletter every Thursday.

326
00:28:24,237 --> 00:28:29,660
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really our biggest way to connect with members and the community.

327
00:28:29,981 --> 00:28:33,102
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone's interested, the newsletter is a good place.

328
00:28:33,502 --> 00:28:34,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Also our website.

329
00:28:35,443 --> 00:28:41,847
[SPEAKER_00]: Our website does list events and our website has a directory that lists every chamber member.

330
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we can put that in our show notes for people too.

331
00:28:45,001 --> 00:28:48,386
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, how would they how would people get like subscribe to the newsletter?

332
00:28:49,407 --> 00:28:51,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can send me an email.

333
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:51,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

334
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:55,933
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also there's a link to register on our website website.

335
00:28:55,993 --> 00:28:56,313
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

336
00:28:56,493 --> 00:28:57,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll put that in the show notes.

337
00:28:58,234 --> 00:28:59,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you so much.

338
00:28:59,134 --> 00:29:00,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this was really informative.

339
00:29:00,434 --> 00:29:05,036
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say like, they're like, I answered a lot of my questions about what the chamber does.

340
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:05,697
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

341
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:13,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, Danielle, for giving me the opportunity, because, you know, reaching new audiences is something that we really want to do.

342
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,081
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was very happy that you

343
00:29:16,117 --> 00:29:17,978
[SPEAKER_00]: took the time to talk to me.

344
00:29:18,178 --> 00:29:22,560
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I will say we started this because we did an art walk.

345
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,001
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to mention the art walk.

346
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:27,462
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked with Art Medford on that, who was fantastic.

347
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:31,004
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and they introduced me, you know, reintroduced me to you.

348
00:29:31,544 --> 00:29:34,866
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the chamber takes advantage of these partnerships also.

349
00:29:34,886 --> 00:29:35,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

350
00:29:35,826 --> 00:29:36,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

351
00:29:36,067 --> 00:29:36,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

352
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:42,710
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, unfortunately we didn't get this, we didn't get together in time to promote the art walk, but maybe next year we can, we can get ahead of it.

353
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:44,717
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be doing it again.

354
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:47,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all the businesses and artists who participated.

355
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:49,863
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be back and we will have more time.

356
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:50,544
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

357
00:29:50,564 --> 00:29:51,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

358
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:52,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much.

359
00:29:52,867 --> 00:29:53,127
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

360
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:03,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for listening to today's episode.
