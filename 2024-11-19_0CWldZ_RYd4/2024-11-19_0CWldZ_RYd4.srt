111
00:05:53,713 --> 00:05:53,994

125
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief, you want to give us a brief synopsis?

126
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:05,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

127
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:11,735
[SPEAKER_12]: First, let me thank you all, Mr. President and Council Councilors for having me this evening.

128
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:21,039
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll begin with our lease agreement for the two ladder trucks has been signed last week.

129
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:24,481
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is a

130
00:07:26,563 --> 00:07:27,444
[SPEAKER_12]: one step forward.

131
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:38,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully, in mid to end of May, we will be traveling to Wisconsin to do a final inspection on both of those ladder trucks.

132
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:44,894
[SPEAKER_12]: and hopefully take delivery probably hopefully by the 1st of June.

133
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:57,778
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm keeping my fingers crossed as you know with COVID the plant out in Wisconsin was shut down numerous times and everything is behind schedule.

134
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:03,940
[SPEAKER_12]: We're hoping to get these two ladder trucks at Christmas time and then it got moved to February

135
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,081
[SPEAKER_12]: And now we're at the mid to the end of May.

136
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:13,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully that's the last delay, but I can't guarantee that.

137
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:16,543
[SPEAKER_12]: But I did get some pictures updated.

138
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:18,544
[SPEAKER_12]: Every once in a while, they send some pictures.

139
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:22,405
[SPEAKER_12]: So they are making progress with the two ladder trucks.

140
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:28,307
[SPEAKER_12]: We have recently taken delivery of a new utility truck.

141
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:37,202
[SPEAKER_12]: with a eight foot plow and a hydraulic lift gate that was delivered a few weeks ago.

142
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:39,823
[SPEAKER_12]: We're still in the process of fitting it.

143
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:42,043
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had the lettering done.

144
00:08:42,944 --> 00:08:50,485
[SPEAKER_12]: We're waiting to get all the emergency lights and then we can install those and then install the radio and have that service available.

145
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,906
[SPEAKER_12]: The task force report,

146
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:59,455
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe you all have had a copy of that.

147
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:10,622
[SPEAKER_12]: We have started some work on some of the outside stations, in particular, some of the roof works, roof leaks, things of that nature.

148
00:09:10,662 --> 00:09:12,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the small stuff we're trying to get knocked off.

149
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:15,706
[SPEAKER_12]: The roof at engine two has been repaired.

150
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,989
[SPEAKER_12]: We are in the process of getting it fixed.

151
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:32,056
[SPEAKER_12]: getting quotes and advertising to put in three new kitchens, engine two, engine five, and engine six.

152
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:36,839
[SPEAKER_12]: But engine six is right now on the back burner until we get the roof replaced.

153
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,720
[SPEAKER_12]: That station needs a whole new roof.

154
00:09:43,682 --> 00:09:44,263
[SPEAKER_12]: New hires.

155
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:46,584
[SPEAKER_12]: We are in the process.

156
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:48,385
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that process has begun.

157
00:09:48,565 --> 00:09:54,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully we will be putting some new candidates on the department.

158
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:58,728
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have some retirements coming up this year.

159
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:04,429
[SPEAKER_12]: By the end of the year, there'll be another additional five, I believe.

160
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:11,411
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's about it as far as what's happening.

161
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:13,612
[SPEAKER_12]: If I have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.

162
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:16,754
[SPEAKER_14]: questions for the chief.

163
00:10:18,895 --> 00:10:19,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

164
00:10:20,856 --> 00:10:21,256
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Chief.

165
00:10:21,656 --> 00:10:22,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for being here this evening.

166
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:23,577
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

167
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:24,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

168
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:24,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Good to see you.

169
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:38,643
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that the reason why we've done this is really to get ahead of not really looking at the budget concerns, but just ask questions to get us caught up to date with some of the concerns and issues that we might have

170
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:42,898
[SPEAKER_14]: had in prior years before we get to the budget.

171
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have candidates for the academy right now?

172
00:10:48,662 --> 00:10:54,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we always had trouble finding spots in the academy to fill these retirements.

173
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:55,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we going to be okay with that?

174
00:10:57,798 --> 00:11:05,703
[SPEAKER_12]: The last report I received from the academy is they did have openings for the August class.

175
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:09,245
[SPEAKER_12]: However, they're probably filled by now.

176
00:11:09,845 --> 00:11:19,971
[SPEAKER_12]: The new list, the new certification for the firefighters entry level was established on March 15th, so it's brand new.

177
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:25,052
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where our candidates will come from.

178
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:38,216
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's, I can't give you a date when they would go into the academy because of that process of hiring them is quite a lengthy and involved process.

179
00:11:38,276 --> 00:11:38,496
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

180
00:11:39,276 --> 00:11:39,617
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

181
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:42,577
[SPEAKER_14]: So what does that leave us with the retirement?

182
00:11:42,597 --> 00:11:47,699
[SPEAKER_14]: So we still, are we going to be in some, we have some issues with staffing or are we okay?

183
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:49,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we're okay.

184
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:56,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't forget, we do have a 23 man minimum per ship, so, which constitutes overtime, so.

185
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:03,581
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, so that's why, so we're hoping to get, are we going to go with just five or are we adding more?

186
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:06,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know if there's plans to add more than five?

187
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:09,384
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had discussions between five and 10 or so.

188
00:12:09,404 --> 00:12:10,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

189
00:12:10,784 --> 00:12:10,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

190
00:12:11,825 --> 00:12:12,525
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

191
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:17,427
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that the patch had that we started some,

192
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:21,105
[SPEAKER_14]: capital improvements for the fire department.

193
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,829
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, the mayor had a story.

194
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:23,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Does this mean that, um,

195
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:27,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this what you were speaking of earlier, the roofs, is that part of that?

196
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:35,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yes, there's a whole, each and every station, the task force, and the task force began in October of 2020.

197
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:48,348
[SPEAKER_12]: We met for six months, weekly, and then we came up with, everybody in the department practically was involved with this endeavor.

198
00:12:49,569 --> 00:12:50,850
[SPEAKER_12]: My six deputy chiefs,

199
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:58,073
[SPEAKER_12]: the house captains for each one of the stations, uh, several members of the task force firefighters.

200
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,535
[SPEAKER_12]: And we prioritized from highest priority down to lowest priority.

201
00:13:03,556 --> 00:13:09,079
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um, we have begun some of the work, some of the low hanging fruit, if you will.

202
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:12,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully we will continue to do that.

203
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:16,442
[SPEAKER_12]: And until we have to tackle the bigger, bigger problems.

204
00:13:17,323 --> 00:13:17,583
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

205
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:17,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I

206
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:19,998
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's a lot of bigger problems.

207
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:34,923
[SPEAKER_14]: We took those tours together and we need to put money where our mouth is and go after making sure that our employees in the fire department have everything they need to succeed and live in a safe environment.

208
00:13:34,943 --> 00:13:41,685
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that that's all I have for now, but thank you for being here again, Chief.

209
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:42,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

210
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:54,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief, do you want to go over the mutual aid agreement with us also while you're here?

211
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,426
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a separate resolution.

212
00:13:56,626 --> 00:14:00,407
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a separate paper, so I would add it after this.

213
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:02,327
[SPEAKER_14]: I will add it after this.

214
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:16,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief, I'd like to also, if I can, Mr. President, just thank our men and women from the fire department that joined the city of Somerville in that huge fire this past weekend.

215
00:14:17,782 --> 00:14:18,642
[SPEAKER_14]: and their efforts.

216
00:14:18,843 --> 00:14:27,847
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's, this is what we'll be talking about later, but I wanted to make sure I give a pat on the back for everybody that was involved with that.

217
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,288
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

218
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:29,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

219
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:35,431
[SPEAKER_12]: We have currently have companies over in Everett and Santilly Circle fighting a brush fire.

220
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:36,532
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on the Everett side.

221
00:14:38,553 --> 00:14:39,954
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been there an hour now, I think.

222
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,396
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what they need to do.

223
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:47,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

224
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:49,873
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to thank Chief Gilberti for being on the call.

225
00:14:51,354 --> 00:14:53,755
[SPEAKER_14]: It's taken a couple of weeks to get the chief here.

226
00:14:54,656 --> 00:14:57,938
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard he weighed up and now looking at him, it looks like he was laid up on the beach.

227
00:14:58,838 --> 00:15:01,600
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's all right.

228
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,641
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad to have him here.

229
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:05,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief, if you can answer a question.

230
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:11,986
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor's capital plan talks about looking at the headquarters in year 2024 of her five year plan.

231
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:27,344
[SPEAKER_14]: and the plan that was just submitted from this working group talks about having the fire headquarters be the last and priority, the last station to get any needs done.

232
00:15:27,824 --> 00:15:28,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you just explain that to me?

233
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,486
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's true.

234
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:42,268
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to get these outside stations up to par for the firefighters and

235
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:49,359
[SPEAKER_12]: The headquarters replacement or renovation is going to be a long process.

236
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:59,241
[SPEAKER_12]: The mayor has started to review the past feasibility study.

237
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:04,462
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need to move that along and that's going to take some time.

238
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:08,423
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is no real reason why

239
00:16:11,549 --> 00:16:15,772
[SPEAKER_12]: we went with the outside stations versus headquarters.

240
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:18,053
[SPEAKER_12]: They all need a lot of work.

241
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:23,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Headquarters, the recommendation from the task force was to replace the headquarters building.

242
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:32,424
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know how long, that takes a long, long time to come to fruition from the planning stages through construction.

243
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:39,949
[SPEAKER_14]: So Chief, that's one of my main concerns is that the headquarters, as we all know, was pushed off

244
00:16:40,592 --> 00:16:43,073
[SPEAKER_14]: when we were gonna do a combined police and fire center.

245
00:16:43,554 --> 00:16:46,335
[SPEAKER_14]: And we only ended up moving forward with the police side.

246
00:16:46,976 --> 00:16:50,298
[SPEAKER_14]: And at the time, the headquarters had a lot of immediate needs.

247
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:59,843
[SPEAKER_14]: And now what troubles me is that the mayor's capital plan calls for looking at the headquarters in year, I believe it's four or the five year capital plan.

248
00:17:00,523 --> 00:17:10,369
[SPEAKER_14]: And we all know that who knows what's gonna happen in year 2024, if that will still be the priority of the city, would be other needs that jump ahead of that.

249
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:19,885
[SPEAKER_14]: which I hope is not the case, but it was the case last year when other needs jumped ahead of the headquarters, the fire headquarters.

250
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:33,234
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm concerned now that we're putting off immediate needs with the expectation that in year 2024, we may get a new station, a new headquarters, but that remains unseen.

251
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:34,535
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know that.

252
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:40,079
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're kind of kicking the can down the street once again on the headquarters and, you know,

253
00:17:40,621 --> 00:17:45,562
[SPEAKER_14]: I realize we don't want to put good money after bad money into the headquarters if it's going to be replaced.

254
00:17:46,183 --> 00:18:03,687
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think the immediate needs, Chief, that we saw, the front of the facade that's pulling away from the building, the bathrooms that were in poor condition, as you know, the kitchen that's close to where the apparatus parks and contagions and everything else in the living quarters where these firefighters are.

255
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:09,789
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I think these issues, although they're probably costly, need to be addressed immediately.

256
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:21,864
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm hoping that under your leadership, Chief, that the fire headquarters is not last on the list, but should be first, Mr. Chief.

257
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:25,428
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may, Mr. Councilor Max.

258
00:18:27,546 --> 00:18:31,087
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the points that you touched on with headquarters, they have been addressed.

259
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:34,248
[SPEAKER_12]: The bathrooms, the bathrooms have been addressed.

260
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:38,029
[SPEAKER_12]: The wall pushing away from the building, that has been repaired.

261
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,491
[SPEAKER_12]: As far as the capital plan that's out there, that's not etched in stone.

262
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,452
[SPEAKER_12]: That can be updated.

263
00:18:46,552 --> 00:18:48,092
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a fluid document.

264
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:53,834
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's all based on financial availability and need.

265
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:56,055
[SPEAKER_12]: So whether or not,

266
00:18:58,444 --> 00:19:02,546
[SPEAKER_12]: That's your opinion, whether you're talking about having headquarters go first.

267
00:19:05,848 --> 00:19:07,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, I mean, I can only offer my opinion.

268
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:08,850
[SPEAKER_14]: True.

269
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:18,435
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I'm just concerned where- Headquarters is also part of this, the task force recommendations too.

270
00:19:19,155 --> 00:19:21,717
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a need to do some work here also.

271
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:38,940
[SPEAKER_14]: But from what I read, Chief, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you were gonna take all the fire stations in a phased approach, depending on priorities, and that the headquarters was gonna be the last in the phased approach out of the six fire stations.

272
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that not correct?

273
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:41,781
[SPEAKER_12]: That is correct, yes.

274
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:52,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, so that's what I mean about kicking the can down the street on a building we already know, you know, it was housed where the police department was housed, and in my opinion,

275
00:19:53,341 --> 00:20:02,105
[SPEAKER_14]: was in no better shape than the police department, which we condemned that building more or less and built a new police station.

276
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:03,906
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to put that out there, Chief.

277
00:20:04,626 --> 00:20:08,668
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the brave men and women of the fire department deserve no less.

278
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:18,492
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm glad to see after all these years of the council and residents talking about the condition, as well as the firefighters, the condition of the buildings

279
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:20,747
[SPEAKER_14]: that at least something's being acted upon.

280
00:20:21,548 --> 00:20:23,009
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm pleased to see that.

281
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,013
[SPEAKER_14]: I just hope we're able to get to each building and the needs that they have Chief.

282
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:27,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

283
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:38,065
[SPEAKER_12]: We had, don't forget, as I said earlier, we had a half a dozen of the membership as part of that task force.

284
00:20:39,224 --> 00:20:53,334
[SPEAKER_12]: So everybody, as I said, chipped in, and that was the consensus with the task force to tackle those outside stations first, one by one, and then again, come to headquarters.

285
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:56,196
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

286
00:20:57,597 --> 00:20:58,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Council Member.

287
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:01,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

288
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, Chief, for being with us here tonight.

289
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:07,088
[SPEAKER_03]: And I apologize that it's a little bit late.

290
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:16,194
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a couple of quick questions, three questions that actually, I think you touched upon some of it when Councilor Scott probably was asking me questions.

291
00:21:16,214 --> 00:21:18,315
[SPEAKER_03]: So I apologize if it's a little repetitive.

292
00:21:19,096 --> 00:21:19,876
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.

293
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:21,818
[SPEAKER_03]: How many firefighters do we currently have?

294
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:23,059
[SPEAKER_03]: How many are retiring?

295
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many should we have?

296
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:27,061
[SPEAKER_12]: We currently have 111.

297
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:35,287
[SPEAKER_12]: That leaves us with 13 vacancies right now.

298
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:39,570
[SPEAKER_12]: We were budgeted this current year.

299
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:47,934
[SPEAKER_12]: As you know, we had lost 10 positions, but they have been put back into the budget.

300
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:58,000
[SPEAKER_12]: We have five retirements that will be taking place between June and the end of the year.

301
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,569
[SPEAKER_12]: which would bring us back up to 124.

302
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:13,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And is the 124 is how many we should have?

303
00:22:14,473 --> 00:22:18,235
[SPEAKER_12]: That's how many firefighters we have been budgeted in years past.

304
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:25,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully.

305
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Without getting too detailed because they know it's not a budget meeting.

306
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:32,802
[SPEAKER_03]: How many do you feel we should have?

307
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:50,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, that's a tough question because in my 22 years, I think when I first became chief, we had 135, went down to 128.

308
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,661
[SPEAKER_12]: And now we're at 124.

309
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:59,622
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've been at 124 for quite some time.

310
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:05,665
[SPEAKER_12]: If I could have 200 firefighters, that would be great, but that's an impossibility.

311
00:23:06,545 --> 00:23:12,367
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we get back to that 124 number, we're in good shape.

312
00:23:12,807 --> 00:23:16,789
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, don't forget we have that minimum manning per shift.

313
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:18,230
Okay.

314
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Chief, thank you very much.

315
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:23,692
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you to the men and women of the fire department.

316
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:24,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

317
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:26,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

318
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:28,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have any further questions for the chief?

319
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:30,487
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President?

320
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:31,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

321
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:51,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Just if I could, one recommendation that was made in the most recent report from that ad hoc committee that was set up by the mayor was to provide for a satellite fire station in the Wellington Circle area due to all the recent construction, due to the additional traffic and the nature of getting through that particular area.

322
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:53,751
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, for years,

323
00:23:54,175 --> 00:24:09,104
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a member of this council that brought up that issue back so many years ago, Mr. President, was way ahead of his time, stating that because of the growth in Wellington and the high rises and the need brought that satellite up many years ago.

324
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:17,068
[SPEAKER_14]: And there were many people in the administration that pooh-poohed it at the time, saying it's ridiculous, it's a ridiculous idea and so forth.

325
00:24:17,449 --> 00:24:21,391
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we're seeing that, we're revisiting that now again, Mr. President.

326
00:24:21,691 --> 00:24:22,752
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a recommendation

327
00:24:23,237 --> 00:24:28,961
[SPEAKER_14]: with the chief just mentioned, this committee that was established that is comprised of many firefighters.

328
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:37,646
[SPEAKER_14]: And at the time, it was our colleague, Councilor Penta, that brought up that issue over and over again, Mr. President, and it fell on deaf ears.

329
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:44,411
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to thank my colleague for his insight on that issue and the fact that

330
00:24:45,013 --> 00:24:47,375
[SPEAKER_14]: He was always looking out for the best interest of this community.

331
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:54,219
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe having a satellite in that particular area is in the best interest of everyone that lives in that area, Mr. President.

332
00:24:54,819 --> 00:25:02,123
[SPEAKER_14]: And I look forward to the ultimate recommendations someday of the creation of the satellite.

333
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:02,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

334
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:11,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief, would it be possible to build something in the Wellington area, like in conjunction with Malden, something similar to like Revere did?

335
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:16,519
[SPEAKER_14]: with Malden over by the quarry there?

336
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:18,639
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

337
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:20,800
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not my expertise.

338
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,940
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say no.

339
00:25:25,601 --> 00:25:34,943
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even know how well that Revere Malden twin fire station is working out, to be honest with you.

340
00:25:36,322 --> 00:25:51,214
[SPEAKER_12]: But as far as what Councilor Marks had said, I remember Councilor Penta talking about a satellite station in the Wellington area, but don't forget, it wasn't this administration, okay?

341
00:25:51,675 --> 00:26:01,743
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just gotta say that this mayor has made the repairs and everything that we've done with the task force

342
00:26:02,879 --> 00:26:05,301
[SPEAKER_12]: one of her top priorities, okay?

343
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:13,026
[SPEAKER_12]: And she's even involved in the meetings with us, and she keeps pushing forward and pushing forward.

344
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:15,748
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want you all to know that.

345
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:31,420
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know if it's gonna be a possibility to have a satellite station, but with what's gone on over there and the continued build over there, hotels and apartments,

346
00:26:32,776 --> 00:26:37,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Whether or not there's property over there that we can do that, I don't know.

347
00:26:37,058 --> 00:26:39,459
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, that's not up to me.

348
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,102
[SPEAKER_12]: But I do remember the councilor bringing that up years ago.

349
00:26:46,328 --> 00:26:50,109
[SPEAKER_12]: But that was under a previous administration, not this one.

350
00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:58,970
[SPEAKER_12]: This one's right out front and pushing this forward, these repairs and the renovations of all these stations.

351
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:02,671
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I said, I thanked her.

352
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,111
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't thank her enough for doing what she's done so far.

353
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:06,732
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

354
00:27:08,652 --> 00:27:09,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, if I could.

355
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:15,093
[SPEAKER_14]: My comment wasn't directed at any particular administration.

356
00:27:15,646 --> 00:27:28,272
[SPEAKER_14]: It was directed at a need and a concern that was brought up by a member of this city council that we're finally seeing be called and said, you know, saying that there's legitimacy to it and there's a need for it in the community.

357
00:27:28,532 --> 00:27:29,973
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the only reason why I brought it up.

358
00:27:30,594 --> 00:27:36,857
[SPEAKER_14]: Regarding land in Wellington Circle, we know that's like a hen's tooth trying to get land in Wellington Circle.

359
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:54,715
[SPEAKER_14]: What it is is when we have development coming in, a public-private partnership to say, hey, it's great to build here, but we're going to look for you to put a small satellite that we can house a small fire engine and department in there to make sure we maintain the safety.

360
00:27:55,155 --> 00:27:57,216
[SPEAKER_14]: This is how we have to get creative, Mr. President.

361
00:27:57,496 --> 00:27:59,897
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going out and looking for the city to buy land.

362
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:05,759
[SPEAKER_14]: It's creating these public-private partnerships to accomplish what our goals are as a community.

363
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:06,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

364
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:08,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Martins.

365
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:10,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further questions for the Chief?

366
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:17,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, hearing and seeing none, we have a motion on the floor to receive and place on file.

367
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Receive and place on file.

368
00:28:20,022 --> 00:28:22,764
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a motion by Councilor Scott Perry to receive and place on file.

369
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:24,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Vice President Knight.

370
00:28:24,125 --> 00:28:25,826
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

371
00:28:28,868 --> 00:28:29,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief, don't leave.

372
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:31,750
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I'm not going anywhere.

373
00:28:32,371 --> 00:28:32,671
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

374
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:34,933
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just to receive and place on file.

375
00:28:34,953 --> 00:28:36,714
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been locked here for all day.

376
00:28:38,015 --> 00:28:38,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

377
00:28:39,376 --> 00:28:39,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

378
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:41,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Fevella.

379
00:28:41,697 --> 00:28:41,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

380
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:43,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

381
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:43,419
Yes.

382
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:44,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

383
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:45,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

384
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

385
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:46,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

386
00:28:47,842 --> 00:28:48,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

387
00:28:48,722 --> 00:28:49,002
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

388
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:50,123
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello.

389
00:28:50,323 --> 00:28:52,545
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative, motion passes.

390
00:28:53,545 --> 00:28:57,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, communications from the mayor please.

391
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:02,051
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Fevella, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

392
00:29:09,471 --> 00:29:13,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that's right.

393
00:29:13,513 --> 00:29:15,734
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1, 3-1-6.

394
00:29:16,094 --> 00:29:17,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Our mutual agreement.

395
00:29:18,035 --> 00:29:37,005
[SPEAKER_14]: Dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request or recommend that pursuant to Mass General Laws, Chapter 48, Section 59A, the city council, by affirmative vote of this communication, authorize the city of Medford Fire Department to go to aid another city, town,

396
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:54,019
[SPEAKER_14]: fire district area under federal jurisdiction in this commonwealth or any adjoining state and extinguishing fires therein or rendering any other emergency aid or performing any detail as ordered by the head of the fire department or the joint base Cape Cod fire district.

397
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:06,089
[SPEAKER_14]: And while in the performance of their duties in extending such aid, the members of our department shall have the same immunities, privileges that they were performing the same within this municipality.

398
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:20,287
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a resolution, this is a reauthorization of the Metro Fire Mutual Aid Agreement that was executed in November 2001 for a 20-year term, and will expire on October 31st, 2021.

399
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:26,831
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief of the Department, Frank Gilberti, will be present to answer any of the Councilor's questions.

400
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:29,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Sincerely, Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

401
00:30:30,614 --> 00:30:33,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief Gilberti.

402
00:30:33,436 --> 00:30:34,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, we had

403
00:30:35,888 --> 00:30:53,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Metro Fire, our organization of 35 fire chiefs in and around the Boston area, we had our attorney review the mutual aid agreement that was actually 20 years old and revised it somewhat.

404
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:02,625
[SPEAKER_12]: There was some redundancy, but as far as Chapter 48, Section 59A goes, many of the communities

405
00:31:06,022 --> 00:31:09,404
[SPEAKER_12]: 20 years ago, we don't know if they adopted 59A.

406
00:31:12,786 --> 00:31:34,077
[SPEAKER_12]: So in order to put everybody on the same page and reaffirm and confirm, they ask that all cities and towns, whether it's through their local board of aldermen or council, that they authorize this through a vote of their body.

407
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:45,535
[SPEAKER_12]: So that every, again, like I said, so everybody's on the same page and it's a reauthorization of the mutual aid agreement.

408
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:47,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Chief.

409
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

410
00:31:50,037 --> 00:31:52,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I think I brought this up earlier.

411
00:31:52,138 --> 00:31:57,079
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is a huge tool that we need to be part of.

412
00:31:57,619 --> 00:32:05,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, two fires in Somerville, the Chief just mentioned right now in Everett, that we can help each other

413
00:32:05,912 --> 00:32:10,913
[SPEAKER_14]: when it comes to something as devastating as fire and safety and wellness for our communities.

414
00:32:11,573 --> 00:32:13,494
[SPEAKER_14]: And it goes both ways.

415
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:30,597
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that when we've had some serious fires here in Medford, we would often see neighbor communities here supporting our firefighters or at least covering our stations while our firefighters were out on the call.

416
00:32:32,466 --> 00:32:49,799
[SPEAKER_14]: I move approval and like again, like I said to the Chief Gilberti, we appreciate everything our men and women do in our fire department and making sure everybody is safe and not only for our community, but our neighboring community.

417
00:32:49,819 --> 00:32:50,280
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

418
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:51,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Second the motion.

419
00:32:52,441 --> 00:32:55,644
[SPEAKER_14]: All in the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

420
00:32:56,545 --> 00:32:57,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Mux.

421
00:32:59,127 --> 00:33:00,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

422
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:02,049
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to thank Chief Gilberti,

423
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:13,453
[SPEAKER_14]: I do have just one comment, Mr. President, that, you know, who really needs the mutual aid is our current firefighters who are going through a very difficult negotiation, Mr. President.

424
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:16,694
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's where the mutual aid is needed right now in our community.

425
00:33:16,714 --> 00:33:17,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

426
00:33:17,974 --> 00:33:18,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Council Member.

427
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:23,155
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Scott Perry, seconded by Councilor Falco.

428
00:33:24,016 --> 00:33:25,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

429
00:33:26,836 --> 00:33:27,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears.

430
00:33:28,076 --> 00:33:28,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

431
00:33:29,937 --> 00:33:30,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

432
00:33:31,852 --> 00:33:32,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

433
00:33:32,792 --> 00:33:33,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

434
00:33:33,653 --> 00:33:34,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

435
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:34,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

436
00:33:35,653 --> 00:33:36,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

437
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:36,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

438
00:33:38,114 --> 00:33:38,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

439
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:39,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

440
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:40,274
[SPEAKER_14]: President Ferraro.

441
00:33:40,334 --> 00:33:41,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Senator Deferment.

442
00:33:41,695 --> 00:33:42,615

[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to revert back to regular business, Mr. President.

[SPEAKER_14]: All the motion by- Second.

445
00:33:47,616 --> 00:33:53,438
[SPEAKER_14]: By Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Bears, I think it was.

446
00:33:53,838 --> 00:33:54,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Regular business.

447
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

448
00:33:57,459 --> 00:33:57,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Chief.

449
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you all.

450
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,040
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate your time.

451
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

452
00:34:02,563 --> 00:34:05,485
[SPEAKER_14]: This is to revert back to regular business council bears.

453
00:34:07,726 --> 00:34:07,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

454
00:34:09,387 --> 00:34:09,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

455
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:11,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

456
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:14,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

457
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

458
00:34:17,811 --> 00:34:18,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

459
00:34:19,012 --> 00:34:19,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

460
00:34:19,272 --> 00:34:19,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

461
00:34:19,512 --> 00:34:31,438
[SPEAKER_14]: 7 affirmative motion passes to 1308 offered by President care reveal will be a result of the city council have a city engineer, representative members source, attend the next council meeting to explain the new

462
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:35,247
[SPEAKER_14]: cutouts, Winter Street and areas that have already been dug up.

463
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:43,150
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason I put this on, I don't know if any of you have driven down Winter Street all the way down to the end.

464
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:47,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Areas of Winter Street that have already been dug up are now being marked out again.

465
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,933
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like they're going to be dug up again.

466
00:34:52,861 --> 00:34:58,585
[SPEAKER_14]: How many summers are we gonna have the residents of these neighborhoods go through another summer of construction?

467
00:34:58,845 --> 00:35:02,347
[SPEAKER_14]: If they just got through digging and filling, why are we digging again?

468
00:35:02,787 --> 00:35:09,032
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll leave this up to my other counselors for comments and we'll go from there.

469
00:35:09,372 --> 00:35:10,212
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scapelli.

470
00:35:10,232 --> 00:35:10,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

471
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:15,776
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe I put a resolution forward a few weeks ago asking for the administration

472
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:37,053
[SPEAKER_14]: work with Eversource to contact the neighbors in the Winthrop Street area so we can hold a meeting, again, outdoors like we did on Fulton Street, so it would be, you know, anybody that's felt uncomfortable with the COVID pandemic still, that we can speak openly in an area where we can get the information needed.

473
00:35:37,153 --> 00:35:44,959
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we also asked for, I believe it was Councilor Falco that asked to post information for Eversource.

474
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:46,160
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that was one of the,

475
00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:53,475
[SPEAKER_14]: one of my fellow counselors that so the information could be online for our residents just to go to start the timeline.

476
00:35:53,535 --> 00:36:13,860
[SPEAKER_14]: So if again, I could reaffirm this amendment that we asked to have this meeting as soon as possible so they can answer these questions as well as set up a timeline so we can keep all of our residents informed of what's going to happen in relatively a short period of time with

477
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:18,151
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, some major construction again on one of our major roadways.

478
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:19,292
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

479
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:21,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

480
00:36:21,574 --> 00:36:22,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

481
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:24,256
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank you for bringing this forward.

482
00:36:24,276 --> 00:36:26,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually out on a walk this weekend and I did notice.

483
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:33,417
[SPEAKER_03]: that it looks like actually it's already pre-cut and it looks kind of almost like an S going all the way down Winthrop Street.

484
00:36:33,517 --> 00:36:43,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question I had and actually Councilor Scott, probably you just hit it in the last part of your comments was basically let's find out what's going on, but let's get the timetable.

485
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:52,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make sure that we have a timetable that the residents have a timetable as to when the work is going to happen, how long it's going to take and when this job is finally going to be done.

486
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:53,612
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

487
00:36:53,892 --> 00:36:54,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

488
00:36:56,886 --> 00:36:57,486
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

489
00:36:57,826 --> 00:36:59,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

490
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:07,689
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe when Eversource first came before us, some years ago now, it was Councilor Marksley called me at the time, I believe.

491
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,091
[SPEAKER_14]: And we discussed a number of issues surrounding this project.

492
00:37:11,691 --> 00:37:22,414
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the things I brought up was a requirement when we issued the permit for granted location that there was no storage of any equipment, materials, or debris.

493
00:37:23,214 --> 00:37:23,654
[SPEAKER_14]: on the sites.

494
00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:52,335
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you drive down that stretch of Winthrop Street, say from, oh, the gateway of Medford, from the Winchester line into Medford, past Temple Shalom, to the end of Victory Park, if you drive past the entrance of historic Oak Grove Cemetery, which we just invested, what, about a million bucks of community preservation money into, you'll find about 25 to 30 steel plates stacked up, rusted out, that have been sitting there all winter long, Mr. President, that they use to cover the holes that they make on the street.

495
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:58,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, in violation of the requirements and policy that we asked them to keep debris free from the street.

496
00:37:58,918 --> 00:38:08,886
[SPEAKER_14]: And also if you drive a little bit further past Victory Park on the left hand side, Mr. President, you'll see an inordinate amount of kerbstone, granite kerbstones that have just been piled up there for months on end.

497
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:13,310
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't what I would expect from a public contractor doing utility work here in our community.

498
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:18,634
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd expect our engineering office to be a little bit more strict when it comes to this type of thing.

499
00:38:18,674 --> 00:38:21,777
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd ask again, that we reiterate that question for the administration and stuff.

500
00:38:22,627 --> 00:38:29,473
[SPEAKER_14]: what's going on with the storage of equipment and debris and material there, and whether or not they're going to be complying with the special conditions of the grant location.

501
00:38:30,674 --> 00:38:32,735
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're making that a form of an amendment?

502
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,457
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd just like to ask for an update, Mr. President.

503
00:38:34,497 --> 00:38:36,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, amended for an update.

504
00:38:36,218 --> 00:38:37,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

505
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,441
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

506
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:40,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you again.

507
00:38:40,442 --> 00:38:42,363
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight brings up a good point.

508
00:38:42,964 --> 00:38:44,465
[SPEAKER_14]: As we're proceeding with

509
00:38:45,253 --> 00:38:54,399
[SPEAKER_14]: some major renovations to our roads and projects that again, to reiterate the Eversource, we have zero, zero benefit from.

510
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:05,385
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the city, we asked the city administration to make this paper, the city administration, that we truly have a clerk of the works presented.

511
00:39:05,405 --> 00:39:09,808
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we haven't, I know that it's always been either the engineer or DPW director.

512
00:39:10,188 --> 00:39:14,411
[SPEAKER_14]: I truly think we need people that are going to be checking in on the daily

513
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:22,333
[SPEAKER_14]: activity with the sites, making sure they're following through what we've asked them to do, because that's one of our, like I said, one of our major roadways.

514
00:39:22,413 --> 00:39:39,282
[SPEAKER_14]: And we also talked about the safety and concerns of our senior citizens that live on that roadway that have to come in and out of driveways, and that's the only way to park, and not having the ability for safe travel, or safe exit or entrance to their home.

515
00:39:39,342 --> 00:39:43,825
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that we need to invest to look into

516
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:50,934
[SPEAKER_14]: putting clerks of works into these huge projects.

517
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:53,416
[SPEAKER_14]: And it doesn't have to be on the city's dime.

518
00:39:53,456 --> 00:40:01,122
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is something that our engineer, our city administration reach out to Eversource to fund that position.

519
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:10,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, Method isn't benefiting from this at all, but I think we definitely need a watchdog there as long as this process lasts, as long as it does.

520
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:26,124
[SPEAKER_14]: reiterate Councilor Knight said, these aren't small issues, these are big issues when you're leaving these plates and curb cuts on the side of the road because you see families and how they traverse down those roadways in a safe manner.

521
00:40:26,164 --> 00:40:30,085
[SPEAKER_14]: So I ask that to be added to as an amendment.

522
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:32,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so you said.

523
00:40:35,847 --> 00:40:38,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you amended by Councilor Scarpelli.

524
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:48,463
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to my colleagues for their comments and suggestions along the lines of what Councilor Falco was saying.

525
00:40:49,584 --> 00:41:04,052
[SPEAKER_11]: In addition to a timeline for the specific work going on on Winthrop Street, I'd also like the update to from Eversource to give us any sort of impact on whether the reopening on Winthrop Street will lengthen the project.

526
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:10,196
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been told, at least from previous updates, that we should be nearing the end of this project, which is

527
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:12,399
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, impact to the community for years.

528
00:41:12,959 --> 00:41:20,566
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're reopening Winthrop Street, my concern is that we might see a whole nother winter without this project coming to a resolution.

529
00:41:20,986 --> 00:41:24,890
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to know what the long term impact if they're reopening Winthrop Street is.

530
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

531
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:27,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

532
00:41:27,753 --> 00:41:33,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so on the motion.

533
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:37,954
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could make the motion for me because I'm the president.

534
00:41:40,274 --> 00:41:48,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Next week, when the city engineer can have a representative from every source and table this next week or next week.

535
00:41:48,738 --> 00:41:49,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, most of the table.

536
00:41:49,938 --> 00:41:52,379
[SPEAKER_14]: So we report out the questions.

537
00:41:55,221 --> 00:42:02,324
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion that we have a question we report the question with amendments from Council members.

538
00:42:03,852 --> 00:42:05,132
[SPEAKER_14]: and Councilor Scarpelli.

539
00:42:07,213 --> 00:42:08,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I miss anybody?

540
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:08,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Second, no.

541
00:42:09,753 --> 00:42:11,454
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion by Councilor Scarpelli.

542
00:42:13,194 --> 00:42:16,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, yes.

543
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:28,698
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion to do the table, the resolution, but report out the questions by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

544
00:42:29,218 --> 00:42:30,338
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

562
00:43:03,112 --> 00:43:10,514

563
00:43:10,574 --> 00:43:22,058
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've known her my whole life, and I say, good woman, nice family, and just wanted to send our condolences to her family on her recent passing.

564
00:43:25,419 --> 00:43:32,621

566
00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:39,789

00:44:30,427 --> 00:44:33,388
[SPEAKER_14]: 21310 offered by Councilor Marks and Councilor Scarpelli.

580
00:44:33,408 --> 00:44:38,490
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the city's 5G small cell interim policy be discussed.

581
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:39,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

582
00:44:41,151 --> 00:44:42,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

583
00:44:42,331 --> 00:44:50,394
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to thank the number of residents that came out to attend this public meeting here tonight of the Medford City Council.

584
00:44:51,374 --> 00:44:58,537
[SPEAKER_14]: After attending the March 31st ad hoc small cell committee public hearing, I am concerned that corporate grade

585
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:08,604
[SPEAKER_14]: and commercial benefits of 5G will outweigh the potential long-term health effects of 5G on our residents, home values, and environment.

586
00:45:09,604 --> 00:45:16,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Method must delay any wireless build-out until the law and public policy catch up to the science.

587
00:45:18,171 --> 00:45:23,716
[SPEAKER_14]: The Federal Communication Commission's declaratory ruling effectively tied the hands

588
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:29,119
[SPEAKER_14]: of local municipalities to make decisions best for their community.

589
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:38,267
[SPEAKER_14]: The city is prohibited from taking any action that is seen as prohibiting Verizon's 5G rollout.

590
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:45,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Verizon representatives at one point during the hearing told Method residents unequivocally

591
00:45:46,311 --> 00:45:55,836
[SPEAKER_14]: that the FCC regulations would not allow for health concerns to be discussed as a reason for not approving their applications.

592
00:45:56,916 --> 00:46:08,442
[SPEAKER_14]: This comment, true or not, is outrageous and requires a formal complaint be filed with the FCC and our congressional representatives on behalf of our community.

593
00:46:09,863 --> 00:46:16,106
[SPEAKER_14]: The city, in my opinion, was ill prepared for the much anticipated 5G hearing.

594
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:32,648
[SPEAKER_14]: not presenting one subject matter expert to represent our city's interest and its residents, and only relied on the one-sided Verizon paid expert witnesses in which there were many.

595
00:46:34,149 --> 00:46:46,456
[SPEAKER_14]: The city has not requested any potential mitigation from Verizon to address further disenfranchisement of the communities in Method who can least afford Verizon's

596
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:47,850
[SPEAKER_14]: new 5G.

597
00:46:48,891 --> 00:47:00,361
[SPEAKER_14]: At the very least, Method should request Verizon provide free Wi-Fi to our communities of need, as well as schools, senior housing, and low-income housing.

598
00:47:02,422 --> 00:47:08,908
[SPEAKER_14]: 5G will substantially increase resonant exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic fields.

599
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:13,472
[SPEAKER_14]: This has been proven to be harmful to humans and the environment.

600
00:47:14,278 --> 00:47:15,659
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to engage the U.S.

601
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:23,522
[SPEAKER_14]: government to require the FCC to do an independent study of radio frequency standards and health risks.

602
00:47:24,343 --> 00:47:36,489
[SPEAKER_14]: We should support the recommendations of the 400 scientists and medical doctors who signed the 5G appeal that calls for an immediate moratorium on the deployment of 5G

603
00:47:37,768 --> 00:47:49,211
[SPEAKER_14]: and demand our government officials fund the research needed to adopt biologically based exposure limits that protect the health and safety of our residents and environment.

604
00:47:50,291 --> 00:48:01,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Human exposure guidelines for radio frequency used by the FCC are more than 20 years old and address only thermal, not biological impact of exposure.

605
00:48:02,895 --> 00:48:03,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Over the past 20 years,

606
00:48:04,818 --> 00:48:24,628
[SPEAKER_14]: A robust body of independent science has emerged showing significant biological impacts from exposure to radiofrequency microwave radiation, including clear evidence of cancer, neurological and cognitive harm, heart abnormalities, and reproductive effects.

607
00:48:25,808 --> 00:48:29,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Populations especially at risk include pregnant women,

608
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:38,034
[SPEAKER_14]: Children, the elderly, individuals with implanted medical devices, or cardiac or neurological problems.

609
00:48:39,755 --> 00:48:51,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, at that particular hearing, I asked a number of questions of the committee, as well as many residents, of which many remain unanswered at this particular time.

610
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:58,503
[SPEAKER_14]: I am going to offer a number of questions that were asked at that meeting with the hopes

611
00:48:59,246 --> 00:49:13,090
[SPEAKER_14]: that we will be able to get answers prior to the Thursday meeting that the Small Ad Hoc Subcommittee will have to go over the remaining 43 applications that's before us.

612
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:22,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Question number one, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli

613
00:49:22,725 --> 00:49:24,426
[SPEAKER_14]: for co-sponsoring this with me.

614
00:49:24,486 --> 00:49:27,809
[SPEAKER_14]: He's been there every step of the way and I appreciate his support in this.

615
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:29,750
[SPEAKER_14]: I know he has a lot to add as well.

616
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:49,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Question number one, the city's interim policy under the application process states, for residential areas, guidelines on structure height, lengths and minimum setback rules from dwellings, parks or playgrounds or similar recreational areas.

617
00:49:50,103 --> 00:49:53,405
[SPEAKER_14]: I asked that question last Thursday, Mr. President.

618
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:58,629
[SPEAKER_14]: What are the setback guidelines that were created under this interim policy?

619
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:04,513
[SPEAKER_14]: And to date, there has not been one setback guideline in this community.

620
00:50:05,014 --> 00:50:06,915
[SPEAKER_14]: So we don't know what the minimum setback.

621
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:18,824
[SPEAKER_14]: We heard from residents, and I think there's a resident here tonight, the small cell that they're going to put on the pole in front of his house is about 10 feet from a bedroom window.

622
00:50:20,316 --> 00:50:29,402
[SPEAKER_14]: This admits, Mr. President, harmful, in my opinion, harmful exposure and radio frequency to residents of this community.

623
00:50:29,842 --> 00:50:31,223
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know what the impact is.

624
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:33,564
[SPEAKER_14]: There hasn't been enough studies.

625
00:50:34,425 --> 00:50:41,029
[SPEAKER_14]: There's enough reading out there, and I must add on both sides, but we don't know what the studies are.

626
00:50:41,429 --> 00:50:43,711
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are we going to move forward hastily

627
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:47,682
[SPEAKER_14]: without knowing what the impact is, the health impact.

628
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:52,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Whether the FCC allows it or not, we are here to represent our residents.

629
00:50:54,143 --> 00:50:57,424
[SPEAKER_14]: The FCC doesn't care about the residents of this community.

630
00:50:59,124 --> 00:51:00,964
[SPEAKER_14]: We are here, that's our responsibility.

631
00:51:01,584 --> 00:51:08,106
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'd be negligent not to bring these up, these questions, and ask for answers before approval, Mr. President.

632
00:51:08,606 --> 00:51:09,826
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's question number one.

633
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:29,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Question number two, under the city's interim policy, the applicant must provide a description as to why the desired location is superior to other similar locations from a community perspective, including proximity to residential dwellings, schools, parks, and playgrounds.

634
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:42,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Verizon submitted their location selection criteria for each of the 44 applications stating it is not directly adjacent to a park, school, or playground.

635
00:51:43,202 --> 00:51:45,304
[SPEAKER_14]: And I asked this question last Thursday.

636
00:51:46,345 --> 00:51:48,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Why did they omit dwelling?

637
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Why does their location criteria

638
00:51:54,389 --> 00:52:02,234
[SPEAKER_14]: not in line with the city's interim policy that states it should be dwellings, schools, and parks, their location selected.

639
00:52:03,255 --> 00:52:05,616
[SPEAKER_14]: They left out, Mr. President, dwellings.

640
00:52:05,936 --> 00:52:06,457
[SPEAKER_14]: You know why?

641
00:52:07,017 --> 00:52:15,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Because many of these are within yards of dwellings, bedrooms, front porches, play areas where kids are, and so forth.

642
00:52:16,483 --> 00:52:21,406
[SPEAKER_14]: My next question, Mr. President, and I hope these questions don't fall on deaf ears.

643
00:52:21,446 --> 00:52:23,087
[SPEAKER_14]: I know we have a meeting Thursday.

644
00:52:23,902 --> 00:52:36,209
[SPEAKER_14]: And we got a robo call and we were already told by some members of that committee that they don't want any further discussion at this next meeting, which is outrageous, Mr. President.

645
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:42,672
[SPEAKER_14]: Outrageous at a public meeting to say you're going to pick and choose what public input you're going to accept.

646
00:52:42,972 --> 00:52:46,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Outrageous, especially for a department head to make that comment.

647
00:52:47,506 --> 00:52:48,306
[SPEAKER_14]: My next question.

648
00:52:48,747 --> 00:52:54,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Under the current interim policy, the applicant is required to provide a certificate of liability insurance.

649
00:52:55,250 --> 00:53:02,553
[SPEAKER_14]: The policies submitted by Verizon currently are all expired for each of the 44 petitions.

650
00:53:03,754 --> 00:53:04,894
[SPEAKER_14]: I brought that up at the meeting.

651
00:53:05,675 --> 00:53:13,138
[SPEAKER_14]: The chair of the meeting thanked me for bringing that to his attention, and then proceeded to say they can make that a condition of approval.

652
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone else, Mr. President?

653
00:53:16,744 --> 00:53:30,291
[SPEAKER_14]: If you wanted to file for a license in this building or an application to build, they would not let a submission of an incomplete application move forward, except for 5G.

654
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:32,913
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll make that a condition.

655
00:53:34,353 --> 00:53:37,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Unacceptable, Mr. President, in my opinion.

656
00:53:41,097 --> 00:53:42,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Amendments, Mr. President.

657
00:53:42,398 --> 00:53:45,139
[SPEAKER_14]: Those were, I'm sorry, I have a few more questions on the back.

658
00:53:46,894 --> 00:53:47,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Next question.

659
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:53,319
[SPEAKER_14]: How are the neighborhoods being chosen by Verizon for the 5G rollout?

660
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Wasn't my question at that meeting.

661
00:53:56,021 --> 00:54:03,547
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of residents asked Verizon representatives, why did you start off with the rollout with these particular neighborhoods?

662
00:54:04,848 --> 00:54:06,089
[SPEAKER_14]: We could not get an answer.

663
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:08,891
[SPEAKER_14]: We could not get a straight answer, Mr. President.

664
00:54:10,072 --> 00:54:14,056
[SPEAKER_14]: In my opinion, the neighborhoods that they picked out

665
00:54:14,946 --> 00:54:18,248
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to be the neighborhoods with least resistance.

666
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:22,311
[SPEAKER_14]: My personal opinion, which I'm entitled to.

667
00:54:23,351 --> 00:54:33,457
[SPEAKER_14]: I also believe, Mr. President, if you talk to anyone in this community, and they'll tell you when they drive through certain sections of this city, that they lose their phone call.

668
00:54:34,018 --> 00:54:35,419
[SPEAKER_14]: They lose their internet service.

669
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,502
[SPEAKER_14]: And by the way, it's not in the areas where they're rolling out.

670
00:54:41,762 --> 00:54:44,144
[SPEAKER_14]: It's in other areas that they're not rolling out.

671
00:54:44,977 --> 00:54:47,077
[SPEAKER_14]: that are the most complaint driven.

672
00:54:48,098 --> 00:55:05,782
[SPEAKER_14]: That says a lot about this process, because the minute they get 5G in this community, it's gonna be extremely difficult for the other 150 applications, which are coming, this is 44, there's gonna be another 150 and maybe two or 300 after that from other carriers.

673
00:55:07,362 --> 00:55:11,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Once they get their foot in the door, there's gonna be no stopping them.

674
00:55:12,096 --> 00:55:15,299
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what they're looking for Thursday to get their foot in the door.

675
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:21,264
[SPEAKER_14]: The next question, Mr. President.

676
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:27,029
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to know why they selected those particular neighborhoods for the rollout.

677
00:55:27,069 --> 00:55:30,432
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it was South Method, Method Square, and the Hillside.

678
00:55:32,469 --> 00:55:46,558
[SPEAKER_14]: The city's interim policy under aesthetics and requirements states each small cell wireless infrastructure antenna should be located entirely within a shroud or canister type enclosure.

679
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:59,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is the ad hoc small cell committee not following the city's interim policy and allowing Verizon not to locate these devices in a shroud or a canister?

680
00:56:00,450 --> 00:56:03,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are they allowing a condition of approval?

681
00:56:04,813 --> 00:56:07,676
[SPEAKER_14]: Why did they ask Verizon what their preference was?

682
00:56:08,576 --> 00:56:18,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are other cities like Cambridge stating that every single cell that they're putting up will be enclosed in a shroud or a canister?

683
00:56:19,004 --> 00:56:24,769
[SPEAKER_14]: But here in Medford, it's fine to ask Verizon, the petitioner, what's your preference?

684
00:56:25,689 --> 00:56:26,290
[SPEAKER_14]: And guess what?

685
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:29,192
[SPEAKER_14]: They prefer not to have it enclosed.

686
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:34,431
[SPEAKER_14]: My last question, Mr. President.

687
00:56:35,911 --> 00:56:39,253
[SPEAKER_14]: There's four members of the board, this small ad hoc committee.

688
00:56:39,933 --> 00:56:41,814
[SPEAKER_14]: They're all department heads here at City Hall.

689
00:56:42,194 --> 00:56:47,737
[SPEAKER_14]: And I must say, this is a very, very difficult decision for them to make.

690
00:56:48,677 --> 00:56:50,038
[SPEAKER_14]: It may sound like an easy decision.

691
00:56:50,298 --> 00:56:51,959
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not an easy decision.

692
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:53,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Our hand is tied.

693
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:01,863
[SPEAKER_14]: And we really should be looking at our federal delegation, our congressman, a woman, and our senator.

694
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:06,192
[SPEAKER_14]: or our senators to be asking for relief, Mr. President.

695
00:57:07,433 --> 00:57:15,256
[SPEAKER_14]: But why, out of the four representatives, when they took the first vote, which they approved, was the vote three to one?

696
00:57:15,616 --> 00:57:17,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Three in favor, one against.

697
00:57:18,237 --> 00:57:23,720
[SPEAKER_14]: The one against, Mr. President, in my opinion, did not state a reason why they were against.

698
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,662
[SPEAKER_14]: And that one person was the director of the Board of Health.

699
00:57:30,642 --> 00:57:31,743
[SPEAKER_14]: That should be concerning

700
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:46,353
[SPEAKER_14]: for every resident of this community, and I'd like to know what the reasoning is for the Board of Health Director to state that she was against these 5G small cells within our neighborhoods.

701
00:57:47,993 --> 00:57:50,654
[SPEAKER_14]: That's an important thing, and I'd like to know why, Mr. President.

702
00:57:53,294 --> 00:57:58,835
[SPEAKER_14]: I have eight amendments, if you could just bear with me, and I'd like to go through them.

703
00:57:59,256 --> 00:58:01,176
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the clerk does a great job capturing these,

704
00:58:01,758 --> 00:58:04,159
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel comfortable that this is all being captured.

705
00:58:04,999 --> 00:58:07,320
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to make a motion, Mr. President, my first amendment.

706
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:16,384
[SPEAKER_14]: The city's interim policy should be updated to include a cap on the number of 5G installations allowed in Medford.

707
00:58:18,064 --> 00:58:20,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently, there is no cap at all.

708
00:58:20,545 --> 00:58:22,866
[SPEAKER_14]: You can locate 10,000 of these in the city of Medford.

709
00:58:23,747 --> 00:58:25,527
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no cap, no restriction.

710
00:58:27,088 --> 00:58:29,929
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask that as my first motion, Mr. President.

711
00:58:31,089 --> 00:58:43,053
[SPEAKER_14]: The second motion, the city's interim policy should establish setback guidelines to address the distance small cell wireless facilities can be placed from residential housing.

712
00:58:44,633 --> 00:58:47,874
[SPEAKER_14]: So before we move forward, before we take any other vote,

713
00:58:49,062 --> 00:58:51,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Those guidelines, we've had plenty of time.

714
00:58:51,464 --> 00:59:00,992
[SPEAKER_14]: This policy has been in effect since 2019 from the previous administration and currently 15 to 16 months with this current administration.

715
00:59:01,713 --> 00:59:04,615
[SPEAKER_14]: The interim policy was created by Mayor Burke at the time.

716
00:59:05,036 --> 00:59:05,976
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a policy.

717
00:59:06,337 --> 00:59:09,559
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a city ordinance that would be created by the council.

718
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,501
[SPEAKER_14]: It's an interim city policy.

719
00:59:14,858 --> 00:59:20,924
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would be my second motion, Mr. President, the guidelines and distance from housing.

720
00:59:21,504 --> 00:59:26,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Third motion, amend city's interim policy to include the following language.

721
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:35,838
[SPEAKER_14]: In residential zoning districts, installations should not be placed directly in front of a residential home.

722
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:50,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Where there is a side yard setback with open space or other space, preference should be given to applications to locate an installation on the public way in front of a side yard setback.

723
00:59:51,509 --> 00:59:52,250
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't create that.

724
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:52,910
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish I did.

725
00:59:53,531 --> 00:59:55,492
[SPEAKER_14]: That's in the city of Cambridge's policy.

726
01:00:00,976 --> 01:00:04,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, if you don't get all this, I have it in writing so I can give it to you.

727
01:00:05,459 --> 01:00:06,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Fourth motion.

728
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:16,113
[SPEAKER_14]: The city amended its interim policy to create a location requirement which lists the most preferable locations.

729
01:00:17,454 --> 01:00:19,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Right now, we don't have such policy.

730
01:00:19,834 --> 01:00:25,976
[SPEAKER_14]: The following are the most preferred location areas for 5G installation in order of preference.

731
01:00:27,117 --> 01:00:36,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Industrial districts, number one, if not adjacent to a park, playground, school, residential district, or historic district.

732
01:00:37,981 --> 01:00:50,745
[SPEAKER_14]: The second most preferred location, public rights of way areas, if not adjacent to a park, playground, school, residential district, or historic district.

733
01:00:53,325 --> 01:00:58,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion number five, amend the city's interim policy to include the following language.

734
01:01:00,087 --> 01:01:06,009
[SPEAKER_14]: No application may seek approval for more than five proposed facilities.

735
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:17,913
[SPEAKER_14]: No applicant or closely held applicant may file more than two applications within a 60 day of one another.

736
01:01:19,113 --> 01:01:25,934
[SPEAKER_14]: So right now we have 44 applications that were filed, if not all the same day, within a day or two.

737
01:01:27,455 --> 01:01:33,796
[SPEAKER_14]: Other communities state no one application can have more than five and no applicant

738
01:01:35,253 --> 01:01:40,455
[SPEAKER_14]: may file more than two applications, so that would be 10 within a 60-day period.

739
01:01:41,576 --> 01:01:46,979
[SPEAKER_14]: How did we end up with 44 with another 150 to come, Mr. President?

740
01:01:47,339 --> 01:01:47,619
[SPEAKER_14]: Why?

741
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:53,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Because our interim policy, for better words, stinks.

742
01:01:53,562 --> 01:01:53,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

743
01:01:54,662 --> 01:01:55,182
[SPEAKER_14]: It stinks.

744
01:02:00,725 --> 01:02:01,646
[SPEAKER_14]: But it can be changed.

745
01:02:03,406 --> 01:02:04,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion number six.

746
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:20,302
[SPEAKER_14]: to request the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee not approve any more 5G applications until the city has ample time to review questions and policy comments submitted.

747
01:02:21,503 --> 01:02:33,692
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further requested, the city consult with its own 5G subject matter experts regarding issues of concern raised by residents regarding health and safety setbacks

748
01:02:34,745 --> 01:02:40,889
[SPEAKER_14]: FCC 5G regulations, potential mitigation, and other issues of concern.

749
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:44,411
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm asking for a vote tonight, Mr. President.

750
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:46,352
[SPEAKER_14]: We can separate these motions.

751
01:02:46,372 --> 01:02:49,474
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to do them all at once, but I have all night.

752
01:02:49,514 --> 01:02:50,474
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll take a vote on each.

753
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:56,458
[SPEAKER_14]: But this motion is asking that we send a message Thursday night to the ad hoc committee

754
01:02:57,955 --> 01:03:17,608
[SPEAKER_14]: No different than the message we sent, Mr. President, to the Zoning Board of Appeals back so many years ago when this council stood up and we thought that the Zoning Board of Appeals extended relief to a developer that hurt a neighborhood that we sued our own Zoning Board of Appeals.

755
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:23,472
[SPEAKER_14]: If Verizon doesn't like it, bring it on, Mr. President.

756
01:03:24,513 --> 01:03:24,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring it on.

757
01:03:25,373 --> 01:03:26,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Lawsuits don't scare me.

758
01:03:27,295 --> 01:03:27,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Bring it on.

759
01:03:28,646 --> 01:03:33,928
[SPEAKER_14]: What scares me is health concerns in our community and not being at the table and being able to have input.

760
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:53,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion number seven, request our federal delegation calls for an immediate moratorium on the deployment of 5G and fund the research needed to adopt biologically based exposure limits that protect the health and safety of our residents and the environment.

761
01:03:54,254 --> 01:03:55,754
[SPEAKER_14]: That is crucial, Mr. President.

762
01:03:58,629 --> 01:04:00,989
[SPEAKER_14]: That has to catch up with the science, Mr. President.

763
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:09,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently, the FCC is working off 20-year-old information, and there's much more information that has been updated over the last 20 years.

764
01:04:12,571 --> 01:04:27,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Currently, Mr. President, another amendment, the city's policy states, and I offer this as an amendment, only one small cell wireless facility shall be eligible to be approved on a poll and support structure in the

765
01:04:27,901 --> 01:04:31,203
[SPEAKER_14]: this is the town of Burlington, and this is what they state.

766
01:04:32,543 --> 01:04:39,507
[SPEAKER_14]: So the town of Burlington states only one wireless on each pole, for each provider.

767
01:04:39,527 --> 01:04:42,048
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

768
01:04:43,428 --> 01:04:44,929
[SPEAKER_14]: And that makes sense, Mr. President.

769
01:04:45,489 --> 01:04:51,112
[SPEAKER_14]: However, many communities require co-sharing, and they write it right into their policy.

770
01:04:51,672 --> 01:04:56,715
[SPEAKER_14]: So if Verizon wants to come in and you see the ads for AT&T now all over about 5G,

771
01:04:58,001 --> 01:04:58,581
[SPEAKER_14]: They're coming in.

772
01:04:59,382 --> 01:05:00,182
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no doubt about it.

773
01:05:00,222 --> 01:05:00,762
[SPEAKER_14]: They're coming in.

774
01:05:01,943 --> 01:05:07,486
[SPEAKER_14]: And to allow them to go on separate polls means they're going to be in front of every hall.

775
01:05:07,806 --> 01:05:09,887
[SPEAKER_14]: You can guarantee they'll be in front of every hall.

776
01:05:10,227 --> 01:05:16,431
[SPEAKER_14]: So at least if we can safeguard, if these are going to be installed, which I'm opposed to, that my motion would read,

777
01:05:17,156 --> 01:05:31,322
[SPEAKER_14]: It is the town's strong preference, on this case the city, that whenever an applicant poses to place a new small wireless facility, that the applicant co-locate the same on an existing wireless support structure.

778
01:05:33,203 --> 01:05:37,605
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would ask that that be adopted into our interim policy, Mr. President.

779
01:05:39,065 --> 01:05:40,446
[SPEAKER_14]: And the last thing I just want to give

780
01:05:40,956 --> 01:05:43,258
[SPEAKER_14]: is notification like I did last time.

781
01:05:43,678 --> 01:05:48,403
[SPEAKER_14]: There was over 160 residents that were on the Zoom call.

782
01:05:49,346 --> 01:05:52,368
[SPEAKER_14]: on March 31st.

783
01:05:52,388 --> 01:05:53,569
[SPEAKER_14]: 160, Mr. President.

784
01:05:53,969 --> 01:05:59,352
[SPEAKER_14]: You really, very seldom, I attend a lot of hearings, meetings, very seldom see the like of that.

785
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:09,038
[SPEAKER_14]: And let me tell you, if you had it on Zoom and opened it up to the public, that small ad hoc subcommittee should be meeting here at the chamber.

786
01:06:09,439 --> 01:06:11,800
[SPEAKER_14]: If this is not big enough, let's meet at Chevalier.

787
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:16,063
[SPEAKER_14]: If that's not big enough, let's meet at the Bosch at Karen Theater at the high school.

788
01:06:17,248 --> 01:06:19,629
[SPEAKER_14]: all handicap accessible, Mr. President.

789
01:06:21,209 --> 01:06:23,829
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't want to hear the excuse about COVID.

790
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:29,651
[SPEAKER_14]: We can accommodate and also accommodate the social distancing requirements.

791
01:06:30,831 --> 01:06:41,573
[SPEAKER_14]: So that alone, Mr. President, we had 160 on Zoom and we shut out many people that would love, that don't have access, that would love to come up like we have up here tonight and also participate.

792
01:06:41,913 --> 01:06:44,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Many seniors that have concerns, Mr. President.

793
01:06:45,151 --> 01:06:49,473
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I would respectfully ask the committee, they're under no obligation.

794
01:06:49,793 --> 01:06:50,893
[SPEAKER_14]: They can continue the meeting.

795
01:06:50,913 --> 01:06:53,314
[SPEAKER_14]: They already continued it once from the 31st.

796
01:06:53,614 --> 01:07:00,076
[SPEAKER_14]: They can continue it again to have an open public forum where people can attend in public as well as Zoom.

797
01:07:00,837 --> 01:07:04,458
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want people to start calling me up and saying, I'm trying to discourage Zoom.

798
01:07:04,478 --> 01:07:06,279
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not discouraging Zoom.

799
01:07:06,899 --> 01:07:12,601
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm saying add another avenue for people that may not access Zoom or may not want to use Zoom.

800
01:07:13,766 --> 01:07:16,528
[SPEAKER_14]: We can do it in a safe fashion, Mr. President.

801
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:26,735
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask anyone that's in shouting distance that this Thursday, April 8th at 6.30, the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee will meet once again.

802
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:36,521
[SPEAKER_14]: And the meeting is a continuation of the meeting originally begun on March 31st at 6 p.m.

803
01:07:37,902 --> 01:07:39,143
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a continuation

804
01:07:39,557 --> 01:07:47,567
[SPEAKER_14]: of the public hearing for Verizon applications for 43 proposed small cell infrastructures in the city of Medford.

805
01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:57,559
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would also state, Mr. President, that if anyone tells you on that committee they're only hearing certain testimony

806
01:07:58,687 --> 01:08:01,109
[SPEAKER_14]: only allowing certain public comments.

807
01:08:01,549 --> 01:08:06,753
[SPEAKER_14]: If you already spoke, unless this is directed directly in front of your house, they're not going to allow it.

808
01:08:07,613 --> 01:08:13,598
[SPEAKER_14]: They are in violation as far as I'm concerned, of the open meeting law and allowing for public input.

809
01:08:14,879 --> 01:08:15,879
[SPEAKER_14]: They're in violation.

810
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:21,643
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no way that states that you can only speak one time, Mr. President.

811
01:08:22,044 --> 01:08:28,108
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no way that states that you have to be directly impacted to speak in a public hearing.

812
01:08:32,401 --> 01:08:44,347
[SPEAKER_14]: The Zoom information, meeting ID, for those that want to go on Zoom, 933-7697-5064.

813
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:51,691
[SPEAKER_14]: And the passcode, they really don't want people to get on, because usually you go on a Zoom meeting.

814
01:08:52,151 --> 01:08:53,672
[SPEAKER_14]: This has a passcode on top of it.

815
01:08:53,692 --> 01:08:55,913
[SPEAKER_14]: 035-999.

816
01:08:55,933 --> 01:09:00,875
[SPEAKER_14]: And the dial-in number, which you can,

817
01:09:04,651 --> 01:09:05,211
[SPEAKER_14]: 929-205-6099.

818
01:09:05,231 --> 01:09:12,515
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I know there's a fair amount of residents here today that took the time.

819
01:09:12,535 --> 01:09:22,480
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Councilor Scarpelli, which co-sponsored this resolution, and we spent much time going through many of the recommendations here.

820
01:09:23,301 --> 01:09:25,202
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll let him speak for himself, Mr. President.

821
01:09:25,683 --> 01:09:34,706
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to thank my council colleagues for indulging me on this very important matter, Mr. President, of safety and awareness in this community.

822
01:09:37,187 --> 01:09:43,270
[SPEAKER_14]: On question number three, can you go over that again, the certificate of liability insurance?

823
01:09:50,893 --> 01:09:51,993
[SPEAKER_14]: So question number three,

824
01:09:54,269 --> 01:10:01,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Under the current interim policy, the applicant is required to provide a certificate of liability insurance.

825
01:10:02,075 --> 01:10:04,677
[SPEAKER_14]: The policies submitted by Verizon are expired.

826
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:09,440
[SPEAKER_14]: They were submitted when they originally filed the petitions back in 2019.

827
01:10:10,261 --> 01:10:19,028
[SPEAKER_14]: And the life on these was a year, and many of them were from just say June 2019 to, you know, the end of, yes,

828
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:23,465
[SPEAKER_14]: May of 2020.

829
01:10:23,705 --> 01:10:28,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Just so we can have them in the form of a question, you're requesting a new certificate of liability.

830
01:10:28,746 --> 01:10:30,607
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a requirement of the interim policy.

831
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:30,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

832
01:10:31,587 --> 01:10:34,608
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, and they weren't aware of it until I brought it up.

833
01:10:34,628 --> 01:10:48,230
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a very important, it may seem like a small thing, but insurance certificate of liability is a very important thing to safeguard our residents, our poles, safety walking underneath these poles, and so forth.

834
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:49,491
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate you bringing that up.

835
01:10:51,061 --> 01:10:57,022
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could pass all those questions on to the clerk, as neither one of us, we couldn't, we couldn't write that.

836
01:10:57,363 --> 01:10:58,943
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you could please pass those out.

837
01:10:59,223 --> 01:11:00,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do so.

838
01:11:00,363 --> 01:11:01,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

839
01:11:01,244 --> 01:11:02,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

840
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:03,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

841
01:11:03,084 --> 01:11:04,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

842
01:11:04,624 --> 01:11:04,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

843
01:11:04,964 --> 01:11:11,546
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I will not try to match what council Mox has said, because I said this the other night.

844
01:11:12,526 --> 01:11:14,067
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what a counselor does.

845
01:11:15,727 --> 01:11:18,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Council Mox was ahead of this before anybody else.

846
01:11:18,628 --> 01:11:19,508
[SPEAKER_14]: He did his homework.

847
01:11:19,946 --> 01:11:30,154
[SPEAKER_14]: He was thorough, and when he went to the meeting the other night, I was on that meeting, and I think it would have done a major disservice if I jumped in with what he's already done.

848
01:11:30,654 --> 01:11:36,759
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that we're lucky to have him spearhead this effort because there are concerns.

849
01:11:36,819 --> 01:11:46,246
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that Councilor Knight also has done his homework, and I wanna leave what he's done to be presented by his expertise.

850
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:48,567
[SPEAKER_14]: All I'm really focused on right now is

851
01:11:50,178 --> 01:11:56,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, the understanding that I support council marks and every syllable he mentioned this evening.

852
01:11:57,182 --> 01:12:00,323
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that there is such confusion out there right now.

853
01:12:00,743 --> 01:12:03,565
[SPEAKER_14]: That's coming from the administration.

854
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:04,265
[SPEAKER_14]: It's coming from

855
01:12:06,036 --> 01:12:15,363
[SPEAKER_14]: different department heads that who can do what, this is the city council's privy, this is the mayor's privy, so we'll clear that up, I believe, this evening.

856
01:12:15,743 --> 01:12:21,047
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do want to, if I can, there were department heads that were there the other night, Mr. President.

857
01:12:21,568 --> 01:12:26,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know, unfortunately I can't tell, is Tim McGibbon or Alicia Hunt on the call right now?

858
01:12:26,771 --> 01:12:28,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on a second.

859
01:12:33,576 --> 01:12:35,517
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not.

860
01:12:35,677 --> 01:12:36,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

861
01:12:36,138 --> 01:12:40,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that as Dave Rodriguez, the chief of staff, is he eligible to speak?

862
01:12:41,261 --> 01:12:42,421
[SPEAKER_14]: If I asked him a question.

863
01:12:46,744 --> 01:12:52,687
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not see him on the call.

864
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:53,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

865
01:12:54,628 --> 01:12:55,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you see him?

866
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,851
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see any of the people that you asked.

867
01:12:59,366 --> 01:13:18,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Council Marks already brought this up, but I wanted to make sure that we had someone on the call today that we can implore to them that the biggest call that one of the biggest bothersome issues that came about was something this council has worked hard to do, and that's making sure that everybody is represented, that everybody has a chance to speak.

868
01:13:19,485 --> 01:13:29,511
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we can go all the way back to the budget hearings last year that we had enough concerns that we didn't show up to a meeting because we wanted to make sure that there was a forum for everybody to speak.

869
01:13:30,092 --> 01:13:43,881
[SPEAKER_14]: We worked hard, the council president worked hard with the administration to make sure we have people here that I will bet you a dollar for everyone that they wouldn't have had an opportunity to get on Zoom to express their concerns to them.

870
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:49,124
[SPEAKER_14]: They're in a safe manner, they're socially distancing, they're following through all the rules,

871
01:13:49,654 --> 01:14:07,988
[SPEAKER_14]: And that brings me to the biggest question, the biggest issue I had with this, is that a department head mentioned that this, we've heard enough community participation and no one else can speak.

872
01:14:09,109 --> 01:14:14,634
[SPEAKER_14]: I wanna make sure that the chief of staff and the department heads understand they're running this meeting.

873
01:14:15,434 --> 01:14:17,596
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody that'll be there on Thursday,

874
01:14:18,781 --> 01:14:20,202
[SPEAKER_14]: I know listen, we've been there.

875
01:14:20,262 --> 01:14:23,624
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been the marathon meetings that will last at one two o'clock in the morning.

876
01:14:24,244 --> 01:14:25,124
[SPEAKER_14]: This is our job.

877
01:14:25,164 --> 01:14:26,125
[SPEAKER_14]: This is your job.

878
01:14:27,425 --> 01:14:39,812
[SPEAKER_14]: This is this affects everybody's just because it might not follow the telephone pole in front of your house doesn't mean that you can't listen to every concern of every citizen in our community because it matters.

879
01:14:40,592 --> 01:14:43,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Because today it's in front of one person's home.

880
01:14:44,254 --> 01:14:48,236
[SPEAKER_14]: But like we talked about, they're expecting another 4050 who knows how many more

881
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:51,309
[SPEAKER_14]: So this scares a lot of people.

882
01:14:51,609 --> 01:14:53,011
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a lot of questions out there.

883
01:14:53,231 --> 01:14:56,215
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll tell you, it just tells you how great the city of Medford is.

884
01:14:56,676 --> 01:15:01,862
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard some great dialogue from some brilliant people in our community.

885
01:15:02,896 --> 01:15:10,638
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, the only people that were answering those questions were scientists, or managers, or people involved with Verizon.

886
01:15:10,898 --> 01:15:19,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Either they work for the construction companies that'll be doing the installation, they weren't directly, one of the questions, do you work with Verizon?

887
01:15:19,721 --> 01:15:22,962
[SPEAKER_14]: And the answer was, no, I work for this company.

888
01:15:23,142 --> 01:15:26,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's the company that puts in the towers for Verizon.

889
01:15:26,983 --> 01:15:29,083
[SPEAKER_14]: So technically, he's telling the truth.

890
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,444
[SPEAKER_14]: But these are the issues that we have.

891
01:15:32,654 --> 01:15:38,936
[SPEAKER_14]: And why do we know that when communication can either help or hurt with the lack of?

892
01:15:39,896 --> 01:15:43,577
[SPEAKER_14]: A few years back, a gentleman named Bill Carr Jr.

893
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:46,918
[SPEAKER_14]: started a committee to build new fields behind Medford High School.

894
01:15:47,559 --> 01:15:55,221
[SPEAKER_14]: And what he did was he went out and secured a cell phone tower of over a million dollars to pay for those fields.

895
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:02,083
[SPEAKER_14]: And he was given every single hurdle to jump over, every single route to run through.

896
01:16:02,483 --> 01:16:15,649
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the biggest questions those neighbors had in the area, because everybody knows around the Medford High School area, there's absolutely zero cell space there, that no one can pick up a call.

897
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:20,171
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's one of the number one cell areas in the country, we were told.

898
01:16:21,292 --> 01:16:22,713
[SPEAKER_14]: And what we did is we brought in

899
01:16:23,755 --> 01:16:43,004
[SPEAKER_14]: Educators and scientists from MIT and Tufts that we didn't pay, they came in on their own, brought in by the community members because they worked at MIT or worked at Tufts, and they brought these professionals in that really helped all the neighbors understand what the scenarios were.

900
01:16:44,264 --> 01:16:47,546
[SPEAKER_14]: And that, to be honest with you, it calmed a lot of people down.

901
01:16:48,658 --> 01:17:01,224
[SPEAKER_14]: What we're seeing right now, what I'm hearing now with hundreds of emails and phone calls is the lack of representation of an independent person, an independent scientist that are gonna give us a little more insight.

902
01:17:02,565 --> 01:17:05,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Instead, we heard some great dialogue from people that have done their homework.

903
01:17:05,946 --> 01:17:09,508
[SPEAKER_14]: I know one gentleman, he had the study from Europe that they don't allow this at all.

904
01:17:09,528 --> 01:17:11,529
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not even a question.

905
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:17,912
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, the Board of Health was a member of that committee who voted no, that should speak volumes.

906
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:38,584
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, I implore the city administrators that will be running this meeting, whatever department it is, whether it's Alicia Hunt, whether it's Tim McGibbon, that they do not stop the process of our residents being able to speak, because this is their forum.

907
01:17:39,324 --> 01:17:40,605
[SPEAKER_14]: This is their community.

908
01:17:41,789 --> 01:17:51,173
[SPEAKER_14]: And I will tell you, if that does happen Thursday night, I will do everything in my power to make sure they are punished in every way possible through the state.

909
01:17:52,354 --> 01:17:59,477
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, Councilor Marks, I will not try to delve into what you've already said.

910
01:17:59,517 --> 01:18:06,860
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that it was stated perfectly, and I appreciate you standing strong, and I agree.

911
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:10,162
[SPEAKER_14]: We're gonna sue our own entity here in the city.

912
01:18:10,799 --> 01:18:13,521
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not afraid to stand up and make sure that our citizens are safe.

913
01:18:13,581 --> 01:18:14,382
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.

914
01:18:16,003 --> 01:18:16,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

915
01:18:16,303 --> 01:18:16,944
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

916
01:18:16,984 --> 01:18:17,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

917
01:18:17,904 --> 01:18:19,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

918
01:18:19,346 --> 01:18:23,989
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you for my two colleagues that preceded me on this topic.

919
01:18:24,189 --> 01:18:25,330
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to try to keep it short.

920
01:18:26,091 --> 01:18:38,420
[SPEAKER_14]: But ultimately, Mr. President, bottom line is people should have the right to know what health risks are associated with devices that are being affixed to poles outside the house by government entity.

921
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:39,781
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that just

922
01:18:40,411 --> 01:18:46,396
[SPEAKER_14]: It's ludicrous to me to think that the federal government would not recognize health risk as a basis for denial of an application.

923
01:18:47,537 --> 01:18:48,037
[SPEAKER_14]: It's shameful.

924
01:18:49,018 --> 01:18:55,223
[SPEAKER_14]: But Mr. President, I think the understatement of the year was made this evening when Consulate Max made his opening remarks.

925
01:18:56,684 --> 01:19:02,649
[SPEAKER_14]: The city of Medford was ill-prepared, ill-prepared for the 331 meeting.

926
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:05,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Going back to April of 2019,

927
01:19:07,674 --> 01:19:10,155
[SPEAKER_14]: That's when the first 5G site meeting was scheduled.

928
01:19:10,735 --> 01:19:14,877
[SPEAKER_14]: April, 2019, two years ago, and it was canceled.

929
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:25,041
[SPEAKER_14]: In August of 2019, then Mayor Burke came to us with this small cell ad hoc committee, and the council supported that.

930
01:19:25,061 --> 01:19:33,284
[SPEAKER_14]: In November, residents were notified of a site placement hearing, and that meeting was canceled.

931
01:19:35,965 --> 01:19:36,666
[SPEAKER_14]: In January of 2020,

932
01:19:38,271 --> 01:19:42,254
[SPEAKER_14]: An info session was held with Verizon and the members of this community here in this room.

933
01:19:42,294 --> 01:19:44,256
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a total and absolute failure.

934
01:19:44,876 --> 01:19:46,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Round tables, no question and answers.

935
01:19:47,438 --> 01:19:54,264
[SPEAKER_14]: It was more like a high school science fair than it was any type of symposium for residents to get questions or answers to their concern.

936
01:19:55,465 --> 01:20:03,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Which brings us to January of 2020 yet again, when this council passed a resolution unanimously with, I believe, a council that was sitting here.

937
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:04,792
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, she wasn't sitting here anymore.

938
01:20:04,812 --> 01:20:05,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Now she was across the hall.

939
01:20:07,574 --> 01:20:21,745
[SPEAKER_14]: We passed it unanimously asking the city call for a symposium where residents from this community could come and meet with the ad hoc small cell committee representatives from Verizon and the administration to talk about their concerns in the rollout of this project.

940
01:20:22,105 --> 01:20:22,785
[SPEAKER_14]: That never happened.

941
01:20:24,427 --> 01:20:36,996
[SPEAKER_14]: The very next week, Councilor Marks put forward a resolution because we haven't seen any movement that the small cell advisory committee implements stricter standards

942
01:20:37,634 --> 01:20:42,036
[SPEAKER_14]: on their application process to make it a little bit more difficult to walk into our community and do whatever they want.

943
01:20:44,036 --> 01:20:48,618
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is January 2020, February 2020, nothing.

944
01:20:50,259 --> 01:20:54,060
[SPEAKER_14]: March 2020, there was a 5G site meeting that was scheduled and canceled.

945
01:20:56,121 --> 01:21:06,965
[SPEAKER_14]: April, May, June, July, August, September, radio silence, nothing.

946
01:21:07,915 --> 01:21:09,435
[SPEAKER_14]: No movement, no activity, nothing.

947
01:21:10,996 --> 01:21:21,079
[SPEAKER_14]: November of 2020, the city administration calls for an executive session with this council to discuss a potential lawsuit from Verizon to the cities in action on the applications.

948
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:23,420
[SPEAKER_14]: November of 2020.

949
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,541
[SPEAKER_14]: December of 2020, nothing.

950
01:21:28,781 --> 01:21:31,442
[SPEAKER_14]: January of 2021, nothing.

951
01:21:32,623 --> 01:21:37,144
[SPEAKER_14]: February of 2021, a correspondence from the mayor's chief of staff indicating

952
01:21:37,742 --> 01:21:42,906
[SPEAKER_14]: that they're going to move forward with the site hearing for 5G with the Ad Hoc Small Cell Committee.

953
01:21:44,868 --> 01:21:45,829
[SPEAKER_14]: March of 2021.

954
01:21:48,591 --> 01:21:50,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Scheduled, canceled, and rescheduled.

955
01:21:51,333 --> 01:21:53,155
[SPEAKER_14]: March 31st, the meeting was held.

956
01:21:54,296 --> 01:22:03,423
[SPEAKER_14]: We are two years, two years from the initial date that these applications became an issue in this community.

957
01:22:03,724 --> 01:22:04,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Two for 24 months.

958
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:11,133
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are no further ahead today than we were on August 28th, 2019.

959
01:22:13,455 --> 01:22:14,215
[SPEAKER_14]: No further ahead.

960
01:22:15,636 --> 01:22:19,579
[SPEAKER_14]: I commend my colleague to doing his homework for raising the questions and bringing these issues forward, Mr. President.

961
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,721
[SPEAKER_14]: They're serious issues, serious issues.

962
01:22:22,702 --> 01:22:34,271
[SPEAKER_14]: And to think that one of us behind this rail is gonna take a vote not knowing if one of those devices can cause cancer to just one person in this community is insane, is insane to think that we're gonna take that risk.

963
01:22:34,975 --> 01:22:38,758
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to take that risk, and it's shameful for the federal government to put us in that position.

964
01:22:39,158 --> 01:22:40,919
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll stay with my colleagues all day on this one.

965
01:22:40,939 --> 01:22:44,041
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not taking a vote that's going to hurt people and put the health at risk if we don't know.

966
01:22:45,082 --> 01:22:47,143
[SPEAKER_14]: If we don't know, we shouldn't be taking the vote.

967
01:22:47,564 --> 01:22:50,365
[SPEAKER_14]: And I stand with my colleagues on this, and I thank you both for bringing this forward.

968
01:22:51,126 --> 01:22:51,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President.

969
01:22:51,786 --> 01:22:52,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

970
01:22:52,747 --> 01:22:53,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Cops Abyss.

971
01:22:54,528 --> 01:22:55,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

972
01:22:55,449 --> 01:22:56,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you to my colleagues.

973
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:03,094
[SPEAKER_11]: I won't reiterate the points and discussions that have already been made, but I do want to focus in on

974
01:23:03,596 --> 01:23:05,297
[SPEAKER_11]: specifics around the legality here.

975
01:23:06,438 --> 01:23:19,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I agree that it's shameful that corporations have managed to get the government to pass legislation and write regulations that gives them so much authority and takes authority away from local governments that are really responsible for these decisions at the end of the day.

976
01:23:21,107 --> 01:23:27,611
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do want to propose a B paper, and I'll get to the text of it in a second, that focuses on the legal matters here.

977
01:23:29,312 --> 01:23:29,833
[SPEAKER_11]: There were two

978
01:23:30,891 --> 01:23:33,153
[SPEAKER_11]: orders issued by the FCC in 2018.

979
01:23:33,213 --> 01:23:42,739
[SPEAKER_11]: An August 2018 moratoria order and a September 2018 small cell order that essentially is the reason that we're in this position.

980
01:23:42,979 --> 01:23:46,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Completely limits the ability of local governments to address the issue.

981
01:23:47,422 --> 01:23:48,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Those orders have been litigated.

982
01:23:48,783 --> 01:24:00,131
[SPEAKER_11]: Communities have challenged those orders and all the way up to the Ninth District Court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the litigation has been denied.

983
01:24:01,038 --> 01:24:06,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Courts have said that the FCC order is a blanket, that that is, you know, that that's the law.

984
01:24:06,862 --> 01:24:14,586
[SPEAKER_11]: So I agree that with what Councilor Knight said especially, this is not, you know, something that we should be voting on.

985
01:24:14,926 --> 01:24:29,135
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the end of the day, unless we have a change in federal law and unless state laws are changed, if there's litigation, it'll be moved up to the chain, you know, moving up the chain of courts and eventually Verizon will force its way through anyway.

986
01:24:29,765 --> 01:24:35,288
[SPEAKER_11]: and it will also cost the city money according to the FCC order.

987
01:24:35,348 --> 01:24:56,381
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to propose a B paper specifically focused on the legal question, which is that the city council request that the Biden administration, the FCC, and our federal delegation amend the FCC's August 2018 moratoria order and September 2018 small cell order to remove restrictions on local government authority to regulate the design

988
01:24:56,766 --> 01:25:00,289
[SPEAKER_11]: replacement and installation of five G small cell transmitters.

989
01:25:01,189 --> 01:25:03,311
[SPEAKER_11]: And that we receive a reply within 30 days.

990
01:25:03,711 --> 01:25:05,833
[SPEAKER_11]: And Mr. Clerk, I'm going to send that to you right now.

991
01:25:06,754 --> 01:25:08,395
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciate the comments of my colleagues.

992
01:25:08,435 --> 01:25:11,097
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to focus specifically on that legal question.

993
01:25:11,897 --> 01:25:16,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Because, you know, we may find ourselves right back in the same position after years of lawsuits.

994
01:25:19,123 --> 01:25:19,383
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

995
01:25:22,432 --> 01:25:23,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

996
01:25:23,213 --> 01:25:26,976
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Marks for bringing this forward tonight.

997
01:25:27,736 --> 01:25:33,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know Councilor Marks, you brought a number of resolutions regarding 5G before us.

998
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:41,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank you both for all your time, effort, and energy that you put into this, because I know you put in a large amount of time and effort.

999
01:25:41,828 --> 01:25:49,294
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the last resolution you put forward, there were at least nine amendments, which, you know, it was very detailed.

1000
01:25:49,874 --> 01:25:52,116
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank you for your time advocating

1001
01:25:53,068 --> 01:25:55,990
[SPEAKER_03]: for the residents and thank the residents for coming down as well.

1002
01:25:56,851 --> 01:26:06,457
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, technology is great, but if there are adverse health effects, you know, those need to be looked at and they need to be researched and there shouldn't be a rush to judgment.

1003
01:26:06,597 --> 01:26:11,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I myself have someone that I actually have a telephone pole right in front of my house.

1004
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,161
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably about 15, 20 feet from the house.

1005
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:16,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know I wouldn't want it in front of my house.

1006
01:26:17,515 --> 01:26:21,236
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, from everything I read, it's questionable.

1007
01:26:21,296 --> 01:26:22,676
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have the answers.

1008
01:26:22,916 --> 01:26:26,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And to vote on this, I mean, I don't feel comfortable on it.

1009
01:26:27,117 --> 01:26:32,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know I wouldn't want to put it in front of my house if I didn't have those answers.

1010
01:26:32,679 --> 01:26:34,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like it's very unclear.

1011
01:26:34,179 --> 01:26:35,239
[SPEAKER_03]: The research is unclear.

1012
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And it needs to be researched more.

1013
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:44,902
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, if there's any type of health effects, negative health effects, they need to be researched.

1014
01:26:47,403 --> 01:26:55,549
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I thank you for, you know, standing up and then fighting and I'm here with you and I support your motion, your amendment.

1015
01:26:55,589 --> 01:27:00,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thank you for continuing this and bringing it forward and I'm with you.

1016
01:27:00,712 --> 01:27:01,453
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1017
01:27:03,174 --> 01:27:03,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Rowe.

1018
01:27:04,915 --> 01:27:05,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1019
01:27:05,856 --> 01:27:09,758
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank my fellow councilors for their many salient points on this.

1020
01:27:09,838 --> 01:27:16,743
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely agree with Councilor Marks and Scarpelli that this was a real miscommunications opportunity from the city.

1021
01:27:17,496 --> 01:27:22,697
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's where we can kind of get runaway narratives in both direction when we are caught on our heels like this.

1022
01:27:23,478 --> 01:27:28,219
[SPEAKER_09]: And through my research and looking at other communities addressing this, because of course, we're not alone.

1023
01:27:29,179 --> 01:27:40,562
[SPEAKER_09]: The town of Belmont actually completed a full report, you know, assessing the technology and how to communicate it to residents and how to engage with residents around, you know, what a community could benefit from something like this.

1024
01:27:40,662 --> 01:27:42,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a benefit that is being offered?

1025
01:27:42,103 --> 01:27:43,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's a major

1026
01:27:43,609 --> 01:27:43,989
[SPEAKER_09]: the city of Medford.

1027
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:49,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a. Bone of contention and that it's essentially Verizon coming in for all of their benefit.

1028
01:27:49,711 --> 01:27:53,572
[SPEAKER_09]: No talk about how this could benefit the city of Medford or what impacts, um.

1029
01:27:54,392 --> 01:27:55,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Could be for the city of Medford.

1030
01:27:56,172 --> 01:27:58,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Um I also, um, being on the meeting.

1031
01:27:58,913 --> 01:28:00,854
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely took issue with the, um.

1032
01:28:01,714 --> 01:28:03,034
[SPEAKER_09]: The representative from Verizon.

1033
01:28:03,054 --> 01:28:05,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I uh, the scientist that was

1034
01:28:10,731 --> 01:28:11,571
[SPEAKER_09]: different times.

1035
01:28:11,651 --> 01:28:16,594
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that did anyone any favors by having that gentleman really talk down to residents.

1036
01:28:16,634 --> 01:28:18,594
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people have very valid questions.

1037
01:28:19,295 --> 01:28:26,278
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, as other councils have pointed out, we don't have the people we should have independent experts to help answer that.

1038
01:28:26,398 --> 01:28:30,519
[SPEAKER_09]: We are in no shortage of people studying this at our many great universities surrounding us.

1039
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:34,081
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it would be, again, as others have pointed out, very beneficial.

1040
01:28:34,879 --> 01:28:36,680
[SPEAKER_09]: to have those people to speak to it.

1041
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,681
[SPEAKER_09]: I very much support more research on this.

1042
01:28:40,101 --> 01:28:42,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, that's not what's before us right now.

1043
01:28:43,202 --> 01:29:02,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to add, I guess it would be a C paper at this point, in that it's my understanding that if we were to either adopt an ordinance or if the policy were to be updated, I don't know if that could be applied to the 44

1044
01:29:03,863 --> 01:29:05,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, that applications are already in.

1045
01:29:05,584 --> 01:29:16,413
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my understanding from the FCC, the way the legislation is written, that these aesthetic requirements or any conditions have to be set prior to receiving applications.

1046
01:29:16,573 --> 01:29:18,574
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would just seek clarity on that.

1047
01:29:18,614 --> 01:29:28,842
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if we were to adopt, um, additional conditions, if the city were to adopt additional conditions, could they actually be, uh, could they stand?

1048
01:29:28,902 --> 01:29:33,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Could they be legally applied, um, to existing applications?

1049
01:29:34,931 --> 01:29:37,333
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could email that to the clerk also.

1050
01:29:40,155 --> 01:29:52,445
[SPEAKER_14]: And I for one, I say, this is why we were elected to this body here, to protect the people of Medford and not be bullied by a big corporation like Verizon.

1051
01:29:52,705 --> 01:29:53,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Council Member Rollins is right.

1052
01:29:54,218 --> 01:30:02,543
[SPEAKER_14]: They were arrogant and rude and very condescending to the people that were there, and said, we're there to ask questions, and this is what we do, is we protect the people of Medford.

1053
01:30:02,783 --> 01:30:16,430
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank my fellow councillors, especially Councilor Marks, Councilor Scott, Councilor Knight, for the tremendous amount of work they did on this, and I thank them, and this is why I'm proud to be a member of this council, and I support all their motions.

1054
01:30:17,371 --> 01:30:19,732
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have some residents of the public that would like to speak on this.

1055
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:26,540
[SPEAKER_14]: And let me see, excuse me, name and address of the record, please.

1056
01:30:27,961 --> 01:30:29,261
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Anthony D'Antonio.

1057
01:30:30,162 --> 01:30:31,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I live at 24 Hicks Avenue.

1058
01:30:32,983 --> 01:30:39,665
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm glad to hear you counselors talking about the dangers involved with 5G.

1059
01:30:40,966 --> 01:30:47,909
[SPEAKER_14]: I was fortunate enough to work in the last 40 years that I've worked for the National Security Agency and U.S.

1060
01:30:47,949 --> 01:30:49,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Foreign Service members.

1061
01:30:50,650 --> 01:30:52,151
[SPEAKER_14]: And to give you an idea,

1062
01:30:53,504 --> 01:30:56,826
[SPEAKER_14]: how the technology has advanced to today.

1063
01:30:57,366 --> 01:31:06,671
[SPEAKER_14]: They used to use 18 inch concrete walls to keep the radiation, the microwaves and everything from going between office to office to office.

1064
01:31:07,272 --> 01:31:11,154
[SPEAKER_14]: When we were in the Cold War with Russia, Czechoslovakia was involved.

1065
01:31:11,274 --> 01:31:12,455
[SPEAKER_14]: All these people were involved.

1066
01:31:13,115 --> 01:31:14,256
[SPEAKER_14]: This is dangerous stuff.

1067
01:31:14,516 --> 01:31:15,717
[SPEAKER_14]: They will not admit it to you.

1068
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:21,720
[SPEAKER_14]: I could show you people who suffered horrible deaths because

1069
01:31:22,895 --> 01:31:27,876
[SPEAKER_14]: these rays that are coming everywhere you put one of these towers.

1070
01:31:28,676 --> 01:31:29,996
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a dangerous thing.

1071
01:31:31,416 --> 01:31:34,317
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't want to overstate it, but I'm going to give you a name.

1072
01:31:34,337 --> 01:31:42,438
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to say one word that I see coming in with this 5G networks, because it's only a money thing.

1073
01:31:43,139 --> 01:31:48,980
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's more control behind this 5G operation than any of you know right now.

1074
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,640
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to say one word, Chernobyl.

1075
01:31:52,375 --> 01:31:56,279
[SPEAKER_14]: Remember that when you talk with these people from Verizon.

1076
01:31:56,839 --> 01:31:57,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1077
01:31:58,220 --> 01:31:58,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1078
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:01,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Mary Ann Broxton.

1079
01:32:03,345 --> 01:32:06,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Mary Ann.

1080
01:32:08,329 --> 01:32:12,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Mary Ann, name and address for the record, please.

1081
01:32:14,955 --> 01:32:17,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Mary Ann Broxton, 25 Exchange Avenue, Medford.

1082
01:32:19,264 --> 01:32:27,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilmarks mentioned one thing, I'm sorry and I just want to have them clarify when he was talking about commercial districts, and it was in your list of amendments.

1083
01:32:28,392 --> 01:32:36,580
[SPEAKER_01]: I. Could you clarify what you were saying, whether you said that it is okay to put these boxes in commercial districts.

1084
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:41,404
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, um, I have a question about that because

1085
01:32:42,094 --> 01:32:47,740
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in what is considered a commercial district by the city of Medford housing development report.

1086
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:52,764
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're saying it's okay to be putting these boxes in, in a commercial district.

1087
01:32:53,365 --> 01:32:56,188
[SPEAKER_01]: There's residents that also live in commercial districts.

1088
01:32:56,848 --> 01:33:00,392
[SPEAKER_01]: So could you please clarify if that's what you said or if I just misheard you.

1089
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:03,041
[SPEAKER_14]: through the chair to Councilor Marks.

1090
01:33:03,721 --> 01:33:04,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1091
01:33:04,762 --> 01:33:19,753
[SPEAKER_14]: So my motion regarding the most preferable locations was the following, to locate them in industrial districts, if not adjacent to a park, playground, school, residential district, or historic district.

1092
01:33:20,287 --> 01:33:23,408
[SPEAKER_14]: So the most preferential would be an industrial district.

1093
01:33:23,928 --> 01:33:32,212
[SPEAKER_14]: The second one would be a public right of way in areas not adjacent to parks, playgrounds, schools, or residential districts.

1094
01:33:32,652 --> 01:33:40,715
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you live in a residential area that abuts an industrial district or public right of way, this would not be a preference.

1095
01:33:41,095 --> 01:33:47,838
[SPEAKER_14]: So in your case, Marianne, it would not be located near your parcel or housing.

1096
01:33:49,389 --> 01:33:50,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Miriam, does that answer your question?

1097
01:33:53,470 --> 01:34:01,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I just want to like, when you say, are you making, what is the distinction between a commercial district and an industrial district?

1098
01:34:01,912 --> 01:34:04,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know, because what is your distinction with that?

1099
01:34:06,273 --> 01:34:08,154
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's how the city zone.

1100
01:34:08,174 --> 01:34:16,336
[SPEAKER_14]: So the city zoned in single family, one districts, single family, two districts, which would be multiple, you know, two family, three family neighborhoods.

1101
01:34:16,724 --> 01:34:21,169
[SPEAKER_14]: Industrial districts are more of a high-level industrial use.

1102
01:34:21,769 --> 01:34:24,172
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have many in this community, to be honest with you.

1103
01:34:24,612 --> 01:34:28,256
[SPEAKER_14]: And most surrounding cities and towns put that as a preference.

1104
01:34:28,677 --> 01:34:34,483
[SPEAKER_14]: So they don't want the 5G located in residential areas, single-family one, single-family two.

1105
01:34:34,783 --> 01:34:36,285
[SPEAKER_14]: They want them in industrial areas.

1106
01:34:36,772 --> 01:34:40,394
[SPEAKER_14]: which I don't believe you live in an industrial area.

1107
01:34:40,655 --> 01:34:49,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I live in what's considered a commercial district according to the city of Medford housing development plot, which is right off of Mystic Ave.

1108
01:34:49,421 --> 01:34:51,882
[SPEAKER_01]: And they consider that to be a commercial district.

1109
01:34:52,443 --> 01:34:58,707
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I wanna know like, what is your definition between the difference between an industrial and a commercial?

1110
01:34:59,147 --> 01:35:04,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then if we're saying that it's okay to put it in, is it just like a technicality of wording

1111
01:35:05,382 --> 01:35:08,043
[SPEAKER_01]: or is it two names for the same thing?

1112
01:35:08,644 --> 01:35:13,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if that's the case, then there's a lot of homes that are right off of Mystic Ave.

1113
01:35:16,128 --> 01:35:21,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, and either way, it states that you can't put it next to a residential district.

1114
01:35:22,271 --> 01:35:30,275
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you're on Mystic Ave and they're saying you're in a commercial district, they couldn't put it there because it abuts a residential district, right?

1115
01:35:30,815 --> 01:35:32,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you for the clarification.

1116
01:35:32,196 --> 01:35:33,096
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I wanted to know.

1117
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, yes, thank you.

1118
01:35:35,031 --> 01:35:35,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Marianne.

1119
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:38,252
[SPEAKER_14]: David, just for the record, please.

1120
01:35:38,392 --> 01:35:41,013
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Menton, Mass.

1121
01:35:41,253 --> 01:35:42,513
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a member of the Saugus Party.

1122
01:35:43,034 --> 01:35:44,754
[SPEAKER_14]: I see a couple of things different here.

1123
01:35:44,814 --> 01:35:52,617
[SPEAKER_14]: First of all, I'd like to thank the new sheriff in town, Councilor Marks, and his deputy, Mr. Scarpelli, because they did the work that the city should have done.

1124
01:35:52,957 --> 01:35:56,818
[SPEAKER_14]: The city was totally ill-prepared, and they were rude, and I will agree with you from what I watched.

1125
01:35:57,198 --> 01:36:00,079
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't do the whole four hours, but what I watched and what I saw.

1126
01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:07,776
[SPEAKER_14]: But everybody seems to be forgetting this is a $5 billion enterprise by Verizon nationwide.

1127
01:36:07,796 --> 01:36:08,257
[SPEAKER_14]: $5 billion.

1128
01:36:08,817 --> 01:36:11,620
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not giving this away for nothing to their subscribers.

1129
01:36:12,401 --> 01:36:19,549
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you can remember some few years ago, a couple of years ago, they put 143 new poles in the city of Met that they were preparing for this.

1130
01:36:20,049 --> 01:36:23,193
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was no questions asked at that particular time as to why.

1131
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:34,486
[SPEAKER_14]: So if in fact they were doing it then some two years ago, and you come to a meeting where the city is not only ill prepared, but they're staged against professionals, well, that's all that they do.

1132
01:36:34,546 --> 01:36:38,048
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what they get paid for to support their clients.

1133
01:36:38,508 --> 01:36:41,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, certainly the taxpayers of this community are not gonna get a hit.

1134
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:51,234
[SPEAKER_14]: This council votes, this council votes on road and street construction via any contractor that comes in.

1135
01:36:52,332 --> 01:37:03,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Can someone please explain, you're taking the time to explain it, secure some votes and send it to a committee, why this council is not having the final vote.

1136
01:37:04,323 --> 01:37:12,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Can somebody please explain why the mayor of this community is gonna have that sole authority of a four member committee?

1137
01:37:12,591 --> 01:37:15,193
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not even odd, it's an even member committee.

1138
01:37:16,474 --> 01:37:18,196
[SPEAKER_14]: What is the city of Medford getting out of this?

1139
01:37:18,823 --> 01:37:20,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there some financial remuneration?

1140
01:37:21,324 --> 01:37:23,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there something coming back to the school department?

1141
01:37:24,406 --> 01:37:28,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there something coming back that's going to be a complete benefit to this community?

1142
01:37:29,509 --> 01:37:32,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Verizon isn't doing this out of the goodness of its heart.

1143
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:35,171
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's take those areas that they want to go into.

1144
01:37:35,191 --> 01:37:41,655
[SPEAKER_14]: They went into the lowest socioeconomic areas of the city of Method, where they'll get the least resistance.

1145
01:37:41,715 --> 01:37:47,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if they went into the higher areas of the Lawrence Estates or in West Method, the pushback would have been different.

1146
01:37:48,308 --> 01:37:54,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the people there probably have more time and they understand the project a little bit better with the negative effect that it could have.

1147
01:37:55,854 --> 01:37:59,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Progress is something that we should not be afraid of.

1148
01:38:00,699 --> 01:38:03,281
[SPEAKER_14]: But progress should not make you afraid.

1149
01:38:04,252 --> 01:38:08,355
[SPEAKER_14]: to be afraid, because that's the problem that you have here in front of you.

1150
01:38:08,815 --> 01:38:21,723
[SPEAKER_14]: If this city council is not discussing this, the way you are, nobody out there via Zoom would have the ability to even want to understand what's going on, because technically it's just so far advanced.

1151
01:38:22,524 --> 01:38:26,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, when G4 came in, 4G, nobody said nothing.

1152
01:38:26,246 --> 01:38:28,188
[SPEAKER_14]: I probably don't even know what's going on with 4G.

1153
01:38:29,552 --> 01:38:30,692
[SPEAKER_14]: 5G is just the next one up.

1154
01:38:30,932 --> 01:38:37,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe it's a little bit faster, as you indicated, Councilor Marks, maybe the microwaves and the biology that goes around it, we don't have the answer.

1155
01:38:38,014 --> 01:38:51,518
[SPEAKER_14]: And even if you do get all the answers, and even if you do send all your resolutions in support of not having 5G, because number one, the city doesn't even know, you folks don't even know if you're gonna get a benefit financial or otherwise from Verizon.

1156
01:38:52,258 --> 01:38:53,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Who is this four member committee?

1157
01:38:54,759 --> 01:38:57,920
[SPEAKER_14]: You're gonna let an even number four member committee make a determination.

1158
01:38:58,735 --> 01:39:02,839
[SPEAKER_14]: for the entire taxpayers of the city of Medford on Verizon 5G.

1159
01:39:03,319 --> 01:39:05,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Your rates are gonna go up whether you realize it or not.

1160
01:39:06,222 --> 01:39:08,263
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not gonna spend $5 billion for nothing.

1161
01:39:09,164 --> 01:39:11,727
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a big number, $5 billion.

1162
01:39:12,567 --> 01:39:17,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything that an enterprise does, they don't do it out of the goodness of their heart.

1163
01:39:17,732 --> 01:39:18,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, you may get quicker.

1164
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Listen, I'll show you.

1165
01:39:24,117 --> 01:39:24,638
[SPEAKER_14]: This is funny.

1166
01:39:25,154 --> 01:39:26,454
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm still on a flip phone.

1167
01:39:27,014 --> 01:39:32,856
[SPEAKER_14]: And this flip phone to me works just as well as any modern cell phone that you have out there.

1168
01:39:33,056 --> 01:39:34,136
[SPEAKER_14]: It does the same thing.

1169
01:39:34,796 --> 01:39:38,197
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not in my mind saying I have to have the most technological.

1170
01:39:38,657 --> 01:39:47,298
[SPEAKER_14]: There aren't many people like me that have this, but the ones that don't have it and the younger kids that today think that they have to have an Apple 8, 9, 10, whatever it might be.

1171
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:50,879
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the crazy part about this thing.

1172
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:55,000
[SPEAKER_14]: They're playing upon the emotions of the people and of the youngsters.

1173
01:39:55,333 --> 01:40:01,178
[SPEAKER_14]: But the unfortunate part is they're playing upon the medical part that nobody has an answer for yet.

1174
01:40:01,578 --> 01:40:09,464
[SPEAKER_14]: And until that answer is forthcoming, that subcommittee and this mayor should not make any determination whether they were accepted or rejected.

1175
01:40:09,885 --> 01:40:21,514
[SPEAKER_14]: And when the department head says that she, the office of community development department has said, they are not going to allow you to repeat yourself with a question, as Councilor Scarpelli alluded to, that is wrong.

1176
01:40:22,635 --> 01:40:23,896
[SPEAKER_14]: That is absolutely wrong.

1177
01:40:24,912 --> 01:40:26,573
[SPEAKER_14]: That's your first amendment right to speak.

1178
01:40:27,193 --> 01:40:30,515
[SPEAKER_14]: A taxpayer in this community, that's their right to speak.

1179
01:40:30,795 --> 01:40:34,257
[SPEAKER_14]: And if they don't like what they see or hear, they should not do it.

1180
01:40:35,017 --> 01:40:38,319
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know something, Council President, I would hope

1181
01:40:38,803 --> 01:40:50,070
[SPEAKER_14]: The thrust of this argument of having the ability to speak runs itself just as strong on the school department side on an issue that they've got over there, because they've not allowed the people to speak.

1182
01:40:50,290 --> 01:40:56,334
[SPEAKER_14]: They've not allowed the people to voice their opinion, and they've not allowed them to understand that there's two sides to a story.

1183
01:40:56,534 --> 01:41:00,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Until you have the tolerance to listen to both sides, nothing will ever get accomplished.

1184
01:41:01,117 --> 01:41:01,537
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1185
01:41:02,037 --> 01:41:04,339
[SPEAKER_14]: As former president Mayardo said, this is the people's world.

1186
01:41:06,380 --> 01:41:06,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1187
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:25,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any other residents who would like to speak?

1188
01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:26,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Barbara Kendall.

1189
01:41:27,331 --> 01:41:28,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 101 Sheridan Ave.

1190
01:41:28,612 --> 01:41:31,494
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could put your mask on please.

1191
01:41:32,534 --> 01:41:33,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, thank you.

1192
01:41:33,755 --> 01:41:33,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1193
01:41:34,781 --> 01:41:36,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, would you pass them along Tim?

1194
01:41:36,182 --> 01:41:36,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

1195
01:41:37,603 --> 01:41:47,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has been my family home since 1955 and a 5G small cell tower is scheduled to be installed on a telephone pole in front of my house.

1196
01:41:48,489 --> 01:41:51,190
[SPEAKER_04]: All the homes in Sheridan Avenue are affected by this installation.

1197
01:41:51,451 --> 01:41:53,112
[SPEAKER_04]: They all can be seen from their front doors.

1198
01:41:53,732 --> 01:42:00,696
[SPEAKER_04]: We are adamantly opposed to the placement of this tower in our residential area and we'll seek legal counsel if necessary to stop this particular installation.

1199
01:42:01,547 --> 01:42:05,971
[SPEAKER_04]: In the short term time since I received a copy of the application application 29.

1200
01:42:06,571 --> 01:42:14,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been able to collect 20 signatures of homeowners residents and taxpayers, sure enough, or opposed to this installation in the application.

1201
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:23,023
[SPEAKER_04]: or this thing that I'm showing you now, you'll see which shows the poll and the proposed additions to the poll itself.

1202
01:42:23,463 --> 01:42:25,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Five additional boxes excluding the antenna.

1203
01:42:25,984 --> 01:42:32,827
[SPEAKER_04]: The application states that three antennas will be installed, 2.5 feet high, almost a foot wide, and a half a foot in depth.

1204
01:42:33,027 --> 01:42:37,769
[SPEAKER_04]: The NEMA 3R cabinet is four feet high, two feet wide, and almost two feet in depth.

1205
01:42:38,489 --> 01:42:39,830
[SPEAKER_04]: That's in that packet as well.

1206
01:42:40,791 --> 01:42:46,682
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to this cabinet, there are additional boxes, a service disconnect and distribution box, as well as a service meter box.

1207
01:42:47,142 --> 01:42:49,487
[SPEAKER_04]: These are also, again, shown in that LE2 drawing.

1208
01:42:50,283 --> 01:43:14,925
[SPEAKER_04]: le three shows me a tenant orientation plan with a small diagram showing the street grassy area the pole sits the sidewalk and the beginning of my property which is five feet from my front walking grass this pole already supports a lot of equipment existing primary power existing secondary power existing ctv existing telco slash fiber existing terminal box and a street light.

1209
01:43:16,167 --> 01:43:26,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, in deciding on 101 Sheridan Ave, and that's in this packet as well, Verizon, which is a multimillion dollar for profit company, did not take into consideration the impact on the neighborhoods.

1210
01:43:27,024 --> 01:43:31,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Verizon staff only looked at the four poles on Sheridan Avenue from Hooker Street down to Central Ave.

1211
01:43:33,011 --> 01:43:37,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Verizon, as you'll see that in the Verizon application it tells why they should pick that spot.

1212
01:43:38,556 --> 01:43:42,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Verizon did not look at the rest of the polls on Sheridan Ave from Hooker Street to Salmon Street.

1213
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:50,768
[SPEAKER_04]: There are areas of commercial businesses on Salmon Street that are more suitable for this type of application and will not impact the peaceful enjoyment of private homes.

1214
01:43:51,647 --> 01:43:56,491
[SPEAKER_04]: As this installation will have to be monitored on a regular basis, this will be another disruption to the neighborhood.

1215
01:43:56,711 --> 01:43:59,313
[SPEAKER_04]: We are already plagued by airplane noise.

1216
01:44:00,014 --> 01:44:04,057
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we will have to contend with cooling fans with quote, low noise profile.

1217
01:44:04,502 --> 01:44:06,885
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know what that means, a constant hum or whine.

1218
01:44:07,445 --> 01:44:10,509
[SPEAKER_04]: My bedrooms are on the second floor and a direct line with this pole.

1219
01:44:10,789 --> 01:44:14,033
[SPEAKER_04]: This installation does not enhance the neighborhood and will be an eyesore.

1220
01:44:14,433 --> 01:44:21,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Verizon stated that their equipment cannot be enclosed in a container or shroud as previously promised in the interim policy.

1221
01:44:22,458 --> 01:44:28,922
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is, why are these towers being installed in residential neighborhoods, in front of people's homes, instead of commercial or industrial areas?

1222
01:44:29,482 --> 01:44:40,008
[SPEAKER_04]: All the designated applications have some commercial property on every corner, gas stations, corner stores, restaurants, banks, and all of Stevenson Square.

1223
01:44:40,088 --> 01:44:43,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Spring Street has commercial properties at the top of the street, i.e.

1224
01:44:43,170 --> 01:44:46,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Salem Street at Central Ave and a small square before Magoon Avenue.

1225
01:44:47,619 --> 01:44:57,622
[SPEAKER_04]: According to the interim policy that I read, for residential areas, Method will establish guidelines on minimum setback rules from dwellings, parks, playgrounds, or similar recreational areas.

1226
01:44:58,182 --> 01:45:00,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Method has yet to establish these guidelines for setbacks.

1227
01:45:00,963 --> 01:45:07,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Consequently, the setback on my house on Sheridan Ave is less than 25 feet from my bed, and this is totally unacceptable.

1228
01:45:07,925 --> 01:45:13,046
[SPEAKER_04]: According to Tim McGovern, 101 Sheridan Ave has a setback of 24 feet from the pole to my front door.

1229
01:45:13,815 --> 01:45:18,857
[SPEAKER_04]: and my bedroom, but the actual setback from the pole to the beginning of my front walk is five feet.

1230
01:45:20,358 --> 01:45:20,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1231
01:45:21,278 --> 01:45:22,679
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1232
01:45:22,919 --> 01:45:23,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Diane Sullivan.

1233
01:45:29,882 --> 01:45:30,522
[SPEAKER_14]: Diane Sullivan.

1234
01:45:32,223 --> 01:45:34,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you, President Caraviello.

1235
01:45:34,884 --> 01:45:38,506
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, yes, Jerome Street, West Medford.

1236
01:45:39,486 --> 01:45:40,947
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to note that

1237
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:47,284
[SPEAKER_00]: And really highlight seeing unity on an issue is actually really encouraging to me.

1238
01:45:47,845 --> 01:45:50,307
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the pushback that is being given.

1239
01:45:50,327 --> 01:45:58,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to note that, you know, we're all coming and rallying around potential threats to public health.

1240
01:45:58,993 --> 01:46:03,237
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to note those things that we know are threats to public health.

1241
01:46:03,317 --> 01:46:10,042
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to highlight a couple and just hope that we can see the same type of rallying and the same type of unity

1242
01:46:10,580 --> 01:46:14,002
[SPEAKER_00]: around issues like racism and hunger and homelessness.

1243
01:46:14,842 --> 01:46:17,884
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to note that and put that on the record.

1244
01:46:17,944 --> 01:46:19,925
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate everybody's energy around this.

1245
01:46:20,005 --> 01:46:20,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1246
01:46:20,645 --> 01:46:20,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1247
01:46:22,606 --> 01:46:23,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Andrew Castagnetti.

1248
01:46:25,368 --> 01:46:26,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Castagnetti.

1249
01:46:27,389 --> 01:46:27,869
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, sir.

1250
01:46:27,889 --> 01:46:30,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

1251
01:46:31,511 --> 01:46:34,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Castagnetti Andrew, Cushing Street, Method Mass.

1252
01:46:36,033 --> 01:46:39,055
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank all the councilors for bringing this up.

1253
01:46:40,578 --> 01:46:43,539
[SPEAKER_13]: and Mayor Marks and our citizens.

1254
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:48,881
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm also very concerned about this 5G.

1255
01:46:50,842 --> 01:47:06,989
[SPEAKER_13]: As a matter of fact, if it's so safe, as the Verizon people were telling us a few days ago, how about the mandatory, they put up a $10 billion bond for future possible health issues in 02155.

1256
01:47:07,089 --> 01:47:07,489
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way,

1257
01:47:11,101 --> 01:47:18,383
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a loved one who they plan to place one of these boxes in front of his bedroom window.

1258
01:47:20,344 --> 01:47:21,804
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm very, very concerned.

1259
01:47:22,384 --> 01:47:32,867
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's unfair and it's appalling that we as a community, according to GOP, have no push or say because the government okayed them.

1260
01:47:33,827 --> 01:47:38,829
[SPEAKER_13]: I presume Verizon and the other entities of that nature had their

1261
01:47:40,430 --> 01:47:45,034
[SPEAKER_13]: had their people, you know, basically bribe the politicians to give them cop lunch.

1262
01:47:45,494 --> 01:47:46,755
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very, very concerned.

1263
01:47:47,156 --> 01:47:48,297
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll see you Thursday night.

1264
01:47:50,078 --> 01:47:52,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1265
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:53,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Mary Ann Bronson, did you have another question?

1266
01:47:54,782 --> 01:47:55,623
[SPEAKER_14]: I see your hand up.

1267
01:47:57,965 --> 01:47:58,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, hi.

1268
01:47:59,286 --> 01:48:08,734
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say I appreciate Mr. Penter's comments, but I would like to say he said that people in low income areas don't understand these issues.

1269
01:48:09,706 --> 01:48:17,888
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk about an issue without insulting people that live in low-income areas or questioning people's intelligence based on their income status.

1270
01:48:18,788 --> 01:48:24,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would wish if some council members that were sitting there, when they heard that, also called it out.

1271
01:48:24,849 --> 01:48:29,991
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can all talk about issues without bringing up people's intelligence based on their income level.

1272
01:48:30,531 --> 01:48:30,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1273
01:48:31,871 --> 01:48:36,612
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that was the intent of Mr. Pinto to do that.

1274
01:48:37,205 --> 01:48:39,547
[SPEAKER_14]: And we apologize if we took it that way.

1275
01:48:40,007 --> 01:48:40,648
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize.

1276
01:48:41,308 --> 01:48:46,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I would like to, if the young lady felt insulted, I apologize.

1277
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:50,715
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's the marketing that Verizon does when they go out there.

1278
01:48:50,955 --> 01:48:57,419
[SPEAKER_14]: They go to the lowest socioeconomic areas because that's the ones that they feel that they can move into first.

1279
01:48:58,620 --> 01:48:59,481
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I said.

1280
01:48:59,721 --> 01:49:00,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1281
01:49:01,262 --> 01:49:04,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have anybody else from the public in the audience who would like to speak?

1282
01:49:09,267 --> 01:49:11,868
[SPEAKER_14]: only one instance, just one instance, just one.

1283
01:49:11,948 --> 01:49:15,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

1284
01:49:15,869 --> 01:49:17,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, my name is George.

1285
01:49:17,249 --> 01:49:18,910
[SPEAKER_14]: You can say six feet from him, he can stand up.

1286
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:20,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

1287
01:49:20,630 --> 01:49:25,311
[SPEAKER_14]: George Celestro, 1145 Bergen Road, born and raised in Medford.

1288
01:49:28,212 --> 01:49:37,135
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for standing up and stopping the votes on the night that they were doing that.

1289
01:49:39,062 --> 01:49:45,126
[SPEAKER_14]: The one that they did pass, the one and only that they did pass, and you stated that they're supposed to be away from Pox.

1290
01:49:46,447 --> 01:49:49,648
[SPEAKER_14]: College Ave, it's Stearns Ave, I believe it is.

1291
01:49:51,269 --> 01:49:52,830
[SPEAKER_14]: You got College Field right there.

1292
01:49:52,910 --> 01:49:53,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Tufts College is right there.

1293
01:49:54,992 --> 01:49:56,553
[SPEAKER_14]: There's schools across the street.

1294
01:49:58,234 --> 01:50:05,498
[SPEAKER_14]: And my house, they want to put a tower on the front of my pole.

1295
01:50:07,403 --> 01:50:20,551
[SPEAKER_14]: They did a great job of taking the picture from Court Street, because the pole is directly in front of my house, 10 feet from my property line, and the pole is only two feet from my property line.

1296
01:50:21,812 --> 01:50:23,093
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a total of 12 feet.

1297
01:50:23,973 --> 01:50:36,381
[SPEAKER_14]: My living room, my bedroom upstairs, it's just, and not to mention, I live 20 feet from a park, Brogan Park, Hickey Park.

1298
01:50:37,625 --> 01:50:41,306
[SPEAKER_14]: So it doesn't even meet the criteria that they're saying.

1299
01:50:41,567 --> 01:50:45,528
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason they put it there, because they said there was no room on Park Street.

1300
01:50:46,829 --> 01:50:55,172
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't wanna, you know, I mean, I have friends on Park Street, but somebody in the city or somebody cut five trees down on Park Street.

1301
01:50:55,632 --> 01:50:57,513
[SPEAKER_14]: That was one of the reasons they didn't put it on Park Street.

1302
01:50:59,754 --> 01:51:03,055
[SPEAKER_14]: I have four other properties that I got notices about it.

1303
01:51:03,535 --> 01:51:05,616
[SPEAKER_14]: I have tenants that are also,

1304
01:51:06,438 --> 01:51:09,500
[SPEAKER_14]: 10, 20 feet away from the house.

1305
01:51:11,341 --> 01:51:21,167
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not right that four people on a committee have the right or whoever put them there to make decisions for everybody in the city.

1306
01:51:23,529 --> 01:51:24,149
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not right.

1307
01:51:24,229 --> 01:51:30,373
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it was the worst meeting I've seen in my entire life that I've watched.

1308
01:51:30,413 --> 01:51:35,316
[SPEAKER_14]: And believe me, I don't watch many meetings, but this meeting was just

1309
01:51:37,014 --> 01:51:38,235
[SPEAKER_02]: brutal.

1310
01:51:38,275 --> 01:51:42,238
[SPEAKER_14]: They were clueless.

1311
01:51:42,418 --> 01:51:43,419
[SPEAKER_14]: They weren't prepared.

1312
01:51:43,839 --> 01:51:47,462
[SPEAKER_14]: They didn't have the right people on their team.

1313
01:51:48,083 --> 01:51:49,724
[SPEAKER_14]: They just, they weren't prepared.

1314
01:51:50,204 --> 01:51:52,566
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just, it wasn't right.

1315
01:51:52,626 --> 01:51:55,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was a sad night to stay up till 11 o'clock.

1316
01:51:56,589 --> 01:51:58,350
[SPEAKER_14]: And they kept saying, oh, we got to end this.

1317
01:51:58,711 --> 01:52:01,713
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank God, Councilor Marks got up and stopped it.

1318
01:52:02,794 --> 01:52:03,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Or they would have voted on all 44.

1319
01:52:03,654 --> 01:52:04,015
[SPEAKER_14]: I just

1320
01:52:07,836 --> 01:52:11,842
[SPEAKER_14]: I know the council will do the right thing for the residents of the city.

1321
01:52:12,704 --> 01:52:13,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1322
01:52:22,082 --> 01:52:26,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Dennis Detling, Calto for 120 North Street, Medford.

1323
01:52:29,027 --> 01:52:33,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what to add because I've already made comments in the past and I've sent emails.

1324
01:52:34,211 --> 01:52:43,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Just wanted to say that I'm very impressed with what Councilor Marks has put forward as far as the resolution.

1325
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:47,199
[SPEAKER_07]: And I hope that these measures pass.

1326
01:52:48,439 --> 01:52:54,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that it's always tough fighting the good fight against large corporations.

1327
01:52:55,282 --> 01:53:03,225
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been involved with this on and off all my life on issues of fighting racism, sexism, anti-gay bigotry.

1328
01:53:04,286 --> 01:53:09,107
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is not new to me, these kind of fights.

1329
01:53:09,167 --> 01:53:10,148
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that

1330
01:53:11,128 --> 01:53:19,491
[SPEAKER_07]: What people do and their voices speaking up does have an effect.

1331
01:53:20,691 --> 01:53:39,877
[SPEAKER_07]: And I noticed that, I don't know if it's a coincidence, but when I wrote to President Biden that he should fire the head of the US Postal Service, who is trying to destroy it, the next day,

1332
01:53:42,406 --> 01:53:45,688
[SPEAKER_07]: He appointed some members to that board.

1333
01:53:46,528 --> 01:53:55,774
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do think that public opinion does have an effect, and I think that the cities have an effect on what they say to the federal government.

1334
01:53:55,954 --> 01:54:00,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the Federal Communications Commission is out of touch.

1335
01:54:01,418 --> 01:54:10,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And whether or not this technology, which I believe is not safe, but whether it is safe or not, I believe that an independent study needs to be made.

1336
01:54:11,104 --> 01:54:19,228
[SPEAKER_07]: and that the city should have the right to regulate anything, any kind of utilities that go into place in their cities.

1337
01:54:19,468 --> 01:54:21,309
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we should really fight for that.

1338
01:54:21,989 --> 01:54:22,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1339
01:54:23,130 --> 01:54:23,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1340
01:54:24,391 --> 01:54:26,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have anybody else from the audience who would like to speak?

1341
01:54:30,754 --> 01:54:31,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1342
01:54:31,194 --> 01:54:32,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

1343
01:54:32,775 --> 01:54:33,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

1344
01:54:33,355 --> 01:54:37,637
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Marilyn Jordan, and my address is 101 Sheridan Avenue.

1345
01:54:37,837 --> 01:54:39,018
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my sister in the back.

1346
01:54:40,879 --> 01:54:43,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question, where do we go from here?

1347
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:50,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I know he put these, Councilor Marks put the amendments in, will you be voting on them this evening?

1348
01:54:52,683 --> 01:54:57,105
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we get an affirmative vote, where do we go from there?

1349
01:54:57,145 --> 01:55:00,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we take that Thursday night to the ad hoc committee?

1350
01:55:01,787 --> 01:55:04,007
[SPEAKER_14]: We will be sending these recommendations to the mayor.

1351
01:55:04,988 --> 01:55:05,428
[SPEAKER_14]: To the mayor.

1352
01:55:06,485 --> 01:55:17,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So would it behoove us, because we've gotten signatures, we're starting to organize in the Sheridan Grant area, would it behoove us to take those signatures up to the mayor's office?

1353
01:55:18,809 --> 01:55:21,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything you'd like to, that would be helpful.

1354
01:55:22,451 --> 01:55:34,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and so once we do this and we get up to the mayor's office, should we then go visit the, well, I don't know if they'll let us come en masse, if I can get enough of a group together,

1355
01:55:35,219 --> 01:55:38,441
[SPEAKER_05]: but should we go then to the ad hoc people?

1356
01:55:39,181 --> 01:55:43,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they in a committee by themselves or are they in different departments?

1357
01:55:43,524 --> 01:55:47,707
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to me you said they were all department heads.

1358
01:55:47,727 --> 01:55:52,029
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor would give them to the ad hoc committee.

1359
01:55:52,069 --> 01:55:52,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, if I could.

1360
01:55:55,111 --> 01:55:59,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President, you raised some excellent points because what is the next step?

1361
01:56:00,194 --> 01:56:03,316
[SPEAKER_14]: And this committee was created by an interim policy

1362
01:56:03,871 --> 01:56:05,712
[SPEAKER_14]: which was created by the previous mayor.

1363
01:56:06,213 --> 01:56:14,158
[SPEAKER_14]: So the previous mayor created this and selected these four department heads to be the ruling authority over this.

1364
01:56:14,558 --> 01:56:19,282
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why they have the authority to vote on these applications.

1365
01:56:19,702 --> 01:56:21,163
[SPEAKER_14]: They can also deny them as well.

1366
01:56:21,663 --> 01:56:26,487
[SPEAKER_14]: But my suggestion is they requested a continuation for March 31st.

1367
01:56:27,267 --> 01:56:31,450
[SPEAKER_14]: And their meeting is coming up on April 8th, which is this Thursday.

1368
01:56:32,256 --> 01:56:39,802
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what we have to do in order to realize you said you have a petition, we have a number of outstanding questions that have to be answered.

1369
01:56:40,182 --> 01:56:43,785
[SPEAKER_14]: People in this community have the right to unite and rally around an issue.

1370
01:56:44,366 --> 01:56:50,911
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we have to ask Thursday night for a continuation for them not to vote because ultimately that's what they're meeting for.

1371
01:56:51,191 --> 01:56:52,112
[SPEAKER_14]: They're meeting to vote.

1372
01:56:52,692 --> 01:56:57,556
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have to get on that meeting Thursday night and ask them for a continuation

1373
01:56:57,932 --> 01:57:04,677
[SPEAKER_14]: to allow for unanswered questions to be answered, allow us to get our petitions around, give us ample opportunities.

1374
01:57:04,697 --> 01:57:10,702
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been two years, as Council Vice President Knight mentioned, give us the opportunity to unite around this issue.

1375
01:57:11,262 --> 01:57:15,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, whatever ultimately happens, happens, but don't take this issue away from us.

1376
01:57:15,545 --> 01:57:20,209
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that that's what I'm going to be on Thursday night, asking them to continue the meeting once again.

1377
01:57:20,569 --> 01:57:21,750
[SPEAKER_14]: They have every right to do so.

1378
01:57:22,030 --> 01:57:23,111
[SPEAKER_14]: Horizon's not going to like that.

1379
01:57:24,039 --> 01:57:27,381
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think every resident that gets on that call, that should be our request.

1380
01:57:27,641 --> 01:57:30,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Continue the meeting to a later date, a date certain.

1381
01:57:31,282 --> 01:57:32,443
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what they're required to do.

1382
01:57:32,963 --> 01:57:34,704
[SPEAKER_14]: So they have to give a date when they're gonna meet again.

1383
01:57:35,264 --> 01:57:41,087
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we have the ability to get together and start meeting and asking some of these questions and looking into the policy.

1384
01:57:41,107 --> 01:57:43,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of my colleagues brought up some great points.

1385
01:57:43,648 --> 01:57:52,792
[SPEAKER_14]: We were told that night, and I think Councilor Morell mentioned this, that I actually mentioned that at the meeting, whether or not if we got some changes to the interim policy,

1386
01:57:53,268 --> 01:57:54,468
[SPEAKER_14]: would they go into effect?

1387
01:57:54,908 --> 01:58:03,570
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were told by KP Law, which is a firm that's hired by the administration that appeared to be on the side of Verizon, but that's a whole other story.

1388
01:58:05,711 --> 01:58:13,152
[SPEAKER_14]: We were told that whatever changes we make to the interim policy would not have a direct impact on these current applications.

1389
01:58:13,912 --> 01:58:14,732
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we were told.

1390
01:58:15,273 --> 01:58:21,874
[SPEAKER_14]: So knowing that, knowing that we have to do a lot of work with the interim policy, I think the best thing to do is a continuation

1391
01:58:22,250 --> 01:58:25,371
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can figure out what our next steps are as a community.

1392
01:58:25,651 --> 01:58:26,632
[SPEAKER_14]: This is far too important.

1393
01:58:26,972 --> 01:58:27,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry for being so long.

1394
01:58:28,032 --> 01:58:28,652
[SPEAKER_05]: That's okay.

1395
01:58:28,932 --> 01:58:45,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Does a city solicitor, has she weighed in on any of this interim policy that it is the new ones could follow under the new policy, but the old ones don't follow under the old policy?

1396
01:58:45,498 --> 01:58:48,199
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't heard the city solicitor's response to that.

1397
01:58:48,299 --> 01:58:51,180
[SPEAKER_14]: All I heard was KP law, which is a high,

1398
01:58:51,604 --> 01:58:54,125
[SPEAKER_14]: outside firm that's hired by this administration.

1399
01:58:54,365 --> 01:58:57,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Are the citizens of Medford paying for this hired outside firm?

1400
01:58:57,865 --> 01:58:58,866
[SPEAKER_14]: You better believe so.

1401
01:58:59,046 --> 01:59:00,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Through our tax dollars?

1402
01:59:00,226 --> 01:59:00,966
[SPEAKER_05]: You better believe so.

1403
01:59:01,066 --> 01:59:04,247
[SPEAKER_05]: And who does that firm answer to?

1404
01:59:04,267 --> 01:59:05,767
[SPEAKER_05]: The administration.

1405
01:59:05,787 --> 01:59:06,447
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor.

1406
01:59:06,787 --> 01:59:08,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that answers that question.

1407
01:59:09,508 --> 01:59:10,588
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope she's listening.

1408
01:59:11,168 --> 01:59:15,269
[SPEAKER_05]: You promised us a lot, Mrs. Mayor, and you're not delivering.

1409
01:59:15,289 --> 01:59:17,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1410
01:59:18,710 --> 01:59:20,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other residents would like to speak?

1411
01:59:20,970 --> 01:59:22,691
[SPEAKER_14]: before we motion for a vote.

1412
01:59:22,711 --> 01:59:32,517
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank everyone who came up with this evening to voice your opinion and this is what it's about, coming here, speaking your opinion.

1413
01:59:32,697 --> 01:59:48,166
[SPEAKER_14]: So, on the motion by Councilor Max, on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, and we have,

1414
01:59:49,675 --> 01:59:50,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, questions.

1415
01:59:51,196 --> 01:59:51,676
[SPEAKER_14]: We have an eight.

1416
01:59:51,756 --> 01:59:54,297
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the beat paper, uh, by counselor beers.

1417
01:59:54,637 --> 01:59:58,118
[SPEAKER_14]: And we also have a, um, a C paper by our counselor morale.

1418
01:59:58,438 --> 02:00:02,200
[SPEAKER_14]: The counselor that is asking that we vote on them, uh, on one package.

1419
02:00:03,961 --> 02:00:04,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Does everybody agree to that?

1420
02:00:04,941 --> 02:00:11,003
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to have a second, second, seconded by council marks.

1421
02:00:12,264 --> 02:00:12,524
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1422
02:00:12,564 --> 02:00:13,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clark.

1423
02:00:13,184 --> 02:00:17,125
[SPEAKER_02]: This is to consolidate all the papers and amendments.

1424
02:00:17,245 --> 02:00:17,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1425
02:00:19,104 --> 02:00:19,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears?

1426
02:00:20,405 --> 02:00:20,685

02:00:22,626 --> 02:00:22,926

[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks?

1432
02:00:26,087 --> 02:00:26,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1433
02:00:26,588 --> 02:00:27,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Morell?

1434
02:00:27,628 --> 02:00:27,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1435
02:00:28,749 --> 02:00:29,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1436
02:00:29,869 --> 02:00:30,189
Yes.

1437
02:00:30,530 --> 02:00:31,370
[SPEAKER_02]: President Caraviello?

1438
02:00:31,410 --> 02:00:34,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, seven affirmative motions passes.

[SPEAKER_14]: And the motion on the original paper.

1440
02:00:39,034 --> 02:00:39,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

02:00:40,094 --> 02:00:41,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Fevella.

1442
02:00:41,255 --> 02:00:42,415

1443
02:00:47,318 --> 02:00:47,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears?

1444
02:00:48,595 --> 02:00:48,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1445
02:00:49,696 --> 02:00:50,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Felco?

1446
02:00:50,437 --> 02:00:50,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1447
02:00:51,357 --> 02:00:52,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight?

1448
02:00:52,238 --> 02:00:52,458
Yes.

1449
02:00:52,759 --> 02:00:53,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks?

1450
02:00:53,719 --> 02:00:54,020
Yes.

1451
02:00:54,380 --> 02:00:54,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell?

1452
02:00:55,401 --> 02:00:55,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1453
02:00:56,522 --> 02:00:57,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1454
02:00:57,502 --> 02:00:57,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1455
02:00:57,943 --> 02:00:58,744
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello?

1456
02:00:58,824 --> 02:00:59,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1457
02:00:59,044 --> 02:01:01,326
[SPEAKER_14]: I move the motion passes.

1458
02:01:01,346 --> 02:01:15,277
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1, 3-1-1, offered by Councilor Bears, being resolved at the Medford City Council, that we celebrate March 31st, International Transgender Day of Visibility and show our support for our transgender neighbors and friends.

1459
02:01:15,317 --> 02:01:15,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears?

1460
02:01:16,687 --> 02:01:17,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1461
02:01:17,648 --> 02:01:27,674
[SPEAKER_11]: I put this on the agenda a little bit after the fact, but it was after actually seeing a lot of messages from trans and non-binary residents of the city, people who I'm friends with.

1462
02:01:29,435 --> 02:01:30,896
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been a very difficult time.

1463
02:01:30,916 --> 02:01:45,966
[SPEAKER_11]: There've been a lot of laws that are being put forward to the extent of even preventing, you know, transgender youth from getting health, you know, any help from their doctors, any healthcare services,

1464
02:01:46,858 --> 02:01:55,603
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was a very important day for a lot of my friends and a lot of people I know to make it clear that trans and non binary people are here.

1465
02:01:56,043 --> 02:01:58,564
[SPEAKER_11]: They're here to stay and they have the rights of everybody else.

1466
02:01:58,684 --> 02:02:00,445
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's my intention putting this forward.

1467
02:02:00,926 --> 02:02:04,007
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution.

1468
02:02:04,808 --> 02:02:05,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Second motion.

1469
02:02:06,448 --> 02:02:07,229
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1470
02:02:07,889 --> 02:02:08,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1471
02:02:08,810 --> 02:02:10,771
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Councilor bears for bringing this forward.

1472
02:02:12,231 --> 02:02:31,521
[SPEAKER_09]: This year marked the first time the state had a presidential proclamation, and it remains really more important than ever to celebrate and recognize transgender and non-binary people, and also acknowledge the violence and discrimination that many transgender and non-binary people, especially trans women of color and black trans women still face.

1473
02:02:32,141 --> 02:02:39,164
[SPEAKER_09]: So as Councilor Bears alluded to, I want to note that so far, and this is as of last week, according to the HRC, there are 192

1474
02:02:40,689 --> 02:02:45,152
[SPEAKER_09]: anti LGBTQ bills under consideration state legislatures across the country at this time.

1475
02:02:45,752 --> 02:02:48,854
[SPEAKER_09]: And of those 93 directly target transgender people.

1476
02:02:49,774 --> 02:02:52,556
[SPEAKER_09]: So this resolution is very important.

1477
02:02:52,636 --> 02:02:53,516
[SPEAKER_09]: And I very much support it.

1478
02:02:53,536 --> 02:02:54,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1479
02:02:55,257 --> 02:02:57,539
[SPEAKER_14]: Second by Councilor Scarpelli.

1480
02:02:57,559 --> 02:02:59,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1481
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:01,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Bears?

1482
02:03:01,701 --> 02:03:01,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1483
02:03:02,902 --> 02:03:03,542
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco?

1484
02:03:03,622 --> 02:03:03,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1485
02:03:04,242 --> 02:03:04,923
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight?

1486
02:03:04,943 --> 02:03:05,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1487
02:03:06,043 --> 02:03:06,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks?

1488
02:03:06,804 --> 02:03:07,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1489
02:03:07,564 --> 02:03:08,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell?

1490
02:03:08,485 --> 02:03:08,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1491
02:03:09,616 --> 02:03:10,336
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1492
02:03:10,397 --> 02:03:11,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1493
02:03:12,058 --> 02:03:13,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, affirmative.

1494
02:03:13,339 --> 02:03:14,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1495
02:03:14,079 --> 02:03:32,211
[SPEAKER_14]: 2-1, 3-1-2, offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved that the Medford City Council express its support of Bill 3207 and Bill 2-1-2-9, an act relative to the payments in lieu of taxation by organizations exempt from the property tax.

1496
02:03:32,231 --> 02:03:37,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council express its support of House Bill 1469, an act granting

1497
02:03:39,423 --> 02:03:46,487
[SPEAKER_14]: same method, the authority to require the adoption of institutional master plans subject to the review of the municipality.

1498
02:03:46,887 --> 02:03:58,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it further resolved that the city clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the method list legislative delegation, as well as House Speaker Mariano and Senate President Spilka.

1499
02:03:58,653 --> 02:03:59,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears.

1500
02:04:00,373 --> 02:04:01,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1501
02:04:01,374 --> 02:04:06,476
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is, these items are in regards to pilot payments in lieu of taxes.

1502
02:04:06,536 --> 02:04:07,457
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we've discussed this.

1503
02:04:08,104 --> 02:04:12,386
[SPEAKER_11]: many times, as well as accountability for tax-exempt institutions in our community.

1504
02:04:12,406 --> 02:04:18,409
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first resolve is regarding HD 3207 and SD 2129.

1505
02:04:20,810 --> 02:04:35,958
[SPEAKER_11]: That is a bill currently pending in the legislature that would allow cities and towns to enact a local option around pilots, requiring the 25% of what would otherwise be paid if these institutions were not tax-exempt.

1506
02:04:36,533 --> 02:04:36,713
[SPEAKER_11]: the city.

1507
02:04:36,773 --> 02:04:41,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, as you know, pilots are voluntary, and we've actually had an example very recently.

1508
02:04:42,037 --> 02:04:46,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Harvard Vanguard down in the square used to provide a pilot payment to the city.

1509
02:04:46,621 --> 02:04:52,966
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a large building worth a lot of money, and it doesn't currently pay property taxes because it has an exempt purpose.

1510
02:04:53,746 --> 02:04:57,149
[SPEAKER_11]: They are no longer providing that pilot payment to the community.

1511
02:04:57,850 --> 02:05:04,255
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is because they decided not to, and they refused to come to the table with the city to negotiate a pilot agreement.

1512
02:05:05,235 --> 02:05:05,836
[SPEAKER_11]: So this would

1513
02:05:06,365 --> 02:05:15,375
[SPEAKER_11]: legislation would allow under state law cities and towns to have the local option to have pilots being non voluntary.

1514
02:05:16,176 --> 02:05:23,704
[SPEAKER_11]: The second piece of this HD 1469 is regarding the institutional master plan home rule petition.

1515
02:05:24,925 --> 02:05:26,467
[SPEAKER_11]: It was approved by this council

1516
02:05:27,151 --> 02:05:46,579
[SPEAKER_11]: prior to 2020, and Representative Barber filed it again for this new legislative session, and that would require Tufts and large tax exempt institutions to provide master plans to the city so that we can review and approve their plans for expansion.

1517
02:05:46,599 --> 02:05:52,341
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the context here, and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this resolution.

1518
02:05:52,361 --> 02:05:53,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1519
02:05:57,521 --> 02:06:06,285
[SPEAKER_14]: I think President Biden is going to know my name after tonight, maybe President Spilka, maybe House Representative, Speaker of the House.

1520
02:06:06,986 --> 02:06:11,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I'd ask that these papers be referred to the Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Affairs at this point in time.

1521
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:13,169
[SPEAKER_14]: They have docket numbers.

1522
02:06:13,569 --> 02:06:14,629
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I mean?

1523
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:15,730
[SPEAKER_14]: I said it last time.

1524
02:06:16,246 --> 02:06:22,069
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we're foraying into the forbidden world of being state representatives and state senators these days.

1525
02:06:22,129 --> 02:06:26,190
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like we're talking a little bit more about national politics and state politics than we are about local stuff.

1526
02:06:26,771 --> 02:06:31,613
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'd like to take a look at these bills in a little bit more depth to see what impact it's going to have on our community.

1527
02:06:32,353 --> 02:06:34,354
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we have a number of tax-exempt organizations.

1528
02:06:34,854 --> 02:06:37,416
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a number of tax-exempt organizations that are struggling through this pandemic.

1529
02:06:38,296 --> 02:06:44,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Nonprofit organizations that do provide some good to this community, and I might be concerned about the impact that a mandatory 25% tax would have on them.

1530
02:06:45,860 --> 02:06:47,882
[SPEAKER_14]: However, it doesn't mean I'm opposed to it, Mr. President.

1531
02:06:47,902 --> 02:06:50,203
[SPEAKER_14]: It means that I want some more information before I'm comfortable voting for it.

1532
02:06:50,464 --> 02:06:54,166
[SPEAKER_14]: So it has to just be referred to the subcommittee on intergovernmental relations for further study.

1533
02:06:54,566 --> 02:06:55,887
[SPEAKER_14]: I second that, Mr. President.

1534
02:06:56,408 --> 02:06:58,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1535
02:06:58,429 --> 02:07:02,512
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1536
02:07:03,433 --> 02:07:03,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bass.

1537
02:07:05,014 --> 02:07:05,914
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1538
02:07:05,934 --> 02:07:06,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1539
02:07:06,955 --> 02:07:09,297
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to make the point that this is about home rule authority.

1540
02:07:09,907 --> 02:07:15,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And it is a local issue, and we should have the local authority to address these on our own, but state law currently prohibits that.

1541
02:07:15,990 --> 02:07:18,191
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's why these have been put forward.

1542
02:07:18,671 --> 02:07:25,334
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, I appreciate Councilor Knights wanting to look at it further.

1543
02:07:25,354 --> 02:07:28,276
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd be happy to discuss that more.

1544
02:07:30,483 --> 02:07:31,943
[SPEAKER_11]: it would provide us a local option.

1545
02:07:31,983 --> 02:07:38,925
[SPEAKER_11]: We wouldn't be making a decision tonight to mandate it, and it would still require a state law to pass, and it would still require an ordinance and discussion of the council.

1546
02:07:38,965 --> 02:07:42,746
[SPEAKER_11]: So there would be ample public process before anything would be instituted.

1547
02:07:42,766 --> 02:07:45,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of personal privilege, Mr. President?

1548
02:07:46,666 --> 02:07:48,667
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of personal privilege, Vice President Knight.

1549
02:07:48,947 --> 02:07:55,068
[SPEAKER_02]: Having worked in the legislature for a number of years, I've witnessed firsthand the fact that nothing ever comes out the way it goes in.

1550
02:08:00,883 --> 02:08:05,686
[SPEAKER_14]: have they been assigned the host number yet does not appear so thank you.

1551
02:08:06,407 --> 02:08:08,428
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Eric.

1552
02:08:08,448 --> 02:08:14,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record please.

1553
02:08:16,875 --> 02:08:17,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on.

1554
02:08:17,275 --> 02:08:17,895
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1555
02:08:17,975 --> 02:08:22,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Eric von Berg 369 High Street.

1556
02:08:27,556 --> 02:08:30,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, President Caraviello and members of the city council.

1557
02:08:30,999 --> 02:08:35,502
[SPEAKER_06]: I am the Medford co-chair of the Medford-Somerville Pilot Working Group.

1558
02:08:36,583 --> 02:08:52,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are bills that we've worked hard to get in front of the legislature that would give the option to create pilot ordinances and to collect pilot taxes.

1559
02:08:52,456 --> 02:08:55,338
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't mean that the community has to do anything.

1560
02:08:55,879 --> 02:08:58,880
[SPEAKER_06]: but it will give the option for doing that.

1561
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:11,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why we're looking for support for this to get it in and get it more than just a docket number to get it to be a resolution.

1562
02:09:12,486 --> 02:09:21,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is really an important bill because of the budget shortfalls in the community and the money that is lost

1563
02:09:23,579 --> 02:09:34,362
[SPEAKER_06]: in communities that nonprofits don't pay taxes for, and I think it's really important that the city council vote in favor of this.

1564
02:09:36,463 --> 02:09:44,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you for my time, and thank you for the support you may give.

1565
02:09:45,025 --> 02:09:45,386
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1566
02:09:45,666 --> 02:09:47,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caput.

1567
02:09:47,126 --> 02:09:47,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1568
02:09:47,906 --> 02:09:49,767
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand Councilor Bears

1569
02:09:51,070 --> 02:10:04,075
[SPEAKER_14]: attempts, but I too follow with Councilor Knight's thought process of what this would do to a lot of nonprofits that are really taking a beating and do provide a huge benefit for our community.

1570
02:10:04,095 --> 02:10:12,597
[SPEAKER_14]: So I understand that the concept when you're talking about the Tufts universities, the Harvard vanguards, but they're a lot smaller.

1571
02:10:12,677 --> 02:10:19,880
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think in discussion before I would vote on anything positively with this, I think that Councilor Knight is correct in

1572
02:10:20,458 --> 02:10:25,343
[SPEAKER_14]: I would extend more of a discussion to understand it in depth.

1573
02:10:25,423 --> 02:10:27,725
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would second Councilor Knight's motion.

1574
02:10:29,667 --> 02:10:30,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Further discussion?

1575
02:10:31,629 --> 02:10:34,651
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1576
02:10:35,893 --> 02:10:36,253
[SPEAKER_11]: If I may.

1577
02:10:36,673 --> 02:10:38,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Miss.

1578
02:10:39,136 --> 02:10:39,936
[SPEAKER_11]: And I hear that.

1579
02:10:39,976 --> 02:10:42,679
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to maybe lay some concerns off the bat that

1580
02:10:43,206 --> 02:10:55,309
[SPEAKER_11]: The language that was in the bills that were in our packets this week would only apply to institutions with greater than $15 million in exempt property, so wouldn't apply to many of those small nonprofit organizations in our community.

1581
02:10:55,849 --> 02:11:01,871
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would ask that the Intergovernmental Affairs Subcommittee meet within 90 days to discuss the issue.

1582
02:11:01,891 --> 02:11:05,512
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

1583
02:11:08,659 --> 02:11:16,922
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion by Vice President Knight, as amended by Councilor Bears to meet within 90 days.

1584
02:11:17,282 --> 02:11:18,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1585
02:11:18,763 --> 02:11:19,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1586
02:11:24,225 --> 02:11:24,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears?

1587
02:11:25,385 --> 02:11:25,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1588
02:11:26,626 --> 02:11:27,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Fevella?

1589
02:11:27,346 --> 02:11:27,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1590
02:11:28,306 --> 02:11:29,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight?

1591
02:11:29,467 --> 02:11:29,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1592
02:11:30,567 --> 02:11:31,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks?

1593
02:11:31,367 --> 02:11:31,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1594
02:11:32,268 --> 02:11:32,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell?

1595
02:11:33,288 --> 02:11:33,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1596
02:11:34,509 --> 02:11:35,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1597
02:11:35,269 --> 02:11:35,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1598
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:36,691
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello.

1599
02:11:36,851 --> 02:11:47,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm in the permanent motion passes to 1313 offered by Council Falco be resolved that the administration provide the city, Medford City Council with an itemized list of how the $250,000 was spent

1600
02:11:49,824 --> 02:11:52,846
[SPEAKER_14]: from the Clair Channel billboard agreement, Councilor Falco.

1601
02:11:53,147 --> 02:11:54,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1602
02:11:54,287 --> 02:12:12,361
[SPEAKER_03]: As our budget season is quickly approaching, it is time to look at all of our various accounts to see where money is and how it's being spent and to make sure that we finish the year in good shape and start off the next fiscal year in good shape.

1603
02:12:12,802 --> 02:12:16,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in 2010, then Mayor McGlynn signed a billboard agreement with Clair Channel.

1604
02:12:17,834 --> 02:12:32,302
[SPEAKER_03]: And the agreement stated that Clear Channel would make a lump payment, an impact fee payment to the city in the year, in the 11th year of the agreement, which would be fiscal year 2021 of $250,000.

1605
02:12:32,982 --> 02:12:40,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And I came across this through some research, basically after the budget was passed.

1606
02:12:40,947 --> 02:12:45,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I asked the administration, I was told that this was not factored into the budget,

1607
02:12:47,176 --> 02:12:49,177
[SPEAKER_03]: And that came from the CFO.

1608
02:12:49,698 --> 02:12:52,539
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was forwarded on to the chief of staff, Dave Rodriguez.

1609
02:12:53,540 --> 02:13:02,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave did tell me that they learned of the payment after the budget was prepared and therefore was not part of the budget.

1610
02:13:02,205 --> 02:13:05,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point in time, I asked, well, how's the money being spent?

1611
02:13:06,368 --> 02:13:12,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And the explanation I received was that the city's current plan is to use it for one time unanticipated costs

1612
02:13:13,544 --> 02:13:17,986
[SPEAKER_03]: and emergency health safety costs that cannot be covered by the CARES or FEMA.

1613
02:13:18,886 --> 02:13:27,570
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, let's see, there's an engineer that contacted the mayor's office in a panic that the road work at the bottom of Bedford High School is scheduled to be done.

1614
02:13:28,370 --> 02:13:36,313
[SPEAKER_03]: This is back in August, that they didn't have enough, let's see, that the, was gonna be canceled due to not having necessary funds available.

1615
02:13:36,833 --> 02:13:42,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mayor was able to okay this by using these funds from, that they had from the,

1616
02:13:44,258 --> 02:13:45,679
[SPEAKER_03]: from the impact fee.

1617
02:13:46,239 --> 02:13:52,762
[SPEAKER_03]: The section of Harris Park did not have fence, which the city staff were concerned about from a safety perspective.

1618
02:13:53,503 --> 02:13:56,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were able to repair this using these funds.

1619
02:13:57,765 --> 02:14:02,907
[SPEAKER_03]: They used these funds for roading control in response to complaints received throughout the community.

1620
02:14:02,927 --> 02:14:12,292
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also used it for road and safety, pedestrian improvements around the city, particularly around the schools.

1621
02:14:12,796 --> 02:14:27,228
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a plan for the funds, but as we approach the budget season, I'd like to get a full detailed listing of exactly how these funds were spent and how much was spent on each of these projects.

1622
02:14:27,268 --> 02:14:41,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we could get, so basically if I could get a detailed itemized listing of how the $250,000 was spent from the billboard agreements, and if we could send that to the CFO and to the chief of staff.

1623
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:44,013
[SPEAKER_03]: I greatly appreciate and I move approval.

1624
02:14:45,334 --> 02:14:45,915
[SPEAKER_14]: President.

1625
02:14:47,576 --> 02:15:00,707
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd just like to move to further amend the paper in that request that we get a copy of the agreement, as well as all associated public documents that go along with the clear channel billboard mitigation agreements pilot program.

1626
02:15:02,368 --> 02:15:03,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1627
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:11,672
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Knight.

1628
02:15:11,692 --> 02:15:12,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1629
02:15:17,714 --> 02:15:18,314

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1631
02:15:19,795 --> 02:15:20,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco?

1632
02:15:21,255 --> 02:15:21,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1633
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:22,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight?

1634
02:15:22,756 --> 02:15:23,036
Yes.

1635
02:15:23,256 --> 02:15:23,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks?

1636
02:15:24,176 --> 02:15:24,497
Yes.

1637
02:15:24,777 --> 02:15:25,437
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell?

1638
02:15:25,857 --> 02:15:26,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1639
02:15:26,917 --> 02:15:27,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1640
02:15:27,818 --> 02:15:28,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1641
02:15:28,358 --> 02:15:29,178
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello?

1642
02:15:29,218 --> 02:15:29,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1643
02:15:29,438 --> 02:15:30,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in the affirmative.

1644
02:15:30,499 --> 02:15:31,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1645
02:15:33,081 --> 02:15:42,404
[SPEAKER_14]: 21314, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Medford Police Department place the speed trailer at the intersection of Belzab and Hickory Ave in the interest of public safety.

1646
02:15:42,544 --> 02:15:43,325
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

1647
02:15:43,525 --> 02:15:44,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1648
02:15:44,705 --> 02:15:47,146
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like someone's been reading the agenda.

1649
02:15:47,246 --> 02:15:49,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I went by yesterday and the speed trailer is there.

1650
02:15:49,647 --> 02:15:50,547
[SPEAKER_03]: It is there.

1651
02:15:50,647 --> 02:15:53,048
[SPEAKER_03]: So that has been put in place.

1652
02:15:53,088 --> 02:15:57,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully it's effective and hopefully it's going to slow down traffic in that area.

1653
02:15:58,130 --> 02:16:00,651
[SPEAKER_03]: As we know, traffic has been a major concern

1654
02:16:01,311 --> 02:16:02,792
[SPEAKER_03]: in that Fells Ave neighborhood.

1655
02:16:02,812 --> 02:16:09,637
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had a Committee of the Whole meeting there back, I think it was in November of last year that was well attended.

1656
02:16:10,697 --> 02:16:15,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the conclusion of that meeting, there was going to be a follow-up Committee of the Whole meeting.

1657
02:16:15,160 --> 02:16:27,949
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would ask if you could please, if I could amend the resolution to request that we have a follow-up Committee of the Whole meeting with regard to all of the safety improvements that have been made

1658
02:16:30,788 --> 02:16:32,329
[SPEAKER_03]: potential of additional improvements.

1659
02:16:32,369 --> 02:16:45,396
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Councilor Mark said we've had some amendments in a previous resolution with regard to, I think it was, no through traffic, I think that's on particular streets, if I remember correctly.

1660
02:16:45,456 --> 02:16:50,019
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we could have a committee of the whole to revisit this issue.

1661
02:16:50,942 --> 02:16:52,482
[SPEAKER_03]: I greatly appreciate it.

1662
02:16:52,502 --> 02:16:53,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1663
02:16:53,783 --> 02:17:02,205
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Falco to have a Committee of the Whole meeting, seconded by Councilor Mark.

1664
02:17:02,225 --> 02:17:03,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1665
02:17:06,466 --> 02:17:07,087

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

Yes.

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1675
02:17:15,449 --> 02:17:16,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1676
02:17:16,229 --> 02:17:16,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1677
02:17:16,889 --> 02:17:17,709
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello?

1678
02:17:17,890 --> 02:17:19,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative, motion passes.

1679
02:17:21,491 --> 02:17:27,713
[SPEAKER_14]: 2135 offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the administration provide the Medford City Council with the following information.

1680
02:17:28,434 --> 02:17:31,075
[SPEAKER_14]: Amount spent on KP Law since inception.

1681
02:17:31,835 --> 02:17:37,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Budget to actuals for the accounts that pertain to KP Law invoices.

1682
02:17:37,397 --> 02:17:38,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

1683
02:17:41,779 --> 02:17:46,921
[SPEAKER_03]: KP Law has been a point of conversation, I think, since they started doing business with the city of Medford.

1684
02:17:46,961 --> 02:17:49,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that there is a, I believe it's a $5,000 a month retainer

1685
02:17:51,474 --> 02:17:54,295
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically 60,000 for the year.

1686
02:17:54,715 --> 02:17:57,955
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's work that they do outside of their general month to month work.

1687
02:17:58,595 --> 02:18:03,176
[SPEAKER_03]: We've asked many questions about the 40B projects that they're working on.

1688
02:18:03,236 --> 02:18:08,017
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't tend to get too much information, but I know that they've been working on it.

1689
02:18:09,037 --> 02:18:12,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I think all of the 40B projects that have come about.

1690
02:18:13,598 --> 02:18:19,979
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I go through the detailed bills that we get from the CFO, I have not found any,

1691
02:18:20,529 --> 02:18:26,654
[SPEAKER_03]: KP law invoices that have come through outside of the budget of $5,000 per month.

1692
02:18:29,702 --> 02:18:31,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've gone through, I can't find anything.

1693
02:18:32,104 --> 02:18:40,469
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that various consulates have had many questions about KP Law since their inception into working with the city.

1694
02:18:40,529 --> 02:18:56,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'd like to do is just ask that the administration give us basically breakdown of all the invoices outside of the monthly retainer, a breakdown of all of the invoices that have been paid

1695
02:18:58,294 --> 02:19:04,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically what's outstanding, it seems like, from what I can tell, they've been doing work with us for over a year.

1696
02:19:05,277 --> 02:19:07,437
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like there are no invoices.

1697
02:19:08,098 --> 02:19:10,859
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like the administration hasn't received any invoices to pay.

1698
02:19:11,739 --> 02:19:15,580
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, that's just, it's ludicrous.

1699
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:19,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what company does work, it doesn't build a client.

1700
02:19:21,463 --> 02:19:25,124
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there should have been some sort of invoices that have come in here.

1701
02:19:25,928 --> 02:19:30,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I also like to add to further to find out where, where is that cost spend budgeted in the budget.

1702
02:19:32,689 --> 02:19:38,330
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just seems like KPI just seems like there's a really, it's a lot of, it's a big gray area.

1703
02:19:39,330 --> 02:19:52,793
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look at the budget, it doesn't look like it's budgeted for and from what I can tell, you know, it doesn't look like there are any invoices coming in outside of the $5,000 per month appropriation that has been made.

1704
02:19:56,071 --> 02:20:24,393
[SPEAKER_14]: uh at least the third request for this information and maybe the fourth and i don't know um i don't know why we can't get an answer from the administration so again i thank you for bringing this up again uh for probably at least the third or the fourth time uh again i agree with you that uh offerings don't work for free uh the only son that i know i bet if you find one let me know well i mean we're coming into but we're coming into the budget season this is important information we need to know this

1705
02:20:26,826 --> 02:20:27,386
[SPEAKER_03]: This is vital.

1706
02:20:27,506 --> 02:20:28,266
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to know this.

1707
02:20:28,346 --> 02:20:31,027
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to know how much we're paying them.

1708
02:20:31,587 --> 02:20:32,767
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's outstanding.

1709
02:20:32,787 --> 02:20:36,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I still don't, I don't understand how a law firm does work.

1710
02:20:36,848 --> 02:20:37,668
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't build a client.

1711
02:20:37,708 --> 02:20:40,808
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make any sense.

1712
02:20:41,769 --> 02:20:44,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I share Councilor Falco's concerns wholeheartedly.

1713
02:20:45,069 --> 02:20:47,870
[SPEAKER_14]: As a matter of fact, this is a topic that I've brought up in the past as well.

1714
02:20:48,590 --> 02:20:54,911
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we look at this month's Warren article, this previous month's Warren articles, we'll see that we've received

1715
02:20:56,776 --> 02:21:11,120
[SPEAKER_14]: seven bills of $5,000 to the tune of 30K, Mr. President, for what is labeled as, I'm sorry, six, I'm sorry, six, 30K.

1716
02:21:11,400 --> 02:21:14,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Monthly legal retainer, it says, monthly legal retainer.

1717
02:21:14,221 --> 02:21:15,781
[SPEAKER_14]: So six months, monthly legal retainer.

1718
02:21:16,121 --> 02:21:20,382
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is being paid, Mr. President, out of the professional services legal line item.

1719
02:21:21,122 --> 02:21:23,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, if we go to the previous year's budget,

1720
02:21:24,557 --> 02:21:33,104
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see in the previous year's budget, underneath the law department, if we look for professional and technical services, other, that line item was funded at $1,500.

1721
02:21:33,644 --> 02:21:45,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Now my assumption, Mr. President, is that this line item was not approved in the next year's budget at an amount that would be four or 500 times that amount.

1722
02:21:46,354 --> 02:21:51,278
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, it appears to me that they're doing some deficit spending and come the end of the year, there are gonna be some

1723
02:21:52,059 --> 02:22:03,347
[SPEAKER_14]: little fuzzy math transfers that we're gonna be doing over here to figure out how we're gonna pay for this, Mr. President, because quite frankly, I don't see that it's being paid for out of an account that's funded to the level that it's being built.

1724
02:22:03,988 --> 02:22:07,951
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, I thank my council colleague and I support his resolution and I second it.

1725
02:22:08,591 --> 02:22:10,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1726
02:22:10,513 --> 02:22:16,357
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Knight as amended by Councilor Falco.

1727
02:22:17,758 --> 02:22:18,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1728
02:22:21,578 --> 02:22:22,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

1729
02:22:22,759 --> 02:22:22,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1730
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:24,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

1731
02:22:24,860 --> 02:22:25,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1732
02:22:25,541 --> 02:22:26,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

1733
02:22:26,461 --> 02:22:26,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1734
02:22:27,022 --> 02:22:27,622
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

1735
02:22:27,902 --> 02:22:28,222
Yes.

1736
02:22:28,443 --> 02:22:29,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

1737
02:22:29,483 --> 02:22:29,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1738
02:22:30,584 --> 02:22:31,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1739
02:22:31,445 --> 02:22:31,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1740
02:22:32,005 --> 02:22:32,705
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello.

1741
02:22:32,745 --> 02:22:34,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm in affirmative, motion passes.

1742
02:22:36,308 --> 02:22:40,531
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we've gone through all the questions.

1743
02:22:40,651 --> 02:22:41,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, public participation.

1744
02:22:42,672 --> 02:22:44,473
[SPEAKER_14]: By David McKenna, 94 Rockland Road, FMS.

1745
02:22:50,336 --> 02:22:56,641
[SPEAKER_14]: I, David McKibbin, would like the opportunity to discuss public properties in Medford and the procedure of changing said name.

1746
02:22:57,001 --> 02:23:06,548
[SPEAKER_14]: I would further like the clarification on what rights the majority of the city have in being able to have healthy dialogue and discussion when it comes to said changes.

1747
02:23:07,029 --> 02:23:12,973
[SPEAKER_14]: This issue has been a dividing wall in our city, and citizens are not feeling like they have a say in the matter.

1748
02:23:15,155 --> 02:23:16,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Moving to the record, please.

1749
02:23:17,534 --> 02:23:19,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening, David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1750
02:23:19,815 --> 02:23:25,398
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say thank you for allowing me to have the opportunity to speak on this situation.

1751
02:23:25,778 --> 02:23:45,548
[SPEAKER_14]: And the only reason why I'm here right now is because there's a large majority of people that I've spoken to and that really were working really hard to have their voices heard with an issue reference the changes in names of certain buildings in the city of Medford.

1752
02:23:46,568 --> 02:23:55,937
[SPEAKER_14]: And to understand why we're here today, in fact, I was just kind of listening to everything and it was encouraging to see how unified we all got behind the 5G situation.

1753
02:23:55,977 --> 02:24:00,161
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope that somewhere along the line, we can get unified in many other areas in the city.

1754
02:24:00,201 --> 02:24:05,967
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's unfortunate that we can unify on one situation and then divide in another situation.

1755
02:24:05,987 --> 02:24:10,772
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's where we're at right now with this process.

1756
02:24:11,719 --> 02:24:17,582
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why I'm here is to talk a little bit about a recent change and the way it went down in June 6th.

1757
02:24:18,382 --> 02:24:24,304
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a decision and a vote that one of the buildings in Metro would be changed with the name.

1758
02:24:25,205 --> 02:24:31,307
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was kind of, the way the process went was people felt like they weren't heard.

1759
02:24:31,387 --> 02:24:33,528
[SPEAKER_14]: People felt they didn't even have the opportunity to speak.

1760
02:24:34,309 --> 02:24:37,170
[SPEAKER_14]: And even in the patch, I know that it was the,

1761
02:24:38,530 --> 02:24:46,937
[SPEAKER_14]: the final hour that it was presented on the patch that there was the opportunity for people to speak in a meeting for this change.

1762
02:24:47,578 --> 02:24:51,301
[SPEAKER_14]: And then about two or three weeks ago, we had the opportunity again to speak.

1763
02:24:51,581 --> 02:24:59,968
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke, I know I spoke on a Monday night and really tried to kind of tug at the sympathy and the respect of

1764
02:25:00,748 --> 02:25:12,394
[SPEAKER_14]: the people that feel disenfranchised, and the reason why they feel disenfranchised, and please indulge me in a little bit of a history lesson, and I'm sure some of you know this, why the heck is a guy with the name McKillop even interested in this?

1765
02:25:12,914 --> 02:25:22,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, my mom's maiden name is Joanne Camela Labasse, so I'm just as interested in what's going on as anyone else that's interested in this.

1766
02:25:23,419 --> 02:25:30,443
[SPEAKER_14]: Columbus, it is something that is of historic significance for not just the name and not just the person,

1767
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:32,441
[SPEAKER_14]: but for the reason behind it.

1768
02:25:33,282 --> 02:25:39,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Columbus is a word now that symbolizes something that's very important to the Italian-American community.

1769
02:25:39,888 --> 02:25:46,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Columbus, back in the 1800s for Italian-Americans, was a person that did do a lot of discovery.

1770
02:25:47,094 --> 02:25:54,281
[SPEAKER_14]: But in the late 1800s, 1890s, I don't know if a lot of you know this, but Italian-Americans were treated very poorly.

1771
02:25:54,741 --> 02:25:57,524
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I would go as far as to say like dirt.

1772
02:25:58,510 --> 02:26:05,715
[SPEAKER_14]: They were treated so poorly that there were certain Italian-Americans that were accused of a murder they did not commit and were acquitted.

1773
02:26:06,656 --> 02:26:07,877
[SPEAKER_14]: And people didn't like that.

1774
02:26:08,257 --> 02:26:12,740
[SPEAKER_14]: So they actually pulled these people, dragged these people out of a jail and they lynched them.

1775
02:26:13,701 --> 02:26:14,441
[SPEAKER_14]: They lynched them.

1776
02:26:15,942 --> 02:26:17,764
[SPEAKER_14]: They lynched Italian-Americans.

1777
02:26:19,025 --> 02:26:20,406
[SPEAKER_14]: And this got so bad.

1778
02:26:20,866 --> 02:26:26,330
[SPEAKER_14]: This got so bad in the United States that two countries were separating because of it.

1779
02:26:27,366 --> 02:26:28,987
[SPEAKER_14]: the United States and Italy.

1780
02:26:30,128 --> 02:26:33,150
[SPEAKER_14]: Dignitaries from Italy were removed from the United States.

1781
02:26:33,270 --> 02:26:37,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Dignitaries from the United States were removed from Italy in the 1800s.

1782
02:26:39,113 --> 02:26:47,418
[SPEAKER_14]: Imagine this situation and how it catapulted the Italian American community into a totally different level.

1783
02:26:47,538 --> 02:26:56,504
[SPEAKER_14]: In 1891, the president of the United States recognized what was going on, recognized that this just cannot continue.

1784
02:26:57,253 --> 02:27:01,115
[SPEAKER_14]: So he did something unprecedented in its time.

1785
02:27:02,015 --> 02:27:11,980
[SPEAKER_14]: He went and he offered condolences and money to the families of the lynched Italian-Americans to help them offset the situation.

1786
02:27:12,380 --> 02:27:14,001
[SPEAKER_14]: He also took it one step further.

1787
02:27:15,021 --> 02:27:20,784
[SPEAKER_14]: And with the help of the Italian consulate, he created a day

1788
02:27:21,283 --> 02:27:26,186
[SPEAKER_14]: of remembrance and gathering and family, and that was called Columbus Day.

1789
02:27:26,246 --> 02:27:31,629
[SPEAKER_14]: It was only supposed to be one event, one event, and then it goes away.

1790
02:27:32,289 --> 02:27:41,434
[SPEAKER_14]: That became so important to the Italian American community because what it did was it took them away from a racist situation.

1791
02:27:41,994 --> 02:27:43,215
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is, that's the word.

1792
02:27:43,875 --> 02:27:50,579
[SPEAKER_14]: This was a tool, a facility that the president of the United States put together

1793
02:27:51,229 --> 02:27:59,693
[SPEAKER_14]: with Italy to remove racism or help move the Italian-American community closer to inclusiveness.

1794
02:28:00,514 --> 02:28:19,483
[SPEAKER_14]: It became so important that it became Columbus Day, that it was so important to the Italian-American community that Italy itself created a statue, not unlike the Statue of Liberty, and sent it over to the United States in response to what the president did.

1795
02:28:20,362 --> 02:28:25,766
[SPEAKER_14]: So Columbus is not Christopher Columbus, the person, not just that anymore.

1796
02:28:25,786 --> 02:28:30,910
[SPEAKER_14]: And by the way, looking at a person through the lenses of today, shame on us.

1797
02:28:32,031 --> 02:28:32,632
[SPEAKER_14]: Shame on us.

1798
02:28:33,872 --> 02:28:37,595
[SPEAKER_14]: The history that people are talking about, the jury is still out on that.

1799
02:28:38,016 --> 02:28:39,016
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not quite sure.

1800
02:28:40,638 --> 02:28:43,400
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's really just understand where we are today.

1801
02:28:44,761 --> 02:28:50,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Christopher Columbus and that statue meant a heck of a lot more to Italian American people

1802
02:28:50,489 --> 02:28:52,430
[SPEAKER_14]: than what is perceived as of today.

1803
02:28:52,991 --> 02:28:59,716
[SPEAKER_14]: I was really happy and kudos to Councilor Bears for bringing out the transgender day.

1804
02:29:00,596 --> 02:29:01,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of the same thing.

1805
02:29:02,217 --> 02:29:02,878
[SPEAKER_14]: It's interesting.

1806
02:29:03,458 --> 02:29:12,705
[SPEAKER_14]: We could bring out a transgender day and yet we can start to remove this icon of a name from buildings.

1807
02:29:13,225 --> 02:29:16,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I'm hearing that it's being considered to be removed from parks.

1808
02:29:17,867 --> 02:29:20,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I'm hearing that we're moving on to other names.

1809
02:29:20,948 --> 02:29:22,549
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, where does this end?

1810
02:29:22,689 --> 02:29:24,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Where does this go and where does this end?

1811
02:29:25,130 --> 02:29:32,554
[SPEAKER_14]: At what point do we start taking a stand and saying, this is our community, let's breathe through the nose.

1812
02:29:32,974 --> 02:29:38,937
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we're going to make changes, first of all, I want you all to understand, we know the decision was made.

1813
02:29:39,397 --> 02:29:44,560
[SPEAKER_14]: We also know it has nothing to do with the city council in the respect of making that decision.

1814
02:29:45,360 --> 02:29:47,141
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not what we're here for today.

1815
02:29:47,642 --> 02:29:50,463
[SPEAKER_14]: We're here to say our voices were not heard.

1816
02:29:51,164 --> 02:29:56,927
[SPEAKER_14]: When we had the opportunity to be heard, we were given two minute intervals and we were asked not to repeat.

1817
02:29:57,447 --> 02:30:02,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Not unlike the part that you're frustrated with, with 5G, right?

1818
02:30:02,730 --> 02:30:04,190
[SPEAKER_14]: You are very frustrated with that.

1819
02:30:04,711 --> 02:30:11,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Imagine the people on that Zoom meeting because, and no disrespect to anyone, we can't come here to talk to the city council.

1820
02:30:12,054 --> 02:30:13,455
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have to talk to them on Zoom.

1821
02:30:14,867 --> 02:30:17,909
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, on school committee, my apologies.

1822
02:30:17,949 --> 02:30:23,372
[SPEAKER_14]: So we had to talk to them on Zoom and we were given two minute intervals and asked not to repeat ourselves.

1823
02:30:25,213 --> 02:30:27,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't even get a point across in two minutes, I'm sorry.

1824
02:30:28,154 --> 02:30:30,876
[SPEAKER_14]: And I tend to be a bit long-winded, so I like to speak.

1825
02:30:32,237 --> 02:30:38,040
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's the reason why I'm here today, to let the city council know there is a group of disenfranchised

1826
02:30:39,261 --> 02:30:41,162
[SPEAKER_14]: people in the city of Medford.

1827
02:30:41,702 --> 02:30:48,186
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't make any sense to me that we can allow that when we're talking about so many other things that address those issues.

1828
02:30:49,267 --> 02:30:50,547
[SPEAKER_14]: So we need to work together.

1829
02:30:51,228 --> 02:30:52,308
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to come together.

1830
02:30:52,348 --> 02:30:56,771
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to start getting back to the gravity zero center of the city.

1831
02:30:57,543 --> 02:31:00,965
[SPEAKER_14]: and stop extreming everything that we do.

1832
02:31:01,526 --> 02:31:04,007
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a dividing rod for this city.

1833
02:31:04,247 --> 02:31:06,269
[SPEAKER_14]: It's appalling that it's happened.

1834
02:31:06,769 --> 02:31:16,155
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we have elected officials saying, I don't care how many people say they don't want to change, it will be changed.

1835
02:31:17,676 --> 02:31:21,718
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a sign that this city is coming apart.

1836
02:31:23,059 --> 02:31:25,921
[SPEAKER_14]: When we have the people signing a petition

1837
02:31:26,727 --> 02:31:35,710
[SPEAKER_14]: And over 630 people signed that petition and gave it to the school committee and said, hey, we don't want this to happen.

1838
02:31:35,730 --> 02:31:39,691
[SPEAKER_14]: And 300, just over 300 people said, hey, we do want this to happen.

1839
02:31:40,511 --> 02:31:46,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Common mathematics say two thirds of the people do not want it to happen.

1840
02:31:48,333 --> 02:31:50,374
[SPEAKER_14]: When does this stop?

1841
02:31:51,434 --> 02:31:53,255
[SPEAKER_14]: Where do we go from here?

1842
02:31:54,818 --> 02:31:57,840
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we can't communicate here, then where?

1843
02:31:58,761 --> 02:32:01,442
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can't communicate now, then when?

1844
02:32:02,383 --> 02:32:07,386
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we can't communicate to them, and we can't communicate to you, then who?

1845
02:32:08,547 --> 02:32:09,908
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is where we're at today.

1846
02:32:10,608 --> 02:32:13,029
[SPEAKER_14]: So pardon me if I'm a little upset about this.

1847
02:32:13,610 --> 02:32:17,052
[SPEAKER_14]: This was something that was, in my eyes, swept completely under the rug.

1848
02:32:17,452 --> 02:32:18,313
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a done deal.

1849
02:32:18,693 --> 02:32:23,216
[SPEAKER_14]: And now they're putting together a committee to name this building.

1850
02:32:25,347 --> 02:32:30,489
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, but if you read the bylaws of that committee rules, if you don't agree with them, give up.

1851
02:32:32,830 --> 02:32:34,590
[SPEAKER_14]: What kind of a committee is that?

1852
02:32:35,451 --> 02:32:36,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Where are we at?

1853
02:32:37,131 --> 02:32:37,952
[SPEAKER_14]: We need your help.

1854
02:32:38,012 --> 02:32:38,932
[SPEAKER_14]: We need your guidance.

1855
02:32:38,992 --> 02:32:40,153
[SPEAKER_14]: We need some understanding.

1856
02:32:40,653 --> 02:32:42,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is this city going and what is happening?

1857
02:32:43,774 --> 02:32:45,875
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is not gonna stop with just the school.

1858
02:32:46,675 --> 02:32:47,535
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gonna be a park.

1859
02:32:47,955 --> 02:32:48,916
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gonna be a street.

1860
02:32:49,316 --> 02:32:50,276
[SPEAKER_14]: It's gonna be anything else.

1861
02:32:50,376 --> 02:32:51,877
[SPEAKER_14]: And let's take it one step further.

1862
02:32:52,817 --> 02:32:54,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody in the United States

1863
02:32:55,219 --> 02:33:04,867
[SPEAKER_14]: who had done wrong things in their life, paid the price, went to jail, got accosted, and then turned their life around and did good things.

1864
02:33:05,928 --> 02:33:07,429
[SPEAKER_14]: What will history look at them like?

1865
02:33:09,091 --> 02:33:10,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take it in a step further.

1866
02:33:10,772 --> 02:33:17,138
[SPEAKER_14]: A celebrity business person anywhere in the United States makes a donation to another city.

1867
02:33:17,938 --> 02:33:20,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Where do they go when they're looking for that?

1868
02:33:20,300 --> 02:33:21,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. McKillop,

1869
02:33:22,466 --> 02:33:24,287
[SPEAKER_14]: You're coming upon your 10 minute mark.

1870
02:33:24,367 --> 02:33:25,107
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

1871
02:33:25,727 --> 02:33:27,708
[SPEAKER_14]: So I leave you with just this.

1872
02:33:29,089 --> 02:33:31,590
[SPEAKER_14]: What makes the human spirit work is this.

1873
02:33:32,310 --> 02:33:33,851
[SPEAKER_14]: What drives us is this.

1874
02:33:34,791 --> 02:33:41,674
[SPEAKER_14]: What makes us so great is that we are imperfect and we learn from the people before us.

1875
02:33:42,034 --> 02:33:43,374
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't erase them.

1876
02:33:43,775 --> 02:33:44,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1877
02:33:45,035 --> 02:33:45,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1878
02:33:45,535 --> 02:33:52,198
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you know, as you stated, this boy does not have the ability to name schools

1879
02:33:52,620 --> 02:34:02,811
[SPEAKER_14]: And I did a little work today, and the name of parks would have to go before the park board for any change of that.

1880
02:34:03,151 --> 02:34:10,759
[SPEAKER_14]: But as far as buildings, like you see, the city yard got named after Mr. Pompeo.

1881
02:34:11,340 --> 02:34:12,720
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was a decision of the mayor.

1882
02:34:12,920 --> 02:34:16,201
[SPEAKER_14]: You see like in the street corners, those are decisions of the mayor.

1883
02:34:16,801 --> 02:34:21,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Those, I mean, city council can make recommendations, but ultimately it is a decision of the mayor.

1884
02:34:22,263 --> 02:34:24,383
[SPEAKER_14]: I thank you for your time this evening.

1885
02:34:27,564 --> 02:34:28,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Mary Ann Braxton.

1886
02:34:31,585 --> 02:34:31,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Mary Ann.

1887
02:34:31,945 --> 02:34:33,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, thank you.

1888
02:34:33,405 --> 02:34:39,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to start by apologizing because I thought you were actually going to talk about the city of Medford committee housing plan in this meeting this evening.

1889
02:34:40,507 --> 02:34:43,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I would like to address my public comments towards that.

1890
02:34:44,568 --> 02:34:47,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that last week, go ahead.

1891
02:34:48,789 --> 02:34:52,510
[SPEAKER_01]: The city of Medford, um, housing report.

1892
02:34:52,610 --> 02:34:55,551
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not, we're not discussing that this evening, Marianne.

1893
02:34:57,251 --> 02:34:59,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, but may I make a meeting earlier on that?

1894
02:35:00,292 --> 02:35:01,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I know.

1895
02:35:01,132 --> 02:35:07,253
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, that's why I apologized to begin at the beginning of my statement, because I thought it was actually going to be discussed in this one.

1896
02:35:09,926 --> 02:35:15,230
[SPEAKER_14]: The public participation is on something, it's on public properties, not on the housing protection plan.

1897
02:35:17,071 --> 02:35:25,598
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but my comment actually reflects- Mr. President, with all due respect, public participation is an item where individuals in the community can get up and speak.

1898
02:35:25,658 --> 02:35:28,760
[SPEAKER_14]: You can speak on this after we're done.

1899
02:35:29,260 --> 02:35:39,428
[SPEAKER_14]: After we're done speaking on this issue, if you'd like to speak on the housing protection plan, that'll be later in the evening, after we finish this discussion.

1900
02:35:40,222 --> 02:35:40,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

1901
02:35:41,682 --> 02:35:48,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Back point of information is there's not even a discussion of public participation, the individuals come up and they say that we're speaking at this particular issue at the moment.

1902
02:35:50,444 --> 02:35:51,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Come back and speak on that.

1903
02:35:51,304 --> 02:35:58,185
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say though, that this isn't the appropriate forum to debate the, you know, ongoing legacy of Christopher Columbus.

1904
02:35:58,265 --> 02:35:59,005
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not what we have.

1905
02:36:00,565 --> 02:36:01,446
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me just the record, please.

1906
02:36:01,866 --> 02:36:04,066
[SPEAKER_14]: Anthony D'Antonio.

1907
02:36:05,566 --> 02:36:08,067
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a very contentious issue with me.

1908
02:36:09,067 --> 02:36:09,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Columbus

1909
02:36:10,165 --> 02:36:15,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Park, Columbus School, the South Medford neighborhood where it exists.

1910
02:36:16,286 --> 02:36:25,948
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very special to many, many, many Italian-Americans, Irish-Americans, Russians, and so on and so forth, because that was the neighborhood.

1911
02:36:26,608 --> 02:36:29,128
[SPEAKER_14]: The Columbus was not just a school.

1912
02:36:29,528 --> 02:36:30,508
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a family.

1913
02:36:32,089 --> 02:36:39,570
[SPEAKER_14]: My grandfather came from the Southern mines in Italy and busted his hump to realize the American dream.

1914
02:36:41,226 --> 02:36:42,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Never asked for anything.

1915
02:36:43,087 --> 02:36:44,768
[SPEAKER_14]: My other grandfather, same thing.

1916
02:36:45,328 --> 02:36:46,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Donated to that school.

1917
02:36:47,230 --> 02:36:48,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Donated to the St.

1918
02:36:48,530 --> 02:36:49,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Clement Church.

1919
02:36:49,611 --> 02:36:50,492
[SPEAKER_14]: They worked hard.

1920
02:36:50,832 --> 02:36:53,453
[SPEAKER_14]: They never put their hand out like everybody's doing today.

1921
02:36:53,473 --> 02:36:54,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Give me more, give me more.

1922
02:36:55,475 --> 02:36:55,815
[SPEAKER_14]: All right?

1923
02:36:56,435 --> 02:36:57,856
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not just the school.

1924
02:36:58,877 --> 02:37:05,781
[SPEAKER_14]: And shame for this stranger who comes to the city of Medford and decides he doesn't like Italians, so he's gonna change his damn name.

1925
02:37:06,548 --> 02:37:08,349
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, but that's not good.

1926
02:37:08,730 --> 02:37:10,051
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going down that road.

1927
02:37:10,251 --> 02:37:11,492
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we're not going to go down that road.

1928
02:37:11,512 --> 02:37:12,433
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going down that road.

1929
02:37:12,453 --> 02:37:15,415
[SPEAKER_14]: What you're doing is you're taking history away from the people in South Metro.

1930
02:37:15,435 --> 02:37:17,196
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going down that road.

1931
02:37:17,296 --> 02:37:20,439
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they're taking history away from the people in South Metro.

1932
02:37:21,059 --> 02:37:22,700
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't do that, all right?

1933
02:37:23,401 --> 02:37:23,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1934
02:37:23,901 --> 02:37:25,563
[SPEAKER_14]: They ought to do something different with their lives.

1935
02:37:25,683 --> 02:37:25,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1936
02:37:29,746 --> 02:37:30,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

1937
02:37:30,947 --> 02:37:33,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass.

1938
02:37:33,429 --> 02:37:34,830
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a quick follow-up.

1939
02:37:35,953 --> 02:37:40,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Dave McKellar brings up a good point as it related how Italians were treated.

1940
02:37:40,775 --> 02:37:45,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if you go into some of the social media here in Medford, they do take a swipe at Italians.

1941
02:37:45,998 --> 02:37:51,920
[SPEAKER_14]: And I resent that very much, whether I'm Italian American or whether you're Irish American, no matter what it might be.

1942
02:37:52,781 --> 02:38:03,986
[SPEAKER_14]: And if anybody really needs to know, of all the immigrants that came into this country, it was the early Italian Catholics who came into this country as immigrants, and they struggled to make their way

1943
02:38:05,979 --> 02:38:13,143
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were hostilely treated, hostilely treated throughout the entire United States.

1944
02:38:13,203 --> 02:38:15,924
[SPEAKER_14]: In 1785, they wanted to build a church in Manhattan, New York.

1945
02:38:15,964 --> 02:38:17,505
[SPEAKER_14]: This goes back a little bit in history here.

1946
02:38:18,105 --> 02:38:18,445
[SPEAKER_14]: And St.

1947
02:38:18,485 --> 02:38:23,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Peter's Church, which was the heart of where the Catholics made their proposal to build their church.

1948
02:38:24,228 --> 02:38:34,473
[SPEAKER_14]: But the pushback was from the people at that time, they feared the papacy and the sinister foreign influences that was forced upon them to relocate outside the city limits.

1949
02:38:35,287 --> 02:38:48,715
[SPEAKER_14]: And on December 24th, in 1806, two decades after the church was built, on Christmas Eve, there was an enormous, how can you say, meltdown at the church because people just didn't like what was going on.

1950
02:38:49,236 --> 02:38:56,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Resulting from that, on Christmas Eve, there was a protest in which dozens of people were injured and a policeman was killed.

1951
02:38:57,121 --> 02:39:03,805
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the sad part about the early part of immigration as it relates to the Italians here in this country.

1952
02:39:04,571 --> 02:39:24,735
[SPEAKER_14]: And then as Councilor McKillop, excuse me, Mr. McKillop alluded to, on March 14th, 1891, the biggest lynching then and now in the United States of America was against the 10, 11 Italians, falsely accused and acquitted in a court of law of killing a police chief.

1953
02:39:25,455 --> 02:39:29,476
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was a mob riot after that situation that took place.

1954
02:39:29,536 --> 02:39:33,297
[SPEAKER_14]: And because of that mob riot that took place, the then

1955
02:39:33,908 --> 02:39:45,577
[SPEAKER_14]: and he was becoming the president of the United States, Teddy Roosevelt, who everyone thinks he was a great guy, he might be in some people's, he indicated it was rather a good idea that those people were lynched.

1956
02:39:46,478 --> 02:40:03,611
[SPEAKER_14]: And then a gentleman, his name was John Parker, who helped organize the lynching said the following, he said of Italians, that they are just a little worse than the Negro, being if anything filthier in habits, lawlessness and treacherousness.

1957
02:40:04,525 --> 02:40:05,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Why isn't that?

1958
02:40:05,386 --> 02:40:10,689
[SPEAKER_14]: And that today, that today spell, unfortunately, divisiveness that's taking place.

1959
02:40:11,670 --> 02:40:23,378
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford social media, for those people who wouldn't even have the tolerance to allow a different conversation to their revisionary history, has alluded to exactly what Mr. McKillop is talking about.

1960
02:40:24,598 --> 02:40:32,704
[SPEAKER_03]: You just went through a 5G conversation, very nicely and tastefully said and done, and respectfully done.

1961
02:40:33,632 --> 02:40:38,274
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not taking place in the city with this particular Columbus school issue.

1962
02:40:39,355 --> 02:40:53,102
[SPEAKER_14]: You have a former principal, Marie Rizzo, who wrote a very fine letter to the mayor and every school committee person on her thoughts about that name change, and she did not get one response as of last Sunday.

1963
02:40:53,702 --> 02:40:59,505
[SPEAKER_14]: That's total disrespect to a woman who spent over 42 years as an educator here in the city of Medford.

1964
02:41:00,005 --> 02:41:01,086
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we look at the history,

1965
02:41:01,519 --> 02:41:02,439
[SPEAKER_14]: of the Columbus School.

1966
02:41:02,459 --> 02:41:22,906
[SPEAKER_14]: It goes back to September 6, 1929, in the midst of Mercury, where the story goes, it was because of the neighborhood people who got together and raised money for the school, that that's the reason why the then school committee changed the name from the Mystic School to the Columbus School, because they were of Italian American descent.

1967
02:41:24,551 --> 02:41:39,236
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford School Committee and the mayor ought to be ashamed of themselves for not only entertaining this, but now they want to have an intermediary next month before school starts, change the name one month ahead of time, and then go into making a final change.

1968
02:41:40,057 --> 02:41:43,018
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to talk about having kids all screwed up and parents all screwed up.

1969
02:41:43,658 --> 02:41:46,659
[SPEAKER_14]: There it is right there, a school committee that can't even listen to the people.

1970
02:41:47,460 --> 02:41:48,040
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a shame.

1971
02:41:48,900 --> 02:41:53,862
[SPEAKER_14]: What you guys did tonight set the tempo of how a discussion should take place.

1972
02:41:54,502 --> 02:41:58,476
[SPEAKER_14]: The school committee has lost that ability and they've let one person.

1973
02:41:59,329 --> 02:42:05,172
[SPEAKER_14]: another town to come here from two years ago to take over and move an issue.

1974
02:42:05,432 --> 02:42:06,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And move an issue.

1975
02:42:06,572 --> 02:42:07,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mention his name.

1976
02:42:07,533 --> 02:42:08,453
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't mention his name.

1977
02:42:08,573 --> 02:42:10,614
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not going to bring up anybody's character.

1978
02:42:10,694 --> 02:42:12,335
[SPEAKER_14]: I said I didn't mention his name.

1979
02:42:12,475 --> 02:42:13,175
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care.

1980
02:42:13,215 --> 02:42:14,055
[SPEAKER_05]: He's another town.

1981
02:42:14,096 --> 02:42:16,777
[SPEAKER_14]: He came into the community and he changed.

1982
02:42:16,857 --> 02:42:17,497
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll set you up.

1983
02:42:17,597 --> 02:42:18,437
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't set me up.

1984
02:42:18,497 --> 02:42:19,938
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't mention his name, Rick.

1985
02:42:20,078 --> 02:42:21,419
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm asking you to be polite here.

1986
02:42:21,559 --> 02:42:22,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Just get with him.

1987
02:42:22,739 --> 02:42:24,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't be afraid of the truth, Rick.

1988
02:42:25,140 --> 02:42:26,081
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm asking you to be polite.

1989
02:42:27,159 --> 02:42:28,441
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the truth, okay?

1990
02:42:28,701 --> 02:42:29,983
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm asking you to be polite here.

1991
02:42:30,003 --> 02:42:31,906
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not doing anything.

1992
02:42:31,946 --> 02:42:32,807
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not doing anything.

1993
02:42:32,847 --> 02:42:33,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Point of information.

1994
02:42:33,908 --> 02:42:35,611
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm telling you about the school committee.

1995
02:42:36,198 --> 02:42:45,786
[SPEAKER_14]: The school committee- Mr. President, with all due respect, the reason that we created public participation and adjusted it this way was so the councilors and citizens wouldn't get into debates.

1996
02:42:46,307 --> 02:42:57,476
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that the whole idea is that we're gonna sit back, let him say what he's gonna say, and then let's move on because I don't think anybody behind this rail is really interested in having a discussion about whether or not the school committee made the right decision or not, quite frankly.

1997
02:42:57,496 --> 02:43:00,639
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we all have our own opinion on it, but it's not within the purview of this board.

1998
02:43:00,699 --> 02:43:04,202
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel as though it's nothing more than a dog whistle, Mr. President, at this point.

1999
02:43:07,022 --> 02:43:07,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2000
02:43:08,443 --> 02:43:09,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

2001
02:43:09,743 --> 02:43:16,125
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just concluding to say, as Councilor Knight has alluded to, you know, they come here to say whatever our opinion is.

2002
02:43:16,906 --> 02:43:20,287
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the 5G issue basically said the whole story.

2003
02:43:20,587 --> 02:43:21,908
[SPEAKER_14]: You have the opportunity to hear it.

2004
02:43:22,268 --> 02:43:24,088
[SPEAKER_14]: You knew it took place on March 31st.

2005
02:43:24,348 --> 02:43:26,829
[SPEAKER_14]: You're not going to hopefully have the same thing on Thursday night.

2006
02:43:27,250 --> 02:43:36,413
[SPEAKER_14]: And all I'm saying, and I think as my two predecessors who came here to speak, was what's taking place on the school committee does not represent the best interests of the city of Metro.

2007
02:43:37,122 --> 02:43:37,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2008
02:43:37,703 --> 02:43:38,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2009
02:43:48,732 --> 02:43:49,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record, please.

2010
02:43:49,813 --> 02:43:51,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Tony Pujol, I'm in Tanger Street.

2011
02:43:51,835 --> 02:43:52,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for listening to me.

2012
02:43:52,715 --> 02:43:56,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for being in this beautiful chambers tonight to hear us.

2013
02:43:57,860 --> 02:44:00,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to beat up a dead horse.

2014
02:44:00,262 --> 02:44:03,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Those ships have sailed, so to speak, the proverbial ships.

2015
02:44:05,930 --> 02:44:18,258
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason I'm coming up is because I want to know, to follow up with Mr. McGillip said, what can we do as a city council to help prevent this from occurring over and over and over?

2016
02:44:18,899 --> 02:44:29,246
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anything this council can do to enact an ordinance or some type of rule to prevent this from becoming a problem?

2017
02:44:31,201 --> 02:44:33,802
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not talking about the school committee, with all due respect to the president.

2018
02:44:33,842 --> 02:44:40,204
[SPEAKER_14]: But going forward on other buildings, there is no actual procedure in writing.

2019
02:44:40,684 --> 02:44:41,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Understood.

2020
02:44:41,685 --> 02:44:47,007
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe if the administration wants to adopt an actual procedure, that is up to them.

2021
02:44:47,027 --> 02:44:52,669
[SPEAKER_14]: But currently, there is nothing in writing that gives us a procedure on where to go.

2022
02:44:52,889 --> 02:44:53,689
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly, councilor.

2023
02:44:53,729 --> 02:44:58,591
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why I'm saying, can this council take a step in that direction to help present

2024
02:44:59,249 --> 02:45:04,873
[SPEAKER_14]: You could see that you could feel the anger in the air, just in this room with only so many people in here.

2025
02:45:05,473 --> 02:45:07,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you imagine what's going on in the rest of the city?

2026
02:45:07,374 --> 02:45:07,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course you have.

2027
02:45:08,075 --> 02:45:10,316
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I don't want to go on and on about this.

2028
02:45:10,376 --> 02:45:12,138
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to move forward, okay?

2029
02:45:12,598 --> 02:45:27,668
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to see this council, if possible, and I'm asking if you could get your heads together and come up with some type of rule or something just to show that, you know, hey, you can't just come in here and just all of a sudden just change some rules because you said so, because you felt like it.

2030
02:45:28,339 --> 02:45:33,001
[SPEAKER_14]: We need some input from citizens in this city, okay?

2031
02:45:33,562 --> 02:45:36,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Before large decisions are made.

2032
02:45:37,964 --> 02:45:41,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I don't expect you to check with every individual person in the city.

2033
02:45:41,866 --> 02:45:42,686
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not what I'm saying.

2034
02:45:43,226 --> 02:45:49,509
[SPEAKER_14]: But there should be better communication when large decisions are made with members of the city.

2035
02:45:49,689 --> 02:45:52,851
[SPEAKER_14]: And that goes, I'm not speaking for the school committee.

2036
02:45:52,871 --> 02:45:54,672
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm speaking for the city council and the school committee.

2037
02:45:55,172 --> 02:45:56,713
[SPEAKER_14]: I would just appreciate it if,

2038
02:45:58,217 --> 02:46:11,983
[SPEAKER_14]: If, you know, especially during the pandemic where some of us feel marginalized because I don't want to say any, any groups, you know, but there's some people who weren't really good with zoom and, uh, they weren't able to get on and voice their opinion.

2039
02:46:12,063 --> 02:46:16,525
[SPEAKER_14]: These people, they feel marginalized because this all happened and they feel like it happened behind their backs.

2040
02:46:17,405 --> 02:46:23,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, they may say it happened in June and they had all this time, but you know, I don't want to talk about the committee anymore.

2041
02:46:23,207 --> 02:46:27,289
[SPEAKER_14]: What I'm trying to say is please see if you could put your heads together and come up with something.

2042
02:46:28,098 --> 02:46:37,124
[SPEAKER_14]: to help not so much prevent this, but just that the community can have more participation and say in such large decisions.

2043
02:46:37,564 --> 02:46:38,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I would appreciate that.

2044
02:46:38,505 --> 02:46:40,006
[SPEAKER_14]: I respect you for listening to me tonight.

2045
02:46:40,086 --> 02:46:40,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2046
02:46:40,506 --> 02:46:40,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2047
02:46:50,293 --> 02:46:51,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

2048
02:46:53,135 --> 02:46:57,298
[SPEAKER_13]: Andrew Castagnetti, 101 Main Street, temporarily under doctor's care.

2049
02:46:58,820 --> 02:46:59,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, what is that address?

2050
02:47:00,641 --> 02:47:01,121
[SPEAKER_13]: 101 Main Street.

2051
02:47:01,641 --> 02:47:05,002
[SPEAKER_14]: If you can give me a proper address, it would be appreciated.

2052
02:47:06,143 --> 02:47:08,523
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm Christian and 101 Main.

2053
02:47:09,284 --> 02:47:09,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you miss me?

2054
02:47:10,504 --> 02:47:12,185
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't think so.

2055
02:47:12,625 --> 02:47:13,305
[SPEAKER_14]: We miss you.

2056
02:47:14,786 --> 02:47:15,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Not here.

2057
02:47:15,206 --> 02:47:17,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Not for a year.

2058
02:47:17,727 --> 02:47:19,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Not for a year.

2059
02:47:20,308 --> 02:47:27,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, it's nice to see most of you back in the City Hall chambers, taking care of the people's business.

2060
02:47:27,628 --> 02:47:30,030
[SPEAKER_13]: and not Ohio in your Corona basements.

2061
02:47:32,892 --> 02:47:34,253
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not write up anything.

2062
02:47:35,153 --> 02:47:36,874
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess this time it's very personal.

2063
02:47:37,475 --> 02:47:40,677
[SPEAKER_13]: Columbus, he's a big one.

2064
02:47:40,697 --> 02:47:45,861
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've been to the old country 12 times, even though I was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

2065
02:47:48,903 --> 02:47:54,627
[SPEAKER_14]: There's good and bad in every race, creed, religion, including cops and politicians.

2066
02:47:57,932 --> 02:48:05,134
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to commend Councilor, excuse me, David McKillop for having the courage to come forth and bring this issue before us.

2067
02:48:07,455 --> 02:48:22,820
[SPEAKER_14]: The only guy that had more courage, and he had more courage than everyone in this city, 57,000 people, was Christopher Columbus himself, who wanted to prove the world was around, and no one in Europe believed him, except for maybe some of the Knights Templars.

2068
02:48:25,421 --> 02:48:26,441
[SPEAKER_14]: And he would have proved it,

2069
02:48:26,917 --> 02:48:28,678
[SPEAKER_14]: if it wasn't brought by the two continents.

2070
02:48:33,379 --> 02:48:37,741
[SPEAKER_14]: The English were here first, after the Indians were here originally.

2071
02:48:39,381 --> 02:48:40,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand.

2072
02:48:41,202 --> 02:48:44,323
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the discrimination started from day one.

2073
02:48:45,023 --> 02:48:48,725
[SPEAKER_14]: As the Irish knew, they did not apply for a job.

2074
02:48:49,565 --> 02:48:51,986
[SPEAKER_14]: The Italians, they went through hell.

2075
02:48:53,006 --> 02:48:54,466
[SPEAKER_14]: They're still being discriminated against.

2076
02:48:54,687 --> 02:48:55,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Today, I have proof.

2077
02:48:56,451 --> 02:48:56,991
[SPEAKER_14]: personal.

2078
02:48:58,652 --> 02:49:07,296
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, the way it was, the name was taken away, it was not fair to the people, they had no, no forum in person.

2079
02:49:08,636 --> 02:49:11,037
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can go on and on and on.

2080
02:49:11,057 --> 02:49:21,181
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to mention Sacramento and Manhattan and New Orleans, Louisiana, they were pulled out of the jail and hung.

2081
02:49:23,322 --> 02:49:24,823
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'm just gonna cut it short.

2082
02:49:26,255 --> 02:49:27,275
[SPEAKER_14]: See, I'm disappointed.

2083
02:49:28,996 --> 02:49:50,501
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I'm gonna ask the city council, with all your legislative powers that you still claim very often, can you put this in the November ballot to save, keep, and reclaim Christopher Columbus' school name?

2084
02:49:50,741 --> 02:49:53,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that possible and doable?

2085
02:49:55,871 --> 02:49:59,293
[SPEAKER_14]: If somebody wants to, if a council wants to do that, that's.

2086
02:49:59,573 --> 02:50:04,435
[SPEAKER_14]: This doesn't fall, that doesn't fall within our purview to change names.

2087
02:50:06,616 --> 02:50:10,358
[SPEAKER_13]: So your legislative powers, you cannot put on the ballot.

2088
02:50:11,118 --> 02:50:12,839
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to, is that possible?

2089
02:50:13,819 --> 02:50:15,840
[SPEAKER_14]: If someone wants to make a motion, they can do that.

2090
02:50:16,100 --> 02:50:16,861
[SPEAKER_14]: It is possible.

2091
02:50:17,725 --> 02:50:19,667
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think anybody wants to even get into this situation.

2092
02:50:19,687 --> 02:50:23,009
[SPEAKER_14]: We've already said this from the start.

2093
02:50:23,290 --> 02:50:24,651
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a done deal.

2094
02:50:24,731 --> 02:50:26,012
[SPEAKER_14]: The school committee made the decision.

2095
02:50:26,212 --> 02:50:29,575
[SPEAKER_14]: The decision has been made, the scout says there's no power to overturn it.

2096
02:50:30,515 --> 02:50:34,418
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to go out and get some signatures and put it on the ballot, that's your option.

2097
02:50:34,459 --> 02:50:39,382
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm still working on my own occupied real estate tax exemption, chapter 59, section 5C, for 21 years.

2098
02:50:39,443 --> 02:50:40,403
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not fair.

2099
02:50:47,346 --> 02:50:55,212
[SPEAKER_14]: You insulted, not you, some peoples have insulted a lot of people in this city.

2100
02:50:56,753 --> 02:50:58,274
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's not gonna stop.

2101
02:50:58,854 --> 02:50:59,935
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. McKillop was right.

2102
02:51:00,896 --> 02:51:02,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Where it stops, nobody knows.

2103
02:51:03,418 --> 02:51:07,621
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't wanna go down that path with this canceled culture.

2104
02:51:07,981 --> 02:51:08,702
[SPEAKER_14]: It's horrendous.

2105
02:51:09,983 --> 02:51:15,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Matter of fact, this political correctness is turned by Christmas.

2106
02:51:18,399 --> 02:51:19,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Upside down.

2107
02:51:24,244 --> 02:51:24,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Andrew.

2108
02:51:27,006 --> 02:51:28,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

2109
02:51:29,948 --> 02:51:32,230
[SPEAKER_14]: We have one more person here, Councilor Marks.

2110
02:51:32,330 --> 02:51:33,851
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Miriam Brock, would you like to speak?

2111
02:51:34,892 --> 02:51:35,212
[SPEAKER_14]: On this?

2112
02:51:35,712 --> 02:51:36,073
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

2113
02:51:36,513 --> 02:51:37,374
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to speak on this.

2114
02:51:37,534 --> 02:51:38,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2115
02:51:39,095 --> 02:51:39,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

2116
02:51:40,776 --> 02:51:41,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2117
02:51:42,117 --> 02:51:45,580
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to thank the speakers for coming up tonight.

2118
02:51:46,141 --> 02:51:53,247
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this has always been an open forum for anyone that would like to come up and vent their concerns, Mr. President.

2119
02:51:53,687 --> 02:51:55,829
[SPEAKER_14]: And that should never, ever, ever change.

2120
02:51:56,490 --> 02:52:03,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Whether I agree or disagree, everyone has the right to come up here or on Zoom and express their thoughts and opinions.

2121
02:52:04,517 --> 02:52:07,959
[SPEAKER_14]: And we should never, never take that right away.

2122
02:52:08,520 --> 02:52:12,283
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, my opinion, I've been in government 26 years now.

2123
02:52:13,284 --> 02:52:14,445
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not, you know,

2124
02:52:14,918 --> 02:52:16,299
[SPEAKER_14]: afraid to say that, Mr. President.

2125
02:52:16,319 --> 02:52:18,079
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm proud of my years in service.

2126
02:52:18,580 --> 02:52:31,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the one major flaw with this process is the fact when the resolution was offered, it was offered to do something certain by a certain date.

2127
02:52:32,206 --> 02:52:38,048
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't inviting people to give input and say, what are your thoughts about this?

2128
02:52:38,509 --> 02:52:39,649
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you feel about this?

2129
02:52:39,929 --> 02:52:41,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take the name out of it.

2130
02:52:41,030 --> 02:52:42,470
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't matter who the name is.

2131
02:52:42,510 --> 02:52:43,891
[SPEAKER_14]: The names are interchangeable.

2132
02:52:44,656 --> 02:52:55,106
[SPEAKER_14]: The process was flawed from the start because it didn't ask for public input and give people the ability to get up there and say, these are my issues.

2133
02:52:55,747 --> 02:53:03,895
[SPEAKER_14]: And once that happens and you set that into motion, right away, you're going to disenfranchise a certain number of people on the other side, whichever side it may be.

2134
02:53:04,255 --> 02:53:05,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes you may be on the prevailing side.

2135
02:53:06,157 --> 02:53:07,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes you may be on the losing side.

2136
02:53:08,519 --> 02:53:09,300
[SPEAKER_14]: That doesn't matter.

2137
02:53:09,949 --> 02:53:18,386
[SPEAKER_14]: So right inherently what happened from the start is this process was flawed because right away it said, we're going to do this and by a certain date.

2138
02:53:19,308 --> 02:53:21,112
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a problem, Mr. President.

2139
02:53:22,045 --> 02:53:31,269
[SPEAKER_14]: If the resolution read, we're gonna discuss this and look for input, we're gonna discuss other options, other alternatives, it would have been a whole different scenario.

2140
02:53:31,769 --> 02:53:39,872
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've heard this from members of the community, even people that are pro change in the name and people that are against change in the name.

2141
02:53:40,212 --> 02:53:44,694
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had more people come up to me that are against change in the name saying it has nothing to do with Columbus.

2142
02:53:45,354 --> 02:53:48,496
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, nothing to do with Christopher Columbus.

2143
02:53:49,476 --> 02:53:51,517
[SPEAKER_14]: It has all to do with the process.

2144
02:53:52,745 --> 02:53:58,808
[SPEAKER_14]: And when there's a sense of frustration out there, as you're hearing, and it starts to build up, this is what you're gonna have.

2145
02:53:58,828 --> 02:54:00,669
[SPEAKER_14]: You're gonna have a divided community.

2146
02:54:01,129 --> 02:54:03,771
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's really unfortunate the way it rolled out.

2147
02:54:04,611 --> 02:54:13,195
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think anyone else behind this wheel can speak to the fact that I was the only member behind this wheel to actually vote on a school name.

2148
02:54:14,156 --> 02:54:15,036
[SPEAKER_14]: The only member.

2149
02:54:16,397 --> 02:54:17,097
[SPEAKER_14]: And guess what?

2150
02:54:18,438 --> 02:54:18,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Guess what?

2151
02:54:19,659 --> 02:54:22,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I voted against the name that was offered by the school committee.

2152
02:54:24,039 --> 02:54:28,041
[SPEAKER_14]: And I won't bring up the name because the school's named after that person now, and so be it.

2153
02:54:28,301 --> 02:54:29,861
[SPEAKER_14]: I was the only member to vote against it.

2154
02:54:30,322 --> 02:54:43,747
[SPEAKER_14]: And my reasoning was at the time, Mr. President, that the school committee changed their policy because you had to be deceased in this city under the school committee farmer policy in order to have a building named after it.

2155
02:54:44,827 --> 02:54:51,350
[SPEAKER_14]: And they took a vote to change the policy because they wanted to name it after someone that was very much alive

2156
02:54:53,274 --> 02:54:57,416
[SPEAKER_14]: So they changed the process in order to name it after who they wanted to.

2157
02:54:57,796 --> 02:54:59,417
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was a new member of the school committee.

2158
02:54:59,677 --> 02:55:01,658
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a difficult vote.

2159
02:55:01,918 --> 02:55:04,580
[SPEAKER_14]: It was against a very prominent person in this community.

2160
02:55:05,340 --> 02:55:08,062
[SPEAKER_14]: But I stood tall, Mr. President, because that's what I believed in.

2161
02:55:08,722 --> 02:55:11,063
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's what's happening now, Mr. President.

2162
02:55:11,523 --> 02:55:13,805
[SPEAKER_14]: The process is inherently flawed.

2163
02:55:15,365 --> 02:55:19,788
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're never gonna be able to come to the middle with a flawed process.

2164
02:55:20,988 --> 02:55:22,189
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would respectfully ask

2165
02:55:22,571 --> 02:55:24,632
[SPEAKER_14]: the school committee to reconsider.

2166
02:55:25,213 --> 02:55:27,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Take a look, revisit this.

2167
02:55:28,314 --> 02:55:32,397
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no rush to judgment, Mr. President.

2168
02:55:33,257 --> 02:55:36,079
[SPEAKER_14]: That school's been named that way for 100 years.

2169
02:55:36,659 --> 02:55:38,760
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no rush to judgment, Mr. President.

2170
02:55:39,081 --> 02:55:48,366
[SPEAKER_14]: It's more important to me that this community unite, especially during these difficult times, than to try to pass an agenda.

2171
02:55:49,417 --> 02:55:54,898
[SPEAKER_14]: That to me is far more important that we unite as a community, like we heard about 5G.

2172
02:55:57,199 --> 02:56:10,201
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would respectfully ask that the school committee, when they're in their deliberations, I know they set timeframes and so forth, but they respectfully look at what is being done to this community, ripping this community apart.

2173
02:56:11,262 --> 02:56:14,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of these wounds you're not gonna be able to heal, but guess what?

2174
02:56:15,823 --> 02:56:17,203
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not done right now.

2175
02:56:17,748 --> 02:56:21,730
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have time to say, let's take a step back, let's take a look at it.

2176
02:56:22,830 --> 02:56:23,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2177
02:56:24,130 --> 02:56:25,631
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2178
02:56:25,851 --> 02:56:26,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

2179
02:56:28,172 --> 02:56:28,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell.

2180
02:56:29,252 --> 02:56:29,973
[SPEAKER_09]: You may see her, right?

2181
02:56:30,013 --> 02:56:34,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Sharon's had her hand up for quite some time.

2182
02:56:35,375 --> 02:56:38,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Marianne's been waiting a while, and we have a couple of others after Marianne.

2183
02:56:38,756 --> 02:56:41,457
[SPEAKER_14]: So she's been waiting a while, so we'll let Marianne speak.

2184
02:56:42,817 --> 02:56:43,598
[SPEAKER_14]: Marianne Bruxton.

2185
02:56:46,539 --> 02:56:46,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Marianne?

2186
02:56:48,083 --> 02:56:51,164
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, sorry, I'm getting off the topic, so is that okay?

2187
02:56:51,184 --> 02:56:54,145
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay, you've been waiting long enough.

2188
02:56:54,586 --> 02:56:55,566
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool, thank you.

2189
02:56:56,446 --> 02:57:13,874
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I wanted to talk about, again, was the city of Medford housing proposal plan that, and again, I'm sorry that I thought it was in this meeting, but it's basically to address the comments on the resolution that, I'm sorry, I believe Councilor Marks offered last week talking about the two,

2190
02:57:16,631 --> 02:57:23,836
[SPEAKER_01]: lower income funding apartments that are coming up to not require the funding anymore.

2191
02:57:23,936 --> 02:57:35,823
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said at that time that if we do those and the four that are proposed, it would equal out to be 11%, which would push us over the 10% that's required by the state.

2192
02:57:36,423 --> 02:57:43,708
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, if you look at the report itself, on page 80 of the report, it states that even if the

2193
02:57:44,584 --> 02:57:49,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, there's three apartment buildings that are being proposed that are in the pipeline.

2194
02:57:49,547 --> 02:57:51,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's one more that's being proposed.

2195
02:57:52,088 --> 02:58:02,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if all four of those were to go through and be built, that would only bring us up to 10% of the, no, I'm sorry, 9.1%.

2196
02:58:03,053 --> 02:58:07,235
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't even bring us up to the full 10% that the state is required by the state.

2197
02:58:09,065 --> 02:58:14,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I love affordable housing, I think we should have more of it I think we should go well beyond 10% in the city of Medford.

2198
02:58:15,290 --> 02:58:27,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but my, my issue that I have is so the apartment building that's being proposed on the stick out is 378 units and 96 of them will be affordable, which is great.

2199
02:58:29,741 --> 02:58:43,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Gabb, it's again, it's an environmental justice area, which was named by the- I just want to make sure because we did have a close to a two hour meeting prior to this meeting.

2200
02:58:43,808 --> 02:58:45,428
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to set the record straight.

2201
02:58:45,788 --> 02:58:48,190
[SPEAKER_14]: The report we received from J.M.

2202
02:58:48,230 --> 02:58:52,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Golson regarding the draft housing production plan.

2203
02:58:52,632 --> 02:58:57,594
[SPEAKER_14]: If you look at it on page 82, it talks as Mary Ann just mentioned,

2204
02:58:58,064 --> 02:59:03,088
[SPEAKER_14]: about the chapter 40B projects that are currently in the pipeline in the community.

2205
02:59:03,609 --> 02:59:05,770
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is the report, this is not me stating it.

2206
02:59:06,251 --> 02:59:19,201
[SPEAKER_14]: It says if all four of these projects come to fruition, Method will have an additional 1,087 units eligible to be counted on the subsidized housing inventory, bringing the city's portion of the SHI units to 11.7%.

2207
02:59:21,203 --> 02:59:22,884
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to set the record straight.

2208
02:59:23,223 --> 02:59:37,768
[SPEAKER_14]: that according to this report, that's not me, and the consultant that was hired, if these four projects in the pipeline, the 40B projects come to fruition, we will be over the SHI rate that's required by the state.

2209
02:59:37,788 --> 02:59:38,668
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

2210
02:59:38,728 --> 02:59:42,509
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, because I just saw in that one part of the text there where it said it would only bring us up to 9.1.

2211
02:59:45,830 --> 02:59:55,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I also believe that because it's a 40B project, there's some sort of contingency that would say that all the units that are developed can be considered underneath the safe harbor, as opposed to just the affordable units.

2212
02:59:55,259 --> 02:59:58,041
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why it's 1,000, it's 1,000 something, 1,087.

2213
02:59:58,582 --> 02:59:58,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2214
02:59:59,443 --> 03:00:00,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and the point that, that's okay.

2215
03:00:01,124 --> 03:00:09,071
[SPEAKER_01]: The point that I would like to get to is that in the method of resiliency report, it said that a majority of people of Medford, the families that live here own two cars.

2216
03:00:09,652 --> 03:00:10,453
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're putting 378 units

2217
03:00:12,392 --> 03:00:14,492
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely people will have a car.

2218
03:00:14,552 --> 03:00:15,633
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they may have two cars.

2219
03:00:16,133 --> 03:00:18,353
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it is right in front of an MBTA bus stop.

2220
03:00:19,013 --> 03:00:21,374
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe they will use the bus to commute back and forth.

2221
03:00:21,734 --> 03:00:27,075
[SPEAKER_01]: But the issue that I have is that prior to COVID, the 95 was extended into Arlington.

2222
03:00:27,155 --> 03:00:28,696
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more people on the bus now.

2223
03:00:29,516 --> 03:00:39,058
[SPEAKER_01]: And knowing that the 326 and 325 were canceled and the 95 was recommended to be one of the buses that people that usually take that route use,

2224
03:00:39,878 --> 03:00:40,978
[SPEAKER_01]: that's even more people.

2225
03:00:41,258 --> 03:00:54,000
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know last week that Zach Bares asked to the amend when you were talking about bus route 70 being continued again, that he added into 326 to be considered, but you have to look at, okay, so there's 378 families in there.

2226
03:00:54,040 --> 03:01:07,003
[SPEAKER_01]: However many, if it's a four people family, how many more people are going to be on this one bus that's already extremely crowded and you're putting a multifamily unit in an already environmental justice area for people?

2227
03:01:07,043 --> 03:01:08,503
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my concern is that,

2228
03:01:08,973 --> 03:01:12,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we also going to make sure that, all right, what is the MBTA going to do about this?

2229
03:01:13,174 --> 03:01:19,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to have an overcrowded 95, that it's going to take you an hour, maybe, if you're lucky, to catch the bus in the morning to go someplace?

2230
03:01:20,375 --> 03:01:22,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're going to have this many people.

2231
03:01:22,516 --> 03:01:24,776
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I'm not against affordable housing.

2232
03:01:24,896 --> 03:01:26,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that we should be going beyond 10%.

2233
03:01:27,257 --> 03:01:28,157
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be going on beyond 11%.

2234
03:01:29,457 --> 03:01:34,058
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like it's always, okay, why are we putting them in areas that are mostly specific

2235
03:01:34,795 --> 03:01:38,656
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental justice areas, like how many, how is that going to affect the community?

2236
03:01:39,136 --> 03:01:44,178
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have this many people coming in and living in the community, what is that going to do to our resources?

2237
03:01:44,298 --> 03:01:50,500
[SPEAKER_01]: If they all have a car, how is that going to affect the smog and the soot that's in the air for people?

2238
03:01:51,280 --> 03:02:00,002
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like, are we thinking about this or what is going to be done to make up for this, to compensate for that, for the people that live here now?

2239
03:02:00,183 --> 03:02:01,703
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not trying to sound nativist,

2240
03:02:02,185 --> 03:02:05,227
[SPEAKER_01]: saying like, well, we don't want this house is there, we don't want more people here.

2241
03:02:06,348 --> 03:02:22,179
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are we going to do to make sure that people that are already taking this bus in a low income area that may not have a car themselves will not be pushed out of it because we're having the people from Arlington also on the 95, people from 326 already on the 95 and then 378 units added to that bus route.

2242
03:02:22,239 --> 03:02:22,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Marion.

2243
03:02:22,680 --> 03:02:23,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. President.

2244
03:02:32,422 --> 03:02:33,979
[SPEAKER_14]: Just if I could, just to clarify.

2245
03:02:35,069 --> 03:02:40,410
[SPEAKER_14]: The city of Method is not dictating where these 40B projects are gonna go.

2246
03:02:40,850 --> 03:02:51,912
[SPEAKER_14]: What happens is because we don't meet the 10% threshold which is required by state statute, they're able to come in into 40B, which allows them to circumvent state law.

2247
03:02:52,352 --> 03:02:53,572
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what's happening right now.

2248
03:02:53,632 --> 03:02:56,773
[SPEAKER_14]: So they can pop up and go anywhere they want in the community.

2249
03:02:57,093 --> 03:03:00,573
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not picking particular sections for them to go in.

2250
03:03:00,953 --> 03:03:03,694
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what is allowed under state statute 40B.

2251
03:03:04,909 --> 03:03:05,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2252
03:03:05,970 --> 03:03:06,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2253
03:03:07,811 --> 03:03:09,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Marianne, are you finished?

2254
03:03:11,593 --> 03:03:12,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Marianne?

2255
03:03:14,796 --> 03:03:15,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Marianne.

2256
03:03:15,816 --> 03:03:16,177
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

2257
03:03:16,197 --> 03:03:16,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

2258
03:03:16,577 --> 03:03:17,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having trouble.

2259
03:03:17,998 --> 03:03:31,507
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, my question is, so what are you going to do to make sure that people that take this bus every day will not be having to wait an hour or be able to be crammed on a bus that's already crowded in the morning?

2260
03:03:31,927 --> 03:03:34,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you work with the MTA to make sure that more is there?

2261
03:03:38,375 --> 03:03:40,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, a couple of things.

2262
03:03:40,336 --> 03:03:45,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one, the MBTA determines the level of service and the level of service for our bus community is based upon ridership.

2263
03:03:45,939 --> 03:03:50,862
[SPEAKER_14]: So if there's ridership, then the bus services should increase in a perfect world.

2264
03:03:51,242 --> 03:03:57,506
[SPEAKER_14]: The MBTA gives us a very large assessment and that assessment based upon the services that we deliver to this community, number one.

2265
03:03:57,846 --> 03:04:02,149
[SPEAKER_14]: Number two, when it comes down to where the development comes from, like Councilor Mack said,

2266
03:04:03,430 --> 03:04:11,894
[SPEAKER_14]: property owner petitions the city for a comprehensive permit under Chapter 40 B. They petition the city for a comprehensive permit under Chapter 40 B, it bypasses local zoning.

2267
03:04:11,914 --> 03:04:18,837
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, so if the concern is how many people are gonna be riding the bus, ridership drives the level of service at the MBTA.

2268
03:04:19,017 --> 03:04:22,899
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that the city clerk, having been the former chief of staff, they can probably confirm that.

2269
03:04:22,919 --> 03:04:25,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2270
03:04:25,160 --> 03:04:27,921
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, Marianne, are you?

2271
03:04:28,001 --> 03:04:29,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you.

2272
03:04:29,962 --> 03:04:30,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Marianne.

2273
03:04:31,623 --> 03:04:32,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Chairman Diaso,

2274
03:04:32,918 --> 03:04:33,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record.

2275
03:04:37,259 --> 03:04:37,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Sharon?

2276
03:04:39,420 --> 03:04:40,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record.

2277
03:04:45,081 --> 03:04:45,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have you, Sharon?

2278
03:04:56,604 --> 03:04:56,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Sharon?

2279
03:04:56,845 --> 03:04:59,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you there?

2280
03:04:59,065 --> 03:05:00,926
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we'll move on.

2281
03:05:02,608 --> 03:05:03,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Kelly Cattaro.

2282
03:05:04,410 --> 03:05:05,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address of the record, please.

2283
03:05:08,153 --> 03:05:10,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, will you unmute Kelly Cattaro, please?

2284
03:05:11,650 --> 03:05:14,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Kelly Catalo, 46 Otis Street in Medford.

2285
03:05:15,634 --> 03:05:26,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand the process is the way the process is right now, but there seems to be people are missing the connection between the naming of the building and the value of the building.

2286
03:05:26,826 --> 03:05:34,834
[SPEAKER_08]: So protecting the asset definitely is in the purview of the city council, regardless how this goes this point forward.

2287
03:05:35,394 --> 03:05:42,498
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the council should come together and should have a meeting in regards to renaming of any city building in the future.

2288
03:05:42,518 --> 03:05:53,162
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people that have been in New York City can have fond feelings for Rockefeller Center, and how many people would not be happy if it was named Trump Center?

2289
03:05:53,563 --> 03:05:55,324
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people would be happy with that?

2290
03:05:55,404 --> 03:06:02,267
[SPEAKER_08]: The naming of a building absolutely goes to value, and I'd like to see the city council come together in the future

2291
03:06:02,847 --> 03:06:12,211
[SPEAKER_08]: to perhaps come up with a resolution so that we don't all of a sudden see the renaming of every building in the city based upon the feeling of poor people.

2292
03:06:12,472 --> 03:06:12,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2293
03:06:14,072 --> 03:06:14,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2294
03:06:16,513 --> 03:06:19,535
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we have any other, I think we're done with any more public participation.

2295
03:06:19,555 --> 03:06:20,515
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see any more hands up.

2296
03:06:22,216 --> 03:06:25,478
[SPEAKER_14]: We have one paper under suspension by Councilor Marks.

2297
03:06:33,174 --> 03:06:34,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to take the paper under suspension.

2298
03:06:38,078 --> 03:06:39,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, you want to take that off the table also?

2299
03:06:40,700 --> 03:06:40,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2300
03:06:41,721 --> 03:06:53,550
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion by Councilor Knight to take paper, hold on, to take paper 21307 off the table.

2301
03:06:54,451 --> 03:06:55,752
[SPEAKER_14]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2302
03:06:55,772 --> 03:06:56,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2303
03:06:58,755 --> 03:06:59,415
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Bears.

2304
03:06:59,876 --> 03:07:00,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2305
03:07:01,277 --> 03:07:01,997
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

2306
03:07:02,558 --> 03:07:02,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2307
03:07:03,186 --> 03:07:03,887
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight?

2308
03:07:04,087 --> 03:07:04,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2309
03:07:04,627 --> 03:07:05,208
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks?

2310
03:07:05,508 --> 03:07:05,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2311
03:07:06,108 --> 03:07:06,749
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Morell?

2312
03:07:07,149 --> 03:07:07,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2313
03:07:08,230 --> 03:07:08,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2314
03:07:09,291 --> 03:07:09,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2315
03:07:09,631 --> 03:07:10,332
[SPEAKER_14]: President Kiriboy.

2316
03:07:10,352 --> 03:07:11,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative.

2317
03:07:11,252 --> 03:07:12,093
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

2318
03:07:13,134 --> 03:07:18,478
[SPEAKER_14]: 21307 offered by Councilor Knight, Councilor Scarpelli, and Councilor Falco.

2319
03:07:19,079 --> 03:07:25,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that Medford City Council send its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Alan McDougal on his recent passing.

2320
03:07:26,404 --> 03:07:27,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Knight.

2321
03:07:28,997 --> 03:07:34,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much for allowing me a moment to remember my friend Al McDougal.

2322
03:07:34,718 --> 03:07:41,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I first met Al as a freshman in high school trying out for the football team, and Al was our freshman football coach.

2323
03:07:42,080 --> 03:07:47,221
[SPEAKER_14]: And I went on to play lacrosse that spring, and Al was our freshman lacrosse coach as well.

2324
03:07:47,822 --> 03:07:53,503
[SPEAKER_14]: And over those years, since my freshman year in high school, I've been able to develop a great relationship with Al.

2325
03:07:54,096 --> 03:07:54,896
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a dear friend.

2326
03:07:54,936 --> 03:08:01,078
[SPEAKER_02]: He was very committed to American Legion Post 45 and the fundraising efforts and the volunteer and charity work that they do up there.

2327
03:08:01,558 --> 03:08:04,298
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a Verizon employee that worked at Verizon for a number of years.

2328
03:08:04,638 --> 03:08:08,879
[SPEAKER_02]: But most importantly, Mr. President, he was one of those guys that would sweat blue and white.

2329
03:08:09,059 --> 03:08:11,220
[SPEAKER_14]: He was a Metro Mustang through and through.

2330
03:08:11,260 --> 03:08:17,461
[SPEAKER_14]: He was captain of the last Metro High School football team that won the Greater Boston League Championship.

2331
03:08:17,981 --> 03:08:22,062
[SPEAKER_14]: And just recently, he passed away while on the line of duty working for Verizon.

2332
03:08:22,780 --> 03:08:30,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mr. President, I'm asking that my council colleagues join in and expressing their deep and sincere condolences to the family of McDougal, of Alan McDougal.

2333
03:08:30,485 --> 03:08:40,010
[SPEAKER_02]: He was someone that certainly made a difference here in this community, certainly someone that touched the lives of many youth in this community, and certainly someone that has a legacy that deserves to be remembered.

2334
03:08:40,550 --> 03:08:45,053
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I rest my case and ask my council colleagues to support the resolve.

2335
03:08:46,714 --> 03:08:47,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President.

2336
03:08:47,715 --> 03:08:48,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2337
03:08:49,596 --> 03:08:50,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilman.

2338
03:08:50,836 --> 03:08:51,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Council President.

2339
03:08:52,464 --> 03:08:56,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it's a sad day when we have to talk about the passing of a true legend.

2340
03:08:56,707 --> 03:08:59,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Alan McDougal meant a lot to a lot of people.

2341
03:08:59,569 --> 03:09:10,677
[SPEAKER_14]: And you could see that by the outpouring of, of condolences to toward his friends and his ceremony last week and, and just celebrating his, uh, his life and just knowing him.

2342
03:09:11,038 --> 03:09:15,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, yeah, Alan was a true, true definition of blue and white flowing through the veins.

2343
03:09:16,261 --> 03:09:19,744
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Mr. Kelly, uh, when he brought that to Medford,

2344
03:09:20,450 --> 03:09:26,913
[SPEAKER_14]: There was one person that stood up and followed that, and then pushed that along to everybody else to make sure everybody knew what that meant.

2345
03:09:26,933 --> 03:09:29,795
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just not a statement of words, but it's a way of life.

2346
03:09:30,275 --> 03:09:38,279
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's sad because I think that if people loved Medford the way Alan loved Medford, a lot of the issues we have today wouldn't be issues.

2347
03:09:38,859 --> 03:09:49,104
[SPEAKER_14]: And when you have that much passion, that much love, and that much respect for the blue and white, for the city of Medford, for what it stood and what it stands for,

2348
03:09:50,421 --> 03:10:02,044
[SPEAKER_14]: Alan was that true leader to do that, whether it be on the football field or whether it's coaching with him when we were coaching, you know, he was coaching football, I was coaching soccer.

2349
03:10:04,005 --> 03:10:09,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Alan was this big opposing figure that would scare most people.

2350
03:10:10,287 --> 03:10:18,329
[SPEAKER_14]: And I still remember Alan in high school, you know, typical, you know, walked around as a typical jock

2351
03:10:19,210 --> 03:10:21,812
[SPEAKER_14]: angry, you know, you get so nervous as a young kid.

2352
03:10:22,933 --> 03:10:28,977
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'll never forget Alan's demeanor and how he would just walk up to you make you feel welcome.

2353
03:10:29,657 --> 03:10:39,284
[SPEAKER_14]: And it took away so many of those stereotypical thoughts of what high school was all about, you know, or the big captain of the football team and how he was supposed to respond to younger kids.

2354
03:10:40,165 --> 03:10:43,587
[SPEAKER_14]: But Alan didn't do anything that we were told it was going to happen to our kids.

2355
03:10:44,108 --> 03:10:48,771
[SPEAKER_14]: He was a kid that brought people in and gave them a lesson and how to love Medford.

2356
03:10:49,232 --> 03:10:50,072
[SPEAKER_14]: and be a Mustang.

2357
03:10:50,692 --> 03:10:57,214
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've said this way too often too lately, is who's gonna pick up that baton.

2358
03:10:57,975 --> 03:11:03,396
[SPEAKER_14]: When people like Alan McDougall leave us, who is gonna be the next person to pick up that baton?

2359
03:11:03,956 --> 03:11:16,120
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope as we move forward, I know that his friends, you know, looking at scholarships and so people can actually benefit

2360
03:11:16,673 --> 03:11:22,515
[SPEAKER_14]: from Alan's death, but also spread his word and who he was, so we can really keep his name alive.

2361
03:11:22,775 --> 03:11:30,359
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'll tell you, there was one sad day when I got that phone call to say Alan Tugel just died.

2362
03:11:30,879 --> 03:11:41,143
[SPEAKER_14]: So rest in peace, my friend, and I'll make sure that in my life, in my circles, that his name and his legacy will never be forgotten.

2363
03:11:41,583 --> 03:11:43,324
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for bringing this forward constantly.

2364
03:11:43,724 --> 03:11:44,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2365
03:11:44,820 --> 03:11:45,521
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Falco.

2366
03:11:45,781 --> 03:11:46,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2367
03:11:46,661 --> 03:11:52,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli for the awards.

2368
03:11:52,926 --> 03:11:55,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I first met Al when I was a sophomore in high school, 1985.

2369
03:11:55,648 --> 03:11:59,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I was on that team that won the GBL championship.

2370
03:11:59,830 --> 03:12:04,574
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember when I first met Al, it was a pretty intimidating situation.

2371
03:12:04,614 --> 03:12:07,616
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a captain, but he was a leader.

2372
03:12:07,836 --> 03:12:09,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And he could lead both on and off the field.

2373
03:12:10,778 --> 03:12:11,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice guy.

2374
03:12:13,629 --> 03:12:16,912
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're on the team, you treat it like family.

2375
03:12:17,712 --> 03:12:26,079
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was a great guy, a fierce competitor, great football player, offense, defense, he could do it all.

2376
03:12:26,540 --> 03:12:27,160
[SPEAKER_03]: He kicked too.

2377
03:12:27,701 --> 03:12:29,142
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a kicker at one point.

2378
03:12:29,342 --> 03:12:33,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was just a great competitor.

2379
03:12:33,165 --> 03:12:41,612
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like counselor Scarpelli said, I remember those days, Coach Bud Kelly, another great person.

2380
03:12:42,648 --> 03:12:44,009
[SPEAKER_03]: He would always talk repeatedly.

2381
03:12:44,409 --> 03:12:50,452
[SPEAKER_03]: He got blue and white running through the veins, and no one had more blue and white running through their veins than Al McDougal.

2382
03:12:50,713 --> 03:12:55,255
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he was just a great person and he won't be missed.

2383
03:12:55,415 --> 03:13:00,478
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Captain Al, my thoughts and prayers are with you.

2384
03:13:00,498 --> 03:13:01,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Palacio.

2385
03:13:01,438 --> 03:13:01,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Marks.

2386
03:13:03,099 --> 03:13:10,383
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I couldn't say enough with my colleagues already said, I appreciate Council Vice President Knight putting us on.

2387
03:13:11,207 --> 03:13:13,268
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, the old saying, don't judge a book by its cover.

2388
03:13:13,568 --> 03:13:16,109
[SPEAKER_14]: It's exactly what Councilor Scarpelli mentioned.

2389
03:13:16,569 --> 03:13:20,531
[SPEAKER_14]: When you first looked at him, you say, wow, this guy would, you know, pretty intimidating.

2390
03:13:20,931 --> 03:13:31,775
[SPEAKER_14]: And the way he came across, he was big in stature and so forth, but you couldn't meet a nicer, kinder, gentler person that really would go over and above to make someone else feel welcomed.

2391
03:13:32,395 --> 03:13:34,296
[SPEAKER_14]: And he just had that personality about him.

2392
03:13:35,276 --> 03:13:36,777
[SPEAKER_14]: And he will sorely be missed.

2393
03:13:37,128 --> 03:13:46,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, his love was to his teammates, his love was to sports in this community and student athletes.

2394
03:13:47,152 --> 03:13:52,094
[SPEAKER_14]: And it really showed through the work he did for many years, volunteering and so forth.

2395
03:13:52,634 --> 03:13:55,995
[SPEAKER_14]: So my heart goes out to his family and friends.

2396
03:13:56,915 --> 03:13:58,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2397
03:13:58,196 --> 03:14:01,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Personally, he was a gentleman.

2398
03:14:01,817 --> 03:14:06,919
[SPEAKER_14]: Believe it or not, I probably saw the guy four days a week.

2399
03:14:07,970 --> 03:14:12,514
[SPEAKER_14]: talk to him for at least four days a week.

2400
03:14:12,695 --> 03:14:17,719
[SPEAKER_14]: He's a good person, a good family, and he's going to be sorely missed in our community.

2401
03:14:20,021 --> 03:14:20,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion?

2402
03:14:23,184 --> 03:14:25,927
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the motion by Councilor Nathan, the meeting will be dedicated in his honor.

2403
03:14:27,208 --> 03:14:28,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

2404
03:14:28,889 --> 03:14:31,332
[SPEAKER_14]: We have one more on too, Mr. President, if you want to do it at the same time.

2405
03:14:45,104 --> 03:14:47,245

[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Marks.

2423
03:15:16,541 --> 03:15:17,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2424
03:15:17,942 --> 03:15:25,647
[SPEAKER_14]: For anyone that knew Joe and his lovely wife, Carolyn, they were the epitome of a couple in this community.

2425
03:15:26,048 --> 03:15:27,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Married 62 years.

2426
03:15:28,009 --> 03:15:30,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Whenever you saw Joe, you saw Carolyn, and vice versa.

2427
03:15:31,315 --> 03:15:38,156
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, many people knew Joe as Umbrella Joe, which sounds like a strange nickname, but he loved hanging around the beach.

2428
03:15:38,757 --> 03:15:42,657
[SPEAKER_14]: And he was at the beach so often, they used to call him Umbrella Joe.

2429
03:15:43,538 --> 03:15:44,918
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess this could be worse names.

2430
03:15:45,338 --> 03:15:50,979
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, he served in the United States Army and fought in the Korean War.

2431
03:15:51,719 --> 03:16:00,241
[SPEAKER_14]: The last of the, you know, the old generation there that you said they went to war, they raised a family, they worked hard, they had family values.

2432
03:16:00,862 --> 03:16:08,004
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's sad, Mr. President, seeing these residents that were losing one at a time.

2433
03:16:08,404 --> 03:16:09,204
[SPEAKER_14]: It really is sad.

2434
03:16:09,905 --> 03:16:16,046
[SPEAKER_14]: He loves spending time with his family and his grandchildren, and he will be sorry, Mr. President.

2435
03:16:17,047 --> 03:16:17,407
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2436
03:16:17,727 --> 03:16:18,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2437
03:16:20,708 --> 03:16:21,948
[SPEAKER_14]: Will you rise for a moment of silence, please?

[SPEAKER_14]: So it's exactly what they have put through for traffic calming initiatives that will be implemented until the study is done and then move forward with the full time traffic signal at that location.

2501
03:18:39,096 --> 03:18:41,317
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know that people have been talking about that.

2502
03:18:41,357 --> 03:18:47,138
[SPEAKER_14]: They still haven't seen anything, but it's good to hear that Wednesday night you'll see some action and hopefully that leaves for

2503
03:18:47,948 --> 03:18:54,072
[SPEAKER_14]: a safe corridor for the time being until it's permanently completed.

2504
03:18:54,792 --> 03:19:10,681
[SPEAKER_14]: The second thing I wanted to share is I know that a couple of months ago we were here with a food truck permit and there was some questions and issues and concerns and there was some anger and some things were said.

2505
03:19:10,801 --> 03:19:15,904
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to share something with everybody that

2506
03:19:17,728 --> 03:19:23,530
[SPEAKER_14]: When that happened, before the meeting was over, I got a text from a few restaurants in the city.

2507
03:19:24,150 --> 03:19:36,953
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know Vivian Sue, the president of the Andrews Middle School, she works diligently for the kids to make sure that they have funding for any sort of activities for the kids, even through this pandemic year.

2508
03:19:37,753 --> 03:19:44,535
[SPEAKER_14]: A fundraiser, thanks to Marie Carroll and Carroll's Restaurant, they're providing a fundraiser, which is a true fundraiser.

2509
03:19:45,069 --> 03:19:58,620
[SPEAKER_14]: He's doing for food in-house, anybody that comes with the flyer from the Andrews, 30% of the proceeds will go back to the school and the takeout 40% of the proceeds will go back to the school.

2510
03:19:59,061 --> 03:20:08,088
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think this is the true indication of what we're trying to go that evening with that our restaurants, our brick and mortar buildings were hurting.

2511
03:20:08,735 --> 03:20:23,165
[SPEAKER_14]: And we knew that if there could be an organization that would help, you know, we, I think there were three restaurants that were mentioned, and Carroll's, Razzo's, I think Salvatore's, but these restaurants stood up and Marty's Carroll's stepped up again.

2512
03:20:23,185 --> 03:20:33,332
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that, I don't know, I'm watching what I'm eating, so I can get a salad, but I'll definitely pie that.

2513
03:20:33,393 --> 03:20:33,973
[SPEAKER_14]: I just watch.

2514
03:20:36,014 --> 03:20:37,756
[SPEAKER_14]: But I just wanted to share those two,

2515
03:20:39,002 --> 03:20:40,203
[SPEAKER_14]: to issues with the community.

2516
03:20:40,483 --> 03:20:41,683
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you, everybody.

2517
03:20:41,703 --> 03:20:43,644
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Councilor Knight wants me to shut up.

2518
03:20:43,704 --> 03:20:45,065
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you.
