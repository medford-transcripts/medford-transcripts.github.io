1
00:00:03,051 --> 00:00:04,454
[SPEAKER_05]: City Council Committee the whole March 6 2024.

2
00:00:04,514 --> 00:00:05,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:10,503 --> 00:00:12,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Collins, present.

4
00:00:12,784 --> 00:00:14,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lazzaro, present.

5
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:16,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lemingng, present.

6
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:17,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli, present.

7
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:19,386
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Sands, present.

8
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:20,426
[SPEAKER_07]: President Bears.

9
00:00:20,626 --> 00:00:23,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Presidents and presidents, your absent the meeting is called to order.

10
00:00:23,787 --> 00:00:30,569
[SPEAKER_05]: This meeting will take place at 6pm in the City Council Chamber, second floor, Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Essa Drive, Medford MA and via Zoom.

11
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:34,750
[SPEAKER_05]: To submit written comments, please email ahertabse at medford-ma.gov.

12
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:41,659
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a meeting on 24-045, which is the resolution regarding the schedule of the annual budget process.

13
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:51,173
[SPEAKER_05]: As we discussed at our last regular meeting, by March 1st, city councilors submit individual budget recommendations for consideration.

14
00:00:53,274 --> 00:00:56,675
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to submit a collective budget recommendation to the mayor.

15
00:00:57,255 --> 00:01:04,878
[SPEAKER_05]: We're then going to hold meetings with department heads and staff from April 15th to May 15th before the mayor submits her budget proposal on May 31st.

16
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:10,220
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll have another opportunity to talk to any department that we want to talk to after May 31st.

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,560
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if.

18
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:19,053
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to invite someone back if we've had all our questions answered and their budget hasn't substantively changed since our preliminary meeting in April to May.

19
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:21,274
[SPEAKER_05]: No reason to have them down again.

20
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:34,361
[SPEAKER_05]: But if there are departments that we want to invite back and have further questions or we want to understand the impact of what the mayor's budget proposal is on those departments, then we'll be able to do that.

21
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,763
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor also can, if she wants a department to come back, she can.

22
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:45,860
[SPEAKER_05]: also send them to us to give another presentation.

23
00:01:46,682 --> 00:01:48,124
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the basic process.

24
00:01:48,324 --> 00:01:51,830
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank Councilors for submitting budget recommendations.

25
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:55,500
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a bunch of them in here.

26
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to go through, give everybody a chance to kind of talk about their budget recommendations.

27
00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,345
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have them in order, so I'll share a screen in a minute.

28
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:20,636
[SPEAKER_05]: But starting with Councilor Lazzaro, main ones were to protect cuts or prevent cuts at the Board of Health, anything that serves vulnerable residents, schools, and affordable housing, and protecting residents dealing with housing insecurity and housing issues.

29
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:22,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro.

30
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:24,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

31
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:28,606
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my priorities are fairly self-explanatory.

32
00:02:28,686 --> 00:02:46,797
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to me that we make sure that baseline we're not losing any of our departments that serve the basic needs of our residents that are especially vulnerable to the rising cost of housing and the rising cost of living in

33
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:57,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford, but also in Massachusetts and in the United States, there are rising levels of homelessness across the country.

34
00:02:58,451 --> 00:03:16,398
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love to see, in fact, increases to the budget and in our services that we offer to people dealing with housing insecurity, any kind of eviction protections, protections for people with low incomes.

35
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:32,886
[SPEAKER_02]: and protections for people dealing with mental health and addiction issues, but short of increasing the budget, it's my highest priority that we not see any cuts to those departments, anything that would relate to that.

36
00:03:34,167 --> 00:03:34,747
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition,

37
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:39,233
[SPEAKER_02]: The school departments, I think I mentioned schools.

38
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have it in front of me.

39
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't bring my computer with me today.

40
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:49,420
[SPEAKER_02]: But the school budget needs to see an increase and at least needs to not decrease.

41
00:03:50,781 --> 00:04:05,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we're all most, I think most of us are in agreement about that, that the underfunding of Medford public schools is a pertinent issue and is something that is also one of my priorities.

42
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:06,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

43
00:04:07,752 --> 00:04:10,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go to Councilor Collins.

44
00:04:10,774 --> 00:04:23,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins submitted primary priority in Medford's first post ARPA and ESSER operating budget, ARPA and ESSER being the federal funding that the city has received for the pandemic and pandemic recovery.

45
00:04:23,661 --> 00:04:33,006
[SPEAKER_05]: We must maintain capacity within city departments, maintain capacity for key city functions and priorities, including long-term multi-year projects like road and sidewalk improvements, housing

46
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:39,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Climate resiliency capital product planning and maintaining constituent service and schools for all residents.

47
00:04:40,374 --> 00:04:51,989
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the 6 primary priorities are 1 prioritize meeting the school departments, budget requests to prioritize the library departments, budget requests and maintaining level service an hour of operations.

48
00:04:52,850 --> 00:05:14,871
[SPEAKER_05]: hours of operation, three maintain grant funded personnel in the health department, access to outreach and prevention and office of planning and development and sustainability, increased budgeted amount for city solicitor salary to maintain competitiveness with neighboring municipalities, increased budgeted amount for assistance city solicitor salary to maintain competitiveness with neighboring municipalities and Councilor Collins does have numbers on those.

49
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:21,255
[SPEAKER_05]: plus $49,871 for the city solicitor and plus $37,178 for the assistant.

50
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:30,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And also escalate elections manager position to elections director and increase budgeted amount for salary by $28,000 to attract competitive qualified candidates.

51
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:44,205
[SPEAKER_05]: There are also secondary priorities, one of which was implementing the Massachusetts Paid Family Medical Leave program for all city employees, which would increase city competitiveness with private employers and with other cities.

52
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:53,643
[SPEAKER_05]: and along with the compensation and classification study, help attract and retain competitive candidates in city positions to achieve fuller staffing and increase capacity across departments.

53
00:05:54,503 --> 00:06:01,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's also a study or consultant review of finance department software upgrade options and development implementation scenarios.

54
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:12,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Apart from expanding the personnel budget, what software and financial tools would increase capacity and effectiveness of the finance department budgetary and what would the budgetary impact of those upgrades be?

55
00:06:13,988 --> 00:06:14,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's it.

56
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:20,910
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will go to Vice President Collins to talk a little bit more about her recommendations.

57
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears.

58
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:27,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, what I put in my memo speaks to my recommendations.

59
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:29,532
[SPEAKER_00]: My priority is for this budget cycle.

60
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:40,535
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to be a budget year where I think that we are having the bandwidth to pilot a lot of new programs or start a lot of new positions.

61
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:49,336
[SPEAKER_00]: My focus is on maintaining level service for constituents and for students and workers in school systems.

62
00:06:50,196 --> 00:07:07,780
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why my number one and number two priorities are meeting the school department budget request and meeting the library department budget request, making sure that we maintain level service and hours of operation at the library in particular, because that has been something that has been called into question in some past budget cycles.

63
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:22,326
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to call out specifically grant-funded personnel in the Health Department, Office of Outreach and Prevention, and the Planning Department because there are a lot of grant-funded positions in those departments specifically, but we know that all those positions are critical.

64
00:07:23,686 --> 00:07:36,952
[SPEAKER_00]: In our community, they serve really important functions and the needs for those roles are not going away just because pandemic-era funding and grant funding is going away, so we need to make sure that we are maintaining level service by

65
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:51,586
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling those positions either onto other sources of grant funding or ideally making sure that those positions can be maintained within our operations, our operating budget this year and in future years.

66
00:07:54,093 --> 00:08:00,977
[SPEAKER_00]: The next few key priorities for this year are ones that we've talked about around this time of year in the past.

67
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,782
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to get a city solicitor and an assistant city solicitor online as quickly as we can.

68
00:08:09,963 --> 00:08:17,728
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my belief that we need to raise the amount budgeted for salary for those positions so that we can be attracting competitive candidates.

69
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:35,540
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that this is a at this moment in time a tough position to hire for in this area in, in general, and I think that these positions are so important that we should prioritize escalating the amount of salary budgeted for these positions, so that

70
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:39,082
[SPEAKER_00]: we are competitive with some of our neighboring municipalities.

71
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:44,144
[SPEAKER_00]: I put some recommended dollar figures on here.

72
00:08:44,204 --> 00:08:53,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are based off of my research into what our neighboring communities of Malden and Somerville primarily are paying for these positions.

73
00:08:53,987 --> 00:09:00,249
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in Malden, the budgeted salary for their city solicitor is around, it's a little over 117,000.

74
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,170
[SPEAKER_00]: In Somerville, it's 189.

75
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:15,357
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that the figure I suggested to increase the city solicitor salary by less than $50,000 was based on the discrepancy with Malden.

76
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:18,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?

77
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:20,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.

78
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:22,962
[SPEAKER_00]: That was based off the discrepancy with the city of Somerville.

79
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:32,187
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is a big jump for one position, but I think we've all felt for the past few years how significant it is to not have a city solicitor in-house, and I think that that would be a

80
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:39,821
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we can be pound wise by investing more money into these unfilled city positions.

81
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:50,547
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same for the assistant city solicitor and in escalating the elections manager to a direct deliver position again I think that these are things that you know we see what happens when we don't invest in making sure that

82
00:09:52,307 --> 00:09:55,209
[SPEAKER_00]: these positions are first and foremost filled.

83
00:09:55,329 --> 00:09:59,672
[SPEAKER_00]: And second, you know, we really owe the people of Medford, the best possible person in all of these roles.

84
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:05,636
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put the secondary priorities under areas of study slash secondary priorities.

85
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:11,080
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that these are things we're not going to be able to bring online early in fiscal 25.

86
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:21,947
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that charting a course towards implementing a paid family and medical leave program for all city employees, apart from being the right thing to do and what all of our city employees deserve will help us

87
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,289
[SPEAKER_00]: fill key staffing roles.

88
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:36,680
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that a review of what needs to happen to bring our finance department software into the 2020s is something that we would see the benefit from.

89
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we achieve that, we need to figure out if that's something that can happen in three, five, or 10 years.

90
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:45,728
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that every department would feel the positive effects of that.

91
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:47,710
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that

92
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:58,053
[SPEAKER_00]: while not being things that I think are realistic to prioritize for fiscal 25, these are things that I hope that the administration is saving some capacity for studying this year.

93
00:10:58,454 --> 00:10:58,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

94
00:10:58,774 --> 00:11:00,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Allen.

95
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,956
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to go to Councilor Lemingng, then Councilor Scarpelli.

96
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:14,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lemingng, I have here from you money for linkage, nexus and transportation demand studies, increased salary for library pages for the non-union part-time staff.

97
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:20,295
[SPEAKER_05]: more staffing in the elections office and permanent salary for community social worker Councilor let me.

98
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:21,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you.

99
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:24,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I submitted a brief list of budget recommendations.

100
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:32,630
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to make it a little bit more of a focused a couple of focused items because I.

101
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:55,846
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I didn't want it to be too redundant to some of the issues and very important issues that my colleagues brought up concerning the staff concerning the budget for the schools, for instance, but these, but I just like to make sure with these relatively modest requests that we have money set aside for three studies that I believe will be.

102
00:11:57,807 --> 00:12:21,216
[SPEAKER_09]: for the long term financial health of the city, a linkage study, which should be coming into, which should be brought up at the council meeting next week in order to update the linkage fees in the city, a nexus study, which will determine how much to charge the developers to put into

103
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:40,934
[SPEAKER_09]: affordable housing and a transportation demand management study, which would also be carried out by the planning office in order to implement at the staff level the transportation demand management program, which is currently in the planning and permitting committee.

104
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:49,996
[SPEAKER_09]: The rest is just really repeating what was said before about the need for more and permanent election staff.

105
00:12:52,196 --> 00:13:02,802
[SPEAKER_09]: which I think the last, the previous election and the fact that we've had a lot of loss in that department has really shown the importance of.

106
00:13:02,822 --> 00:13:15,989
[SPEAKER_09]: A permanent salary for one community social worker who has been on a sort of a revolving set of funds for a while now, it's a very important position.

107
00:13:16,969 --> 00:13:25,712
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had a conversation about having increased salary for the part-time library workers.

108
00:13:25,752 --> 00:13:33,834
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a position that I haven't seen a whole lot of advocacy for or mention of just previously in other city conversations.

109
00:13:33,874 --> 00:13:41,397
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thought it would be useful to represent them in some of these budgetary priorities.

110
00:13:41,677 --> 00:13:42,317
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

111
00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:44,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Lemingng.

112
00:13:44,857 --> 00:14:03,921
[SPEAKER_05]: From Councilor Scarpelli, I have City Solicitor, Assistant City Solicitor, DPW Cement and Hot Top Crew and Equipment, Administrative Assistant for the Recreation Department, full-time or part-time to start, might be a good option to share with elections, Program Coordinator, Recreation Department, focused on afterschool care, and staffing and education for elections.

113
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:04,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

114
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,543
[SPEAKER_03]: really tried to focus on for our many years and going through this process is understanding.

115
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:28,585
[SPEAKER_03]: First things first is looking at what I would request and what it really meant to our budget.

116
00:14:30,618 --> 00:14:32,799
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that there's a tone to it.

117
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:56,687
[SPEAKER_03]: City Solicitor, Assistant City Solicitor, I was going to talk about, I'm glad Councilor Collins brought up the fact, Vice President Collins brought up the fact that the reason that we're not filling that position is, you know, the dialogue out there is when you're offering a position that important, it should be given that respect when it comes to pay.

118
00:14:57,548 --> 00:14:57,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And,

119
00:14:59,386 --> 00:15:17,589
[SPEAKER_03]: when you keep it at that price, and like I've told you in the past, everybody here, that I've talked to city solicitors that I've worked with in the past, and this is, you know, their observation is that you only can apply for a job and be a city solicitor if the mayor truly wants a city solicitor.

120
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:25,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she's very comfortable, KP Law, I think she controls the dialogue, and as KP Law says, they don't work for us.

121
00:15:26,611 --> 00:15:28,171
[SPEAKER_03]: A city solicitor now works for us.

122
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:32,632
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I think that's so important, I'll say it over and over again.

123
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:42,274
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a huge disservice for the residents of the BJ's neighborhood because we answered questions without having legal representation.

124
00:15:43,154 --> 00:15:48,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And it cost us by putting in a gas station that we could say now they're doing it that we don't need there.

125
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:58,337
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for a huge company that has a lot of money that has done nothing to prosper relationship with the neighborhood.

126
00:15:59,157 --> 00:15:59,477
[SPEAKER_03]: we've done.

127
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:01,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Even even after they've come in and talk to us.

128
00:16:02,219 --> 00:16:02,979
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a mess.

129
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,860
[SPEAKER_03]: They still have not fulfilled what they've wanted.

130
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,821
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have done so.

131
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:17,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Having the funded positions to what it deserves to be, and I'm glad Council Collins shared those numbers because I had the similar numbers from, um.

132
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:19,606
[SPEAKER_03]: That city

133
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:41,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could see that, and I think that that's a huge cost savings, both with not bringing KP law for hourly rate and something that they really don't assist us with, and the fact that having someone that heads off huge issues, like I mentioned earlier.

134
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:44,237
[SPEAKER_03]: The DPW cement and hot top crew.

135
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:47,678
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something, I think it's now, it's sort of,

136
00:16:49,699 --> 00:17:12,192
[SPEAKER_03]: comedic now when I bring it up because I've been doing this since we started I when I first when it was my first year as a Councilor was gung ho about this and I got a report and I did a I did a study and I came to I brought I brought the paperwork into the to the administration and it was a crew of three with their salaries and their benefits and their one time cost for the truck.

137
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:14,874
[SPEAKER_03]: And it came out to maybe like $250,000.

138
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was voted down, it wasn't even obtained.

139
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:30,389
[SPEAKER_03]: But since then, every year, we are asked to pull a bond for cement sidewalks for 2.5 million to 500,000 per million dollars.

140
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:37,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can guarantee you we're going to get that again this year, the mayor will come to us and ask us for a bond for sidewalk repaving.

141
00:17:37,816 --> 00:17:37,936
[SPEAKER_03]: And

142
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:41,837
[SPEAKER_03]: where you can have your own crew come in and do that.

143
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:57,246
[SPEAKER_03]: And when times are slow, which they wouldn't be because we have so many issues, you can also use that crew to backfill, whether it's a spring to help the fields crew get that facility ready, whether it's highway, if we need something with highway.

144
00:17:58,047 --> 00:18:05,372
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably one of the most underfunded, under positioned

145
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:19,738
[SPEAKER_03]: departments in our city, both DPW, and as you all know, with the fire department being down 25 firefighters, you're looking at under funding and undermining our most vital positions, and that's hurting us.

146
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,181
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I bring that up.

147
00:18:23,381 --> 00:18:32,947
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other, the administration for recreation department, so I would get a few phone calls, because I don't know, some of you might know,

148
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:40,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I chaired and spearheaded the full time recreation department here in Medford a few years back.

149
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:52,433
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mayor Burke gave me the opportunity to chair it and really be the voice and share my professional opinion and we really watch it grow.

150
00:18:52,954 --> 00:18:55,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Kevin Bailey and his team, they do an amazing job.

151
00:18:56,946 --> 00:19:00,027
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we're at the point where there's growth, we have to keep moving forward now.

152
00:19:01,127 --> 00:19:03,628
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're starting to get stagnant and we're starting to waste money.

153
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:05,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll give you an example.

154
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:24,195
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have a director that's making, you know, maybe 90s, and he's spending 15 hours, 20 hours a week, answering phones, making phone calls, replying to emails, because they don't have a even a part time administrative assistant.

155
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:30,990
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the things that you see that are hurting us, and they're cost effective, and no by no means.

156
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:41,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you look at the situation where we when we talk about elections they say well funding the elections department is difficult because it's only really during election season we really need those people so.

157
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:56,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the administration if they can is to be a little creative and looking at a position where you have someone that's working in the recreation office, maybe 20 hours a week, or maybe 30 hours and 10 hours in the slow times in elections.

158
00:19:56,508 --> 00:20:02,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that flips during election time, they work 30 hours in elections and work 10 hours at recreation.

159
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that would be more cost effective when you're talking about

160
00:20:06,511 --> 00:20:14,861
[SPEAKER_03]: your director or your assistant director answering phone calls that that you really should have someone that's, you know, there all the time.

161
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:18,506
[SPEAKER_03]: The other pieces of people saying that we don't have someone that's answering the phone.

162
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:20,729
[SPEAKER_03]: So parents would call even during the program.

163
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:24,094
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as a recreation department, you want somebody at that phone.

164
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:30,776
[SPEAKER_03]: You might have an issue with, a parent might've forgot that, they forgot to tell us their child is allergic to bananas.

165
00:20:31,676 --> 00:20:37,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you don't have a person you can talk to, and you can't get ahold of that person that's in the field, it's a scary time.

166
00:20:38,179 --> 00:20:42,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it's dramatic, but these are the things that we think of when we work with children.

167
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,721
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I look at that position, seeing how important that is.

168
00:20:48,402 --> 00:20:55,949
[SPEAKER_03]: The other position is looking at increasing program, another program coordinator that focuses on after school care.

169
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:06,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you as, as my profession, we see the benefits financially and for our community, when you can offer

170
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:20,539
[SPEAKER_03]: a robust program through your recreation department, where parents aren't afraid to spend money to make sure their kids are in a highly developed program like the recreation respected program like recreation.

171
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:29,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And that also supports the issues we're having in the school department, that you've all heard it, you've all gotten phone calls that there's no after school care.

172
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:44,656
[SPEAKER_03]: one school's full, so there's a waiting list, they'll never get in, and then as they try to get on the next season, they can't do it, so it's just a revolving issue that, for the most part, who it really affects is the most needy in our community.

173
00:21:45,136 --> 00:21:55,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the more affluent members of our community that understand on April 1st, registration's gonna open, they're gonna be there right on their computer, boom, boom, boom, they're gonna sign up with their credit cards, and what happens,

174
00:21:56,605 --> 00:22:03,629
[SPEAKER_03]: You have families that don't have that access, maybe not to a computer, not to even have a credit card.

175
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,251
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes it difficult to make sure there's equity there.

176
00:22:07,291 --> 00:22:14,335
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that having that position would really help when it comes to the overflow and looking at what we're doing.

177
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:20,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that we work closely with the YMCA with their afterschool care, and they take a lot of the voucher kids in our city.

178
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:22,242
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's still a huge need.

179
00:22:23,002 --> 00:22:41,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And you love the fact that our parents that have a voice are being heard and the Brooks and the Roberts and the McGlynn and they're being heard and they're figuring out ways like being creative and starting bringing in Mr. Karate and paying Mr. Karate $150 for an after school program.

180
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,598
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds great for the parent that has the means.

181
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:54,042
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we talk about kids that don't that when they're locked out of the YMCA program, because the numbers, these are things that I feel that are important in our budget.

182
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:58,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Next is staffing and education for the elections.

183
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:02,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hearing some pretty disturbing things in the streets.

184
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:07,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only from this, you know, last election, still things are lingering.

185
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:12,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot has to do with probably the greatest people in our community.

186
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:14,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the people that are working the polls.

187
00:23:15,763 --> 00:23:25,967
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're talking about, I know most of them, and they're the sweetest people in the world, but unfortunately, I don't think we spend enough money and time in making sure they're trained properly.

188
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that does what?

189
00:23:28,248 --> 00:23:34,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Because perception is reality, that then puts them in a bad position because they weren't taught the right way.

190
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:42,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And a resident that is educated when it comes to this, they blow things totally through the roof and who gets affected and then who walks away.

191
00:23:43,494 --> 00:23:45,475
[SPEAKER_03]: are those people that come in and do that work for us.

192
00:23:45,535 --> 00:23:52,038
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know a little winded, but I wanted to make sure that there was a dialogue and there was a reasoning for my choices.

193
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:58,921
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're also, you know, I know that Councilor Villes, we all want the schools at least level funded.

194
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:06,425
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I heard today that the teachers, union representatives reached out to me today and they were told that

195
00:24:07,065 --> 00:24:12,329
[SPEAKER_03]: The school system is at a spending freeze right now, and they're still trying to make up.

196
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:23,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that Councilor Bears heard something different, which is better news, but from what I heard last time, it was still $2.5 million that the mayor actually replied and said that's true.

197
00:24:23,157 --> 00:24:30,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is scary because a lot of it's coming down to the sustainability.

198
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:36,227
[SPEAKER_03]: When we purchased or we put any money from ARPA or ESSER into any of our programs,

199
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:50,186
[SPEAKER_03]: The reasoning in other communities having that person that oversaw the ARPA money, the first thing that when we met with them as a professional, when you meet with that director, they say, okay, what is the sustainability after that money is done?

200
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:51,407
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the key.

201
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:55,229
[SPEAKER_03]: If we couldn't show sustainability, we couldn't move forward.

202
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:57,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford just used it as a stopgap.

203
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:00,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're gonna be in dire straits.

204
00:25:00,311 --> 00:25:05,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's why having this meeting is great, but we all should realize I'm trying to,

205
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:17,685
[SPEAKER_03]: educate everybody I talk to, you know, and you, my fellow colleagues are just starting off, you're going to see, you're going to get phone calls, emails, people going to stop you in the street, and they're going to blame you.

206
00:25:18,644 --> 00:25:22,427
[SPEAKER_03]: and people don't understand the budget process.

207
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:27,992
[SPEAKER_03]: We can ask what we're doing right now, but when it comes down to the budget, all we can do is cut, we can't add.

208
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:38,782
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just trying to educate people with that, just so they know, because it is going to be, I hope I'm wrong, I pray to God I'm wrong, but it doesn't look good.

209
00:25:39,182 --> 00:25:40,764
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you very much, Mr. President.

210
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:44,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And I owe you 66 minutes for talking, so.

211
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,710
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you're good.

212
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:47,331
[SPEAKER_05]: You're all good.

213
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:53,096
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Tseng, and I have boiled down his letter.

214
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:57,860
[SPEAKER_05]: If I miss anything, you let me know.

215
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:06,566
[SPEAKER_05]: But we had the discussion of the Youth and Gender Equity Commissions and looking at 20,000 for the Youth Commission, 9,000 for the Gender Equity Commission.

216
00:26:07,287 --> 00:26:26,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Maintaining investments in our public schools and community liaisons program, translation services, and the economic development planner, health equity and outreach coordinator positions, ensuring that the salary is competitive for hiring a new prevention outreach manager, increasing line item spending for road signage and markings, increasing staffing in our elections office.

217
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,192
[SPEAKER_05]: the city's financial software and increasing financial assessing staff.

218
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:40,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Ensuring HR has the capacity to keep their work and complete their work in a more timely manner, improving child care access and raising the salaries of vacant positions to meet regional standards.

219
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sanchez.

220
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:41,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

221
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:45,799
[SPEAKER_04]: And a special thank you to all my colleagues for bearing with me.

222
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:55,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in memo writing mode last week, writing legal memos, so I figured it would be easier for me just to continue with the memo writing.

223
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially, thank you.

224
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.

225
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:02,871
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad my teacher gave me a name.

226
00:27:07,017 --> 00:27:10,099
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially my idea is well down to three big categories.

227
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:18,844
[SPEAKER_04]: One is small dollar increases, investments to help our city improve its public services.

228
00:27:19,324 --> 00:27:26,448
[SPEAKER_04]: The second category is preserving spending, important spending projects that we have right now, which I think many of my colleagues have already alluded to.

229
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:30,431
[SPEAKER_04]: The last bucket is long-term plans.

230
00:27:31,071 --> 00:27:49,887
[SPEAKER_04]: So essentially spending items I think for me personally as a Councilor, I don't need to see in this budget because I know the constraints on this budget are real, but I really would like the administration to commit to putting plans forward, at least the next few months to show us how we might get to a place where we can fund those important priorities.

231
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:51,929
[SPEAKER_04]: So going one by one.

232
00:27:52,710 --> 00:28:04,246
[SPEAKER_04]: The first bucket, I really is much shorter so I've sat down with some of our city staff and the prevention outreach department, recreation department as well.

233
00:28:04,587 --> 00:28:06,709
[SPEAKER_04]: We've basically been working on the youth.

234
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,472
[SPEAKER_04]: commission ordinance that I know Councilor Scarpelli is also big into.

235
00:28:11,872 --> 00:28:19,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've made a lot of progress, but we've also identified that we will need a real budget if we want the project to succeed.

236
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:35,304
[SPEAKER_04]: And so sitting down, doing the calculations, thinking about the number of members that we need to be paying for that commission and also the event costs, the cost for a secretary or lead organizer for the commission, it boils down to about $20,000.

237
00:28:36,605 --> 00:28:42,092
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the number is somewhat adjustable, but that's about the number we need.

238
00:28:43,293 --> 00:28:46,156
[SPEAKER_04]: And this includes $800 stipends for members.

239
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:51,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the stipend, because it includes youth, it should be $800 or less, because when you go over $800, there are special reports that

240
00:28:57,489 --> 00:28:58,790
[SPEAKER_04]: folks under 18 have to file.

241
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:11,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a similar logic is behind the Gender Equity Commission, which I think because there will likely be less programming and less secretarial kind of work needed, clerical work needed, $9,000 is an

242
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,919
[SPEAKER_04]: appropriate amount for that.

243
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:31,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I've also talked to member city staff in the planning and DW department, something that we talked about earlier this year when we were working through the governing agenda when I was sitting with them and going through the governing agenda was

244
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:40,474
[SPEAKER_04]: to help our city meet our priorities when it comes to safe streets and bicycle lanes, repaving streets.

245
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:49,582
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a series of policies that dictate what types of signage and markings we need before we can repave a street.

246
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:53,985
[SPEAKER_04]: That's oftentimes a constraint to us actually getting the repaving done.

247
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:56,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they've mentioned that

248
00:29:57,148 --> 00:30:05,410
[SPEAKER_04]: increasing the line item spending for road signages slash road markings can be really helpful in getting us to repave streets faster and in a safer manner.

249
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:17,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Very similarly in kind of the raising spending category, increasing staffing for our elections department I think is something that's already been said a few times.

250
00:30:18,893 --> 00:30:23,314
[SPEAKER_04]: We have noted I think it's really noteworthy the

251
00:30:24,814 --> 00:30:36,042
[SPEAKER_04]: the change in the elections department going from more FDs to fewer FDs and how that really constrains what our city government can do and the quality of the service that we can give our residents.

252
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:52,554
[SPEAKER_04]: And given that this year we have a very contentious presidential election, given the political atmosphere, both municipally and nationally, increasing the capacity of our elections office I think is very paramount.

253
00:30:53,775 --> 00:31:00,622
[SPEAKER_04]: In the second bucket, essentially, we have the items where I think we need to fight hard on preserving spending.

254
00:31:01,363 --> 00:31:08,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Councilor Scarpelli really made a very important point in saying that the victims of

255
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:14,455
[SPEAKER_04]: government, cutting government spending are oftentimes and usually the less advantaged in our city.

256
00:31:15,396 --> 00:31:23,981
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily going to affect every single resident, but it will affect a large number of residents who can't afford to replace those services with their own budget.

257
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:45,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why maintaining our spending in our public schools, in our library, maintaining the community liaisons program, which is grant funded, maintaining our health equity and outreach positions are really important priorities for us, for me at least, and from what I hear for the rest of the council as well.

258
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:49,477
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are essentially

259
00:31:52,022 --> 00:31:58,643
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially roles that we need to make sure don't get lost and don't become victim to cuts in government spending.

260
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:04,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, there's also the economic development plan I've also put in this bucket.

261
00:32:04,985 --> 00:32:14,993
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a really, really, really important position that's been helping Medford open up a lot of new businesses that folks in the community have been really excited for.

262
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:27,123
[SPEAKER_04]: We've just hired a new one, and I think it's very much a priority of mine to make sure that we can keep developing our local economy, and hopefully that will help us improve our revenues over a longer term as well.

263
00:32:27,783 --> 00:32:28,684
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to do that.

264
00:32:28,704 --> 00:32:30,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the last bucket about long term plans.

265
00:32:30,985 --> 00:32:42,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, um, for me, the real focus is one of the types of investments our city can make early on that will reap us rewards and benefits and especially more revenue in the future.

266
00:32:42,853 --> 00:32:44,254
[SPEAKER_04]: And so updating our city's

267
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:04,905
[SPEAKER_04]: assist us in the reforms that we want to make is really important to me, and I think it's something that the City Council should be pushing for more.

268
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:14,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Ensuring that our HR department has the capacity they need to complete their work, I think is something that will make working in Medford more of a draw.

269
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,372
[SPEAKER_04]: for city staff as well.

270
00:33:18,952 --> 00:33:33,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And well, some of the dissatisfaction that we hear from improving childcare access is something that tons of residents write me about throughout the term, no matter what time of the year it is.

271
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:41,487
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Councilor Collins' vein, raising the salaries of vacant positions to meet regional pay standards is, I think, really important.

272
00:33:41,807 --> 00:33:49,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And it sounds like there's appetite for us to push hard for this cycle, which I would be happy in joining as well.

273
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:56,432
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard a lot about how difficult it is to fill some of our positions because there's a shortage in the labor force.

274
00:33:56,713 --> 00:34:00,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, because of market demands, we just have to be willing to pay for what we want.

275
00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:12,797
[SPEAKER_04]: and I agree that a city solicitor is really, really important to helping our city council get as much work done as possible, and to help the city save costs from outsourcing.

276
00:34:13,357 --> 00:34:25,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would be very happy to support any action to bring those salaries up to where our neighboring municipalities are at to draw candidates.

277
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

278
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:36,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go to Councilor Cahan, and then if you have any, and then I can read mine, and then we can talk about it.

279
00:34:36,954 --> 00:34:37,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much.

280
00:34:37,394 --> 00:34:49,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize to my fellow Councilors for not submitting mine in a timely manner, but I want to, first of all, just state my agreements with points that other folks have brought up.

281
00:34:51,044 --> 00:34:58,390
[SPEAKER_01]: One is level funding for Medford public schools, including those positions that have been paid for with funds that may be ending or may have ended.

282
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:05,335
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with Councilor Scarpelli's request for a DPW hardtop group.

283
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure that we maintain our funding for community liaisons.

284
00:35:13,116 --> 00:35:17,740
[SPEAKER_01]: The elections department needs to be fully funded as it was in the past with an elections director.

285
00:35:18,961 --> 00:35:24,347
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely agree with everyone that the city solicitor and assistant city solicitor salaries need to be increased.

286
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:27,830
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to find those people and fill those positions.

287
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:32,935
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two that I think have not been mentioned.

288
00:35:33,796 --> 00:35:36,819
[SPEAKER_01]: One is our tree planting budget should equal an amount

289
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:47,439
[SPEAKER_01]: that can fund the amount needed to plant the number of trees that Medford loses per year, whatever best estimate that is we have for like a five year average.

290
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:56,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see a, this is not exactly a budget request but it's like information that I think needs to come along with the budget.

291
00:35:56,623 --> 00:35:57,004
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that

292
00:35:58,843 --> 00:36:12,866
[SPEAKER_01]: We have requested from the administration an explanation of what our five-year plan is for fixing our roads and sidewalks and how that matches with the pavement report, pavement management study, and the sidewalk study that were done.

293
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:21,788
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that we need to see a five-year plan so that we can understand how the upcoming budget fits into this plan.

294
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:23,248
[SPEAKER_01]: At a minimum,

295
00:36:24,088 --> 00:36:38,227
[SPEAKER_01]: If that plan is not ready in time, the budget for roads and sidewalks should come with an explanation of what is going to be accomplished with the funds just for this year as compared to the plans from the pavement management study and the sidewalk study.

296
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:40,991
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are mine.

297
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:41,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

298
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

299
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, I do have one question.

300
00:36:46,171 --> 00:36:46,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

301
00:36:47,351 --> 00:37:05,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there, for example, if there were creative ideas that came from the community about how we can support our local small businesses, is there some sort of a fund where small amounts of money like $2,000, $4,000, those kinds of things can come out of?

302
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:08,596
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not aware of one.

303
00:37:08,616 --> 00:37:10,056
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there have been some.

304
00:37:10,677 --> 00:37:12,297
[SPEAKER_05]: There may have been one through ARPA.

305
00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:21,923
[SPEAKER_05]: There were some micro grants and micro projects that went out, but I don't think there's anything in the general fund budget to my knowledge.

306
00:37:22,004 --> 00:37:31,891
[SPEAKER_01]: I would request there be a small slush fund for, you know, creative events and other ideas that can help our local small businesses.

307
00:37:32,111 --> 00:37:35,534
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking like 10k maybe for an entire year, just very small.

308
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,003
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're talking small, but you could do some interesting events and things with 10K.

309
00:37:48,023 --> 00:37:48,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

310
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:56,809
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so mine, I had just five bullet points.

311
00:37:57,029 --> 00:37:59,430
[SPEAKER_05]: One was level service funding for our public schools.

312
00:38:00,171 --> 00:38:04,374
[SPEAKER_05]: The second was to do our best to retain all ARPA-funded staff positions on the city side.

313
00:38:06,255 --> 00:38:07,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with Matt.

314
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:11,898
[SPEAKER_05]: The part-time non-union staff at the library haven't seen

315
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:16,961
[SPEAKER_05]: a raise in six, seven, or eight years, and so we're really losing.

316
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:38,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Those positions are really hard to fill, and I think that's one that slipped through the cracks because they don't qualify under when we do the non-union raises for full-time, which we did last year, and they're not under the union contract for the library, so they managed to get outside of both of those processes where everyone else has been brought up, so I think that group should be brought up, and I think that's a

317
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,918
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, that's more of a technical error than it is anything else.

318
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:46,278
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really hope that we can address that in the budget.

319
00:38:48,499 --> 00:38:56,160
[SPEAKER_05]: With Councilor Caraviello not here, I will sound the horn to increase funding for code enforcement in the building department.

320
00:38:57,021 --> 00:39:00,461
[SPEAKER_05]: That is what he would bring every year to these meetings.

321
00:39:00,521 --> 00:39:07,003
[SPEAKER_05]: We need more folks over there for a number of reasons, but the job's getting even bigger.

322
00:39:07,923 --> 00:39:08,963
[SPEAKER_05]: Short-term rentals,

323
00:39:09,963 --> 00:39:16,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe a rental registry, maybe, you know, the leaf blower, but we know that we need more code enforcement.

324
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:19,950
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a quality of life issue for people across the city.

325
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have so many civil code violations.

326
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:30,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And very few resources devoted to actually enforcing the civil code and making sure that the city is.

327
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:39,215
[SPEAKER_05]: just staying clean and safe and relatively as beautiful as it can.

328
00:39:39,915 --> 00:39:44,136
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is really important to everyone's daily quality of life.

329
00:39:44,196 --> 00:39:54,820
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that a lot of the complaints that we hear from folks outside of the big ticket items of fixing the roads and building a new school and building a fire station and funding staff positions really come down to

330
00:39:55,939 --> 00:40:00,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is there trash on the curb and on the sidewalks?

331
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:10,605
[SPEAKER_05]: And why are private landowners able to leave their front lawns just looking at a situation which is against our city ordinances and things like that?

332
00:40:10,766 --> 00:40:13,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So really just want to sound that alarm.

333
00:40:14,407 --> 00:40:22,611
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the last one, it aligns with what everyone else has said, but around the city financial software, at least putting the seed money in

334
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:27,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, you could talk about it's been talked a couple ways in here.

335
00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:35,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng, uh, his recommendation around update our city's financial software, increased financial assessing staff.

336
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:39,444
[SPEAKER_05]: We had ensuring human resources have capacity to complete their work.

337
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:40,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Um.

338
00:40:41,385 --> 00:40:43,767
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, and I think this kind of has gone on.

339
00:40:44,688 --> 00:40:45,769
[SPEAKER_05]: Unspoken.

340
00:40:46,761 --> 00:41:00,285
[SPEAKER_05]: and maybe this isn't the space to speak it, but I'm going to say it anyway, this entire thing around the fire department has started from a place of our financial systems being in not a good place, right?

341
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:11,028
[SPEAKER_05]: And retro pay taking way too long to get out the door after we, you know, we had a contract approved, we rushed through, we skipped the three readings unanimously on a contract, and then it hits the

342
00:41:11,795 --> 00:41:13,956
[SPEAKER_05]: it's the financial system that can't calculate the payroll.

343
00:41:13,996 --> 00:41:17,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And here we are in a really bad spot.

344
00:41:17,598 --> 00:41:26,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all of us agree, regardless of what maybe our individual positions are on individual specific issues, that if we just had better financial software, we may not be in at all.

345
00:41:27,603 --> 00:41:40,050
[SPEAKER_05]: So I really think that that is, you know, having had conversations with different departments and seeing how payroll works in the clerk's office and seeing how it works in other parts of the city,

346
00:41:41,741 --> 00:41:53,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, maybe it's a $2 or $3 million investment to really bring up our financial stuff to where it needs to be or get the staff in there or make sure that the training's there, whatever the issues are.

347
00:41:56,482 --> 00:42:04,169
[SPEAKER_05]: between the staff time and the paperwork and all of that that's going into it, we're spending hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars anyway.

348
00:42:05,069 --> 00:42:13,617
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're taking, in the police department, there's two and a half FT working on finance and paperwork outside of our finance department, right?

349
00:42:13,717 --> 00:42:15,679
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a lot of money.

350
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:17,881
[SPEAKER_05]: And that multiplies across all of our departments.

351
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:23,485
[SPEAKER_05]: When you have department heads spending hours a week on paperwork, that really could be automated.

352
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:46,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we would find, and I haven't even gotten into the fact of all the reporting that we've been looking for for two years or wanting to know the financial situation of different, you know, I could go on and on and on about all of the things that spring from this central problem of not having the financial software in a place that we get timely reporting and that staff doesn't have to do onerous amounts of work.

353
00:42:47,709 --> 00:42:49,690
[SPEAKER_05]: to just do basic financial functions.

354
00:42:49,790 --> 00:43:05,296
[SPEAKER_05]: So to me, it may be the most boring of everything we've talked about, but I think it's actually at the center of a lot of the problems that we see in the city, or at the very least, understanding what those problems are and beginning to find solutions to them.

355
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:08,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope we move in that direction.

356
00:43:08,798 --> 00:43:12,419
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are my recommendations as well.

357
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to open it up to general discussion, and then I have been trying to

358
00:43:17,495 --> 00:43:25,263
[SPEAKER_05]: lump these into different categories, but I need another minute to do that, so I'll go to Vice President Collins.

359
00:43:26,885 --> 00:43:34,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Bears, and I thank all of my fellow councillors for coming into the meeting with their recommendations.

360
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:38,698
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really exciting that we're starting this conversation in March for the first time in

361
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:47,849
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time that I've been on the council, which is not that long, but I think that this conversation, this process is beginning earlier than it usually does.

362
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:58,672
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate the administration's cooperation so far with trying to make the overall budgeting process more communicative and less rushed.

363
00:43:58,732 --> 00:43:59,932
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is a great start.

364
00:44:01,353 --> 00:44:07,977
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to hear that there's cohesion among a lot of us on a lot of the shared priorities, and I think that's not surprising because we hear all the same issues.

365
00:44:08,577 --> 00:44:25,349
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when I think back over the past couple years of budget discussions and what the common threads that emerge are, you know, we're the funnel into which sort of the main problems and aspirations and grievances of the city

366
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:27,170
[SPEAKER_00]: comes into.

367
00:44:27,691 --> 00:44:32,593
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the conversation that we've been having about the law department for a couple of years is an example of this.

368
00:44:32,673 --> 00:44:39,916
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing our capacity reduced within these chambers because we lack in-house legal support.

369
00:44:40,517 --> 00:44:42,618
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it taking a lot of time on ordinances.

370
00:44:42,698 --> 00:44:46,620
[SPEAKER_00]: We see legal issues coming up, like the BJ's lawsuit, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned.

371
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the work of this council, very productive in the past, has been to say, what's the common denominator here?

372
00:44:51,982 --> 00:44:55,764
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the investment that we're not making that we need to make that could be the fulcrum for all this other change?

373
00:44:56,244 --> 00:45:10,262
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had a staffed in-house legal department, I think we would be seeing the difference in our workflow, in the quality of our workflow, and how quickly we're able to get things done, and then there would be all the things that we are not seeing.

374
00:45:10,883 --> 00:45:12,004
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the decisions that

375
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:23,956
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to make, or we have to put off, or we have to request from an outside legal perspective, and they're not super accountable to their timelines, to our timelines, because they don't work for us.

376
00:45:24,016 --> 00:45:29,119
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the negatives that we don't see because of a targeted investment, in addition to all the positives that we do start to see.

377
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:34,643
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's still that common denominator that we're still looking for that targeted investment there.

378
00:45:34,663 --> 00:45:42,267
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the other one that this conversation, um, I would say over the past six months is also revealing is needed investments to the finance department.

379
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:44,108
[SPEAKER_00]: I think president bears put it very well.

380
00:45:44,888 --> 00:45:50,131
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these positives that we would start to see if we brought our financial software and staffing up to year 2024.

381
00:45:50,711 --> 00:45:58,756
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's all these negatives that once we stop having these problems and inefficiencies and, you know,

382
00:46:00,193 --> 00:46:09,217
[SPEAKER_00]: deleted results that come from a severe shortage of staffing and outdated software.

383
00:46:11,258 --> 00:46:14,539
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't know it when those problems start to go away, but we're certainly seeing them now.

384
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exciting to me to see multiple voices in this room,

385
00:46:20,484 --> 00:46:21,564
[SPEAKER_00]: noticing the same problems.

386
00:46:21,604 --> 00:46:27,987
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we're identifying another area, like the legal department, that we really need the administration to target some investment into.

387
00:46:28,067 --> 00:46:35,229
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's hard to contemplate in this financial environment, making a multi-million dollar investment.

388
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,330
[SPEAKER_00]: But as President Beer said,

389
00:46:39,571 --> 00:46:54,820
[SPEAKER_00]: We're already spending a lot, not just in money, but in staff time on trying to use inefficient processes to do this work that we have to do anyway, and dealing with the problems that arise from doing it less efficiently than we have to.

390
00:46:56,521 --> 00:47:00,423
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that that can be a topic that we really elevate this budget season.

391
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:08,668
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a year when I think we have to be realistic, but I think that this is so foundational to so many departments that we can't afford to not

392
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:19,114
[SPEAKER_00]: prioritize the issue and at least try to get some, you know, in my recommendations, I put it forward as an area of study.

393
00:47:19,274 --> 00:47:26,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we at least invest in a consultant to look at our software and say, here's a plan for how to get there?

394
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we at least start there?

395
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:36,505
[SPEAKER_00]: If not looking at what would it look to really divert some funding into an investment in this fiscal year and know that that's

396
00:47:37,714 --> 00:47:43,036
[SPEAKER_00]: something that might feel short-term uncomfortable, but we have to think about the long-term downstream positive effects of that kind of investment.

397
00:47:43,316 --> 00:47:43,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

398
00:47:44,577 --> 00:47:45,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

399
00:47:45,037 --> 00:47:45,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scrivilli.

400
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:46,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

401
00:47:46,658 --> 00:47:59,743
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I appreciate Council Bears and our new Council at least starting this process, but, you know, for my newer colleagues, it's nice that there was a time when we used to get

402
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:11,931
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to get updates on a pretty regular basis, making sure that we were all caught up and understood what was going on in the day-to-day budgets here in the city.

403
00:48:11,971 --> 00:48:16,854
[SPEAKER_03]: So even the actuals that we're getting from our Chief of Staff, it's kind of sparse.

404
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:22,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we were receiving them until last one we received was August.

405
00:48:23,378 --> 00:48:27,302
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're redacted, so you really can't see much, but at least we got something from the administration.

406
00:48:28,043 --> 00:48:43,016
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that I think that I might disagree with Council Vice President Collins, the software that former financial director Aleesha Nunley had is the same software that we have today.

407
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:54,984
[SPEAKER_03]: she would give us a robust breakdown of our finances and preparing us for the upcoming budget, especially for the last few years.

408
00:48:55,704 --> 00:48:56,605
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been horrific.

409
00:48:56,665 --> 00:49:09,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we're celebrating starting in March because the truth of the matter is, I believe two years ago, we didn't even actually get a actual budget book, we didn't even receive one.

410
00:49:10,453 --> 00:49:11,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And neighboring communities

411
00:49:13,697 --> 00:49:18,298
[SPEAKER_03]: this process, working in municipality, I see things a little differently, because I'm part of that process.

412
00:49:19,399 --> 00:49:24,821
[SPEAKER_03]: We started, we started six weeks ago with our process in our department.

413
00:49:25,801 --> 00:49:29,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're already starting the pre budget meetings.

414
00:49:29,302 --> 00:49:38,225
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're actually getting updates from our finance office that gives us our budgets updated on a monthly basis.

415
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:39,705
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know where we are.

416
00:49:39,725 --> 00:49:39,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And

417
00:49:43,427 --> 00:49:44,248
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty impressive.

418
00:49:44,668 --> 00:49:47,991
[SPEAKER_03]: What we don't see here is there is a lack of transparency.

419
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:53,075
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor ran on transparency, but we're seeing a drastic opposite of that.

420
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:55,017
[SPEAKER_03]: There is really no transparency.

421
00:49:55,477 --> 00:50:03,203
[SPEAKER_03]: The software is there at least to keep us apprised of what's going on, but it's sparse at best.

422
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:06,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I told you, this is something we've asked for for years.

423
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:18,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're two years behind and we started getting redacted actuals in June, July, then August, and we haven't seen anything since, unless my colleagues can say otherwise.

424
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:21,146
[SPEAKER_03]: The last one I got was August.

425
00:50:21,466 --> 00:50:21,766
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it?

426
00:50:21,866 --> 00:50:23,748
[SPEAKER_03]: The Warren articles, the redacted Warren articles.

427
00:50:24,448 --> 00:50:25,569
[SPEAKER_03]: So we haven't seen anything.

428
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:30,374
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that, you know, Councilor Bears brings up a great point that, you know, not having,

429
00:50:31,934 --> 00:50:36,079
[SPEAKER_03]: funds really paying a huge impact and the issues we're seeing today.

430
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:37,281
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we talking about?

431
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:39,324
[SPEAKER_03]: What has been the biggest news lately?

432
00:50:39,484 --> 00:50:42,247
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest news lately is what's going on with the firefighters.

433
00:50:42,848 --> 00:50:49,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny, so what I did is I didn't just go to our fire department, I went to neighboring fire departments in the greater Boston area and I talked to

434
00:50:50,598 --> 00:50:51,458
[SPEAKER_03]: they talked to the fire.

435
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:55,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to deputy chief in Boston, and he broke down their process.

436
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:59,260
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to a deputy chief from Cambridge and in Somerville.

437
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:09,983
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've asked them, the biggest thing I see right here that's glaring, and you know, the overtime issue or the absentee issue wouldn't be an issue.

438
00:51:11,083 --> 00:51:19,065
[SPEAKER_03]: If our fire department is funded with 125 people that's supposed to, because they built in for absences.

439
00:51:20,274 --> 00:51:36,944
[SPEAKER_03]: And I asked questions that looked into some opportunities that hopefully we'll know soon that we'll see that our firefighters don't take sick days fraudulently.

440
00:51:38,184 --> 00:51:40,246
[SPEAKER_03]: They earn those days and they take those days.

441
00:51:40,406 --> 00:51:42,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we'll see one firefighter in the red.

442
00:51:43,342 --> 00:51:53,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think other departments in the city or other neighboring fire departments will have the same news.

443
00:51:53,066 --> 00:52:00,189
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're seeing the impact of our budget causing some serious divide in our community.

444
00:52:00,209 --> 00:52:08,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you've all seen it, that everybody's pointing fingers at us and everybody's pointing fingers at this person, everybody's pointing fingers at that person.

445
00:52:09,073 --> 00:52:11,474
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's funded properly, we wouldn't be in this mess.

446
00:52:12,938 --> 00:52:30,445
[SPEAKER_03]: if we had a team in the finance department that can bring all the information forward that's needed, like neighboring communities, because I'll give you, I can only speak for myself, but I'm in a municipality where we were in the rez for three years in our contracts, and we finally settled up.

447
00:52:31,386 --> 00:52:38,769
[SPEAKER_03]: It took two weeks to get the retro updated and then paid out to all the employees, and that was hundreds of employees.

448
00:52:39,793 --> 00:52:56,996
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the same software here, but for some reason, it's causing a huge, huge issue why the fire department hasn't gone near retro because I personally think either we don't have the money or we don't have the staffing that can do the job that's needed.

449
00:52:57,596 --> 00:53:02,277
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is why it's important to understand the processes as we're moving forward.

450
00:53:02,317 --> 00:53:06,618
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're gonna be, I'll say it a thousand times,

451
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:18,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the lack of growth and the lack of new money in the last four years, we're reaping the negative ramifications today.

452
00:53:19,732 --> 00:53:20,973
[SPEAKER_03]: There hasn't been a shovel in the ground.

453
00:53:21,594 --> 00:53:32,282
[SPEAKER_03]: We have major areas in our community that could be redeveloped into mixed use smart growth and development processes that will bring in millions and millions just in permit fees.

454
00:53:34,557 --> 00:53:44,209
[SPEAKER_03]: know, we talked about one of the projects that was that walked away from the city on Boston Ave, that just the permit fees alone was $6 million.

455
00:53:46,371 --> 00:53:47,713
[SPEAKER_03]: That would help any deficit.

456
00:53:48,995 --> 00:53:49,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

457
00:53:50,748 --> 00:53:57,173
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so there is so much that I see that wasted, wasted funds, wasted money.

458
00:53:57,794 --> 00:54:09,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I pray like Councilor Callahan says that we realized how important those ARPA positions were, both on the school side and the city side.

459
00:54:10,504 --> 00:54:12,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're seeing what's happening because, you know,

460
00:54:14,386 --> 00:54:17,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I we love Penelope, and she's changed that department.

461
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:25,012
[SPEAKER_03]: One person she came in, she was a one person army here, when method was going through a huge drug issue, suicide issue.

462
00:54:25,753 --> 00:54:26,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And she did amazing things.

463
00:54:27,033 --> 00:54:29,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think we celebrate that enough.

464
00:54:30,095 --> 00:54:40,421
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you talk to recovering addicts that live in our community, young people that I know, and I taught, they tell me that that office saved their lives and actually gave them a purpose.

465
00:54:40,961 --> 00:54:42,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Then our advocates for that.

466
00:54:43,023 --> 00:54:43,143
[SPEAKER_03]: And

467
00:54:44,397 --> 00:54:47,598
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's what I was told, that's an ARPA position.

468
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:58,824
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the fear of losing her job now that she's a young mom and have a family, she, she needs that sustainability and, and now she's gone.

469
00:54:59,664 --> 00:55:04,086
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so I think that we're in a position right now that, um,

470
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:11,678
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at creative way of funds funding is something that's needed.

471
00:55:11,738 --> 00:55:20,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate everybody sharing their their goals and I think that someone that's the senior member now, is that the first time I said that Kit?

472
00:55:21,181 --> 00:55:28,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the senior member now and I've sat through a lot of these both on the 16 years now on the school side of the school committee member now a city council

473
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:35,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen anything like we've seen in the last couple of years.

474
00:55:36,354 --> 00:55:37,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year was a very contentious budget.

475
00:55:40,831 --> 00:55:47,612
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we were angry with our colleagues and it kind of divided us in a sense because of the process.

476
00:55:48,193 --> 00:55:58,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy that Councilor Biaz has gone early with our vice president and talked with the mayor and started this process openly so it's not something that's being done on the 12th hour.

477
00:56:00,735 --> 00:56:05,856
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just so we can get something through so we can move on with our lives here in the city of Method.

478
00:56:05,876 --> 00:56:07,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

479
00:56:09,982 --> 00:56:13,383
[SPEAKER_05]: and I just wanted to, for my part, clarify on the software piece.

480
00:56:14,023 --> 00:56:18,585
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking about the payroll system software, not the financial, so I should have noted that.

481
00:56:18,665 --> 00:56:31,308
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, in my, but I just wanted to, my understanding is the issue is that the payroll software is an old, outdated system, and people are, you know, I'm watching people write payroll down every week on a piece of paper.

482
00:56:31,368 --> 00:56:32,569
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of nuts.

483
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:47,682
[SPEAKER_06]: carbon paper we just moved off the typewriter for something I think two weeks ago that's not a joke

484
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:07,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there was a serious question of what happens if the typewriter breaks?

485
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,201
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't fix it.

486
00:57:09,261 --> 00:57:11,282
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we want people to do the thing.

487
00:57:11,842 --> 00:57:14,883
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, when we talk about that issue.

488
00:57:16,424 --> 00:57:18,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're gonna need to borrow.

489
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,885
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll call Tom Hanks.

490
00:57:20,125 --> 00:57:21,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

491
00:57:22,826 --> 00:57:23,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lemingng.

492
00:57:25,424 --> 00:57:31,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I just like to thank the, I just like to riff off what my colleagues were saying.

493
00:57:33,083 --> 00:57:36,924
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem that we're facing is not misallocations of funds.

494
00:57:36,984 --> 00:57:40,646
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the fact that Medford doesn't have enough funding to begin with.

495
00:57:40,726 --> 00:57:47,428
[SPEAKER_09]: We have one of the lowest operating budgets for any major city of our size in the state of Massachusetts.

496
00:57:47,508 --> 00:57:55,011
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we are not going to get everything that we discussed and wanted to tonight.

497
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:57,611
[SPEAKER_09]: One point that I would like to make is that there are a few

498
00:57:59,372 --> 00:58:06,561
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a few items that were discussed that I think would substantially help with growth and getting more revenues in the future.

499
00:58:06,581 --> 00:58:10,126
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that it would be.

500
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:15,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to prioritize those those particular items.

501
00:58:15,352 --> 00:58:16,834
[SPEAKER_09]: So, for instance, I'm going to.

502
00:58:17,896 --> 00:58:35,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this will be more of a discussion point next week, but I'm going to strongly insist on having the money for these studies, the linkage fee study, for instance, that we could update those because that's something that in particular will help us get more revenues into the future and hopefully get us out of this.

503
00:58:36,656 --> 00:58:37,917
[SPEAKER_09]: get us out of this problem.

504
00:58:38,377 --> 00:58:43,540
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of the financial software that was discussed, I think falls into the same category.

505
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:51,224
[SPEAKER_09]: So when it comes to priorities, we should be looking at things that long-term will help with more revenue and more growth in the future.

506
00:58:51,344 --> 00:58:51,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

507
00:58:53,105 --> 00:58:53,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Lemingng.

508
00:58:55,407 --> 00:59:04,172
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have been able to sort these into some categories, which I can share here.

509
00:59:06,011 --> 00:59:07,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a moment.

510
00:59:26,628 --> 00:59:28,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure folks can see this.

511
00:59:31,237 --> 00:59:36,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to pull these out, and we had multiple people with a similar item.

512
00:59:36,801 --> 00:59:54,892
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried to put everyone's name next to it, but we have kind of the categories of preventing cuts and then recommendations around staffing increases as well as, and that includes like if we were recommending a change in compensation.

513
00:59:56,670 --> 01:00:01,034
[SPEAKER_05]: and then non-staffing increases, and then a few one-time expenses.

514
01:00:01,114 --> 01:00:11,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I left a further study here, Councilor Collins, around the paid family medical leave, but if you think, I couldn't quite figure out, it probably should go into staffing increases, but.

515
01:00:14,646 --> 01:00:17,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay, so I'll figure that out.

516
01:00:17,368 --> 01:00:23,173
[SPEAKER_05]: But in general, I think we could write this up

517
01:00:25,228 --> 01:00:31,575
[SPEAKER_05]: in a slightly clearer way, and then submit this to the mayor by March 22nd.

518
01:00:31,595 --> 01:00:33,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I like what we did last year.

519
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:37,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year, we had kind of a set of combined priorities.

520
01:00:37,422 --> 01:00:38,864
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of picked a top five.

521
01:00:39,524 --> 01:00:43,566
[SPEAKER_05]: and then also submitted everything that everyone had sent as an addendum.

522
01:00:44,426 --> 01:00:46,888
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know what folks want to do at this point.

523
01:00:47,068 --> 01:00:51,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I could, you know, we're at 7.15.

524
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:56,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I could share around a copy of this and we could schedule another meeting.

525
01:00:56,152 --> 01:01:05,016
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, folks could kind of say, here's my top five, and we could try to hone in on what the top five recommendations should be.

526
01:01:06,252 --> 01:01:07,953
[SPEAKER_05]: Or we could try to do that now.

527
01:01:09,513 --> 01:01:18,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I could try to do it based on things that got submitted multiple times.

528
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:22,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we could go through any kind of process that the body requests.

529
01:01:22,877 --> 01:01:24,897
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro, Vice President Collins.

530
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:33,079
[SPEAKER_02]: From my own perspective, it's a little hard for me to process numbers in this.

531
01:01:35,478 --> 01:01:37,379
[SPEAKER_02]: in this situation with the screens this way?

532
01:01:37,399 --> 01:01:40,381
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be okay if we could do it over email?

533
01:01:40,681 --> 01:01:42,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that a violation of OML?

534
01:01:43,583 --> 01:02:02,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, the best way that we could do that would be I could send out a document, and then people could, or I could have the clerk send out a document, then people could reply to the clerk with their top five based on that document, and then we could have another meeting to vote on it.

535
01:02:03,295 --> 01:02:04,936
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems like too much time.

536
01:02:05,762 --> 01:02:09,243
[SPEAKER_05]: we could probably make it work, but- It's not a meeting.

537
01:02:09,283 --> 01:02:09,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

538
01:02:10,123 --> 01:02:10,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

539
01:02:11,383 --> 01:02:13,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins and then Councilor Tseng.

540
01:02:15,304 --> 01:02:16,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Barras.

541
01:02:17,105 --> 01:02:29,148
[SPEAKER_00]: My preference in terms of where we go from here, I think that we built in a couple of weeks to move from individual council recommendations to full council recommendations.

542
01:02:31,168 --> 01:02:33,049
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this meeting put us in a pretty good,

543
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's a very clear.

544
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:37,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Ben diagram.

545
01:02:37,381 --> 01:02:38,462
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff in the middle.

546
01:02:39,383 --> 01:02:49,989
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally I would be comfortable with the process where either this kind of informal document is shared out by the clerk to all Councilors and Councilors get back to the clerk with perhaps a ranking of their.

547
01:02:50,670 --> 01:03:02,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Top five, which as council leadership, you or I could assimilate into a document for us to vote on in a future committee of the whole, um, I think that it would be a pretty similar process if, um.

548
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:04,680
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think that we could, um.

549
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:05,081
[SPEAKER_00]: Yourself for myself.

550
01:03:05,101 --> 01:03:16,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Um just took a stab at, you know, tallying up what was submitted the most times make a version of that document, and then we could similarly look at it as a group at a future committee of the whole and then make some final decisions.

551
01:03:16,886 --> 01:03:20,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Um that evening and still have plenty of time to submit it before the 22nd.

552
01:03:20,908 --> 01:03:25,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that that will be, um, give Councilors time to digest, um,

553
01:03:33,795 --> 01:03:35,705
[SPEAKER_00]: without some time to order our rankings.

554
01:03:37,622 --> 01:03:38,482
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

555
01:03:38,522 --> 01:03:40,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng, then Councilor Callahan.

556
01:03:40,703 --> 01:03:42,403
[SPEAKER_04]: I concur with Vice President Collins.

557
01:03:42,503 --> 01:03:50,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, in my opinion, to do it right now without letting it sit with us for a little bit might be a little too rushed.

558
01:03:50,285 --> 01:04:06,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there are great ideas that my colleagues had that I didn't necessarily jot down, and I think it would be great to give, and I think a lot of us are in that same position, so it would be great for us to sit down and have that time to think about the proposals that have been laid out on the table.

559
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:18,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have noticed just scanning through what you presented, I think we have a lot of ideas that are basically the same idea, but just worded in slightly different ways.

560
01:04:18,436 --> 01:04:23,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's work to be done on combining those ideas as well.

561
01:04:23,739 --> 01:04:26,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a little bit of time would be nice.

562
01:04:26,501 --> 01:04:30,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the council leadership has built in time for us to discuss.

563
01:04:32,364 --> 01:04:34,405
[SPEAKER_04]: to discuss and compile.

564
01:04:34,825 --> 01:04:37,026
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would be happy.

565
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:44,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say I would concur with Vice President Collins and her recommendation to the Council.

566
01:04:48,771 --> 01:04:49,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

567
01:04:50,032 --> 01:04:50,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

568
01:04:51,693 --> 01:04:52,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

569
01:04:53,073 --> 01:04:57,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hear this sort of coming up with five.

570
01:04:57,655 --> 01:04:59,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious, what do our

571
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:03,837
[SPEAKER_01]: boil down recommendations look like?

572
01:05:03,857 --> 01:05:05,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we supposed to come up with five?

573
01:05:05,378 --> 01:05:09,702
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't say anything about that in the resolution.

574
01:05:10,543 --> 01:05:12,524
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we expecting this to look like?

575
01:05:12,684 --> 01:05:13,986
[SPEAKER_01]: How many is too many?

576
01:05:15,627 --> 01:05:16,788
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we want?

577
01:05:18,489 --> 01:05:25,736
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to just give my opinion on that, which is just, I think, deciding what we think is the most.

578
01:05:30,182 --> 01:05:40,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's overlap, so I don't want to overestimate it, but we probably have 25, maybe 30 recommendations.

579
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:47,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, a lot of the ones in the prevent cuts are pretty much the same.

580
01:05:47,196 --> 01:05:49,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we could almost boil that down into one, right?

581
01:05:49,758 --> 01:05:55,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Like don't, you know, or one or two, you know, meet these budget requests, do not cut these positions, et cetera.

582
01:05:58,325 --> 01:05:58,845
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's,

583
01:06:00,253 --> 01:06:21,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's kind of a signal noise type, just like thought process of like, if we send 30 things over to the mayor, who's already thinking about 300 things, will it get lost versus, you know, and even for my set of recommendations, like, increase funding for code enforcement in the building department.

584
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:26,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I want it, but we've been it's been a request for 10 years.

585
01:06:26,173 --> 01:06:26,914
[SPEAKER_05]: It hasn't happened.

586
01:06:26,994 --> 01:06:27,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

587
01:06:27,255 --> 01:06:35,686
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not voting that a top 5, but, you know, level service funding for the schools are retaining the positions.

588
01:06:35,727 --> 01:06:37,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are really important right now.

589
01:06:37,429 --> 01:06:37,870
[SPEAKER_05]: This year.

590
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:44,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's really more, it's more just saying, here are our top priorities.

591
01:06:44,391 --> 01:06:46,752
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also here's what every Councilor thinks.

592
01:06:46,812 --> 01:06:51,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's really on the mayor and the finance staff to incorporate what they think they can incorporate.

593
01:06:52,354 --> 01:06:58,376
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's also drawing and beginning to draw lines for budget negotiations.

594
01:06:58,396 --> 01:07:04,219
[SPEAKER_05]: So in a sense, kind of, I think we have had for the last two budget cycles,

595
01:07:08,672 --> 01:07:14,656
[SPEAKER_05]: lines in the sand of this is what, if you want the budget to pass, here's what we think needs to be in it.

596
01:07:15,397 --> 01:07:22,161
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been successful in making sure, for example, that the zoning study funding was included.

597
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:27,965
[SPEAKER_05]: We did keep the solicitor's positions in the budget, even though there hasn't been hiring for them.

598
01:07:28,105 --> 01:07:35,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think now we're maybe going back to the plate on that one and saying, well, OK, you've kept it in the budget.

599
01:07:35,890 --> 01:07:37,892
[SPEAKER_05]: You promised it for three years, but no one's in the position.

600
01:07:38,832 --> 01:07:43,876
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your plan to increase the funding so that we can get someone hired in those roles?

601
01:07:45,317 --> 01:07:49,400
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of, I think, the shape of the discussion.

602
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:55,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll leave it at that, and I'll go to Vice President Collins.

603
01:07:57,025 --> 01:07:57,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

604
01:07:57,285 --> 01:08:03,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an important question, especially for the folks for whom this is the first budget season.

605
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:05,491
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate

606
01:08:06,991 --> 01:08:12,285
[SPEAKER_00]: President Barris' overview of what I think is a reasonable way to approach this.

607
01:08:13,348 --> 01:08:13,769
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of

608
01:08:14,830 --> 01:08:18,412
[SPEAKER_00]: what I would propose we, you know, what we literally send to the administration.

609
01:08:18,432 --> 01:08:28,119
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that what we did last year, probably the year before that as well, we go through this process of Councilors submitting individual recommendations.

610
01:08:28,179 --> 01:08:29,660
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about our shared priorities.

611
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:40,327
[SPEAKER_00]: We come to some form of consensus about, we all come in with our individual rankings, individual priorities, and we find what is the middle of that Venn diagram.

612
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:41,707
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the things that we're going to say?

613
01:08:43,068 --> 01:08:43,929
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 30 things we want.

614
01:08:45,384 --> 01:08:48,385
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to ask for five and hopefully get one or two.

615
01:08:50,506 --> 01:08:57,428
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to hone in on those shared areas of most importance.

616
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:01,970
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, I think, the first page of the packet.

617
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:07,171
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think what we did last year was we also included every Councilor's individual memos.

618
01:09:08,272 --> 01:09:13,994
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would propose that we also, of course, include the minutes of these meetings so that the administration has

619
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:22,879
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that thorough overview of our discussion, has the record of everything that we put on the table, everything that we thought was important to raise.

620
01:09:23,379 --> 01:09:28,723
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to, out of all of that, here's that shorter list of things that we really have to say.

621
01:09:32,945 --> 01:09:37,849
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, in terms of next steps from here, I think that

622
01:09:38,922 --> 01:09:45,285
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that we have some space in the schedule to have a follow up committee of the whole to revisit this before the 22nd.

623
01:09:46,026 --> 01:09:51,249
[SPEAKER_00]: If fellow Councilors were amenable to it I'd be happy to make a motion for council leadership to

624
01:09:53,092 --> 01:09:56,155
[SPEAKER_00]: circulate this aggregated document among fellow Councilors.

625
01:09:58,116 --> 01:10:12,669
[SPEAKER_00]: By the end of the week, work to schedule a follow-up committee of the whole where we can digest it together, come up with a shared shortlist of priorities so that we can stick to that timeline of submitting it to the administration by the 22nd along with Councilors individual memos and the records of this meeting.

626
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:14,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

627
01:10:15,351 --> 01:10:16,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

628
01:10:16,852 --> 01:10:17,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Galliard.

629
01:10:21,135 --> 01:10:24,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask, should I email mine, or is it okay?

630
01:10:24,718 --> 01:10:26,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have reasonable notes from what I said?

631
01:10:26,220 --> 01:10:31,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I could tell you what I have.

632
01:10:31,504 --> 01:10:40,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it would be helpful to email them to me and the clerk, because I want to make sure that they get included in the packet, even if they are not.

633
01:10:40,232 --> 01:10:43,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just want to make sure they get included in that.

634
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I will do that right now.

635
01:10:45,277 --> 01:10:45,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
