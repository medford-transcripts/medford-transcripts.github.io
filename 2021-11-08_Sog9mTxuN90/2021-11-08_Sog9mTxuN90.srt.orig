1
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:45,794
[SPEAKER_12]: stands one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

2
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:49,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin, would you please call the roll?

3
00:07:49,376 --> 00:07:52,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

4
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:55,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

5
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

6
00:07:58,181 --> 00:07:59,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin, here.

7
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:01,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McStone, not here.

8
00:08:01,803 --> 00:08:02,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Rousseau?

9
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:03,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Here.

10
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:04,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Van de Kloet?

11
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:05,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

12
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:07,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Longo Kern, not here.

13
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:16,010
[SPEAKER_12]: So with five present and two absent, we have a quorum and the meeting can proceed.

14
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:21,757
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Superintendent, if I could ask you now to take over.

15
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:23,012
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

16
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:24,154
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

17
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:28,618
[SPEAKER_13]: This evening we're going to have an opportunity to look at our MCAS results.

18
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:35,746
[SPEAKER_13]: We will have a slide presentation, and that presentation will begin with science.

19
00:08:36,387 --> 00:08:40,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr Rocco Cieri our director of science will present the science

20
00:08:41,832 --> 00:08:51,898
[SPEAKER_13]: information, followed by Miss Pfizer current who will present mathematics, and Dr Nicole keys who will be presenting for us.

21
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,600
[SPEAKER_13]: So without much further ado, Dr cushion.

22
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, thank you members of the committee and Dr. Edward Vincent.

23
00:09:02,764 --> 00:09:10,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Prior to beginning, wanted to just give you a little bit of the pandemic induced shifts that occurred as a result.

24
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:14,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesse made significant shifts regarding MCAS.

25
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:23,901
[SPEAKER_07]: So Jesse allowed some assessments to be taken from home ELA and math grades three through eight and the science technology engineering exam grade five.

26
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:30,526
[SPEAKER_07]: STE grade nine was only available as a paper based assessment, there was no computer based option.

27
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:37,170
[SPEAKER_07]: Remote only high school students could opt out of the STE MCAS.

28
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:46,934
[SPEAKER_07]: However you look at that, the students now will be required to take the chemistry STE exam.

29
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:49,975
[SPEAKER_07]: So students in the freshman class take biology.

30
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:54,796
[SPEAKER_07]: These students in the sophomore class will take STE.

31
00:09:55,357 --> 00:09:59,958
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are modified competency determinations for classes 21, which graduated 22 and 23.

32
00:10:06,227 --> 00:10:07,409
[SPEAKER_07]: One more quick slide.

33
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:13,638
[SPEAKER_07]: This year, there were no accountability ratings for elementary and secondary education.

34
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:17,443
[SPEAKER_07]: There were none at the school district or state level for accountability.

35
00:10:18,124 --> 00:10:23,031
[SPEAKER_07]: And now actually Pfizer is going to go first.

36
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:34,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

37
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:37,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, members of the school committee.

38
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:44,586
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to start off by looking at slide four.

39
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:48,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Cushing, we have it up.

40
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:53,528
[SPEAKER_06]: The mean SGPs for the grade levels are here for grade five.

41
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:55,149
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 28.53 for grade six.

42
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,429
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 23.85 for grade seven, 41.6.

43
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,131
[SPEAKER_06]: For grade eight, 35.8, and for grade 10, it was 35.4.

44
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:17,154
[SPEAKER_06]: In the report on page, and I can pull it up, there is a comparison between the state and the district.

45
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:19,735
[SPEAKER_06]: It is on page 14.

46
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:21,976
[SPEAKER_12]: On page what, Plaza?

47
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:22,596
[SPEAKER_06]: On page 14.

48
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:23,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

49
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,297
[SPEAKER_06]: If you would like to take a look.

50
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,202
[SPEAKER_02]: on page 14 of the report.

51
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,504
[SPEAKER_06]: never end.

52
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:11,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Page 14 of the MCAS mathematics report.

53
00:12:12,405 --> 00:12:21,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to move on to the next slide, please, for the Mathematics 2021 MCAS action items.

54
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:22,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

55
00:12:24,248 --> 00:12:31,093
[SPEAKER_06]: The mathematics department is working on the following initiatives to bring greater coherence to mathematics instruction K through 12.

56
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:40,259
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition, the eventual adoption of a new elementary mathematics program promises to further prepare our students to engage in inquiry-based learning.

57
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:49,585
[SPEAKER_06]: These actions will further ensure that our youngest learners will have greater access to advanced mathematics learning opportunities in high school and beyond.

58
00:12:51,286 --> 00:13:04,818
[SPEAKER_06]: The mathematics action items include using Envision's mathematics program in elementary K through five classrooms, with the exception of 22 classrooms using Bridges and Investigations III.

59
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:12,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Bridges and investigations three are basically problem based inquiry based programs.

60
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:23,743
[SPEAKER_06]: They are in line with the new pedagogy and they rank very high on ed reports and their experience in the surrounding districts has been excellent.

61
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:30,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Number two, selecting a new elementary math program with the elementary math program review committee

62
00:13:31,292 --> 00:13:36,019
[SPEAKER_06]: We are anticipating that it'll be completed by March, April of 2022.

63
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:43,591
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll make a decision and we will come to you with the findings.

64
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:51,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Bullet three is using illustrative mathematics standard classes and big ideas and accelerated classes at the middle schools.

65
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:53,443
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been ongoing.

66
00:13:54,063 --> 00:14:04,407
[SPEAKER_06]: We are reorganizing middle school acceleration by teaching half of eighth grade standards in seventh grade and the other half in eighth grade, along with algebra one standards.

67
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:20,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas up until last year we were teaching seventh and eighth grade standards in seventh grade and teaching algebra one standards in eighth grade to the accelerated students, so that was two years worth of mathematics for the accelerated seventh grade students.

68
00:14:21,288 --> 00:14:35,075
[SPEAKER_06]: And we felt that we are in line with Desi's recommendation by splitting the standards half and half into two years rather than finishing up two years worth of standards in one.

69
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:39,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on, on the next page, on the next slide.

70
00:14:41,737 --> 00:14:51,441
[SPEAKER_06]: are reviewing grade six through 12 pacing guides and modifying sequence if needed to keep a balance between spiral learning and improving student performance on MCAS.

71
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:58,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Grades K through five will use program specific pacing guides for program assessment purposes.

72
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:02,746
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason is that we have 22 classrooms that are not using envisions 2020.

73
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:09,970
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to be allowing the teachers to use it with full fidelity.

74
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:18,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So we cannot use a district-wide pacing guide for our elementary math program right now.

75
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:24,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Developing and updating the core syllabi for new and existing courses.

76
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:36,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Extending the education opportunities for our 6th through 12th students in order to help them achieve their full potential through MPS 6th through 12th Equitable Math Pathways and Program Review Committee.

77
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:43,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like our elementary program review committee, we have been reviewing the secondary programs.

78
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:48,050
[SPEAKER_06]: We have been contemplating many different pathways for our students.

79
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:55,560
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to make sure it's equitable to them because not all students can learn through algebra, geometry, algebra pathway.

80
00:15:56,201 --> 00:16:06,644
[SPEAKER_06]: There is, for example, an integrated pathway that combines algebra and geometry for three years, subsequently leading to the calculus path.

81
00:16:07,164 --> 00:16:08,344
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be looking at that.

82
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:09,764
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, we already are.

83
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:16,626
[SPEAKER_06]: For the high school, for the middle school, we are looking at all our practices, for example, classroom participation rubric.

84
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:25,208
[SPEAKER_06]: We are looking at student self-assessment of group work rubric, just to be sure that we are equitable when we are

85
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:33,596
[SPEAKER_06]: when we are teaching and learning our Medford community students.

86
00:16:34,878 --> 00:16:44,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Providing additional resources to teachers to increase ability to teach more diverse elective courses at the MHS, MBTHS, and Curtis Tufts.

87
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:48,449
[SPEAKER_06]: We are also looking at what other courses we can offer our students.

88
00:16:49,831 --> 00:17:03,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Exploring options for the electives category that will combine with having additional resources because most of the additional resources will be needed for these electives if chosen.

89
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:09,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Shifting the focus of teaching and learning from procedural memorization to creative thinking.

90
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:11,609
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been the focus for last

91
00:17:12,855 --> 00:17:22,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Two years pandemic had put a barrier to it, but this is really the gist of it that we want to shift from procedural memorization to creative thinking.

92
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:30,153
[SPEAKER_06]: We are developing a departmental vision and a mission statement with an emphasis on 21st century problem solving skills.

93
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:36,578
[SPEAKER_06]: We are researching nationwide best mathematical practices and trends to incorporate in our classrooms.

94
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:44,725
[SPEAKER_06]: We have been promoting and will continue to promote inquiry based teaching and learning through professional development of our teachers.

95
00:17:46,961 --> 00:18:04,836
[SPEAKER_06]: and incorporating data-driven strategies using the data from our newly acquired NWEA Map Growth so that we can minimize learning loss due to COVID-19 and that we can also learn from this adaptive assessment.

96
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:11,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were the action items for mathematics for this year.

97
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:15,165
[SPEAKER_06]: And then now I'll move on to the highlights of the MCAS.

98
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:24,986
[SPEAKER_06]: So the high school grade 10 data slightly lagged behind the state in standards and domains by a two to 10 point differential in all categories.

99
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:30,709
[SPEAKER_06]: In the student growth percentile category, the high school was behind the state by 1.1 percentile.

100
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:41,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Given the extreme unusual conditions of the pandemic, we realized that we will continue to make consistent progress towards our goal of increased outcomes for all learners.

101
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:45,137
[SPEAKER_06]: The following data points are highlights from grades three through eight.

102
00:18:46,077 --> 00:18:53,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Grade 8 at Andrews Middle School data closely matched with the state's grade level data at 39% versus state's 41%.

103
00:18:54,639 --> 00:19:05,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Given the lower participation rate of 83% versus state's 93%, grade 8 at Andrews Middle School and McGlynn Middle School student growth percentile exceeded the state by 5.8%.

104
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:09,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Percentile points versus the state.

105
00:19:11,546 --> 00:19:22,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Grade seven at McGlynn Middle School exceeding expectations close closely matched with the state's grade level data at 5% versus state 6% and they had similar participation rates.

106
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:32,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Grade seven at Andrews Middle School and McGlynn Middle School student growth percentile exceeded the state by 8.4 percentile points versus the state

107
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:53,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Grade six at Andrews Middle School, exceeding expectations and meeting expectations categories total 39% versus states 34%, which is notably higher than the states exceeding and meeting expectations categories put together, given the lower participation rate at Andrews of 66% versus states 95%.

108
00:19:56,998 --> 00:20:00,099
[SPEAKER_06]: On slide eight, we continue on.

109
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:09,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Grade three at Mississippi Elementary School exceeding expectations is on par with the state at 5% despite a lower percentage rate than the state.

110
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:18,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Grade three at Roberts Elementary meeting expectations is on par with the state at 28% despite a lower participation rate than the state.

111
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:24,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Grade three at McGlynn Elementary School exceeding and meeting expectations categories total 39% versus state's 33%.

112
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:26,790
[SPEAKER_06]: you

113
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:44,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Grade five at Brooks Elementary School, exceeding expectations and meeting expectations categories total 42% versus states 33%, which is significantly higher than the state's exceeding and meeting expectations categories put together.

114
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Grade five at Brooks Elementary School, SGP is on par with the state.

115
00:20:49,002 --> 00:20:54,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Grade four at Brooks Elementary School, exceeding expectations and meeting expectations categories total 45% versus states 33%.

116
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:02,329
[SPEAKER_06]: and that is significantly higher than the state's two categories put together.

117
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:12,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I have put the rest of the data in the tables in the report that was presented to you.

118
00:21:14,336 --> 00:21:19,639
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not sure, would we like to take questions now or towards the end?

119
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:20,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Please advise.

120
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:28,395
[SPEAKER_12]: question.

121
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:31,818
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually do.

122
00:21:32,439 --> 00:21:38,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, one of the things that I noticed particularly when you're talking about the student growth percentage.

123
00:21:38,584 --> 00:21:38,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

124
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:48,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Is how significantly different grade seven and eight were than really what looked pretty consistent across the rest of the district.

125
00:21:49,052 --> 00:21:55,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Um so, I was just curious if you had dug into like why those two grades so significantly

126
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:05,486
[SPEAKER_03]: outperformed the state average versus like everyone else who didn't, but just sort of hovered underneath.

127
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:10,487
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just curious if there's something interesting going on there that you can share.

128
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:23,151
[SPEAKER_06]: So grade eight, the students who took grade eight were the first students who were exposed to the new math curriculum, illustrative mathematics.

129
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:26,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And grade seven is the one where we

130
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,768
[SPEAKER_06]: did not have accelerated path last year.

131
00:22:32,108 --> 00:22:38,631
[SPEAKER_06]: And the teachers were able to just hone in on grade seven standards to give them a stronger basis for grade eight.

132
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:47,255
[SPEAKER_06]: We did bring back the accelerated group this year, but last year it was very concentrated and focused effort only on grade seven standards.

133
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:51,457
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe those two made a difference.

134
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:52,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

135
00:22:53,793 --> 00:23:21,322
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to piggyback and say that that was part of a conversation that Miss Khan and I had about the middle school scores actually being solid this year, the strongest in the district in terms of their SGPs and attributing it to the investment in illustrative math, which is more inquiry based and really forcing the students to be critical thinkers of mathematics.

136
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:32,851
[SPEAKER_13]: and hoping for similar increased outcomes at the elementary levels as we're piloting new programs that are more inquiry based and really pushing those higher order thinking skills.

137
00:23:34,632 --> 00:23:34,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

138
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:39,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

139
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,596
[SPEAKER_08]: First, I have a process question.

140
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:48,358
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've had less than 48 hours with these documents since I was at the conference.

141
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:55,161
[SPEAKER_08]: And can you quickly give us an overview of the embargo date issue?

142
00:23:55,181 --> 00:24:00,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I just feel like I would have liked to have had two or three weeks with this, not less than two days.

143
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,824
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a lot of data.

144
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:06,965
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you all had more than 48 hours before you presented tonight.

145
00:24:07,782 --> 00:24:12,453
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe a lot of this has to do with the state's embargo rules, correct?

146
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:16,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Or have you had this and we could have had it weeks ago?

147
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:22,753
[SPEAKER_13]: You're asking, can you just restate your question one more time?

148
00:24:22,953 --> 00:24:23,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

149
00:24:23,293 --> 00:24:27,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So you all get this stuff in the, at the end of the summer, I understand, and it's embargoed.

150
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:29,737
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't tell anybody anything about it, right?

151
00:24:30,277 --> 00:24:30,977
[SPEAKER_08]: The data you get.

152
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:38,862
[SPEAKER_13]: When the data, yeah, I don't have the exact date right now when it was released, but we got the data and then we're disaggregating and analyzing the data.

153
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:39,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

154
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:48,106
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's an embargo date where you can tell us in this meeting, and that happens before the reports are sent to families.

155
00:24:48,347 --> 00:24:48,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

156
00:24:50,033 --> 00:24:51,924
[SPEAKER_08]: When is the report to families going?

157
00:24:53,335 --> 00:24:54,836
[SPEAKER_13]: We are shooting for this Friday.

158
00:24:55,376 --> 00:25:01,480
[SPEAKER_13]: The hard copy reports have come in and we just distributed them to the schools.

159
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,542
[SPEAKER_13]: So they are in the process of making labels and getting them.

160
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:13,546
[SPEAKER_13]: So the deadline is for us to have the mailings back on Friday to get it out in the mailings.

161
00:25:14,086 --> 00:25:18,709
[SPEAKER_13]: So parents will be able to get the results next week.

162
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:25,992
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so I guess I'm just trying to find out, is it possible in the future for us to have two weeks with this instead of 48 hours?

163
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:27,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Because this is a lot of data.

164
00:25:28,053 --> 00:25:36,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I love data, but it's also an awful lot of information for me to have tried to get through in the amount of time we had.

165
00:25:36,857 --> 00:25:38,718
[SPEAKER_08]: And I love that you all do the highlights.

166
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:43,800
[SPEAKER_08]: And not to sound negative, but I don't see a low lights option on the listing.

167
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:51,772
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I mean, I'm happy to celebrate the positives, but there's surely plenty in this data that is not something we're gonna celebrate.

168
00:25:52,472 --> 00:25:58,773
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, 48 hours after getting back from the conference is not enough time for me to do that.

169
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:03,814
[SPEAKER_08]: So is it possible in the future to get us this significantly?

170
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:10,616
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if it's not possible because of the embargo dates, that's what I'm wondering is like, is there a technical reason for which we can't get it earlier?

171
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:14,992
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know, if there is, then that's the way it is.

172
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:28,196
[SPEAKER_13]: We can definitely, I'm gonna just take note to make sure that once we're able to release the data, to get the data to you so that you have two weeks with it prior to this meeting.

173
00:26:28,556 --> 00:26:30,037
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, that would be wonderful.

174
00:26:30,397 --> 00:26:34,058
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is how it's happened in the other three times I've received this.

175
00:26:34,138 --> 00:26:39,420
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not like new that this is happening, but I did have a question though, Ms.

176
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Khan on,

177
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:49,344
[SPEAKER_08]: There's with the exception of 22 classrooms in this envisions are those why are there classrooms not using envisions.

178
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:51,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you've told me, but I forgot.

179
00:26:51,966 --> 00:27:08,034
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I just want to clarify that the 22 classrooms 12 with bridges and 10 with investigations are the piloting ones and and the other ones we move to envisions 2020 because envisions 2014 wasn't available.

180
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:11,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

181
00:27:11,208 --> 00:27:11,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

182
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:12,089
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my question.

183
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any other questions from members?

184
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:18,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Kretz?

185
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:19,274
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

186
00:27:19,735 --> 00:27:20,896
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just had one question.

187
00:27:21,716 --> 00:27:28,421
[SPEAKER_10]: So at the beginning, it does say like grades three to six, no calculators are allowed for either session.

188
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:31,583
[SPEAKER_10]: And then grades seven to eight, no calculators are allowed.

189
00:27:31,764 --> 00:27:32,524
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have a question.

190
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:37,728
[SPEAKER_10]: So my son, he used to have an accommodation to have a calculator present.

191
00:27:38,443 --> 00:27:45,170
[SPEAKER_10]: Is, is that something that if a student has an accommodation, you know, for their IEP, can they have the calculator?

192
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:46,912
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, yes.

193
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:52,938
[SPEAKER_06]: If that allows it and it's written in their IEP or a 504, we do provide calculator.

194
00:27:54,633 --> 00:28:03,898
[SPEAKER_10]: And just one more, and I know that my son also got like extra time to take the test, because he just required extra time.

195
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:08,160
[SPEAKER_10]: So if that was part of an accommodation, would that be allowed also?

196
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so MCAS is an untimed test.

197
00:28:12,222 --> 00:28:17,225
[SPEAKER_06]: So it can go on until 220 or whenever the school day ends.

198
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:29,331
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is done at the high school level, and Mr. Deleva and the principals are in better position to speak about it, is that there is no pressure on students to finish early.

199
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:36,415
[SPEAKER_06]: They can take their time and finish up until 2.20, and sometimes I have even seen it go on further in rare cases.

200
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:40,257
[SPEAKER_06]: So absolutely, we keep our students at the center of it.

201
00:28:41,683 --> 00:28:42,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And just one final one.

202
00:28:42,943 --> 00:28:47,146
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know Mr. Russo was mentioning like the low lights.

203
00:28:47,827 --> 00:29:00,455
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just had a question in the past, there was, you know, something that was like an MCAS, like Academy or extra support for students, you know, even it was, it was actually like a program.

204
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:03,437
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a grant that was written and was received.

205
00:29:03,537 --> 00:29:07,840
[SPEAKER_10]: And if the students, you know, needed support or assistance,

206
00:29:08,368 --> 00:29:17,715
[SPEAKER_10]: They could sign up for the program, which was highly encouraged to take the program and they would go in for a Saturday course it was something like eight to like 11.

207
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:28,883
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was you know it really helped with the skill taking you know just they did a lot of quizzing and just how to go through the questions and you know don't you know forget to.

208
00:29:29,432 --> 00:29:31,114
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, to answer a question.

209
00:29:31,134 --> 00:29:40,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anything yet, you know, in the works for something like that coming up in, you know, in the, you know, early winter, spring?

210
00:29:41,423 --> 00:29:44,286
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely something that we can work on.

211
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:49,411
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know that in summer, we offered Math Acceleration Academy.

212
00:29:50,611 --> 00:29:53,732
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think that went quite well.

213
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually taught one of the sections and had a great time.

214
00:29:57,294 --> 00:30:03,436
[SPEAKER_06]: So something like that and of that source, it's definitely food for thought.

215
00:30:03,716 --> 00:30:04,616
[SPEAKER_06]: We are open to it.

216
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:08,718
[SPEAKER_06]: We are happy to look into the resources and then go from there.

217
00:30:08,758 --> 00:30:11,318
[SPEAKER_06]: But yes, I do recall that it was there.

218
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:12,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

219
00:30:12,939 --> 00:30:13,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

220
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:13,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

221
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin.

222
00:30:16,408 --> 00:30:16,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

223
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Khan for the report.

224
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:24,346
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering where does the MCAS alt data live and the MCAS opt out data live?

225
00:30:27,154 --> 00:30:31,595
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not have access to MCAS opt-out data.

226
00:30:32,515 --> 00:30:33,736
[SPEAKER_06]: That will be the principles.

227
00:30:34,336 --> 00:30:39,558
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe Dr. Cushing and others have access to it.

228
00:30:39,718 --> 00:30:47,441
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have access to the opt-out data, but I'm happy to elaborate on the students who took the test.

229
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:49,681
[SPEAKER_06]: I can say more about it.

230
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:54,603
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you don't mind repeating your question, just so that I'm sure I'm answering it in its entirety.

231
00:30:56,703 --> 00:30:58,423
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't mind repeating your question.

232
00:30:58,663 --> 00:30:59,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.

233
00:30:59,044 --> 00:31:02,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just asking, I'm sorry, where does the MCAS-ALT data live?

234
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:09,986
[SPEAKER_04]: And where does, I think I heard you, I'm sorry, the mask is muffled and it's hard with the microphone, so I apologize.

235
00:31:10,066 --> 00:31:13,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And my hearing is probably not getting any better either over time.

236
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:17,688
[SPEAKER_04]: But did you say the opt-out data, you would defer to Dr. Cushing?

237
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:19,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I would definitely defer.

238
00:31:19,788 --> 00:31:22,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the MCAS-ALT data, where does that live?

239
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:27,058
[SPEAKER_06]: MCAS all data is also in the database by DESI.

240
00:31:27,458 --> 00:31:33,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe part of it will show up as the special.

241
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:43,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the scale score comparisons, if you look at that, in my report, it's on page 16.

242
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:50,885
[SPEAKER_06]: So part of it will probably show up as part of that, but not sure if it's entirely there.

243
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:54,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you wanna?

244
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:57,308
[SPEAKER_06]: So under the subgroup data, it might come in and join.

245
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:01,730
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's a separate report for the MCAS Alt data.

246
00:32:02,691 --> 00:32:07,053
[SPEAKER_11]: We get the results at the same time as the MCAS, but it goes directly to the parents.

247
00:32:07,574 --> 00:32:16,719
[SPEAKER_11]: We also get the binders back for the MCAS Alt, and we include the information in their individual special education binder.

248
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:25,824
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want, I can compile that information for you just to let you know who was progressing, that sort of thing, for the next time.

249
00:32:27,585 --> 00:32:35,588
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be really helpful, but if I might, Superintendent, if we can add that as part of the regular presentation moving forward, just that we have the MCAS-ALT as well.

250
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:40,589
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for folks who are watching that don't know, can you just explain what the MCAS-ALT is?

251
00:32:40,609 --> 00:32:50,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, so the MCAS-ALT is an assessment that our students with significant disabilities participate in when they're not able to take the standard test.

252
00:32:50,773 --> 00:32:53,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Typically, these students take the MCAS-ALT

253
00:32:54,794 --> 00:32:59,919
[SPEAKER_11]: They can start in grade three, we always look at can they take the standard MCAS evaluation.

254
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:10,989
[SPEAKER_11]: If they can't they do the MCAS alt assessment, they look at access points in regards to math, English and science, the same as any student without a disability would.

255
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:16,634
[SPEAKER_11]: And then data is collected to demonstrate their level of independence.

256
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:19,236
[SPEAKER_11]: have they mastered this goal?

257
00:33:19,716 --> 00:33:21,737
[SPEAKER_11]: What percentage have they mastered the goal?

258
00:33:21,897 --> 00:33:28,099
[SPEAKER_11]: And now all this is sent into the state and then they analyze us and tell us if they've progressed.

259
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:35,002
[SPEAKER_11]: And that also determines the next steps for goals and objectives for students in the upcoming school year.

260
00:33:35,911 --> 00:33:36,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

261
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:39,752
[SPEAKER_04]: So to be clear this that hasn't been part of these reports before.

262
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:40,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that accurate?

263
00:33:41,073 --> 00:33:41,733
[SPEAKER_11]: That's accurate.

264
00:33:41,773 --> 00:33:41,913
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

265
00:33:42,013 --> 00:33:42,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

266
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:47,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to make a motion that MCAS all data is part of these reports.

267
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:48,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving forward.

268
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:51,956
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a second second on the motion.

269
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:52,836
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor.

270
00:33:53,376 --> 00:33:54,777
[SPEAKER_12]: I all opposed.

271
00:33:55,797 --> 00:33:56,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes.

272
00:33:56,557 --> 00:33:56,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

273
00:33:58,198 --> 00:33:58,478
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

274
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:19,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair, Member McLaughlin, starting on page eight, the MCAS data listed there on the left column does talk about our participation percentage, which is obviously like it's broken down by school in these charts and by grade.

275
00:34:19,645 --> 00:34:29,310
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not aggregated, but I think overall the story is 97% participation across the state and our participation was less than that.

276
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,026
[SPEAKER_03]: which varied grade to grade and school to school, but overall less.

277
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:44,554
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think my question is just, is that an oddity for us?

278
00:34:45,035 --> 00:34:49,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we typically like run well below state average or is it just like

279
00:34:50,317 --> 00:34:56,743
[SPEAKER_13]: That it was definitely an oddity, I think, due to the pandemic, a lot of people families chose to opt out this past year.

280
00:34:56,763 --> 00:35:03,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's where all that data is but it is at the grade and and building level.

281
00:35:05,247 --> 00:35:07,148
[SPEAKER_03]: on those charts in case you were looking for those.

282
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:08,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

283
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:09,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

284
00:35:09,368 --> 00:35:10,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ms.

285
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:10,849
[SPEAKER_13]: Khan.

286
00:35:11,029 --> 00:35:11,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

287
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:17,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Khan, thank you so much for your report and for the dedication of yourself and all the mathematics teachers.

288
00:35:17,831 --> 00:35:18,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

289
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:19,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your time.

290
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:21,512
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

291
00:35:21,932 --> 00:35:27,774
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that up next we have Mr. Rocco Sieri from the Science Department.

292
00:35:28,535 --> 00:35:29,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Sieri, welcome.

293
00:35:33,503 --> 00:35:46,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening everybody will try to work through two different documents on on screen you'll see some graphs and a PowerPoint presentation that helps us navigate it in a more.

294
00:35:47,998 --> 00:35:57,648
[SPEAKER_00]: in a less table structured way, but you have access to the reports from which these slides have been assembled.

295
00:35:59,009 --> 00:36:03,174
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's probably a lot more detail in the report than there is in the slide.

296
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:07,538
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot easier for you to sort of delve in those details.

297
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:17,816
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, we test the MCAS in three grade levels for science, at grade 5, grade 8, and grade 9 or 10.

298
00:36:19,213 --> 00:36:32,215
[SPEAKER_00]: At grade five, the data that you're seeing in the slide relates back to the page three chart for the 2021 administration.

299
00:36:33,035 --> 00:36:38,436
[SPEAKER_00]: And it compares the district scores with the state scores.

300
00:36:39,276 --> 00:36:47,538
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see that we trail the state by 11 percentage points if you're looking at the exceeding and the meeting category.

301
00:36:48,998 --> 00:37:00,104
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a sort of a bump up for us at the partially meeting and then not meeting expectations, but it's not far from the state in those two categories.

302
00:37:02,865 --> 00:37:12,370
[SPEAKER_00]: In science, we've traditionally reported on the exceeding meeting and partially meeting, and this change happened in 2019.

303
00:37:14,111 --> 00:37:25,016
[SPEAKER_00]: when we went to the new types of standards that's written at the beginning of the report, where the standard setting for that particular exam was established.

304
00:37:25,196 --> 00:37:36,881
[SPEAKER_00]: So the students, we as a faculty and as a district have only seen these rating parameters for two tests total.

305
00:37:38,142 --> 00:37:42,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, we went with advanced, proficient, needs improvement and warning.

306
00:37:42,895 --> 00:37:47,816
[SPEAKER_00]: And where they were setting the bar for those particular tests were at different places.

307
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:55,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've only got two years of data 2019 and 2021 the 2020 exam was canceled.

308
00:37:55,979 --> 00:37:57,639
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have that data to go by.

309
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:04,561
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, there are some differences in the schools that is in the report.

310
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:05,802
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not on the slide.

311
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:16,735
[SPEAKER_00]: is just, you know, if we include all of the different highlights or, you know, it needs improvements, then it becomes a pretty cumbersome slide.

312
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:19,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to cut some things out, but leave it in the report.

313
00:38:20,156 --> 00:38:29,018
[SPEAKER_00]: At grade five at the McGlynn and the Roberts, 33% and 34% scored in needs, sorry, in exceeding and meeting and at the Brooks and 30% and at the Missittuck, it was 21%.

314
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:50,419
[SPEAKER_00]: So, our action items for that particular grade level and you have to sort of go through a different part of the report but it's summarized here on the slide that we have a few action items.

315
00:38:53,411 --> 00:39:13,989
[SPEAKER_00]: We've invested in a new type of exam NWA map growth, and we've included science in that we think it's a very powerful way of understanding where students are in the course of their learning, it'll allow us to test, a couple of times per year at grade three and grade four and understand how they're growing in their science learning.

316
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:28,203
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once at grade five so that we can sort of anticipate where students may be as they approach the MCAS before it's administered and the teachers can use that data to be able to address some of the needs of the students.

317
00:39:29,925 --> 00:39:33,146
[SPEAKER_00]: We also look at the MCAS items that have been released.

318
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:36,968
[SPEAKER_00]: This year they released a lot less than usual.

319
00:39:37,368 --> 00:39:41,969
[SPEAKER_00]: The students themselves only took one half of what is a typical administration.

320
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:57,035
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these, some of the categories may be sort of like lower than what we would expect because they are taking less test questions than they have in the past and they took it completely online.

321
00:39:57,075 --> 00:39:58,115
[SPEAKER_00]: So the students that were

322
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:07,331
[SPEAKER_00]: either in a remote or in an in-person setting, we're taking the exam online and only taking half of that.

323
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:14,737
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I said, I'm trying to summarize the entire report, try to give you a story of what is found in there.

324
00:40:15,437 --> 00:40:21,902
[SPEAKER_00]: The details in the report are deeper, but at least you have a broad stroke view of what's going on.

325
00:40:23,777 --> 00:40:30,601
[SPEAKER_00]: The third bullet point, sorry, the fourth bullet point where we're looking at student journaling, checklists, and observations.

326
00:40:31,102 --> 00:40:34,904
[SPEAKER_00]: These really go to the FOST program.

327
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:36,405
[SPEAKER_00]: They come right out of the program.

328
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:39,127
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how students are assessed in their learning.

329
00:40:40,107 --> 00:40:49,673
[SPEAKER_00]: At the lowest grade levels, K1 and 2, you're really looking at checklists as kids do their learning, and they may be doing some simpler journaling.

330
00:40:51,314 --> 00:40:57,082
[SPEAKER_00]: and also some observation, teacher observations of their work as they go through the activities.

331
00:40:58,444 --> 00:41:08,914
[SPEAKER_00]: As they get older in the grades three to five, there's greater dependence on the notebooking that the students do as a scientific investigator.

332
00:41:09,014 --> 00:41:23,247
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some assessment that looks at some of MCAS like questions that are found in the program and students really, they do more writing for their responses so that teachers really see what the thinking behind some of their ideas are.

333
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,086
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the pieces that we'd be looking at and continue to reinforce in classrooms.

334
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:42,121
[SPEAKER_00]: We will continue to work with our other departments, especially in special education and EL to see how we can support the needs of the students ensure that you know the.

335
00:41:43,328 --> 00:41:47,269
[SPEAKER_00]: the program itself is being implemented with some fidelity in those classrooms.

336
00:41:47,749 --> 00:42:00,494
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've really made such a robust investment in the program and have added kits due to how the pandemic restrictions were placed that we really wanted to have classroom sets of things.

337
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:03,535
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've added those in by classroom last year.

338
00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:07,596
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to do that and we continue that this year as well.

339
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:12,257
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're moving in the correct direction in terms of our action items.

340
00:42:12,837 --> 00:42:17,338
[SPEAKER_00]: It hopefully will lead to a greater strength in our scores over time.

341
00:42:17,598 --> 00:42:20,799
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously grade five is an endpoint for that.

342
00:42:21,399 --> 00:42:27,601
[SPEAKER_00]: At grade eight, we can see that we really match the state pretty closely.

343
00:42:28,781 --> 00:42:29,941
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very, very close.

344
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:34,782
[SPEAKER_00]: And at exceeding, it's almost identical.

345
00:42:34,942 --> 00:42:36,863
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're off by one percentage point.

346
00:42:38,715 --> 00:42:51,852
[SPEAKER_00]: a few percentage points within three or four percentage points at grade eight, and then even the not meeting expectations is a bit lower than the state, but by one percentage point.

347
00:42:52,755 --> 00:42:57,558
[SPEAKER_00]: There again, we're gonna be using the NWA map at grade six and seven.

348
00:42:57,578 --> 00:42:59,639
[SPEAKER_00]: So we administer it twice a year.

349
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:02,761
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a single classroom test.

350
00:43:03,362 --> 00:43:09,205
[SPEAKER_00]: So the students will be able to, we'll be able to see as educators how the students are growing and what they know.

351
00:43:09,726 --> 00:43:16,210
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at grade eight, it'll give us that sort of preview of what we think they might be able to do on the MCAS.

352
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:26,273
[SPEAKER_00]: We also use our department meetings looking at the data and looking at strategies that might help our students perform better on the exam.

353
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:38,038
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at individual exam items or areas where we can identify patterns in the data behind the questions and the difficult questions that the students have.

354
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:58,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, unfortunately this year they only took half of the test it was an online test so some of the data is missing on the item analysis because the state did not release that data so we only know of the item analysis, sorry of the test questions but we don't know the categories in which they live for our district.

355
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:04,010
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually can change the slide, I believe.

356
00:44:05,391 --> 00:44:06,812
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go to the high school.

357
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:15,058
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you sort of see a lot of consistency with the state at the high school level.

358
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:27,025
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanna remind the committee that this was the first year that we transitioned from introductory physics and biology as a ninth grade or 10th grade option to strictly biology.

359
00:44:27,446 --> 00:44:30,768
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were looking year to year and you notice the sudden drop,

360
00:44:31,328 --> 00:44:44,691
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is because only the honors biology students were the ones taking the exam prior to this, and this is the first time we see all students in our school taking the biology tests.

361
00:44:45,111 --> 00:44:51,493
[SPEAKER_00]: So the aim was to see some parallel with the state and we see that these were all ninth graders.

362
00:44:52,513 --> 00:45:04,445
[SPEAKER_00]: The state in different depending on what city you live in biology might be offered freshman year or sophomore year so embedded in the state data our freshmen and sophomores, all of our freshmen took it as took it.

363
00:45:05,947 --> 00:45:10,912
[SPEAKER_00]: So, actually, I shouldn't say all of them, all the students that were able to take it took it.

364
00:45:11,232 --> 00:45:24,958
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a paper based exam, so you had to be taking this particular exam in in school, and it was graded as a legacy m cast exam, which means it uses the advanced proficient needs improvement and warning failing level.

365
00:45:27,777 --> 00:45:35,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we'll still be, again, using the NWA map for science at grades nine and 10 for the same reasons we'd be using it at the other grade levels.

366
00:45:37,281 --> 00:45:40,782
[SPEAKER_00]: We will continue to support our students taking the MCAS exams.

367
00:45:41,642 --> 00:45:55,847
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually a small clarification based on what was discussed earlier, the students who took biology last year as ninth graders, but did not take the exam are still able to take the retest this year.

368
00:45:56,748 --> 00:45:58,709
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not have to take the chemistry.

369
00:45:59,029 --> 00:46:03,692
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take the biology retake just as they would before.

370
00:46:03,732 --> 00:46:12,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I think earlier on in one of the slides, it had said that they had to take the chemistry, but they can take the biology as long as they've taken the course.

371
00:46:13,197 --> 00:46:15,859
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's helpful to these kids in particular.

372
00:46:16,379 --> 00:46:25,905
[SPEAKER_00]: So the freshmen from last year, the current sophomores and the current freshmen are the only ones that are required to attain

373
00:46:26,555 --> 00:46:28,677
[SPEAKER_00]: competency determination on the MCAS.

374
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:32,660
[SPEAKER_00]: The juniors and the seniors were exempt from that because of the pandemic.

375
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:42,067
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna be sort of trying to figure out how to get these students to make sure that they have great success.

376
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:47,411
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a small number of students that we have to get over that hurdle in the next couple of years.

377
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:51,234
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we'll be pretty successful at that.

378
00:46:52,695 --> 00:46:52,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

379
00:46:54,364 --> 00:47:01,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me, first, Member McLaughlin, would you please note that Member McStone joined the meeting?

380
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:02,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

381
00:47:02,726 --> 00:47:03,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

382
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:04,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Russo?

383
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:05,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

384
00:47:05,807 --> 00:47:16,429
[SPEAKER_08]: You said a small number of students, but wouldn't all remote ninth graders last year have not taken the paper-based MCAS?

385
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Some students came and took it.

386
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:20,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, some did?

387
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

388
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:22,971
[SPEAKER_00]: They were given the option to take.

389
00:47:32,013 --> 00:47:33,694
[SPEAKER_12]: and school to leave us joining us.

390
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:35,515
[SPEAKER_09]: This is labor principle of metric high school.

391
00:47:36,335 --> 00:47:43,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it was a requirement to have everybody come in, but the choice was that, you know, some students didn't.

392
00:47:43,879 --> 00:47:53,905
[SPEAKER_09]: But for the most part, the state had said that everybody should have come in to take the test because for the high school is to determine competency determination a little different at the lower levels.

393
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:58,287
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, you know, we encouraged

394
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:06,421
[SPEAKER_09]: because, and we put that information out to families, but if they chose not to send their child in, then that's what occurred.

395
00:48:07,021 --> 00:48:07,902
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly remember that.

396
00:48:07,922 --> 00:48:09,363
[SPEAKER_08]: And we chose not to send our child in.

397
00:48:09,503 --> 00:48:10,684
[SPEAKER_08]: We would have sent them in all year.

398
00:48:11,044 --> 00:48:12,925
[SPEAKER_08]: We probably got one of my emails about this, so.

399
00:48:12,985 --> 00:48:13,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably, okay.

400
00:48:13,906 --> 00:48:20,471
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but we were, it was not lots of kids that are now in 10th grade that have taken no competency tests.

401
00:48:20,491 --> 00:48:24,874
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've been analyzing the data that it's not as great.

402
00:48:24,894 --> 00:48:25,855
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we allowed,

403
00:48:26,718 --> 00:48:27,739
[SPEAKER_09]: certain things occur.

404
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:31,621
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, a student was just to come in to take the MCAS and then they could go back home.

405
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:39,385
[SPEAKER_09]: So there was a lot of options that we were trying to do to get a participation rate to where the state wanted it, whether we agreed with it or not.

406
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:41,446
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we were told to do.

407
00:48:41,506 --> 00:48:42,867
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

408
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:43,507
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

409
00:48:45,228 --> 00:48:45,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin.

410
00:48:46,148 --> 00:48:54,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just as a follow-up on that question, Mr. DeLay, but actually, so students that were in 10th grade that had this for a competency exam for graduation,

411
00:48:55,112 --> 00:48:57,693
[SPEAKER_04]: and did not take it, what was the outcome for that?

412
00:48:57,753 --> 00:48:59,194
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's ninth grade.

413
00:48:59,294 --> 00:49:00,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, only ninth grade.

414
00:49:00,515 --> 00:49:02,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Only ninth grade for biology.

415
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:15,803
[SPEAKER_09]: So their options moving forward is they can take it this February coming up on a retest, or as was mentioned before, they can take the chemistry within the 10th grade.

416
00:49:16,924 --> 00:49:17,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

417
00:49:18,725 --> 00:49:20,286
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are other options to do.

418
00:49:21,613 --> 00:49:28,195
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, we'll try to keep making sure that those options are available for our students, because that's what determines the diploma, right?

419
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:30,076
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

420
00:49:30,636 --> 00:49:30,977
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

421
00:49:31,217 --> 00:49:31,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one more question.

422
00:49:31,717 --> 00:49:32,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Ruscio.

423
00:49:32,617 --> 00:49:32,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

424
00:49:33,898 --> 00:49:36,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I just noticed that actually the biology

425
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:44,533
[SPEAKER_08]: exam, if I'm reading it correctly, is actually the only one that doesn't list, oh, and the physics, oh, the physics is irrelevant, sorry.

426
00:49:44,573 --> 00:49:48,435
[SPEAKER_08]: The biology one doesn't list participation rates and like every other one.

427
00:49:48,515 --> 00:49:56,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, it did not, we did not have that data in the forms that were available from the state on it, but I believe it's above 90%.

428
00:49:57,959 --> 00:50:00,280
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very high.

429
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,742
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small number of students that did not take the exam.

430
00:50:03,962 --> 00:50:04,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

431
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,723
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could just add to,

432
00:50:07,185 --> 00:50:08,526
[SPEAKER_09]: regarding the biology exam.

433
00:50:09,226 --> 00:50:16,151
[SPEAKER_09]: This year coming up, we're moving away from the legacy bio exam, and we're going to the next generation, which will be online.

434
00:50:16,171 --> 00:50:20,214
[SPEAKER_09]: This will be the first year that our ninth graders will be taking biology online.

435
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:34,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Every other test has on online, but because we've been doing legacy, and the reason why is because your grades are so spread out, it's five, eight, and then 10.

436
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:36,133
[SPEAKER_09]: or I'm sorry, ninth.

437
00:50:37,154 --> 00:50:43,759
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea was that students got used to taking the online version until when they get to high school competency determination.

438
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:49,124
[SPEAKER_09]: So this will be the year that they're taking it online, except for February.

439
00:50:49,444 --> 00:50:50,926
[SPEAKER_09]: February is still the makeup on paper.

440
00:50:53,408 --> 00:50:55,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Science has to be complicated, unfortunately.

441
00:50:56,611 --> 00:50:58,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

442
00:50:58,672 --> 00:51:01,135
[SPEAKER_03]: What year did we fully implement FOSS?

443
00:51:04,788 --> 00:51:06,189
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018, I believe.

444
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:07,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

445
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:15,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And you made a comment about how we did something different by providing all classrooms kits.

446
00:51:16,537 --> 00:51:21,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there were there were some classrooms that were sharing a kit.

447
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:23,903
[SPEAKER_00]: That is no longer the case.

448
00:51:24,364 --> 00:51:26,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single classroom has a kit now.

449
00:51:26,665 --> 00:51:30,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, can we make sure that continues to be the case even when the pandemic is over?

450
00:51:30,308 --> 00:51:30,489
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

451
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:31,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

452
00:51:31,324 --> 00:51:33,145
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually was a good, it was a good bet.

453
00:51:33,305 --> 00:51:33,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

454
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:47,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I was, I was actually honestly a little surprised that the, there was not like more lift in the fifth grade MCAS scores because we have FOSS in place and it's been there for a couple of years.

455
00:51:47,295 --> 00:51:52,679
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I'm hoping that you all are looking at what supports

456
00:51:53,283 --> 00:52:05,671
[SPEAKER_03]: perhaps teachers need in terms of professional development to really allow that curriculum to shine, because I think it's a pretty fabulous curriculum overall, as we reviewed it many years ago now.

457
00:52:06,052 --> 00:52:09,974
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it has enormous potential for our students.

458
00:52:10,054 --> 00:52:20,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that we can, so, I mean, everywhere else, we sort of stayed the same relative to the state or made a slight improvement at the high school level.

459
00:52:20,882 --> 00:52:21,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a,

460
00:52:23,633 --> 00:52:34,182
[SPEAKER_03]: we closed the gap a bit, but at the elementary school, we went in the opposite direction, which isn't what I would have expected to see with the implementation of like a real cohesive curriculum.

461
00:52:34,302 --> 00:52:43,549
[SPEAKER_03]: So just hoping we can take a look at that and figure out if there's something else going on that we need to address so that at budget time, you can bring that to us and we can take care of it.

462
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:44,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

463
00:52:45,651 --> 00:52:45,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

464
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:47,613
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

465
00:52:49,074 --> 00:52:49,334
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

466
00:52:51,137 --> 00:52:52,298
[SPEAKER_04]: I did have a follow up question.

467
00:52:52,338 --> 00:52:53,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for this report.

468
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:59,825
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just looking at the subgroup data, which thank you very much for including that page nine and 10.

469
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:15,138
[SPEAKER_04]: And so across the board for that data, which is our students with disabilities, high needs, EL, economically disadvantaged, African American, black, Asian, Hispanic, Latino, multi-race, non-Hispanic, Latino, and white, for the most part,

470
00:53:16,142 --> 00:53:32,247
[SPEAKER_04]: we're lower than state standard across the board with the exception of high school, where we have African-American black are higher than the state score, but otherwise we're pretty much below the state score across the board.

471
00:53:32,267 --> 00:53:43,071
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just wondering if you could speak to that, or I know that it says that this is not the accountability data calculation for the subgroups, but it's a measure of the subgroups achievement score by percent of students.

472
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:47,713
[SPEAKER_04]: scoring in the category of exceeding or meeting expectations compared to the states.

473
00:53:48,334 --> 00:53:50,559
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's accurate that the gap has not.

474
00:53:51,733 --> 00:53:52,233
[SPEAKER_04]: narrowed.

475
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:55,695
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think I think that's probably common across the board.

476
00:53:55,815 --> 00:54:02,357
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a bit troubling that we're also slightly lower than the state on average in some of these categories.

477
00:54:02,397 --> 00:54:05,119
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something we definitely need to look at and address.

478
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:14,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at some particular programs that might help us support and get through, get it, get it, make it more robust for sure.

479
00:54:15,143 --> 00:54:15,983
[SPEAKER_00]: No question about it.

480
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:17,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any Thank you.

481
00:54:17,203 --> 00:54:20,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any way that that specifically targets the subgroups or

482
00:54:21,552 --> 00:54:25,316
[SPEAKER_04]: not that you're aware of, or I'm just wondering, how are the subgroups targeted?

483
00:54:26,537 --> 00:54:33,465
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not necessarily targeting subgroups because we've just rolled out a curriculum.

484
00:54:33,965 --> 00:54:42,754
[SPEAKER_00]: The FOSS program is really meant to be a hands-on type of program that really has already incorporated many of the different

485
00:54:45,713 --> 00:54:54,115
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies that are meant to support learners diverse learners of all types, including how the materials are made and how you can use them.

486
00:54:54,476 --> 00:54:57,637
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the reasons that we thought it was a clear strength of the program.

487
00:54:58,037 --> 00:55:00,677
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to have to look a bit more deep more deeply.

488
00:55:01,258 --> 00:55:01,718
[SPEAKER_00]: And as

489
00:55:05,147 --> 00:55:23,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham has pointed out, we should probably look a little bit more deeply at the professional development from the program itself to see what they are what what they are offering at this point to be able to bring that forward again with with some, you know, with some robust funding I'm sure they're very open to professional development I think it's a.

490
00:55:25,918 --> 00:55:27,659
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really powerful program.

491
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:31,961
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly has a research base that is solid.

492
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:41,626
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not for lack of finding something, but we definitely want to target it and keep it with the materials that we have because we know they're good.

493
00:55:43,027 --> 00:55:45,228
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of going in and finding out what that is.

494
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:55,650
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will bring that, you know, we'll bring that question, pose it to the, to the FOSS group, and find out what solutions we can get.

495
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:56,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

496
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:57,050
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.

497
00:55:59,211 --> 00:56:00,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you very much.

498
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:09,593
[SPEAKER_13]: I would just want to say thank you again, Mr. Cieri for your leadership in science, and for the work that you're doing.

499
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:13,749
[SPEAKER_13]: with us on the district side.

500
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:24,218
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd like to take this opportunity to invite Dr. Chiesa on up to come in present to us on English language arts.

501
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:27,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Three through 12 of what's happening in the district.

502
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:27,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

503
00:56:32,344 --> 00:56:33,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everybody.

504
00:56:35,608 --> 00:56:40,634
[SPEAKER_01]: can't see all the slides because I forgot my glasses and they fog up, but I have them in front of me.

505
00:56:40,654 --> 00:56:43,297
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully I will be on the same slide as you.

506
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:49,985
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to start with the slide that talks about our student growth percentile for ELA.

507
00:56:50,806 --> 00:56:54,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you notice on that slide, when it appears.

508
00:57:02,327 --> 00:57:20,556
[SPEAKER_01]: I can begin speaking if you prefer, but at all grade levels, you'll see on that slide that English Language Arts MCAS exceeded state average compared to the state's SGP percentile, some grades more significantly than others, but we are growing.

509
00:57:21,617 --> 00:57:24,538
[SPEAKER_01]: At every grade level, there was significant growth.

510
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,800
[SPEAKER_01]: The next slide's just giving you an overview of how

511
00:57:30,317 --> 00:57:42,765
[SPEAKER_01]: We did grades three through 10 in English Language Arts, and you'll notice this represents the exceeding and meeting performance levels in four out of, sorry, this represents the exceeding and meeting performance levels.

512
00:57:43,625 --> 00:57:49,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And in four out of the seven grade levels, the district exceeded and or met the state in the combined performance levels.

513
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:55,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, steady progress was seen as they moved throughout the grades.

514
00:57:57,387 --> 00:58:06,612
[SPEAKER_01]: As we continue on in the slide deck, we will see that 53% of our third graders in Medford received a combined exceeding and meeting expectations performance level.

515
00:58:07,232 --> 00:58:09,733
[SPEAKER_01]: This exceeded the state average by three percentage points.

516
00:58:10,334 --> 00:58:21,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I highlight this for you because back in 2019, if you recall, Medford third graders underperformed the state by 13 percentage points in this performance level.

517
00:58:21,579 --> 00:58:26,682
[SPEAKER_01]: So this group is exceeding the state by three percentage points where the last time the test was

518
00:58:27,408 --> 00:58:31,089
[SPEAKER_01]: taken by third grade students, we were below.

519
00:58:32,449 --> 00:58:40,571
[SPEAKER_01]: At the fourth grade level, the district met the state's exceeding and meeting expectations performance level at 49%.

520
00:58:45,573 --> 00:58:53,915
[SPEAKER_01]: As we move to fifth grade, for the first time since the next generation ELA MCAS arrived,

521
00:58:54,557 --> 00:58:58,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifth graders met the state's combined exceeding and meeting expectations level.

522
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:03,643
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, we've always been a bit behind the state in other years.

523
00:59:05,424 --> 00:59:15,011
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing to point out is that the fifth grade group is the group where two years ago, they fell below the state average by that 13 percentage.

524
00:59:15,211 --> 00:59:20,975
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that they were on par is something to highlight, whereas when they

525
00:59:21,796 --> 00:59:26,118
[SPEAKER_01]: took this test back in third grade, they fell 11 percentage points below.

526
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:28,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, some of the cohort has changed.

527
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:31,621
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some mobility, but just to give you a sense.

528
00:59:33,582 --> 00:59:36,744
[SPEAKER_01]: The next slide talks about action items related to elementary.

529
00:59:37,124 --> 00:59:46,629
[SPEAKER_01]: As you've heard my colleagues mention, we have now implemented NWEA MAP growth, which is a diagnostic assessment that's going to allow us to support the students.

530
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:48,530
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to let us see in ELA

531
00:59:49,342 --> 01:00:10,520
[SPEAKER_01]: where our students are struggling, where they need some additional support, whether it's informational text, whether it's literary text, whether it's inferencing, it's going to really drill down at all grade levels, where we can hone in on making some shifts to make sure that we are meeting the needs of the students.

532
01:00:11,721 --> 01:00:15,925
[SPEAKER_01]: We will continue with grade level meetings with teachers and administrators to review data points.

533
01:00:17,183 --> 01:00:21,785
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, we've implemented several new materials to support literacy.

534
01:00:22,606 --> 01:00:29,129
[SPEAKER_01]: The ECRI, Enhanced Core Reading Instruction, is something that is being fully implemented at the primary grades, K through two.

535
01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:35,632
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should see the effects of that as the students enter grade three and beyond.

536
01:00:36,793 --> 01:00:40,375
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have incorporated Nuzella at the elementary levels.

537
01:00:41,175 --> 01:00:44,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Nuzella is going to foster a variety of literacy skills.

538
01:00:45,218 --> 01:00:50,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to give the students those pieces at their text complexity level.

539
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:56,381
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've continued as you read through refining the wind block.

540
01:00:56,941 --> 01:01:02,383
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, we are in the process of working on a reading committee to select a new literacy program.

541
01:01:03,263 --> 01:01:08,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've made some adjustments to our pacing guides because one of the struggles with the ELA MCAS is that

542
01:01:09,992 --> 01:01:14,555
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a variety of different essay tasks that the students are given.

543
01:01:14,695 --> 01:01:17,397
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are given narrative assignments.

544
01:01:17,817 --> 01:01:19,739
[SPEAKER_01]: They are given analytical assignments.

545
01:01:19,819 --> 01:01:30,386
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed to shift some writing, some sequencing in the writing to make sure that students were exposed to certain types of writing genres prior to taking the test.

546
01:01:32,187 --> 01:01:39,252
[SPEAKER_01]: If I move on to middle school, once again, for the first time since taking this,

547
01:01:40,194 --> 01:01:47,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Next generation MCAS test, the sixth graders were able to be on par with the state's exceeding and meeting expectations level.

548
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:55,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you recall back in 2019, our sixth graders fell 15 percentage points below the state.

549
01:01:55,125 --> 01:01:59,548
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did wanna highlight the fact that we are on par with the state for 2021.

550
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:09,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventh grade was, we fell seven percentage points below the state average in the exceeding and meeting expectations performance level.

551
01:02:10,131 --> 01:02:17,615
[SPEAKER_01]: We did exceed the SGP, the state's SGP, but we were below the state average in grade seven.

552
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:22,157
[SPEAKER_01]: And in grade eight, which is the next slide.

553
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:32,442
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the eighth grade, 38% of the district's eighth graders received a combined performance level.

554
01:02:32,522 --> 01:02:34,723
[SPEAKER_01]: They fell two percentage points below the state

555
01:02:35,569 --> 01:02:39,130
[SPEAKER_01]: But back in 2019, they were significantly below the state as well.

556
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:48,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Their mean SGP, and I know member Graham brought this up for eighth grade with math, the mean SGP for ELA was similarly higher than the state.

557
01:02:48,914 --> 01:02:50,614
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 10 points higher than the state.

558
01:02:51,015 --> 01:02:57,857
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see a lot of growth with that eighth grade cohort, both in math apparently, and certainly in English language arts.

559
01:02:58,557 --> 01:03:03,539
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're growing as they try to attain the state level.

560
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:16,184
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at action items from middle school, we will once again see the use of NWEA map growth, which is really gonna allow us to have a good handle on students' ability.

561
01:03:16,384 --> 01:03:19,366
[SPEAKER_01]: It does give us a MCAS predictor as well.

562
01:03:19,907 --> 01:03:27,973
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at this, we're gonna be able to tell, it's going to be able to predict where students might fall when they take the MCAS.

563
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,152
[SPEAKER_01]: We do do a lot of professional development devoted to data analysis.

564
01:03:33,113 --> 01:03:44,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Each middle school teacher is gonna get, receives a data drive with their information, particular to their class, particular to their students from both previous years, as well as their current students.

565
01:03:45,683 --> 01:03:50,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also added, I'm jumping through the bullets, just trying to be sensitive to time.

566
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:55,070
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't read each one for you, but a few other things to note is,

567
01:03:55,637 --> 01:03:59,419
[SPEAKER_01]: we've definitely put in a lot of additional literacy materials.

568
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:07,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Grade six, for example, where we did see them attaining state average, which is quite good compared to where they were in years past.

569
01:04:08,403 --> 01:04:16,427
[SPEAKER_01]: One shift that we did make was we removed a novel and added in several different excerpts instead.

570
01:04:16,628 --> 01:04:25,372
[SPEAKER_01]: And by doing that, we were able to have the students exposed to a few other genres of writing and having one, you know, we certainly taught

571
01:04:26,018 --> 01:04:27,058
[SPEAKER_01]: novels in sixth grade.

572
01:04:27,098 --> 01:04:31,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say we didn't because we did, but we had, I believe, three or four.

573
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:36,241
[SPEAKER_01]: We took one away and then added in excerpts and short stories to support that particular unit.

574
01:04:36,761 --> 01:04:43,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, that really aligned with one of our goals, which is to bring more diversity and more inclusivity to the curriculum.

575
01:04:43,743 --> 01:04:49,444
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by adding in short stories and excerpts in place of one novel, we were able to do that.

576
01:04:49,524 --> 01:04:51,545
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do see is we can work with that

577
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:59,682
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we can look at more authors' perspectives, more tone, we can have more practice in literary techniques.

578
01:05:00,362 --> 01:05:06,244
[SPEAKER_01]: We implemented Sora so that we could have students have more availability to a multitude of titles.

579
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:12,065
[SPEAKER_01]: We really pushed Newsella, which was very beneficial.

580
01:05:12,105 --> 01:05:16,686
[SPEAKER_01]: It gave us a lot of primary sources, gave us a lot of different support for the students.

581
01:05:16,906 --> 01:05:19,587
[SPEAKER_01]: As I went through the released test items,

582
01:05:20,153 --> 01:05:25,416
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see that there were so many different pieces of informational text, so many different types of genres.

583
01:05:25,456 --> 01:05:33,040
[SPEAKER_01]: So adding in these additional avenues towards literacy seemed to be beneficial on many levels.

584
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:42,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will continue to work with our special education and EL students, including the role of co-teaching as we continue to support the needs of all of our students.

585
01:05:44,366 --> 01:05:48,268
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, we have the 10th grade English Language Arts MCAS results.

586
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:54,675
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 61% of Medford's 10th graders achieving and exceeding and meeting expectations performance level.

587
01:05:55,556 --> 01:05:59,219
[SPEAKER_01]: The mean SGP for 10th graders remained above the state average.

588
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:05,684
[SPEAKER_01]: And the action items are very somewhat similar to those of middle school.

589
01:06:06,165 --> 01:06:11,609
[SPEAKER_01]: We did make sure that map growth is available for our ninth and 10th graders, so we can have some more data.

590
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:18,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I also failed to mention that middle school this year, we did, we, thanks to your support,

591
01:06:18,625 --> 01:06:22,606
[SPEAKER_01]: We did add in the literacy specialist, so we're happy to have those back at the middle school.

592
01:06:23,967 --> 01:06:28,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the high school, we are going to do a lot of PD devoted to data analysis.

593
01:06:29,468 --> 01:06:35,850
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I did notice on the 10th grade English MCAS release items, there's a lot of passages.

594
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:46,333
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe just on test session one that was available, we had eight different reading passages that the students had for that one test session, which was available.

595
01:06:46,819 --> 01:06:51,764
[SPEAKER_01]: it's limited in what we can see, but we saw that there were eight passages so stamina needs to be looked at as well.

596
01:06:52,745 --> 01:07:02,413
[SPEAKER_01]: As we as we go through this, particularly given that you know they were home for part of the time to so stamina becomes an issue on many levels and certainly with a passages.

597
01:07:03,054 --> 01:07:12,823
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have some stamina to to get through the text and we're going to continue our work adding in more literacy materials to make sure that we have.

598
01:07:13,537 --> 01:07:18,940
[SPEAKER_01]: many different authors using Sora, using Moosella, and continuing that work as well.

599
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:30,165
[SPEAKER_01]: We've really tried to target our MCAS classes and our literacy challenge classes to make sure that the correct students are in there, the ones that would need that tier two support in ELA.

600
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,587
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look forward, those are minis or mini electives.

601
01:07:34,448 --> 01:07:39,350
[SPEAKER_01]: So working with Mr. DeLevo, we were able to populate those appropriately for the students in need.

602
01:07:41,765 --> 01:07:44,506
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm more than happy to answer questions.

603
01:07:45,827 --> 01:07:46,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

604
01:07:46,547 --> 01:07:48,829
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

605
01:07:49,289 --> 01:07:49,709
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

606
01:07:49,729 --> 01:07:59,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the I always find the grade level scores to be this like, like suspension of reality.

607
01:08:00,016 --> 01:08:03,999
[SPEAKER_08]: that the 13% below two years ago, those are the seventh graders.

608
01:08:04,459 --> 01:08:09,862
[SPEAKER_08]: The fifth graders who are 13% below two years ago, those are the seventh graders and they're still below.

609
01:08:09,882 --> 01:08:23,850
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do like very much that the growth percentages or percentile shows that while they were significantly below, behind or whatever the right word is, it's shrinking.

610
01:08:24,010 --> 01:08:25,891
[SPEAKER_08]: So that the middle school staff are,

611
01:08:28,334 --> 01:08:39,098
[SPEAKER_08]: bringing the kids up, and you know that the, the, you know, while the seventh grade scores are just glancing at the chart around seven or 8% below the state average.

612
01:08:43,570 --> 01:08:46,852
[SPEAKER_08]: just leftover from having been so far below is how I read it.

613
01:08:47,032 --> 01:08:47,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Possibly.

614
01:08:48,372 --> 01:08:59,078
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that that's important to recognize that these are, you know, the current fifth graders are a group of students that are not the same group of students that were last year's fifth graders.

615
01:08:59,238 --> 01:09:03,200
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's so weird that we always look at how's the fifth grade doing every year

616
01:09:04,618 --> 01:09:09,779
[SPEAKER_08]: But every year it's a different group of kids and there's nothing like, every kid is different.

617
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:14,800
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, I just think it's a weird thing where we compare year after year, our grade.

618
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:22,302
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand from a teaching perspective, there's something to learn, but I just think that's strange.

619
01:09:23,122 --> 01:09:28,723
[SPEAKER_08]: You mentioned that the data drives with their students are handed to the teachers at the beginning of the year, I assume?

620
01:09:29,313 --> 01:09:39,439
[SPEAKER_01]: In the beginning of the year, once the items can be no longer embargoed, we use department meetings to zone in on a few different pieces.

621
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:46,524
[SPEAKER_01]: And also conferences with teachers that we evaluate, we can drill down, look at that data as well.

622
01:09:46,884 --> 01:09:53,368
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can have those conversations about, you know, this is where your class struggled, let's say last year, we had the MCAS and

623
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:57,663
[SPEAKER_01]: and these are areas shifts we're gonna make, and these are the students coming to you.

624
01:09:57,703 --> 01:10:05,950
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of this work, yes, is given to the teachers and through department meetings, as well as some evaluation meetings as well.

625
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:22,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, my other question about that makes me sad because I know the answer now, but I mean, so one of my main beefs, and I'm not alone on the MCAS, is if you could tell me that before school opened, a teacher would get a,

626
01:10:24,103 --> 01:10:35,454
[SPEAKER_08]: document or set of documents says here's johnny here Susie and here's where their weaknesses are based on their last year's m cast data, so you know, so we can try and lift them up.

627
01:10:37,075 --> 01:10:39,618
[SPEAKER_08]: That would almost make me be okay with them.

628
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:41,179
[SPEAKER_08]: But we don't do that.

629
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:48,739
[SPEAKER_08]: that the teacher just gets the student and then maybe sub partway through the year, the teacher finds out how Susie and Johnny are doing.

630
01:10:49,139 --> 01:10:51,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what the teacher already knows how Susie and Johnny are doing.

631
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,620
[SPEAKER_08]: They're in the teacher's class.

632
01:10:54,760 --> 01:11:07,523
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just, I'm continually disappointed that we get data on the individual student and we don't give it to the new teachers to make and take specific action on that student.

633
01:11:07,823 --> 01:11:10,083
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just talk about a grade level as if,

634
01:11:11,453 --> 01:11:22,961
[SPEAKER_08]: know, is if that helps, you know, the seventh graders, these individual seventh graders who were in the fifth grade, and where we got the really unattractive 13% below state.

635
01:11:24,662 --> 01:11:29,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Do each of those teachers know where those individual students were falling behind?

636
01:11:30,646 --> 01:11:40,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, explicitly, specifically, not like your general class has a challenge around this, what we've done in the past, obviously, we didn't do it last year, because

637
01:11:40,574 --> 01:11:48,339
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have a test, but generally what we do do is the teacher looks at the students they had, but also the students they have.

638
01:11:49,560 --> 01:12:03,128
[SPEAKER_01]: So the seventh graders that are now eighth graders, my English language arts teachers will look at those scores of their current students to see where the students were successful and to see where they struggled.

639
01:12:04,169 --> 01:12:08,051
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will have data for their current students

640
01:12:09,342 --> 01:12:15,986
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they will not just have data for the sake of having data, we will engage in, what do we do with this data?

641
01:12:17,126 --> 01:12:23,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the co, is this, is Johnny, or whatever your example is, is he struggling in essay writing?

642
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,071
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, was his writing score low?

643
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:34,896
[SPEAKER_01]: That eighth grade teachers will be able to look at that data so that they can make some good shifts, the ones I talked about in the action items, for those particular students.

644
01:12:34,956 --> 01:12:36,197
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will have,

645
01:12:37,298 --> 01:12:39,659
[SPEAKER_01]: my English teachers will have that information.

646
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:41,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's great.

647
01:12:41,701 --> 01:12:43,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's the data drives.

648
01:12:43,502 --> 01:12:48,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually in the data drive, sometimes it just depends on modality in which we do it, but they will have that, so they know.

649
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:59,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, and then I guess my, just from a pragmatic perspective, is there enough time for teachers to do that work in the current schedule?

650
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:04,573
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a partnership with the principals and with the directors.

651
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:08,782
[SPEAKER_01]: There are times where there is time.

652
01:13:09,142 --> 01:13:10,162
[SPEAKER_01]: There's never enough time.

653
01:13:10,663 --> 01:13:18,067
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that the principals and the directors have done a good job making time for more data dives.

654
01:13:18,868 --> 01:13:28,593
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we try to use the time as efficiently as we can and not get caught up in data that maybe isn't as critical.

655
01:13:29,274 --> 01:13:30,374
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of data.

656
01:13:30,494 --> 01:13:32,876
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really kind of zone in on that.

657
01:13:32,956 --> 01:13:34,977
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, growth is really important.

658
01:13:35,401 --> 01:13:39,942
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm looking at one thing I do like teachers to look at is, what is the growth?

659
01:13:40,402 --> 01:13:44,263
[SPEAKER_01]: If this child grew significantly, well, you know, something's clicking.

660
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:46,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's continue with that.

661
01:13:46,084 --> 01:13:46,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what happened.

662
01:13:47,324 --> 01:13:50,144
[SPEAKER_01]: If the child's plateauing, you know, what are we gonna do?

663
01:13:50,164 --> 01:13:56,366
[SPEAKER_01]: And the literacy specialist, the middle school level, and of course the elementary will be able to also weigh in on that.

664
01:13:57,366 --> 01:13:58,266
[SPEAKER_08]: If that answers your question.

665
01:13:58,286 --> 01:13:59,407
[SPEAKER_08]: It does, yes, thank you.

666
01:13:59,547 --> 01:14:00,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

667
01:14:01,907 --> 01:14:02,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any other questions?

668
01:14:04,528 --> 01:14:05,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Member McLaughlin?

669
01:14:06,462 --> 01:14:06,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

670
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:08,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Keita.

671
01:14:08,364 --> 01:14:08,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

672
01:14:08,804 --> 01:14:09,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate your work.

673
01:14:10,886 --> 01:14:19,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a few questions when you were talking about the diversity and inclusivity in the curriculum and the data analysis.

674
01:14:19,353 --> 01:14:32,685
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering about how we're comparing, once again, sort of curriculum for students with disabilities around these data dives, especially when we have classrooms that have

675
01:14:33,546 --> 01:14:52,852
[SPEAKER_04]: three grade levels in one classroom for some of our program driven classrooms and whether there's differentiation of grade level material for the curriculums and I guess whether in fact all of the teachers are using the same curriculum.

676
01:14:54,332 --> 01:14:59,194
[SPEAKER_01]: All the teachers have access to the same curriculum and they have access to their specific grade levels.

677
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:11,403
[SPEAKER_01]: teacher that's teaching sixth, seventh, and eighth grade, let's say in one classroom, a small group setting, those teachers do have access to all of our curriculum, all of the curriculum.

678
01:15:11,503 --> 01:15:12,823
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all of our curriculum, right?

679
01:15:12,843 --> 01:15:13,844
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the entire district.

680
01:15:14,504 --> 01:15:15,905
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, access is there.

681
01:15:17,185 --> 01:15:25,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Special education teachers, for example, join my department meetings every other month, so they can be with their coordinator one month and then be with,

682
01:15:27,703 --> 01:15:30,605
[SPEAKER_01]: with my meetings on an alternating month as well.

683
01:15:32,026 --> 01:15:42,615
[SPEAKER_01]: All access to all these materials to Newsella and everything else, I've made certain that all teachers have access to those accounts so that we're all sharing in that.

684
01:15:44,476 --> 01:15:48,639
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and do we know whether they're being used across all classrooms or?

685
01:15:48,780 --> 01:15:49,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we run a report.

686
01:15:50,301 --> 01:15:51,742
[SPEAKER_01]: For Newsella, we run a report.

687
01:15:51,802 --> 01:15:51,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

688
01:15:53,847 --> 01:16:04,134
[SPEAKER_01]: It varies, I haven't run a report yet as we've been acclimating to a lot of different things and the map growth has been an acclimation as well, but I'm happy to look at that data as well.

689
01:16:04,934 --> 01:16:06,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and is there any, thank you, I appreciate that.

690
01:16:07,016 --> 01:16:15,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really important to know for families as well and to know sort of if we're comparing apples to apples here and if we're not.

691
01:16:16,522 --> 01:16:22,446
[SPEAKER_04]: And is there differentiation as far as you know of the grade level material for access?

692
01:16:23,493 --> 01:16:35,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do we do for remediation in these issues, so I know that you're doing these great data dives into this material where you're saying you can go into a classroom and say here's what's working in this classroom yeah and do more of this.

693
01:16:35,264 --> 01:16:41,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's what's not working in this classroom here's what the shifts are that we can make is that happening in these substantially separate.

694
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,258
[SPEAKER_04]: classroom settings, and if so, how?

695
01:16:44,478 --> 01:16:48,340
[SPEAKER_01]: If those teachers are coming, I believe with the principals, they're doing more with that.

696
01:16:48,521 --> 01:17:05,250
[SPEAKER_01]: When the teachers attend my English meetings, I try to line it up so that that data dive is something that includes, that would have the data dive meeting that maybe I initiate, you know, if we're all looking at it, let's say in October, I try to make it so that that meeting is where everybody is at so that they can engage in it.

697
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:10,713
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, I make sure that everybody is aware of the data so that they can push forward

698
01:17:11,131 --> 01:17:17,095
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely differentiation is huge and how we're teaching the text, making sure that all the different strategies are being used.

699
01:17:17,115 --> 01:17:23,881
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we could have a student on an IEP for a nonverbal learning disorder, let's say, and they're just not making pictures in their mind.

700
01:17:23,901 --> 01:17:31,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So are we doing enough in the classroom, whether it's special education, subseparate classroom, or general education classroom, to make pictures of that text in our mind?

701
01:17:31,306 --> 01:17:32,547
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we doing to get them there?

702
01:17:33,476 --> 01:17:47,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there still decoding issues and how does our literacy specialists work as well, always talking with the English teachers to make sure that we're building we're not being redundant but we're building on on each other skills are on what what was taught.

703
01:17:48,435 --> 01:17:48,975
[SPEAKER_04]: That's helpful.

704
01:17:48,995 --> 01:17:51,298
[SPEAKER_04]: So then that humanities teachers are working with.

705
01:17:52,094 --> 01:18:03,058
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, special education teachers that are teaching three different levels, say they're teaching sixth, seventh, and eighth, a humanities English teacher would be working with them, content teacher would be working with them around the curriculum.

706
01:18:03,138 --> 01:18:21,185
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also all have access to our pacing guides as well, so that they can see, you know, everyone's going to go at their own pace, but they have access to those materials to make sure, yeah, we try to make sure we're as inclusive as possible and making sure that we're not, that it's going at the proper pace for each child, but that the differentiation is there.

707
01:18:21,648 --> 01:18:24,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So that the skills, the nice thing with English is it's skill based.

708
01:18:24,912 --> 01:18:29,678
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can achieve those skills in different ways with different types of texts.

709
01:18:30,699 --> 01:18:34,484
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that works well and that we really take to heart.

710
01:18:34,504 --> 01:18:36,146
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things I love about New Zealand.

711
01:18:36,166 --> 01:18:39,971
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how New Zealand first came to us because it takes a piece.

712
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:45,352
[SPEAKER_01]: and it changes the complexity based on the lexile levels of the child.

713
01:18:45,573 --> 01:18:50,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be great if we could have data on how many of the teachers are actually utilizing the curriculum.

714
01:18:50,839 --> 01:18:51,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I will get that for you.

715
01:18:51,539 --> 01:18:51,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

716
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

717
01:18:56,903 --> 01:18:57,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Just one more question.

718
01:18:58,004 --> 01:18:59,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Just one very quick.

719
01:18:59,385 --> 01:18:59,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

720
01:18:59,945 --> 01:19:00,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

721
01:19:00,606 --> 01:19:02,527
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually not specific to this one.

722
01:19:03,668 --> 01:19:09,653
[SPEAKER_08]: But is it, I know that this is a, this document is an output from the state, correct?

723
01:19:09,713 --> 01:19:12,495
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not, is this ours or is this?

724
01:19:13,476 --> 01:19:15,538
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our document, correct, Dr. Vincent?

725
01:19:15,978 --> 01:19:23,144
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, you know, like, I think I asked this a couple of times in the past, but, you know, when we look at percentages between us and the state,

726
01:19:25,244 --> 01:19:30,550
[SPEAKER_08]: You know if there's 500 students and where one percentage point above the state.

727
01:19:32,071 --> 01:19:38,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we're just there's no significant difference when there's three students or 24 students and we're five.

728
01:19:39,574 --> 01:19:41,995
[SPEAKER_08]: percentages above the state, that's huge.

729
01:19:43,436 --> 01:19:49,178
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm happy to do this on my own, but I don't wanna type all this over into Excel myself.

730
01:19:50,099 --> 01:19:53,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess my question is, can this be sent to us in a document where we can do that?

731
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there really should be a column here.

732
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:05,746
[SPEAKER_08]: 24 Asian students, five percentage points below the state scaled, or five points below the state scaled score in grade four.

733
01:20:05,846 --> 01:20:07,727
[SPEAKER_08]: But 24 is a small number of students.

734
01:20:09,162 --> 01:20:17,168
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, and some of these other numbers are much bigger and have, you know, whatever kinds of differences in their numbers.

735
01:20:18,028 --> 01:20:23,212
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just, when you look at these differences, they don't mean anything.

736
01:20:24,333 --> 01:20:29,517
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't, they have to be in context to the number of students and

737
01:20:30,903 --> 01:20:39,530
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think these are all great to have, but the Latino Hispanic fifth graders are nine percentage points above state, but there's only 32 people in that group.

738
01:20:41,132 --> 01:20:42,953
[SPEAKER_08]: So is that significant or not?

739
01:20:43,774 --> 01:20:45,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Like statistically significant.

740
01:20:45,696 --> 01:20:54,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, cause I don't want to get all worried and upset about differences that are not statistically significant based on the number of students in the group.

741
01:20:55,444 --> 01:20:57,306
[SPEAKER_08]: And I never see that column here.

742
01:20:58,633 --> 01:21:04,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Several years ago, we added the number of students in there, but I hear you want something more than that, correct?

743
01:21:04,977 --> 01:21:05,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

744
01:21:06,699 --> 01:21:19,548
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can use the number of students to tell you whether or not, because, I mean, being five points above something when there's 1,000 people in a group versus five points above when there's five people in a group is not the same thing.

745
01:21:20,768 --> 01:21:22,330
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm happy to do it myself.

746
01:21:22,490 --> 01:21:26,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just wondering, can we get these sent to us in a form where we can do it ourselves in Excel?

747
01:21:31,661 --> 01:21:34,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Not as a PDM, thank you, that's all I want.

748
01:21:34,682 --> 01:21:36,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I also ask another question to the chair?

749
01:21:37,284 --> 01:21:39,625
[SPEAKER_12]: Very quickly, Melanie, please.

750
01:21:39,985 --> 01:21:40,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

751
01:21:41,706 --> 01:21:53,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I would also, if there are other curriculums that are being used at the English level, ELA level, such as unique learning or something like that, it would be really great to have a report on that data as well.

752
01:21:53,511 --> 01:21:58,093
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would make a motion that we include any additional curriculum

753
01:21:58,807 --> 01:22:07,263
[SPEAKER_04]: if we could in the reports that is outside of the scope of the, or not outside of the scope, outside of what is currently being reported on.

754
01:22:13,832 --> 01:22:14,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you say that again?

755
01:22:14,773 --> 01:22:15,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not following.

756
01:22:15,413 --> 01:22:21,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, the motion is that the report would include any curriculum that is outside of what is currently being reported on.

757
01:22:21,818 --> 01:22:33,147
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's any other curriculum that's in the school that's being used for ELA, for example, or for these others that are being used consistently across grade levels, that we would get a report on that curriculum as well.

758
01:22:34,565 --> 01:22:39,026
[SPEAKER_12]: But that would also seem to be a topic that could be taken up in the I didn't hear you.

759
01:22:39,247 --> 01:22:40,927
[SPEAKER_12]: It could be taken up in the curriculum.

760
01:22:40,987 --> 01:22:43,728
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's fine if you want to move it to the curriculum subcommittee meeting.

761
01:22:43,748 --> 01:22:48,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, if not right at the moment, but yeah, in the in the general meeting.

762
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:48,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

763
01:22:49,190 --> 01:22:49,450
Okay.

764
01:22:50,032 --> 01:22:51,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, just a suggestion.

765
01:22:51,592 --> 01:22:52,272
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

766
01:22:52,312 --> 01:22:53,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much, Dr. Hayes.

767
01:22:53,413 --> 01:22:56,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll withdraw the motion and I'll- Thank you.

768
01:22:56,613 --> 01:22:57,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

769
01:22:57,413 --> 01:23:02,234
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for all the teachers and- Member Vander Kloot?

770
01:23:02,494 --> 01:23:02,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

771
01:23:02,834 --> 01:23:04,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just ask one quick question?

772
01:23:06,455 --> 01:23:19,237
[SPEAKER_03]: For next year, is it possible that the department heads can get together and come up with a way that they're all going to display the same data so that when we're looking at charts between

773
01:23:19,857 --> 01:23:21,318
[SPEAKER_03]: English and math and science.

774
01:23:21,778 --> 01:23:33,186
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't all look different even though the I mean, the data's all there but just as you're traveling across documents, it's very difficult to retrain how you're looking at the charts.

775
01:23:34,087 --> 01:23:42,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Um and it it seems to be like a standardization would make it easier for the department heads and for all for anybody who's looking at the data.

776
01:23:42,572 --> 01:23:46,835
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if we could just think about that next year so that the reports are a little more consistent one

777
01:23:47,743 --> 01:23:50,525
[SPEAKER_03]: one subject matter to the next, that would be very helpful.

778
01:23:53,107 --> 01:23:54,928
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, we will reconvene in 10 minutes.

779
01:23:55,128 --> 01:23:58,071
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like a motion for adjournment, please.

780
01:23:58,151 --> 01:23:58,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

781
01:23:58,711 --> 01:23:59,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion for adjournment.
