    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=459.61s">stands</a>  one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=467.575s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, would you please call the roll?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=469.376s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=475.379s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=476.66s">Here.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=478.181s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=479.341s">Member</a>  Mustone, not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=481.803s">Member</a>  Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=482.803s">Here.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=483.904s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=485.125s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=485.845s">Mayor</a>  Lungo-Koehn, not here.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=489.823s">So</a>  with five present and two absent, we have a quorum and the meeting can proceed. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=498.914s">Madam</a>  Superintendent, if I could ask you now to take over.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=502.572s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=503.693s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=504.674s">This</a>  evening we're going to have an opportunity to look at our MCAS results. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=509.319s">We</a>  will have a slide presentation, and that presentation will begin with science. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=516.387s">Mr.</a>  Rocco Cieri our director of science will present the science <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=521.832s">information,</a>  followed by Miss Pfizer current who will present mathematics, and Dr Nicole keys who will be presenting for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=532.539s">So</a>  without much further ado, Dr cushion.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=538.04s">Good</a>  evening, thank you members of the committee and Dr. Edouard-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=542.764s">Prior</a>  to beginning, wanted to just give you a little bit of the pandemic induced shifts that occurred as a result. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=551.391s">Jesse</a>  made significant shifts regarding MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=555.414s">So</a>  Jesse allowed some assessments to be taken from home ELA and math grades three through eight and the science technology engineering exam grade five. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=565.262s">STE</a>  grade nine was only available as a paper based assessment, there was no computer based option. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=571.627s">Remote</a>  only high school students could opt out of the STE MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=579.072s">However</a>  you look at that, the students now will be required to take the chemistry STE exam. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=587.594s">So</a>  students in the freshman class take biology. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=590.995s">These</a>  students in the sophomore class will take STE. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=595.357s">And</a>  there are modified competency determinations for classes 21, which graduated 22 and 23. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=606.227s">One</a>  more quick slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=608.05s">This</a>  year, there were no accountability ratings for elementary and secondary education. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=614.258s">There</a>  were none at the school district or state level for accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=618.124s">And</a>  now actually Pfizer is going to go first.</p>

    <p>[Khan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=633.603s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=635.483s">Thank</a>  you, members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=638.624s">I</a>  would like to start off by looking at slide four. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=644.666s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, we have it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=649.167s">The</a>  mean SGPs for the grade levels are here for grade five. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=653.788s">It</a>  was 28.53 for grade six. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=655.169s">It</a>  was 23.85 for grade seven, 41.6. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=660.77s">For</a>  grade eight, 35.8, and for grade 10, it was 35.4. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=664.591s">In</a>  the report on page, and I can pull it up, there is a comparison between the state and the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=678.455s">It</a>  is on page 14.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=679.975s">On</a>  page what, Plaza?</p>

    <p>[Khan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=682.216s">On</a>  page 14. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=682.896s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=684.016s">If</a>  you would like to take a look.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=693.44s">on</a>  page 14 of the report.</p>

    <p>[Khan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=725.503s">never</a>  end. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=727.544s">Page</a>  14 of the MCAS mathematics report. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=732.405s">I</a>  would like to move on to the next slide, please, for the Mathematics 2021 MCAS action items. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=742.488s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=744.248s">The</a>  mathematics department is working on the following initiatives to bring greater coherence to mathematics instruction K through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=752.093s">In</a>  addition, the eventual adoption of a new elementary mathematics program promises to further prepare our students to engage in inquiry-based learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=761.079s">These</a>  actions will further ensure that our youngest learners will have greater access to advanced mathematics learning opportunities in high school and beyond. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=771.286s">The</a>  mathematics action items include using Envision's mathematics program in elementary K through five classrooms, with the exception of 22 classrooms using Bridges and Investigations III. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=786.075s">Bridges</a>  and investigations three are basically problem based inquiry based programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=792.938s">They</a>  are in line with the new pedagogy and they rank very high on ed reports and their experience in the surrounding districts has been excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=805.204s">Number</a>  two, selecting a new elementary math program with the elementary math program review committee <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=811.292s">We</a>  are anticipating that it'll be completed by March, April of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=817.682s">We'll</a>  make a decision and we will come to you with the findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=824.58s">Bullet</a>  three is using illustrative mathematics standard classes and big ideas and accelerated classes at the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=832.223s">This</a>  has been ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=834.063s">We</a>  are reorganizing middle school acceleration by teaching half of eighth grade standards in seventh grade and the other half in eighth grade, along with algebra one standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=845.127s">Whereas</a>  up until last year we were teaching seventh and eighth grade standards in seventh grade and teaching algebra one standards in eighth grade to the accelerated students, so that was two years worth of mathematics for the accelerated seventh grade students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=861.288s">And</a>  we felt that we are in line with Desi's recommendation by splitting the standards half and half into two years rather than finishing up two years worth of standards in one. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=876.555s">Moving</a>  on, on the next page, on the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=881.737s">are</a>  reviewing grade six through 12 pacing guides and modifying sequence if needed to keep a balance between spiral learning and improving student performance on MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=892.342s">Grades</a>  K through five will use program specific pacing guides for program assessment purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=899.005s">The</a>  reason is that we have 22 classrooms that are not using envisions 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=904.227s">So</a>  we need to be allowing the teachers to use it with full fidelity. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=910.85s">So</a>  we cannot use a district-wide pacing guide for our elementary math program right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=919.415s">Developing</a>  and updating the core syllabi for new and existing courses. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=925.198s">Extending</a>  the education opportunities for our 6th through 12th students in order to help them achieve their full potential through MPS 6th through 12th Equitable Math Pathways and Program Review Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=938.017s">Just</a>  like our elementary program review committee, we have been reviewing the secondary programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=944.045s">We</a>  have been contemplating many different pathways for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=949.012s">We</a>  want to make sure it's equitable to them because not all students can learn through algebra, geometry, algebra pathway. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=956.201s">There</a>  is, for example, an integrated pathway that combines algebra and geometry for three years, subsequently leading to the calculus path. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=967.164s">We</a>  will be looking at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=968.584s">In</a>  fact, we already are. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=970.704s">For</a>  the high school, for the middle school, we are looking at all our practices, for example, classroom participation rubric. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=977.246s">We</a>  are looking at student self-assessment of group work rubric, just to be sure that we are equitable when we are <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=986.991s">when</a>  we are teaching and learning our Medford community students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=994.878s">Providing</a>  additional resources to teachers to increase ability to teach more diverse elective courses at the MHS, MBTHS, and Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1004.946s">We</a>  are also looking at what other courses we can offer our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1009.831s">Exploring</a>  options for the electives category that will combine with having additional resources because most of the additional resources will be needed for these electives if chosen. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1024.623s">Shifting</a>  the focus of teaching and learning from procedural memorization to creative thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1029.848s">This</a>  has been the focus for last <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1032.855s">Two</a>  years pandemic had put a barrier to it, but this is really the gist of it that we want to shift from procedural memorization to creative thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1043.708s">We</a>  are developing a departmental vision and a mission statement with an emphasis on 21st century problem solving skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1050.674s">We</a>  are researching nationwide best mathematical practices and trends to incorporate in our classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1057.179s">We</a>  have been promoting and will continue to promote inquiry based teaching and learning through professional development of our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1066.961s">and</a>  incorporating data-driven strategies using the data from our newly acquired NWEA Map Growth so that we can minimize learning loss due to COVID-19 and that we can also learn from this adaptive assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1086.277s">Those</a>  were the action items for mathematics for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1091.602s">And</a>  then now I'll move on to the highlights of the MCAS. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1096.842s">So</a>  the high school grade 10 data slightly lagged behind the state in standards and domains by a two to 10 point differential in all categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1105.326s">In</a>  the student growth percentile category, the high school was behind the state by 1.1 percentile. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1111.47s">Given</a>  the extreme unusual conditions of the pandemic, we realized that we will continue to make consistent progress towards our goal of increased outcomes for all learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1121.835s">The</a>  following data points are highlights from grades three through eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1126.077s">Grade</a>  8 at Andrews Middle School data closely matched with the state's grade level data at 39% versus state's 41%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1134.639s">Given</a>  the lower participation rate of 83% versus state's 93%, grade 8 at Andrews Middle School and McGlynn Middle School student growth percentile exceeded the state by 5.8%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1146.481s">Percentile</a>  points versus the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1151.546s">Grade</a>  seven at McGlynn Middle School exceeding expectations close closely matched with the state's grade level data at 5% versus state 6% and they had similar participation rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1163.275s">Grade</a>  seven at Andrews Middle School and McGlynn Middle School student growth percentile exceeded the state by 8.4 percentile points versus the state <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1173.062s">Grade</a>  six at Andrews Middle School, exceeding expectations and meeting expectations categories total 39% versus states 34%, which is notably higher than the states exceeding and meeting expectations categories put together, given the lower participation rate at Andrews of 66% versus states 95%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1196.998s">On</a>  slide eight, we continue on. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1200.419s">Grade</a>  three at Mississippi Elementary School exceeding expectations is on par with the state at 5% despite a lower percentage rate than the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1210.201s">Grade</a>  three at Roberts Elementary meeting expectations is on par with the state at 28% despite a lower participation rate than the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1218.943s">Grade</a>  three at McGlynn Elementary School exceeding and meeting expectations categories total 39% versus state's 33%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1226.725s">you</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1229.192s">Grade</a>  five at Brooks Elementary School, exceeding expectations and meeting expectations categories total 42% versus states 33%, which is significantly higher than the state's exceeding and meeting expectations categories put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1244.76s">Grade</a>  five at Brooks Elementary School, SGP is on par with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1249.002s">Grade</a>  four at Brooks Elementary School, exceeding expectations and meeting expectations categories total 45% versus states 33%. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1258.087s">and</a>  that is significantly higher than the state's two categories put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1262.349s">I</a>  have put the rest of the data in the tables in the report that was presented to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1274.336s">I</a>  am not sure, would we like to take questions now or towards the end? <a href="https://youtu.be/Sog9mTxuN90&t=1280.26s">Please</a>  advise.</p>
