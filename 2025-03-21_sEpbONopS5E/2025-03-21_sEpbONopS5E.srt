00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:57,684

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

00:00:58,744 --> 00:01:11,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And the paper table last week relative to the shape of Brooks estate.

00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:11,727
[SPEAKER_07]: So very good.

28
00:01:11,747 --> 00:01:14,488
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion for suspension of the rules to take, uh,

29
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:17,703
[SPEAKER_07]: One paper out of order and one off the table.

30
00:01:17,783 --> 00:01:18,564
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

31
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:19,845
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

32
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:22,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Carries.

33
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:24,971
[SPEAKER_07]: 15-691, communication from the Mayor.

34
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:33,800
[SPEAKER_07]: October 1st, 2015, Council President, Medford City Council, from Mayor Michael J. McGlynn, home rule petition regarding rights upon

35
00:01:34,585 --> 00:01:45,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend your Honorable Body approve the attached Home Rule petition to be sent to the General Court regarding the use of Wright's Pond.

36
00:01:46,553 --> 00:02:03,884
[SPEAKER_07]: This Home Rule petition has been drafted by the City Solicitor after the completion of historical research on Wright's Pond that included a title search, reference to earlier operations by past Medford City Solicitors, the assistance of State Representative Paul J. Donato, in consultation with

37
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:07,873
[SPEAKER_07]: House Council of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

38
00:02:08,414 --> 00:02:28,526
[SPEAKER_07]: The approval of this home rule petition by the General Court would remove any ambiguity and establish with finality and clarity that the use of the beach at Wright's Pond and the area that services the beach can be restricted and limited to residents of Medford and their invitees to the exclusion of others.

39
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:32,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Respectfully submitted, Michael J. McGlynn, Mayor.

40
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:48,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, the enclosure is an act of establishing the city of Medford to use certain land for any municipal purpose, be it enacted, et cetera, as far as follows, notwithstanding any law regulation or ordinance.

41
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:53,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, move to waive the reading and have the solicitor give us a brief synopsis of the language.

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good on that motion.

43
00:02:55,962 --> 00:02:56,462
[SPEAKER_07]: All in favor.

44
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:57,362
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed.

45
00:02:58,023 --> 00:02:59,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Solicitor.

46
00:03:01,385 --> 00:03:01,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

47
00:03:02,602 --> 00:03:04,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening Mr. President and members of the council.

48
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,047
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Mark Rumley.

49
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,689
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the city solicitor.

50
00:03:07,749 --> 00:03:10,572
[SPEAKER_13]: I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

51
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:13,917
[SPEAKER_13]: I thank you for taking this paper tonight.

52
00:03:13,957 --> 00:03:19,364
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a proposed home rule petition and I'll give you a quick background on the

53
00:03:20,038 --> 00:03:23,081
[SPEAKER_13]: facts that gave rise to the need for this home loan petition.

54
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:43,220
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a person that called the mayor's office, which was referred to my office, late July or early August, who lives out of Medford, not a resident of Medford, and wanted to know why they could not utilize Wright's Pond, because the city has restricted it to residents only, historically.

55
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:48,370
[SPEAKER_13]: So I said that I would do research on the issue, and I did so.

56
00:03:48,871 --> 00:03:53,216
[SPEAKER_13]: And I saw the various laws that had been passed in the past on this.

57
00:03:54,932 --> 00:04:02,694
[SPEAKER_13]: And I focused in on an opinion written by Dan Riley in 1974, city solicitor Daniel Riley.

58
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:22,418
[SPEAKER_13]: And Mr. Riley said that because the property was deeded or transferred to the city from the state for park purposes, that it could not be restricted just to residents only, that the use of it had to be open to residents from other cities and towns because park land

59
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:27,268
[SPEAKER_13]: under the Massachusetts Constitution has a certain status, and it must be open.

60
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:51,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, after the city solicitor's opinion in 74, there was an effort to pass a special law, a session law, a home rule petition, which would allow Medford to restrict the use of Wright's Pond, at least the beach area and the bathhouse and the parking area to residents only.

61
00:04:52,512 --> 00:05:01,079
[SPEAKER_13]: But the way that was versed, it said that the state gave the city the ability to use parkland in this fashion.

62
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,581
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's ambiguous.

63
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:12,908
[SPEAKER_13]: And it certainly would indicate from the declarative parkland that this would have to be open to all of the residents of other cities and towns.

64
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:18,412
[SPEAKER_13]: So this matter came up before the park commission at the very end of the summer.

65
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:21,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and, uh, this was described to them.

66
00:05:21,998 --> 00:05:24,180
[SPEAKER_13]: and also the matter was made known to the mayor.

67
00:05:24,841 --> 00:05:34,491
[SPEAKER_13]: And I had an extensive discussion with James Kennedy, who was the House Counsel at the House of Representatives in Boston, State House of Representatives.

68
00:05:35,011 --> 00:05:40,897
[SPEAKER_13]: And we went over all the laws, and he agreed that it was ambiguous, that law that was attempted to be passed in 1975 that said

69
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:47,680
[SPEAKER_13]: the city of Medford can use the parkland for municipal purposes.

70
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:59,931
[SPEAKER_13]: And the best way to address this in the most direct way is to have the area taken out of parkland status and put into municipal use status.

71
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:04,515
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I drafted this home rule petition, which would accomplish that.

72
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:07,057
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, a couple of final points.

73
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:16,695
[SPEAKER_13]: This doesn't mean that if you live outside the city of Medford you can't go up and go fishing at Wright's Pond or access all of the parkland around the pond.

74
00:06:16,735 --> 00:06:17,415
[SPEAKER_13]: You can do that.

75
00:06:18,116 --> 00:06:25,460
[SPEAKER_13]: And it doesn't mean that if you're invited to come up by a resident of Medford that you couldn't go with them to access the pond.

76
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,781
[SPEAKER_13]: It does mean that the area of parking

77
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:47,508
[SPEAKER_13]: the bathhouses and also the beach area and the area around the beach area, I think there's a tot lot there also, would be on the face of it restricted to use by residents of the city of Medford, which by the way, functionally it has been for three decades or longer.

78
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:52,252
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.

79
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:53,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

80
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:55,195
[SPEAKER_07]: The chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

81
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:56,812
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

82
00:06:56,832 --> 00:07:02,817
[SPEAKER_23]: And I certainly think that this is a positive move, as far as I'm concerned.

83
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:09,183
[SPEAKER_23]: And my only concern when it comes to this, I do plan on voting for it this evening.

84
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:16,169
[SPEAKER_23]: But my one question is, you said outside people are still allowed to use their fishing and so on.

85
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:16,970
[SPEAKER_23]: Parkland, yes.

86
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,931
[SPEAKER_23]: Parkland, exactly.

87
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:21,714
[SPEAKER_23]: Is there a dollar amount that we're not going to be getting at this point?

88
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:25,186
[SPEAKER_23]: Has that been looked at as far as fees and stuff in the past?

89
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:33,583
[SPEAKER_13]: The fees have been set historically by the Park Commission and that would still be true for the area that's parked.

90
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:42,034
[SPEAKER_13]: but that would come under the DPW for the beach area and the swimming area, the bathhouse, and that sort of thing.

91
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,355
[SPEAKER_13]: So what the fees are, I couldn't say.

92
00:07:43,475 --> 00:07:56,046
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, the reason I ask, I want to make sure that because of this move this evening, next year people aren't going to be looking at a substantial increase in the fees because we are limiting certain resources to Medford residents only.

93
00:07:56,406 --> 00:08:01,650
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think that's a fair question and it's important.

94
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:03,852
[SPEAKER_23]: But I do plan on supporting this this evening.

95
00:08:05,187 --> 00:08:05,928
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

96
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Penta.

97
00:08:08,731 --> 00:08:16,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Mark, um, the act that was approved on December 8th, 1975, it's chapter seven 30 of, of the acts of the Commonwealth.

98
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:17,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

99
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:23,745
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first sentence reads that the city of method is hereby authorized to use for any municipal purpose, a certain parcel of land.

100
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:30,387
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it doesn't say a certain parcel of land says a certain parcel of parkland in said city bounded and described as follows.

101
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:30,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.

102
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:31,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

103
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:35,068
[SPEAKER_04]: And it goes to the not only in the southerly and southwesterly and blah, blah, blah.

104
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:35,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Yup.

105
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:43,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and the records from the state house as it relates to this, for which there was a full blown discussion, it reflected upon the fact that, um,

106
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,389
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at two particular parcels of land here.

107
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:50,009
[SPEAKER_04]: One is the park land where the beach is, and the other one is a playground area.

108
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:57,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And the playground area, which is separate and distinct, I believe at one point in time, the city received federal money for the purposes of upgrading it.

109
00:08:58,451 --> 00:09:06,653
[SPEAKER_04]: But subsequent to that, the city has, and the city's park department, I believe, retains control, ownership, and maintenance, and care for that piece of property.

110
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:13,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I, too, had a discussion with house council, and I believe that they said,

111
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:24,645
[SPEAKER_04]: It was their feeling and their understanding that at the time that this was passed in 1975, any municipal purpose would include for what we're talking about right now.

112
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:30,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got no problem and re-clarifying that, but it's been since 1975 till now and there's never been a problem.

113
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,611
[SPEAKER_13]: But it has this summer though, councilor.

114
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:43,880
[SPEAKER_04]: It became a problem this summer because somebody posed the question, but when you say it's authorized to you for use for any municipal purpose, the city of Medford is hereby authorized to use it for any municipal purpose.

115
00:09:44,503 --> 00:09:46,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was pretty clear back then.

116
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,008
[SPEAKER_13]: It is, but you have to finish the sentence.

117
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:53,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I know for any municipal purpose, a certain parcel of parkland and said city bounded and described as follows.

118
00:09:53,656 --> 00:09:54,377
[SPEAKER_04]: And it gets you to that.

119
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:54,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

120
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:56,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know it says parkland,

121
00:09:56,954 --> 00:10:00,477
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the legislation that you're filing, reverts it back to municipal land.

122
00:10:00,697 --> 00:10:00,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

123
00:10:01,177 --> 00:10:05,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And by making that distinction from parkland to municipal land, I understand all of that.

124
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,163
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, reviewing the, this was an in-depth discussion back in 1975.

125
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,044
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know that.

126
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:13,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was a representative at the time.

127
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:14,906
[SPEAKER_04]: And I co-sponsored that bill.

128
00:10:16,127 --> 00:10:17,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

129
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:20,210
[SPEAKER_13]: The newspaper reports, which say that you were in the house of representatives.

130
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:20,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

131
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:24,933
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that point in time, there was a huge discussion on that.

132
00:10:25,485 --> 00:10:33,336
[SPEAKER_04]: As it related to, and I think one of the arguments and the issues we used back then was if in fact the city was receiving federal money, it had to be opened up to the public.

133
00:10:33,776 --> 00:10:41,066
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe one of the arguments and then was by filing and having this piece of legislation and not taking future federal monies.

134
00:10:41,591 --> 00:10:43,192
[SPEAKER_04]: we could use it for any municipal purpose.

135
00:10:43,432 --> 00:10:50,096
[SPEAKER_04]: So all we're doing is basically taking out our parkland and making it a municipal purpose for whatever the municipal purpose might be.

136
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:54,059
[SPEAKER_13]: And the effort in 1975 was sufficient, sufficient for decades.

137
00:10:54,699 --> 00:11:02,764
[SPEAKER_13]: But when it's raised this year, and it would only, it's one of these questions that once it comes up, it'll come up repeatedly.

138
00:11:03,185 --> 00:11:06,407
[SPEAKER_13]: And so when I talked to Mr. Kennedy, and we went over this,

139
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:12,068
[SPEAKER_13]: The idea wasn't, oh, the legislation in 1975 was faulty.

140
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:26,931
[SPEAKER_13]: But it was that if it's going to be interpreted today, there's every likelihood that since the word parkland is in there, that the beach area, et cetera, would be then, by a judge, perhaps, in a court, made to be open to all other cities and towns.

141
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:28,791
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a corrective action.

142
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:30,771
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that.

143
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:34,472
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think also, so people can understand that while it's good corrective action,

144
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:40,138
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still going to be under the control of the city of Medford for Medford residents only.

145
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:40,958
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

146
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:41,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

147
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:41,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

148
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:42,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

149
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:43,840
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

150
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:44,680
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

151
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:45,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

152
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Council Penta chair recognizes vice president.

153
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:50,082
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

154
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:50,802
[SPEAKER_18]: President Teller.

155
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:56,845
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, city solicitor, what was the, was there any permits given to any non-residents this summer?

156
00:11:57,437 --> 00:12:06,264
[SPEAKER_13]: No, because the issue came up so late in the summer that when it went before the park board, it was the last week that the pond was open.

157
00:12:06,964 --> 00:12:10,127
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it didn't become an actual controversy.

158
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:17,112
[SPEAKER_18]: I only bring that up because I agree, you know, Councilor Caluso mentioned the issue with regards to raising the rates.

159
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:23,537
[SPEAKER_18]: So I bring that up because there were two things that, especially those that use rights pond, there were two things that kind of

160
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,054
[SPEAKER_18]: made people in an uproar over the summer.

161
00:12:26,214 --> 00:12:32,395
[SPEAKER_18]: One was the way the rates were raised, not notifying anybody of the hearing when the rates were raised.

162
00:12:32,715 --> 00:12:43,918
[SPEAKER_18]: And then also this issue with regards to next summer possibly allowing non-residents to use the pond and how it is a small beach so people want to keep it just Medford residents.

163
00:12:43,978 --> 00:12:50,180
[SPEAKER_18]: So those are the two main issues and I just really hope that rates are not again raised next year.

164
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,441
[SPEAKER_18]: So it doesn't sound like the case considering no permits were

165
00:12:53,918 --> 00:12:55,739
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, paid for by non-residents.

166
00:12:56,119 --> 00:13:03,203
[SPEAKER_18]: I just think that needs to be brought up again because the way it happened, I didn't like the way it happened.

167
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:12,347
[SPEAKER_18]: We've, we all spoke against the way it happened and the amounts of fees are raised, but hopefully the rates will stay the same and not go up any further next year.

168
00:13:12,787 --> 00:13:13,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

169
00:13:13,107 --> 00:13:21,452
[SPEAKER_13]: I think those are sound sentiments and there's also ample time to address those concerns between now and the opening of the beach next year.

170
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:22,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

171
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:24,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

172
00:13:24,174 --> 00:13:25,735
[SPEAKER_07]: The Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

173
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:29,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and Solicitor Rumley, thank you very much.

174
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:35,396
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is a great step in the right direction to solidify our position here and to allow us to continue our current practice.

175
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:43,578
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the work that you've done, and I see no problem with this language or this ordinance change — this homeown petition, Mr. President.

176
00:13:43,598 --> 00:13:44,858
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I'd move for approval at this point.

177
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:49,299
[SPEAKER_07]: So, on the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

178
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:50,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

179
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Camuso.

180
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:59,504
[SPEAKER_23]: If we could also just send a little note of thanks to Representative Donato for offering the services of the House Council.

181
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:06,209
[SPEAKER_23]: I would say that this has a favorable shot of getting passed when it hits there where they were an integral part of drafting the language.

182
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,110
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, they were quite helpful.

183
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:09,351
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

184
00:14:11,553 --> 00:14:13,554
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of approval, the second is here.

185
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:17,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Camuso?

186
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:18,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

187
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:19,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello?

188
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:20,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

189
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:21,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

190
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:21,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

191
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

192
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:23,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

193
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:24,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

194
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:24,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

195
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta.

196
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:26,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

197
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:28,261
[SPEAKER_06]: President De La Rosa.

198
00:14:28,381 --> 00:14:28,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

199
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:32,082
[SPEAKER_07]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative and non-negative, the motion passes.

200
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Mrs. Solicitor.

201
00:14:34,763 --> 00:14:39,125
[SPEAKER_07]: So now to take 15-681 off the table, law claim for $24,000, Adrian Appel and John Green.

202
00:14:44,026 --> 00:14:50,912
[SPEAKER_07]: This was tabled last week for some finishing touches that the solicitor needed to make.

203
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:55,375
[SPEAKER_07]: So the matter is now before us again on the motion of Councilor Knight.

204
00:14:56,276 --> 00:15:02,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Solicitor, if you want to present on this matter to bring us up to date on those issues.

205
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:04,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

206
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:09,286
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the matter that has been discussed a couple of times before.

207
00:15:09,766 --> 00:15:11,748
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the first time it's been on the council floor.

208
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:18,697
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to give a brief recitation of the facts and why this matter is before you.

209
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:30,066
[SPEAKER_13]: The facts are these, that for some time, John Grebe and Adrian Appel were caretakers at the Brooks Estate.

210
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:31,527
[SPEAKER_13]: They are married.

211
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:41,735
[SPEAKER_13]: And it came to our attention last year, they were blessed to be having a child.

212
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:52,357
[SPEAKER_13]: And that became problematic because of the age of the Brooks Estate, the fact that there is lead, and other difficulties there.

213
00:15:52,978 --> 00:15:59,860
[SPEAKER_13]: And certainly, we didn't want to have the child come back to a dangerous situation.

214
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:10,444
[SPEAKER_13]: We were advised by our experts that as long as the child was an infant and not ambulatory or walking around, that that shouldn't be a concern.

215
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:23,077
[SPEAKER_13]: and that was fine because we were in contact, that is myself and other people at City Hall, Karen Rose and Louise Miller, we were in contact with Mr. Grebe and Ms.

216
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:26,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Appel about what their intentions were.

217
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:33,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Because as the child would grow, they would have to leave the premises if we were going to begin to de-lead.

218
00:16:34,423 --> 00:16:40,666
[SPEAKER_13]: So we received some cost estimates on de-leading the Brooks Estate, and that would be required to be done both

219
00:16:41,322 --> 00:16:43,723
[SPEAKER_13]: on an interior and exterior basis.

220
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:57,185
[SPEAKER_13]: The cost would be, and I'm being, I'm just giving an example or estimating, the cost would be $350,000 or better to DLED, more on the better side.

221
00:16:58,406 --> 00:17:04,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So we did have a conversation with Mr. Pell and Mr. Grebe about what their intentions were, and they weren't sure.

222
00:17:05,147 --> 00:17:09,328
[SPEAKER_13]: So they took a little bit of time, and then they said that they would,

223
00:17:10,552 --> 00:17:15,234
[SPEAKER_13]: move, but we had to work out some terms to assist them in moving.

224
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:19,496
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the $24,000 figure that's in the settlement agreement.

225
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:31,421
[SPEAKER_13]: In return, the agreement that they have right now with the Brooks Estates would be voided, and we would go on to the future.

226
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:34,922
[SPEAKER_13]: If the settlement is not approved,

227
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:37,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Then Mr. Grebe and Ms.

228
00:17:37,894 --> 00:17:48,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Appel would have the right to return to the Brooks Estate at some point after deletting, and we would have to begin the process of getting that deletting done fairly soon.

229
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:59,166
[SPEAKER_13]: And in the meantime, put up with their, not put up in a negative sense, but be responsible for their living in another space while the deletting was going on.

230
00:18:00,126 --> 00:18:02,347
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we have before you this agreement.

231
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:05,400
[SPEAKER_13]: I had it in your packet on Friday.

232
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,401
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope you had an opportunity to read it, and we'll answer your questions if you have any.

233
00:18:11,762 --> 00:18:13,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

234
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,423
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

235
00:18:17,204 --> 00:18:31,048
[SPEAKER_18]: I just have a question with regards to, we know that the board, Brooks Estate's board, signed the lease with this couple, or actually at the time it was just the gentlemen.

236
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:43,734
[SPEAKER_18]: The city, we discussed in our meetings over the summer that the city really didn't know they were going to have to do that, yet we consider the Brooks estate's part of Medford.

237
00:18:44,695 --> 00:18:57,463
[SPEAKER_18]: So going forward then, I guess, because if we do pay them to, I guess that would be the 24,000 probably living expenses for six months to a year.

238
00:18:57,483 --> 00:18:58,944
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a number of things in there, yes.

239
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:07,083
[SPEAKER_18]: What are we going to do as a city to make sure that this doesn't happen again?

240
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:11,944
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there been any restrictions with regards to people, caretakers living on the property?

241
00:19:12,424 --> 00:19:19,066
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there any restrictions to maybe just a daytime caretaker who comes a few hours a day, checks on the property?

242
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:25,047
[SPEAKER_18]: What is going to be done so that we don't run into this again in six months, a year, two years, five years down the road?

243
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:29,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the issue you're bringing up, of course, is the primary issue.

244
00:19:31,597 --> 00:19:46,028
[SPEAKER_13]: As I stated to the council earlier, I've had discussions with Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Carr about them working with my office to draft up any future agreement that might take place.

245
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:49,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, you might say it's pretty simple to do so.

246
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:55,776
[SPEAKER_13]: But in truth, any human being, any qualified human being, can adopt a child.

247
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:06,395
[SPEAKER_13]: If there was going to be an agreement which would prohibit that type of activity by even a single caretaker, well, we'd have to look at all that.

248
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:11,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Your idea about having just somebody there during the day or part-time, that might be viable.

249
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,783
[SPEAKER_13]: There's any number of language things that we may be able to build in.

250
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:21,610
[SPEAKER_13]: But the one assurance I can give the council is that the people at the Brooks Estate, Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Carr, and others, have given us

251
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:41,534
[SPEAKER_13]: their assurance that they will engage in the appropriate level of dialogue with my office to come up with an agreement in the future, or perhaps another method, in order to make sure that the estate is secure, but more importantly, that we can go on without this occurring again.

252
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:45,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the deletting of that property would be quite expensive.

253
00:20:46,174 --> 00:20:46,774
[SPEAKER_13]: That's for sure.

254
00:20:46,794 --> 00:20:49,475
[SPEAKER_13]: And so what we want to do is to make sure that the property is

255
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:56,295
[SPEAKER_13]: protected, but on the other hand, that the exposure of the city from a liability point of view doesn't raise its head again.

256
00:20:57,675 --> 00:21:15,923
[SPEAKER_18]: Just from my point of view, I agree with this and want to vote to just take care of the situation because I know of what we'd have to do as a city with regards to the $350,000 to de-lead it, plus putting the couple up for the time it takes to de-lead.

257
00:21:15,943 --> 00:21:16,963
[SPEAKER_18]: We'd have to pay for that.

258
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,860
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think this makes sense.

259
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,462
[SPEAKER_18]: Now my only concern is even with what you just said, you've had discussions with the board.

260
00:21:25,362 --> 00:21:30,723
[SPEAKER_18]: You may be able to, and also they gave you their assurance.

261
00:21:30,883 --> 00:21:36,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I would feel much more comfortable as a Councilor to maybe have a written agreement with the board.

262
00:21:36,404 --> 00:21:41,986
[SPEAKER_18]: I think as the city who owns the property, we should 100%

263
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:51,621
[SPEAKER_18]: know what's going on and know who this is being rented to, who's signing leases with the Brooks Estate.

264
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:54,802
[SPEAKER_18]: They didn't allow that at the beginning.

265
00:21:54,862 --> 00:21:58,323
[SPEAKER_18]: We had no idea when they were signing the lease.

266
00:21:58,343 --> 00:22:01,844
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you mentioned that you were unaware of, you never read the lease.

267
00:22:02,884 --> 00:22:12,847
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like I would really like something in writing saying before any lease is signed, before any agreement is determined, but before

268
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:20,833
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, whether it's with the council or not, I think set guidelines need to be put in place and 100% agreed to with the board.

269
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:21,794
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

270
00:22:21,994 --> 00:22:23,935
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand your sentiments, but I'd say this.

271
00:22:24,555 --> 00:22:32,820
[SPEAKER_13]: If this agreement, if this settlement is not approved, there's every likelihood that our ability to resolve this with Mr. Grebe and Ms.

272
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Appel will probably dissipate and go away.

273
00:22:37,103 --> 00:22:39,944
[SPEAKER_13]: In that instance, they're still going to have a right to come back.

274
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:42,526
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I'm saying to you is that,

275
00:22:43,318 --> 00:22:56,705
[SPEAKER_13]: and I've had this discussion with another board, there is not going to be another agreement with anyone at that property to be there as a caretaker unless that agreement is approved by my office.

276
00:22:56,746 --> 00:23:00,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I'm not trying to pontificate, but I'm saying it's not going to happen.

277
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:04,650
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing is, it's not the only option in order to protect that property.

278
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,032
[SPEAKER_13]: There are electronic ways to do things.

279
00:23:07,092 --> 00:23:12,097
[SPEAKER_13]: There are sensors and video that can be utilized in order to secure the property.

280
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Human presence is not necessarily the only way to go.

281
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:29,753
[SPEAKER_13]: But I also don't want to be cavalier with the discretion of the board, because in fact, the board is the managing entity of that property, and I want to respect their prerogatives.

282
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:36,723
[SPEAKER_13]: But conversely, I want to make sure that in exercising their discretion, we're not faced with this again.

283
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:38,324
[SPEAKER_13]: An example.

284
00:23:38,644 --> 00:23:46,629
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be benign to say, well, we could always rent to a 70-year-old caretaker who's single, can't possibly have a child.

285
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:49,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, he could if he adopts.

286
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,172
[SPEAKER_13]: There is not one human being that could not bring a child into that building.

287
00:23:53,752 --> 00:23:58,395
[SPEAKER_13]: So the language, if there was ever going to be language to allow a human being to go in there for caretaking,

288
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:13,192
[SPEAKER_13]: prerogatives again would have to be so restricted as to ensure that there's an acknowledgement of the lead in the building and that no child will be brought in under guardianship or adoption or other ways to the caretaker.

289
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:18,616
[SPEAKER_13]: That might be addressed if we had a part-time caretaker who was up there during the day or at staggered hours.

290
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:21,217
[SPEAKER_13]: There are a number of different variables to do this.

291
00:24:21,857 --> 00:24:26,098
[SPEAKER_13]: And I understand and I think that your concerns are prudent, reasonable, and professional.

292
00:24:26,578 --> 00:24:33,299
[SPEAKER_13]: But I also think that at this juncture, at this crossroads, the question is whether to accept this $24,000 settlement or prepare for $350,000 plus.

293
00:24:38,827 --> 00:24:49,294
[SPEAKER_18]: and I would feel more comfortable if we, in no fault of your own, you were working to negotiate this agreement, I would feel more comfortable knowing that we set guidelines.

294
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:59,001
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand the board should have some discretion, but obviously their discretion has led to probably a possible $350,000 problem on the backs of the taxpayers.

295
00:24:59,421 --> 00:25:02,984
[SPEAKER_18]: And even with a $24,000 vote, that still does not come easy.

296
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:07,327
[SPEAKER_18]: That's on the backs of the taxpayers who have to pay off a couple that were, you know,

297
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:13,710
[SPEAKER_18]: gentleman who moved in there under a lease signed by a lease that was never read by the city solicitor's office.

298
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:15,491
[SPEAKER_18]: No fault of your own.

299
00:25:15,772 --> 00:25:18,813
[SPEAKER_18]: The board never brought it to your office.

300
00:25:18,873 --> 00:25:20,514
[SPEAKER_18]: And that doesn't sit well.

301
00:25:20,695 --> 00:25:23,736
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if it's, you know, I'm sure it doesn't sit well with the rest of the council.

302
00:25:23,776 --> 00:25:25,217
[SPEAKER_18]: It just doesn't sit well with me.

303
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:28,539
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just want to make sure that this doesn't happen again.

304
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:31,241
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope that we can come up.

305
00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:36,444
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe as a B paper, we sit down and have a meeting with your office within the next

306
00:25:36,938 --> 00:25:42,080
[SPEAKER_18]: you know, few weeks and we discuss in the board and discuss how this is not going to happen again.

307
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,442
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be, I'd be certainly agreeable to that scenario.

308
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:53,406
[SPEAKER_18]: I would make that a B paper so that we can round table a discussion with regards to what is the best for the Brooks estates.

309
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:59,329
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, we do have, you know, we do represent the taxpayers and this is taxpayers money that's being used.

310
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:03,651
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think the board has to understand that we want to make sure this doesn't happen again.

311
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:06,132
[SPEAKER_18]: So, um, if that can be done, I,

312
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:08,248
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a good measure.

313
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:10,510
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

314
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

315
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:15,073
[SPEAKER_07]: The chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

316
00:26:16,254 --> 00:26:20,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, Mr. Solicitor, for your presentation.

317
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:32,447
[SPEAKER_14]: My question is along the lines of Councilor Lungo-Koehn, and I posed the question to you last week, actually, and I was hoping to get a response from EMBELT.

318
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:33,188
[SPEAKER_13]: You do.

319
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:35,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

320
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:35,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Rose.

321
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:40,528
[SPEAKER_13]: talk to a member of Inbuilt along the lines of the question that you asked.

322
00:26:40,748 --> 00:26:41,970
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, I forgot about that.

323
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:42,590
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

324
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:45,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, Councilors.

325
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:48,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Karen Rose, Director of Public Health, City of Medford.

326
00:26:49,716 --> 00:26:58,144
[SPEAKER_17]: I did have a conversation over the phone with Doug Carr, and basically he was asking if somebody could live there again.

327
00:26:58,164 --> 00:27:01,807
[SPEAKER_17]: And basically under the state sanitary code for housing,

328
00:27:02,383 --> 00:27:11,866
[SPEAKER_17]: I told him under the conditions that exist right now with some of the other issues, not necessarily the lead, I wouldn't advocate for it right now.

329
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:13,206
[SPEAKER_17]: I would stop it.

330
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:18,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, having said that, there are things that can be done to change that.

331
00:27:19,948 --> 00:27:21,429
[SPEAKER_17]: But that is my feeling right now.

332
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:22,749
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's where we left it.

333
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:28,031
[SPEAKER_17]: And he was going to look at other options for TVing it.

334
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:30,072
[SPEAKER_17]: There is security systems there.

335
00:27:30,492 --> 00:27:31,552
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not as if there's none.

336
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:38,617
[SPEAKER_17]: But to look at TV cameras, that kind of thing, the same type of thing that we use at the schools and other places.

337
00:27:39,237 --> 00:27:41,779
[SPEAKER_17]: So that was where we left off with that conversation.

338
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

339
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,924
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're saying as the director of the Board of Health that you would not allow anyone to live in that place?

340
00:27:48,944 --> 00:27:53,427
[SPEAKER_17]: What I would utilize is the minimum standards for housing, 105 CMR 410.

341
00:27:54,768 --> 00:27:59,672
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would use that as my reason for not having somebody live there presently.

342
00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:10,689
[SPEAKER_17]: And as things improve and some of the improvements are made, then my colleague would definitely be looking at other options with EMBL.

343
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:13,510
[SPEAKER_17]: But for right now, no, I wouldn't have anybody live there.

344
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

345
00:28:15,591 --> 00:28:16,691
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you very much.

346
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:17,692
[SPEAKER_14]: That was very helpful.

347
00:28:18,212 --> 00:28:21,913
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess that leads to my question that was pretty much asked already.

348
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:26,675
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not sure, Mr. Solicitor, if you can answer this, but I think it's imperative that

349
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:37,856
[SPEAKER_14]: be able to tell us what their long-term plan is to make sure that this building has a presence, is maintained, and so forth, where it is a city-owned building.

350
00:28:40,156 --> 00:28:45,118
[SPEAKER_14]: I know they have kept this building up over the years.

351
00:28:45,675 --> 00:28:50,237
[SPEAKER_14]: have done their due diligence in making sure this building is what it is currently today.

352
00:28:51,138 --> 00:28:53,539
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it's extremely important.

353
00:28:54,059 --> 00:29:02,083
[SPEAKER_14]: When I read through the document itself, Lieutenant Will, it really describes what the caretakers were doing in great detail.

354
00:29:03,184 --> 00:29:07,526
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it wasn't just a matter of fact that they were turning a key and laying their head down on a bed.

355
00:29:08,186 --> 00:29:11,148
[SPEAKER_14]: They had a number of duties and tasks that they were responsible for.

356
00:29:11,765 --> 00:29:16,949
[SPEAKER_14]: on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, and also to document this activity.

357
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:26,937
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would say at the time that they signed this, EMBEL thought it was very important to have someone that was actually living in the building to make sure that building was maintained.

358
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:33,322
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to hear what their response is now, and I know you're not going to give that to us, but I'd really like to.

359
00:29:33,362 --> 00:29:36,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I don't have it, in the sense that anything definitive.

360
00:29:38,052 --> 00:29:48,377
[SPEAKER_14]: It would have been great, Mr. President, to have members of EMBELT present at this meeting to answer some questions regarding this, because it's been on the agenda.

361
00:29:48,397 --> 00:29:50,998
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe this is the third time this has been on the agenda.

362
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:52,779
[SPEAKER_14]: The President Second time at open meeting, yes.

363
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,280
[SPEAKER_14]: The Vice President Second time at open meeting.

364
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,641
[SPEAKER_14]: And we had another meeting that was canceled.

365
00:29:57,121 --> 00:29:59,502
[SPEAKER_14]: But I believe that aspect.

366
00:30:00,162 --> 00:30:01,563
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

367
00:30:02,003 --> 00:30:03,664
[SPEAKER_14]: It is extremely important to find out

368
00:30:04,357 --> 00:30:05,618
[SPEAKER_14]: what the long-range plan is.

369
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:07,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Lead paint is one issue.

370
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,661
[SPEAKER_14]: We have an issue of the road leading up to the manor.

371
00:30:11,461 --> 00:30:14,343
[SPEAKER_14]: We have issues that we heard from the Board of Health.

372
00:30:14,903 --> 00:30:16,024
[SPEAKER_14]: There's mold in the building.

373
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:19,626
[SPEAKER_14]: The water quality, I'm not sure if it's been tested recently.

374
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:21,047
[SPEAKER_14]: That's okay, we're hearing.

375
00:30:21,427 --> 00:30:23,168
[SPEAKER_14]: How about the air quality throughout the building?

376
00:30:23,228 --> 00:30:23,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Has that been tested?

377
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,611
[SPEAKER_14]: So everything's been tested?

378
00:30:27,631 --> 00:30:27,671
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

379
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:43,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Just before Thanksgiving, because the water quality issue was brought to my attention and they were still living there, I had done the testing on the water in that past.

380
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:43,830
[SPEAKER_17]: That is fine.

381
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:47,993
[SPEAKER_17]: But as far as air quality and that kind of thing, we didn't go that far.

382
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:54,759
[SPEAKER_17]: If they were going to de-lead, they would have to do air quality testing after that remediation.

383
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,862
[SPEAKER_17]: So we didn't do air quality testing in the meanwhile.

384
00:30:57,882 --> 00:30:59,263
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

385
00:30:59,283 --> 00:30:59,623
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

386
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:00,244
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

387
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:05,558
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

388
00:31:07,078 --> 00:31:12,180
[SPEAKER_14]: My last point, Mr. President, and I just want to bring it up for discussion.

389
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:20,302
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do plan on supporting this tonight because I think this is the lesser of two evils, to be quite honest with you.

390
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:23,043
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not happy how this unfolded.

391
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:28,164
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not happy the fact that the city wasn't aware of this agreement when it was signed.

392
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:30,565
[SPEAKER_14]: But it goes on, Mr. President.

393
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:36,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Solicitor, under Section 5, Utilities, it says, the tenant shall pay.

394
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:38,676
[SPEAKER_14]: We all know they don't pay any rent at all.

395
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:41,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this is the old agreement you're talking about.

396
00:31:41,737 --> 00:31:41,917
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

397
00:31:42,157 --> 00:31:42,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

398
00:31:43,397 --> 00:31:47,019
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was the agreement that was signed that the caretakers will not pay rent.

399
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,700
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was the agreement between M-Belt and the caretakers.

400
00:31:50,540 --> 00:32:00,964
[SPEAKER_14]: But it also goes on in Section 5 under Utilities, and it says, the tenant shall pay, as they come due, all bills for electricity furnished to the premise, all bills for heating,

401
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:10,377
[SPEAKER_14]: for oil furnished to the premise, and part C, upon notice from the city of Medford, bills for water and sewer services, so furnished by the city of Medford.

402
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:27,227
[SPEAKER_14]: I happen to have contacted the water department, I contacted Mr. Pompeo, the city treasurer's office, and there hasn't been a bill, water and sewer, issued in that premise, at least in the past eight or nine years.

403
00:32:28,328 --> 00:32:34,640
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not sure, from what I can understand, it's not needed either, that particular.

404
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:37,135
[SPEAKER_14]: site.

405
00:32:37,775 --> 00:32:50,581
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think this is really something that we should do as a city, because I would say any other resident in this community, uh, when they hear that, uh, people living there, not paying their water and sewer, I think rightfully should be upset about that.

406
00:32:50,861 --> 00:32:52,201
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that entirely.

407
00:32:52,342 --> 00:32:56,223
[SPEAKER_14]: If it was part of the agreement, like they're not paying rent, then that's part of the agreement.

408
00:32:56,243 --> 00:33:01,165
[SPEAKER_14]: We all have to live with it, but it's clearly stated in this document that they should pay water and sewer.

409
00:33:01,585 --> 00:33:02,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, if the city's at fault,

410
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:08,352
[SPEAKER_14]: not putting them on notice of a water and sewer bill, then I think we have to find that out.

411
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:11,875
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask that, Mr. President, through the paper tonight.

412
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:13,116
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, I will support this.

413
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:18,621
[SPEAKER_14]: But I want to know if that particular piece of property is meted out, first of all.

414
00:33:19,222 --> 00:33:24,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Why hasn't a bill been issued in the past eight or nine years to that particular piece of property?

415
00:33:25,147 --> 00:33:27,670
[SPEAKER_14]: And it may be after the fact, and I appreciate you've already

416
00:33:28,851 --> 00:33:29,811
[SPEAKER_14]: put together an agreement.

417
00:33:30,431 --> 00:33:40,394
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, I would like to see, you know, I believe there was a security deposit put up some years ago.

418
00:33:41,575 --> 00:33:49,037
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not sure if it would be appropriate or not, but I'd like to see the security deposit used towards the water and sewer.

419
00:33:49,937 --> 00:33:53,878
[SPEAKER_14]: It falls far short of the mark of nine years worth of water and sewer.

420
00:33:55,695 --> 00:34:04,137
[SPEAKER_13]: It may be appropriate or reasonable to bring that up in the discussion that goes along as part of the B paper when we have our meeting.

421
00:34:05,198 --> 00:34:07,098
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would offer that as a B paper.

422
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:09,279
[SPEAKER_07]: That's an amendment to the B paper.

423
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:10,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

424
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:16,942
[SPEAKER_14]: The fact that if the homes needed, why hasn't there been a bill issued in the last eight or nine years of water and sewer?

425
00:34:18,008 --> 00:34:18,308
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

426
00:34:18,568 --> 00:34:21,810
[SPEAKER_07]: With that meeting, we're going to have with the M-Belt Board of Directors.

427
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this would be internally.

428
00:34:24,031 --> 00:34:28,814
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Water and Sewage Department should be able to tell us why a bill wasn't created for that site.

429
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:31,716
[SPEAKER_07]: So ask for a response from the Water and Sewage Department.

430
00:34:32,401 --> 00:34:40,890
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd be curious to see if they were aware of this agreement that this particular parcel, because city-owned buildings right now don't pay water and sewer.

431
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,452
[SPEAKER_14]: That comes under unaccounted for water.

432
00:34:44,313 --> 00:34:47,196
[SPEAKER_14]: And that gets paid by every taxpayer in this community.

433
00:34:47,657 --> 00:34:49,198
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not meted out separately.

434
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:50,840
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a city-owned building.

435
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,763
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can see why possibly it's not meted out separately.

436
00:34:53,823 --> 00:34:55,645
[SPEAKER_14]: But how do you enter into an agreement

437
00:34:56,148 --> 00:35:02,775
[SPEAKER_14]: unless they plan on estimating the water and sewer up there, like they did for many years in this community before we got the new meters.

438
00:35:03,256 --> 00:35:05,538
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think those are important questions, Mr. President.

439
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:06,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

440
00:35:06,919 --> 00:35:07,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

441
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

442
00:35:09,622 --> 00:35:11,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

443
00:35:11,284 --> 00:35:12,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I apologize for that mistake.

444
00:35:12,645 --> 00:35:13,667
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's okay, Mr. President.

445
00:35:13,707 --> 00:35:14,567
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an important issue.

446
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:17,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly support

447
00:35:19,396 --> 00:35:21,518
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that the ends justify the means.

448
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:26,764
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to bring us to a resolve in the situation that's before us, and it's going to be the most cost-effective way for us to deal with it.

449
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:35,755
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I too share the concerns of my colleagues relative to the board and what decision-making processes the board's making, and the council has a board appointee.

450
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:45,180
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was wondering if the Board of Point D could bring us up to speed on the recent talks that they've had relative to, you know, the ongoing situation at the Shepherd Brook Manor, what their future plans are.

451
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:57,134
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that there's been a strong push of support from the members of the Metro Brooks Estate Land Trust to, you know, build the carriage house up and turn it into a function facility of some sort.

452
00:35:57,854 --> 00:36:01,097
[SPEAKER_10]: That matter came before the council, it failed, and now we are where we are.

453
00:36:01,558 --> 00:36:05,441
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess the question is, Mr. President, going forward, what steps are we going to take?

454
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:10,405
[SPEAKER_10]: And if the gentleman could fill us in a little bit on what's been going on down there, that would be very helpful to, I think, this board.

455
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:18,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Back several months ago, I thought that it might be a good idea for us to sit down and kind of develop parameters for the council appointees that we put on these boards and commissions.

456
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:26,581
[SPEAKER_10]: And the reason I thought that is because when situations like this arise, then at least we'd have some information beforehand, afterhand, and a real good understanding of what's going on in the process.

457
00:36:27,322 --> 00:36:32,308
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that, Mr. President, through you, I ask the question as to if the gentleman could provide us with any information as to

458
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:42,694
[SPEAKER_10]: what's going on at the Mecklenburg estate land trust, what's going on at the Sheppard brook manor in terms of future plans, now that the carriage house proposal has been brought before the council, the carriage house proposal failed.

459
00:36:43,695 --> 00:36:52,424
[SPEAKER_10]: We had an emergency request for appropriation up there, I think of about $275,000 over in the winter, Mr. President, to address some emergency issues that are up there.

460
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,886
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it might be nice for us to get a full picture of what's going on.

461
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:56,308
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly support

462
00:36:56,608 --> 00:37:02,089
[SPEAKER_10]: the endeavor and the underlying piece of potential litigation that we're going to be faced with or the potential cost of deletting.

463
00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:04,430
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm definitely going to support the paper this evening.

464
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:07,050
[SPEAKER_10]: And it might not be a conversation for right now, Mr. President.

465
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:12,272
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be a conversation for later on, where we really get to roll up our sleeves and dig into it.

466
00:37:12,872 --> 00:37:15,512
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd ask, actually, Mr. President, maybe that we use this as a B paper.

467
00:37:15,552 --> 00:37:19,513
[SPEAKER_10]: We put it back on the agenda for a later date, and we give the gentleman some time to prepare something for us.

468
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:22,594
[SPEAKER_10]: He can come back and he can fill us in a little bit about what's going on there.

469
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:26,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think that in terms of the matter that's before this council right now, it's too

470
00:37:26,895 --> 00:37:35,882
[SPEAKER_10]: address the immediate issue that's at hand, which is, you know, the family that's living there and the birth of their child, and whether or not this $24,000 will resolve the issues that we're faced.

471
00:37:36,702 --> 00:37:37,543
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a good measure.

472
00:37:37,563 --> 00:37:43,847
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that, you know, the support of this appropriation will solve a lot of problems and will cost us less in the long run.

473
00:37:44,248 --> 00:37:48,831
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as part of the B paper, Mr. President, I'd also like the gentleman to give us a brief synopsis as to what's going on.

474
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:49,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

475
00:37:49,491 --> 00:37:50,232
[SPEAKER_10]: The President.

476
00:37:50,252 --> 00:37:50,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

477
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:54,495
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we're asking as part of the B paper, the main part of the B paper,

478
00:37:55,105 --> 00:38:01,028
[SPEAKER_07]: was to have a meeting with the board of directors of M-Belt.

479
00:38:02,048 --> 00:38:06,070
[SPEAKER_07]: The councilor is a representative to the M-Belt.

480
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,892
[SPEAKER_07]: If the councilor doesn't feel prepared to address any of these issues tonight.

481
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:15,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, it wasn't my intention to spring something on him like that at this point in time.

482
00:38:15,454 --> 00:38:15,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Not at all.

483
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:18,355
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about a multimillion dollar project over there.

484
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:21,756
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't expect him to just pull it off the cuff and throw it out here at the council meeting.

485
00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:22,937
[SPEAKER_10]: We all recognize that.

486
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:35,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if the councillor cares not to address the matter, the question was asked with that understanding, so there'd be no prejudice there.

487
00:38:35,662 --> 00:38:43,066
[SPEAKER_07]: So if the councillor feels that he's not ready to discuss any of the particulars tonight, he may choose not to do so.

488
00:38:43,627 --> 00:38:45,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Marx.

489
00:38:45,814 --> 00:38:47,475
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, NBELT is a board.

490
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:49,935
[SPEAKER_14]: It consists of a number of members of the board.

491
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:52,696
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I personally would like to hear from the board itself.

492
00:38:52,716 --> 00:38:55,997
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if Councilor Penta would like to speak on it, that's up to him.

493
00:38:56,057 --> 00:38:57,878
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'd rather hear from the board.

494
00:38:57,898 --> 00:39:00,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was the request that we all will come to an agreement on.

495
00:39:00,999 --> 00:39:01,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

496
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,479
[SPEAKER_07]: And sit down with the board in discussion.

497
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:05,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of further clarification, Madam Vice President.

498
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,321
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

499
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:14,983
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we did hear from the board through Karen Rose, and that is what really concerns me because

500
00:39:15,595 --> 00:39:16,235
[SPEAKER_18]: There's mold.

501
00:39:17,156 --> 00:39:17,716
[SPEAKER_18]: There's lead.

502
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:23,318
[SPEAKER_18]: That is going to cost $350,000 to repair or remediate.

503
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:29,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Yet somebody from the board is now currently asking if they can put somebody in there to live.

504
00:39:29,821 --> 00:39:33,223
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what concerns me, that we don't have control of the situation.

505
00:39:33,243 --> 00:39:34,183
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why we need to bring them up.

506
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:34,864
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why, yeah.

507
00:39:35,384 --> 00:39:42,687
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the board needs to, if they know of these issues and they still want to put somebody there to sleep there at night,

508
00:39:43,037 --> 00:39:46,138
[SPEAKER_18]: there is a serious problem and we need to make sure we get a grip on this.

509
00:39:46,638 --> 00:39:46,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

510
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:52,579
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, uh, we are made the two points of clarification.

511
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:58,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight, are you, uh, motion for approval by Councilor Knight?

512
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:09,042
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, council Caraviello president, um, all of our, all of my fellow Councilors have brought up a valid points, um, at the meeting.

513
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:10,462
[SPEAKER_19]: I like to have that meeting, um,

514
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:21,433
[SPEAKER_19]: sooner rather than later with the board, and I would ask that Karen rose also be present at that meeting when we have it along with Mr. Rumley.

515
00:40:23,174 --> 00:40:40,663
[SPEAKER_19]: My only question is, you know, when the board comes, I would like to see them bring forward all the issues that need attention right now, rather than waiting, you know, all the issues, especially these ones about the health and

516
00:40:41,698 --> 00:40:43,279
[SPEAKER_19]: And safety will be brought forth.

517
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:54,844
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, Ian, if there are any finances for M-Belts, who is now responsible for these bills, the electric, the heat?

518
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Does the city take responsibility for that now?

519
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:08,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I can tell you right now that in the interim, when we have no one there to pay whatever the agreed rent was under the old agreement, that would be borne essentially by the city.

520
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:11,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's our, it's our building.

521
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:15,175
[SPEAKER_19]: Does the Brooks have funds to pay these in the intro or the city?

522
00:41:15,396 --> 00:41:17,517
[SPEAKER_13]: I couldn't answer that.

523
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:21,341
[SPEAKER_19]: When they come to that meeting, if they can bring some type of financial report.

524
00:41:21,361 --> 00:41:22,542
[SPEAKER_19]: So we know if there is any funding.

525
00:41:22,782 --> 00:41:23,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I agree with that.

526
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:35,373
[SPEAKER_07]: As an amendment to the, as an amendment to the beep paper, we're going to ask that Karen Rose be a present for the meeting and that M belt be able to provide to the Medford city council

527
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:48,677
[SPEAKER_07]: an update on the finances, both what they have as far as operational budget and what they have as part of also their endowment.

528
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:54,381
[SPEAKER_19]: And my last question was was Mr. Grebe or Mr. Appel issued a 1099?

529
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:57,222
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be answered by Ian Baker.

530
00:41:57,262 --> 00:41:58,643
[SPEAKER_13]: They certainly don't come out of my office.

531
00:41:58,763 --> 00:42:01,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Should they have been issued a 1099 in lieu of, right in lieu of pay?

532
00:42:03,615 --> 00:42:05,296
[SPEAKER_13]: for the value of what they received.

533
00:42:05,836 --> 00:42:07,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Offset by the value of what they paid.

534
00:42:08,498 --> 00:42:11,940
[SPEAKER_13]: I suppose that there may be something there, but I'll leave that to the financial people.

535
00:42:14,802 --> 00:42:15,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's a balance.

536
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:18,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

537
00:42:19,185 --> 00:42:22,928
[SPEAKER_07]: All set, Councilor?

538
00:42:23,128 --> 00:42:24,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caviallo.

539
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:26,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

540
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,474
[SPEAKER_04]: How long have the tenants been sitting there as a tenant at will?

541
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:38,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the agreement, the old agreement calls itself a tenant at will agreement, so that would be since 2007.

542
00:42:39,197 --> 00:42:40,578
[SPEAKER_13]: And from 2007.

543
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, no, September 14th, 2007.

544
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:48,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are the options on there for the tenancy to end?

545
00:42:49,004 --> 00:42:51,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Requirements by the tenant as compared to the city.

546
00:42:51,226 --> 00:42:56,129
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the requirements for this tenancy at will to not become operative any further?

547
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,310
[SPEAKER_13]: To not what?

548
00:42:57,651 --> 00:42:58,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Not become operative any further.

549
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,034
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well, the settlement agreement voids this contract.

550
00:43:02,672 --> 00:43:06,473
[SPEAKER_04]: If the tenant wanted to leave, what did they have to do, being a tenant?

551
00:43:06,493 --> 00:43:09,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I suppose they'd have to give appropriate notice under the agreement and leave.

552
00:43:09,634 --> 00:43:10,314
[SPEAKER_04]: And what about the city?

553
00:43:11,314 --> 00:43:15,295
[SPEAKER_13]: The city would have to ask them to leave if they were in default of the agreement.

554
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:21,797
[SPEAKER_13]: I was told by a member, I'll say it directly, I was told by Mr. Lincoln that they're not in default of any term.

555
00:43:22,617 --> 00:43:24,658
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, that they are the best caretakers they've ever had.

556
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:32,120
[SPEAKER_04]: On September 1st of 2011, each councilor received a huge packet

557
00:43:32,878 --> 00:43:45,380
[SPEAKER_04]: of a master plan for the Brooks Estate, which was a compilation of not only the outside, the inside, the area going up to it, and some of these issues that are being discussed here tonight are addressed in here.

558
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:50,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember any actual vote taken by this council not to approve it.

559
00:43:50,391 --> 00:43:54,272
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it, I don't think it's come up for a final vote one way or the other.

560
00:43:54,772 --> 00:43:55,553
[SPEAKER_13]: The agreement you mean?

561
00:43:55,673 --> 00:43:56,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

562
00:43:56,793 --> 00:44:00,314
[SPEAKER_04]: No, to approve the three and a half million dollars for the Brooks estates.

563
00:44:00,434 --> 00:44:02,134
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, for a capital improvement plan.

564
00:44:02,194 --> 00:44:04,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember any final vote by this council taking place.

565
00:44:05,135 --> 00:44:05,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

566
00:44:05,515 --> 00:44:11,477
[SPEAKER_04]: But putting that aside, uh, my only other question would be, um, as it relates to, you know, each and every year for many, many years,

567
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:16,722
[SPEAKER_04]: the city of Medford entertained community block grant funds to give to the Brooks Estates.

568
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:27,613
[SPEAKER_04]: And inclusive of those compensations, which a lot of the money has gone for rehabilitation, restoration of that, there were considerations as it related to some of the things that the councilors were talking here tonight.

569
00:44:28,174 --> 00:44:30,236
[SPEAKER_04]: So to some degree, I think the council management

570
00:44:32,014 --> 00:44:34,315
[SPEAKER_04]: administratively is aware of some of these concerns.

571
00:44:34,635 --> 00:44:35,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Have they been addressed?

572
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:36,396
[SPEAKER_04]: It's obvious that they're not.

573
00:44:37,056 --> 00:44:44,180
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I think it would be a wise move to meet with the board, especially and maybe have the council just refresh themselves and go through this book.

574
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:52,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's a lot of reading, but it does break down the entire reconstruction or new construction or the future, uh, uh, growth of, of the Brooks estates.

575
00:44:53,444 --> 00:44:55,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's just a shame that we have to get to this particular point.

576
00:44:56,826 --> 00:44:57,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um,

577
00:44:58,161 --> 00:45:03,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you want to call it the lesser of two evils, but this is what, if this is what it has to do to resolve it.

578
00:45:03,922 --> 00:45:13,904
[SPEAKER_04]: But I agree with councilor Longo, something has to be done before you move forward as it relates to the maintenance of the property and how it's going to be cared for because it is a city owned piece of property.

579
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:14,304
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

580
00:45:14,484 --> 00:45:18,845
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with you in your colloquialism that it is the lesser of two evils.

581
00:45:19,165 --> 00:45:23,846
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also agree with you that the watchword on this instance or this matter is to go forward.

582
00:45:24,627 --> 00:45:26,787
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not overly productive to stay in the past.

583
00:45:28,283 --> 00:45:28,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

584
00:45:28,923 --> 00:45:29,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

585
00:45:29,784 --> 00:45:30,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

586
00:45:30,124 --> 00:45:30,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor.

587
00:45:30,865 --> 00:45:36,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion for approval by council and night, second advice, vice president Longo current ma'am.

588
00:45:36,508 --> 00:45:36,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

589
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:38,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

590
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:38,809
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

591
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:40,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Gene Martin, 10 coming street.

592
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,032
[SPEAKER_16]: And my blood pressure goes up when we talk about this, uh, this house.

593
00:45:43,312 --> 00:45:43,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

594
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:48,415
[SPEAKER_16]: My blood pressure goes through no offense to all those volunteers and all that wonderful stuff.

595
00:45:48,855 --> 00:45:53,638
[SPEAKER_16]: They need to take that energy and put it in the library and the Chevalier and some other place because this house,

596
00:45:54,094 --> 00:45:56,976
[SPEAKER_16]: is the least essential building in the city.

597
00:45:57,777 --> 00:46:00,559
[SPEAKER_16]: It has the least amount of good for the bang for the buck.

598
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,721
[SPEAKER_16]: It is going to be the money pit.

599
00:46:03,162 --> 00:46:04,783
[SPEAKER_16]: No offense to any of the volunteers.

600
00:46:05,323 --> 00:46:07,265
[SPEAKER_16]: I thank God for them.

601
00:46:07,622 --> 00:46:09,403
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all well and good, but it's not good enough.

602
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:21,550
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a police station that's totally, the city hall out here, the cracks in the cement, right up here, the library, $15,000 they can't come up with for a bathroom fix.

603
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:27,233
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I just, no offense, but this is a luxury this city cannot afford.

604
00:46:27,813 --> 00:46:31,656
[SPEAKER_16]: And it just blows my mind that we keep on giving false hope

605
00:46:32,316 --> 00:46:35,997
[SPEAKER_16]: false hope to these people that this thing is going to come to fruition.

606
00:46:36,598 --> 00:46:37,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Under what administration?

607
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,159
[SPEAKER_16]: Not the next one.

608
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:50,943
[SPEAKER_16]: Not the next one, because I'm going to be up here talking about the police station, the city hall, the library, the Chevalier, the schools that need a 5% budgeting line item for maintenance.

609
00:46:51,443 --> 00:46:59,006
[SPEAKER_16]: So when you add all of that up, there is no money for this $3.5 million for this luxury house over there.

610
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:00,326
[SPEAKER_16]: There just is none.

611
00:47:00,887 --> 00:47:09,052
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, it's giving them false hope, or you're giving the police department false hope, or you're giving the city hall workers false hope, that you're going to fix this and you're going to fix this.

612
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:10,753
[SPEAKER_16]: You're giving somebody false hope.

613
00:47:11,193 --> 00:47:12,014
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know who it is.

614
00:47:12,494 --> 00:47:13,254
[SPEAKER_16]: Whatever you decide.

615
00:47:13,274 --> 00:47:17,037
[SPEAKER_16]: We need a priority list of what we're going to do with our money, and we need it now.

616
00:47:17,617 --> 00:47:19,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the money is not going to come from the feds.

617
00:47:20,299 --> 00:47:21,980
[SPEAKER_16]: The money is going to barely come from the state.

618
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:28,345
[SPEAKER_16]: And so if you could get that money from some benevolent cause, more power to you.

619
00:47:28,386 --> 00:47:29,306
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's not happening.

620
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:33,791
[SPEAKER_16]: And now we have people living in a house that is unviable.

621
00:47:34,412 --> 00:47:36,634
[SPEAKER_16]: It is not a viable occupational spot.

622
00:47:36,934 --> 00:47:41,559
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're going to be putting $350,000 just in lead base, lead paint.

623
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,641
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we're going to be doing this and that and the other.

624
00:47:43,922 --> 00:47:44,883
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's going to be the money pit.

625
00:47:45,343 --> 00:47:46,905
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to be a little bit here and a little bit there.

626
00:47:47,225 --> 00:47:48,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Doesn't that sound familiar?

627
00:47:48,647 --> 00:47:50,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that the mayor's old way of working?

628
00:47:50,889 --> 00:47:52,491
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that the old way of working for the mayor?

629
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Just, you know, patch it here.

630
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:55,514
[SPEAKER_16]: The boiler's in the high school now.

631
00:47:55,895 --> 00:47:57,336
[SPEAKER_16]: Not a capital improvement plan.

632
00:47:58,237 --> 00:47:59,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, my blood pressure's coming down.

633
00:47:59,939 --> 00:48:00,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

634
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,060
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't mean this in a bad way.

635
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:04,961
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd rather see it spent on education.

636
00:48:05,322 --> 00:48:10,023
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to see the police station before I see any school funding anymore.

637
00:48:10,483 --> 00:48:12,584
[SPEAKER_16]: But let me tell you, I'd rather have the $3.5 million, because right now it's only $350,000.

638
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:13,565
[SPEAKER_16]: But after that, the plan is $3.5 million.

639
00:48:13,585 --> 00:48:14,625
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's without cost overruns.

640
00:48:23,508 --> 00:48:26,691
[SPEAKER_16]: So now you're going to talk about $8 million by the time you get done with this project.

641
00:48:27,091 --> 00:48:30,775
[SPEAKER_16]: And it has the least amount of bang for its buck for the whole community.

642
00:48:31,215 --> 00:48:33,557
[SPEAKER_16]: Down in Method Square, we need to rebuild Method Square.

643
00:48:33,898 --> 00:48:35,659
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's why I like the library idea.

644
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,821
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why I like Chevalier.

645
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:42,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Put up that little sign up in the front of Chevalier, the marquee.

646
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:43,887
[SPEAKER_16]: That's worth $50,000 to me.

647
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:46,249
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's going to bring in business.

648
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,091
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's going to build on itself.

649
00:48:48,171 --> 00:48:48,832
[SPEAKER_16]: It's seed money.

650
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:53,955
[SPEAKER_16]: That thing down there is just a luxury that a very small portion of Medford even knows exists.

651
00:48:54,475 --> 00:48:57,417
[SPEAKER_16]: Not to mention access, and not to mention we'll rent our space.

652
00:48:57,657 --> 00:49:01,500
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not that big of a space to have a mass event in anyway, except for the outdoors.

653
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,981
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's only three, four months a year outdoors.

654
00:49:04,281 --> 00:49:06,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we have snow, we live in Massachusetts.

655
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,904
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, again, thank you to the volunteers.

656
00:49:09,944 --> 00:49:18,528
[SPEAKER_16]: I want you to take that energy that you've given to the Brooks and give it to the library, give it to the Chevalier, give it to the arts, give it to the new TV3, okay?

657
00:49:18,608 --> 00:49:20,368
[SPEAKER_16]: Give it to the new community access station.

658
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:26,111
[SPEAKER_16]: There is a place for those people that can volunteer and express themselves through the arts and through the building.

659
00:49:26,611 --> 00:49:26,991
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

660
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:28,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Jean.

661
00:49:28,392 --> 00:49:28,632
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

662
00:49:48,016 --> 00:49:50,638
[SPEAKER_03]: migraines from your life, but I'll take it off.

663
00:49:50,938 --> 00:49:54,561
[SPEAKER_03]: You just want to see my bald spot, that's all.

664
00:49:56,102 --> 00:49:57,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me say, I support the 24,000.

665
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, I do.

666
00:50:01,545 --> 00:50:09,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one of the most outspoken persons, as Mr. Penta, Councilor Penta, through the chair, knows.

667
00:50:10,791 --> 00:50:12,513
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do support the 24,000.

668
00:50:13,994 --> 00:50:15,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't support extortion.

669
00:50:17,476 --> 00:50:18,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what you've been talking about.

670
00:50:19,257 --> 00:50:19,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Look it up.

671
00:50:21,577 --> 00:50:28,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I also say I don't support a board in private industry that does similar things.

672
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,161
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't support that either.

673
00:50:32,441 --> 00:50:45,285
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the city of Medford, we support a board that Charlie Morelli, who was the chairman of the cemetery, a great friend,

674
00:50:46,483 --> 00:50:48,804
[SPEAKER_03]: argued that this was what was going to happen.

675
00:50:49,925 --> 00:50:52,346
[SPEAKER_03]: They promised to raise money.

676
00:50:53,506 --> 00:50:56,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Never happened.

677
00:50:56,167 --> 00:51:00,289
[SPEAKER_03]: $100,000, which the mayor helped get for them, is not raising money.

678
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:05,031
[SPEAKER_03]: They promised that nothing would go wrong up there.

679
00:51:05,792 --> 00:51:06,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Well,

680
00:51:07,455 --> 00:51:12,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been researching the idea that there was a leak in the oil tank.

681
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:14,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been told it's been corrected.

682
00:51:15,337 --> 00:51:15,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

683
00:51:16,217 --> 00:51:17,218
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

684
00:51:17,618 --> 00:51:24,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Now my property, which I'm about to leave, won't be affected by oil.

685
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:30,081
[SPEAKER_03]: But they haven't done a darn thing about the sewer.

686
00:51:31,882 --> 00:51:34,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did those children go to the bathroom, that child?

687
00:51:34,942 --> 00:51:36,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did those adults go to the bathroom?

688
00:51:38,048 --> 00:51:43,510
[SPEAKER_03]: How did they live in a house without a sewer?

689
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:46,651
[SPEAKER_03]: I have asked Ms.

690
00:51:46,711 --> 00:51:47,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Rose this.

691
00:51:48,892 --> 00:51:51,573
[SPEAKER_03]: She's told me that that's not connected.

692
00:51:52,214 --> 00:52:00,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So Michael, they might not need to spend money on a sewer system, meaning a bill for a sewer if they didn't have one.

693
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:09,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying to you that this has been a disastrous plan.

694
00:52:11,512 --> 00:52:17,314
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's look at this from a Mayor McGlynn point of view.

695
00:52:19,394 --> 00:52:27,116
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave Dugcar, the city gave Dugcar free building architectural drawing board.

696
00:52:27,837 --> 00:52:29,217
[SPEAKER_03]: A man who sits on the board.

697
00:52:30,968 --> 00:52:36,550
[SPEAKER_03]: The city has given Mr. Lincoln stretched it out over periods of time.

698
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:42,531
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't have to write up as president the reports to the city.

699
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:54,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, one of your city councilors now has 10 years worth of faults on the Brooks Estate.

700
00:52:54,575 --> 00:52:59,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm leaving, I felt that the city council should have

701
00:53:00,964 --> 00:53:05,166
[SPEAKER_03]: a historian that does look at what the thing's about.

702
00:53:05,346 --> 00:53:09,687
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't blame Councilor Penta for anything, because I doubt if they'd tell him.

703
00:53:10,347 --> 00:53:19,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I happen to believe he'd be here screaming, excuse me, discussing it much more in a light of what it has.

704
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:25,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you have discussed it in private or in your private meetings or your

705
00:53:26,762 --> 00:53:31,988
[SPEAKER_03]: group meetings, but we the public have been discussing it for 10 years.

706
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:38,635
[SPEAKER_03]: And we the public have said, you are doing it wrong.

707
00:53:39,396 --> 00:53:44,601
[SPEAKER_03]: We the public who have been business people have been saying, that's not the way it works, guys.

708
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing extortion all the time doesn't

709
00:53:49,767 --> 00:53:51,368
[SPEAKER_03]: do a good job.

710
00:53:51,808 --> 00:53:59,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I do agree that this time you need to give them the $24,000 because it will cost the taxpayers.

711
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,772
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe I'd become a fiscal conservative.

712
00:54:02,932 --> 00:54:03,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt it.

713
00:54:04,233 --> 00:54:05,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe in Keynesian.

714
00:54:06,234 --> 00:54:10,836
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't disagree with Keynesian's theory of borrowing money and doing it.

715
00:54:11,056 --> 00:54:16,758
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do disagree when you borrow money and give it to people who throw $100,000 away and didn't fix the sewer system.

716
00:54:21,702 --> 00:54:25,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Billy Cummings gave him that money, and he'll give it over a few years.

717
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:28,006
[SPEAKER_03]: They could do a little bit more every year.

718
00:54:28,606 --> 00:54:36,051
[SPEAKER_03]: I do agree that a group who wants to raise money doesn't, well, I disagree, I'm sorry.

719
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:37,532
[SPEAKER_03]: I strike that.

720
00:54:38,392 --> 00:54:44,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I disagree with a group who doesn't send out to the community for money from their community, asking them.

721
00:54:45,257 --> 00:54:50,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a letter every once in a while from some Medford group asking me,

722
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,641
[SPEAKER_03]: if you'd like to give.

723
00:54:53,203 --> 00:54:53,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually I do.

724
00:54:54,964 --> 00:55:00,910
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do agree that somebody doesn't know how to raise money on that board.

725
00:55:02,412 --> 00:55:09,559
[SPEAKER_03]: I do agree they don't put in yearly things and yearly reports unless somebody asks for them.

726
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,901
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ask for them.

727
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:21,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Every once in a while, I get three years worth of reports that are made up in 20 minutes by somebody at Brooks Estate.

728
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:22,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know who.

729
00:55:23,107 --> 00:55:23,887
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not signed.

730
00:55:25,928 --> 00:55:35,895
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think mismanagement is a better word to say than any other word for the Brooks Estate board.

731
00:55:36,415 --> 00:55:41,359
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, it wasn't the Brooks Estate who made this a city plan.

732
00:55:42,293 --> 00:55:55,901
[SPEAKER_03]: You're standing here looking at the gentleman who brought the federal government in here and said, this is a city property, and the city needs to take control.

733
00:55:56,162 --> 00:55:57,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did I do that?

734
00:55:57,282 --> 00:56:04,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I didn't want to have to call my senators all the time to get the Brooks Estates board to do what it was supposed to do.

735
00:56:05,688 --> 00:56:11,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, to my understanding, it's almost 10 years that we've been fighting this thing.

736
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:14,594
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen another president change.

737
00:56:15,775 --> 00:56:23,080
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen them invite me in those 10 years to be a member of their board or even a member of their organization.

738
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:33,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, if I wanted to look for an obscure email list or an obscure Facebook list, I might find it.

739
00:56:33,787 --> 00:56:34,808
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not on Facebook.

740
00:56:36,171 --> 00:56:38,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't usually email all that much.

741
00:56:39,452 --> 00:56:43,733
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really have a real problem on your hands.

742
00:56:44,553 --> 00:56:47,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not easy to solve.

743
00:56:47,754 --> 00:56:56,397
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have the authority, according to the management agreement, to dissolve this board.

744
00:56:57,297 --> 00:57:03,799
[SPEAKER_03]: And I suggest you consider that and get back on the right track of negotiating.

745
00:57:04,825 --> 00:57:16,514
[SPEAKER_03]: If they give you any problems, I'd use other words if I was someplace else, I would state, we're going to dissolve your board.

746
00:57:19,076 --> 00:57:28,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to investigate why the city gave people certain rights while they didn't give others the same rights.

747
00:57:29,435 --> 00:57:32,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And you play hardball for a change.

748
00:57:33,398 --> 00:57:36,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Negotiations should come down.

749
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, I'm one of the best negotiators you've ever heard of.

750
00:57:39,342 --> 00:57:43,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I've negotiated some beauts.

751
00:57:43,245 --> 00:57:46,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do it in my own business when I was in business for myself.

752
00:57:47,328 --> 00:57:49,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can do it in the city.

753
00:57:49,409 --> 00:57:52,792
[SPEAKER_03]: The negotiation should end up with a win-win situation.

754
00:57:53,232 --> 00:57:54,753
[SPEAKER_03]: This $24,000 is a win-win situation.

755
00:57:59,405 --> 00:58:00,946
[SPEAKER_03]: It's appropriate.

756
00:58:01,387 --> 00:58:11,615
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for the right of the people to not have to spend $350,000 in one whack, bring back the same group of people.

757
00:58:11,936 --> 00:58:14,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, I own real estate property.

758
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:17,040
[SPEAKER_03]: A tenant at will can leave at any time.

759
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:20,523
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can go to court and take them out.

760
00:58:21,984 --> 00:58:27,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't see why you can't let the city, even though there's a child involved,

761
00:58:29,545 --> 00:58:41,375
[SPEAKER_03]: The court would take the $24,000 as a reasonable amount of money to get that person to leave.

762
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:44,037
[SPEAKER_03]: You might have to throw in a couple months rent.

763
00:58:44,678 --> 00:58:45,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Big deal.

764
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:49,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Over $350,000, and that's only the beginning.

765
00:58:50,222 --> 00:58:55,907
[SPEAKER_03]: You're then going to have to put a sewer system in, because then they're going to come back and extort you for a sewer system.

766
00:58:57,388 --> 00:58:59,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Charlie Morelli did it nicely.

767
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,192
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank the two people here.

768
00:59:03,572 --> 00:59:08,736
[SPEAKER_03]: They were extremely nice about what these people did to you people.

769
00:59:09,496 --> 00:59:16,641
[SPEAKER_03]: If they were in business and I was their board or their leader,

770
00:59:17,711 --> 00:59:20,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd fire every one of them right now.

771
00:59:21,534 --> 00:59:24,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't have done it five years ago, because I had no proof.

772
00:59:24,797 --> 00:59:26,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have the proof.

773
00:59:26,658 --> 00:59:33,184
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the proof of what we've been saying about mismanagement for the last 10 years.

774
00:59:34,245 --> 00:59:36,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can't blame Bob Penter for it.

775
00:59:37,267 --> 00:59:44,113
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't blame anyone in this board for it, because they never came here and told you the problem either.

776
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,384
[SPEAKER_03]: All they did was come in and ask for money after they couldn't raise it.

777
00:59:50,125 --> 00:59:53,229
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't blame any one of you or the council.

778
00:59:53,669 --> 00:59:57,554
[SPEAKER_03]: What you need to do is be hardball in negotiations.

779
00:59:57,834 --> 01:00:00,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank you, but I want to say one more word.

780
01:00:00,918 --> 01:00:02,880
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably my last meeting.

781
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to Florida.

782
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,404
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not my problem anymore.

783
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:16,012
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the person I gave the Brooks Estate 10 years worth of work, done by Mr. Morelli, myself, and my wife, Carolyn Rosen.

784
01:00:16,452 --> 01:00:16,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

785
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:18,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Doctor.

786
01:00:20,073 --> 01:00:20,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

787
01:00:20,634 --> 01:00:22,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

788
01:00:22,354 --> 01:00:24,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Carolyn Rosen, 25 Bustle Road.

789
01:00:25,815 --> 01:00:28,936
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been up here, actually, I have to correct my husband.

790
01:00:28,956 --> 01:00:33,357
[SPEAKER_15]: He was born more than 10 years, because this started back in the early 90s, if I remember.

791
01:00:34,541 --> 01:00:39,003
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can't tell you how many reports we've written on the problems that we've seen.

792
01:00:41,003 --> 01:00:52,747
[SPEAKER_15]: It's ironic that we're up here talking about a historic project that nobody wants to look back on historically in terms of the problems and the train wreck that was going to happen.

793
01:00:54,648 --> 01:00:56,028
[SPEAKER_15]: White people don't want to listen.

794
01:00:58,069 --> 01:01:00,450
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd rather deal with the political process.

795
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:02,851
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd rather propagandize what we're

796
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:10,174
[SPEAKER_15]: small groups are doing in the city, instead of looking at the reality of what actually is happening.

797
01:01:11,314 --> 01:01:26,102
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm here tonight, not just to represent myself as an abutter to the Brooks Estate, who's written numerous reports to you, but to represent my late friend, Charlie Morelli, one of my best friends in the city of Medford when I came here.

798
01:01:26,563 --> 01:01:30,725
[SPEAKER_15]: And I met him through the Brooks Estate argument, back when they were called BIPA.

799
01:01:32,385 --> 01:01:44,488
[SPEAKER_15]: And he predicted to you the problems and the intransigence of the board that was going to take place in running this property, that they would not listen to other people.

800
01:01:44,548 --> 01:01:46,088
[SPEAKER_15]: They would not take feedback.

801
01:01:46,148 --> 01:01:47,529
[SPEAKER_15]: They were not transparent.

802
01:01:47,589 --> 01:01:50,970
[SPEAKER_15]: They would not involve the community in the process.

803
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:55,931
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm here to say tonight, you have no choice but to vote for this $24,000.

804
01:01:56,291 --> 01:02:00,652
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank Mark for getting you out of this.

805
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,941
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was a train wreck about to happen.

806
01:02:06,582 --> 01:02:11,664
[SPEAKER_15]: And now we learned that there was no sewer system, and I live as an abutter in that area.

807
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:18,807
[SPEAKER_15]: So much for the environmentalism and the conservation and the preservation issue.

808
01:02:19,407 --> 01:02:21,048
[SPEAKER_15]: The hypocrisy stinks.

809
01:02:23,749 --> 01:02:32,193
[SPEAKER_15]: But the issue is that the city administration, outside of Mark and Karen Rose, would not hold this group accountable.

810
01:02:33,577 --> 01:02:39,322
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't tell you how many times I ran around and got pushed around and the buck passed from here to here.

811
01:02:39,963 --> 01:02:44,066
[SPEAKER_15]: The budget director, the city clerk, so forth.

812
01:02:44,146 --> 01:02:51,853
[SPEAKER_15]: No one had reports to present that should be transparent to the public in terms of the amount of money they were raising.

813
01:02:52,273 --> 01:02:56,237
[SPEAKER_15]: So you could know whether there was money to cover the $24,000.

814
01:02:58,548 --> 01:03:04,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there director and officers insurance for errors and omissions that would reimburse the city?

815
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:09,352
[SPEAKER_15]: I doubt that, but I've asked the question many times.

816
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:15,774
[SPEAKER_15]: The management agreement requires a $1 million liability policy to cover the city.

817
01:03:17,775 --> 01:03:20,636
[SPEAKER_15]: I've asked how many times over the last 20 years?

818
01:03:21,396 --> 01:03:27,338
[SPEAKER_15]: Where is the certificate of insurance that shows that the city is covered for these liability issues?

819
01:03:30,693 --> 01:03:31,734
[SPEAKER_15]: That did not happen.

820
01:03:32,914 --> 01:03:34,455
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know why it doesn't happen?

821
01:03:35,336 --> 01:03:43,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Because nobody in this country, nobody in this state, nobody on the local level likes to hear criticism.

822
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:46,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody likes to hear skepticism.

823
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:50,486
[SPEAKER_15]: We all want to pretend that everything's nice and positive and rosy.

824
01:03:51,823 --> 01:03:54,985
[SPEAKER_15]: But we sit in a nation of income inequality.

825
01:03:55,586 --> 01:04:13,198
[SPEAKER_15]: We sit in a local city where we have special interest groups that have a little playground that they can play in to create their little political groups to say what wonderful things they're doing in the city and now you're sitting here with a $350,000 disclosed problem and paying $24,000 as extortion to get out of that problem.

826
01:04:20,396 --> 01:04:23,439
[SPEAKER_15]: When are you going to ask the hard questions?

827
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:34,769
[SPEAKER_15]: You have the right under the management agreement, as I have pointed out to you over the years, to call a public hearing to ask for the dismantling of this group.

828
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:47,180
[SPEAKER_15]: You may be able to actually create a project that would be wonderful for the city if you could get out of a transient group, intransigent group.

829
01:04:49,013 --> 01:05:00,402
[SPEAKER_15]: The last report I wrote to this city was to say, when you keep a board of directors, the same people for the same number of years, they get entrenched.

830
01:05:01,003 --> 01:05:10,131
[SPEAKER_15]: They can't see beyond their own personal agenda of what they're trying to accomplish versus what the community tries to get accomplished.

831
01:05:10,851 --> 01:05:13,494
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you need to bring in fresh faces.

832
01:05:14,255 --> 01:05:25,827
[SPEAKER_15]: We cannot talk about the mayor retiring and all the wonderful change that can happen in Medford if we do not look at the grassroots issues where change needs to happen.

833
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:32,535
[SPEAKER_15]: And change needs to happen in the management of the Brooks estate.

834
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:40,622
[SPEAKER_15]: I spent numerous times analyzing what bare financial information I could find.

835
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:56,727
[SPEAKER_15]: I analyzed the capital project that was put forward that a budget director did not tell you had a cash flow problem of a half a million dollars for this city to up front a business that they were trying to sell to the city for a 3.5 million dollar bond.

836
01:05:58,807 --> 01:06:01,268
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you voted it down and rightfully so.

837
01:06:02,655 --> 01:06:04,476
[SPEAKER_15]: But there was no homework done on this.

838
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:07,499
[SPEAKER_15]: I did the homework.

839
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:22,610
[SPEAKER_15]: I took my financial background of 37 years of being a CFO who troubleshoots problem companies and I came in here to the board and I told you, you got a false business plan in front of you.

840
01:06:23,971 --> 01:06:25,392
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a deep hole.

841
01:06:26,593 --> 01:06:28,995
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we wanna see change in Medford,

842
01:06:30,364 --> 01:06:34,167
[SPEAKER_15]: then we need to see change at the grassroots level.

843
01:06:35,068 --> 01:06:42,994
[SPEAKER_15]: There's too much of a pattern here around not-for-profit boards, whether it's TV3 or whether it's MBELT.

844
01:06:43,294 --> 01:06:55,864
[SPEAKER_15]: You get entrenched groups who are here for 20 years and who cannot open their minds to broader community constructive action or community participation.

845
01:06:57,907 --> 01:07:04,671
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's not talk about that hopey-changey thing, because we have to define what hopey-changey is.

846
01:07:06,572 --> 01:07:16,478
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's often not sitting in this room, it's sitting at the grassroots, where people are making politics out of government spending.

847
01:07:17,778 --> 01:07:23,482
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the higher level of the federal government, or even internationally, it's called socialism for the rich.

848
01:07:24,651 --> 01:07:32,496
[SPEAKER_15]: which means you're ripping off the common average citizen for special interest who gets special favors.

849
01:07:33,576 --> 01:07:37,278
[SPEAKER_15]: That's where the change comes and where the change needs to be looked at.

850
01:07:38,399 --> 01:07:43,562
[SPEAKER_15]: And when you find a candidate who will do that, then you certainly will have change in this city.

851
01:07:44,582 --> 01:07:49,405
[SPEAKER_15]: But I've sat here for 20 years talking to you about it, and I'm tired of it.

852
01:07:49,846 --> 01:07:50,506
[SPEAKER_15]: It's boring.

853
01:07:51,448 --> 01:07:52,589
[SPEAKER_15]: because nobody listens.

854
01:07:53,029 --> 01:07:59,213
[SPEAKER_15]: They're too afraid to look at constructive criticism, too afraid to look at skepticism.

855
01:08:01,355 --> 01:08:05,678
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not just the green line in this state that's a train wreck.

856
01:08:06,398 --> 01:08:13,563
[SPEAKER_15]: You gotta look at the local level, how we're spending our government money and not on the priorities and the infrastructure we need to spend it on.

857
01:08:14,938 --> 01:08:19,060
[SPEAKER_15]: And you need to change that board, and you have the ability to do it.

858
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,602
[SPEAKER_15]: And I guarantee you, you won't talk about it again until after the election.

859
01:08:24,042 --> 01:08:24,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

860
01:08:32,466 --> 01:08:33,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

861
01:08:34,567 --> 01:08:34,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

862
01:08:34,787 --> 01:08:36,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Miller, can I ask you a question, please?

863
01:08:43,065 --> 01:08:48,327
[SPEAKER_04]: and all this conversation that we had tonight, something very important was pointed out, and it's the ceiling over there.

864
01:08:48,827 --> 01:08:54,548
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were told months ago that that was going to be fixed, and it's still being covered up.

865
01:08:55,088 --> 01:08:59,150
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a municipal public building where somebody almost got killed when it fell down.

866
01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:00,670
[SPEAKER_04]: When is that ceiling going to be fixed?

867
01:09:01,730 --> 01:09:03,691
[SPEAKER_20]: We hired an architect over the summer.

868
01:09:03,731 --> 01:09:06,892
[SPEAKER_20]: The architect just finished their report, which includes

869
01:09:07,858 --> 01:09:12,741
[SPEAKER_20]: The ceiling in this room as well as the parapet and the roof and other issues.

870
01:09:13,282 --> 01:09:15,043
[SPEAKER_20]: The report was just finished this week.

871
01:09:15,083 --> 01:09:20,747
[SPEAKER_20]: I received it two days ago, and it includes proposals and a budget for the repair work.

872
01:09:20,887 --> 01:09:21,868
[SPEAKER_04]: And how much will the cost be?

873
01:09:22,728 --> 01:09:24,409
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, it includes a budget for the repair work.

874
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:26,651
[SPEAKER_04]: How much is it?

875
01:09:26,671 --> 01:09:31,274
[SPEAKER_20]: I actually honestly don't remember in the book specifically for this.

876
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:33,976
[SPEAKER_20]: I just remember the total amount for all of City Hall.

877
01:09:33,996 --> 01:09:34,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it was.

878
01:09:34,296 --> 01:09:35,177
[SPEAKER_04]: It was mentioned earlier.

879
01:09:36,495 --> 01:09:43,461
[SPEAKER_04]: And because it was mentioned earlier about things that need to be corrected in this community, the city is gonna budget for this, I'm assuming.

880
01:09:43,601 --> 01:09:44,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is that money gonna come from?

881
01:09:44,762 --> 01:09:45,662
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the last question.

882
01:09:46,243 --> 01:09:46,803
[SPEAKER_20]: I do not know.

883
01:09:47,044 --> 01:09:47,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

884
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:55,651
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

885
01:09:55,691 --> 01:09:57,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_06]: vice president occur.

892
01:10:08,439 --> 01:10:09,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Council marks.

893

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

894
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:12,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Penta prison.

895
01:10:12,361 --> 01:10:12,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell her Rousseau.

896
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:13,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

897
01:10:13,561 --> 01:10:18,483
[SPEAKER_07]: With a vote of six and the affirmative one absent, the motion passes.

898
01:10:19,884 --> 01:10:21,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, uh, and the B paper.

899
01:10:24,367 --> 01:10:26,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we have a roll on that?

900
01:10:26,728 --> 01:10:27,548
[SPEAKER_06]: It's up to you.

901
01:10:27,568 --> 01:10:30,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Meeting, future, financial plan, meters.

902
01:10:31,229 --> 01:10:39,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Meeting, the financial reports, meeting with the Board of Health Director, and... The meters and billing.

903
01:10:40,331 --> 01:10:45,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Options.

904
01:10:47,433 --> 01:10:48,254
[SPEAKER_07]: So motioned on.

905
01:10:48,294 --> 01:10:49,674
[SPEAKER_07]: The B paper, all those in favor?

906
01:10:50,614 --> 01:10:52,115
[SPEAKER_07]: All calls have been requested, Mr. Clerk.

907
01:10:52,555 --> 01:10:53,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Please call the roll.

908
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:08,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Camuso?

01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:10,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello?

[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

911
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:12,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

912
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:12,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

913
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:14,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

914
01:11:14,581 --> 01:11:14,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

915

[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks?

916
01:11:16,241 --> 01:11:16,421
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

917
01:11:16,801 --> 01:11:17,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta?

918
01:11:18,882 --> 01:11:19,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

919
01:11:20,362 --> 01:11:21,022
[SPEAKER_06]: President De La Ruza?

920
01:11:21,222 --> 01:11:21,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

921
01:11:21,562 --> 01:11:25,823
[SPEAKER_07]: With a vote of six in the affirmative, one absent, the beat paper passes.

922
01:11:26,423 --> 01:11:29,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll ask Councilor Knight to take two more papers out of order.

923
01:11:33,224 --> 01:11:34,044
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

924
01:11:34,325 --> 01:11:34,985
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

925
01:11:35,005 --> 01:11:35,025
[SPEAKER_07]: 16-693.

926
01:11:37,782 --> 01:11:51,632
[SPEAKER_07]: The Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, from Mayor Michael J. McGlynn, dear Mr. President and councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body- Mr. President, I move to waive the reading, get a brief synopsis from the personnel director.

927
01:11:52,232 --> 01:11:54,113
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could ask Ms.

928
01:11:54,193 --> 01:12:02,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Louise Miller, Director of Personnel, Budget, Finance, and Procurement, et cetera, to give us a synopsis of the matter before us.

929
01:12:04,165 --> 01:12:05,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Point of information, Councilor Penta.

930
01:12:06,286 --> 01:12:07,646
[SPEAKER_04]: When did this vote take place?

931
01:12:08,086 --> 01:12:09,366
[SPEAKER_04]: When did these folks vote on this?

932
01:12:10,707 --> 01:12:13,748
[SPEAKER_20]: They are going to be voting on it this Friday.

933
01:12:14,268 --> 01:12:18,169
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're voting, we're taking a vote on a money matter that hasn't even been voted and accepted.

934
01:12:19,609 --> 01:12:19,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct?

935
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,210
[SPEAKER_20]: They were going to vote last Friday.

936
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:22,710
[SPEAKER_20]: That is correct.

937
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:27,932
[SPEAKER_20]: They were going to vote last Friday and there was a scheduling reason for which they're voting this Friday.

938
01:12:28,072 --> 01:12:32,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the purposes, for the purposes of protocol, this has not been voted upon yet.

939
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:35,424
[SPEAKER_20]: It has not been voted by the DPW Union.

940
01:12:36,245 --> 01:12:37,506
[SPEAKER_20]: It is a ratification.

941
01:12:37,546 --> 01:12:49,575
[SPEAKER_20]: It has been signed, however, by the Teamster Local Union Number 25, Sean O'Brien, President and Principal Officer, and Stephen South, Business Agent, so that the memorandum of agreement is binding.

942
01:12:50,255 --> 01:12:53,358
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be binding, but the members themselves have not voted on this.

943
01:12:53,818 --> 01:12:54,359
[SPEAKER_20]: That's correct.

944
01:12:54,559 --> 01:12:54,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

945
01:12:55,039 --> 01:13:02,105
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, in all fairness, I think this should just lay on the table until they take their vote, and we can just vote on it next week to keep the protocol in order.

946
01:13:04,377 --> 01:13:06,318
[SPEAKER_07]: You were in a point of information council, Penter.

947
01:13:06,378 --> 01:13:06,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a motion?

948
01:13:07,019 --> 01:13:08,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information council, Knight.

949
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:19,625
[SPEAKER_10]: Having some experience in this field, Mr. President, having done this type of work and actually having represented the Medford DPW at the negotiating table in the past, it's interesting the way that this works.

950
01:13:19,685 --> 01:13:24,747
[SPEAKER_10]: But the bargaining team comes to an agreement with the Mays bargaining team.

951
01:13:25,168 --> 01:13:27,349
[SPEAKER_10]: The Mays bargaining team comes to us to fund the contract.

952
01:13:28,249 --> 01:13:31,192
[SPEAKER_10]: The union's bargaining team goes back to the union to ask to ratify it.

953
01:13:32,473 --> 01:13:41,161
[SPEAKER_10]: The members of the bargaining team who sat down and negotiated the contract, negotiated the contract in good faith, Mr. President, they are bound to support it because they agreed at the table.

954
01:13:41,521 --> 01:13:44,344
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't anticipate any problems with the passage of this.

955
01:13:44,404 --> 01:13:46,626
[SPEAKER_10]: I've talked to some of the members of the DPW personally about it.

956
01:13:46,686 --> 01:13:48,127
[SPEAKER_10]: I've gotten calls to support this measure.

957
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:54,311
[SPEAKER_10]: holding it up or voting on it tonight, it's not going to have any difference on the end game.

958
01:13:54,371 --> 01:13:57,992
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not too sure about what protocols and controls that counsel is referring to.

959
01:13:58,032 --> 01:13:59,633
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe if you could clarify, I'd appreciate it.

960
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:01,414
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be making, make it perfectly clear.

961
01:14:01,634 --> 01:14:13,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, number one, if we're asked to being voted upon something for which I'm assuming the folks that work down there, local 25, the union membership, and they haven't yet voted on it, it's just the management or, or, uh,

962
01:14:14,455 --> 01:14:15,496
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a preliminary.

963
01:14:16,036 --> 01:14:16,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

964
01:14:16,656 --> 01:14:18,578
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if everything goes all right, great.

965
01:14:18,658 --> 01:14:23,861
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, why would you vote on something before the membership even had an opportunity to vote it up or down?

966
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:26,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so if you're going to do it, why wouldn't you just do it right?

967
01:14:26,403 --> 01:14:27,463
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what protocol does.

968
01:14:27,503 --> 01:14:28,244
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the process.

969
01:14:28,304 --> 01:14:29,785
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we can make the argument conversely.

970
01:14:29,805 --> 01:14:31,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would they vote on it until we agree that we're going to fund it?

971
01:14:33,913 --> 01:14:41,199
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wouldn't be because every single union contract that's signed here in the city has always been signed after the membership has taken a vote to accept it.

972
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, we're voting on something where they haven't even voted to accept it, but it's just in the works and they probably will.

973
01:14:48,124 --> 01:14:51,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, probably will is not the same as having it in proper form.

974
01:14:51,347 --> 01:14:52,588
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's no protocol, is what I'm saying.

975
01:14:52,608 --> 01:14:53,228
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no protocol.

976
01:14:53,248 --> 01:14:54,209
[SPEAKER_10]: It might be the past practice.

977
01:14:54,249 --> 01:14:58,993
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be what's happened in the past, but there's no protocol, rule, regulation, law, or otherwise that would require someone to do that.

978
01:14:59,453 --> 01:15:01,374
[SPEAKER_07]: The council has a paper before it.

979
01:15:01,475 --> 01:15:03,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

980
01:15:04,997 --> 01:15:11,681
[SPEAKER_23]: If the vote's going to take place this Friday, why don't we table it for one week and take it up next week?

981
01:15:15,484 --> 01:15:16,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a motion?

982
01:15:17,205 --> 01:15:17,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion.

983
01:15:17,926 --> 01:15:22,228
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion to table by Councilor Camuso, which is undebatable, all those in favor?

984
01:15:22,308 --> 01:15:22,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call.

985
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:24,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call has been requested.

986
01:15:30,043 --> 01:15:30,843

01:15:31,003 --> 01:15:31,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:15:32,123 --> 01:15:32,963

989
01:15:33,344 --> 01:15:33,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:15:34,544 --> 01:15:35,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Nance?

991
01:15:35,204 --> 01:15:35,424
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

992

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

994
01:15:38,264 --> 01:15:38,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marx?

995
01:15:39,325 --> 01:15:39,565
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

996
01:15:40,765 --> 01:15:41,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta?

997
01:15:41,445 --> 01:15:41,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

998
01:15:42,225 --> 01:15:43,665
[SPEAKER_06]: President Dello Russo?

999
01:15:44,725 --> 01:15:45,046
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1000
01:15:46,586 --> 01:15:47,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to table fails.

1001
01:15:48,186 --> 01:15:48,646
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it didn't.

1002
01:15:48,686 --> 01:15:49,066
[SPEAKER_04]: It passed 4-3.

1003
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:49,506
[SPEAKER_04]: It passed 4-3.

1004
01:15:49,526 --> 01:15:49,586
[SPEAKER_04]: 4-3.

1005
01:15:49,606 --> 01:15:49,646
[SPEAKER_04]: 4-3.

1006
01:15:49,666 --> 01:15:49,686
[SPEAKER_04]: 4-3.

1007
01:15:49,706 --> 01:15:49,726
[SPEAKER_04]: 4-3.

1008
01:15:49,746 --> 01:15:49,806
[SPEAKER_04]: 4-3.

1009
01:15:49,826 --> 01:15:50,066
[SPEAKER_04]: 4-3.

1010
01:15:50,086 --> 01:15:50,126
[SPEAKER_04]: 4-3.

01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:50,206
[SPEAKER_04]: 4-3.

1012
01:15:50,226 --> 01:15:50,246
[SPEAKER_04]: 4-3.

1013
01:15:50,306 --> 01:15:50,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

1014
01:16:01,462 --> 01:16:03,804
Motion to table pass.

1015
01:16:04,604 --> 01:16:05,725
The matter is tabled.

1016
01:16:05,745 --> 01:16:05,765
15-694.

1017
01:16:05,785 --> 01:16:08,507
In essence, 15-692.

1018
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:08,788
15-694 is?

1019
01:16:08,808 --> 01:16:08,948
Yup.

1020
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:28,583
[SPEAKER_07]: 694 is to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council.

1021
01:16:29,103 --> 01:16:44,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear Mr. President and Councilors, in regards to the paper before you this evening regarding proposed increase in public works personnel and building services personnel, an amendment to Chapter 66 entitled Article 2, Section 66.34, please transfer 16,182 from water retained earnings,

1023
01:17:02,974 --> 01:17:07,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that pertinent to the matter that was tabled previously?

1024
01:17:07,237 --> 01:17:07,798
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, it is.

1025
01:17:08,058 --> 01:17:09,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to table for one week.

1026
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,080

1030
01:17:21,146 --> 01:17:21,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1031
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:23,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello?

1032
01:17:23,127 --> 01:17:23,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1033
01:17:24,027 --> 01:17:24,607
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Nancy?

1034
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:24,888
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1035
01:17:24,908 --> 01:17:26,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Lowenkern?

1036
01:17:26,528 --> 01:17:26,709
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1037
01:17:28,009 --> 01:17:29,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Markswell?

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1041
01:17:31,451 --> 01:17:32,252
[SPEAKER_06]: President Dello Russo?

1042
01:17:32,472 --> 01:17:32,672
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1043
01:17:33,412 --> 01:17:34,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Vote 4-3.

1044
01:17:34,133 --> 01:17:36,374
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're under suspension.

1045
01:17:36,394 --> 01:17:39,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Miller.

1046
01:17:50,273 --> 01:17:53,258
[SPEAKER_07]: 15-692, offered by President De La Russa.

1047
01:17:54,459 --> 01:18:01,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that Roberta Cameron update the council on the Community Preservation Act ballot initiative.

1048
01:18:03,252 --> 01:18:03,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome, Ms.

1049
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:04,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Cameron.

1050
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:05,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

1051
01:18:06,221 --> 01:18:09,503
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to all of you for inviting me to come and provide an update.

1052
01:18:10,083 --> 01:18:23,973
[SPEAKER_12]: As you know, over the summer, a collection of signatures was taken up to put on the ballot for this November the Community Preservation Act for the city to adopt the Community Preservation Act.

1053
01:18:24,353 --> 01:18:28,476
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a state program that enables cities and towns to

1054
01:18:29,397 --> 01:18:36,169
[SPEAKER_12]: collect revenue, especially for open space, recreation facilities, historic preservation, and affordable housing.

1055
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:42,941
[SPEAKER_12]: And these funds are going to be collected through a very small surcharge on local property taxes.

1056
01:18:43,532 --> 01:18:56,921
[SPEAKER_12]: which I will explain further and will be partially matched with state funding that right now we are paying into the state's Community Preservation Act Trust Fund, but we're not receiving any funds from that.

1057
01:18:57,321 --> 01:19:04,666
[SPEAKER_12]: So this question on the ballot is intended to give MEDD for the opportunity to take part in this program.

1058
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:09,830
[SPEAKER_12]: So the surcharge on the local property tax amounts to 1.5% of the property tax bills

1059
01:19:13,475 --> 01:19:21,985
[SPEAKER_12]: for all residential and commercial properties after exempting the first $100,000 value in properties.

1060
01:19:22,286 --> 01:19:27,172
[SPEAKER_12]: We estimate that for the average residential property in the city that's valued at $400,000, this amounts to $53 a year.

1061
01:19:31,941 --> 01:19:32,902
[SPEAKER_12]: in surcharge.

1062
01:19:33,242 --> 01:19:51,935
[SPEAKER_12]: And this funding, the $53 a year adds up to approximately $1 million in revenue that the city will generate of local funding that will pay for open space, recreation facilities, historic preservation, and affordable housing.

1063
01:19:52,435 --> 01:19:55,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Facilities such as City Hall, the repairs that are needed,

1064
01:19:56,368 --> 01:20:17,396
[SPEAKER_12]: the library, Chevalier Theater, our historic fire stations, the Brooks Estate, many of our public buildings that are in need of repairs could qualify to be funded with this funding as well as with the state funds that would come in addition.

1065
01:20:18,536 --> 01:20:23,198
[SPEAKER_12]: There are exemptions that are written into the petition

1066
01:20:23,722 --> 01:20:34,665
[SPEAKER_12]: that include low and moderate income seniors and low income homeowners could apply for an exemption from the surcharge.

1067
01:20:34,845 --> 01:20:43,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Low and moderate income is according to HUD definitions, which right now for a household of two, a low income household earns close to $70,000 a year.

1068
01:20:47,383 --> 01:20:57,386
[SPEAKER_12]: I think a significant number of people who would find this surcharge to be a hardship could apply for an exemption from the CPA surcharge.

1069
01:20:58,347 --> 01:21:15,232
[SPEAKER_12]: I would just like to let you know that there is further information available about the Community Preservation Act, both from the website that we've set up, which is www.preservemedford.org.

1070
01:21:16,858 --> 01:21:21,282
[SPEAKER_12]: And there is also information available.

1071
01:21:21,342 --> 01:21:32,952
[SPEAKER_12]: The Community Preservation Coalition maintains technical assistance for communities that are using the Community Preservation Act and communities that are considering it.

1072
01:21:33,052 --> 01:21:39,198
[SPEAKER_12]: And they maintain a database of all of the projects that have ever been funded with the Community Preservation Act.

1073
01:21:39,638 --> 01:21:41,920
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a lot of transparency to this program.

1074
01:21:42,427 --> 01:22:10,806
[SPEAKER_12]: The funds would be spent each year through the oversight of a committee that would be appointed with representatives from the Housing Commission, the Conservation Commission, the Redevelopment Board, the Parks Commission, and additional members that can be defined by an ordinance of our own so that we can establish our own criteria of what kinds of projects we would consider for funding each year.

1075
01:22:14,057 --> 01:22:25,099
[SPEAKER_12]: Further, I want to ensure that voters all have the opportunity to learn about the Community Preservation Act, to learn about question one on the ballot.

1076
01:22:25,719 --> 01:22:33,121
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would entertain any suggestions about how we can best reach out to voters in the short time that is available before the election.

1077
01:22:35,521 --> 01:22:36,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions?

1078
01:22:38,602 --> 01:22:40,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lugolkart.

1079
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:42,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1080
01:22:42,966 --> 01:22:45,826
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to thank Roberta Cameron for being here.

1081
01:22:47,007 --> 01:22:56,009
[SPEAKER_18]: You have people in Medford from, you know, people talking about it, because we see you, we saw you everywhere this summer trying to collect signatures, and I, you know, I think that was a great endeavor.

1082
01:22:56,029 --> 01:23:02,611
[SPEAKER_18]: And just me as a Councilor kind of stayed out of the pro cons, but I would talk to people about it.

1083
01:23:02,671 --> 01:23:08,353
[SPEAKER_18]: And one of the main concerns was whether they were pro or for it, mostly the cons.

1084
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:14,801
[SPEAKER_18]: They didn't have enough information on it, so I think it's good that you brought to light, you know, came in front of the council and discussed it.

1085
01:23:16,882 --> 01:23:38,387
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may just point out, the questions that we've received from people who we've talked to about this over time, we research the answers and on our website there's an FAQ page which we update regularly with answers to actually frequently asked questions or questions that we've ever been asked about the Community Preservation Act.

1086
01:23:39,349 --> 01:23:43,531
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you could just outline each individual way that somebody could learn more.

1087
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:54,897
[SPEAKER_18]: So you have the www.preservemedford.org and then what other types of media outlets have you reached out to or where else can somebody go to get the questions answered if they need them answered?

1088
01:23:55,157 --> 01:24:03,701
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, the Community Preservation Coalition is our greatest resource for information about the Community Preservation Act.

1089
01:24:03,761 --> 01:24:07,623
[SPEAKER_12]: They've been helping communities administer it since it was passed in 2000.

1090
01:24:09,235 --> 01:24:26,566
[SPEAKER_12]: about half of the communities in the state up to this time, and that's every kind of community from large cities to very small towns, suburbs, urban, all kinds of communities are participating in this because they find that there are projects that they can only fund through these types of funds.

1091
01:24:27,906 --> 01:24:38,773
[SPEAKER_12]: And so Community Preservation Coalition has been providing assistance to help them understand how to apply it properly and legally

1092
01:24:39,652 --> 01:24:47,279
[SPEAKER_12]: and keep track of what communities are doing to give other communities ideas of what are fundable projects and how to use it.

1093
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:54,545
[SPEAKER_18]: And then with regards to the flyer, I think you gave us this flyer when you met with us in the Committee of the Whole meeting a few months ago.

1094
01:24:55,089 --> 01:25:00,291
[SPEAKER_18]: And this was a great tool for me to really, I mean, it's what you just spoke about and then some.

1095
01:25:00,351 --> 01:25:03,712
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I mean, if somebody wanted to get a flyer, are you handing them out anywhere?

1096
01:25:03,852 --> 01:25:07,433
[SPEAKER_12]: We're trying to hand them out in every place that we can get to.

1097
01:25:07,633 --> 01:25:10,254
[SPEAKER_12]: There are also flyers available at the library.

1098
01:25:10,274 --> 01:25:11,574
[SPEAKER_12]: At the library.

1099
01:25:11,614 --> 01:25:11,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1100
01:25:12,174 --> 01:25:24,858
[SPEAKER_07]: And the chair wishes to point out that this is an informational moment to explain that this ballot initiative is on the ballot, but we always want to be conscious of this, uh,

1101
01:25:25,282 --> 01:25:31,724
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity that we not make it into one that one could feel that electioneering is going on.

1102
01:25:34,084 --> 01:25:35,145
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have no questions.

1103
01:25:35,185 --> 01:25:38,846
[SPEAKER_18]: I think a lot of the questions I had were answered in the committee, the whole meeting.

1104
01:25:39,106 --> 01:25:46,148
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, but I just want to make sure the public has enough information out there that they can read about it, understand what's, what's going to happen, whether or not it passes.

1105
01:25:46,728 --> 01:25:50,109
[SPEAKER_18]: And, um, if it does pass, that's the questions I've been hearing from people.

1106
01:25:50,169 --> 01:25:53,850
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's good that you're here and it's great that you have, we have some avenues to,

1107
01:25:54,722 --> 01:25:56,384
[SPEAKER_18]: get the information out.

1108
01:25:56,464 --> 01:25:56,764
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1109
01:25:57,104 --> 01:25:57,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1110
01:25:57,705 --> 01:25:59,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1111
01:25:59,706 --> 01:26:00,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1112
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:02,629
[SPEAKER_10]: And Roberta, thank you for being here this evening.

1113
01:26:03,289 --> 01:26:11,957
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to thank you for taking the time to come up here and help educate the electorate about this question that's going to be on the ballot, because there have been a number of questions and concerns about it.

1114
01:26:11,977 --> 01:26:13,218
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a rather lengthy question.

1115
01:26:13,258 --> 01:26:15,880
[SPEAKER_10]: It sometimes can be interpreted as confusing.

1116
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:18,762
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you very much for coming out here this evening.

1117
01:26:18,782 --> 01:26:21,224
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to echo your sentiments, Councilor Caraviello,

1118
01:26:22,025 --> 01:26:31,871
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, this is a presentation that's informative in nature to educate the electorate of what the question will be on the ballot and not really to debate the merits of the question and have a vote on it here this evening.

1119
01:26:32,152 --> 01:26:33,452
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to be left for November 3rd.

1120
01:26:33,873 --> 01:26:36,254
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that being said, I just really want to thank you for your work.

1121
01:26:36,294 --> 01:26:43,499
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to congratulate you and your team for their efforts on being able to acquire the number of signatures to get the question on the ballot, because that was a heavy lift.

1122
01:26:43,519 --> 01:26:46,581
[SPEAKER_10]: That was really quite an endeavor, and you guys pulled it off.

1123
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:49,183
[SPEAKER_10]: So congratulations, and I wish you guys the best of luck on November 3rd.

1124
01:26:49,523 --> 01:26:49,823
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1125
01:26:50,629 --> 01:26:53,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1126
01:26:53,712 --> 01:26:57,997
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to commend you on your monumental task of getting all those signatures.

1127
01:26:58,717 --> 01:27:06,565
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the questions I'm being asked by people is, what happens if the state funding starts to dry up for this?

1128
01:27:07,126 --> 01:27:08,027
[SPEAKER_19]: What is our obligation?

1129
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:12,524
[SPEAKER_12]: There are two answers to that question.

1130
01:27:12,964 --> 01:27:27,795
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, if we, after the initial passing of the Community Preservation Act by a community, the community does not make any further changes, cannot make any further changes for five years.

1131
01:27:28,336 --> 01:27:38,464
[SPEAKER_12]: After five years, they can change the amount of the surcharge, change other details, the exemptions and other details about their CPA

1132
01:27:40,437 --> 01:27:47,941
[SPEAKER_12]: law, and secondly, or they could vote to eliminate CPA if they were unhappy with it.

1133
01:27:48,041 --> 01:27:52,203
[SPEAKER_12]: So far, communities have not been- Would that take another ballot question?

1134
01:27:52,423 --> 01:27:56,965
[SPEAKER_12]: It would require another vote in the general election to make any changes.

1135
01:27:57,365 --> 01:28:07,210
[SPEAKER_12]: So we cannot raise or lower the percentage of the tax bill without going to the voters, and we can't eliminate it without going to the voters.

1136
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:10,691
[SPEAKER_12]: and any changes would have to take place after five years.

1137
01:28:11,112 --> 01:28:22,917
[SPEAKER_12]: But to answer the other point of your question about what if there is no state funding, so far the state funding has been continued and there is not any sign that they're going to discontinue the current sources of funding.

1138
01:28:22,957 --> 01:28:27,520
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some question as to whether they are going to add additional funding.

1139
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:33,602
[SPEAKER_19]: The reason I ask that is I was at a breakfast with Lieutenant Governor Polito last week and that question was asked.

1140
01:28:35,007 --> 01:28:42,169
[SPEAKER_19]: She didn't say that the governor was not going to fund it, but as more and more communities join in on it, the pool is going to start drying up.

1141
01:28:42,989 --> 01:28:50,232
[SPEAKER_12]: In recent years, it has ranged from 30 to 50 percent, typically, of state funding to local funding.

1142
01:28:50,632 --> 01:29:01,135
[SPEAKER_12]: We estimate that the city of Medford, at the level that is on the ballot, could generate $1 million a year in local revenues, and if that's matched,

1143
01:29:02,495 --> 01:29:05,497
[SPEAKER_12]: $300,000 a year in state revenue, that's wonderful.

1144
01:29:05,997 --> 01:29:23,605
[SPEAKER_12]: If that isn't matched, $300,000 a year in state revenue, we still have gained a million dollars a year in local revenue raised through the city of Medford that will benefit our historic public buildings, our parks, and our recreation facilities.

1145
01:29:25,606 --> 01:29:26,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1146
01:29:26,407 --> 01:29:27,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1147
01:29:27,507 --> 01:29:29,288
[SPEAKER_07]: The Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

1148
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:40,844
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for your monumental efforts to get this on the ballot, because definitely there is pros and cons of this as we speak to different people throughout the community.

1149
01:29:41,384 --> 01:29:48,607
[SPEAKER_23]: So there's no better way than to get an actual gauge than to have people actually participate and take that vote.

1150
01:29:50,327 --> 01:29:57,290
[SPEAKER_23]: Coincidentally, Governor Baker this morning was in the Great Hall up at the Statehouse, and he was

1151
01:29:58,282 --> 01:30:04,286
[SPEAKER_23]: having a little gathering to celebrate the 15th year anniversary of the signing of the original bill.

1152
01:30:04,306 --> 01:30:07,468
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe it was on the Governor Salucci back in 02?

1153
01:30:08,448 --> 01:30:08,768
[SPEAKER_23]: Swift.

1154
01:30:08,808 --> 01:30:09,629
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, Governor Swift.

1155
01:30:09,649 --> 01:30:10,149
[SPEAKER_23]: That's correct.

1156
01:30:10,189 --> 01:30:11,910
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, 2001.

1157
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:12,531
[SPEAKER_23]: Governor Swift.

1158
01:30:12,771 --> 01:30:16,093
[SPEAKER_23]: So that took place earlier today up at the Statehouse.

1159
01:30:16,553 --> 01:30:26,439
[SPEAKER_23]: But with that being said, I actually look forward to the results of this portion of the ballot question that's going to take place in November, because it's certainly going to tell

1160
01:30:28,857 --> 01:30:45,992
[SPEAKER_23]: the elected officials moving forward, where the interests are, I think, throughout the community as a whole, if people are behind the Brooks Estate, say, that we just discussed, or behind other areas like the Royal House that would be eligible for funding.

1161
01:30:46,472 --> 01:30:54,780
[SPEAKER_23]: So it may give a better picture moving forward on moving certain projects forward and maybe not so much as well.

1162
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:55,961
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think that the

1163
01:30:57,115 --> 01:31:01,518
[SPEAKER_23]: The results will be indicative on where people want this community to go.

1164
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:05,260
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm looking forward to that as a bigger piece of the whole picture.

1165
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:10,623
[SPEAKER_23]: But like I said, I just want to thank you for your commitment to get the signatures.

1166
01:31:10,663 --> 01:31:19,548
[SPEAKER_23]: I know often over the last 16 years as an elected official here in our community, we often heard people say, we're going to get the signatures and we're going to put this on the ballot and this and this and that.

1167
01:31:20,203 --> 01:31:22,125
[SPEAKER_23]: And it really never comes to fruition.

1168
01:31:22,625 --> 01:31:25,828
[SPEAKER_23]: But you and other members of the public out here.

1169
01:31:25,848 --> 01:31:26,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1170
01:31:26,088 --> 01:31:28,430
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to acknowledge that it's a lot of teamwork.

1171
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:29,471
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

1172
01:31:30,552 --> 01:31:36,256
[SPEAKER_23]: I must have seen Mimi more over the past two months than I've seen her in a few years.

1173
01:31:36,316 --> 01:31:41,721
[SPEAKER_23]: I think since Tom Birmingham's election, way back when, when she was a big shot at the SEIU.

1174
01:31:42,181 --> 01:31:45,604
[SPEAKER_23]: But with that being said, I just want to thank you all for your effort.

1175
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:47,746
[SPEAKER_23]: And I look forward to

1176
01:31:48,206 --> 01:31:55,350
[SPEAKER_23]: working with you, whatever way this goes, at least for a month or so, because I'll be retiring at the end of December.

1177
01:31:55,590 --> 01:31:57,151
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you.

1178
01:31:57,191 --> 01:31:57,612
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1179
01:31:57,652 --> 01:31:58,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1180
01:31:58,252 --> 01:31:58,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1181
01:31:58,852 --> 01:32:00,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

1182
01:32:01,074 --> 01:32:08,618
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what's interesting about this when it first came up in 2001, I was the only council that supported not only support it, but support putting it on the ballot.

1183
01:32:09,578 --> 01:32:13,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, the council at that time voted six to one not to do that.

1184
01:32:13,561 --> 01:32:14,822
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we are to new day.

1185
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:15,362
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a new day.

1186
01:32:15,382 --> 01:32:15,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Done.

1187
01:32:15,915 --> 01:32:25,781
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the part that's been most concerning by people who have a question is, once this is voted upon, how is the committee formed?

1188
01:32:26,561 --> 01:32:32,505
[SPEAKER_04]: Who makes up the committee and who makes the determination of what and how the percentage is going to be?

1189
01:32:32,565 --> 01:32:35,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's the big cloud in the sky.

1190
01:32:36,327 --> 01:32:37,307
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a great question.

1191
01:32:39,460 --> 01:33:02,225
[SPEAKER_12]: The state statute establishes that there would be five members that they assign from existing boards around the city that include the Housing Commission, the Conservation Commission, the Community Development Board,

1192
01:33:02,982 --> 01:33:05,824
[SPEAKER_12]: the parks board and the historical commission.

1193
01:33:06,584 --> 01:33:25,998
[SPEAKER_12]: And up to four additional members could be appointed and it would be up to the city of Medford through an ordinance that would be drafted by the city council, perhaps with the input of members of the public and other city officials to determine who those other four people could be.

1194
01:33:26,058 --> 01:33:30,360
[SPEAKER_12]: They could be at large members, they could be appointees from other boards and et cetera.

1195
01:33:30,861 --> 01:33:32,462
[SPEAKER_12]: And that, that committee,

1196
01:33:32,932 --> 01:34:01,552
[SPEAKER_12]: could have the potential to undertake a yearly planning process to set out what are the community priorities for funding that year so that they get input from all of the various interests throughout the city to establish what weight is given to either of those program areas or within those program areas, what are the most important types of projects that we are looking at in a given year.

1197
01:34:02,048 --> 01:34:14,331
[SPEAKER_12]: And then projects would be selected from proposals that are received each year from the city departments, from community partners that have responsibility for our assets.

1198
01:34:14,451 --> 01:34:18,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this was the question that came off of that.

1199
01:34:18,912 --> 01:34:22,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the mayor of the community who sets up the appointments and makes these appointments?

1200
01:34:22,893 --> 01:34:23,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it doesn't say.

1201
01:34:23,873 --> 01:34:24,713
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't say.

1202
01:34:24,733 --> 01:34:25,894
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't say who the appoint.

1203
01:34:25,914 --> 01:34:31,895
[SPEAKER_12]: The city council is going to write an ordinance that establishes what that process will be for Medford.

1204
01:34:32,392 --> 01:34:35,474
[SPEAKER_12]: So the state has not prescribed how it works.

1205
01:34:35,894 --> 01:34:39,796
[SPEAKER_12]: The city will have the opportunity to decide how we want it to work.

1206
01:34:40,297 --> 01:34:45,420
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you say that, and let's just say the community votes to accept the community preservation act.

1207
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:45,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1208
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:53,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you saying from your understanding, it would be up to the city council to make this determination on who gets appointed?

1209
01:34:53,785 --> 01:34:54,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1210
01:34:54,625 --> 01:34:56,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'd be up to the city council to write the ordinance.

1211
01:34:57,407 --> 01:35:01,309
[SPEAKER_12]: The city council would write the ordinance hopefully with the input of

1212
01:35:02,245 --> 01:35:19,196
[SPEAKER_04]: public and what's the time sequence after let's just say it's on the ballot this November 3rd and it gets approved what's the time sequence that this has to take place I would have to go to our technical assistance and I think you know if you could come back and give us that answer because that's a question that's out there number one and number two

1213
01:35:20,767 --> 01:35:29,389
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody is going to vote for the Community Preservation Act, and I believe it's touting around 1.5%, is that the one?

1214
01:35:29,409 --> 01:35:29,389
1.5%.

1215
01:35:29,689 --> 01:35:30,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1216
01:35:30,489 --> 01:35:34,790
[SPEAKER_04]: But they don't know where it's going, and they're not going to know until after they vote for it.

1217
01:35:36,170 --> 01:35:44,012
[SPEAKER_04]: How is the community getting the input of saying, this is where, that's why I'm voting for this on November 3rd, because this is where the money's going.

1218
01:35:44,252 --> 01:35:44,852
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like,

1219
01:35:46,288 --> 01:35:49,989
[SPEAKER_04]: show me first, and then give me the money, and then I'll show you first after the fact.

1220
01:35:50,469 --> 01:35:54,171
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the two questions that I can't answer, so maybe you can answer it.

1221
01:35:55,031 --> 01:36:01,553
[SPEAKER_12]: There will be an open public process that will determine what our community preservation plan would be.

1222
01:36:01,613 --> 01:36:06,795
[SPEAKER_12]: The community preservation plan is that guide for what our priorities are for funding in a given year.

1223
01:36:07,655 --> 01:36:11,576
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's numerous wish lists out there.

1224
01:36:11,616 --> 01:36:14,057
[SPEAKER_12]: We have our open space and recreation plan

1225
01:36:14,595 --> 01:36:18,259
[SPEAKER_12]: that establishes an already very widely available wish list.

1226
01:36:18,919 --> 01:36:23,544
[SPEAKER_12]: And the historical commission can tell us what some of their top priority concerns are.

1227
01:36:25,746 --> 01:36:30,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Your municipal buildings obviously have numerous needs.

1228
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:34,414
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure that you have a capital improvement plan that tells you what those needs are now.

1229
01:36:34,935 --> 01:36:37,297
[SPEAKER_12]: But those are examples of where the

1230
01:36:38,732 --> 01:36:45,457
[SPEAKER_12]: what types of projects might be included in the plan for community preservation funding.

1231
01:36:45,817 --> 01:36:50,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is over a five year period of time because you own it for five years, the first five years, correct?

1232
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:50,921
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1233
01:36:51,041 --> 01:36:56,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, can you change each and every year, change a different subject to have that money go to?

1234
01:36:56,765 --> 01:36:57,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just say you want to do the library.

1235
01:36:57,986 --> 01:37:00,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you stuck with the library for five consecutive years?

1236
01:37:01,789 --> 01:37:05,672
[SPEAKER_12]: A community preservation plan, I think, is something that we could undertake annually.

1237
01:37:06,662 --> 01:37:12,564
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not a specific five-year period that we plan ahead for what our priorities are.

1238
01:37:13,064 --> 01:37:25,068
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that the city will have the ability to decide, perhaps in an ordinance established by the city council, the city will have the opportunity to decide what is our process for evaluating our priorities.

1239
01:37:25,453 --> 01:37:29,256
[SPEAKER_04]: So on an annual basis, you can change the money during the course of that five years.

1240
01:37:29,496 --> 01:37:29,716
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1241
01:37:30,076 --> 01:37:31,997
[SPEAKER_12]: So we collect a certain amount of money.

1242
01:37:32,057 --> 01:37:38,662
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what the voters have on the ballot this year is the amount of money that that can be collected.

1243
01:37:38,982 --> 01:37:48,888
[SPEAKER_12]: But how the money is allocated between our local priorities, that is something that's to be determined by the committee that will be appointed afterward.

1244
01:37:49,489 --> 01:37:53,752
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last question, Mr. President, is if I understand reading

1245
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:55,541
[SPEAKER_04]: the synopsis of it.

1246
01:37:56,101 --> 01:38:01,726
[SPEAKER_04]: If a board or a commission doesn't exist, you can create a new board or commission to put this money.

1247
01:38:02,527 --> 01:38:05,330
[SPEAKER_04]: And secondly, it uses the term housing authority.

1248
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:10,914
[SPEAKER_04]: And since this council has no authority over the Medford Housing Authority, that was a question that's been presented.

1249
01:38:10,955 --> 01:38:12,816
[SPEAKER_04]: So where do we go with that one?

1250
01:38:15,058 --> 01:38:19,162
[SPEAKER_12]: We request that a member of the housing authority

1251
01:38:19,883 --> 01:38:26,266
[SPEAKER_12]: or somebody who is appointed by the housing authority sit on the commission that will oversee this funding.

1252
01:38:26,966 --> 01:38:41,753
[SPEAKER_12]: To date, I asked the Community Preservation Coalition whether they've had issues with the decision of the committee not being respected after they determine funding allocations.

1253
01:38:41,813 --> 01:38:44,375
[SPEAKER_12]: They have not seen that occur in other cities and towns.

1254
01:38:44,455 --> 01:38:47,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Because of the open public process, there's

1255
01:38:50,046 --> 01:39:03,894
[SPEAKER_12]: a strong preference for the funding to be allocated in the way that's recommended through the public process and through the vetting process of what are legally allowable expenditures of the funds.

1256
01:39:04,874 --> 01:39:18,282
[SPEAKER_12]: And there haven't, to their knowledge, been difficulties with the committees, including the representation that's specified by the state law.

1257
01:39:19,534 --> 01:39:33,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And if, in fact, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts cannot meet its obligation financially, and I think as we had this discussion before, I think what's been appropriated so far for this year is an 18% money back to the cities and towns.

1258
01:39:34,819 --> 01:39:45,382
[SPEAKER_04]: If the city of Medford for the next five years, let's just say, once the committee's all formed and you set up some parameters and some programs, can one year, let's just say, be for the library?

1259
01:39:45,402 --> 01:39:48,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Can one year could be for maintenance for the schools?

1260
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:56,258
[SPEAKER_04]: For the next five years while we own this CPA, can each and every year have a different designation for those monies to go to?

1261
01:39:57,213 --> 01:40:13,222
[SPEAKER_12]: The statute requires that 10% of funds each year be set aside for each of three program areas, that is affordable housing, historic preservation, and open space and recreation combined.

1262
01:40:13,242 --> 01:40:17,445
[SPEAKER_12]: And so beyond that 10%, 70% is at our discretion.

1263
01:40:17,585 --> 01:40:21,507
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can put up to 80% in any one of those program areas each year.

1264
01:40:22,868 --> 01:40:23,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1265
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:27,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1266
01:40:27,201 --> 01:40:29,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Roberta, for appearing tonight and explaining this.

1267
01:40:31,365 --> 01:40:40,414
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if you can answer it or not, but in any fiscal year, does the money, the revenue have to be expended in that fiscal year or could it be carried over?

1268
01:40:40,715 --> 01:40:41,656
[SPEAKER_12]: It can be carried over.

1269
01:40:42,256 --> 01:40:48,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Some communities choose to carry it over because they don't have an eligible project that year in that program area.

1270
01:40:49,552 --> 01:40:56,620
[SPEAKER_12]: or because they are saving up for a bigger project than what one year's worth of revenue will cover.

1271
01:40:57,461 --> 01:40:57,701
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

1272
01:40:58,202 --> 01:41:00,745
[SPEAKER_14]: And you also mentioned about exemptions.

1273
01:41:01,605 --> 01:41:09,915
[SPEAKER_14]: And the million dollar estimate that you gave at the beginning, based on the average household income and so forth,

1274
01:41:12,532 --> 01:41:19,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that taking into consideration the exemptions that are out there, or is this million dollars over and above?

1275
01:41:20,377 --> 01:41:30,122
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have any way of estimating the number of people who will apply to take an exemption from the Community Preservation Act surcharge.

1276
01:41:30,683 --> 01:41:36,006
[SPEAKER_12]: However, based on the total number of properties in the city,

1277
01:41:36,787 --> 01:41:49,033
[SPEAKER_12]: And the total valuation, taking $100,000 out for each number of parcels that receive a tax bill, we came to $1.1 million.

1278
01:41:50,473 --> 01:42:00,818
[SPEAKER_12]: And so rounding down to $1 million, there's a margin of error, but that seems to be a reasonable number to land on.

1279
01:42:03,023 --> 01:42:12,186
[SPEAKER_14]: And just my last question is, you explained the process of getting approval for the different projects.

1280
01:42:13,147 --> 01:42:16,588
[SPEAKER_14]: Ultimately, it comes for a final vote before the council.

1281
01:42:16,648 --> 01:42:17,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that how it works?

1282
01:42:17,948 --> 01:42:18,168
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1283
01:42:19,869 --> 01:42:24,891
[SPEAKER_14]: And do you know if it requires a two-thirds vote or majority?

1284
01:42:25,431 --> 01:42:28,152
[SPEAKER_12]: That's beyond my level of expertise.

1285
01:42:28,212 --> 01:42:31,413
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd have to consult with the Community Preservation Coalition.

1286
01:42:32,707 --> 01:42:41,115
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1287
01:42:41,836 --> 01:42:42,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1288
01:42:45,799 --> 01:42:46,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Ask a question or two.

1289
01:42:47,321 --> 01:42:54,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, we remind you that, uh, uh, Councilor Knight, um, Roberta, could you tell us,

1290
01:42:55,410 --> 01:43:02,775
[SPEAKER_09]: What a yes vote means and what a no vote means on the question, sometimes these ballot questions are worded in a way where a no vote means yes and a yes vote means no.

1291
01:43:03,235 --> 01:43:09,180
[SPEAKER_09]: So would a vote on question one mean a vote to adopt the Community Preservation Act and a no vote would mean to not adopt the Community Preservation Act?

1292
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:09,840
[SPEAKER_12]: That's correct.

1293
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:10,100
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1294
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:10,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1295
01:43:10,681 --> 01:43:11,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilman.

1296
01:43:13,563 --> 01:43:13,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

1297
01:43:13,963 --> 01:43:15,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1298
01:43:15,944 --> 01:43:16,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Carolyn Rosen, 25 Bustle Road.

1299
01:43:18,903 --> 01:43:24,607
[SPEAKER_15]: As I spoke about earlier, this is where criticism and skepticism comes into play.

1300
01:43:25,087 --> 01:43:34,953
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to give Mr. Lepore a report called the Massachusetts Community Preservation Act, Who Benefits, Who Pays.

1301
01:43:36,594 --> 01:43:45,540
[SPEAKER_15]: As a person who's very strongly into affordable housing, I thought this might be a nice way to get affordable housing in the city.

1302
01:43:46,082 --> 01:43:49,023
[SPEAKER_15]: to stabilize some of the rising prices that we're seeing.

1303
01:43:49,703 --> 01:44:05,609
[SPEAKER_15]: But in doing a lot of research on this many years ago, as well as most recently, I don't think it's as transparent as public or socially equitable as presented by the proponents.

1304
01:44:07,905 --> 01:44:11,787
[SPEAKER_15]: You need to understand as a public, you're paying a tax on a tax.

1305
01:44:12,488 --> 01:44:22,074
[SPEAKER_15]: So basically you paid registry of deed fees, now you're paying a surcharge to access registry of deed fees that you paid to put on your property tax.

1306
01:44:22,974 --> 01:44:29,798
[SPEAKER_15]: And even though they talk about it as you pay about $40 or $50 a year on your property tax at 1.5%, your property tax raises every year.

1307
01:44:34,371 --> 01:44:37,973
[SPEAKER_15]: usually you know that in December, so that $50 fee can raise up.

1308
01:44:38,393 --> 01:44:51,379
[SPEAKER_15]: And for some people, that could be deciding whether you wanna pay your increase, 21% increase of projecting in your electric bill versus having to pay a surcharge on your property tax.

1309
01:44:52,159 --> 01:45:00,983
[SPEAKER_15]: But what the Rappaport report talks about is a lack of transparency and a lack of equity in how the CPA is actually handled.

1310
01:45:02,509 --> 01:45:09,591
[SPEAKER_15]: And what they mean is, and I think Councilor Penta hit the issue correctly, is the devil's in the details.

1311
01:45:09,952 --> 01:45:14,373
[SPEAKER_15]: So you won't know if you vote for it what the ordinance is gonna require.

1312
01:45:15,453 --> 01:45:31,219
[SPEAKER_15]: And when they say 10% will go to affordable housing, 10% to open space, 10% to historical preservation, well there's that big 70% gap of discretionary spending that a small group of people

1313
01:45:31,737 --> 01:45:38,418
[SPEAKER_15]: are gonna decide what projects get done in the city, and you'll be trapped in that for the next five years if you vote for it.

1314
01:45:39,259 --> 01:45:47,661
[SPEAKER_15]: What the Rappaport has found, and Tufts in a subsequent report to this has also found, very little affordable housing comes out of this act.

1315
01:45:48,501 --> 01:45:55,802
[SPEAKER_15]: And when the proponent was talking about the Community Preservation Act, you'll notice in her wording she was talking about open space and preservation.

1316
01:45:56,442 --> 01:45:58,503
[SPEAKER_15]: Very little was said about affordable housing.

1317
01:45:59,691 --> 01:46:19,858
[SPEAKER_15]: So what happens is you won't know whether you're gonna have a full support appointed board which becomes more of a political process than if it just becomes more of a full process that comes to the city through the current process of a more democratic open process.

1318
01:46:20,858 --> 01:46:26,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, you're talking to this group about how do they educate the public about the CPA

1319
01:46:27,464 --> 01:46:29,825
[SPEAKER_15]: and better ways to do that, to educate people.

1320
01:46:30,545 --> 01:46:44,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, imagine you have a nine-person board who's going to decide what projects get done in the city of Medford, and we're already just talking about how you can get broader communication and participation by the city.

1321
01:46:44,571 --> 01:46:50,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Imagine what it will be when you have a nine-person board making a decision on what projects get done.

1322
01:46:51,848 --> 01:47:05,578
[SPEAKER_15]: And as the Rappaport's saying, 70% of those projects are usually more heavily weighted towards open space, of which Medford is one of the more fortunate communities to have about 28% open space already.

1323
01:47:06,559 --> 01:47:14,564
[SPEAKER_15]: And when we talk about historical preservation, do you wanna surcharge on your tax to pay for the Brooks Estate after the discussion we had earlier tonight?

1324
01:47:18,067 --> 01:47:19,388
[SPEAKER_15]: So as a housing advocate,

1325
01:47:20,594 --> 01:47:26,278
[SPEAKER_15]: who deals with at-risk populations daily, I'm not too sold on the Community Preservation Act.

1326
01:47:26,938 --> 01:47:40,466
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing Rappaport found out is most of the projects that are done under the Community Preservation Act actually end up costing more than if it had gone through a regular budget process at the city level.

1327
01:47:41,247 --> 01:47:45,590
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing you don't know when you read the law is that

1328
01:47:46,706 --> 01:47:56,433
[SPEAKER_15]: The city in that ordinance can also decide that 2% of your property tax, not the surcharge, but your property tax can go to matching.

1329
01:47:56,894 --> 01:48:10,084
[SPEAKER_15]: So not only will you might get money from the state, because that money's been diminishing, to match what you pay on a surcharge, but the ordinance could also require that 2% of your property tax

1330
01:48:13,348 --> 01:48:25,679
[SPEAKER_15]: would go towards these projects in the form of a match, which means that, let's say the city has a million dollars in property tax, 200,000, city could come up with matching funds up to 200,000.

1331
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:37,851
[SPEAKER_15]: And those matching funds have to be private funds, so the law highlights that you could use parking fees, you could use hotel excise taxes,

1332
01:48:39,626 --> 01:48:45,975
[SPEAKER_15]: other private funding that the city raises out of state and federal funds to put towards the project that this group decides.

1333
01:48:48,539 --> 01:48:55,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I don't think parking fees and linkage fees and hotel access taxes

1334
01:48:55,853 --> 01:48:57,733
[SPEAKER_15]: were to be used towards these projects.

1335
01:48:57,833 --> 01:49:06,655
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we were trying to use them to cover gaps in our budget around police staffing and fire staffing and filling potholes and so forth.

1336
01:49:07,915 --> 01:49:13,496
[SPEAKER_15]: So the issue is it becomes less of a democratic process and more of a controlling process of a commission.

1337
01:49:13,897 --> 01:49:20,978
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the transparency level, as much as we say we're gonna have public participation, doesn't always happen in this city.

1338
01:49:22,802 --> 01:49:30,585
[SPEAKER_15]: So as a public, you open yourself up to voting for something that you really don't know what it's going to take a form at.

1339
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:46,290
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's been cities like Newton where there's been issues where there's been fight between open space groups and historical preservations groups fighting over the dollars and finding that the roads don't get fixed and other infrastructure problems really don't get fixed.

1340
01:49:46,310 --> 01:49:52,352
[SPEAKER_15]: So even though we sell that it might help get a fire station or a police station, that doesn't always happen.

1341
01:49:53,316 --> 01:50:02,078
[SPEAKER_15]: becomes more of a political process, again, because you've isolated it down to an appointed commission with maybe some elected members.

1342
01:50:02,519 --> 01:50:03,799
[SPEAKER_15]: And who's going to be elected?

1343
01:50:03,939 --> 01:50:17,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Not the ordinary person that's over in East Medford, or the low-income person who may want to see something else done, or may want to see more vouchers for their affordable housing.

1344
01:50:17,923 --> 01:50:20,063
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's not much transparency on it.

1345
01:50:22,688 --> 01:50:31,793
[SPEAKER_15]: it becomes less of what I call a democratic process of where the whole community really is focused on what really needs to get done in this city.

1346
01:50:32,933 --> 01:50:49,502
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would caution the public that you need to be aware of the details, the devil's in the details around what that ordinance will be and the political process and the political pressure that will be put on this city council, whoever they may be in the future,

1347
01:50:50,505 --> 01:51:06,917
[SPEAKER_15]: to determine what those projects will be as opposed to Joe Schmoe or Jane Schmoe coming up and talking about the police department and what they'd like to see as a priorities and maybe their pothole fills and maybe their water pipes changed and so forth for the pressure.

1348
01:51:08,218 --> 01:51:18,525
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'd hate to vote for the CPA and find out that 70% of the surcharge money that gets collected gets put to a Brooks estate where we're sitting here

1349
01:51:19,395 --> 01:51:23,618
[SPEAKER_15]: trying to figure out how we pay $24,000 for mismanagement.

1350
01:51:24,299 --> 01:51:24,699
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1351
01:51:29,583 --> 01:51:30,023
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

1352
01:51:30,083 --> 01:51:31,965
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record, sir.

1353
01:51:32,385 --> 01:51:33,486
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1354
01:51:33,586 --> 01:51:36,008
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm Robert Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

1355
01:51:36,828 --> 01:51:37,549
[SPEAKER_21]: Through the chair,

1356
01:51:38,305 --> 01:51:46,549
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to thank from the bottom of my heart the last speaker who spoke so eloquently, spot on, and precise.

1357
01:51:46,989 --> 01:51:48,870
[SPEAKER_21]: Her information is invaluable.

1358
01:51:49,391 --> 01:52:01,557
[SPEAKER_21]: I would just like to remind this body of a presentation I gave you back in November of 2011 on the International Council for Local Environmental Issues.

1359
01:52:02,137 --> 01:52:03,358
[SPEAKER_21]: Please check your

1360
01:52:04,271 --> 01:52:06,515
[SPEAKER_21]: research avenues.

1361
01:52:07,016 --> 01:52:07,797
[SPEAKER_21]: I just looked it up.

1362
01:52:07,917 --> 01:52:09,420
[SPEAKER_21]: It's still on the MedFed patch.

1363
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:11,543
[SPEAKER_21]: I passed out a pamphlet

1364
01:52:12,183 --> 01:52:14,764
[SPEAKER_21]: To each and every one of you, I hope you've retained them.

1365
01:52:14,864 --> 01:52:16,464
[SPEAKER_21]: If not, I have copies at home.

1366
01:52:16,964 --> 01:52:17,844
[SPEAKER_21]: Please look that up.

1367
01:52:19,324 --> 01:52:25,686
[SPEAKER_21]: I cannot elaborate more on what Carolyn just said here, because it was excellent and spot on.

1368
01:52:26,166 --> 01:52:39,329
[SPEAKER_21]: But there are other ways of bringing affordable housing to the residents of Medford and the state, which is through tax incentive.

1369
01:52:39,849 --> 01:52:40,669
[SPEAKER_21]: If we bring in

1370
01:52:41,515 --> 01:52:57,727
[SPEAKER_21]: more businesses through tax incentive, and we get some of these more than 20 vacant storefronts filled with thriving businesses, and we get people gainfully employed, then they'll be able to afford their own housing.

1371
01:52:59,008 --> 01:53:05,012
[SPEAKER_21]: Putting taxes on top of taxes to hope that these monies are used.

1372
01:53:05,373 --> 01:53:11,157
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I'm reminded of Ronald Reagan's scariest nine words, I'm from the government and I'm here to help.

1373
01:53:12,430 --> 01:53:18,272
[SPEAKER_21]: We have been paying taxes in this city, in this state, and in this nation through the nose.

1374
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:21,053
[SPEAKER_21]: And quite frankly, what have we got for it?

1375
01:53:21,693 --> 01:53:25,314
[SPEAKER_21]: A police department that's understaffed, a police station that's falling apart.

1376
01:53:26,915 --> 01:53:30,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Another guy's going to come up and speak on a house on my street, Evans Street.

1377
01:53:30,836 --> 01:53:32,517
[SPEAKER_21]: I welcome you all to drive down

1378
01:53:33,072 --> 01:53:37,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Evans Street, right now after this meeting, tomorrow in the daylight.

1379
01:53:37,416 --> 01:53:38,376
[SPEAKER_21]: It is a war zone.

1380
01:53:38,657 --> 01:53:40,478
[SPEAKER_21]: The street is falling apart.

1381
01:53:40,858 --> 01:53:44,321
[SPEAKER_21]: Huge boulders coming up from the gravel and the sediment.

1382
01:53:44,661 --> 01:53:47,864
[SPEAKER_21]: That's one street of many streets in this community.

1383
01:53:48,244 --> 01:54:00,034
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're supposed to expect now, through this Community Preservation Act, that paying more taxes, throwing more money at the problem is going to somehow be a solution?

1384
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:05,412
[SPEAKER_21]: I urge you, please look up that presentation I gave.

1385
01:54:06,133 --> 01:54:08,355
[SPEAKER_21]: Open spaces sounds wonderful.

1386
01:54:08,695 --> 01:54:17,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Until you find out that you're restricted to go on there, a citizen who's paying taxes in this community should be able to go on any open space.

1387
01:54:18,222 --> 01:54:28,950
[SPEAKER_21]: Please, I urge you, look up that presentation I gave you, and I'm gonna write a nice letter to the editor urging the citizens of Medford to vote this matter down.

1388
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:29,551
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1389
01:54:38,505 --> 01:54:41,728
[SPEAKER_22]: uh, John's Toronto 20 Metcalfe Street, Medford messages.

1390
01:54:41,748 --> 01:54:52,296
[SPEAKER_22]: So I understand, Mr. President, uh, this is merely an informational, uh, uh, discussion, uh, concerning this, uh, community preservation act.

1391
01:54:53,336 --> 01:54:55,178
[SPEAKER_22]: So I want to proceed on that basis.

1392
01:54:56,198 --> 01:55:01,362
[SPEAKER_22]: And I understand that this, uh, act was passed in the year of 2000 and that was 15 years ago.

1393
01:55:01,422 --> 01:55:01,883
[SPEAKER_22]: And those 15 years,

1394
01:55:06,579 --> 01:55:12,324
[SPEAKER_22]: Not even half of the 351 communities in Massachusetts have adopted it.

1395
01:55:12,404 --> 01:55:13,665
[SPEAKER_22]: So that tells you something.

1396
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:25,076
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, it's my understanding that once we adopt it, if we do, it cannot be changed for five years or canceled out.

1397
01:55:26,937 --> 01:55:30,440
[SPEAKER_22]: But during that time, actually, it will be

1398
01:55:31,591 --> 01:55:35,672
[SPEAKER_22]: increased each year because it's based on a 1.5% surcharge.

1399
01:55:35,692 --> 01:55:42,994
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, this is, as people here have noted repeatedly, this is a new tax.

1400
01:55:46,014 --> 01:55:47,334
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't deceive yourself on that.

1401
01:55:48,535 --> 01:55:50,055
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a new tax completely.

1402
01:55:50,835 --> 01:55:54,916
[SPEAKER_22]: And as a matter of fact, it bypasses Proposition 2.5.

1403
01:55:56,056 --> 01:55:57,997
[SPEAKER_22]: We have Proposition 2.5, which says that

1404
01:55:59,810 --> 01:56:06,432
[SPEAKER_22]: the tax levy cannot be increased except by an override.

1405
01:56:07,513 --> 01:56:12,154
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is not an override, and yet the tax does increase.

1406
01:56:12,975 --> 01:56:25,599
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, the 1.5% does not seem like much, but it will be also placed on senior citizens who are living on a fixed income and

1407
01:56:26,030 --> 01:56:30,733
[SPEAKER_22]: In many of these cases, these people have only one asset, their houses.

1408
01:56:31,593 --> 01:56:40,618
[SPEAKER_22]: So what happens in this case is that they are compelled to pay a higher tax and just don't have the wherewithal.

1409
01:56:42,339 --> 01:56:48,142
[SPEAKER_22]: So insofar as the matching funds are concerned, they're not being matched.

1410
01:56:49,283 --> 01:56:50,663
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand that in year 2011,

1411
01:56:54,521 --> 01:56:55,681
[SPEAKER_22]: The state had paid only 27%.

1412
01:56:55,721 --> 01:56:56,062
[SPEAKER_22]: That's not 100%.

1413
01:56:56,122 --> 01:56:56,842
[SPEAKER_22]: And in 2014, they paid 31%.

1414
01:56:57,282 --> 01:56:58,562
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's my point.

1415
01:56:58,582 --> 01:57:01,223
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a tax, and it is a very expensive tax.

1416
01:57:17,009 --> 01:57:18,830
[SPEAKER_22]: It somehow bypasses Prop 2.5.

1417
01:57:19,331 --> 01:57:20,992
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know how that was accomplished.

1418
01:57:21,713 --> 01:57:24,335
[SPEAKER_22]: Because here you are having a tax on a tax.

1419
01:57:25,936 --> 01:57:26,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1420
01:57:26,856 --> 01:57:27,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1421
01:57:34,042 --> 01:57:38,065
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm taking my hat off, Freddie, in honor of you.

1422
01:57:43,489 --> 01:57:44,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an awful interesting.

1423
01:57:46,361 --> 01:57:51,204
[SPEAKER_03]: awful interesting, the people I see out here who are with this.

1424
01:57:51,444 --> 01:57:53,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, how are you doing?

1425
01:57:53,765 --> 01:57:54,626
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen you for ages.

1426
01:57:54,646 --> 01:57:59,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen him for ages, working on this issue.

1427
01:58:00,689 --> 01:58:07,393
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting because I don't see anyone I know from the disability community.

1428
01:58:09,150 --> 01:58:22,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting because I don't see anybody as a doctor who's worked with over a thousand different people, sometimes count their whole family.

1429
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:24,641
[SPEAKER_03]: in this area.

1430
01:58:25,201 --> 01:58:33,406
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting that they didn't bring up any people of disabilities who will be on this board.

1431
01:58:34,066 --> 01:58:45,753
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting that we talked a little bit earlier about the idea of skepticism and what that represents.

1432
01:58:46,845 --> 01:58:56,310
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been very interesting had they gone out and gone differently about approaching this issue.

1433
01:58:56,911 --> 01:59:12,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And the approach on a more democratic fashion would have been to allow the people who disagree with it to stand next to them and tell the people who were signing it why they disagreed with it.

1434
01:59:15,854 --> 01:59:17,095
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you call a debate.

1435
01:59:18,636 --> 01:59:19,656
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no debate.

1436
01:59:20,376 --> 01:59:22,457
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no talk.

1437
01:59:23,458 --> 01:59:42,886
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is, under their own plan, $1 million that they're going to hone in on and be able to tell people, nine people, you're only seven, nine people are going to tell the city,

1438
01:59:43,958 --> 01:59:45,819
[SPEAKER_03]: who, what, where, and when.

1439
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:52,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, there are 25% of the city that's disabled.

1440
01:59:54,926 --> 01:59:58,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I get tired of coming up here and reminding people.

1441
01:59:59,610 --> 02:00:00,731
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't get hired.

1442
02:00:02,512 --> 02:00:03,973
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of us are low income.

1443
02:00:05,154 --> 02:00:09,317
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of us probably don't want you to know we want hardships.

1444
02:00:10,959 --> 02:00:12,560
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of us are different.

1445
02:00:13,992 --> 02:00:15,233
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're here.

1446
02:00:17,835 --> 02:00:29,503
[SPEAKER_03]: The body of politics is supposed to represent the most under-representative groups of people in the country.

1447
02:00:31,064 --> 02:00:42,513
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea of both philosophy of religion and philosophy of philosophy is to represent the most

1448
02:00:43,981 --> 02:00:48,144
[SPEAKER_03]: indigent, and helpless people to make them equal.

1449
02:00:48,904 --> 02:01:02,433
[SPEAKER_03]: The Democratic Party is, though some of you are Republicans, I know, but most of the people behind me, I also work for Birmingham, if you remember correctly.

1450
02:01:03,894 --> 02:01:08,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I also talk to people for Mr. Birmingham.

1451
02:01:12,379 --> 02:01:13,000
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a shame.

1452
02:01:14,563 --> 02:01:24,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of these projects that I've read about are boards of people who are developers' dreams.

1453
02:01:26,106 --> 02:01:37,088
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes along with new starts, developing beyond what actually needs to be developed and won't let it to be done naturally.

1454
02:01:38,245 --> 02:01:52,468
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes beyond all the things that anybody with a reasonable thought, except for the nine or 10 people who may be qualified to be on that board.

1455
02:01:54,569 --> 02:02:01,350
[SPEAKER_03]: Already, they never asked me to come to their meetings to talk about it, against it, or for it.

1456
02:02:02,670 --> 02:02:06,672
[SPEAKER_03]: The word community, sorry, I'm not part of the community.

1457
02:02:06,992 --> 02:02:08,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't part of the community.

1458
02:02:09,554 --> 02:02:10,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard that many times.

1459
02:02:11,755 --> 02:02:18,718
[SPEAKER_03]: The bicycle commission, when I applied to do tricycles, same type of people, same people.

1460
02:02:20,599 --> 02:02:21,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't want me on it.

1461
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:26,102
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael McGlynn didn't want me on the Disability Commission.

1462
02:02:26,383 --> 02:02:33,868
[SPEAKER_03]: When they told you nobody was asking to be on, that man right there asked to be on certain commissions.

1463
02:02:34,349 --> 02:02:36,410
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been asked to be on certain commissions.

1464
02:02:36,430 --> 02:02:37,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we stay on topic?

1465
02:02:38,132 --> 02:02:38,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon me?

1466
02:02:38,592 --> 02:02:39,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we stay on topic?

1467
02:02:40,153 --> 02:02:42,115
[SPEAKER_03]: If you listen, you'll understand the topic.

1468
02:02:42,575 --> 02:02:46,298
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a well-educated man, and you know I'm on topic.

1469
02:02:46,538 --> 02:02:50,642
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about the nine people being on that.

1470
02:02:50,982 --> 02:02:52,143
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the topic.

1471
02:02:52,864 --> 02:03:00,150
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the commission itself or the presence of the people who will elect or not elect it.

1472
02:03:00,530 --> 02:03:09,038
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the position of Brooks' estate type people who failed at everything and are going to use it for political gains.

1473
02:03:09,558 --> 02:03:12,800
[SPEAKER_03]: and not for the best interest of the public in this city.

1474
02:03:13,341 --> 02:03:14,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish they would.

1475
02:03:15,062 --> 02:03:17,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be all for them if they would.

1476
02:03:18,044 --> 02:03:26,930
[SPEAKER_03]: But by not inviting people to their meetings, by not inviting skeptics or critics to their meetings, they're only giving you one version.

1477
02:03:28,371 --> 02:03:29,132
[SPEAKER_03]: One version.

1478
02:03:29,872 --> 02:03:32,974
[SPEAKER_03]: This state has to stop doing that.

1479
02:03:33,555 --> 02:03:35,276
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't Dr. Wood saying that.

1480
02:03:35,516 --> 02:03:36,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Robert Reich says that.

1481
02:03:37,888 --> 02:03:41,310
[SPEAKER_03]: He says it under the concept of what politics is about.

1482
02:03:41,851 --> 02:03:47,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anybody bothered to read the Boston Globe lately and see what he wrote a couple weeks ago?

1483
02:03:47,755 --> 02:03:49,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what's happening here.

1484
02:03:49,416 --> 02:03:52,618
[SPEAKER_03]: People are getting shut off by politics.

1485
02:03:53,539 --> 02:03:54,940
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting tired of it.

1486
02:03:55,560 --> 02:04:01,104
[SPEAKER_03]: And my wife presented, does the grassroots going to get anybody on the board there?

1487
02:04:01,884 --> 02:04:03,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even asking for the grassroots.

1488
02:04:04,146 --> 02:04:06,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking for lower than the grassroots.

1489
02:04:07,633 --> 02:04:20,505
[SPEAKER_03]: But I am asking you as a body, and you the public, to think about, do you want your daughter, your son to be in when you get a chance to buy housing?

1490
02:04:21,026 --> 02:04:23,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you want it to change the city?

1491
02:04:23,788 --> 02:04:25,310
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be changed naturally.

1492
02:04:25,650 --> 02:04:26,871
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I see you stood up.

1493
02:04:27,412 --> 02:04:30,555
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously, you've given up me the boot.

1494
02:04:31,160 --> 02:04:31,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1495
02:04:31,600 --> 02:04:33,942
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to say, I don't appreciate it.

1496
02:04:34,482 --> 02:04:37,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard people, I sat and timed people out here, son.

1497
02:04:39,005 --> 02:04:42,807
[SPEAKER_03]: And your father would be very, very proud.

1498
02:04:53,633 --> 02:04:53,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes?

1499
02:05:04,611 --> 02:05:16,258
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go back to the regular order of business we have Good evening

1500
02:05:29,727 --> 02:05:30,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

1501
02:05:30,527 --> 02:05:32,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

1502
02:05:32,408 --> 02:05:34,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Paone, Winthrop Street, Medford.

1503
02:05:35,429 --> 02:05:36,830
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not going to be a two-minute thing.

1504
02:05:38,030 --> 02:05:40,771
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two topics I'd like to discuss.

1505
02:05:40,951 --> 02:05:49,194
[SPEAKER_02]: One, first of all, I'm very grateful for the city of Medford for two years ago when you guys asked the mayor to extend the leaf pickup.

1506
02:05:49,994 --> 02:05:52,915
[SPEAKER_02]: We lost a month, but we picked up an extra week in December.

1507
02:05:53,496 --> 02:05:56,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, obviously, as you all know, the foliage has not fallen off the trees.

1508
02:05:57,610 --> 02:05:58,771
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna have an issue this year.

1509
02:05:59,552 --> 02:06:05,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about anybody else in the city, but I don't have enough room on my property to store leaves through the wintertime.

1510
02:06:06,177 --> 02:06:11,761
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to ask for another extension, maybe a couple more weeks in December, maybe into January.

1511
02:06:11,902 --> 02:06:13,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know when the leaves are gonna fall, right?

1512
02:06:13,943 --> 02:06:23,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, if that's not an issue, or if that's not a solution, could we try maybe the city yard to store our leaves once they fall?

1513
02:06:23,971 --> 02:06:26,053
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just a topic just to ask.

1514
02:06:26,545 --> 02:06:28,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just, I was having trouble hearing you.

1515
02:06:28,226 --> 02:06:29,367
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'd like an extension.

1516
02:06:29,767 --> 02:06:31,888
[SPEAKER_07]: No, sometimes cause the mic doesn't point back here.

1517
02:06:31,948 --> 02:06:32,809
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can always hear.

1518
02:06:32,829 --> 02:06:33,529
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1519
02:06:33,589 --> 02:06:46,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little extension on the leaf pickup, Mr. Clark, if it's possible, if it's possible, because obviously the foliage hasn't fallen off the trees and we're still going to be, we'll only have three more pickups after this week.

1520
02:06:48,536 --> 02:07:02,019
[SPEAKER_02]: My second topic I'd like to discuss, and I was observing and listening to all the great conversations about a lot of the money that is being allocated to these certain charitable organizations and stuff like that.

1521
02:07:02,579 --> 02:07:09,521
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got to ask this profound question, and sometimes I need to just live by three things.

1522
02:07:10,561 --> 02:07:11,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it need to be said?

1523
02:07:11,381 --> 02:07:12,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it need to be said now?

1524
02:07:12,501 --> 02:07:13,341
[SPEAKER_02]: And do I need to say it?

1525
02:07:13,361 --> 02:07:15,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's about time the city

1526
02:07:16,548 --> 02:07:19,190
[SPEAKER_02]: acknowledges the major, major problem.

1527
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:37,683
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a life-threatening problem in this city, and it's drugs and alcohol, and it starts with the fact that we have an unmanned, low police department, not a lot of policemen, and the response time to emergency situations is really bad.

1528
02:07:39,965 --> 02:07:42,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly believe that the future of Medford is

1529
02:07:44,115 --> 02:07:45,255
[SPEAKER_02]: There might not be a city.

1530
02:07:45,295 --> 02:07:46,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been here five and a half decades.

1531
02:07:47,116 --> 02:07:52,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lived here four decades, and I've watched how it's gotten worse.

1532
02:07:53,198 --> 02:08:09,164
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, and it's just so obvious, and I see it all the time, we have drug dealers, we have all kinds of people that are doing unspeakable things in this city, and I observe it every day.

1533
02:08:09,946 --> 02:08:17,432
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we don't have the manpower and the police force to handle the capacity of all the little underlining causes.

1534
02:08:17,472 --> 02:08:18,513
[SPEAKER_02]: And the future is the kids.

1535
02:08:19,253 --> 02:08:20,114
[SPEAKER_02]: And I truly believe that.

1536
02:08:20,154 --> 02:08:21,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two adult children.

1537
02:08:21,996 --> 02:08:23,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of them are successful.

1538
02:08:23,597 --> 02:08:24,478
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me tell you something.

1539
02:08:24,778 --> 02:08:30,743
[SPEAKER_02]: When I see how bad the drug and alcohol problem in the city is, it's out of control.

1540
02:08:31,503 --> 02:08:37,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And I recently had a situation where I had to call the police department to respond to an incident.

1541
02:08:38,727 --> 02:08:40,128
[SPEAKER_02]: pertaining to this situation.

1542
02:08:41,388 --> 02:08:51,193
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time they arrived, the people who were causing the situation, the drug dealing, the drug participation, they had already gone.

1543
02:08:51,693 --> 02:08:53,054
[SPEAKER_02]: So there wasn't a good response time.

1544
02:08:53,614 --> 02:08:54,955
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that they're on demand.

1545
02:08:55,976 --> 02:08:57,296
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't have a lot of performance.

1546
02:08:57,336 --> 02:09:02,799
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the priority should be for our kids to have a future here.

1547
02:09:03,755 --> 02:09:06,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to start focusing on the underlying causes.

1548
02:09:06,756 --> 02:09:07,876
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all a trickle effect.

1549
02:09:07,936 --> 02:09:14,878
[SPEAKER_02]: All this great passages of the environment, and let's clean up the Brooks Estates, and all that stuff.

1550
02:09:15,878 --> 02:09:26,261
[SPEAKER_02]: There won't be that if we keep allowing the criminal element, I'm going to put it in that category, to enter our city and be allowed to do things.

1551
02:09:27,901 --> 02:09:33,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Real brief, I took a license plate off a drug dealer, took his picture,

1552
02:09:38,157 --> 02:09:43,202
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Mr. Wood.

1553
02:09:43,402 --> 02:09:44,683
[SPEAKER_07]: And here we go.

1554
02:09:45,103 --> 02:09:46,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Messenger's gone out there to examine it.

1555
02:09:46,865 --> 02:09:50,749
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I'm going to wrap this up real quick, OK?

1556
02:09:51,229 --> 02:09:55,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I did this, the plate was stolen on the car.

1557
02:09:55,813 --> 02:10:00,398
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a $40,000, $50,000 BMW that this drug dealer was driving.

1558
02:10:01,278 --> 02:10:02,800
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bottom line is that, like,

1559
02:10:04,873 --> 02:10:07,254
No, I do not and again

1560
02:10:23,277 --> 02:10:27,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize for this topic of conversation, but I feel it's important.

1561
02:10:27,338 --> 02:10:27,518
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.

1562
02:10:27,538 --> 02:10:29,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm viewing this and I'm seeing this.

1563
02:10:29,598 --> 02:10:30,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Very important.

1564
02:10:30,238 --> 02:10:31,399
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm real adamant about it.

1565
02:10:31,959 --> 02:10:37,160
[SPEAKER_02]: And like 27 and a half years ago, I was part of the problem of the city.

1566
02:10:37,180 --> 02:10:41,441
[SPEAKER_02]: 27 and a half years ago, I stopped becoming the problem of the city and I started becoming the solution.

1567
02:10:43,261 --> 02:10:44,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just me personally.

1568
02:10:44,741 --> 02:10:52,003
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I see the rampant drug problem, drug trafficking going through the city,

1569
02:10:53,139 --> 02:10:54,620
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets me a little upset.

1570
02:10:55,320 --> 02:11:02,902
[SPEAKER_02]: And I explain this to the police department many times, and I understand they're on demand, and I have to take that into consideration.

1571
02:11:03,542 --> 02:11:08,563
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like it's getting to the point where it's really getting overwhelming.

1572
02:11:09,324 --> 02:11:21,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I take license plate numbers down, and I take pictures of the drug dealers who are coming into this city from other cities to deal drugs to some people, and I'm not mentioning any names,

1573
02:11:22,962 --> 02:11:30,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't get resolved, because either the plates are stolen off of somebody else's car, and they're driving in $40,000 BMW cars.

1574
02:11:30,727 --> 02:11:32,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm laughing at myself here.

1575
02:11:32,948 --> 02:11:35,470
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know who else to turn to.

1576
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:42,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So I come in front of the city council to say, like, maybe, just maybe, maybe somebody can put a message out there.

1577
02:11:42,934 --> 02:11:44,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we need more police.

1578
02:11:45,067 --> 02:11:49,129
[SPEAKER_02]: and our department to enforce these issues because this is all the underlying causes.

1579
02:11:49,189 --> 02:11:55,131
[SPEAKER_02]: The futuristic kids in this city, as far as I'm concerned, they're going to be subject to all this pressure.

1580
02:11:55,832 --> 02:12:00,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my personal history, I was subject to that pressure when I went in the wrong direction.

1581
02:12:01,174 --> 02:12:03,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I'm in a different direction.

1582
02:12:03,735 --> 02:12:07,857
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a long time to get here, but I'm real adamant about this.

1583
02:12:07,937 --> 02:12:09,838
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I'm watching kids die.

1584
02:12:10,348 --> 02:12:13,910
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm seeing them all around, not just Medford, just everywhere.

1585
02:12:14,390 --> 02:12:21,895
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an epidemic that I think is more important than let's not talk about the conservation and all this stuff.

1586
02:12:22,275 --> 02:12:22,735
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

1587
02:12:23,175 --> 02:12:25,117
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to make improvements to the city.

1588
02:12:25,157 --> 02:12:25,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

1589
02:12:25,697 --> 02:12:34,862
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there's no future, with the people coming behind me, like the kids, I don't see how this city is going to expand and get better or whatever.

1590
02:12:35,703 --> 02:12:38,044
[SPEAKER_02]: People can't even afford to buy houses in this city.

1591
02:12:38,764 --> 02:12:39,545
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how bad it is.

1592
02:12:40,093 --> 02:12:43,476
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got to the point, I'm just a regular normal blue collar worker.

1593
02:12:43,516 --> 02:12:45,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not educated, none of that stuff.

1594
02:12:45,077 --> 02:12:48,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a GED from a place, OK?

1595
02:12:48,700 --> 02:12:53,163
[SPEAKER_02]: And all I got to tell you is that this is starting to get overwhelming.

1596
02:12:53,443 --> 02:12:53,964
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

1597
02:12:54,084 --> 02:13:05,953
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I see it blankedly on main streets, and I'm talking about the street I live on, and I see cars parked everywhere, and they're just doing transactions out in the open like it's regular business, you know what I'm saying?

1598
02:13:06,013 --> 02:13:07,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really starts to take its toll on me.

1599
02:13:08,535 --> 02:13:13,599
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the only thing I wanted to say, and again, thank you, President De La Buceau and the City Council.

1600
02:13:13,919 --> 02:13:14,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1601
02:13:14,219 --> 02:13:26,507
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Lungo-Koehn, that we request that an extension be given on the leaf retrieval and that a more suitable solution be found as far as the disposal.

1602
02:13:27,948 --> 02:13:32,491
[SPEAKER_07]: And furthermore, did you want to put into your own words the request regarding substance use?

1603
02:13:33,292 --> 02:13:33,772
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I agree.

1604
02:13:33,872 --> 02:13:35,013
[SPEAKER_18]: If we could extend the leaf

1605
02:13:35,763 --> 02:14:03,814
[SPEAKER_18]: pick up we do remember we requested that last time and he may you know the gentleman makes a good point if the leaves don't fall in time and we have no more leaf pickups it's gonna be a mess of a winter so if we could either maybe extend one or two of those dates that would be helpful and the second point is we we did discuss the crime in the Salem Street area last week and we moved that we have a subcommittee meeting with the chief of police to discuss that so maybe we should add

1606
02:14:05,534 --> 02:14:16,558
[SPEAKER_18]: have been bringing on maybe a detective or two to meet with us at that subcommittee of the whole and discuss these other issues that, you know, need to be discussed within that meeting.

1607
02:14:16,698 --> 02:14:17,778
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that would be helpful.

1608
02:14:17,798 --> 02:14:24,981
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn, all those in favor?

1609
02:14:25,001 --> 02:14:25,401

02:15:03,223 --> 02:15:32,863

1624
02:16:05,267 --> 02:16:10,330

[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

1633
02:16:23,378 --> 02:16:24,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry for the wait.

1634
02:16:24,398 --> 02:16:24,838
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

1635
02:16:25,039 --> 02:16:25,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1636
02:16:29,295 --> 02:16:43,343
[SPEAKER_07]: 15-689, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the building inspector, solicitor, OCD, and council establish a working group for the purpose of drafting an ordinance and establishing regulations to govern condominium conversions.

1637
02:16:43,423 --> 02:16:44,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1638
02:16:44,964 --> 02:16:46,425
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1639
02:16:46,445 --> 02:16:49,207
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate you entertaining this resolution this evening.

1640
02:16:53,721 --> 02:16:58,403
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't say trend in the city of Medford, where multifamily homes are being converted into condominiums.

1641
02:16:58,664 --> 02:17:02,125
[SPEAKER_10]: And the actual process thereof is very limited.

1642
02:17:02,325 --> 02:17:07,328
[SPEAKER_10]: The homeowner gets some condo docks together, they submit them to City Hall, and then that's pretty much the process.

1643
02:17:07,888 --> 02:17:16,773
[SPEAKER_10]: But what's happening is we're seeing a number of our multifamily homes, Mr. President, be converted into condominiums, and as a result, our rental market

1644
02:17:17,423 --> 02:17:19,164
[SPEAKER_10]: has become much smaller.

1645
02:17:19,704 --> 02:17:23,546
[SPEAKER_10]: So the demand for rental units is sky high.

1646
02:17:24,127 --> 02:17:26,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Therefore, the cost of the rental units is sky high.

1647
02:17:27,088 --> 02:17:29,890
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's in the city's best interest that we take a look at

1648
02:17:31,659 --> 02:17:48,371
[SPEAKER_10]: The way that we're doing business in terms of converting condominiums and the way that we govern that process, to be sure that we keep in mind that there is also a dramatic effect that it has on our access to the number of units that we have in our community that are affordable for moderate income households.

1649
02:17:48,771 --> 02:17:58,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, if we see, you know, every multifamily home on Yale Street get converted into condominiums, then every multifamily home that once had a rental unit in it no longer has a rental unit in there.

1650
02:17:58,877 --> 02:18:09,123
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're seeing our actual stock of affordable rental units coming off the market and being replaced with much more expensive condominiums that people in the low to moderate income range can't afford, Mr. President.

1651
02:18:09,445 --> 02:18:19,296
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that it's in our best interest to take a look at this and to come up with an ordinance or rules and regulations that would best fit what works here in Medford and come up with a nice solution for this problem.

1652
02:18:19,316 --> 02:18:28,587
[SPEAKER_10]: I think one of the other things that I've always said is that affordable housing is going to be a key to revitalizing our squares so that the people that work in our city have the means and opportunity to live in our city.

1653
02:18:28,947 --> 02:18:34,269
[SPEAKER_10]: So they can continue to, you know, contribute their discretionary income into the circular flow of our economy, Mr. President.

1654
02:18:34,289 --> 02:18:39,850
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think affordable housing is something that's going to be a very vital component to revitalizing our squares as well.

1655
02:18:39,890 --> 02:18:41,311
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I bring this resolution forward.

1656
02:18:42,031 --> 02:18:42,531
[SPEAKER_19]: Precisely.

1657
02:18:42,611 --> 02:18:44,352
[SPEAKER_19]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

1658
02:18:44,532 --> 02:18:45,232
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1659
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:54,895
[SPEAKER_19]: If the council wouldn't mind, if along with talking with condos, if we could talk about the conversions from twos to threes, threes to fours, and put that in there also.

1660
02:18:55,555 --> 02:18:57,756
[SPEAKER_19]: Because that's just as big as a problem.

1661
02:18:58,505 --> 02:19:00,806
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I certainly wouldn't have a problem looking at that as a B paper.

1662
02:19:00,966 --> 02:19:07,309
[SPEAKER_10]: My concern is that when multi-families are being converted into condominiums, more units are coming off the rental market.

1663
02:19:08,209 --> 02:19:14,071
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that the problem that's caused with the conversion of two families into three families or four families is the inverse.

1664
02:19:14,151 --> 02:19:17,573
[SPEAKER_10]: More units come on the rental market, but they also bring more cars to a neighborhood.

1665
02:19:17,953 --> 02:19:20,314
[SPEAKER_10]: They also bring more problems to a neighborhood, Mr. President.

1666
02:19:20,494 --> 02:19:22,975
[SPEAKER_10]: We had to solve problems, so I have no problem with that.

1667
02:19:23,898 --> 02:19:27,119
[SPEAKER_07]: On that motion, sir, you wish to address us, please state your name and address for the record.

1668
02:19:27,159 --> 02:19:28,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Anthony Antonio, 12 Yale Street.

1669
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:30,721
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate that motion, Councilor Knight.

1670
02:19:31,581 --> 02:19:37,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Would that also include the absentee landlord situation that we're experiencing in Redford right now?

1671
02:19:38,204 --> 02:19:39,284
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned Yale Street.

1672
02:19:39,344 --> 02:19:41,405
[SPEAKER_05]: We have quite a few absentee landlords on there.

1673
02:19:41,425 --> 02:19:44,687
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not condominiumizing the units, but they are

1674
02:19:46,052 --> 02:19:46,973
[SPEAKER_05]: being overcrowded.

1675
02:19:48,374 --> 02:19:53,298
[SPEAKER_05]: I would imagine there are some, I can't see it, I haven't seen it, but I've seen workmen go into places.

1676
02:19:53,578 --> 02:20:00,644
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure there are some situations where we have stalls on the floors where people, six, seven, eight, nine unrelated people are in there.

1677
02:20:01,545 --> 02:20:08,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that our local ordinance would speak to the difference between a lodging house and a rooming house and what's inappropriate.

1678
02:20:10,217 --> 02:20:25,286
[SPEAKER_10]: facility for the rental to individuals that aren't related, and our code enforcement office has been very responsive to the inquiries that I've made, and I'd ask that if you become aware of any of those situations to let me know, and I'll be happy to have him look into it if you've been unsuccessful in that regard.

1679
02:20:25,526 --> 02:20:29,069
[SPEAKER_10]: But the purpose of this resolution doesn't speak to that at all, Mr. D'Antonio.

1680
02:20:29,349 --> 02:20:33,871
[SPEAKER_10]: I mentioned Yale Street just because when I think of South Medford, I think of you when I think of Yale Street.

1681
02:20:33,931 --> 02:20:36,373
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what made me think of it.

1682
02:20:36,393 --> 02:20:37,734
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you very much.

1683
02:20:39,957 --> 02:20:44,902
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of council on night for approval, if you wish to speak on this matter, hi, please state your name and address for the record.

1684
02:20:45,062 --> 02:20:46,243
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

1685
02:20:46,443 --> 02:20:48,105
[SPEAKER_00]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

1686
02:20:48,566 --> 02:20:52,830
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're bringing up the issue of building inspectors, I want to bring up an issue that came to my attention today.

1687
02:20:54,031 --> 02:20:57,915
[SPEAKER_00]: While walking on Evans Street, there's a unit now.

1688
02:20:58,635 --> 02:21:00,938
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 3638 Evans Street.

1689
02:21:01,478 --> 02:21:02,659
[SPEAKER_00]: It is being rehabilitated.

1690
02:21:02,719 --> 02:21:03,821
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there was a fire there.

1691
02:21:04,441 --> 02:21:07,763
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are no markings for permits on the space.

1692
02:21:08,003 --> 02:21:19,971
[SPEAKER_00]: And a number of neighbors are worried about whether the space is being illegally rehabilitated, or it's not being brought up to code properly, or if just trying to understand the status of the space.

1693
02:21:20,831 --> 02:21:24,254
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that could be looked into in addition, I would really appreciate it.

1694
02:21:26,935 --> 02:21:27,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1695
02:21:27,836 --> 02:21:28,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1696
02:21:29,377 --> 02:21:31,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

1697
02:21:31,299 --> 02:21:31,279
3336.

1698
02:21:31,639 --> 02:21:35,322
[SPEAKER_07]: 3638 Evans Street.

1699
02:21:36,864 --> 02:21:39,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please state your name and address for the record.

1700
02:21:39,526 --> 02:21:40,607
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1701
02:21:40,727 --> 02:21:43,289
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm Robert Cappucci of 71 Evans Street.

1702
02:21:44,150 --> 02:21:49,735
[SPEAKER_21]: Back to the Honorable Councilor Knight's topic for the condo.

1703
02:21:49,755 --> 02:21:50,736
[SPEAKER_01]: The topic that we're on.

1704
02:21:50,816 --> 02:21:54,479
[SPEAKER_21]: I would just respectfully request that

1705
02:21:54,906 --> 02:22:15,223
[SPEAKER_21]: that you look into it because, I mean, if people are renting in perpetuity without any hope of ownership, and converting these places into condos makes it more feasible or practical, puts them on a road to ownership, that might actually be a benefit for the city.

1706
02:22:15,323 --> 02:22:19,887
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would just request that you look into it from all matters the pros.

1707
02:22:20,393 --> 02:22:21,374
[SPEAKER_21]: and the cons, thank you.

1708
02:22:21,614 --> 02:22:22,454
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much.

1709
02:22:22,935 --> 02:22:25,516
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the main motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1710
02:22:25,536 --> 02:22:29,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry, Councilor Penta, I apologize.

1711
02:22:29,839 --> 02:22:39,045
[SPEAKER_04]: The question I want to ask Councilor Knight is, are you suggesting by doing this, you might want to retire, future?

1712
02:22:39,898 --> 02:22:41,720
[SPEAKER_04]: condo conversions, to keep them as residentials?

1713
02:22:41,740 --> 02:22:43,601
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that would be the word that I would use.

1714
02:22:44,562 --> 02:22:44,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop.

1715
02:22:45,803 --> 02:22:46,964
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what your card means.

1716
02:22:47,564 --> 02:22:49,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I know it means multiple things, I believe.

1717
02:22:50,306 --> 02:23:02,036
[SPEAKER_10]: But in looking at the resolution in the language that's on the table, what I said was the purpose of crafting an ordinance and establishing regulations to govern condominium conversions, to govern it.

1718
02:23:02,483 --> 02:23:10,032
[SPEAKER_10]: I asked all the stakeholders to be involved, the building inspector, the solicitor, the office of community development, and the council, and there might even be room to bring the housing authority into this.

1719
02:23:10,793 --> 02:23:20,123
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't proclaim to have all the answers, Mr. President, but I think that it's an issue that's there that needs to be addressed, that needs to be looked at, and we need to bring the people that are experts in to actually help us out and navigate the course so that we can craft

1720
02:23:21,024 --> 02:23:22,385
[SPEAKER_10]: A model that works here for us in Medford.

1721
02:23:22,845 --> 02:23:23,725
[SPEAKER_04]: But what is the question?

1722
02:23:23,745 --> 02:23:26,186
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a concern that there are too many conversions taking place?

1723
02:23:26,226 --> 02:23:31,048
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a concern that as more and more conversions take place, the number of rental units are coming off the market.

1724
02:23:31,088 --> 02:23:34,189
[SPEAKER_10]: When there are no rental units in the market, the demand is exceeding the supply.

1725
02:23:34,569 --> 02:23:39,351
[SPEAKER_10]: So the rental market that's out there right now, there's no more $1,500 two-bedroom units.

1726
02:23:39,851 --> 02:23:41,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Now there are $3,000 two-bedroom units.

1727
02:23:42,332 --> 02:23:44,993
[SPEAKER_10]: Or, you know, the poor woman that lived on Tyler Rafferty for 25 years,

1728
02:23:45,573 --> 02:23:53,977
[SPEAKER_10]: whose landlord sold the house to a developer, came and threw her out, now she's living across the street paying double what she was paying for 25 years living on Tyler Road, in Tyler Ave.

1729
02:23:54,057 --> 02:23:55,597
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that's what I'm trying to stem.

1730
02:23:55,617 --> 02:24:05,081
[SPEAKER_10]: There are long-term families, long-term renters in this community that haven't been able to purchase homes, but have really maintained a position here as being a part of our fabric and have really helped make Medford great.

1731
02:24:05,401 --> 02:24:07,882
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that we need to do a better job being sure that they can stay here.

1732
02:24:10,179 --> 02:24:22,264
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear what you're saying as far as that part goes, but I don't read this is what your audience is trying to get to, because I'm getting the opinion here that you'll either want to slow down or stop, and you would be stopping a free enterprise system from doing what it wants.

1733
02:24:22,344 --> 02:24:28,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how can you tell somebody, if you're allowed to have your house converted into condominiums, that you can't?

1734
02:24:28,407 --> 02:24:36,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if this new ordinance comes into place, because quote, unquote, as you say, you're limiting or you're delimiting the amount of available rental space.

1735
02:24:37,753 --> 02:24:43,095
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it needs to be part of the overall affordable housing conversation that we've heard a lot about this evening.

1736
02:24:43,555 --> 02:24:44,775
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's one aspect of it.

1737
02:24:45,275 --> 02:24:55,058
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the rapid conversion of multifamily homes into condominiums with lack of regulation and lack of a governing ordinance is leading us to a position where our rental stock is low.

1738
02:24:55,358 --> 02:25:00,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think the question I like to put an amendment to the paper, Mr. Clark, that the city, Mr. Clark, Mr. Clark.

1739
02:25:05,003 --> 02:25:18,296
[SPEAKER_04]: that the city solicitor report back as to whether the city of Medford can legally, legally enforce, legally enforce reducing the amount of condo conversions.

1740
02:25:19,252 --> 02:25:21,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that that's what this resolution has to do.

1741
02:25:21,154 --> 02:25:23,135
[SPEAKER_04]: You just talked about condominium conversions.

1742
02:25:23,155 --> 02:25:24,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Read the paper that's in front of you, sir.

1743
02:25:24,316 --> 02:25:24,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I am reading it.

1744
02:25:24,717 --> 02:25:30,501
[SPEAKER_10]: Establish a working group for the purpose of crafting an ordinance and establishing regulations to govern condominium conversions.

1745
02:25:30,581 --> 02:25:33,164
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm asking you, you think there are too many conversions taking place?

1746
02:25:33,184 --> 02:25:38,708
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm saying that the rapid expansion of conversions is having a dramatic effect on our affordable housing here in the community.

1747
02:25:38,768 --> 02:25:40,490
[SPEAKER_10]: It's taking rental units off the market.

1748
02:25:40,830 --> 02:25:43,993
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not saying that condo conversions are a bad thing because they help our tax base.

1749
02:25:44,573 --> 02:25:45,873
[SPEAKER_10]: They help our tax base tremendously.

1750
02:25:46,214 --> 02:25:49,174
[SPEAKER_10]: We're having a committee to look at this, and that's all I want to know.

1751
02:25:49,194 --> 02:25:50,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I want a legal question asked in there.

1752
02:25:50,955 --> 02:25:57,117
[SPEAKER_04]: Can the city of Medford enact any kind of an ordinance that limits condo conversions?

1753
02:25:58,057 --> 02:25:59,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's part of the regulations.

1754
02:25:59,518 --> 02:26:00,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you limit them or not?

1755
02:26:00,518 --> 02:26:01,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes or no?

1756
02:26:02,198 --> 02:26:03,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we want to limit them?

1757
02:26:03,779 --> 02:26:06,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'm getting the opinion that that's what you want to do.

1758
02:26:08,412 --> 02:26:09,773
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I guess that's another question.

1759
02:26:09,833 --> 02:26:11,694
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of work to ask.

1760
02:26:11,754 --> 02:26:13,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of a city solicitor's request.

1761
02:26:14,115 --> 02:26:14,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

1762
02:26:14,615 --> 02:26:15,075
[SPEAKER_07]: As amended.

1763
02:26:15,636 --> 02:26:16,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else?

1764
02:26:17,277 --> 02:26:18,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

1765
02:26:18,857 --> 02:26:22,339
[SPEAKER_07]: The Chair recognizes the Vice President, Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

1766
02:26:22,819 --> 02:26:24,220
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1767
02:26:24,440 --> 02:26:26,721
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I hear what both Councilors are saying.

1768
02:26:26,761 --> 02:26:33,125
[SPEAKER_18]: I see Councilor Knight's concern, but I also feel like we'd be sending the question to the

1769
02:26:34,558 --> 02:26:38,801
[SPEAKER_18]: this working group without actually saying what we wanted them to look into.

1770
02:26:39,601 --> 02:26:40,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it to regulate them?

1771
02:26:40,762 --> 02:26:41,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it to limit them?

1772
02:26:41,743 --> 02:26:42,363
[SPEAKER_18]: Or is it not?

1773
02:26:42,443 --> 02:26:55,032
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe the best answer is for us to get together and discuss first what we want this group of people to actually look into and what result we want to come from such a meeting.

1774
02:26:55,052 --> 02:27:00,096
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like we're just kind of leaving this kind of open-ended with regards to what we want them to do.

1775
02:27:00,816 --> 02:27:02,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I see both points.

1776
02:27:04,082 --> 02:27:05,363
[SPEAKER_18]: limit it, can you slow it down?

1777
02:27:05,443 --> 02:27:05,803
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe.

1778
02:27:06,904 --> 02:27:07,805
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you regulate it?

1779
02:27:08,045 --> 02:27:15,331
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't feel like we're giving a good enough or clear enough picture of what we want the building inspector and solicitor and OCD department to do.

1780
02:27:16,211 --> 02:27:18,433
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's just my concern with passing this.

1781
02:27:18,633 --> 02:27:27,720
[SPEAKER_18]: I feel like it would be left kind of up in the air of exactly the problems we want solved and how we want to get to that.

1782
02:27:27,800 --> 02:27:30,563
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we would be the... Right.

1783
02:27:30,603 --> 02:27:33,585
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we need to send it to a subcommittee first and then once we

1784
02:27:33,958 --> 02:27:39,400
[SPEAKER_18]: get guidelines or figure out what the actual problems are, then we can say, what can we do?

1785
02:27:40,178 --> 02:27:40,959
[SPEAKER_10]: solve this problem.

1786
02:27:40,999 --> 02:27:45,241
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think the problem is that the rental units are coming off the market faster than they're being put back in it.

1787
02:27:45,962 --> 02:27:55,528
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we're going to, you know, look at what to do in terms of slowing or speeding up or making it easier or streamlining the permitting process, I mean, there are a number of things that can come up.

1788
02:27:55,588 --> 02:27:58,851
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the question is this, what problems do they see in the building inspector's office?

1789
02:27:58,911 --> 02:28:00,552
[SPEAKER_10]: What problems do they see in the solicitor's office?

1790
02:28:00,592 --> 02:28:01,993
[SPEAKER_10]: What problems do they see in OCD?

1791
02:28:02,433 --> 02:28:04,755
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we need to bring everybody together, put all our heads together.

1792
02:28:04,895 --> 02:28:08,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, I don't have all the answers, Mr. President, but I know there's a problem out there and it's a big problem.

1793
02:28:08,673 --> 02:28:12,694
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know it's a big problem, because I know that the people that I'm friends with can't afford to live in the community anymore.

1794
02:28:12,734 --> 02:28:14,315
[SPEAKER_10]: They can't afford to buy, and they can't afford to rent.

1795
02:28:14,435 --> 02:28:16,616
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're going west, and they're going north, and they're going south.

1796
02:28:16,716 --> 02:28:17,556
[SPEAKER_10]: But they're not staying here.

1797
02:28:17,916 --> 02:28:21,298
[SPEAKER_10]: And the money that's in their pocket isn't getting spent in our convenience stores anymore.

1798
02:28:21,338 --> 02:28:24,399
[SPEAKER_10]: And the money that's in their pocket isn't getting spent at sales and at Jim's Market.

1799
02:28:24,799 --> 02:28:28,700
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not going somewhere else.

1800
02:28:29,260 --> 02:28:29,981
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree with you.

1801
02:28:30,081 --> 02:28:36,283
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe what we need to do is just amend this, take out craft an ordinance, and put in

1802
02:28:37,175 --> 02:28:39,396
[SPEAKER_18]: create a guideline of what problems they're seeing.

1803
02:28:40,117 --> 02:28:42,838
[SPEAKER_18]: So then we can then craft an ordinance with the city solicitor.

1804
02:28:43,138 --> 02:28:48,382
[SPEAKER_18]: We wouldn't want them to craft an ordinance and not really know what the problem, besides these couple that we're mentioning.

1805
02:28:48,402 --> 02:28:52,204
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we need to be a lot more clear.

1806
02:28:52,244 --> 02:28:57,487
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want them to draft an ordinance when I'm really not even sure of exactly what we're asking them to do.

1807
02:28:57,547 --> 02:29:01,789
[SPEAKER_18]: They come back with an ordinance that says we're not going to allow condo conversions for a year.

1808
02:29:01,929 --> 02:29:06,252
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that's going to make some people who want to create condo conversions a little upset.

1809
02:29:06,771 --> 02:29:10,594
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's figure out what the problems are, rather than asking them to actually draft an ordinance.

1810
02:29:10,634 --> 02:29:14,678
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's figure out what we want them to put in the ordinance.

1811
02:29:14,858 --> 02:29:17,741
[SPEAKER_18]: And that, for us, would come from finding out what the problems are.

1812
02:29:17,761 --> 02:29:20,163
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the working group is for.

1813
02:29:20,203 --> 02:29:21,004
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

1814
02:29:29,724 --> 02:29:30,564
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all well and good.

1815
02:29:30,604 --> 02:29:32,685
[SPEAKER_04]: But before you get to that, the question needs to be answered.

1816
02:29:32,705 --> 02:29:36,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Can the city legally regulate multiple family homes to be converted into condos?

1817
02:29:36,787 --> 02:29:41,369
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the, I'd like to have that question asked to the city solicitor, please.

1818
02:29:45,571 --> 02:29:48,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would make sense because if the answer is no,

1819
02:29:50,328 --> 02:29:50,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

1820
02:29:50,789 --> 02:29:53,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if the answer is no, where are you going with this?

1821
02:29:54,052 --> 02:29:54,833
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going nowhere.

1822
02:29:54,873 --> 02:29:59,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if the city cannot regulate this legally, then what discussions are you going to have?

1823
02:29:59,618 --> 02:30:05,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the city always has the opportunity to regulate any type of permitting issuance that goes on in our community.

1824
02:30:06,335 --> 02:30:08,256
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we can streamline the permitting process.

1825
02:30:08,276 --> 02:30:09,557
[SPEAKER_10]: There are other ways we can make it easier.

1826
02:30:09,597 --> 02:30:10,218
[SPEAKER_10]: We can make it harder.

1827
02:30:10,598 --> 02:30:10,998
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?

1828
02:30:11,038 --> 02:30:16,022
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to look at making sure that if, in fact, we're converting condominiums, that we're replacing those rental units with other ones.

1829
02:30:16,082 --> 02:30:19,624
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe he can say yes and let him explain to us yes, or if he says no, no.

1830
02:30:19,724 --> 02:30:26,109
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to me, legally, I would like to know where I'm going with this before I spend a tremendous amount of time having all these people come in.

1831
02:30:26,669 --> 02:30:30,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Or there may be guidelines to say, if you want to limit it, this is the way you can go legally.

1832
02:30:30,612 --> 02:30:32,373
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know, legally, yes or no.

1833
02:30:33,032 --> 02:30:36,354
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can incorporate this as part of this ordinance.

1834
02:30:36,514 --> 02:30:37,715
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what's the problem?

1835
02:30:40,197 --> 02:30:41,878
[SPEAKER_23]: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

1836
02:30:42,538 --> 02:30:43,299
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1837
02:30:44,179 --> 02:30:50,884
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that this is similar to the question that was before this honorable body several years ago, and it was in-law apartments.

1838
02:30:51,706 --> 02:30:58,189
[SPEAKER_23]: And at the time it presented itself, there were residents in the community that wanted to be able to have in-law apartments.

1839
02:30:58,610 --> 02:31:02,131
[SPEAKER_23]: There was a lot of pushback from the building department at the time and different boards.

1840
02:31:04,965 --> 02:31:09,508
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we have to find a direction where the body wants to go before we do anything.

1841
02:31:10,489 --> 02:31:25,800
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would suggest, like Councilor Marks, I think Councilor Knight may have said it, send this to the appropriate subcommittee and hash out, because I'd hate to say any work get done on it if there really isn't some direction as a result of the City Council.

1842
02:31:25,820 --> 02:31:28,222
[SPEAKER_23]: And Councilor Knight is looking to start the conversation.

1843
02:31:28,843 --> 02:31:30,504
[SPEAKER_23]: I think there's merits both to and

1844
02:31:31,618 --> 02:31:34,280
[SPEAKER_23]: for and against on the conversions itself.

1845
02:31:36,002 --> 02:31:38,624
[SPEAKER_23]: Currently, right now, I don't know what the restrictions are.

1846
02:31:38,824 --> 02:31:42,888
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't know if you have to have separate boilers, separate meters, common areas.

1847
02:31:42,928 --> 02:31:43,848
[SPEAKER_23]: These are all good questions.

1848
02:31:44,289 --> 02:31:52,976
[SPEAKER_23]: Quite simply, this could be done just through the zoning, some of the zoning issues, I'm sorry, zoning restrictions as well, through the permitting process.

1849
02:31:53,416 --> 02:31:58,120
[SPEAKER_23]: So we may not even have to do a total ordinance on it, but we could say, okay, you have to have a separate and distinct boiler.

1850
02:31:58,601 --> 02:31:59,902
[SPEAKER_23]: Another restriction is that the

1851
02:32:01,110 --> 02:32:08,313
[SPEAKER_23]: Minimum amount of square footage per unit is X. Minimum amount of bedrooms is X. There's a lot of different variables.

1852
02:32:08,373 --> 02:32:16,636
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would suggest, like Councilor Markshead and Councilor Knight, I believe, sending this to the housing subcommittee and discuss where at least we want to go.

1853
02:32:16,656 --> 02:32:19,477
[SPEAKER_23]: Because quite honestly, I don't know enough about it.

1854
02:32:20,458 --> 02:32:24,159
[SPEAKER_23]: I know that there's sometimes parking problems and stuff that may arise.

1855
02:32:24,599 --> 02:32:28,861
[SPEAKER_23]: But if you have a two-family house now and you're renting it to a couple with a baby,

1856
02:32:29,783 --> 02:32:32,668
[SPEAKER_23]: It's no different than if that couple is paying a mortgage payment each month.

1857
02:32:33,540 --> 02:32:34,341
[SPEAKER_23]: for that same unit.

1858
02:32:34,361 --> 02:32:36,162
[SPEAKER_23]: They're going to have the same number of vehicles.

1859
02:32:37,964 --> 02:32:39,425
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm looking at this.

1860
02:32:39,745 --> 02:32:42,788
[SPEAKER_23]: I really don't see the advantages and the disadvantages.

1861
02:32:43,448 --> 02:32:54,417
[SPEAKER_23]: Quite honestly, someone would maybe rather buy it so they can write off their interest on their mortgage payment per month rather than paying rent, which you can't write off.

1862
02:32:54,937 --> 02:32:57,019
[SPEAKER_23]: And there's just so many different things.

1863
02:32:57,059 --> 02:33:01,062
[SPEAKER_23]: I just think the appropriate place to vet this out and see where we're going is the

1864
02:33:02,490 --> 02:33:03,230
[SPEAKER_23]: is the subcommittee.

1865
02:33:03,610 --> 02:33:06,271
[SPEAKER_23]: In Councilor Penta's question, that's a valid question.

1866
02:33:06,631 --> 02:33:07,712
[SPEAKER_23]: That could be answered that evening.

1867
02:33:08,392 --> 02:33:12,473
[SPEAKER_23]: City solicitor might say, as you indicated, no, this can't be done.

1868
02:33:13,113 --> 02:33:17,075
[SPEAKER_23]: And then we can look at maybe restrictions, the separate boiler, the this, the that.

1869
02:33:18,495 --> 02:33:25,037
[SPEAKER_23]: So I know there is some state laws I'm not 100% sure on, but water meters, I believe you have to have separate

1870
02:33:25,511 --> 02:33:33,533
[SPEAKER_23]: electric meter maybe, but I'd be only fooling all of us if I pretended to know what I'm talking about on this particular matter.

1871
02:33:33,873 --> 02:33:37,774
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just think we should vet this out at the appropriate subcommittee.

1872
02:33:39,594 --> 02:33:41,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have a motion on the floor?

1873
02:33:41,714 --> 02:33:46,075
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I certainly have no problem with the matter going to the subcommittee, provided the subcommittee meets within the next 14 days.

1874
02:33:46,095 --> 02:33:47,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

1875
02:33:48,036 --> 02:33:53,957
[SPEAKER_07]: So we send it to the motion of council night to be sent to the subcommittee on, well it could be zoning or housing.

1876
02:33:53,977 --> 02:33:54,497
[SPEAKER_23]: Housing.

1877
02:33:54,893 --> 02:33:59,156
[SPEAKER_07]: on housing and elder affairs, chaired by Councilor Penta.

1878
02:33:59,716 --> 02:34:01,197
[SPEAKER_07]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1879
02:34:02,297 --> 02:34:03,018
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1880
02:34:03,498 --> 02:34:04,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion carries.

1881
02:34:05,039 --> 02:34:06,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all very much tonight.

1882
02:34:07,220 --> 02:34:13,564
[SPEAKER_07]: We now move to petitions, presentations, and similar matters, and we invite Ms.

1883
02:34:13,604 --> 02:34:14,805
[SPEAKER_07]: Jean Martin to the podium.

1884
02:34:15,297 --> 02:34:17,019
[SPEAKER_07]: to state her name and address for the record.

1885
02:34:17,199 --> 02:34:17,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1886
02:34:17,659 --> 02:34:18,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1887
02:34:18,941 --> 02:34:27,669
[SPEAKER_16]: And because this is a political year and we're so close to the election, I would ask that I make my statement, but nobody comments because it'll give you guys a disadvantage.

1888
02:34:27,870 --> 02:34:34,216
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the people at home, a disadvantage, all the people that aren't here, a disadvantage that you guys get to comment and

1889
02:34:34,992 --> 02:34:37,173
[SPEAKER_16]: and rally with me on a new topic.

1890
02:34:37,673 --> 02:34:41,675
[SPEAKER_16]: The new topic is the leadership model for the city.

1891
02:34:42,695 --> 02:34:44,136
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1892
02:34:45,156 --> 02:34:46,417
[SPEAKER_16]: No, no, I don't want you to comment.

1893
02:34:47,577 --> 02:34:50,598
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I wouldn't, because you'll have an advantage over somebody who might be at fault.

1894
02:34:50,618 --> 02:34:51,939
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, point of information, Mr. President.

1895
02:34:51,979 --> 02:34:53,700
[SPEAKER_23]: Point of information, Councilor Camuso.

1896
02:34:53,900 --> 02:35:01,083
[SPEAKER_23]: With all due respect, if the young lady wants to discuss a topic, and that's her discretion, it's on the agenda.

1897
02:35:02,128 --> 02:35:07,693
[SPEAKER_23]: To say that councillors should not discuss the topic that's brought up, I can't support that at all.

1898
02:35:08,094 --> 02:35:10,516
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is a city council meeting.

1899
02:35:10,536 --> 02:35:11,657
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a city council meeting.

1900
02:35:11,677 --> 02:35:13,199
[SPEAKER_16]: Such a request would be under order.

1901
02:35:13,219 --> 02:35:13,899
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a valid point.

1902
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:14,880
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a fair point.

1903
02:35:15,201 --> 02:35:16,001
[SPEAKER_16]: So with that in mind.

1904
02:35:16,202 --> 02:35:18,123
[SPEAKER_23]: And with all due respect, this is an open meeting.

1905
02:35:18,424 --> 02:35:22,448
[SPEAKER_23]: So anyone that wants to run for office can come right through that door, just as you did last election.

1906
02:35:24,349 --> 02:35:24,590
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1907
02:35:24,950 --> 02:35:26,752
[SPEAKER_23]: No, you can come down and discuss these issues.

1908
02:35:27,241 --> 02:35:27,981
[SPEAKER_16]: OK, oh, yeah, yeah.

1909
02:35:28,261 --> 02:35:30,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, anyway, with that point, no, no, no, that's a good point.

1910
02:35:30,762 --> 02:35:33,943
