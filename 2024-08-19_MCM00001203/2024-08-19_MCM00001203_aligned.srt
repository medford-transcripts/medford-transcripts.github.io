1
00:00:01,093 --> 00:00:04,175
So I think it's 1.33, I think we'll begin.

2
00:00:04,195 --> 00:00:28,988
I just wanna make a statement that pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12th, 2020 order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, General Law Chapter 30A, Subchapter 18, and the Governor's March 15th, 2020 order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in any one place

10
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:38,211
Uh, I now will call the meeting of the method license commission to order.

11
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:49,117
Um, and, uh, we would like to just take attendance for whoever is, uh, participating in this, um, zoom call.

12
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:52,499
So if you could identify yourself, Alicia, you've already done so.

13
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:52,939
Thank you.

14
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:53,459
If, um,

15
00:01:54,827 --> 00:02:00,389
rest of the people that are on the call could identify themselves and what their purpose is for the meeting.

16
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,491
I'd be happy to proceed.

17
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:09,152
You're on mute, whoever's speaking.

18
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:10,112
Dominic, are you speaking?

19
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:10,652
You're on mute.

20
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:11,393

Dominic?

27
00:02:36,651 --> 00:02:37,272
You're on mute.

28
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:40,554
You're on mute.

29
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,477
Oh, can you hear me now?

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,341
I can hear you now.

31
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:48,061
Okay.

32
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:48,721
How are you?

33
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:49,381
Good.

34
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:50,222
How are you, Dominic?

35
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:50,682
Good.

36
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:51,162
Thank you.

37
00:02:51,182 --> 00:02:53,323
Good to see you all safe and sound and healthy.

38
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:54,903
Dominic Camaro, Chamber of Commerce.

39
00:02:54,983 --> 00:02:59,645
I'm on the committee with the restaurant, et cetera, et cetera.

40
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:00,025
Thank you.

41
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:01,125
Awesome.

42
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:01,545
Thank you.

43
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:02,265
Thank you.

44
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:04,246
Denise Baker.

45
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:17,042
Denise?

46
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:17,903
Can't hear.

47
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:24,066
Oh, Denise, we can't hear you.

48
00:03:25,007 --> 00:03:25,447
Can't hear.

49
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:29,949
Unmute yourself, Denise.

50
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:34,091
Still can't hear, Denise.

51
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,334
It's weird because she's not muted, so I don't know why.

52
00:03:38,354 --> 00:03:39,354
She said one second.

53
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:40,135
OK.

54
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:42,176
It's a technical problem on her end.

55
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:43,072
Okay.

56
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:43,433
Thank you.

57
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:44,253
I renamed her.

58
00:03:44,313 --> 00:03:45,934
Cause I know she's with Salvatore's.

59
00:03:46,555 --> 00:03:46,835
Yes.

60
00:03:47,415 --> 00:03:47,675
Okay.

61
00:03:47,956 --> 00:03:48,256
Thank you.

62
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:49,657
We'll come back to a real gusto.

63
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:51,058
Yeah.

64
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:51,298
Hello.

65
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:52,319
This is Matteo Ron's.

66
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:53,279
You're from real gusto.

67
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,100
Can you hear me?

68
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,441
Yes, I can hear you fine.

69
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:56,521
Thank you.

70
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:56,882
Thank you.

71
00:03:56,922 --> 00:03:58,343
Thank you very much for this meeting.

72
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:04,067
And yeah, we are here to ask for the understood.

73
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:04,907
Thank you.

74
00:04:05,808 --> 00:04:06,408
Ken Krauss.

75
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:11,752
Ken Krauss.

76
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,166
Ken, you're on mute.

77
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:13,547
OK.

78
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,410
Ken Kraus.

79
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:25,072
All right, moving right along.

80
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:25,812
Sean Began.

81
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,535
Yeah, hello, Sean Began, 362 Lawrence Road.

82
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,596
I'm an attorney in Medford.

83
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:37,478
I do represent Carroll's, as well as a number of other businesses in the square.

84
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:45,266
I'm on this call just for general information purposes, as well as to listen in on Maury's behalf as well.

85
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:46,267
Okay.

86
00:04:47,448 --> 00:04:48,368
I think that's everybody.

87
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:50,610
Yes.

88
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,510
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,071
Go ahead, Daria.

90
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:53,752
No, I was going to say, I believe so.

91
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:54,012
Yes.

92
00:04:54,072 --> 00:05:00,936
And then we also have, um, I'm blinking just recording the life.

93
00:05:01,096 --> 00:05:01,437
Sorry.

94
00:05:01,937 --> 00:05:02,217
Okay.

95
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:02,857
All right.

96
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:03,358
No problem.

97
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:14,749
So moving right ahead, first thing on our agenda is to approve the minutes from the May 20th, 2020 meeting, which have been distributed.

98
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:18,575
Motion is now in order.

99
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,510
Yeah, Daria, thank you for putting the minutes together.

100
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,612
Was that our first Zoom meeting?

101
00:05:23,952 --> 00:05:24,592
I can't remember.

102
00:05:24,672 --> 00:05:25,613
Was that our second one?

103
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:28,455
But nevertheless, thank you, Daria, for doing that.

104
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:36,001
The minutes are concise and accurate, and I motion to approve the minutes as they were written.

105
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:38,263
Yeah, I second that.

106
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:39,043
Thank you.

107
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:47,030
And then I don't know if you guys saw that Kent Cross doesn't have a working mic.

108
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,471
He's just an interested citizen.

109
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:53,245
Fine with me, it's okay.

110
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:53,986
Thank you.

111
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:57,609
The minutes have been motioned and seconded.

112
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:59,510
So those minutes have been approved.

113
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:10,439
First item on my agenda is the representative from Long Cross, Byron Kitchen at 501 Felsway for an alteration of premises.

114
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:12,641
Is there anybody?

115
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:16,524
No, no, that's the list I got.

116
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:24,243
I went by the list that I got from Alicia, two days ago before doing that john, when I did agenda.

117
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:28,824
So I don't think, Alicia, they're not.

118
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:32,105
Do they do you know if they have outside premises.

119
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:37,446
I know there was some confusion between that outside premises.

120
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:47,037
Um, I do not have a list of whether or not they have an outdoor liquor license yet.

121
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:47,978
Okay.

122
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,481
All right.

123
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:52,643
So they did not file an application then Daria?

124
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:53,785
No, they did not.

125
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:54,926
All right.

126
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:59,031
So next one on my agenda is the Porch Southern Fair in Duke.

127
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:00,479
They didn't either.

128
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:01,679
They do not either.

129
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,782
Yeah, Alicia sent it to me, but they didn't file it.

130
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:05,742
They didn't file?

131
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:10,386
They're on the list from the clerk's office.

132
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:21,654
So there are several where we believe the health department, building department, think that they've already had for many years outdoor dining and liquor license.

133
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:34,640
And that's the the porch Bertucci Razzos semolina and snappy patties But we haven't had access to an elect like a list anyway, right?

134
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:47,086
Yeah And then I remember when we approved long cross their plans showed outside dining to remember all along the back end of the restaurant, so Yeah

135
00:07:50,457 --> 00:08:01,727
We thought maybe they did because they came in to the place that was not your average Joe's, but we have not been able to get anybody to confirm that for us.

136
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:04,830
And they told us they had a liquor license, but I'd like that.

137
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:05,970
Sure.

138
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:07,192
No, no, I get it.

139
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:11,035
No.

140
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:15,279
So the next one I have on my agenda that is real gusto.

141
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:16,540
Yes.

142
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:19,456
I have them as well.

143
00:08:19,856 --> 00:08:22,378
They have their application and they are present?

144
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,381
Yes.

145
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:31,365
If they could explain their alteration, that would be very much appreciated.

146
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:42,422
Yeah, well, we have a back alley, and we got the authorization from the landlord to use it.

147
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:48,284
And then we have two small balconies that I think, in the end, are inside.

148
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:54,685
But we are asking for the, let's say, the patio we would like to put outside.

149
00:08:55,205 --> 00:09:05,292
The thing is that now the health department, they didn't get us the approval for the COVID-19.

150
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:13,218
So what's happening is that we are asking for this license in order to open after this.

151
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:19,803
So it's like something more hopefully for the near future.

152
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:23,666
But now we are just opening two balconies in the restaurant.

153
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:26,922
two balconies off the restaurant?

154
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:27,403
Yeah.

155
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:29,643
Is this to the rear overlooking the river?

156
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:30,263
Yeah.

157
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,404
And how many tables can you put on those two balconies?

158
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:38,926
Just two tables for, let's say six, two tables for three.

159
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:40,826
Two tables for three.

160
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:42,367
Okay.

161
00:09:43,547 --> 00:09:48,568
So you're not looking to expand to any other spot, the sidewalk out front or anything else?

162
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,049
You just want two balconies

163
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,711
Yeah, sorry, not in the front.

164
00:09:53,191 --> 00:10:00,074
We think it's not a nice place to put tables in the front of 24th High Street.

165
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:11,298
We are thinking after the COVID-19 to open in the back alley, that is 20th High Street, and I think we already sent all the documentation.

166
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:13,019
about these seats.

167
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:21,285
The thing is that we don't have the nine feet that are requested for the COVID-19 issue.

168
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:39,800
So yesterday we talked to Melanie and to John and they suggested us to ask for this license for the future, also for these spots and in that spots we are going to have five tables, so ten seats.

169
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:45,939
But all you're looking for today is, my question for you is, how do you access the balcony?

170
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,485
Where you're gonna have two... I mean, there's two big windows.

171
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:55,107
It's like an open room.

172
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:58,250
I understand that, but I've actually eaten at your restaurant several times.

173
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:02,374
But to get to the balcony, you gotta walk through the restaurant, correct?

174
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:03,235
Yeah, correct.

175
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:08,059
See, that's what... That is allowed by the health department.

176
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:08,882
Right.

177
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:16,028
Um, it is allowed by the health department, but that is not necessarily the intent of what the governor wanted.

178
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:19,030
The governor asked for open dining.

179
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:26,276
If you are trans transitioning from the restaurant to get to a balcony for six people, is that what you're saying?

180
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:27,217
Yeah.

181
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:30,760
Um, that sort of is not

182
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,941
the intent of what the spirit is of this.

183
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:41,584
So how do you prevent people from stopping and sitting down while they're waiting to sit for the six tables out back, six seats?

184
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:46,626
There is no seats available on the dining room or at the bar.

185
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,346
It's just like a book.

186
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:49,487
You've taken all those away.

187
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:55,609
Yeah, I mean, I'm taking all the seats on the tables and everything is not accessible for other people to sit.

188
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:58,909
It's just a long way.

189
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,131
It's just a long walk to reach the balconies.

190
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:08,632
For six parties, I mean, a table of three and three, six people.

191
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:11,553
Yeah, six people that are very far from each other.

192
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:12,293
I mean, so.

193
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:15,556
So there is enough room.

194
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:19,799
I mean, yesterday, we had the meeting with Melanie from the Bordeaux Health.

195
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:22,741
They were more than comfortable about this thing.

196
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:23,541
Right.

197
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,942
Well, they can be comfortable with it.

198
00:12:24,982 --> 00:12:25,983
They're dealing with the food.

199
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:27,304
We're dealing with the liquor.

200
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,105
Yeah.

201
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:33,688
I mean, the barcodes are closed.

202
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:37,711
So there is no way that people can get out without, I mean, noise.

203
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:42,915
I mean, closed balconies.

204
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:46,246
overlooking the river.

205
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:48,227
Ben, you had a question?

206
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:51,909
So it's just the two tables that you'll be able to get open?

207
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:52,509
Yeah.

208
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,190
Unfortunately, just two.

209
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,111
But it's something.

210
00:12:55,171 --> 00:13:02,514
In this time, also two tables is something compared to nothing.

211
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:05,336
This is kind of a question to maybe the commissioners, but does the

212
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:19,763
Governor make a rule I mean does, like do they include open, maybe we'll get to this with some of the doors, where you know, maybe wants to mute it.

213
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:24,507
You know, open doors count is outside.

214
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:28,631
It's outside, the two balconies are outside of the premises.

215
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,072
Yeah, it's outside.

216
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:31,033
You know, it's outside.

217
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:33,435
Okay, I thought it was just open doors.

218
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:36,457
No, no, it's just you go outside.

219
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:48,908
Yeah, but Jim, to your point, I understand it's almost like it's a loose interpretation because you're cutting through the restaurant to get outside versus approaching the restaurant and you're already outside, but

220
00:13:49,729 --> 00:14:00,556
But I believe if he's taken the steps to remove tables and chairs to keep people from loitering and sitting down, then, you know, I'm comfortable with that.

221
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:06,320
Also, if the Board of Health has looked at it,

222
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:17,094
Again, I know it's kind of turning the rule or the guideline or the law inside out, but I don't see a problem with that.

223
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:25,741
I just wish we had, a long time ago, developed a river and developed like a boardwalk along the back so we'd be able to access it from the back.

224
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,643
But that's another point.

225
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:33,127
I mean, for sure we are doing everything to make it happen.

226
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:36,690
Yeah.

227
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:53,199
Yeah, I mean, I guess for two tables and, you know, for the liquor service, I don't see that, you know, I don't, I don't have a problem with it.

228
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,481
So let me just add one other thing.

229
00:14:55,561 --> 00:15:08,350
Everybody realizes that any license that's being entertained today will expire at the earlier of November, 2020 or at the governor's, um, reversal of his order.

230
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:16,237
Um, and also, um, if there are any violations relative to the liquor licensing.

231
00:15:17,197 --> 00:15:31,263
Authority today, everybody agrees without any hearing, um, at, at the, um, suggestion of the alcoholic beverage control commission.

232
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:34,845
Everybody understand?

233
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:34,925
Yes.

234
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:35,805
Yes.

235
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:52,735
So, um, as long as, uh, real gusto understands if there's people sitting inside that restaurant waiting for a table that, in my opinion, is a violation of the governor's order for open seating.

236
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,338
I think you do qualify for the open seating out back.

237
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,543
And, um, I think you are entitled to have people sitting out there.

238
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:08,530
But I think sitting any other place, regardless of what the Board of Health has to say, is a potential violation.

239
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,110
Understood.

240
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:18,932
We are doing just, in order to avoid anyone waiting, we are working just on reservation only.

241
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:19,892
I got it.

242
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:20,752
That makes sense.

243
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,033
So like three shifts, 4 p.m., 6 p.m., 8 p.m.

244
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:28,614
So people never, I think, get each other.

245
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:29,054
That's fine.

246
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:30,675
I think you're doing the right thing.

247
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:31,395
Jim?

248
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:32,627
Yes.

249
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:35,109
Jim, hi.

250
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:40,793
Also, for optics, for the sake of optics, I understand your position exactly, and I don't blame you for bringing that out.

251
00:16:42,054 --> 00:16:54,724
What if Mateo were to put, you know, those nice little things that look like you create with little sticks and with a tape or something that would make it look like a car or that you can't possibly, you know, go left or right of it directly to that.

252
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:59,287
If he were to do that, at least... I think that's a good suggestion.

253
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:01,766
I think that's a good suggestion, Dominic.

254
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:10,149
I'm just trying to protect the license holders in the city so we don't issue a license and then have a misunderstanding down the road.

255
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:13,430
I think that would be disastrous for what the intent is here.

256
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:21,134
The intent is to try to give these restaurants a leg up so they can get up and operating and opening without waiting for the next phase to open.

257
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:25,195
So anything like that, I think, would be very helpful in the whole process.

258
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:25,856
Yes.

259
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:28,156
I think the objects are important.

260
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:28,417
Yeah.

261
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:29,317
Yeah.

262
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:31,795
Okay.

263
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:32,055
Thank you.

264
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,056
Thank you.

265
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:33,956
Any further questions?

266
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:36,037
I'm good.

267
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:36,457
Okay.

268
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:37,358
Yeah.

269
00:17:37,378 --> 00:17:40,779
So, uh, I motion to accept the, uh, alteration of premises.

270
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,261
Okay.

271
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:50,483
License is granted for the alteration of premises.

272
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:55,726
Um, the next item I have on my agenda is snappy patties.

273
00:17:57,406 --> 00:18:01,068
Obviously, um, you know, this is all subject to the board of health as Alicia said,

274
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:05,213
Um, you know, and, uh, I assume you're working your way through that.

275
00:18:06,414 --> 00:18:08,995
Um, next one I have on my agenda is snappy patties.

276
00:18:11,076 --> 00:18:27,482
Snappy patties has informed us that they are intending to use their existing outdoor dining area, which we understand already has an outdoor dining alcohol license permit, and they're not going to expand any further beyond their existing footprint.

277
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:28,302
Fine.

278
00:18:28,622 --> 00:18:29,443
Thank you very much.

279
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:30,263
Thank you.

280
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:36,026
So now we will take on a, I guess, a first come first serve basis.

281
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:40,691
Any other pending applicants in no particular order?

282
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:45,936
I got my audio to work.

283
00:18:45,976 --> 00:18:48,278
If you can hear me, have the floor, Denise.

284
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:53,318
Thank you so much.

285
00:18:53,358 --> 00:19:05,703
So I put in an application for outdoor seating out back behind the restaurant, take advantage of four of the parking spots that parallel the back of the building.

286
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:18,929
But for ADA compliance, I will need to have a couple out front because that's the only access that anybody who's mobility challenge can get into the restaurant.

287
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:27,757
Okay, have you- I'm sorry, Denise, how many, four spots out back, two spots in front?

288
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:38,343
No, four of the parking spots, Alan, but I was hoping to use the sidewalk out front because the sidewalk is nine feet in diameter.

289
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:39,163
Okay.

290
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:44,106
And my tables are about two feet wide, so that does give about seven feet clearance.

291
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:48,028
Okay, and how many individuals?

292
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,353
So a total front and back, Alan?

293
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:55,374
Yeah.

294
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:59,257
So total front and back, if I do my math correctly, about 25.

295
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,939
And that still gives us six feet apart.

296
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,780
Okay, thank you.

297
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,402
Denise, could you just walk me through the four parking spaces?

298
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:08,743
How many tables go up there?

299
00:20:08,763 --> 00:20:10,404
That's what I wanted to know.

300
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:12,485
Yeah, so I did the math.

301
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:17,709
So if I squeeze, if I do six feet apart, because the tables that I have are about,

302
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:24,464
not more than any two feet in diameter and the stools are pretty small too.

303
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:44,212
So if I go along the four spots, I could do, like I could get four into one spot, then, I'm sorry, eight into one, two in the next, eight into one, two in the next by spreading them six feet apart.

304
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:45,413
Okay.

305
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:47,814
And how many out front?

306
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:52,458
I could fit five if I needed to, but that would be the max.

307
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:55,322
Six feet apart and get five.

308
00:20:55,562 --> 00:20:55,843
Okay.

309
00:20:56,544 --> 00:20:57,465
Let me ask another question.

310
00:20:57,505 --> 00:21:00,849
Have you got permission from the city for the parking lot and the sidewalk?

311
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:02,231
Maybe.

312
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:04,643
Denise, if I might.

313
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:12,406
So we are working through that process and advise Denise to talk to you in a parallel process.

314
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:16,667
So we're working with Todd Blake, our traffic planner, to lay it out.

315
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:20,288
And we're getting ready to take it to the traffic commission.

316
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:25,229
But we advise her to speak with you at the same time that we're going to.

317
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,990
I think that makes a lot of sense, Alicia.

318
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:35,712
Because whatever decision we make here, Denise, would be subject to whatever the city passes judgment on the parking lot and the sidewalk.

319
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:37,912
Of course.

320
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:39,293
So just along those lines.

321
00:21:44,494 --> 00:21:55,776
So alcohol that would be delivered to the parking lot would be delivered from your bar area up the back staircase to the parking lot.

322
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:02,310
And what steps would you take to make sure that alcohol doesn't leave the four parking spots?

323
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:06,431
The same steps that I would is for inside.

324
00:22:07,412 --> 00:22:12,514
I'd be training with my staff and I would have two managers on every shift.

325
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:15,435
So one could monitor out back and one could monitor out front.

326
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:18,756
And the same is true.

327
00:22:19,516 --> 00:22:21,797
Would you have somebody out back at all times?

328
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:26,673
Yeah, I mean, unless I get, you know, one of us get called in, but that's the idea.

329
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:30,635
So one all back and one out front, potentially.

330
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:32,136
Thank you.

331
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:34,858
Do you put any questions out, Ben?

332
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:35,338
Go ahead.

333
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:40,101
Yeah, I was wondering, Denise, do you put partitions like, or something like that, or?

334
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:52,328
Yeah, so what I had done is, in a call, speaking to Alicia and a few other people, I had asked if the city could loan me some saw horses.

335
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:56,725
to kind of section the parking spots off.

336
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:02,587
And then I was also looking into like a freestanding tent area.

337
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:09,509
And maybe as we go along, maybe some kind of even fencing or something.

338
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,751
You know, I'm glad you brought up the tent, Denise.

339
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:20,573
One of the things that the ABCC, I've been in contact with them, as you might imagine, almost every day this week.

340
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:22,714
If you do have a tent,

341
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:26,859
you are not allowed to have more than two sides on the tent.

342
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:30,960
The ones I was thinking of have no sides at all.

343
00:23:31,341 --> 00:23:35,502
In their opinion, if you have four sides and we're bound to have rain at some point, right?

344
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:39,543
Then it becomes a closed dining experience, which is not allowed.

345
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:43,605
So just keep that in the back of your mind if you decide to put up a tent.

346
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,267
Allen, Brian, Ben, any?

347
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:52,682
Yeah, no, I get it.

348
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:59,925
I'm happy you're talking about fencing because that was one of our concerns with Snappy Patty when they were talking about moving out back.

349
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:04,867
We were concerned that someone might hit the gas pedal rather than the brake.

350
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:09,549
So I'm glad you are taking steps for that area.

351
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:11,149
No, I'm fine.

352
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:12,710
I don't have any other questions.

353
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:17,557
Yeah, I'm kind of lucky because my brother happens to be in the fence business.

354
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:21,320
Oh yeah, get him over there.

355
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,161
Yeah, that doesn't hurt, Denise.

356
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:25,902
Right?

357
00:24:26,863 --> 00:24:27,323
That's right.

358
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:28,664
That's right, that's all good.

359
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:31,665
Yeah, I don't have any other questions.

360
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:32,906
No other questions, Ben?

361
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,147
Alan, no other questions?

362
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:42,291
No, I think it's smart and it's a good solution to the nightmare that we're all trying to get through.

363
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:42,992
Right.

364
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:44,025
Mark.

365
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:44,525
Yeah.

366
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:45,745
Okay.

367
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:46,946
So motion would be in order.

368
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:48,966
Uh, again, yeah.

369
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:53,787
I'd, I'd motion, uh, for alter premises, uh, for Salvatore's restaurant.

370
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:54,847
Okay.

371
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:56,808
I would second the motion.

372
00:24:57,348 --> 00:24:58,188
Okay.

373
00:24:58,588 --> 00:25:08,730
And again, subject to the city of Medford's confirmation, Denise and, and all of the other things that I said, it expires November of 2020, unless extended by the governor.

374
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,590
And, um, so that's fine.

375
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:12,971
So the alteration has been approved.

376
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:13,990
Thank you.

377
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:15,011
You're welcome.

378
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:16,072
Good luck.

379
00:25:16,452 --> 00:25:16,832
Thank you.

380
00:25:16,852 --> 00:25:17,673
Good luck.

381
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:18,193
Yeah.

382
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,936
Next morning, Carol.

383
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:25,899
Good afternoon, Mari.

384
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:26,539
Good.

385
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:26,979
Thank you.

386
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:31,202
So just give us a little background of where you are.

387
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:37,287
We have applied for the outside service of alcohol service.

388
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:38,627
It's,

389
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:47,864
It is our plan to use the sidewalk in front of the restaurant, going towards the crowded bridge.

390
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:52,845
We're waiting for DCR to give us approval.

391
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:59,886
They're supposed to, their legal department is far as coming out with approval for using the bridge.

392
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:08,928
And I guess it's a blanket liability thing that they're doing for this circumstance throughout the state for all their property.

393
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,371
How far over the bridge would you like to go, Murray?

394
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:15,732
Probably just about halfway up to the first pillar.

395
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:18,913
We don't want to get too overextended there.

396
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:27,756
It's got to be one of those situations where, you know, we have to set it up in the afternoon and break it down when we're done at night time, bring everything in.

397
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:30,897
So, you know, we're just trying to take a little bit of the curse off.

398
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:31,757
I get it.

399
00:26:32,337 --> 00:26:34,738
How many tables would you like to get, Murray?

400
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:42,480
I think we're somewhere, we measured it without actually putting tables out there and that always changes.

401
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,662
The area seems to shrink when you get the tables out there.

402
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:49,365
But my guess is we're somewhere around 15 two-tops.

403
00:26:51,607 --> 00:26:53,628
When you say two-tops, two person per table?

404
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:55,449
Yeah, yeah, 15 deuces.

405
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,133
We're going to put them right up against the building and against the railing on the bridge.

406
00:27:00,694 --> 00:27:04,358
If we have to bring one in for a party of four, we'll be pulling there.

407
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:11,826
But judging with the six foot clearance that we need to create between tables, I'm thinking somewhere around 15.

408
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:21,155
And Mari, as you look at your front door, except for the window to the right of your front door, is it predominantly seating going to the left as you look at your front door?

409
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:23,516
It is.

410
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:26,399
We're going to have, we'll have our managers will be out there.

411
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:28,741
They'll be greeting the guests, seating them.

412
00:27:29,421 --> 00:27:31,343
There's obviously no waiting area.

413
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:32,644
We'll be taking phone numbers.

414
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:35,387
If there is a wait, they'll have to wait in their car.

415
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:40,171
We'll text them or call them to let them know that there is a table available.

416
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:48,178
We're going to kind of go with the 90 minute rule that everyone seems to be existing on as far as table occupancy.

417
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:50,560
So we can kind of do a little bit of a turn.

418
00:27:51,396 --> 00:27:59,892
We've come out with a more limited menu that's more conducive to outdoor dining than our regular heavy menu that we serve inside.

419
00:28:01,194 --> 00:28:03,478
You're not going to move any tables towards high street.

420
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:05,617
they're all gonna go straight.

421
00:28:05,737 --> 00:28:06,698
No, we're going the other way.

422
00:28:06,738 --> 00:28:07,518
We're going the other way.

423
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:11,719
Too much congestion down there.

424
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:25,482
Maury, you said the first pillar, I can't, there's scaffolding set up by my bank, so I can't look out the window and look at the bridge, but the first pillar, is that a quarter of the way onto the bridge or halfway onto the bridge?

425
00:28:26,062 --> 00:28:27,042
Like I said, I can't see it.

426
00:28:27,843 --> 00:28:29,423
I think it's around a third of the way, Alan.

427
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:31,068
A third, okay.

428
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:33,429
Yeah, we're right deficit right in that window.

429
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:34,430
I'm not exactly sure.

430
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:53,077
Okay, so you can't get halfway out to the bridge that's too ambitious or no way or I don't think at this point we want to go that far and stretch us out this that far, you know, we're still limited on staff and what we can do and, you know, if need be that we have to go halfway with certainly, you know,

431
00:28:55,054 --> 00:28:57,796
take a look at it.

432
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:06,884
Not for me to tell you your own business, but could you go for half of it and if you don't use it, at least you got that in your back pocket in case everything takes off?

433
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:11,528
Oh, absolutely.

434
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:11,989
Okay.

435
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:13,110
Dominic's got a question.

436
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:14,770
through the chair.

437
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,454
Listen, I can't wait for this to happen because to me, and I can't wait to go out.

438
00:29:18,474 --> 00:29:24,441
I've done it because I, you know, I wasn't going to go to a restaurant, but it's going to seem as though I'm sitting in the Ponte Vecchio in Florence.

439
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:27,904
Once he sets up, I think that's going to be great for Matt.

440
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:28,845
Oh my goodness.

441
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:29,466
I can't wait.

442
00:29:29,987 --> 00:29:31,869
All you need is the gondola is going underneath.

443
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:41,497
If we can get Roland to move some of his jewelry over there, then we got the Ponte Vecchio.

444
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:42,198
That's right.

445
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:42,678
That's right.

446
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:43,239
That's right.

447
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:45,903
All those jewelry stores up and down the Ponte Vecchio, right?

448
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:46,364
That's right.

449
00:29:47,646 --> 00:30:00,390
As I said to Denise, Mari, I'm just concerned about the alcohol staying where it's served to, you know, in light of, and I hope it's tremendously successful as Dominic said.

450
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:14,514
I plan to coordinate office, you know, we're coming out with planters in between, where the seating area is and our restricted area as far as serving, that will be the dividing line.

451
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,931
We have enough staff and experienced staff.

452
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:21,573
We've been doing this all week.

453
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,215
And you've both done a good job.

454
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:26,397
Everybody on this Zoom call has done a good job at dispensing alcohol.

455
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:30,821
I'm just suggesting it's a new era and a new, just be aware, that's all.

456
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,042
I hear you exactly, Jimmy.

457
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,324
I know exactly what you're saying and appreciate that.

458
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:36,185
Yep.

459
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,748
I don't have any other further questions, Alan or Ben?

460
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:41,109
No, no, I'm good.

461
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,991
Ben, you want to make the motion or you want me to do it?

462
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,632
Um, yeah, I'll make the motion.

463
00:30:47,153 --> 00:30:54,321
It's, uh, alteration of, uh, premises, premises, changing premises.

464
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,022
I'll just make that motion.

465
00:30:57,544 --> 00:31:01,088
I seconded all those in approval.

466
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:02,529
None.

467
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,952
Your application has been approved.

468
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:06,474
Thank you very much.

469
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:07,015
Yeah.

470
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:10,136
Again, Maury, like same, same thing to Denise.

471
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:12,978
Very creative, very smart.

472
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,999
Uh, I applaud you for thinking outside the box.

473
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,001
We do the best we can right now.

474
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:21,462
Yeah, exactly.

475
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:24,943
Hey, thanks so much gentlemen.

476
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:25,724
Appreciate all your help.

477
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:26,344
You're welcome.

478
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,505
Peter, I think you're up.

479
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:31,066
Can you hear me?

480
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:31,667
Thank you.

481
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:32,527
Yeah, I can't hear you.

482
00:31:33,412 --> 00:31:38,955
Peter, if you could just tell us a little bit about, although I ride by it every day, so I pretty got a pretty good sense.

483
00:31:38,975 --> 00:31:42,978
Why don't you tell everybody what's involved with the R application?

484
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:49,021
I'm looking for maybe eight tables, 16 chairs out there on private property.

485
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:51,083
That's right in front of the restaurant.

486
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:53,824
Yep.

487
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:56,386
And Alicia, I think the Board of Health is involved in

488
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,956
in each one of these applications.

489
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:05,480
So, so this, whoever's a parent today, I assume is not a surprise to the board of health.

490
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,282
They visited all of these locations.

491
00:32:08,402 --> 00:32:09,243
Thank you.

492
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:14,146
Uh, Avalino's is private and, um, state property.

493
00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:17,968
So we're aware that they're working with the state for permission.

494
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:20,670
And we're aware of Salvatore's requests.

495
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:24,392
Sorry, Harold's requests to the state as well.

496
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:25,233
Thank you.

497
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:28,906
So Peter, I know you said it a minute ago, but I didn't have my pen in my hand.

498
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:29,466
How many seats?

499
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:32,786
Eight tables, 16 seats.

500
00:32:33,426 --> 00:32:33,806
Thank you.

501
00:32:39,788 --> 00:32:43,368
It seems like you have, do you already have any outdoor seating there?

502
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:49,269
Is there is that we just, we, we put a couple of tables out yesterday to see how it would go, but that was it.

503
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:49,829
Yeah.

504
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,550
No, we never had in the past.

505
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,130
No, no.

506
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:56,239
It's just intimidating out there with the mystic gap being like a straight shot.

507
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,982
It's intimidating for me to do outside seating out there.

508
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:05,346
And I would have loved to brought in maybe Jersey barriers this time here to kind of like off a bit.

509
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:08,388
If somebody rolls up on there, that would be, you know, scary.

510
00:33:08,748 --> 00:33:12,951
Um, but before I did any of that, I just wanted to make sure I got proper permission.

511
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:14,692
Sure.

512
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,533
Well, it is private property.

513
00:33:16,573 --> 00:33:18,955
So that, you know, eliminates that discussion.

514
00:33:19,936 --> 00:33:21,637
Um, and, um,

515
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:29,022
Again, the only thing, as I said to the others, Peter, is just watching the alcohol because it is out in the public area.

516
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,603
But short of that, I don't have any other questions.

517
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:34,383
To be honest with you, we're not a big alcohol facility, as you know.

518
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:35,203
Yeah, I know.

519
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:36,243
I know.

520
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:38,044
Peter, good luck.

521
00:33:38,864 --> 00:33:40,044
Through the chair, Peter, good luck.

522
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:42,605
And hello to the girls, all my fellow students.

523
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:44,705
I wish you all the best luck.

524
00:33:44,765 --> 00:33:46,725
And I know how all of you have suffered, Peter.

525
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:47,705
Thank you very much.

526
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:48,686
We love you.

527
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:49,686
We'll get through it.

528
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:51,914
You will get through it.

529
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:53,515
We'll all get through it together.

530
00:33:53,535 --> 00:33:54,196
Yeah, that's right.

531
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:55,797
That's what we're all trying to do here.

532
00:33:55,837 --> 00:34:00,040
Mr. Chairman, this might be a good time, if you allow me to speak to Alicia and get back to her.

533
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:11,610
Last week on the same Zoom about this reopening and so on and so forth, I, with all my heart, I had offered my patio on the Mystic River, as you all know, to possibly Denise and Mari.

534
00:34:12,011 --> 00:34:16,374
And when Alicia contacted me, she said, Dominic can potentially send that.

535
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:23,058
I contacted my insurance company and my law firms and so on, and they wanted to have me committed to even thinking about it.

536
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:27,600
He says, you have no idea.

537
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,600
I said, come on.

538
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,321
But they said, no, no, no, you can't even think about it.

539
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:32,362
I said, but why?

540
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:33,462
My hat's in the right place.

541
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:34,843
And so they gave me this list.

542
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:36,123
I said, OK, OK, I get it.

543
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:36,563
I get it.

544
00:34:36,603 --> 00:34:36,984
I get it.

545
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:39,205
And unfortunately, so but who knows?

546
00:34:39,265 --> 00:34:40,485
Maybe someday, some day.

547
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:41,025
Maybe someday.

548
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:44,126
I will make it available.

549
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:48,188
I don't know we'll find a way but right now they said don't even think about it.

550
00:34:48,808 --> 00:34:53,589
I'm so sorry I shouldn't have said it but I you know I wanted to with all my heart I really did.

551
00:34:54,510 --> 00:35:02,052
The mayor's policy that has been published and actually based on advice from KP Law our lawyers is that we

552
00:35:03,472 --> 00:35:12,994
that everybody be required to have the property adjacent to theirs, so they're not comfortable with somebody walking across the street.

553
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:22,336
And then open to the public seating has its own issues because somebody has to take responsibility for cleaning the tables.

554
00:35:23,097 --> 00:35:24,677
And that's a good point, Alicia.

555
00:35:24,737 --> 00:35:27,878
I said, oh my God, okay, okay, okay, I get it, I get it.

556
00:35:29,618 --> 00:35:31,218
But like I said, my house was in the right place.

557
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:34,980
What do you think, Dominic?

558
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:40,345
Dominic, you think Denise is going to come across the street with a plate of chicken piccata and bring it in the back?

559
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:41,066
I don't know.

560
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:44,809
I think, I think maybe, maybe Colleen's or something.

561
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:48,993
I don't know what the issue is, but I might have breaks, you know, but not being right.

562
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:49,553
No, you can't.

563
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:50,834
You're outside of that.

564
00:35:51,595 --> 00:35:56,077
Pat, whatever, you can't even think about it, let alone making it available.

565
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:57,697
Okay, all right, I get it, I get it now.

566
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,638
But that's a good point, Alicia.

567
00:35:59,678 --> 00:36:04,940
The ABCC has also been very specific that it has to be contiguous.

568
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:13,843
There's no walking across the street with tables, I'm sorry, pallets of beer or wine and crossing High Street.

569
00:36:14,643 --> 00:36:16,884
It doesn't meet the test.

570
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:18,625
No, it makes sense, it makes sense.

571
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,982
So Peter, I don't have any other questions.

572
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:25,644
Mr. Chairman, can I share this pressure with my friends that I can still do that?

573
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,164
God, I can.

574
00:36:26,224 --> 00:36:26,944
Yeah, you can.

575
00:36:27,705 --> 00:36:29,926
What if I put a little sambuca, which is liquor?

576
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:32,567
Can I do that?

577
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:33,287
Oh, yeah.

578
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:35,008
No problem.

579
00:36:35,048 --> 00:36:36,208
Yeah.

580
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,132
Let's see, Ben or Alan, any questions for Peter?

581
00:36:40,673 --> 00:36:42,174
No, I don't have any questions for Peter.

582
00:36:42,194 --> 00:36:53,723
No, and I think, I mean, actually, Peter, I think you have a lot of, you probably have the most space thus far out in front of your restaurant than, you know, compared, so I'm okay with it.

583
00:36:54,284 --> 00:37:01,329
And now you'll take proper precautions and make a motion to approve the change.

584
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,551
Great, seconded?

585
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:05,032
I second it, yeah.

586
00:37:05,573 --> 00:37:06,193
All those in favor?

587
00:37:07,382 --> 00:37:07,862
Very good.

588
00:37:08,122 --> 00:37:08,962
That's approved, Peter.

589
00:37:09,402 --> 00:37:10,102
Thank you, Peter.

590
00:37:10,323 --> 00:37:11,183
Thank you, everybody.

591
00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:12,383
Thank you very much.

592
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:13,223
Thank you.

593
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:35,207
I think what we should do is, you know, given the fact that there is probably quite a few other people that probably want to come before us, the licensing commission for an alteration of premises, I think we should probably set up a weekly meeting until we satisfy the need.

594
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:45,356
Uh, so that everybody knows that we're meeting, uh, weekly until we get through this process to attempt to approve as many as possible and not tie anybody up.

595
00:37:46,536 --> 00:37:55,020
So, you know, I would like to make a motion that we, um, move, um, each week, Wednesday at one o'clock.

596
00:37:55,833 --> 00:38:06,795
for at least the next, I don't know, let's say the next two weeks anyways, to see if we can't get everybody addressed before this, so we're not the log jam in the whole process.

597
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:11,897
So starting next Wednesday, Daria, if you could set it up, Wednesday's at one o'clock.

598
00:38:12,337 --> 00:38:16,098
Yeah, we'll have a meeting next Wednesday anyways, like our regular meeting.

599
00:38:16,138 --> 00:38:17,158
Right, yeah.

600
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:22,339
But then we'll do it for a couple of weeks after that too, or we'll vote next meeting.

601
00:38:23,283 --> 00:38:35,593
But Alicia, if you could let everybody know in City Hall that we're doing that from the Board of Health and anybody else, I think it would be very helpful if everybody knows they can come in front of us on a Wednesday at one o'clock.

602
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:38,175
I think it serves the community well.

603
00:38:39,702 --> 00:38:40,322
That's great.

604
00:38:40,462 --> 00:38:53,067
And I'll just ask Daria that if you do hear from people applying, it would be great to make sure you loop, just loop me in so that I can make sure that the board of health and the building department is also aware of their application.

605
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:57,888
I'd hate to have somebody come to you and we don't realize it and we could have been looking.

606
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:02,510
I just want to keep it in sync enough.

607
00:39:03,815 --> 00:39:04,796
Yeah, that's fine.

608
00:39:04,816 --> 00:39:05,717
We've been working together.

609
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:12,383
Anyway, so we definitely have some places The best of my knowledge off the top of my head.

610
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:28,158
They're not restaurants that serve alcohol that traditionally put tables out in front and there's some concern that they may not have enough space because the guidelines at the Health Department and the building department are following or that you need a

611
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:45,185
Um six feet between the table and the walk aisle and then you need a three-foot walk aisle And so some of our sidewalks are wide enough So they're exploring some options that we are going to take to the traffic commission if the businesses are interested in

612
00:39:46,185 --> 00:39:53,772
closing the park, the parallel parking in front of their businesses to allow the greater distance and to allow tables.

613
00:39:54,152 --> 00:39:58,496
We're exploring that in some various locations to see if that's gonna be possible.

614
00:39:59,277 --> 00:40:03,781
But there are some restaurants that think that they can just put their tables out like usual.

615
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:08,685
And in fact, under COVID restrictions, they don't legally have enough space.

616
00:40:09,345 --> 00:40:11,247
So the Board of Health is following through with those.

617
00:40:11,307 --> 00:40:13,169
And that's one of the reasons why it's helpful

618
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:27,456
that if you hear from anybody to just check like send that over to us immediately so we can check on it and let you know that we're looking at it too to avoid any misconceptions about whether or not they're going to be allowed to do it.

619
00:40:27,796 --> 00:40:32,618
Are these our business partners down at uh station landing is that where some of the confusion is or

620
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:53,355
We haven't heard from any, so I just want you to know that Melanie Dineen and the Board of Health has an email list for every common victualer license in the city of Medford and she has reached out to them on several occasions and she has asked anybody who wants to do outdoor seating to register with the city.

621
00:40:53,435 --> 00:40:55,536
We've given them a URL that's new.

622
00:40:56,096 --> 00:41:00,622
to do a registration form so that we can then check everything with them.

623
00:41:01,122 --> 00:41:07,490
And the only business from Stations Landing that we've heard from is Long Cross.

624
00:41:08,191 --> 00:41:08,391
Right.

625
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:14,278
I think every other liquor license holder in Station Landing has outdoor dining already.

626
00:41:15,405 --> 00:41:17,266
Every one of those has it.

627
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,747
And I believe Long Cross has it too.

628
00:41:19,907 --> 00:41:20,967
I don't have the files though.

629
00:41:21,407 --> 00:41:25,409
I don't believe there's a restaurant in Station Landing of any size.

630
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:32,471
I mean, Five Guys doesn't even have a liquor license, but anybody with a liquor license in Station Landing has outdoor dining.

631
00:41:32,871 --> 00:41:44,015
It's the ones, I think Alicia's talking about ones that are on public streets that need the ability of picking up that square footage from the public street to give those restaurants access to the sidewalks.

632
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:44,733
Right.

633
00:41:44,873 --> 00:41:50,858
And we there are a few that we think believe they can just start operating.

634
00:41:51,438 --> 00:42:00,345
And we've the Board of Health and the building departments are John Bavuso and Melanie have started now that we've dealt with the people who came to us mass.

635
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:02,707
Now they're going through the ones who we think

636
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:14,774
may be operating because they believe they can just operate and checking to make sure that they have adequate space between their tables and that they're following the COVID-19 guidelines.

637
00:42:15,314 --> 00:42:23,919
A few of them may be told that they have to move some outdoor tables in order to allow, because no restaurant allows six feet between tables normally.

638
00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:25,260
That's huge.

639
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:30,543
So now John and Melanie are starting to check in on those restaurants.

640
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:37,912
They shouldn't need to come to you because if anything, we're asking them to reduce their seating, not expand it.

641
00:42:37,992 --> 00:42:41,774
And we have to do that, but we have to follow the guidelines.

642
00:42:41,974 --> 00:42:42,435
That's right.

643
00:42:43,615 --> 00:42:44,156
That's right.

644
00:42:44,376 --> 00:42:44,836
Interesting.

645
00:42:45,717 --> 00:43:00,028
But if any of those, that's probably, I mean, the idea of blocking off parking to allow additional tables, while it's something that could never have been conceived of before in Medford for some businesses, it's preferable.

646
00:43:00,448 --> 00:43:04,331
They'd rather have a customer who has to walk two or three blocks than no customer.

647
00:43:05,112 --> 00:43:05,372
Correct.

648
00:43:05,612 --> 00:43:07,494
We're having those conversations now.

649
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:12,758
And that's why during these times, I think the city, it has been,

650
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:22,015
but needs to continue to be very proactive to get these restaurants, give them a chance of making it and give them whatever they need to open in my mind.

651
00:43:22,675 --> 00:43:30,698
And that's the reason this commission will be very open and favorable to trying to do whatever we can to make it happen for them.

652
00:43:31,718 --> 00:43:35,020
We will not be the stumbling block, so to speak.

653
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,920
My pleasure.

654
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:39,822
Let's see.

655
00:43:42,974 --> 00:43:44,715
I don't have anything else on my agenda.

656
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,476
Anybody else have anything they'd like to bring up?

657
00:43:49,138 --> 00:43:50,219
No, I'm good.

658
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:51,459
Daria?

659
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,060
That's it, I believe.

660
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:53,981
Okay.

661
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:54,982
Dominic?

662
00:43:56,122 --> 00:43:56,502
I'm good.

663
00:43:57,023 --> 00:44:02,746
The chamber, I listen, I'm speaking, I'm sure for everybody and the board of directors and the president and so on.

664
00:44:03,187 --> 00:44:03,567
Thank you.

665
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:05,428
Thank you for what you just said, Jimmy.

666
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:12,680
And Alan and Daria, you know, people always say, oh God, we got to go before the liquor commission.

667
00:44:13,381 --> 00:44:27,372
Listen, they don't know sometimes how wonderful you guys are, you know, and how empathetic and how willing you are to cooperate and make things happen for people that are, especially now, that are just losing their shirts and so on.

668
00:44:27,412 --> 00:44:31,695
So to everybody that ever asks me those questions and they call me day in and day out.

669
00:44:32,476 --> 00:44:33,836
And the others say, no, no, no, no.

670
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:39,778
If there's anything that they can do, unless it's illegal, it's only illegal, they are going to go out of their way to make it happen.

671
00:44:40,098 --> 00:44:50,361
And this today, the Zoom proves that anybody that got on the Zoom, they will know that and hopefully pass a word along that you are extremely reasonable, you know, and in respect of the law, obviously.

672
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:57,183
So thank you, thank you to all of you on behalf of me personally, of course, and the Chamber of Commerce and everybody else involved in these restaurants that

673
00:44:57,603 --> 00:45:03,185
You know, we've done everything we can to try to make them stay open, as you know, with the money we raise and the money and the gifts and things and so on.

674
00:45:03,225 --> 00:45:04,326
And you guys are doing your part.

675
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:06,907
So all the love in my heart for all of you.

676
00:45:07,427 --> 00:45:08,988
Thank you for those very kind words.

677
00:45:09,048 --> 00:45:09,288
Yeah.

678
00:45:09,468 --> 00:45:10,909
And thank you, Alicia, for your input.

679
00:45:10,929 --> 00:45:12,249
Alicia, absolutely.

680
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:13,530
All you guys at City Hall.

681
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,250
You're more than welcome at any one of our meetings.

682
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,151
And the mayor, all of you.

683
00:45:16,251 --> 00:45:16,551
All of you.

684
00:45:16,571 --> 00:45:16,951
Thank you.

685
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:17,551
Yeah.

686
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:18,031
Thank you.

687
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:19,212
And there's John.

688
00:45:19,232 --> 00:45:21,553
That's John.

689
00:45:21,693 --> 00:45:22,373
Thank you, John.

690
00:45:24,274 --> 00:45:24,874
You're on mute.

691
00:45:25,435 --> 00:45:25,875
Oh, there you are.

692
00:45:26,195 --> 00:45:26,515
There you go.

693
00:45:27,948 --> 00:45:28,968
I don't know.

694
00:45:28,988 --> 00:45:30,469
No, he's still on mute.

695
00:45:30,509 --> 00:45:31,149
Sorry, John.

696
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:32,870
It's a good way to do it, Alicia.

697
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:37,711
Thank you.

698
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:44,593
The only question that I had is, none of this has to be sent to ABCC, right?

699
00:45:44,613 --> 00:45:44,973
Do you mind?

700
00:45:45,053 --> 00:45:45,614
It does not.

701
00:45:46,254 --> 00:45:49,215
No, we have the authority to do this on our own.

702
00:45:50,275 --> 00:45:56,297
You just need to make a record diary of what the representation was for the alteration of premises.

703
00:45:57,583 --> 00:46:05,746
Um, put it in their file and, um, you need to, um, also, uh, just make a note, um, of the expiration date.

704
00:46:06,126 --> 00:46:06,566
Yeah.

705
00:46:06,626 --> 00:46:07,426
November 20th.

706
00:46:07,946 --> 00:46:09,287
Yeah.

707
00:46:09,327 --> 00:46:10,067
November 20th.

708
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:10,247
Yeah.

709
00:46:11,047 --> 00:46:11,427
That's right.

710
00:46:11,527 --> 00:46:13,108
So it's November 20th, 2020.

711
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,609
I don't know if there's a specific date.

712
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:17,849
I thought it was the end of November or maybe it's November 1st.

713
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:19,450
We thought it was November 1st, 2020.

714
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:19,670
Ah, okay.

715
00:46:23,734 --> 00:46:25,075
So November 1st, 2020.

716
00:46:25,595 --> 00:46:25,816
All right.

717
00:46:25,856 --> 00:46:26,556
That's my bad.

718
00:46:26,596 --> 00:46:27,997
I thought it was November 20th, 2020.

719
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:30,920
That's why I had all these twenties in my head.

720
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:31,560
Okay.

721
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,743
In this part of the country, it's probably not going to last beyond November 1st anyways with the weather.

722
00:46:36,244 --> 00:46:36,384
Yeah.

723
00:46:36,404 --> 00:46:36,984
That's my guess.

724
00:46:37,284 --> 00:46:37,805
That's true.

725
00:46:38,085 --> 00:46:38,826
That's true.

726
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:40,807
Yeah.

727
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:41,147
All right.

728
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:43,249
A motion to adjourn that I guess would be in line.

729
00:46:43,729 --> 00:46:44,590
Yeah.

730
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,651
A motion to adjourn.

731
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:47,112
Thank you very much, everyone.

732
00:46:47,686 --> 00:46:48,509
Javier, great.

733
00:46:49,031 --> 00:46:50,235
Alicia, thank you so much.

734
00:46:50,777 --> 00:46:53,025
The chamber, Ben, thank you very much.

735
00:46:55,172 --> 00:46:56,597
Thank you for doing it again next week.

736
00:46:56,617 --> 00:46:56,999
Thank you.

737
00:46:57,019 --> 00:46:57,179
Yes.
