00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:14,749
[SPEAKER_09]: So moving right ahead, first thing on our agenda is to approve the minutes from the May 20th, 2020 meeting, which have been distributed.

00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:28,455
[SPEAKER_14]: But nevertheless, thank you, Daria, for doing that.

104
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:36,001
[SPEAKER_14]: The minutes are concise and accurate, and I motion to approve the minutes as they were written.

00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:38,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I second that.

106
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:39,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

107
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:47,030
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I don't know if you guys saw that Kent Cross doesn't have a working mic.

108
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,471
[SPEAKER_10]: He's just an interested citizen.

109
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:53,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine with me, it's okay.

110
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:53,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

111
00:05:54,486 --> 00:05:57,609
[SPEAKER_09]: The minutes have been motioned and seconded.

112
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:59,510
[SPEAKER_09]: So those minutes have been approved.

113
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:10,439
[SPEAKER_09]: First item on my agenda is the representative from Long Cross, Byron Kitchen at 501 Felsway for an alteration of premises.

114
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:12,641
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anybody?

115
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:16,524
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, that's the list I got.

116
00:06:17,821 --> 00:06:24,243
[SPEAKER_10]: I went by the list that I got from Alicia, two days ago before doing that john, when I did agenda.

117
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:28,824
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think, Alicia, they're not.

118
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:32,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they do you know if they have outside premises.

119
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:37,446
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there was some confusion between that outside premises.

120
00:06:40,228 --> 00:06:47,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do not have a list of whether or not they have an outdoor liquor license yet.

121
00:06:47,737 --> 00:06:47,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

122
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,481
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

123
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:52,643
[SPEAKER_09]: So they did not file an application then Daria?

124
00:06:53,104 --> 00:06:53,785
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they did not.

125
00:06:53,805 --> 00:06:54,926
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

126
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:59,031
[SPEAKER_09]: So next one on my agenda is the Porch Southern Fair in Duke.

127
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:00,479
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't either.

128
00:07:00,499 --> 00:07:01,679
[SPEAKER_10]: They do not either.

129
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Alicia sent it to me, but they didn't file it.

130
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:05,742
[SPEAKER_10]: They didn't file?

131
00:07:06,183 --> 00:07:10,386
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on the list from the clerk's office.

132
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:21,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are several where we believe the health department, building department, think that they've already had for many years outdoor dining and liquor license.

133
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:34,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the the porch Bertucci Razzos semolina and snappy patties But we haven't had access to an elect like a list anyway, right?

134
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:47,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah And then I remember when we approved long cross their plans showed outside dining to remember all along the back end of the restaurant, so Yeah

135
00:07:50,457 --> 00:08:01,727
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought maybe they did because they came in to the place that was not your average Joe's, but we have not been able to get anybody to confirm that for us.

136
00:08:01,827 --> 00:08:04,830
[SPEAKER_01]: And they told us they had a liquor license, but I'd like that.

137
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:05,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

138
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:07,192
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, I get it.

139
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:11,035
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

140
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:15,279
[SPEAKER_09]: So the next one I have on my agenda that is real gusto.

141
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:16,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

142
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:19,456
[SPEAKER_10]: I have them as well.

143
00:08:19,856 --> 00:08:22,378
[SPEAKER_09]: They have their application and they are present?

144
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

145
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:31,365
[SPEAKER_09]: If they could explain their alteration, that would be very much appreciated.

146
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:42,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, we have a back alley, and we got the authorization from the landlord to use it.

147
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:48,284
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have two small balconies that I think, in the end, are inside.

148
00:08:48,524 --> 00:08:54,685
[SPEAKER_08]: But we are asking for the, let's say, the patio we would like to put outside.

149
00:08:55,205 --> 00:09:05,292
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing is that now the health department, they didn't get us the approval for the COVID-19.

150
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:13,218
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's happening is that we are asking for this license in order to open after this.

151
00:09:13,258 --> 00:09:19,803
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like something more hopefully for the near future.

152
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:23,666
[SPEAKER_08]: But now we are just opening two balconies in the restaurant.

153
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:26,922
[SPEAKER_09]: two balconies off the restaurant?

154
00:09:27,263 --> 00:09:27,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

155
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:29,643
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this to the rear overlooking the river?

156
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:30,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

157
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,404
[SPEAKER_09]: And how many tables can you put on those two balconies?

158
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:38,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Just two tables for, let's say six, two tables for three.

159
00:09:39,906 --> 00:09:40,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Two tables for three.

160
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:42,367
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

161
00:09:43,547 --> 00:09:48,568
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're not looking to expand to any other spot, the sidewalk out front or anything else?

162
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,049
[SPEAKER_09]: You just want two balconies

163
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry, not in the front.

164
00:09:53,191 --> 00:10:00,074
[SPEAKER_08]: We think it's not a nice place to put tables in the front of 24th High Street.

165
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:11,298
[SPEAKER_08]: We are thinking after the COVID-19 to open in the back alley, that is 20th High Street, and I think we already sent all the documentation.

166
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:13,019
[SPEAKER_08]: about these seats.

167
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:21,285
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing is that we don't have the nine feet that are requested for the COVID-19 issue.

168
00:10:21,866 --> 00:10:39,800
[SPEAKER_08]: So yesterday we talked to Melanie and to John and they suggested us to ask for this license for the future, also for these spots and in that spots we are going to have five tables, so ten seats.

169
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:45,939
[SPEAKER_09]: But all you're looking for today is, my question for you is, how do you access the balcony?

170
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Where you're gonna have two... I mean, there's two big windows.

171
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:55,107
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like an open room.

172
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:58,250
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that, but I've actually eaten at your restaurant several times.

173
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:02,374
[SPEAKER_09]: But to get to the balcony, you gotta walk through the restaurant, correct?

174
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:03,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, correct.

175
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:08,059
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's what... That is allowed by the health department.

176
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:08,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

177
00:11:09,523 --> 00:11:16,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, it is allowed by the health department, but that is not necessarily the intent of what the governor wanted.

178
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:19,030
[SPEAKER_09]: The governor asked for open dining.

179
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:26,276
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are trans transitioning from the restaurant to get to a balcony for six people, is that what you're saying?

180
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:27,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

181
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:30,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, that sort of is not

182
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,941
[SPEAKER_09]: the intent of what the spirit is of this.

183
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:41,584
[SPEAKER_09]: So how do you prevent people from stopping and sitting down while they're waiting to sit for the six tables out back, six seats?

184
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:46,626
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no seats available on the dining room or at the bar.

185
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,346
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like a book.

186
00:11:48,366 --> 00:11:49,487
[SPEAKER_09]: You've taken all those away.

187
00:11:49,927 --> 00:11:55,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, I'm taking all the seats on the tables and everything is not accessible for other people to sit.

188
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:58,909
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a long way.

189
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,131
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a long walk to reach the balconies.

190
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:08,632
[SPEAKER_09]: For six parties, I mean, a table of three and three, six people.

191
00:12:08,672 --> 00:12:11,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, six people that are very far from each other.

192
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:12,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so.

193
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:15,556
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is enough room.

194
00:12:15,656 --> 00:12:19,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yesterday, we had the meeting with Melanie from the Bordeaux Health.

195
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:22,741
[SPEAKER_08]: They were more than comfortable about this thing.

196
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:23,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

197
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they can be comfortable with it.

198
00:12:24,982 --> 00:12:25,983
[SPEAKER_09]: They're dealing with the food.

199
00:12:26,363 --> 00:12:27,304
[SPEAKER_09]: We're dealing with the liquor.

200
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

201
00:12:29,185 --> 00:12:33,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the barcodes are closed.

202
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:37,711
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is no way that people can get out without, I mean, noise.

203
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:42,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, closed balconies.

204
00:12:43,985 --> 00:12:46,246
[SPEAKER_08]: overlooking the river.

205
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:48,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Ben, you had a question?

206
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:51,909
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just the two tables that you'll be able to get open?

207
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:52,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

208
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, just two.

209
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,111
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's something.

210
00:12:55,171 --> 00:13:02,514
[SPEAKER_08]: In this time, also two tables is something compared to nothing.

211
00:13:02,594 --> 00:13:05,336
[SPEAKER_05]: This is kind of a question to maybe the commissioners, but does the

212
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:19,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Governor make a rule I mean does, like do they include open, maybe we'll get to this with some of the doors, where you know, maybe wants to mute it.

213
00:13:19,783 --> 00:13:24,507
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, open doors count is outside.

214
00:13:25,808 --> 00:13:28,631
[SPEAKER_08]: It's outside, the two balconies are outside of the premises.

215
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's outside.

216
00:13:30,092 --> 00:13:31,033
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's outside.

217
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:33,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I thought it was just open doors.

218
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:36,457
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, it's just you go outside.

219
00:13:36,998 --> 00:13:48,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but Jim, to your point, I understand it's almost like it's a loose interpretation because you're cutting through the restaurant to get outside versus approaching the restaurant and you're already outside, but

220
00:13:49,729 --> 00:14:00,556
[SPEAKER_14]: But I believe if he's taken the steps to remove tables and chairs to keep people from loitering and sitting down, then, you know, I'm comfortable with that.

221
00:14:03,098 --> 00:14:06,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, if the Board of Health has looked at it,

222
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:17,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I know it's kind of turning the rule or the guideline or the law inside out, but I don't see a problem with that.

223
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:25,741
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wish we had, a long time ago, developed a river and developed like a boardwalk along the back so we'd be able to access it from the back.

224
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,643
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's another point.

225
00:14:28,924 --> 00:14:33,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for sure we are doing everything to make it happen.

226
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:36,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

227
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:53,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I guess for two tables and, you know, for the liquor service, I don't see that, you know, I don't, I don't have a problem with it.

228
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,481
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me just add one other thing.

229
00:14:55,561 --> 00:15:08,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody realizes that any license that's being entertained today will expire at the earlier of November, 2020 or at the governor's, um, reversal of his order.

230
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:16,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and also, um, if there are any violations relative to the liquor licensing.

231
00:15:17,197 --> 00:15:31,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Authority today, everybody agrees without any hearing, um, at, at the, um, suggestion of the alcoholic beverage control commission.

232
00:15:34,005 --> 00:15:34,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody understand?

233
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:34,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

234
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:35,805
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

235
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:52,735
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, as long as, uh, real gusto understands if there's people sitting inside that restaurant waiting for a table that, in my opinion, is a violation of the governor's order for open seating.

236
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,338
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you do qualify for the open seating out back.

237
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:01,543
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, I think you are entitled to have people sitting out there.

238
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:08,530
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think sitting any other place, regardless of what the Board of Health has to say, is a potential violation.

239
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Understood.

240
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:18,932
[SPEAKER_08]: We are doing just, in order to avoid anyone waiting, we are working just on reservation only.

241
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:19,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I got it.

242
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:20,752
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes sense.

243
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,033
[SPEAKER_08]: So like three shifts, 4 p.m., 6 p.m., 8 p.m.

244
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:28,614
[SPEAKER_08]: So people never, I think, get each other.

245
00:16:28,634 --> 00:16:29,054
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fine.

246
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:30,675
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're doing the right thing.

247
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:31,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim?

248
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:32,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

249
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:35,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Jim, hi.

250
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:40,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, for optics, for the sake of optics, I understand your position exactly, and I don't blame you for bringing that out.

251
00:16:42,054 --> 00:16:54,724
[SPEAKER_13]: What if Mateo were to put, you know, those nice little things that look like you create with little sticks and with a tape or something that would make it look like a car or that you can't possibly, you know, go left or right of it directly to that.

252
00:16:55,084 --> 00:16:59,287
[SPEAKER_13]: If he were to do that, at least... I think that's a good suggestion.

253
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:01,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a good suggestion, Dominic.

254
00:17:02,086 --> 00:17:10,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just trying to protect the license holders in the city so we don't issue a license and then have a misunderstanding down the road.

255
00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:13,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be disastrous for what the intent is here.

256
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:21,134
[SPEAKER_09]: The intent is to try to give these restaurants a leg up so they can get up and operating and opening without waiting for the next phase to open.

257
00:17:21,154 --> 00:17:25,195
[SPEAKER_09]: So anything like that, I think, would be very helpful in the whole process.

258
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:25,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

259
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:28,156
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the objects are important.

260
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:28,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

261
00:17:29,177 --> 00:17:29,317
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

262
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:31,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

263
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:32,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

264
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

265
00:17:33,096 --> 00:17:33,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further questions?

266
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:36,037
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm good.

267
00:17:36,157 --> 00:17:36,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

268
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:37,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

269
00:17:37,378 --> 00:17:40,779
[SPEAKER_14]: So, uh, I motion to accept the, uh, alteration of premises.

270
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

271
00:17:45,341 --> 00:17:50,483
[SPEAKER_09]: License is granted for the alteration of premises.

272
00:17:52,564 --> 00:17:55,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, the next item I have on my agenda is snappy patties.

273
00:17:57,406 --> 00:18:01,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously, um, you know, this is all subject to the board of health as Alicia said,

274
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:05,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, and, uh, I assume you're working your way through that.

275
00:18:06,414 --> 00:18:08,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, next one I have on my agenda is snappy patties.

276
00:18:11,076 --> 00:18:27,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Snappy patties has informed us that they are intending to use their existing outdoor dining area, which we understand already has an outdoor dining alcohol license permit, and they're not going to expand any further beyond their existing footprint.

277
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:28,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Fine.

278
00:18:28,622 --> 00:18:29,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

279
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:30,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

280
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:36,026
[SPEAKER_09]: So now we will take on a, I guess, a first come first serve basis.

281
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:40,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other pending applicants in no particular order?

282
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:45,936
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my audio to work.

283
00:18:45,976 --> 00:18:48,278
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can hear me, have the floor, Denise.

284
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:53,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

285
00:18:53,358 --> 00:19:05,703
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put in an application for outdoor seating out back behind the restaurant, take advantage of four of the parking spots that parallel the back of the building.

286
00:19:08,465 --> 00:19:18,929
[SPEAKER_00]: But for ADA compliance, I will need to have a couple out front because that's the only access that anybody who's mobility challenge can get into the restaurant.

287
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:27,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, have you- I'm sorry, Denise, how many, four spots out back, two spots in front?

288
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:38,343
[SPEAKER_00]: No, four of the parking spots, Alan, but I was hoping to use the sidewalk out front because the sidewalk is nine feet in diameter.

289
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:39,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

290
00:19:39,183 --> 00:19:44,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And my tables are about two feet wide, so that does give about seven feet clearance.

291
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:48,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and how many individuals?

292
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So a total front and back, Alan?

293
00:19:53,813 --> 00:19:55,374
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

294
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:59,257
[SPEAKER_00]: So total front and back, if I do my math correctly, about 25.

295
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,939
[SPEAKER_00]: And that still gives us six feet apart.

296
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

297
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Denise, could you just walk me through the four parking spaces?

298
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:08,743
[SPEAKER_09]: How many tables go up there?

299
00:20:08,763 --> 00:20:10,404
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I wanted to know.

300
00:20:10,604 --> 00:20:12,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I did the math.

301
00:20:12,525 --> 00:20:17,709
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I squeeze, if I do six feet apart, because the tables that I have are about,

302
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:24,464
[SPEAKER_00]: not more than any two feet in diameter and the stools are pretty small too.

303
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:44,212
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I go along the four spots, I could do, like I could get four into one spot, then, I'm sorry, eight into one, two in the next, eight into one, two in the next by spreading them six feet apart.

304
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:45,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

305
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:47,814
[SPEAKER_09]: And how many out front?

306
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:52,458
[SPEAKER_00]: I could fit five if I needed to, but that would be the max.

307
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:55,322
[SPEAKER_09]: Six feet apart and get five.

308
00:20:55,562 --> 00:20:55,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

309
00:20:56,544 --> 00:20:57,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me ask another question.

310
00:20:57,505 --> 00:21:00,849
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you got permission from the city for the parking lot and the sidewalk?

311
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:02,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

312
00:21:03,643 --> 00:21:04,643
[SPEAKER_01]: Denise, if I might.

313
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:12,406
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are working through that process and advise Denise to talk to you in a parallel process.

314
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:16,667
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working with Todd Blake, our traffic planner, to lay it out.

315
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:20,288
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're getting ready to take it to the traffic commission.

316
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:25,229
[SPEAKER_01]: But we advise her to speak with you at the same time that we're going to.

317
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that makes a lot of sense, Alicia.

318
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:35,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Because whatever decision we make here, Denise, would be subject to whatever the city passes judgment on the parking lot and the sidewalk.

319
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:37,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.

320
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:39,293
[SPEAKER_09]: So just along those lines.

321
00:21:44,494 --> 00:21:55,776
[SPEAKER_09]: So alcohol that would be delivered to the parking lot would be delivered from your bar area up the back staircase to the parking lot.

322
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:02,310
[SPEAKER_09]: And what steps would you take to make sure that alcohol doesn't leave the four parking spots?

323
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:06,431
[SPEAKER_00]: The same steps that I would is for inside.

324
00:22:07,412 --> 00:22:12,514
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be training with my staff and I would have two managers on every shift.

325
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:15,435
[SPEAKER_00]: So one could monitor out back and one could monitor out front.

326
00:22:17,815 --> 00:22:18,756
[SPEAKER_09]: And the same is true.

327
00:22:19,516 --> 00:22:21,797
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you have somebody out back at all times?

328
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:26,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, unless I get, you know, one of us get called in, but that's the idea.

329
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:30,635
[SPEAKER_09]: So one all back and one out front, potentially.

330
00:22:31,776 --> 00:22:32,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

331
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:34,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you put any questions out, Ben?

332
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:35,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

333
00:22:35,358 --> 00:22:40,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was wondering, Denise, do you put partitions like, or something like that, or?

334
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:52,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so what I had done is, in a call, speaking to Alicia and a few other people, I had asked if the city could loan me some saw horses.

335
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:56,725
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of section the parking spots off.

336
00:22:58,226 --> 00:23:02,587
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was also looking into like a freestanding tent area.

337
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:09,509
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe as we go along, maybe some kind of even fencing or something.

338
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,751
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm glad you brought up the tent, Denise.

339
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:20,573
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that the ABCC, I've been in contact with them, as you might imagine, almost every day this week.

340
00:23:21,654 --> 00:23:22,714
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do have a tent,

341
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:26,859
[SPEAKER_09]: you are not allowed to have more than two sides on the tent.

342
00:23:28,019 --> 00:23:30,960
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones I was thinking of have no sides at all.

343
00:23:31,341 --> 00:23:35,502
[SPEAKER_09]: In their opinion, if you have four sides and we're bound to have rain at some point, right?

344
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:39,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it becomes a closed dining experience, which is not allowed.

345
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:43,605
[SPEAKER_09]: So just keep that in the back of your mind if you decide to put up a tent.

346
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Allen, Brian, Ben, any?

347
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:52,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, I get it.

348
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:59,925
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy you're talking about fencing because that was one of our concerns with Snappy Patty when they were talking about moving out back.

349
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:04,867
[SPEAKER_14]: We were concerned that someone might hit the gas pedal rather than the brake.

350
00:24:04,887 --> 00:24:09,549
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm glad you are taking steps for that area.

351
00:24:09,829 --> 00:24:11,149
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm fine.

352
00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:12,710
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have any other questions.

353
00:24:13,275 --> 00:24:17,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm kind of lucky because my brother happens to be in the fence business.

354
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:21,320
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, get him over there.

355
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that doesn't hurt, Denise.

356
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:25,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Right?

357
00:24:26,863 --> 00:24:27,323
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

358
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:28,664
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, that's all good.

359
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:31,665
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't have any other questions.

360
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:32,906
[SPEAKER_09]: No other questions, Ben?

361
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:34,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Alan, no other questions?

362
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:42,291
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I think it's smart and it's a good solution to the nightmare that we're all trying to get through.

363
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:42,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

364
00:24:43,485 --> 00:24:44,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Mark.

365
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:44,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

366
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:45,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

367
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:46,946
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion would be in order.

368
00:24:46,966 --> 00:24:48,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, again, yeah.

369
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:53,787
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd, I'd motion, uh, for alter premises, uh, for Salvatore's restaurant.

370
00:24:54,487 --> 00:24:54,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

371
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:56,808
[SPEAKER_05]: I would second the motion.

372
00:24:57,348 --> 00:24:58,188
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

373
00:24:58,588 --> 00:25:08,730
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, subject to the city of Medford's confirmation, Denise and, and all of the other things that I said, it expires November of 2020, unless extended by the governor.

374
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,590
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, so that's fine.

375
00:25:10,651 --> 00:25:12,971
[SPEAKER_09]: So the alteration has been approved.

376
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:13,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

377
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:15,011
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

378
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:16,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck.

379
00:25:16,452 --> 00:25:16,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

380
00:25:16,852 --> 00:25:17,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck.

381
00:25:18,013 --> 00:25:18,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

382
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:21,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Next morning, Carol.

383
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:25,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Good afternoon, Mari.

384
00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:26,539
[SPEAKER_09]: Good.

385
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:26,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

386
00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:31,202
[SPEAKER_09]: So just give us a little background of where you are.

387
00:25:31,683 --> 00:25:37,287
[SPEAKER_11]: We have applied for the outside service of alcohol service.

388
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:38,627
[SPEAKER_11]: It's,

389
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:47,864
[SPEAKER_11]: It is our plan to use the sidewalk in front of the restaurant, going towards the crowded bridge.

390
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:52,845
[SPEAKER_11]: We're waiting for DCR to give us approval.

391
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:59,886
[SPEAKER_11]: They're supposed to, their legal department is far as coming out with approval for using the bridge.

392
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:08,928
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess it's a blanket liability thing that they're doing for this circumstance throughout the state for all their property.

393
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,371
[SPEAKER_09]: How far over the bridge would you like to go, Murray?

394
00:26:12,891 --> 00:26:15,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably just about halfway up to the first pillar.

395
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:18,913
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want to get too overextended there.

396
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:27,756
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got to be one of those situations where, you know, we have to set it up in the afternoon and break it down when we're done at night time, bring everything in.

397
00:26:27,856 --> 00:26:30,897
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, we're just trying to take a little bit of the curse off.

398
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:31,757
[SPEAKER_09]: I get it.

399
00:26:32,337 --> 00:26:34,738
[SPEAKER_09]: How many tables would you like to get, Murray?

400
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:42,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're somewhere, we measured it without actually putting tables out there and that always changes.

401
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,662
[SPEAKER_11]: The area seems to shrink when you get the tables out there.

402
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:49,365
[SPEAKER_11]: But my guess is we're somewhere around 15 two-tops.

403
00:26:51,607 --> 00:26:53,628
[SPEAKER_09]: When you say two-tops, two person per table?

404
00:26:53,728 --> 00:26:55,449
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, 15 deuces.

405
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,133
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to put them right up against the building and against the railing on the bridge.

406
00:27:00,694 --> 00:27:04,358
[SPEAKER_11]: If we have to bring one in for a party of four, we'll be pulling there.

407
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:11,826
[SPEAKER_11]: But judging with the six foot clearance that we need to create between tables, I'm thinking somewhere around 15.

408
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:21,155
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mari, as you look at your front door, except for the window to the right of your front door, is it predominantly seating going to the left as you look at your front door?

409
00:27:23,196 --> 00:27:23,516
[SPEAKER_09]: It is.

410
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:26,399
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have, we'll have our managers will be out there.

411
00:27:26,459 --> 00:27:28,741
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll be greeting the guests, seating them.

412
00:27:29,421 --> 00:27:31,343
[SPEAKER_11]: There's obviously no waiting area.

413
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:32,644
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be taking phone numbers.

414
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:35,387
[SPEAKER_11]: If there is a wait, they'll have to wait in their car.

415
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:40,171
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll text them or call them to let them know that there is a table available.

416
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:48,178
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to kind of go with the 90 minute rule that everyone seems to be existing on as far as table occupancy.

417
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:50,560
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can kind of do a little bit of a turn.

418
00:27:51,396 --> 00:27:59,892
[SPEAKER_11]: We've come out with a more limited menu that's more conducive to outdoor dining than our regular heavy menu that we serve inside.

419
00:28:01,194 --> 00:28:03,478
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not going to move any tables towards high street.

420
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:05,617
[SPEAKER_09]: they're all gonna go straight.

421
00:28:05,737 --> 00:28:06,698
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we're going the other way.

422
00:28:06,738 --> 00:28:07,518
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going the other way.

423
00:28:07,618 --> 00:28:11,719
[SPEAKER_14]: Too much congestion down there.

424
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:25,482
[SPEAKER_14]: Maury, you said the first pillar, I can't, there's scaffolding set up by my bank, so I can't look out the window and look at the bridge, but the first pillar, is that a quarter of the way onto the bridge or halfway onto the bridge?

425
00:28:26,062 --> 00:28:27,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, I can't see it.

426
00:28:27,843 --> 00:28:29,423
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's around a third of the way, Alan.

427
00:28:30,088 --> 00:28:31,068
[SPEAKER_14]: A third, okay.

428
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:33,429
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're right deficit right in that window.

429
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:34,430
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not exactly sure.

430
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:53,077
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so you can't get halfway out to the bridge that's too ambitious or no way or I don't think at this point we want to go that far and stretch us out this that far, you know, we're still limited on staff and what we can do and, you know, if need be that we have to go halfway with certainly, you know,

431
00:28:55,054 --> 00:28:57,796
[SPEAKER_11]: take a look at it.

432
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:06,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Not for me to tell you your own business, but could you go for half of it and if you don't use it, at least you got that in your back pocket in case everything takes off?

433
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:11,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, absolutely.

434
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:11,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

435
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:13,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Dominic's got a question.

436
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:14,770
[SPEAKER_13]: through the chair.

437
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,454
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen, I can't wait for this to happen because to me, and I can't wait to go out.

438
00:29:18,474 --> 00:29:24,441
[SPEAKER_13]: I've done it because I, you know, I wasn't going to go to a restaurant, but it's going to seem as though I'm sitting in the Ponte Vecchio in Florence.

439
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:27,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Once he sets up, I think that's going to be great for Matt.

440
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:28,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my goodness.

441
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:29,466
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't wait.

442
00:29:29,987 --> 00:29:31,869
[SPEAKER_09]: All you need is the gondola is going underneath.

443
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:41,497
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can get Roland to move some of his jewelry over there, then we got the Ponte Vecchio.

444
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:42,198
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

445
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:42,678
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

446
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:43,239
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right.

447
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:45,903
[SPEAKER_13]: All those jewelry stores up and down the Ponte Vecchio, right?

448
00:29:45,963 --> 00:29:46,364
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

449
00:29:47,646 --> 00:30:00,390
[SPEAKER_09]: As I said to Denise, Mari, I'm just concerned about the alcohol staying where it's served to, you know, in light of, and I hope it's tremendously successful as Dominic said.

450
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:14,514
[SPEAKER_11]: I plan to coordinate office, you know, we're coming out with planters in between, where the seating area is and our restricted area as far as serving, that will be the dividing line.

451
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,931
[SPEAKER_11]: We have enough staff and experienced staff.

452
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:21,573
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been doing this all week.

453
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,215
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've both done a good job.

454
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:26,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody on this Zoom call has done a good job at dispensing alcohol.

455
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:30,821
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just suggesting it's a new era and a new, just be aware, that's all.

456
00:30:31,481 --> 00:30:33,042
[SPEAKER_11]: I hear you exactly, Jimmy.

457
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,324
[SPEAKER_11]: I know exactly what you're saying and appreciate that.

458
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:36,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

459
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any other further questions, Alan or Ben?

460
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:41,109
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, I'm good.

461
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Ben, you want to make the motion or you want me to do it?

462
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, I'll make the motion.

463
00:30:47,153 --> 00:30:54,321
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, uh, alteration of, uh, premises, premises, changing premises.

464
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,022
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just make that motion.

465
00:30:57,544 --> 00:31:01,088
[SPEAKER_09]: I seconded all those in approval.

466
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:02,529
[SPEAKER_09]: None.

467
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,952
[SPEAKER_09]: Your application has been approved.

468
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:06,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

469
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:07,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

470
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:10,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, Maury, like same, same thing to Denise.

471
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:12,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Very creative, very smart.

472
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,999
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I applaud you for thinking outside the box.

473
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,001
[SPEAKER_11]: We do the best we can right now.

474
00:31:20,321 --> 00:31:21,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.

475
00:31:23,803 --> 00:31:24,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, thanks so much gentlemen.

476
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:25,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate all your help.

477
00:31:25,744 --> 00:31:26,344
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

478
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter, I think you're up.

479
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:31,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you hear me?

480
00:31:31,286 --> 00:31:31,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

481
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:32,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can't hear you.

482
00:31:33,412 --> 00:31:38,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Peter, if you could just tell us a little bit about, although I ride by it every day, so I pretty got a pretty good sense.

483
00:31:38,975 --> 00:31:42,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you tell everybody what's involved with the R application?

484
00:31:43,538 --> 00:31:49,021
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking for maybe eight tables, 16 chairs out there on private property.

485
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:51,083
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right in front of the restaurant.

486
00:31:51,663 --> 00:31:53,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

487
00:31:54,104 --> 00:31:56,386
[SPEAKER_09]: And Alicia, I think the Board of Health is involved in

488
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:58,956
[SPEAKER_09]: in each one of these applications.

489
00:31:59,016 --> 00:32:05,480
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so this, whoever's a parent today, I assume is not a surprise to the board of health.

490
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,282
[SPEAKER_01]: They visited all of these locations.

491
00:32:08,402 --> 00:32:09,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

492
00:32:09,943 --> 00:32:14,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Avalino's is private and, um, state property.

493
00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:17,968
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're aware that they're working with the state for permission.

494
00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:20,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're aware of Salvatore's requests.

495
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:24,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Harold's requests to the state as well.

496
00:32:24,893 --> 00:32:25,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

497
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:28,906
[SPEAKER_09]: So Peter, I know you said it a minute ago, but I didn't have my pen in my hand.

498
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:29,466
[SPEAKER_09]: How many seats?

499
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:32,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Eight tables, 16 seats.

500
00:32:33,426 --> 00:32:33,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

501
00:32:39,788 --> 00:32:43,368
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like you have, do you already have any outdoor seating there?

502
00:32:43,608 --> 00:32:49,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there is that we just, we, we put a couple of tables out yesterday to see how it would go, but that was it.

503
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:49,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

504
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:51,550
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we never had in the past.

505
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,130
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no.

506
00:32:52,897 --> 00:32:56,239
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just intimidating out there with the mystic gap being like a straight shot.

507
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,982
[SPEAKER_03]: It's intimidating for me to do outside seating out there.

508
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:05,346
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would have loved to brought in maybe Jersey barriers this time here to kind of like off a bit.

509
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:08,388
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody rolls up on there, that would be, you know, scary.

510
00:33:08,748 --> 00:33:12,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but before I did any of that, I just wanted to make sure I got proper permission.

511
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:14,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

512
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:16,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it is private property.

513
00:33:16,573 --> 00:33:18,955
[SPEAKER_09]: So that, you know, eliminates that discussion.

514
00:33:19,936 --> 00:33:21,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and, um,

515
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:29,022
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, the only thing, as I said to the others, Peter, is just watching the alcohol because it is out in the public area.

516
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:31,603
[SPEAKER_09]: But short of that, I don't have any other questions.

517
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:34,383
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest with you, we're not a big alcohol facility, as you know.

518
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:35,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

519
00:33:35,243 --> 00:33:36,243
[SPEAKER_13]: I know.

520
00:33:37,344 --> 00:33:38,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Peter, good luck.

521
00:33:38,864 --> 00:33:40,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Through the chair, Peter, good luck.

522
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:42,605
[SPEAKER_13]: And hello to the girls, all my fellow students.

523
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:44,705
[SPEAKER_13]: I wish you all the best luck.

524
00:33:44,765 --> 00:33:46,725
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know how all of you have suffered, Peter.

525
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:47,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

526
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:48,686
[SPEAKER_04]: We love you.

527
00:33:48,706 --> 00:33:49,686
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get through it.

528
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:51,914
[SPEAKER_04]: You will get through it.

529
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:53,515
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll all get through it together.

530
00:33:53,535 --> 00:33:54,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's right.

531
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:55,797
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're all trying to do here.

532
00:33:55,837 --> 00:34:00,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Chairman, this might be a good time, if you allow me to speak to Alicia and get back to her.

533
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:11,610
[SPEAKER_13]: Last week on the same Zoom about this reopening and so on and so forth, I, with all my heart, I had offered my patio on the Mystic River, as you all know, to possibly Denise and Mari.

534
00:34:12,011 --> 00:34:16,374
[SPEAKER_13]: And when Alicia contacted me, she said, Dominic can potentially send that.

535
00:34:17,315 --> 00:34:23,058
[SPEAKER_13]: I contacted my insurance company and my law firms and so on, and they wanted to have me committed to even thinking about it.

536
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:27,600
[SPEAKER_13]: He says, you have no idea.

537
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,600
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, come on.

538
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:31,321
[SPEAKER_13]: But they said, no, no, no, you can't even think about it.

539
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:32,362
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, but why?

540
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:33,462
[SPEAKER_13]: My hat's in the right place.

541
00:34:33,482 --> 00:34:34,843
[SPEAKER_13]: And so they gave me this list.

542
00:34:34,883 --> 00:34:36,123
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, OK, OK, I get it.

543
00:34:36,183 --> 00:34:36,563
[SPEAKER_13]: I get it.

544
00:34:36,603 --> 00:34:36,984
[SPEAKER_13]: I get it.

545
00:34:37,484 --> 00:34:39,205
[SPEAKER_13]: And unfortunately, so but who knows?

546
00:34:39,265 --> 00:34:40,485
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe someday, some day.

547
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:41,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe someday.

548
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:44,126
[SPEAKER_13]: I will make it available.

549
00:34:44,247 --> 00:34:48,188
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know we'll find a way but right now they said don't even think about it.

550
00:34:48,808 --> 00:34:53,589
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so sorry I shouldn't have said it but I you know I wanted to with all my heart I really did.

551
00:34:54,510 --> 00:35:02,052
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor's policy that has been published and actually based on advice from KP Law our lawyers is that we

552
00:35:03,472 --> 00:35:12,994
[SPEAKER_01]: that everybody be required to have the property adjacent to theirs, so they're not comfortable with somebody walking across the street.

553
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:22,336
[SPEAKER_01]: And then open to the public seating has its own issues because somebody has to take responsibility for cleaning the tables.

554
00:35:23,097 --> 00:35:24,677
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a good point, Alicia.

555
00:35:24,737 --> 00:35:27,878
[SPEAKER_13]: I said, oh my God, okay, okay, okay, I get it, I get it.

556
00:35:29,618 --> 00:35:31,218
[SPEAKER_13]: But like I said, my house was in the right place.

557
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:34,980
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think, Dominic?

558
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:40,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Dominic, you think Denise is going to come across the street with a plate of chicken piccata and bring it in the back?

559
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:41,066
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

560
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:44,809
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, I think maybe, maybe Colleen's or something.

561
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:48,993
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what the issue is, but I might have breaks, you know, but not being right.

562
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:49,553
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you can't.

563
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:50,834
[SPEAKER_13]: You're outside of that.

564
00:35:51,595 --> 00:35:56,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Pat, whatever, you can't even think about it, let alone making it available.

565
00:35:56,097 --> 00:35:57,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, all right, I get it, I get it now.

566
00:35:58,157 --> 00:35:59,638
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's a good point, Alicia.

567
00:35:59,678 --> 00:36:04,940
[SPEAKER_09]: The ABCC has also been very specific that it has to be contiguous.

568
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:13,843
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no walking across the street with tables, I'm sorry, pallets of beer or wine and crossing High Street.

569
00:36:14,643 --> 00:36:16,884
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't meet the test.

570
00:36:17,224 --> 00:36:18,625
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it makes sense, it makes sense.

571
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,982
[SPEAKER_13]: So Peter, I don't have any other questions.

572
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:25,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Chairman, can I share this pressure with my friends that I can still do that?

573
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,164
[SPEAKER_13]: God, I can.

574
00:36:26,224 --> 00:36:26,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you can.

575
00:36:27,705 --> 00:36:29,926
[SPEAKER_13]: What if I put a little sambuca, which is liquor?

576
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:32,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I do that?

577
00:36:32,887 --> 00:36:33,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

578
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:35,008
[SPEAKER_14]: No problem.

579
00:36:35,048 --> 00:36:36,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

580
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, Ben or Alan, any questions for Peter?

581
00:36:40,673 --> 00:36:42,174
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I don't have any questions for Peter.

582
00:36:42,194 --> 00:36:53,723
[SPEAKER_05]: No, and I think, I mean, actually, Peter, I think you have a lot of, you probably have the most space thus far out in front of your restaurant than, you know, compared, so I'm okay with it.

583
00:36:54,284 --> 00:37:01,329
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you'll take proper precautions and make a motion to approve the change.

584
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, seconded?

585
00:37:04,252 --> 00:37:05,032
[SPEAKER_14]: I second it, yeah.

586
00:37:05,573 --> 00:37:06,193
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

587
00:37:07,382 --> 00:37:07,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

588
00:37:08,122 --> 00:37:08,962
[SPEAKER_09]: That's approved, Peter.

589
00:37:09,402 --> 00:37:10,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Peter.

590
00:37:10,323 --> 00:37:11,183
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, everybody.

591
00:37:11,723 --> 00:37:12,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

592
00:37:12,723 --> 00:37:13,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

593
00:37:15,023 --> 00:37:35,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what we should do is, you know, given the fact that there is probably quite a few other people that probably want to come before us, the licensing commission for an alteration of premises, I think we should probably set up a weekly meeting until we satisfy the need.

594
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:45,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, so that everybody knows that we're meeting, uh, weekly until we get through this process to attempt to approve as many as possible and not tie anybody up.

595
00:37:46,536 --> 00:37:55,020
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I would like to make a motion that we, um, move, um, each week, Wednesday at one o'clock.

596
00:37:55,833 --> 00:38:06,795
[SPEAKER_09]: for at least the next, I don't know, let's say the next two weeks anyways, to see if we can't get everybody addressed before this, so we're not the log jam in the whole process.

597
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:11,897
[SPEAKER_09]: So starting next Wednesday, Daria, if you could set it up, Wednesday's at one o'clock.

598
00:38:12,337 --> 00:38:16,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we'll have a meeting next Wednesday anyways, like our regular meeting.

599
00:38:16,138 --> 00:38:17,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, yeah.

600
00:38:17,598 --> 00:38:22,339
[SPEAKER_09]: But then we'll do it for a couple of weeks after that too, or we'll vote next meeting.

601
00:38:23,283 --> 00:38:35,593
[SPEAKER_09]: But Alicia, if you could let everybody know in City Hall that we're doing that from the Board of Health and anybody else, I think it would be very helpful if everybody knows they can come in front of us on a Wednesday at one o'clock.

602
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:38,175
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it serves the community well.

603
00:38:39,702 --> 00:38:40,322
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

604
00:38:40,462 --> 00:38:53,067
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just ask Daria that if you do hear from people applying, it would be great to make sure you loop, just loop me in so that I can make sure that the board of health and the building department is also aware of their application.

605
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:57,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd hate to have somebody come to you and we don't realize it and we could have been looking.

606
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:02,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to keep it in sync enough.

607
00:39:03,815 --> 00:39:04,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's fine.

608
00:39:04,816 --> 00:39:05,717
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been working together.

609
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:12,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so we definitely have some places The best of my knowledge off the top of my head.

610
00:39:12,423 --> 00:39:28,158
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not restaurants that serve alcohol that traditionally put tables out in front and there's some concern that they may not have enough space because the guidelines at the Health Department and the building department are following or that you need a

611
00:39:28,818 --> 00:39:45,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Um six feet between the table and the walk aisle and then you need a three-foot walk aisle And so some of our sidewalks are wide enough So they're exploring some options that we are going to take to the traffic commission if the businesses are interested in

612
00:39:46,185 --> 00:39:53,772
[SPEAKER_01]: closing the park, the parallel parking in front of their businesses to allow the greater distance and to allow tables.

613
00:39:54,152 --> 00:39:58,496
[SPEAKER_01]: We're exploring that in some various locations to see if that's gonna be possible.

614
00:39:59,277 --> 00:40:03,781
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some restaurants that think that they can just put their tables out like usual.

615
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:08,685
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, under COVID restrictions, they don't legally have enough space.

616
00:40:09,345 --> 00:40:11,247
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Board of Health is following through with those.

617
00:40:11,307 --> 00:40:13,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the reasons why it's helpful

618
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:27,456
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you hear from anybody to just check like send that over to us immediately so we can check on it and let you know that we're looking at it too to avoid any misconceptions about whether or not they're going to be allowed to do it.

619
00:40:27,796 --> 00:40:32,618
[SPEAKER_14]: Are these our business partners down at uh station landing is that where some of the confusion is or

620
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:53,355
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't heard from any, so I just want you to know that Melanie Dineen and the Board of Health has an email list for every common victualer license in the city of Medford and she has reached out to them on several occasions and she has asked anybody who wants to do outdoor seating to register with the city.

621
00:40:53,435 --> 00:40:55,536
[SPEAKER_01]: We've given them a URL that's new.

622
00:40:56,096 --> 00:41:00,622
[SPEAKER_01]: to do a registration form so that we can then check everything with them.

623
00:41:01,122 --> 00:41:07,490
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only business from Stations Landing that we've heard from is Long Cross.

624
00:41:08,191 --> 00:41:08,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

625
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:14,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I think every other liquor license holder in Station Landing has outdoor dining already.

626
00:41:15,405 --> 00:41:17,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Every one of those has it.

627
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,747
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe Long Cross has it too.

628
00:41:19,907 --> 00:41:20,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have the files though.

629
00:41:21,407 --> 00:41:25,409
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe there's a restaurant in Station Landing of any size.

630
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:32,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Five Guys doesn't even have a liquor license, but anybody with a liquor license in Station Landing has outdoor dining.

631
00:41:32,871 --> 00:41:44,015
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the ones, I think Alicia's talking about ones that are on public streets that need the ability of picking up that square footage from the public street to give those restaurants access to the sidewalks.

632
00:41:44,493 --> 00:41:44,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

633
00:41:44,873 --> 00:41:50,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And we there are a few that we think believe they can just start operating.

634
00:41:51,438 --> 00:42:00,345
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've the Board of Health and the building departments are John Bavuso and Melanie have started now that we've dealt with the people who came to us mass.

635
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:02,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're going through the ones who we think

636
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:14,774
[SPEAKER_01]: may be operating because they believe they can just operate and checking to make sure that they have adequate space between their tables and that they're following the COVID-19 guidelines.

637
00:42:15,314 --> 00:42:23,919
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of them may be told that they have to move some outdoor tables in order to allow, because no restaurant allows six feet between tables normally.

638
00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:25,260
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge.

639
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:30,543
[SPEAKER_01]: So now John and Melanie are starting to check in on those restaurants.

640
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:37,912
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't need to come to you because if anything, we're asking them to reduce their seating, not expand it.

641
00:42:37,992 --> 00:42:41,774
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to do that, but we have to follow the guidelines.

642
00:42:41,974 --> 00:42:42,435
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

643
00:42:43,615 --> 00:42:44,156
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

644
00:42:44,376 --> 00:42:44,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.

645
00:42:45,717 --> 00:43:00,028
[SPEAKER_01]: But if any of those, that's probably, I mean, the idea of blocking off parking to allow additional tables, while it's something that could never have been conceived of before in Medford for some businesses, it's preferable.

646
00:43:00,448 --> 00:43:04,331
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd rather have a customer who has to walk two or three blocks than no customer.

647
00:43:05,112 --> 00:43:05,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

648
00:43:05,612 --> 00:43:07,494
[SPEAKER_01]: We're having those conversations now.

649
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:12,758
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why during these times, I think the city, it has been,

650
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:22,015
[SPEAKER_09]: but needs to continue to be very proactive to get these restaurants, give them a chance of making it and give them whatever they need to open in my mind.

651
00:43:22,675 --> 00:43:30,698
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the reason this commission will be very open and favorable to trying to do whatever we can to make it happen for them.

652
00:43:31,718 --> 00:43:35,020
[SPEAKER_09]: We will not be the stumbling block, so to speak.

653
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,920
[SPEAKER_09]: My pleasure.

654
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:39,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

655
00:43:42,974 --> 00:43:44,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have anything else on my agenda.

656
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,476
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody else have anything they'd like to bring up?

657
00:43:49,138 --> 00:43:50,219
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm good.

658
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:51,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Daria?

659
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,060
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it, I believe.

660
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:53,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

661
00:43:54,581 --> 00:43:54,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Dominic?

662
00:43:56,122 --> 00:43:56,502
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm good.

663
00:43:57,023 --> 00:44:02,746
[SPEAKER_13]: The chamber, I listen, I'm speaking, I'm sure for everybody and the board of directors and the president and so on.

664
00:44:03,187 --> 00:44:03,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

665
00:44:03,587 --> 00:44:05,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for what you just said, Jimmy.

666
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:12,680
[SPEAKER_13]: And Alan and Daria, you know, people always say, oh God, we got to go before the liquor commission.

667
00:44:13,381 --> 00:44:27,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Listen, they don't know sometimes how wonderful you guys are, you know, and how empathetic and how willing you are to cooperate and make things happen for people that are, especially now, that are just losing their shirts and so on.

668
00:44:27,412 --> 00:44:31,695
[SPEAKER_13]: So to everybody that ever asks me those questions and they call me day in and day out.

669
00:44:32,476 --> 00:44:33,836
[SPEAKER_13]: And the others say, no, no, no, no.

670
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:39,778
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's anything that they can do, unless it's illegal, it's only illegal, they are going to go out of their way to make it happen.

671
00:44:40,098 --> 00:44:50,361
[SPEAKER_13]: And this today, the Zoom proves that anybody that got on the Zoom, they will know that and hopefully pass a word along that you are extremely reasonable, you know, and in respect of the law, obviously.

672
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:57,183
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, thank you to all of you on behalf of me personally, of course, and the Chamber of Commerce and everybody else involved in these restaurants that

673
00:44:57,603 --> 00:45:03,185
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we've done everything we can to try to make them stay open, as you know, with the money we raise and the money and the gifts and things and so on.

674
00:45:03,225 --> 00:45:04,326
[SPEAKER_13]: And you guys are doing your part.

675
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:06,907
[SPEAKER_13]: So all the love in my heart for all of you.

676
00:45:07,427 --> 00:45:08,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for those very kind words.

677
00:45:09,048 --> 00:45:09,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

678
00:45:09,468 --> 00:45:10,909
[SPEAKER_09]: And thank you, Alicia, for your input.

679
00:45:10,929 --> 00:45:12,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Alicia, absolutely.

680
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:13,530
[SPEAKER_12]: All you guys at City Hall.

681
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,250
[SPEAKER_09]: You're more than welcome at any one of our meetings.

682
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:16,151
[SPEAKER_12]: And the mayor, all of you.

683
00:45:16,251 --> 00:45:16,551
[SPEAKER_12]: All of you.

684
00:45:16,571 --> 00:45:16,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

685
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:17,551
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

686
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:18,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

687
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:19,212
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's John.

688
00:45:19,232 --> 00:45:21,553
[SPEAKER_09]: That's John.

689
00:45:21,693 --> 00:45:22,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, John.

690
00:45:24,274 --> 00:45:24,874
[SPEAKER_09]: You're on mute.

691
00:45:25,435 --> 00:45:25,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there you are.

692
00:45:26,195 --> 00:45:26,515
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

693
00:45:27,948 --> 00:45:28,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

694
00:45:28,988 --> 00:45:30,469
[SPEAKER_09]: No, he's still on mute.

695
00:45:30,509 --> 00:45:31,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, John.

696
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:32,870
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good way to do it, Alicia.

697
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:37,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

698
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:44,593
[SPEAKER_10]: The only question that I had is, none of this has to be sent to ABCC, right?

699
00:45:44,613 --> 00:45:44,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you mind?

700
00:45:45,053 --> 00:45:45,614
[SPEAKER_09]: It does not.

701
00:45:46,254 --> 00:45:49,215
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we have the authority to do this on our own.

702
00:45:50,275 --> 00:45:56,297
[SPEAKER_09]: You just need to make a record diary of what the representation was for the alteration of premises.

703
00:45:57,583 --> 00:46:05,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, put it in their file and, um, you need to, um, also, uh, just make a note, um, of the expiration date.

704
00:46:06,126 --> 00:46:06,566
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

705
00:46:06,626 --> 00:46:07,426
[SPEAKER_09]: November 20th.

706
00:46:07,946 --> 00:46:09,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

707
00:46:09,327 --> 00:46:10,067
[SPEAKER_14]: November 20th.

708
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:10,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

709
00:46:11,047 --> 00:46:11,427
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

710
00:46:11,527 --> 00:46:13,108
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's November 20th, 2020.

711
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,609
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if there's a specific date.

712
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:17,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was the end of November or maybe it's November 1st.

713
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:19,450
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought it was November 1st, 2020.

714
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:19,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, okay.

715
00:46:23,734 --> 00:46:25,075
[SPEAKER_10]: So November 1st, 2020.

716
00:46:25,595 --> 00:46:25,816
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

717
00:46:25,856 --> 00:46:26,556
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my bad.

718
00:46:26,596 --> 00:46:27,997
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought it was November 20th, 2020.

719
00:46:28,398 --> 00:46:30,920
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I had all these twenties in my head.

720
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:31,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

721
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,743
[SPEAKER_09]: In this part of the country, it's probably not going to last beyond November 1st anyways with the weather.

722
00:46:36,244 --> 00:46:36,384
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

723
00:46:36,404 --> 00:46:36,984
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my guess.

724
00:46:37,284 --> 00:46:37,805
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

725
00:46:38,085 --> 00:46:38,826
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true.

726
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:40,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

727
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:41,147
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

728
00:46:41,187 --> 00:46:43,249
[SPEAKER_14]: A motion to adjourn that I guess would be in line.

729
00:46:43,729 --> 00:46:44,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

730
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,651
[SPEAKER_14]: A motion to adjourn.

731
00:46:45,791 --> 00:46:47,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, everyone.

732
00:46:47,686 --> 00:46:48,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Javier, great.
