[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham?

27
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:31,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

28
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin?

29
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:34,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Here.

30
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:38,063
[SPEAKER_00]: And Member Ruseau, present, three present.

31
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:39,103
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a quorum.

32
00:03:39,644 --> 00:03:43,026
[SPEAKER_00]: The agenda, I probably should have done the attendance first, my apologies.

33
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:44,848
[SPEAKER_00]: the agenda for tonight.

34
00:03:45,289 --> 00:04:00,314
[SPEAKER_00]: We have quite a few things on the agenda, and I'm going to take them in order, unless we find that item number one is going to take too much time, because item number two are policies that we need to get adopted right away for compliance.

35
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:06,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Item number one is the finalization of the annual reports and presentation schedule.

36
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:10,137
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to share my screen so that

37
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:14,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who doesn't have the document isn't wondering what we're talking about.

38
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:19,704
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the big green button.

39
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:40,892
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

40
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:42,814
[SPEAKER_00]: I can no longer so there everybody is.

41
00:04:44,255 --> 00:04:45,396
[SPEAKER_00]: So first item on the agenda.

42
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:54,843
[SPEAKER_00]: The school committee has been working on a subcommittee has been working on a schedule of annual reports and presentations that we receive.

43
00:04:55,783 --> 00:05:05,310
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the I drafted a policy that that the schedule would live in inside of.

44
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:07,772
[SPEAKER_00]: This is similar to what we did with the

45
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:12,737
[SPEAKER_00]: the calendar of observed days.

46
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:22,685
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a title, a purpose, which explains what's the purpose of this policy, sort of a, why are we here?

47
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:24,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the policy.

48
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:31,072
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see, should I read all these?

49
00:05:31,312 --> 00:05:35,035
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read these, because I'm not sure if everybody's had a chance to read all of this stuff yet.

50
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:39,378
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose is this annual reports and presentation schedule

51
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:47,526
[SPEAKER_00]: aims to provide clarity for school committee members and all other constituents when the superintendent or others will present to the school committee throughout the year.

52
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:54,631
[SPEAKER_00]: The hope is that by having this schedule, there can be, I'm gonna increase the size of this.

53
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:09,081
[SPEAKER_00]: The hope is that by having this schedule, there can be reduced duplication through requests that were already planned to happen, reduced inquiries about when a report or presentation will be scheduled,

54
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:17,645
[SPEAKER_00]: and simplification of scheduling for the central administration and other presenters as advance notice will be known.

55
00:06:17,665 --> 00:06:20,548
[SPEAKER_00]: As advance notice will be known.

56
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,330
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have to fix that sentence.

57
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:25,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just put a little comment there.

58
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:48,433
[SPEAKER_00]: This policy does not provide for comprehensive calendar of events or activities of the district and is only meant to specify reports or presentations the school committee will receive.

59
00:06:51,174 --> 00:06:51,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Policy.

60
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:56,776
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of this stuff may well make more sense than the purpose versus the policy.

61
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:58,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes these things are not always

62
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:00,709
[SPEAKER_00]: clear where they belong.

63
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:09,413
[SPEAKER_00]: The content of each report or presentation is not within the scope of this policy except as required in the description to make clear what the report or presentation is about.

64
00:07:10,574 --> 00:07:21,139
[SPEAKER_00]: A report or presentation may be an information only item added to the documents provided to the school committee for a meeting, or it may be an item for discussion or even a presentation.

65
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:26,341
[SPEAKER_00]: This policy does not specify how a report or presentation is provided to the school committee.

66
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:30,258
[SPEAKER_00]: This policy does not specify, it's an awful lot about what it doesn't do.

67
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:46,848
[SPEAKER_00]: This policy does not specify the date when a report or presentation will be provided to the school committee, but rather specifies the bracketed time that it is expected, such as the quarter, the first meeting of a month, or simply that a report or presentation is expected by annually, annually, or semi-annually.

68
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:55,674
[SPEAKER_00]: The superintendent in compliance with any other policies, rules, or procedures of the school committee will schedule specific dates for delivery of reports or presentations.

69
00:07:56,962 --> 00:08:01,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Ad hoc reports or presentations are, did everybody lose me?

70
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:03,187
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a trying to connect.

71
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:05,528
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still see?

72
00:08:07,109 --> 00:08:07,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

73
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Ad hoc reports or presentations are not covered by this policy and should follow the ad hoc report request procedure of the school committee.

74
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:18,958
[SPEAKER_00]: The report or presentation may be added to this schedule through the normal policy amendment process.

75
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:21,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Newly mandated reports or presentations

76
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:28,755
[SPEAKER_00]: from state or federal governments or regulators will be sent through the normal policy amendment process to ensure the accuracy of the schedule herein.

77
00:08:30,517 --> 00:08:40,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitions of the language used herein can be found at, and I don't know that we actually have a page on our website anywhere where we have a bunch of definitions.

78
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:45,106
[SPEAKER_00]: I know member McLaughlin has brought this up before that we need one.

79
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:48,589
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the moment it just says,

80
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:51,929
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a link, but I don't know that it exists yet.

81
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,673
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may have to change that if it doesn't exist, because, you know, cart before the horse kind of problem.

82
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:08,160
[SPEAKER_00]: The schedule below would be unreadable if all acronyms and other educational or financial language were clarified in line with the name or description of the report or presentation.

83
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:16,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, some of the language has been retained for brevity and clarity for the professional educators that will be using this schedule each year.

84
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:23,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Language has been simplified and made more accessible where possible without obscuring clarity for these stakeholders.

85
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:35,223
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our last meeting, I know we talked extensively about finding a way to make this frankly normal human readable rather than educator or finance speak.

86
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:46,132
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been done to some extent, but I think it would become an unusable schedule

87
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,271
[SPEAKER_00]: if we were to really expand that out all the way.

88
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:58,933
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just gonna, and then there's a spot here for, oh, I'm sorry, section three is the actual schedule.

89
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:06,914
[SPEAKER_00]: Statutory refers to regulation or law and does not include a reference to reports or presentations ordered through the school committee.

90
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:14,796
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, we have a statutory report to get a CPAC presentation annually, I believe, maybe I'm wrong, but I think we do.

91
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:28,073
[SPEAKER_00]: So that statutory would be true, but any other kinds of reports or presentations that our school committee has decided are required are not considered statutory for the purposes of this.

92
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:34,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Monthly reports or presentations for July and August shall be held until the first meeting in September.

93
00:10:34,696 --> 00:10:38,317
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna flip over to the actual document.

94
00:10:38,857 --> 00:10:39,338
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is,

95
00:10:41,213 --> 00:10:45,555
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much the document we created last time, but a lot taken out of the description.

96
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:53,778
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason was is that it got into what we wanted the report to actually look like.

97
00:10:54,178 --> 00:11:05,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And each and every one of these, frankly, should probably have in its own attached document that says, you know, this is what the school committee expects an annual attendance report to look like.

98
00:11:07,942 --> 00:11:21,789
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't wanna be doing this same policy four years from now, having never approved it, it seems like we need to kind of start high level and then go deeper as we can.

99
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:33,755
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how the other members feel about that, but that's just something when I took the minutes from the last meeting and how I went at it.

100
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:36,737
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the name, the meeting type,

101
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:48,359
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's statutory, frequency, any special details on when it's expected, such as before the budget is a good example.

102
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:49,580
[SPEAKER_00]: And then description.

103
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:59,566
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think everything should have a description of some sort, but how much of a description sort of becomes the conversation.

104
00:12:00,946 --> 00:12:05,569
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be nice if it would actually fit within a document that we're calling our policy.

105
00:12:08,507 --> 00:12:11,708
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done some reformatting of the names.

106
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:19,871
[SPEAKER_00]: I bolded everything that I feel like we have to answer before we could consider sending this up to the school committee.

107
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,933
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an item on here, the budget legal notice.

108
00:12:26,214 --> 00:12:31,616
[SPEAKER_00]: That one in particular made me wonder, is this, this is not a schedule of everything that needs to happen.

109
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:37,018
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think this budget legal notice is a report or presentation.

110
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,840
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a posting, a public posting.

111
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,483
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I bolded it as something to find out whether the members think we should remove from this list.

112
00:12:47,904 --> 00:12:49,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Whew, I've done a lot of talking.

113
00:12:55,028 --> 00:12:57,690
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gonna say, Member Ruseau, that

114
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:07,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Since this event takes place every year, maybe the description could be that it's a

115
00:13:08,528 --> 00:13:11,710
[SPEAKER_05]: under description, it's the legal notice.

116
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:20,075
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be a formal budget presentation that is for the community, but that were legally required.

117
00:13:20,655 --> 00:13:32,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's, this one needs to happen prior to the presentation to the city council.

118
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:58,720
[SPEAKER_05]: um where you have this legally you know to be in compliance it needs to be go to go out to the public so i think where it is something that will happen annually maybe yeah what you deleted could go under description that could be your description yeah and then yeah i mean um sorry

119
00:14:01,158 --> 00:14:07,361
[SPEAKER_00]: the notice, though, is the thing we put up that says there is a meeting, and this is what it is.

120
00:14:07,841 --> 00:14:12,844
[SPEAKER_00]: But the report of the presentation we're gonna get is the actual budget presentation.

121
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:25,430
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like the budget presentation, unless there is a very specific, it is statutory, it is annually.

122
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:28,972
[SPEAKER_00]: So prior to,

123
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:30,462
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

124
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Sending City Council.

125
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:34,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

126
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:37,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Um and.

127
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:42,271
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, I don't have to say and your man did it because it's sort of in this other stuff.

128
00:14:42,391 --> 00:14:42,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, good.

129
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:45,273
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad I didn't just yank it out of there.

130
00:14:46,114 --> 00:14:50,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Um there are some question marks that I don't think we have to answer before we send it up to the, um.

131
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,238
[SPEAKER_00]: Full school committee.

132
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:52,839
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the

133
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:03,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the bullying prevent presentation.

134
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:07,113
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've had some laws changed relatively recently around this stuff.

135
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:10,194
[SPEAKER_00]: So there may be a statutory requirement for that.

136
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:17,858
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like all of these, whether they're statutory needs to be question mark can't be the answer and blank can't be the answer.

137
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:27,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I think when the superintendent and her staff pull out this thing every year, um, it shouldn't be a question about whether they can skip it or not because it's because they're busy.

138
00:15:27,784 --> 00:15:29,765
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's, if it's statutory, it's statutory.

139
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:29,885
[SPEAKER_00]: And

140
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:35,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Why make you all go looking things up on the state's website?

141
00:15:37,056 --> 00:15:45,741
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't feel strongly we have to answer that question in this meeting, as long as we get those answers before we send it to the school committee, before the school committee receives it.

142
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:52,745
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of a meeting though, I think is really just for us to decide.

143
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:57,408
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these things are,

144
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:08,692
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these things I think are much easier to say is to put them on a regular meeting and then others, I think are worthy of being their own meeting.

145
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:16,895
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is, do we want to have 25 Committee of the Wholes already scheduled annually before we even begin any of our other work?

146
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:29,361
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like the before and after school services and finances presentation, does anybody feel strongly whether that should be a regular or a

147
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:31,819
[SPEAKER_00]: special or committee of the whole?

148
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,521
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that could be a regular meeting.

149
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:44,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in the past where we had challenges, if a challenge or a particular need were to arise, then we would definitely convert it to a committee of the whole.

150
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:55,137
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think annually having it at a regular meeting as a report, I think that that's a very reasonable expectation.

151
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:57,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham.

152
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:06,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my only comment to that would be the goal, at least in part,

153
00:17:07,397 --> 00:17:14,720
[SPEAKER_02]: for me is to do the financial review of the revolving accounts and to shed some light on that.

154
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:31,846
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just, I do wonder if any of these like financial reviews of our evolving accounts really should be part of the normal meeting or if there should be dedicated, you know, committee of the holes or whatever associated with them.

155
00:17:35,815 --> 00:17:36,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I could go either way.

156
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:48,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure if we're planning for these to be part of the regular meeting that we are allocating the time to an actual financial review, which is what we should be doing with all these revolving accounts on an annual basis.

157
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:52,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't particularly care about the format of the meeting.

158
00:17:52,687 --> 00:18:00,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure that whenever we do it, we're not just like sort of passing it along and not doing the financial review, which I think is the fundamental requirement.

159
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:09,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if I may, you know, under meeting type right now, there's essentially two, you know, regular committees at the hall.

160
00:18:11,194 --> 00:18:18,179
[SPEAKER_00]: We, I just feel like, you know, maybe this, maybe we did another type, like the budget, like a hearing.

161
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:20,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a budget, it's a budget meeting.

162
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:25,504
[SPEAKER_02]: And then whatever form that takes might, that might make more sense.

163
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:29,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I don't, we're not, I don't think we're tied

164
00:18:29,923 --> 00:18:34,166
[SPEAKER_00]: to these being some kind of like actual legal definition of what kind of meeting.

165
00:18:35,888 --> 00:18:42,093
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, but I think, you know, we have in the details that this has to be prior to the actual budget meetings.

166
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:50,940
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, okay, I think we could just leave that there for now.

167
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:57,365
[SPEAKER_00]: The bullying presentation, I think that needs to be a regular meeting for maximal,

168
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:01,427
[SPEAKER_00]: visibility, frankly.

169
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:03,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Superintendent, do you agree with that?

170
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think the bullying presentation definitely can happen at a regular meeting.

171
00:19:10,093 --> 00:19:11,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very comfortable with that.

172
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:12,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

173
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:21,642
[SPEAKER_00]: The capital improvement plan has been a committee of the whole in the past.

174
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:27,887
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt I put that in there with a question mark because I wasn't 100% sure we want to keep it that way, but

175
00:19:30,214 --> 00:19:31,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody have any feelings?

176
00:19:36,517 --> 00:19:43,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen us get to a point where we have an actual like functioning capital improvement plan.

177
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:49,562
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have pieces of what I would consider to be a functional capital improvement plan, but

178
00:19:50,291 --> 00:20:02,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I think until we really get a format and a cadence down about how things would surface to that list and how we would talk about it, I would keep it as a committee of the whole.

179
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:04,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thank you.

180
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:09,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just say, before you were, last year was a tough year to become a new member.

181
00:20:09,265 --> 00:20:14,629
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like the year before we had finally sort of gotten that worked out.

182
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:18,552
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last year, the idea of capital improvement seemed sort of,

183
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:24,188
[SPEAKER_00]: unreasonable, so we didn't have that committee of the whole, unfortunately.

184
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:26,909
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it did.

185
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:28,149
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was there.

186
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:29,289
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you were there.

187
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at the meeting.

188
00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:37,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it was the first time we did anything formal, but I would not say that it was fully functioning.

189
00:20:37,312 --> 00:20:45,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I remember hearing feedback that the principals were not consulted on what went on the list.

190
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:49,155
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're largely responsible for their buildings.

191
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:54,738
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, you know, I think there's just a process of like, how do things get surfaced to the list?

192
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:57,080
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens once they get on the list?

193
00:20:58,301 --> 00:21:00,762
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, those kinds of things that I think there's just still some work.

194
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:02,243
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still just work to do, that's all.

195
00:21:03,204 --> 00:21:04,204
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

196
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:08,367
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna skip down everything that doesn't have question marks in here.

197
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:12,789
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all from the old list that we looked at last time.

198
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:33,518
[SPEAKER_00]: changed the ordering of the language a bit so that, you know, the finance reports are kind of, you know, like in this prior year fiscal audit draft, prior year fiscal audit final, prior year fiscal report final, like there was some different language that would cause them to sort differently.

199
00:21:34,633 --> 00:21:36,454
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've cleaned these all up.

200
00:21:36,894 --> 00:21:40,195
[SPEAKER_00]: This one here, the grievance, Member McLaughlin, were you gonna?

201
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,376
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, excuse me, Paul, just for a second.

202
00:21:41,396 --> 00:21:44,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you mind doing the same, increasing the font on this, please?

203
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I don't know why I'm picking up so little.

204
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:48,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.

205
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:50,559
[SPEAKER_00]: There, that better?

206
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,502
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grievances report, we have asked for that a couple of times.

207
00:21:56,622 --> 00:21:59,743
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, my understanding of what we want is we wanna know

208
00:22:00,388 --> 00:22:01,888
[SPEAKER_00]: How many grievances were there?

209
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:03,929
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that compare historically?

210
00:22:04,029 --> 00:22:10,910
[SPEAKER_00]: How many were resolved in the different levels of grievance management and resolution?

211
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:19,112
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not, I actually don't think that is, it would be covered under executive session.

212
00:22:19,132 --> 00:22:20,752
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about a grievance.

213
00:22:20,792 --> 00:22:23,173
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about, you know, like how many were there this year?

214
00:22:23,193 --> 00:22:23,833
[SPEAKER_00]: So,

215
00:22:26,543 --> 00:22:30,705
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking we have to throw that into a regular meeting.

216
00:22:31,806 --> 00:22:33,927
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this can be just a report.

217
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:42,532
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't necessarily have to be a presentation unless, of course, we discover that grievances have gone through the roof and we want to understand why.

218
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,353
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we have a special meeting about that.

219
00:22:44,393 --> 00:22:44,933
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin.

220
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,931
[SPEAKER_03]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator, PBI's Office of Communications and the Communications Committee.

221
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:52,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Paul.

222
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:59,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean to interrupt, but now that you're speaking of it and I'm looking down, thank you for making these alphabetically as well.

223
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:05,412
[SPEAKER_03]: legal issues as well.

224
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:10,876
[SPEAKER_03]: So for grievance report, and I don't know if it would be again, executive session or not, but I'm more interested in data.

225
00:23:11,497 --> 00:23:27,068
[SPEAKER_03]: So specifically, things that have gone to hearing or that when a hearing has been filed to a legal report when there is, you know, case, you know, when there's legal action, right?

226
00:23:27,108 --> 00:23:28,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

227
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:29,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And expenditures.

228
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:29,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for both.

229
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:30,991
[SPEAKER_03]: For Yeah,

230
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:37,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether it's civil rights, special education, anything like that would be really helpful data-wise, again, not specifics.

231
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:38,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

232
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:40,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

233
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:42,365
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, we've talked about several times.

234
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:42,826
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.

235
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:43,626
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

236
00:23:43,906 --> 00:23:50,789
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so moving on, I'm gonna try and get us to be at the halfway point and be halfway through the agenda.

237
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:56,552
[SPEAKER_00]: The health services report, I'm gonna skip down to only the ones that actually, so pre-budget.

238
00:23:57,753 --> 00:23:59,113
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like the thing we just had last,

239
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:03,111
[SPEAKER_00]: on Monday night was the pre-budget meeting.

240
00:24:03,832 --> 00:24:06,113
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the presentation, the pre-budget presentation.

241
00:24:06,173 --> 00:24:07,854
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what everybody else thought that that was?

242
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:12,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a no.

243
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:17,499
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what this is exactly.

244
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,921
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find it hard to put it in here.

245
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,062
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham.

246
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:24,523
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think the,

247
00:24:25,671 --> 00:24:38,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what it probably means is our series of pre-budget meetings that we have where we review all the departments, we go through their narratives and their budgets and their lists.

248
00:24:38,363 --> 00:24:40,224
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think it's a meeting.

249
00:24:40,284 --> 00:24:41,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a series of meetings.

250
00:24:42,767 --> 00:24:46,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought what we went through on Monday night was like,

251
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,051
[SPEAKER_02]: like the kickoff of the budget season essentially, right?

252
00:24:51,111 --> 00:25:00,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was great because it, I thought it did a better job than the district has really ever done in saying like, this is how, this is how school budgets are created.

253
00:25:02,695 --> 00:25:08,076
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know, last year we had a meeting where we talked about things we wanted to see in the budget.

254
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:13,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we sort of did that on Monday night, but I, you know,

255
00:25:16,393 --> 00:25:24,059
[SPEAKER_02]: I considered that more like the kickoff than I did like the whole like pre-budget season.

256
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:26,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

257
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:26,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin.

258
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:28,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would concur.

259
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:38,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna say it's both and I think it's, this would be, you know, what was presented the other night should be, I think the beginning of the budget sort of pre-budget.

260
00:25:43,448 --> 00:25:47,711
[SPEAKER_03]: and in the future, I would like to see that sort of consistently every year that that's sort of the beginning.

261
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:48,772
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how it all works.

262
00:25:48,872 --> 00:25:51,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we wrap it up, this is how it all works.

263
00:25:51,414 --> 00:25:54,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of a good, you know, teaching best practice that we do that.

264
00:25:54,956 --> 00:26:07,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would agree with member Graham that the pre-budget meetings themselves were meetings with each department was sort of, we had the big picture overall and they were more than one meeting, but.

265
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,847
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you.

266
00:26:10,967 --> 00:26:12,388
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes so much.

267
00:26:12,939 --> 00:26:13,720
[SPEAKER_00]: more sense to me now.

268
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,962
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see.

269
00:26:19,063 --> 00:26:21,044
[SPEAKER_00]: What other ones were in here with question marks?

270
00:26:22,045 --> 00:26:27,309
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a school open house schedule, which I completely agree should be a presentation or a report.

271
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:29,030
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wasn't sure.

272
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:39,637
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the kindergarten open houses, we have the middle school open houses, we also have high school for the incoming ninth graders.

273
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:47,161
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this was supposed to mean all of them this globally.

274
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:52,867
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, I'll just break it out into three because they would happen at different times of year, of course.

275
00:26:54,428 --> 00:26:57,151
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that how everybody sort of understands that?

276
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:01,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, good.

277
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:14,276
[SPEAKER_00]: So the short collaborative report or presentation, there was some good notes on that.

278
00:27:14,336 --> 00:27:17,958
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, I have too many tabs open and that's not one of them.

279
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:25,143
[SPEAKER_00]: But my question was, should this actually be more of an out of district placement presentation rather than specific?

280
00:27:25,403 --> 00:27:25,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

281
00:27:31,046 --> 00:27:38,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the only thing I would say is, again, the short collaborative is a specific revolving account.

282
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:46,665
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had that meeting and it was, I thought it was really helpful information, but we didn't talk at all about the details of the revolving accounts.

283
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:52,469
[SPEAKER_02]: So not all out of district places are associated with a revolving account in the same way.

284
00:27:52,569 --> 00:28:00,456
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's just a nuance that I wanna make sure it doesn't get lost because it's our responsibility to be looking at those revolving accounts.

285
00:28:00,476 --> 00:28:03,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

286
00:28:05,222 --> 00:28:06,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I would concur.

287
00:28:06,502 --> 00:28:12,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that I, you know, I'm looking for the aggregated and disaggregated data on the added district placement.

288
00:28:12,344 --> 00:28:19,146
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and if any of them obviously are revolving accounts, then I think that should be, you know, made known.

289
00:28:19,206 --> 00:28:30,709
[SPEAKER_03]: And then member Graham or through the chair, if member Graham would clarify for folks who are going to be watching this in a recording or who else are on the line, how would you define a revolving account, please?

290
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:55,504
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a list of revolving accounts that are established, I think by regulation at the State House that govern any instances where we are taking in revenue that is coming in sort of separate and apart from our city appropriation, separate and apart from our grant funding.

291
00:28:56,837 --> 00:29:00,208
[SPEAKER_02]: But the accounts are set up to do just that, to revolve.

292
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,856
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can take money in, we can pay money out.

293
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:05,203
[SPEAKER_02]: on any of those accounts.

294
00:29:06,303 --> 00:29:14,366
[SPEAKER_02]: There are lots of like legal and compliance issues associated with what you can take in and out of each one and how the money is spent.

295
00:29:15,146 --> 00:29:26,810
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are working actively on creating a more clear way to describe that those processes with all of those independent revolving accounts, because they are all a little bit different.

296
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So that when people look at those numbers, there's some context of what they are.

297
00:29:33,865 --> 00:29:38,267
[SPEAKER_02]: is like, you know, if there's $100,000 in a revolving account, is that a good thing?

298
00:29:38,347 --> 00:29:39,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a bad thing?

299
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:40,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is, it depends.

300
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:50,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So really sort of adding some context around what's the like nature and purpose of the revolving account, and then how do we account for all the funds that go in and out?

301
00:29:52,214 --> 00:29:52,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

302
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:59,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think going back to the, you know, the idea of definitions, you know, that is one that I would be adding.

303
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:03,617
[SPEAKER_03]: so that, you know, the community as a whole knows what that actually means.

304
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:04,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

305
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:05,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

306
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

307
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:12,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, um, you know, like anything, this is a starting point, not an end point.

308
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:20,450
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, in order to get the ball rolling, is there a motion to

309
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:31,573
[SPEAKER_00]: approve this to send to the full committee with the updates that I have here and we'll finish prior to that actually getting there and all of these question marks getting filled in.

310
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:33,694
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to approve.

311
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:34,714
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

312
00:30:35,894 --> 00:30:36,274
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

313
00:30:36,994 --> 00:30:38,975
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I have to take the roll call on this.

314
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:40,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham?

315
00:30:40,995 --> 00:30:41,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

316
00:30:42,396 --> 00:30:43,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin?

317
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

318
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,049
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Ruseau, yes, three in the affirmative.

319
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:52,591
[SPEAKER_00]: The policy is approved to send to the full committee at our next meeting.

320
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,651
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, I appreciate the work on moving through this.

321
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:57,432
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a lot of detail.

322
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:03,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so let's move on to- Member Ruseau, I also just wanna say thank you for putting that together.

323
00:31:03,973 --> 00:31:04,773
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a lot of work.

324
00:31:07,314 --> 00:31:09,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Helpful for all of us, so thank you.

325
00:31:10,321 --> 00:31:12,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize there are other people on this meeting.

326
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:16,724
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody has any questions, don't hesitate to just, if you can unmute yourself, do that.

327
00:31:17,365 --> 00:31:27,190
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see the people very well since I have the sharing going on, but don't hesitate to wave your hands if one of us will probably notice, I hope.

328
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:33,653
[SPEAKER_00]: So next on the agenda were policies that will be considered.

329
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:39,516
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the policy JB, which is equal educational opportunities, not that one.

330
00:31:41,055 --> 00:31:44,016
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have it on screen.

331
00:31:44,957 --> 00:31:52,359
[SPEAKER_00]: The current policy that exists on our policy manual online has an outdated version of this.

332
00:31:52,899 --> 00:31:58,941
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the latest version based on the recommendations from the school committee association.

333
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:06,864
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless anybody has any questions or concerns about the language here,

334
00:32:08,363 --> 00:32:09,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a motion?

335
00:32:09,103 --> 00:32:10,984
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read all of these.

336
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:14,905
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there a motion to approve and send to the full school committee?

337
00:32:16,405 --> 00:32:17,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to approve?

338
00:32:18,046 --> 00:32:18,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

339
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:20,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

340
00:32:20,826 --> 00:32:23,807
[SPEAKER_00]: And excellent.

341
00:32:24,307 --> 00:32:30,829
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the motion to approve policy JB, educational, equal educational opportunities.

342
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:32,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham?

343
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:33,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

344
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,610
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin?

345
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:37,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

346
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:38,537
[SPEAKER_00]: member.

347
00:32:38,577 --> 00:32:40,038
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, three in the affirmative.

348
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,362
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be sent up to the school committee for their consideration.

349
00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:45,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Glawson?

350
00:32:45,342 --> 00:32:45,903
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

351
00:32:46,003 --> 00:32:49,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I have a reconsideration of the motion?

352
00:32:50,127 --> 00:32:50,807
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies.

353
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:55,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Physical and intellectual abilities, if we could.

354
00:32:57,133 --> 00:32:57,993
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a differences?

355
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:58,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.

356
00:33:00,656 --> 00:33:01,557
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any problem with that.

357
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:04,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham, do you have any problem with that?

358
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:04,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

359
00:33:04,959 --> 00:33:05,500
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

360
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:13,883
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, great, thank you, and I will move on.

361
00:33:13,903 --> 00:33:22,546
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next one is policy JFABD, policies and procedures, homeless student support services.

362
00:33:25,187 --> 00:33:27,787
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an update as well.

363
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:37,010
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually, I believe this is actually a pretty substantial change over the old one we had.

364
00:33:37,838 --> 00:33:39,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um.

365
00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:46,224
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the ones that are mandated for the upcoming, um.

366
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:51,448
[SPEAKER_00]: Audit or whatever they call those inspection inspections.

367
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:52,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham.

368
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:54,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a couple of.

369
00:33:56,552 --> 00:34:03,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Items here, and I thought I actually tagged them in the Google drive, but I'm not seeing them on your copy, so I'll just tell you what they are.

370
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:11,398
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first paragraph where it says, including Head Start comparable preschool programs.

371
00:34:17,363 --> 00:34:24,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see, including, I would say including, but not limited to, and I was also a little bit further down in that list of options.

372
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:28,170
[SPEAKER_02]: It lists gifted and talented programs.

373
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:31,473
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would actually recommend that we

374
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:41,202
[SPEAKER_02]: strike that, because A, we don't have it, but B, that's a different nut for another day.

375
00:34:41,222 --> 00:34:43,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would recommend that we remove that.

376
00:34:44,204 --> 00:34:49,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you go down to page two at the bottom,

377
00:34:50,727 --> 00:35:12,309
[SPEAKER_02]: This paragraph that starts with, if the student does not have immediate access to immunization records, I think this is basically saying that students can still enroll under a personal exception and that students and families will be encouraged to get their documents as soon as possible and the district liaison is directed to assist.

378
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:34,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my question was, is it our policy that they will assist just with like getting the records or if students lack immunization, is the district liaison also going to help ensure that they have like appropriate access to a provider who can help them get their immunizations?

379
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?

380
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,722
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like paperwork or is it immunization or is it both?

381
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:42,124
[SPEAKER_05]: superintendent?

382
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:57,210
[SPEAKER_05]: I interpret it to be both that we would be able to support them through our medical office and you know get them either you know support them in getting additional medical care to get their immunizations.

383
00:35:58,231 --> 00:36:05,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that's something that the medical office the health services department definitely supports families in

384
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:06,794
[SPEAKER_05]: getting it done.

385
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:26,882
[SPEAKER_05]: There are, you know, I think a few families maybe for religious purposes that may not believe in vaccinations, but almost everyone else, they have support in accessing doctors and getting immunized and having it properly documented.

386
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:49,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So perhaps we can just say the district liaison is directed to assist in obtaining available records and or immunization or something like that that calls that out.

387
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:54,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when I read it, I was like, are we worried about paperwork or like students being immunized?

388
00:36:54,492 --> 00:36:55,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's both.

389
00:36:55,352 --> 00:36:57,273
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanna make sure it says that.

390
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:00,113
[SPEAKER_00]: How's that sound?

391
00:37:01,254 --> 00:37:04,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Directed to assist in obtaining available records or accessing immunization services.

392
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:05,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

393
00:37:07,117 --> 00:37:08,218
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

394
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:16,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the next page under dispute resolution, what is that number two and that number three?

395
00:37:18,024 --> 00:37:22,226
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me doing a really bad job of copying and pasting.

396
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:27,309
[SPEAKER_00]: At present, it's a link to the wrong thing.

397
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:34,348
[SPEAKER_00]: when I pasted, these are just an example of one here.

398
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:37,770
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually footnotes.

399
00:37:39,471 --> 00:37:42,212
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I copied and pasted, there's one right here.

400
00:37:42,232 --> 00:37:55,120
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I copied and pasted, it actually converted it into the same thing that you're seeing here, where it has, bizarrely, it has a particular policy that is actually

401
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:57,682
[SPEAKER_00]: advisory committee policy.

402
00:37:57,782 --> 00:37:59,823
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a clue why it's doing that.

403
00:38:00,884 --> 00:38:02,905
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will fix those.

404
00:38:03,065 --> 00:38:03,685
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

405
00:38:04,465 --> 00:38:10,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, if this is a list of something I'm missing item number one, because it's like, that's what caught my eye.

406
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, wait, there's links here.

407
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:12,749
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure what they are.

408
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:13,950
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to point that out.

409
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

410
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:17,692
[SPEAKER_02]: That was those were all of my questions on this one.

411
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

412
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,461
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for noticing it.

413
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:30,024
[SPEAKER_00]: I did look for them, but apparently I missed those.

414
00:38:32,486 --> 00:38:34,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin, did you have any other comments?

415
00:38:35,629 --> 00:38:36,309
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thank you.

416
00:38:36,329 --> 00:38:38,471
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

417
00:38:39,031 --> 00:38:39,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to approve.

418
00:38:39,772 --> 00:38:41,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a second?

419
00:38:42,874 --> 00:38:43,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

420
00:38:43,114 --> 00:38:44,295
[SPEAKER_00]: As amended once I finish that.

421
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:45,516
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

422
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:46,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham.

423
00:38:47,178 --> 00:38:47,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

424
00:38:48,278 --> 00:38:48,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin.

425
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:49,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

426
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Ruseau, yes.

427
00:38:51,721 --> 00:38:52,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Three in the affirmative.

428
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:53,082
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be

429
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,571
[SPEAKER_00]: fixed and sent up to the school committee for the next agenda.

430
00:38:58,131 --> 00:38:58,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all.

431
00:38:58,831 --> 00:39:03,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, the next one is J-F-A-B-E.

432
00:39:06,074 --> 00:39:06,554
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.

433
00:39:06,574 --> 00:39:10,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, did I include any of those mistakes in that?

434
00:39:11,175 --> 00:39:11,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see them.

435
00:39:13,296 --> 00:39:15,636
[SPEAKER_00]: So Susie, hi.

436
00:39:16,977 --> 00:39:17,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you unmute?

437
00:39:21,848 --> 00:39:28,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I've realized that the version you're working from, Paul, is not the version that Jenny made the corrections on.

438
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:34,254
[SPEAKER_01]: So the version in the folder is the one where you can see that.

439
00:39:34,454 --> 00:39:40,836
[SPEAKER_01]: So either work from yours and then send them over to me after, or just reshare them with me.

440
00:39:41,537 --> 00:39:42,197
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thank you.

441
00:39:42,237 --> 00:39:48,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I went into the folder today, and Google is not showing me any of those files, even though it

442
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:52,745
[SPEAKER_00]: I, anyways, we'll worry about Google drive later.

443
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:53,925
[SPEAKER_01]: So just that's Jenny.

444
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:56,726
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you're not seeing your, um, your it's fine.

445
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:59,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally, I was just putting them in before the meeting.

446
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:04,149
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but I did have a couple of questions about this one under definitions.

447
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we talk about children enrolled kindergarten through 12.

448
00:40:09,051 --> 00:40:12,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, does this policy need to cover our pre-K students?

449
00:40:17,455 --> 00:40:26,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say since we have pre-K students, why don't we just add pre, just the, yeah, pre-K through 12, so it covers everyone.

450
00:40:28,641 --> 00:40:29,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

451
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Maya, excuse me.

452
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:31,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

453
00:40:31,503 --> 00:40:38,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I also would say, you know, what about our transition students, superintendent, so our 18 to 22?

454
00:40:48,455 --> 00:40:49,036
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.

455
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:51,576
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a very good question.

456
00:40:57,718 --> 00:41:01,418
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, when we go down to the legal references, that might actually answer the question.

457
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Interstate compact.

458
00:41:04,779 --> 00:41:08,420
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can take this as the to-do.

459
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,221
[SPEAKER_00]: We do want to get this approved.

460
00:41:10,361 --> 00:41:15,322
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would be happy to take this as a to-do to look at

461
00:41:16,376 --> 00:41:31,519
[SPEAKER_00]: to find out what this even says, because I frankly don't know, and amend the text to include those adults if the interstate compact does include them.

462
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:42,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we can send it up as is and put it right back on the agenda to amend, but we do need to have at least this for the audit or whatever it's called.

463
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:44,041
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go either way.

464
00:41:44,061 --> 00:41:44,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, Graham?

465
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:55,871
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one other on page two in the third bullet, there's another reference to gifted and talented programs that we should strike.

466
00:41:56,652 --> 00:41:57,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.

467
00:42:00,175 --> 00:42:03,619
[SPEAKER_00]: And English as a second language is actually, we call it English learners.

468
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:07,803
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the preferred language now.

469
00:42:16,236 --> 00:42:20,839
[SPEAKER_02]: And other than that, I'm fine with this, if you can confirm.

470
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:26,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a motion to approve as amended.

471
00:42:29,483 --> 00:42:32,865
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the pending confirmation, right?

472
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:33,105
[SPEAKER_00]: 23, yes, 22.

473
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:33,485
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it 22?

474
00:42:33,525 --> 00:42:33,485
22.

475
00:42:33,565 --> 00:42:33,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

476
00:42:39,164 --> 00:42:42,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are called the transitional, is that what they're?

477
00:42:42,565 --> 00:42:44,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Transition program, I think is, yep.

478
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:45,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Transition to adulthood.

479
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,288
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just call it transition program, Paul.

480
00:42:55,528 --> 00:43:04,130
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's just the language of it, school-age children enrolled in pre-K through 12th grade.

481
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:08,031
[SPEAKER_00]: I could then put, you know, as well as,

482
00:43:08,598 --> 00:43:11,679
[SPEAKER_03]: or including, yeah, the transition program 18 to 22.

483
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:22,564
[SPEAKER_03]: I think transition might be capital T, but just, yeah.

484
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:23,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

485
00:43:23,144 --> 00:43:24,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

486
00:43:25,325 --> 00:43:35,970
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will put that in parentheses or whatever, depending on what the law says.

487
00:43:38,226 --> 00:43:39,967
[SPEAKER_00]: And Susie, do you have your hand up still?

488
00:43:39,987 --> 00:43:41,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you just did not lower it.

489
00:43:41,287 --> 00:43:42,188
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you have another question?

490
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:45,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

491
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:47,590
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

492
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:50,191
[SPEAKER_00]: So were there any other comments?

493
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else in the meeting have anything to say on it?

494
00:43:54,473 --> 00:43:54,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.

495
00:43:54,913 --> 00:43:58,755
[SPEAKER_00]: And so was there, I believe somebody made a motion.

496
00:43:58,775 --> 00:44:02,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

497
00:44:02,836 --> 00:44:03,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I was amended.

498
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:04,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

499
00:44:05,618 --> 00:44:06,518
[SPEAKER_00]: So member Graham?

500
00:44:12,038 --> 00:44:12,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you lose?

501
00:44:12,398 --> 00:44:14,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sorry, I lost my mouse.

502
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:14,440
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

503
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't get to the mute button.

504
00:44:16,942 --> 00:44:17,963
[SPEAKER_00]: And member McLaughlin?

505
00:44:18,343 --> 00:44:18,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

506
00:44:19,384 --> 00:44:21,345
[SPEAKER_00]: And member Rossell, yes, three in the affirmative.

507
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:32,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I will send this up to the full committee for hopefully for approval pending the updates, the outcome of what I find out on those.

508
00:44:33,255 --> 00:44:40,020
[SPEAKER_00]: And next we have, listen, we have to do this in the correct order.

509
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,356
[SPEAKER_00]: GBEBD.

510
00:44:43,077 --> 00:44:47,818
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason we have to do this one in the correct order is this one is actually referenced by the other one.

511
00:44:49,178 --> 00:44:55,280
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a policy that somehow we don't have.

512
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:02,942
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the policy on online fundraising, crowd funding and solicitations.

513
00:45:03,122 --> 00:45:06,523
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from, I have not made any changes to this one.

514
00:45:06,683 --> 00:45:08,543
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the text right out of the

515
00:45:11,003 --> 00:45:12,244
[SPEAKER_00]: policy service we use.

516
00:45:12,664 --> 00:45:14,146
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've made any changes.

517
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:15,867
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

518
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:19,430
[SPEAKER_00]: And member Graham's hand's up.

519
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,752
[SPEAKER_00]: So, member Graham.

520
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,976
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a couple of maybe questions for the superintendent.

521
00:45:25,996 --> 00:45:28,598
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really around like

522
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:45,927
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit around how, how does this actually work so and the reason I asked is because I've been told by teachers that they've been told they can't do these very things by various members of the leadership team over the years and.

523
00:45:46,507 --> 00:45:48,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's like still the case or not.

524
00:45:48,748 --> 00:45:55,812
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming it's not if we're creating this policy, but there's definitely like a vibe out there that this is not this is not allowable.

525
00:45:56,772 --> 00:46:07,598
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just, you know, a couple of things that jumped out at me like in the third paragraph, we talk about the prince, you know, they need to communicate to the principles around

526
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:12,536
[SPEAKER_02]: any sort of online fundraising or crowdsourcing they're going to do.

527
00:46:12,556 --> 00:46:24,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would like to see that be tracked consistently because I would like to have some visibility into what things teachers are out fundraising for that the district is not providing.

528
00:46:24,924 --> 00:46:28,186
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sort of in a related sense,

529
00:46:28,906 --> 00:46:41,835
[SPEAKER_02]: If you scroll down to the bottom of that page, it says employees using crowdfunding services shall periodically disclose the individuals who have supported.

530
00:46:41,855 --> 00:46:49,700
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend that that actually be a requirement at the completion of such an event.

531
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually, they're fairly time limited.

532
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:56,545
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, doing that in a way that is consistent across

533
00:46:57,473 --> 00:47:12,283
[SPEAKER_02]: buildings and teachers that is seamless that doesn't create like a pile of work for Susie or somebody else, but provide some visibility to us about about things that are being funded and that and and whatnot, and then.

534
00:47:14,388 --> 00:47:19,573
[SPEAKER_02]: In that same paragraph, it says the superintendent shall maintain these disclosures as public records available for public review.

535
00:47:19,593 --> 00:47:40,390
[SPEAKER_02]: I would actually love to see this become an annual report that is informative to us at budget time, because if our teachers are, you know, if all of our teachers are out fundraising for something like headphones, right, and I know we've got a lot of headphones right now, so that's probably not something they're gonna do, but if they're all out fundraising for headphones,

536
00:47:42,547 --> 00:47:51,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the school committee needs to know that that's a deficiency in the structure of the budget, that these things that are being requested universally are not being provided.

537
00:47:51,931 --> 00:48:07,736
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think in this similar spirit to wanting to understand PTOs and other organizations that are fundraising to supplement school budgets, I would like to see us codify this in some way.

538
00:48:07,776 --> 00:48:10,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not necessarily, I don't have a lot of changes to this

539
00:48:12,227 --> 00:48:19,394
[SPEAKER_02]: document, but it's more of, I think, a process question and maybe it needs to tie back to the report list that we just talked about.

540
00:48:20,454 --> 00:48:46,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to comment, Member Graham, that to your point where we could have the crowdsourcing services using the GoFundMe pages, our hope would be if, for example, PTOs are fundraising for a specific item, and then you also have multiple

541
00:48:47,883 --> 00:49:14,129
[SPEAKER_05]: people fundraising or using the GoFundMe for the same exact services, that we have been very clear that when GoFundMe or if people were to attempt to use those things that we would need to be in the know in order to supervise and make sure that it's being used for what the intent is.

542
00:49:14,669 --> 00:49:16,590
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say that because

543
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:27,736
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, technology and requesting things on behalf of a school that may not end up eventually being used with students within the district.

544
00:49:29,377 --> 00:49:32,519
[SPEAKER_05]: That is something that we need to just be very aware of.

545
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:38,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And so not to say that people don't have the best of intentions,

546
00:49:38,763 --> 00:49:47,787
[SPEAKER_05]: But unfortunately, it's kind of like a very slippery slope that there definitely needs to be close supervision.

547
00:49:48,307 --> 00:50:06,835
[SPEAKER_05]: If the PTO is purchasing headphones with the microphone, and someone else is also purchasing Bose headphones at the same exact time, and when you look for the inventory and say, oh, Bose headphones were ordered,

548
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:09,436
[SPEAKER_05]: and you ask, where are they?

549
00:50:09,616 --> 00:50:11,297
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're not able to come across them.

550
00:50:11,657 --> 00:50:22,543
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was where we were very clear, not that we were trying to stifle people wanting to take advantage of what's available.

551
00:50:22,983 --> 00:50:24,283
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be aligned.

552
00:50:24,463 --> 00:50:33,288
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to be, I would say it needs to be in complete alignment with what's already available.

553
00:50:34,814 --> 00:50:42,624
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, at the schools, and so principals need to be involved I just feel with the GoFundMe pages.

554
00:50:44,346 --> 00:50:48,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes, you know, you hit a goldmine, and it's something wonderful.

555
00:50:51,377 --> 00:51:15,748
[SPEAKER_05]: something is acquired, it needs to be stamped or labeled with Medford Public Schools and sometimes you have, you know, someone in Medford Public Schools and then they relocate to Connecticut and they say, well, I got this as a teacher, I'm taking the Bose headphones with me to, you know, a public school system in another state and

556
00:51:17,496 --> 00:51:24,427
[SPEAKER_05]: those items should belong and be cataloged as property of Medford Public Schools.

557
00:51:24,847 --> 00:51:26,590
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we have been.

558
00:51:28,578 --> 00:51:38,923
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, providing strong oversight and making sure that it's something that's documented and that we're aware of where it's going at, you know, any given point in time.

559
00:51:39,803 --> 00:51:53,070
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where the, um, the restrictions are, but where the PTOs have, you know, the liberty to be able to say we're doing this, it would be redundant to allow people to ask for the same exact

560
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:58,793
[SPEAKER_05]: know, multiple of headphones or whatever, whatever else it may be.

561
00:51:59,473 --> 00:51:59,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

562
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:01,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree.

563
00:52:01,614 --> 00:52:11,980
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, the whole notion of like, how we asset tag these things is a different can of worms like I, you know, I, I've been involved in

564
00:52:12,878 --> 00:52:18,545
[SPEAKER_02]: PTOs, you know, with my kids and, you know, there was a year we bought rugs for every teacher.

565
00:52:19,286 --> 00:52:24,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Those rugs, you know, I think if you ask the PTO, they would be like, yeah, we gave them to the teachers.

566
00:52:25,253 --> 00:52:31,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And the PTOs are sort of, you know, it's not top of mind for them and through no criticism to say,

567
00:52:32,702 --> 00:52:33,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Who am I giving this to?

568
00:52:33,683 --> 00:52:40,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I giving this to Marice Edouard-Vincent or am I giving this to the school and Marice Edouard-Vincent's going to use it?

569
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:45,934
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably like a sort of a sidebar discussion that we could have about that.

570
00:52:46,054 --> 00:52:51,919
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly if we're taking an equipment, it should definitely be asset tagged so it can be tracked.

571
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:57,164
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I just, as I was reading this, I wasn't sure that,

572
00:52:58,244 --> 00:53:11,388
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not there was a way for it to be clear to the school committee what those things are so that we can have a sense of like where the funding is falling short or how teachers are innovating in their classroom.

573
00:53:11,528 --> 00:53:14,109
[SPEAKER_02]: So those were all of my comments.

574
00:53:14,129 --> 00:53:20,471
[SPEAKER_02]: They were sort of all tied up in the same sort of thought process for this one.

575
00:53:21,623 --> 00:53:22,764
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Member Graham.

576
00:53:23,224 --> 00:53:25,766
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Cushing, I think you handed up.

577
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:26,827
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two of you now.

578
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:27,968
[SPEAKER_04]: There is.

579
00:53:28,388 --> 00:53:31,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I seem to be having some stability issues on my main desktop.

580
00:53:32,531 --> 00:53:36,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I warble in speaking, just let me know and I can switch quickly.

581
00:53:37,655 --> 00:53:41,077
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the big high level policy.

582
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:43,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think periodically would actually be fine.

583
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:48,603
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we would do is we would create an internal procedure

584
00:53:49,707 --> 00:53:55,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Form for approval that would be shared with central office central office would be the approval.

585
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:00,332
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I would say is like superintendent or superintendent designee.

586
00:54:01,212 --> 00:54:04,974
[SPEAKER_04]: And what this does is there's no mechanism right now.

587
00:54:05,614 --> 00:54:10,177
[SPEAKER_04]: to allow for these things or to not allow, and I'll give you one example.

588
00:54:10,817 --> 00:54:19,042
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an organization that started up at some point, offering a free extra monitor to make sure that all teachers had two monitors.

589
00:54:19,582 --> 00:54:23,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can donate to that in financial means and then they will literally send

590
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:27,006
[SPEAKER_04]: a monitor, an extra monitor to a teacher.

591
00:54:27,086 --> 00:54:38,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, that's something that would be wonderful for a lot of our situations, but there's no actual mechanism to say, yes, as a Medford Public Schools employee, it's okay to do that.

592
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:42,032
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this policy will give us the mechanism to do that.

593
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:56,441
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for us to implement the procedure, not the policy, the procedure will be the arm that allows us to put up like the rules, regulations, different things like that.

594
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:15,217
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you wanna read what people are putting out there so that it doesn't sound like the district isn't providing anything, but how are you doing these things in a manner that is respecting the taxpayers of Medford, all right, but saying that it might be something additional.

595
00:55:15,417 --> 00:55:24,881
[SPEAKER_04]: While also going to member Graham's point of, we wanna track these things for the future so that if there is a lot of one request that

596
00:55:25,381 --> 00:55:28,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something that the district should be allocating resources for?

597
00:55:29,924 --> 00:55:43,112
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think periodically is okay, especially in longer term ones, but our procedure would definitely have that end of term, end of run piece for it to be there.

598
00:55:45,733 --> 00:55:46,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

599
00:55:46,694 --> 00:55:50,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna try and squeeze in that last policy.

600
00:55:51,196 --> 00:55:53,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other recommended changes?

601
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:55,538
[SPEAKER_00]: comments.

602
00:55:56,399 --> 00:55:57,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to approve.

603
00:56:00,141 --> 00:56:00,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

604
00:56:02,302 --> 00:56:05,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Member and that that will include, um.

605
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:13,747
[SPEAKER_00]: And annual report to be performed and, um and, um.

606
00:56:14,468 --> 00:56:17,089
[SPEAKER_00]: That the superintendent will create some kind of methodology.

607
00:56:17,129 --> 00:56:18,010
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add that sentence.

608
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,651
[SPEAKER_00]: We can always amend it when we get to the full committee.

609
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,372
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think I bungled the

610
00:56:25,267 --> 00:56:25,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

611
00:56:26,528 --> 00:56:27,368
[SPEAKER_00]: And member McLaughlin?

612
00:56:27,629 --> 00:56:27,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

613
00:56:28,669 --> 00:56:29,550
[SPEAKER_00]: And member Rossell, yes.

614
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Three in the affirmative.

615
00:56:31,111 --> 00:56:35,634
[SPEAKER_00]: The policy will be sent to the full school committee as amended.

616
00:56:36,274 --> 00:56:45,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, okay, this is just a, oh, sorry.

617
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.

618
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:48,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Gifts to and solicitations by staff.

619
00:56:48,402 --> 00:56:52,785
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I don't believe, let me expand the size of this some.

620
00:56:54,513 --> 00:57:03,039
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I had to write an awful lot of policies and update a lot of policies this weekend.

621
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,962
[SPEAKER_00]: So forgive me for trying to get my head on about which one this is.

622
00:57:07,062 --> 00:57:14,068
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is taken from another, I believe an MASC policy.

623
00:57:14,088 --> 00:57:14,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

624
00:57:14,668 --> 00:57:15,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the December.

625
00:57:15,749 --> 00:57:20,512
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually one that we probably should have updated a very long time ago.

626
00:57:20,532 --> 00:57:23,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, is this new?

627
00:57:24,683 --> 00:57:29,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I. Is there any questions or comments?

628
00:57:42,817 --> 00:57:43,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to report.

629
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:43,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Quiet.

630
00:57:44,478 --> 00:57:46,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all really want to make me look good on time.

631
00:57:48,301 --> 00:57:49,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a second?

632
00:57:50,077 --> 00:57:52,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sorry, I was just finishing reading.

633
00:57:52,379 --> 00:57:53,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed this one.

634
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:54,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm sorry.

635
00:57:55,061 --> 00:57:56,022
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's okay, I'm done.

636
00:57:56,883 --> 00:58:02,447
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scrolling all over the place for anybody who's actually just trying to read it on screen, my apologies.

637
00:58:02,948 --> 00:58:08,732
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I mean, just for anybody that's interested, this is actually stuff coming right out of the law.

638
00:58:08,772 --> 00:58:13,236
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like, I don't think we have much wiggle room on any of this stuff.

639
00:58:13,496 --> 00:58:18,800
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's totally pulled right from our annual ethics course that we have to take.

640
00:58:20,532 --> 00:58:33,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to interrupt, but I think going to Member Graham's point, if you scroll down, it basically covers that any gifts to the teachers are gifts for school use.

641
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:38,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So it seems that gifts for school use, that rug that you mentioned as one example,

642
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:46,549
[SPEAKER_04]: then that section then covers that it's solely for the classroom.

643
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:50,590
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would seem that it remains with the district.

644
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:54,651
[SPEAKER_04]: But it may be something that you wanna clarify in the future.

645
00:58:58,712 --> 00:59:06,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think, I guess in my mind, any gifts to the teacher outside of say maybe like a $5 gift card for Starbucks or something along,

646
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:14,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Any gifts to the teacher are to enhance and improve the instructional opportunities and academic outcomes for the students of Medford.

647
00:59:15,536 --> 00:59:23,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, they should remain with the students of Medford if a teacher decides to move forward elsewhere.

648
00:59:26,824 --> 00:59:28,305
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

649
00:59:28,325 --> 00:59:29,806
[SPEAKER_00]: That definitely is how I understand it.

650
00:59:30,187 --> 00:59:32,989
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is version one.

651
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:36,311
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we all feel like we need to make some

652
00:59:36,919 --> 00:59:37,739
[SPEAKER_00]: additional changes.

653
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:39,920
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to bring it back here, of course.

654
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,141
[SPEAKER_00]: So I heard a motion to approve and second.

655
00:59:45,102 --> 00:59:46,902
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin, did you have another comment?

656
00:59:46,942 --> 00:59:47,382
[SPEAKER_00]: No, okay.

657
00:59:48,523 --> 00:59:49,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham.

658
00:59:49,883 --> 00:59:50,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

659
00:59:51,523 --> 00:59:52,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin.

660
00:59:52,644 --> 00:59:52,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

661
00:59:54,844 --> 00:59:55,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Ruseau, yes.

662
00:59:55,845 --> 00:59:56,965
[SPEAKER_00]: That's three in the affirmative.

663
00:59:56,985 --> 00:59:59,986
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be sent up to the full school committee.

664
01:00:01,787 --> 01:00:01,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

665
01:00:02,067 --> 01:00:02,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Weiss.

666
01:00:03,447 --> 01:00:06,288
[SPEAKER_00]: I see your hand up again, and I think you had a question.

667
01:00:12,344 --> 01:00:36,037
[SPEAKER_01]: I was typing, and I apologize if I missed this, but the policy on the agenda, this is regarding the one about foster care, because I guess our previous policy, JFABE, students who move in the middle of the year, also included foster care, but DESE wants a

668
01:00:36,994 --> 01:00:43,557
[SPEAKER_01]: its own policy on foster care, so that was why I had put the mask one into that folder.

669
01:00:45,118 --> 01:00:50,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't know if we could, I can't make a motion, but if you would consider that.

670
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:53,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, let me just bring it up.

671
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:59,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And I read that one, I didn't have any questions about it.

672
01:01:01,646 --> 01:01:04,708
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have a number, a policy ID?

673
01:01:05,478 --> 01:01:07,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hang on a second.

674
01:01:07,819 --> 01:01:13,021
[SPEAKER_01]: It says J F A B F. Ah, All right.

675
01:01:13,601 --> 01:01:14,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yes.

676
01:01:16,082 --> 01:01:18,682
[SPEAKER_00]: The F and the E probably confused me at some point.

677
01:01:19,063 --> 01:01:20,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Okay.

678
01:01:20,903 --> 01:01:24,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and let me just bring up to see if we already have one of any sort.

679
01:01:25,945 --> 01:01:27,946
[SPEAKER_05]: It's at the top of your box member result.

680
01:01:33,487 --> 01:01:34,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Which box this one?

681
01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:43,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I shared the JFABF with you, the children in foster care document with you.

682
01:01:45,516 --> 01:01:46,337
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

683
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:48,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, when did you share it?

684
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:49,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Just right now.

685
01:01:49,339 --> 01:01:50,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I just shared it with you.

686
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:54,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it's showing at the top of your... Oh, no, because I'm sharing my screen.

687
01:01:54,723 --> 01:01:56,465
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot see almost anything.

688
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:58,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see chat.

689
01:01:58,987 --> 01:01:59,027
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

690
01:02:06,552 --> 01:02:10,813
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just, I can pull this up probably quicker than figuring out what Zoom is doing to me.

691
01:02:14,413 --> 01:02:17,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we don't even have this policy at all right now.

692
01:02:19,794 --> 01:02:21,495
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes this a lot quicker and easier.

693
01:02:22,755 --> 01:02:29,716
[SPEAKER_00]: So did the other members have a chance to look at this in the folder?

694
01:02:29,736 --> 01:02:31,956
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not.

695
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:35,517
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the two of you have, that's two out of three and that's good enough for me.

696
01:02:37,878 --> 01:02:42,760
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take this text and make it into a pretty Google Doc like the others.

697
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:47,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this one is definitely urgently needed for that audit as well.

698
01:02:49,803 --> 01:02:57,486
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm comfortable with taking the version that MASC has.

699
01:02:59,486 --> 01:03:02,448
[SPEAKER_00]: They would of course not reference like a particular school district.

700
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:05,389
[SPEAKER_00]: So that won't actually pose any editing challenges.

701
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:06,569
[SPEAKER_00]: this.

702
01:03:06,709 --> 01:03:09,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody want to motion to accept this policy?

703
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:11,810
[SPEAKER_00]: As it is written.

704
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to approve.

705
01:03:14,951 --> 01:03:15,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin.

706
01:03:17,151 --> 01:03:18,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll second.

707
01:03:18,511 --> 01:03:20,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let me just ask a question first.

708
01:03:20,491 --> 01:03:27,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Um so just again for the viewers, um, two things one when you're talking about the audit, would you mind sharing what that is?

709
01:03:27,933 --> 01:03:30,533
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other is for folks, um,

710
01:03:35,708 --> 01:03:44,838
[SPEAKER_03]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, Moderator): I'm the original is all on the website and most of which was procured from the mass association of school committees regarding policy that

711
01:03:45,347 --> 01:03:49,629
[SPEAKER_03]: we have currently existing and for the ones that we're changing, right?

712
01:03:49,709 --> 01:04:14,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, sometimes I feel like we, sometimes I just feel like we get ahead of ourselves and don't, I know it's the end of the meeting, but maybe next time, even for the beginning of the meeting, we can just sort of give a little bit of a lay the groundwork or for lay people that are out there that where this is coming from, because it's occurring to me now when people are looking at the JFABF and the MASC and things like that, that people might be wondering what the heck this is and where it's coming from.

713
01:04:15,482 --> 01:04:16,703
[SPEAKER_03]: just a little orientation.

714
01:04:17,043 --> 01:04:24,048
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm okay with moving this forward since it is from the Mass Association of School Committees and is recommended by them for their policy.

715
01:04:24,088 --> 01:04:30,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if there are things that need to be changed, as you said, this is the first pass and can be changed on the floor of school committee as well.

716
01:04:31,433 --> 01:04:32,134
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you.

717
01:04:33,075 --> 01:04:34,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

718
01:04:34,736 --> 01:04:40,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also, your point about sort of orienting the public.

719
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,823
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that actually including a link in the agenda

720
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:47,000
[SPEAKER_00]: that references the old policy.

721
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,501
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click it and go right to it.

722
01:04:48,981 --> 01:04:51,662
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new recommended policy, you can click and go right to it.

723
01:04:52,062 --> 01:04:55,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally reasonable to do and include in our agendas going forward.

724
01:04:55,923 --> 01:05:00,084
[SPEAKER_00]: It does sort of require that the work is done early enough to be able to do that.

725
01:05:00,224 --> 01:05:07,006
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly the existing policies are obviously going to be available before a posting.

726
01:05:07,126 --> 01:05:12,048
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate that feedback and I know I'll work to do that.

727
01:05:12,148 --> 01:05:12,848
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin.

728
01:05:13,482 --> 01:05:13,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

729
01:05:13,922 --> 01:05:15,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And can you just clarify the audit?

730
01:05:15,503 --> 01:05:17,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you talking about coordinated program?

731
01:05:17,364 --> 01:05:20,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not called that anymore, but what is the audit that you're referring to?

732
01:05:21,686 --> 01:05:23,628
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to let somebody else who knows answer.

733
01:05:23,688 --> 01:05:28,930
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe it's the tiered focus monitoring.

734
01:05:29,711 --> 01:05:39,556
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, did the Department of Education does an annual audit with our school district on tiered monitoring, right?

735
01:05:39,816 --> 01:05:42,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And tiered systems of support you're talking about?

736
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:45,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, can you elaborate, Dr. Cashew, just for a moment?

737
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:47,411
[SPEAKER_01]: I can read.

738
01:05:47,811 --> 01:05:50,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Diane Caldwell's been working on this.

739
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:56,438
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't necessarily that Medford's done anything wrong, but I can read the descriptor.

740
01:05:56,458 --> 01:06:02,684
[SPEAKER_01]: It says DESE is conducting an educational stability program review of all districts.

741
01:06:03,304 --> 01:06:11,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is part of the first 60 to be evaluated, and DESE would like all districts to adopt policies

742
01:06:11,579 --> 01:06:15,161
[SPEAKER_01]: for military foster care and homeless that are ESSA compliant.

743
01:06:16,022 --> 01:06:20,404
[SPEAKER_01]: They suggest we use the policies from MASC dated October 2019.

744
01:06:20,504 --> 01:06:23,106
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

745
01:06:23,186 --> 01:06:27,428
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, for ESSA, for folks who are listening, that's the Every Student Succeeds Act.

746
01:06:27,588 --> 01:06:32,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's a federal act that we're required to be compliant with.

747
01:06:33,334 --> 01:06:33,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

748
01:06:33,734 --> 01:06:47,324
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll just try to remember when we do the acronyms, I'll just be calling out just so again, nothing personal to anybody else, but more so having gone to graduate school just a couple of years ago and feeling like everybody was speaking a foreign language.

749
01:06:47,384 --> 01:06:54,089
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to remember just when we're talking tiered systems and ESSA and MASC and we could go on and on.

750
01:06:54,129 --> 01:06:58,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I think somebody needs to, I think Randy Rainbow needs to do a whole education acronym video.

751
01:07:00,473 --> 01:07:01,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love that.

752
01:07:02,298 --> 01:07:02,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.

753
01:07:02,898 --> 01:07:07,180
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so on the motion to approve, member Graham?

754
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:09,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, yes.

755
01:07:11,022 --> 01:07:11,742
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin?

756
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:13,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

757
01:07:14,043 --> 01:07:14,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Ruseau, yes.

758
01:07:15,203 --> 01:07:17,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Cushing, did you have your hand up?

759
01:07:17,284 --> 01:07:17,684
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.

760
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:18,765
No.

761
01:07:19,565 --> 01:07:20,105
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, thank you.

762
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:22,686
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's three in the affirmative.

763
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:26,228
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll send this policy up once I put it into a format that I can stand.

764
01:07:26,448 --> 01:07:31,750
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do dislike the plain text format of our policy service.

765
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:35,056
[SPEAKER_00]: And that concludes our meeting.

766
01:07:35,116 --> 01:07:36,860
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for running over nine minutes.

767
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

768
01:07:38,182 --> 01:07:39,745
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

769
01:07:39,965 --> 01:07:43,031
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Graham, motion to adjourn?

770
01:07:43,051 --> 01:07:45,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

771
01:07:45,876 --> 01:07:48,461
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm asking if you... Oh, yes.

772
01:07:49,002 --> 01:07:49,783
Yes, okay.

773
01:07:50,064 --> 01:07:50,805
[SPEAKER_00]: Member McLaughlin?

774
01:07:51,066 --> 01:07:51,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

775
01:07:52,047 --> 01:07:53,791
[SPEAKER_00]: Member Rossell, yes, three in the affirmative.

776
01:07:53,851 --> 01:07:54,732
[SPEAKER_00]: This meeting is adjourned.

777
01:07:54,752 --> 01:07:55,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
