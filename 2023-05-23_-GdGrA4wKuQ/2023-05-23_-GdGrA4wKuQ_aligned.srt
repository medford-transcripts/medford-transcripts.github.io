11
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:35,759
So,

12
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:58,116
I just literally a couple of minutes ago sent the other subcommittee members, shared with them the folder I've created with all of the member evaluations.

13
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,578
Member Hayes, do you want to call the roll first?

14
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,360
Oh, I apologize.

15
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:03,660
Yes.

16
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,360
That's OK.

17
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,181
Thank you for reminding me.

18
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:08,443
I will call the roll.

19
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:09,103
Member Graham?

20
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:09,944
Here.

21
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,705
Member McLaughlin?

22
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:18,883
McLaughlin.

23
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:22,985
Can't hear you.

24
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:25,527
You're clearly here, though.

25
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,191
Can you hear me now?

26
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:31,951
Yes.

27
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:33,072
Okay, good here.

28
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,414
And member Hayes is present.

29
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:38,996
All members are present so we can begin.

30
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:44,720
So I just like I said, I was beginning to say I shared

31
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:50,424
moments before the meeting started or probably maybe even a moment as it started.

32
00:02:51,945 --> 00:03:03,928
So I began creating the composite just in terms of putting the ratings, which I will share with you guys.

33
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:10,890
I have not had a chance to compile all of the comments because I don't think

34
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:22,650
I gave myself enough time, I think we probably should have planned a couple of days between the due date and the meeting, because all of the, all of them came in, except membercrats, all of them came in yesterday.

35
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:32,994
So let me see if I can bring up the, nope, that's not the right, hold on.

36
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:34,475
Give me just a second.

37
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:58,257
Okay, let me see if I can share this.

38
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:07,764
Hold on just a second.

39
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:19,898
All right, I'm having technical difficulties.

40
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:29,644
Do you want me to share it?

41
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:31,185
Is it something you emailed us?

42
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:37,009
It's in the shared folder if you're able to open the Google Drive.

43
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:37,889
OK.

44
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,791
It should have been shared with you.

45
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,712
Hold on.

46
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:43,473
Let me see if I can.

47
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:56,257
I apologize.

48
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:56,897
That's OK.

49
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:57,918
And so it's right here.

50
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:03,400
What do you want, the PDF, 2023 evaluation PDF, or what are you looking for?

51
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,362
There should be one that's labeled composite, or there is one that's labeled composite.

52
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:10,562
OK.

53
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:17,105
I'm just not seeing how to share.

54
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,146
That's OK.

55
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:20,186
I can do it.

56
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:21,006
You mean on the Zoom?

57
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:22,687
Yeah.

58
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,972
Uh, it's just on the it should be on your right on your I mean on the bottom menu bar.

59
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:35,876
So evaluations of committee notes, notes version 2 version 3 Superintendent evaluation guide.

60
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:36,696
Oh, last modified.

61
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:37,276
Let me do that.

62
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:40,298
Last modified.

63
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:54,755
So tell me what it's called.

64
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:55,495
Do you remember?

65
00:05:55,515 --> 00:06:05,763
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:08,746
I'm getting help right now with that one.

67
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,630
Yeah, it's not coming up unshared with me.

68
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,074
There it is.

69
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:19,975
Is that coming up?

70
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:20,155
OK.

71
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:34,377
OK, so what I was able to do so far is compile the ratings and fill them in.

72
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:53,973
We created a composite form where we could put, instead of the checkboxes, we could put in the numbers of each rating so we could see how they kind of fell out in terms of understanding what the final composite rating

73
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,990
rating scores, for lack of a better word, would be.

74
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:12,958
So as we can see, this first page, the goals, the professional practice goals, there was one significant, five said met and one said exceeded.

75
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:20,002
Student learning was one, some progress, one significant, four met, one exceeded.

76
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:23,304
District improvement goals,

77
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:27,984
three significant progress, three met, and one exceeded.

78
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:34,986
So anyone can jump in at some point if they want to add anything.

79
00:07:35,026 --> 00:07:42,269
I mean, I think we can see they pretty much fall out in terms of what the combined scores would be.

80
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:47,911
They're pretty much all in that met when you look at the preponderance of scores.

81
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:51,972
Of course, the five is certainly the professional practice goal.

82
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:57,197
the student learning goal, the four and the 18.

83
00:07:57,597 --> 00:07:57,777
Yep.

84
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:00,498
I was just going to say, I think this is really helpful.

85
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:07,520
And I, you know, especially having the numbers being able to add up instead of trying to, you know, nuance a whole bunch of other things.

86
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:13,322
So it looks like the, so the access toward progress goals and the assessed performance on standard.

87
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:13,682
Okay.

88
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:18,744
So, so the access towards goals, which we can see, you know, so,

89
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:21,675
Obviously, the numbers speak for themselves.

90
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:28,238
So, you know, some progress and significant progress, or some significant progress and met.

91
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:33,521
And then the step two, it looks like the numbers are in the proficient.

92
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:39,964
I know that you said you're going to marry the comments from the evaluators.

93
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:40,284
So.

94
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:42,465
Yeah, I'm going to, I'm sorry.

95
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:44,446
Yeah, I'm going to put them together in a document.

96
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:49,249
That was my plan was to have that ready for today, but they were just, it was, I didn't have enough time.

97
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:51,238
No, I think you've done a great job.

98
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,619
Thank you for all that you have done.

99
00:08:52,659 --> 00:09:05,226
And I think this particular rubric and sort of seeing the visual again, I'm a visual learner, as I've said before, I think seeing the visual with the numbers and the standards is really helpful for me.

100
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:07,687
So I appreciate that.

101
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:15,091
And so the way that the numbers look, and again, we will talk about this in the larger

102
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:16,935
committee meeting.

103
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:23,360
But if I understand correctly, the way the numbers are coming out now is a is proficient.

104
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,083
Pretty much across the board.

105
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:27,403
Yeah.

106
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:30,566
When you look at that and we can scroll down through the rest of them, too.

107
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:35,670
But well, these are the these are the three the three main areas.

108
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:36,791
Right.

109
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:41,475
These are the three where we all had to take all of our scores and and

110
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:43,634
Yeah.

111
00:09:43,694 --> 00:09:46,356
And we'll see that later on page three or whatever.

112
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:46,456
Yeah.

113
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:46,976
Correct.

114
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:49,237
I thought your instructions were very helpful as well.

115
00:09:49,838 --> 00:10:00,844
So essentially what you had said to us was go to page three, do your individual assessments based on what you think.

116
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:12,390
And then you're taking those individual assessments and assigning the number of significant progress met or exceeded based on various committee members input.

117
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:17,271
and then the same with the standards that we all agreed upon.

118
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:18,832
Yes, thank you.

119
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,774
Thank you, that was a good way to summarize it.

120
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,956
No, I think it's been super helpful.

121
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:28,161
And then I think that obviously there'll be some, so that's the quantitative data.

122
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,153
Right, and there'll be some qualitative data that will be brought to the table at the next.

123
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:37,995
Um, school committee meeting, um, when we.

124
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:40,257
When we share this out, is that right?

125
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:47,521
Uh, in terms of the comments from members, yes, we can either I mean, we can either work on that.

126
00:10:49,130 --> 00:11:16,693
here or here if we can get them to all together into a document or we can we do have another subcommittee meeting scheduled where we could look at that and I think what we had said as part of the process was that the subcommittee would would put selected comments in to kind of represent the ratings that we would select comments from the various members evaluations and

127
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:23,583
create the composite, including the comments to bring to the whole committee.

128
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:26,586
So may I?

129
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:27,487
Sure.

130
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:28,489
Thank you.

131
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:37,839
So would it be helpful to have all of the narrative in one like, you know, Google Doc or something that is shared?

132
00:11:39,799 --> 00:12:03,178
individually with us where we cannot respond to each other, so that we're not violating any public meeting rules, where we could potentially highlight comments that we feel are representative of the whole, probably as like sort of homework before the next meeting?

133
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:05,180
Yeah, thank you.

134
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,782
That's a really good suggestion, because as I said,

135
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,932
I'd envisioned having it ready for this meeting and we could actually just do it together at this meeting.

136
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:27,399
But given that that, you know, the time frame didn't allow for that, maybe that's the best way to move forward is to create the finish creating that Google Doc, which I've already started, but just haven't been able to finish.

137
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,280
And like you said, I can share that with you and member Graham.

138
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:37,143
And when we meet on April 1st, I believe it is, we could probably have a pretty

139
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:42,399
efficient meeting in terms of choosing out the comments.

140
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,880
I think you mean June 1st, right?

141
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,101
I'm sorry, I keep saying April today for some reason.

142
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,041
Yes, June 1st.

143
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:49,741
Thank you.

144
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:52,582
That's fine.

145
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:53,402
Great.

146
00:12:54,463 --> 00:13:01,085
Do we want to scroll down and you can see some of the other, we can view some of the other scores just so people have an idea of

147
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:05,018
where some of these fell out.

148
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:20,607
These are the specific, the superintendent's specific goals, early literacy, her professional practice goal, and her three district improvement goals.

149
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:28,212
And feel free to ask any questions.

150
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:32,615
I mean, this is really just, I just pulled the data straight out from everyone's

151
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:34,605
individual evaluations.

152
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:41,012
And you can see it really all does fall kind of in that middle, the met range.

153
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:50,804
And then these are the individual standards and the indicators of how people vote rated on the indicators.

154
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,387
Standard one instructional leadership.

155
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:06,440
Standard two, management and operations, there was just one indicator chosen.

156
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:18,043
And there's standard three, family and community engagement.

157
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:27,605
And then finally,

158
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,041
standard for professional culture.

159
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:57,420
So I guess from here do we need to make a motion that will that that would be the next step would be that I'll send um create the combined uh the document of combined comments and uh

160
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:04,988
We'll meet next time and go through those to fill in the comment sections of the composite.

161
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:07,469
Member Graham?

162
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,010
I see your hand up.

163
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,053
Member Graham, did you want to say something?

164
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:32,633
Oh, she just texted me that she can't be unmuted.

165
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:33,555
She can't unmute.

166
00:15:33,896 --> 00:15:34,157
Oh, okay.

167
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:35,542
Let me, let me see what I can do.

168
00:16:03,482 --> 00:16:04,302
Hi, can you hear me?

169
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:05,322
Yes.

170
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:06,043
Okay.

171
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:14,305
I can't turn on my camera for reasons I don't understand, but I just didn't want you to think I was sitting here not paying attention.

172
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:19,046
I am totally fine with that approach.

173
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:21,487
Okay.

174
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:26,148
So do we, I don't know, do we need to vote on that or is that more formal than we need to?

175
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:30,369
I don't think you need a motion, but what do you think?

176
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:32,736
I don't think so.

177
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:34,576
Yeah, I don't think so.

178
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:37,737
We have two meetings scheduled to do this work.

179
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:40,758
So yeah, that's just really a continuation.

180
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:49,119
We might just at the end of the meeting, instead of motioning to adjourn, we might just motion to continue the meeting.

181
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,980
I think that's the table motion to table to the next meeting.

182
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,801
But the close out of the meeting, I think we call it something different.

183
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:57,281
Hold on.

184
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:23,522
Yeah, and to be clear if people are wondering, like again that are watching or whatever if they're wondering why we're not discussing, you know, the, the ratings themselves that's not the purpose of the meeting this meeting is really to as a, as a, you know, the evaluation subcommittee to really

185
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,589
work on the process, right?

186
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:28,970
Member Hayes.

187
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,830
Correct, yeah.

188
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:38,213
And so it would, instead of being a motion to adjourn, it would be a motion to continue the meeting on June 1st.

189
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:40,974
OK.

190
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:45,235
Well, does anyone have anything else to add about this?

191
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:50,296
I guess at this point, the data is in.

192
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:55,478
It really is just that question of adding in the comments.

193
00:17:56,592 --> 00:18:01,335
Can we get a timeline member Hayes, excuse me, may I speak, please.

194
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:01,595
Sorry.

195
00:18:01,635 --> 00:18:02,255
Yes, of course.

196
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:17,784
Can we get a timeline on when you want to get the qualitative material to us and when you'd like us to get back to you with the highlighted material before the next meeting that would be helpful just to put it in my calendar.

197
00:18:20,091 --> 00:18:21,711
Well, I will be getting that to you.

198
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:29,453
I mean, I'll be getting the finishing, completing the Google Doc that's already in the, it's in the shared folder I already sent you.

199
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:42,496
I don't know that, I think that actually the next meeting is for us to together create the, decide upon the comments to go in the comment section.

200
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:45,456
So I'm not really sure there's any, I don't think there's anything you need to send to me.

201
00:18:45,476 --> 00:18:45,976
Oh yeah, that's right.

202
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:46,996
We're not getting them back to you.

203
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:49,177
We're just highlighting the homework in the meantime, right?

204
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:49,557
Thank you.

205
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,961
Oh, I see a hand raised from Jess.

206
00:18:58,144 --> 00:18:58,544
I don't know.

207
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:01,266
Is Jess able to unmute, or is she?

208
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:03,427
Hi.

209
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:05,108
Can you hear me?

210
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:07,410
Yes.

211
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,470
Hi.

212
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,191
I just had a quick question.

213
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:19,697
Do you ask parents or teachers anything for this, or is it just the school committee that does the grading for the performance?

214
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:23,220
This is a school committee process.

215
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,884
The school committee is responsible for evaluating the superintendent.

216
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,626
Oh, okay.

217
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:30,947
Thank you.

218
00:19:30,987 --> 00:19:31,948
I just wasn't sure.

219
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:32,528
Thank you.

220
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:33,349
You're welcome.

221
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:40,876
I don't know if anyone had anything to add to that, if there was anything I missed about community input.

222
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:45,119
In terms of actual writing of the,

223
00:19:46,431 --> 00:20:03,779
the superintendent evaluation, that is our responsibility in terms of community input, that would probably be more through any evidence that the superintendent provides for us of community input on any of the areas that she's being evaluated on.

224
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:06,620
Is that correct to say, yes?

225
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:08,213
Yeah, yeah, you're correct.

226
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:15,937
I think I would just add to that, that this is a legal requirement for school committees.

227
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:21,479
It's one of the three responsibilities that are set out under the law for school committees.

228
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,562
School committees do have, just for your information, some latitude in terms of

229
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:28,943
what process they establish.

230
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:45,347
And your point is well taken that perhaps in the future, we should think about a public input part of the process, because I think that's important to all of us.

231
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,868
So just more to say,

232
00:20:49,048 --> 00:21:06,334
The process is laid out and how we submit the results is very defined, but we do have the latitude to outline the process itself that leads to that kind of standardized reporting to DESE that we have conducted this review.

233
00:21:06,694 --> 00:21:08,695
So there is some latitude there, and I do think

234
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:27,884
Jess's point is well taken, that we should think about that for future, which would require some set of activity, like before this meeting in particular, so that we could hear that input and have a process for how we might include that.

235
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:32,607
So I think just for your information, great suggestion, Jess.

236
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:32,988
And

237
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:34,969
we should think about that in the future.

238
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:43,732
I will also note that this is probably the earliest we've ever been able to have an organized process.

239
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:55,055
The last couple of years, we've made a lot of progress to doing this consistently and clearly, and this is just another step of progress, at least in the four years that I've been on the committee.

240
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:56,916
Thank you.

241
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:02,258
Yes, I think we're always looking for ways to improve the process and improve our ways of

242
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:06,448
getting information to evaluate.

243
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:14,689
So I think that as member Graham said, looking for a way to include the community in the process would certainly be a next step, a next goal for next year.

244
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:25,131
That being said, if there are any, not any other questions from either the committee or from any members of the public?

245
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,852
Member Hayes, I think somebody, Paul has his hand in the air, Paul Garrity.

246
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,001
Oh, thank you, I didn't see that.

247
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:40,527
I couldn't tell if you were clapping, Paul, or you had your hand up.

248
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:42,329
Yes, Mr. Garrity, go ahead.

249
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:46,793
I think he needs to be able to be unmuted.

250
00:22:47,153 --> 00:22:49,235
Okay, that's someone else.

251
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:52,337
Superintendent, are you able to unmute him?

252
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,080
Good evening, ladies.

253
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,881
Hi, thank you.

254
00:22:57,182 --> 00:22:58,222
My quick question is that,

255
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:11,927
When this report is finally shared with the public as a whole, will the metrics that were used by the individual reviewers also be made part of the presentation?

256
00:23:11,947 --> 00:23:16,229
In other words, there's columns with numbers and saying, this is our evaluation.

257
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:26,415
Will we have some kind of metrics that says what do the individual reviewers use to make that determination that resulted in a number for a particular category?

258
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:29,789
Sure, good question.

259
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:47,274
Well, we use the self-evaluation from the superintendent, where she gives us an update on, it's all based on the goals that the superintendent and the school committee discussed at the beginning of the year, the agreed upon goals and indicators.

260
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:56,057
And so the superintendent presented her self-evaluation two weeks ago, and that's the information that we use to

261
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:58,713
complete our evaluations.

262
00:23:59,713 --> 00:24:02,814
Does any other member have something more to add to that?

263
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:13,979
I would also just say that that self-evaluation also included various forms of evidence that support the narrative that was provided.

264
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,501
And so, for example, there were

265
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:29,831
scores from our map testing from last year and this year that were provided to us to provide evidence around the student learning goal, for example.

266
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:35,974
So there is both the superintendent's narrative and evidence that she provides.

267
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:39,356
And I think also, you know, just

268
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:49,865
sort of our own like point of view and experience over the course of the year as we have been thinking about this evaluation and our work on the school committee.

269
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:55,370
All of that is part of what goes into everyone's individual ratings and rankings.

270
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:56,911
Thank you.

271
00:24:57,611 --> 00:25:05,057
So was that uniform across the views, the individual views or the uniform or how do I, I know that they were uniform approach.

272
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:11,029
I'm not, can you further explain what the question is?

273
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:14,569
Well, I have three people sitting in a class and three people making an observation.

274
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:20,311
How do I know that we're utilizing the same reference points, the same metrics, the same key indicators?

275
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:22,591
That's what I'm trying to get a feel for.

276
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,612
I think the short answer is you don't.

277
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:30,613
There are seven individual members of the committee, all who

278
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:34,161
have different points of view.

279
00:25:34,562 --> 00:25:40,423
And this is the way that we start to coalesce to a single point of view that is our committee's view.

280
00:25:40,963 --> 00:25:43,784
So we all obviously are looking at the same evidence.

281
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:55,487
We may see that evidence differently because we may have had different deeper discussions and been working on things, you know, outside of committee meetings and

282
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:56,607
and what have you.

283
00:25:56,707 --> 00:26:02,348
So the first step is for the committee to say individually and independently, this is how we are feeling.

284
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:14,750
And then the ultimate product here is the review that represents the committee's view by a majority vote.

285
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:24,432
So the recognition is that individuals are going to have their own perspective, and that's the starting point to coalesce to the review that gets approved.

286
00:26:27,642 --> 00:26:28,042
Thank you.

287
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:50,071
Yeah, I just wanted to add that I think what I'm hearing too is that, you know, the evidence that's there and we are, that's part of the process that we're going through now in terms of making this process uniform using the rubric that DESI provides around evaluation, identifying in advance what the goals are, what goals and items are being evaluated,

288
00:26:50,571 --> 00:27:01,450
And that we're using this specific rubric to do this which has not been the case in the past so that's all publicly available information that's all part of what you see here in the in the.

289
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:19,985
in the material that we just shared, but also, you know, DESE has their superintendent rubric online, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and was one of the reasons that we really wanted to standardize the form and use what other people are using so that we're comparing apples to apples across districts and amongst each other.

290
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:25,106
And then the other piece I think I heard you say was that, would you know what individuals reported?

291
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:27,946
And yes, that's part of public information.

292
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:31,407
And we are also sharing that as part of

293
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:42,530
a vote that we took earlier that each of our reports are, you know, they're public anyway, but that we would all, you know, essentially be able to see or have that information that we saw individually.

294
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:53,872
But this subcommittee is tasked with bringing all that information together under member Hayes' stewardship and direction to bring all the information together.

295
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:56,893
And so that's part of why we're looking at the, you know, quantitative data.

296
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:59,934
The numbers are a little bit easier to just sort of put together.

297
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:01,174
The qualitative data can be

298
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:14,978
a little bit more time-consuming because we might have seven, you know, well, we will have seven narratives, but I suspect that a lot of them will be similar and some of them may be dissimilar, and that's sort of what we'll be charted with.

299
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:26,642
And then I just, if I might, Member Hayes, I wanted to also address the question from Jess, who, I don't know Jess's last name, but sorry, Jess, that we didn't get the name for the record, but

300
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:33,988
to just share that part of the superintendent evaluation process should be happening throughout the year, right?

301
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:38,413
I mean we're all hearing from constituents as school committee members about what

302
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:52,515
their experiences are in the district what they would like to see changed or better or improved what they think is working, you know how things are sort of happening so we're seeing that throughout the year we definitely have public participation throughout the year as well.

303
00:28:53,055 --> 00:29:00,141
I think it's a longer conversation for the entire committee to have around, you know how and in what way.

304
00:29:01,422 --> 00:29:09,745
there'd be public participation in superintendent evaluation and also looking at what other districts are doing and what the protocol is and sort of all of those things.

305
00:29:09,825 --> 00:29:18,048
And because it can also, as you can imagine, the people that show up might be the squeaky wheels and the people that don't might not be.

306
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:28,492
So there sort of has to be a process that we all agree is equitable and is one that is consistent and one that the MASC, which is the Mass Association of School Committees,

307
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:37,874
and the MASS, which is the Mass Association of School Superintendents, would surely offer advice and let us know best practices around doing that as well.

308
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:41,514
So I think that there's always opportunity for feedback.

309
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:45,715
So I hope that you guys are reaching out to us to let us know.

310
00:29:45,755 --> 00:29:50,676
And also, I know that the superintendent has been receptive as well in terms of people reaching out to her.

311
00:29:50,736 --> 00:29:52,076
So I would encourage that too.

312
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:58,457
And that's part of the building relationships that we should all be working on in terms of the family and community engagement.

313
00:29:59,017 --> 00:30:01,680
So I just I just sort of wanted to mention that as well.

314
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:10,488
Again, my concern consistency review and that the key indicators are shared universally across all members when they make their determinations.

315
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:11,069
Thank you.

316
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:11,709
Absolutely.

317
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:12,130
Thank you.

318
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,653
Yep, it is as part of the data that's that's if I may member pays I'm sorry.

319
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:16,314
Sure.

320
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:19,749
Absolutely, that's why we're going with a rubric.

321
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:21,190
So thank you, you're absolutely right.

322
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,572
It's shared with all the members across the board, same rubric.

323
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:31,057
We're all evaluating based on the items we agreed to evaluate based on the superintendent's goal.

324
00:30:31,077 --> 00:30:32,758
So we are making it much more uniform.

325
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:35,780
Thank you for asking and for noticing.

326
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,981
Thank you.

327
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:45,627
And I would just add, I think that at our meeting, when we present this to the entire committee for them to vote on the final composite,

328
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:54,705
I think at that point, we will talk as a committee about how exactly we want to share this, what's the best way to share this so that everyone has access to it.

329
00:30:55,245 --> 00:31:10,333
We've talked about a couple of different ways of possibly putting it on the website and making sure that everyone has access to both the composite, but also our individual evaluations.

330
00:31:10,353 --> 00:31:15,716
Because as both member Graham and member McLaughlin have said, it's all public information.

331
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:20,544
Desi doesn't specify how we share it or how we make it public.

332
00:31:21,664 --> 00:31:23,725
So that's really up to us to make that decision.

333
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:33,508
And I've looked around at other districts and it's remarkably difficult actually to find in many districts to find the superintendent evaluation.

334
00:31:33,588 --> 00:31:41,830
So it's really kind of up to us to create that process and decide how we wanna share it and create that access for the community.

335
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,151
I would just offer in closing that it's,

336
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:54,920
to educate the citizenry in terms of what were the key indicators that were being observed and that they were universally applied across the board.

337
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,023
It would be very helpful if that was explained during the entire presentation.

338
00:31:58,143 --> 00:31:58,423
Thank you.

339
00:31:59,713 --> 00:31:59,953
Sure.

340
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:00,654
Thank you very much.

341
00:32:01,114 --> 00:32:12,660
Member Hayes, if I might, I just also want to express that this is the literal only place I've ever seen somebody's performance review be aired in public.

342
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,741
I think it's incredibly awkward.

343
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:27,829
I think it's a problematic process for many, many, many reasons, which is probably why you don't see too many districts sort of blasting this information on their website.

344
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:32,375
At the end of the day, Dr Edward Vincent is our employee.

345
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:38,283
And so we also have to be mindful that there are lots of employment laws at play.

346
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:39,685
And we need to.

347
00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:42,950
So we need to take care I think Mr Gary to.

348
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:57,684
to sort of balance the fact that this is all public information and the fact that the superintendent is our employee and she does have rights as an employee of the district.

349
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:59,526
So that's the sticky part.

350
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:05,171
I agree with that, but I think we take it to a higher level and I agree with that, but I think we take it to the higher level.

351
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:06,212
These are the goals.

352
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:08,694
These are the metrics to see if the goals were achieved.

353
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:16,795
And how did people on the reviewing committee apply those metrics to the goals that were stated is fair enough approach.

354
00:33:17,756 --> 00:33:18,016
Yeah.

355
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:19,477
And we can certainly do that.

356
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:30,865
I mean, all the, the, um, the measures that were selected were selected in open meeting, but, um, maybe there's like a summary slide member Hayes or something that can be put together to say, this was, this was the focus for this year.

357
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:38,190
Um, I think the program overall is what's important to make the judgment on, but it contributes their parts to it.

358
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:42,984
I think it's also important, which is also publicly available.

359
00:33:43,364 --> 00:33:51,328
Again, the superintendent's goals for the year that are posted, and they're also goals that are shared goals.

360
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:55,830
We work on them together, the superintendent and the school committee at the beginning of the year.

361
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:04,834
So that's really where the, I don't know if the metrics so much, but the decisions about what are the particular focus areas.

362
00:34:05,372 --> 00:34:10,754
that is done, again, in open meeting, and it's also a document that's on the website that everyone can look at.

363
00:34:11,874 --> 00:34:12,055
Right.

364
00:34:12,075 --> 00:34:13,115
I had the original draft.

365
00:34:13,195 --> 00:34:14,235
I review it quite often.

366
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:16,456
Thank you.

367
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:17,136
Good.

368
00:34:17,997 --> 00:34:18,357
Thank you.

369
00:34:19,165 --> 00:34:20,326
Member McLaughlin, your hand's up.

370
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:21,446
Did you have something else to add?

371
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,007
I did.

372
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:35,434
I just wanted to say that I think it is good practice just as part of whenever we're, you know, orienting the community to what we're doing, you know, here's where we were, here's what we did, here's where we're going, here's what we're presenting, whatever.

373
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:39,176
So I think a primer slide or, you know, one or two, you know, here's

374
00:34:39,636 --> 00:34:56,042
The, you know, here are the goals here the, you know, pieces that we evaluated on and here's what the evaluation wants is always good sort of just again because not everybody is necessarily accessing the website, not everybody is necessarily, you know, coming to a public meeting or watching the meetings on MCM or

375
00:34:56,982 --> 00:34:57,443
what have you.

376
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:04,526
So I think it's just always good if people, you know, decide to tune in for that or if we have a record of the information is sort of this was what the process was.

377
00:35:04,606 --> 00:35:11,690
And so I think it could be really helpful to have a one-page, you know, piece and I'm happy to help work with you on that if you'd like.

378
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,471
That would be great because I am, oh sorry.

379
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:14,872
Go ahead.

380
00:35:15,372 --> 00:35:20,695
Just wanted to say, I'm still, as I said, I'm still working on some of the other pieces so it would be helpful if.

381
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:21,095
Yeah.

382
00:35:21,842 --> 00:35:24,785
someone maybe could pick up that piece of it, that creation of the slide.

383
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:26,967
Yeah, I'd be happy to do that.

384
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:28,668
And I think you did it really already.

385
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:34,554
I think you did the majority of the work already in the instructions.

386
00:35:34,874 --> 00:35:37,857
So I think it would just be a matter of simplifying that on a slide or two.

387
00:35:37,897 --> 00:35:40,820
I'm happy to do that and modify you guys at the next one.

388
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,040
Sure.

389
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:42,753
Wonderful, thanks so much.

390
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:53,455
Sure, so I would make an emotion that we continue the meeting to June 1st for our subcommittee meeting.

391
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:58,756
Second, I'll take a roll call vote then.

392
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:00,676
Member Graham?

393
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:01,617
Yes.

394
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:03,697
Member McLaughlin?

395
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:04,337
Yes.

396
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:05,797
Member Hayes?

397
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:06,158
Yes.

398
00:36:06,578 --> 00:36:08,618
Three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

399
00:36:09,518 --> 00:36:12,120
So this meeting is then, do we have to also adjourn?

400
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,621
Continued.

401
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:13,642
Nope, we're continued.

402
00:36:13,662 --> 00:36:15,523
Continued, sorry.

403
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:15,924
Thank you.

404
00:36:15,944 --> 00:36:17,305
Bye everyone, have a good day.

405
00:36:17,325 --> 00:36:18,046
Bye, thank you everyone.

406
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:18,386
Thank you.
