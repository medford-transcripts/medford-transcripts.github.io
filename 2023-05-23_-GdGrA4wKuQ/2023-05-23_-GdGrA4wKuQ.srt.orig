11
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:35,759
[SPEAKER_05]: So,

12
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:58,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I just literally a couple of minutes ago sent the other subcommittee members, shared with them the folder I've created with all of the member evaluations.

13
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:01,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hayes, do you want to call the roll first?

14
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I apologize.

15
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:03,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

16
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,360
[SPEAKER_05]: That's OK.

17
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,181
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for reminding me.

18
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:08,443
[SPEAKER_05]: I will call the roll.

19
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:09,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

20
00:02:09,684 --> 00:02:09,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Here.

21
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin?

22
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:18,883
[SPEAKER_03]: McLaughlin.

23
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:22,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't hear you.

24
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:25,527
[SPEAKER_03]: You're clearly here, though.

25
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me now?

26
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:31,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

27
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:33,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good here.

28
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And member Hayes is present.

29
00:02:37,235 --> 00:02:38,996
[SPEAKER_05]: All members are present so we can begin.

30
00:02:39,016 --> 00:02:44,720
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just like I said, I was beginning to say I shared

31
00:02:46,023 --> 00:02:50,424
[SPEAKER_05]: moments before the meeting started or probably maybe even a moment as it started.

32
00:02:51,945 --> 00:03:03,928
[SPEAKER_05]: So I began creating the composite just in terms of putting the ratings, which I will share with you guys.

33
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:10,890
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not had a chance to compile all of the comments because I don't think

34
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:22,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave myself enough time, I think we probably should have planned a couple of days between the due date and the meeting, because all of the, all of them came in, except membercrats, all of them came in yesterday.

35
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:32,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me see if I can bring up the, nope, that's not the right, hold on.

36
00:03:33,034 --> 00:03:34,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me just a second.

37
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:58,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let me see if I can share this.

38
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:07,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on just a second.

39
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:19,898
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'm having technical difficulties.

40
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:29,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want me to share it?

41
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:31,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it something you emailed us?

42
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:37,009
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the shared folder if you're able to open the Google Drive.

43
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:37,889
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

44
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,791
[SPEAKER_05]: It should have been shared with you.

45
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on.

46
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:43,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see if I can.

47
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:56,257
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

48
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:56,897
[SPEAKER_07]: That's OK.

49
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:57,918
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's right here.

50
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:03,400
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you want, the PDF, 2023 evaluation PDF, or what are you looking for?

51
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,362
[SPEAKER_05]: There should be one that's labeled composite, or there is one that's labeled composite.

52
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:10,562
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

53
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:17,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just not seeing how to share.

54
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,146
[SPEAKER_03]: That's OK.

55
00:05:19,306 --> 00:05:20,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do it.

56
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:21,006
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean on the Zoom?

57
00:05:22,387 --> 00:05:22,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

58
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, it's just on the it should be on your right on your I mean on the bottom menu bar.

59
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:35,876
[SPEAKER_07]: So evaluations of committee notes, notes version 2 version 3 Superintendent evaluation guide.

60
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:36,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, last modified.

61
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:37,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me do that.

62
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:40,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Last modified.

63
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:54,755
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell me what it's called.

64
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:55,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember?

65
00:05:55,515 --> 00:06:05,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

66
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:08,746
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting help right now with that one.

67
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not coming up unshared with me.

68
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,074
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

69
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:19,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that coming up?

70
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:20,155
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

71
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:34,377
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so what I was able to do so far is compile the ratings and fill them in.

72
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:53,973
[SPEAKER_05]: We created a composite form where we could put, instead of the checkboxes, we could put in the numbers of each rating so we could see how they kind of fell out in terms of understanding what the final composite rating

73
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,990
[SPEAKER_05]: rating scores, for lack of a better word, would be.

74
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:12,958
[SPEAKER_05]: So as we can see, this first page, the goals, the professional practice goals, there was one significant, five said met and one said exceeded.

75
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:20,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Student learning was one, some progress, one significant, four met, one exceeded.

76
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:23,304
[SPEAKER_05]: District improvement goals,

77
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:27,984
[SPEAKER_05]: three significant progress, three met, and one exceeded.

78
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:34,986
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyone can jump in at some point if they want to add anything.

79
00:07:35,026 --> 00:07:42,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think we can see they pretty much fall out in terms of what the combined scores would be.

80
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:47,911
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pretty much all in that met when you look at the preponderance of scores.

81
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:51,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the five is certainly the professional practice goal.

82
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:57,197
[SPEAKER_05]: the student learning goal, the four and the 18.

83
00:07:57,597 --> 00:07:57,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

84
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:00,498
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to say, I think this is really helpful.

85
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:07,520
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, you know, especially having the numbers being able to add up instead of trying to, you know, nuance a whole bunch of other things.

86
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:13,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like the, so the access toward progress goals and the assessed performance on standard.

87
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:13,682
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

88
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:18,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so the access towards goals, which we can see, you know, so,

89
00:08:20,154 --> 00:08:21,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, the numbers speak for themselves.

90
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:28,238
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, some progress and significant progress, or some significant progress and met.

91
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:33,521
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the step two, it looks like the numbers are in the proficient.

92
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:39,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that you said you're going to marry the comments from the evaluators.

93
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:40,284
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

94
00:08:40,304 --> 00:08:42,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm going to, I'm sorry.

95
00:08:42,505 --> 00:08:44,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm going to put them together in a document.

96
00:08:44,466 --> 00:08:49,249
[SPEAKER_05]: That was my plan was to have that ready for today, but they were just, it was, I didn't have enough time.

97
00:08:49,817 --> 00:08:51,238
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think you've done a great job.

98
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,619
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for all that you have done.

99
00:08:52,659 --> 00:09:05,226
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this particular rubric and sort of seeing the visual again, I'm a visual learner, as I've said before, I think seeing the visual with the numbers and the standards is really helpful for me.

100
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:07,687
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate that.

101
00:09:08,308 --> 00:09:15,091
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the way that the numbers look, and again, we will talk about this in the larger

102
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:16,935
[SPEAKER_07]: committee meeting.

103
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:23,360
[SPEAKER_07]: But if I understand correctly, the way the numbers are coming out now is a is proficient.

104
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much across the board.

105
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:27,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

106
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:30,566
[SPEAKER_05]: When you look at that and we can scroll down through the rest of them, too.

107
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:35,670
[SPEAKER_05]: But well, these are the these are the three the three main areas.

108
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:36,791
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

109
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:41,475
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the three where we all had to take all of our scores and and

110
00:09:43,314 --> 00:09:43,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

111
00:09:43,694 --> 00:09:46,356
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll see that later on page three or whatever.

112
00:09:46,376 --> 00:09:46,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

113
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:46,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

114
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:49,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought your instructions were very helpful as well.

115
00:09:49,838 --> 00:10:00,844
[SPEAKER_07]: So essentially what you had said to us was go to page three, do your individual assessments based on what you think.

116
00:10:00,884 --> 00:10:12,390
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you're taking those individual assessments and assigning the number of significant progress met or exceeded based on various committee members input.

117
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:17,271
[SPEAKER_07]: and then the same with the standards that we all agreed upon.

118
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:18,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

119
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, that was a good way to summarize it.

120
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,956
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think it's been super helpful.

121
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:28,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think that obviously there'll be some, so that's the quantitative data.

122
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and there'll be some qualitative data that will be brought to the table at the next.

123
00:10:35,114 --> 00:10:37,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, school committee meeting, um, when we.

124
00:10:38,796 --> 00:10:40,257
[SPEAKER_07]: When we share this out, is that right?

125
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:47,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, in terms of the comments from members, yes, we can either I mean, we can either work on that.

126
00:10:49,130 --> 00:11:16,693
[SPEAKER_05]: here or here if we can get them to all together into a document or we can we do have another subcommittee meeting scheduled where we could look at that and I think what we had said as part of the process was that the subcommittee would would put selected comments in to kind of represent the ratings that we would select comments from the various members evaluations and

127
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:23,583
[SPEAKER_05]: create the composite, including the comments to bring to the whole committee.

128
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:26,586
[SPEAKER_07]: So may I?

129
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:27,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

130
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:28,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

131
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:37,839
[SPEAKER_07]: So would it be helpful to have all of the narrative in one like, you know, Google Doc or something that is shared?

132
00:11:39,799 --> 00:12:03,178
[SPEAKER_07]: individually with us where we cannot respond to each other, so that we're not violating any public meeting rules, where we could potentially highlight comments that we feel are representative of the whole, probably as like sort of homework before the next meeting?

133
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:05,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

134
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,782
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a really good suggestion, because as I said,

135
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd envisioned having it ready for this meeting and we could actually just do it together at this meeting.

136
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:27,399
[SPEAKER_05]: But given that that, you know, the time frame didn't allow for that, maybe that's the best way to move forward is to create the finish creating that Google Doc, which I've already started, but just haven't been able to finish.

137
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And like you said, I can share that with you and member Graham.

138
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:37,143
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we meet on April 1st, I believe it is, we could probably have a pretty

139
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:42,399
[SPEAKER_05]: efficient meeting in terms of choosing out the comments.

140
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you mean June 1st, right?

141
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,101
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, I keep saying April today for some reason.

142
00:12:47,701 --> 00:12:49,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, June 1st.

143
00:12:49,321 --> 00:12:49,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

144
00:12:49,761 --> 00:12:52,582
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

145
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:53,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

146
00:12:54,463 --> 00:13:01,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want to scroll down and you can see some of the other, we can view some of the other scores just so people have an idea of

147
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:05,018
[SPEAKER_05]: where some of these fell out.

148
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:20,607
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the specific, the superintendent's specific goals, early literacy, her professional practice goal, and her three district improvement goals.

149
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:28,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And feel free to ask any questions.

150
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:32,615
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is really just, I just pulled the data straight out from everyone's

151
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:34,605
[SPEAKER_05]: individual evaluations.

152
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:41,012
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see it really all does fall kind of in that middle, the met range.

153
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:50,804
[SPEAKER_05]: And then these are the individual standards and the indicators of how people vote rated on the indicators.

154
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Standard one instructional leadership.

155
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:06,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Standard two, management and operations, there was just one indicator chosen.

156
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:18,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's standard three, family and community engagement.

157
00:14:26,405 --> 00:14:27,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally,

158
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,041
[SPEAKER_03]: standard for professional culture.

159
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:57,420
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess from here do we need to make a motion that will that that would be the next step would be that I'll send um create the combined uh the document of combined comments and uh

160
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:04,988
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll meet next time and go through those to fill in the comment sections of the composite.

161
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:07,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

162
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I see your hand up.

163
00:15:15,412 --> 00:15:17,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham, did you want to say something?

164
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:32,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, she just texted me that she can't be unmuted.

165
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:33,555
[SPEAKER_05]: She can't unmute.

166
00:15:33,896 --> 00:15:34,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

167
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:35,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me, let me see what I can do.

168
00:16:03,482 --> 00:16:04,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, can you hear me?

169
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:05,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

170
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:06,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

171
00:16:06,223 --> 00:16:14,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't turn on my camera for reasons I don't understand, but I just didn't want you to think I was sitting here not paying attention.

172
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:19,046
[SPEAKER_06]: I am totally fine with that approach.

173
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:21,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

174
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:26,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we, I don't know, do we need to vote on that or is that more formal than we need to?

175
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:30,369
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you need a motion, but what do you think?

176
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:32,736
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

177
00:16:33,136 --> 00:16:34,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't think so.

178
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:37,737
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two meetings scheduled to do this work.

179
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:40,758
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that's just really a continuation.

180
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:49,119
[SPEAKER_06]: We might just at the end of the meeting, instead of motioning to adjourn, we might just motion to continue the meeting.

181
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:51,980
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the table motion to table to the next meeting.

182
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,801
[SPEAKER_06]: But the close out of the meeting, I think we call it something different.

183
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:57,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

184
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:23,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and to be clear if people are wondering, like again that are watching or whatever if they're wondering why we're not discussing, you know, the, the ratings themselves that's not the purpose of the meeting this meeting is really to as a, as a, you know, the evaluation subcommittee to really

185
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,589
[SPEAKER_07]: work on the process, right?

186
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:28,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hayes.

187
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct, yeah.

188
00:17:32,431 --> 00:17:38,213
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it would, instead of being a motion to adjourn, it would be a motion to continue the meeting on June 1st.

189
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:40,974
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

190
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:45,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, does anyone have anything else to add about this?

191
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:50,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess at this point, the data is in.

192
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:55,478
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is just that question of adding in the comments.

193
00:17:56,592 --> 00:18:01,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we get a timeline member Hayes, excuse me, may I speak, please.

194
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:01,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

195
00:18:01,635 --> 00:18:02,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, of course.

196
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:17,784
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we get a timeline on when you want to get the qualitative material to us and when you'd like us to get back to you with the highlighted material before the next meeting that would be helpful just to put it in my calendar.

197
00:18:20,091 --> 00:18:21,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I will be getting that to you.

198
00:18:21,731 --> 00:18:29,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'll be getting the finishing, completing the Google Doc that's already in the, it's in the shared folder I already sent you.

199
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:42,496
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that, I think that actually the next meeting is for us to together create the, decide upon the comments to go in the comment section.

200
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:45,456
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not really sure there's any, I don't think there's anything you need to send to me.

201
00:18:45,476 --> 00:18:45,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, that's right.

202
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:46,996
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not getting them back to you.

203
00:18:47,016 --> 00:18:49,177
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just highlighting the homework in the meantime, right?

204
00:18:49,217 --> 00:18:49,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

205
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see a hand raised from Jess.

206
00:18:58,144 --> 00:18:58,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

207
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:01,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Jess able to unmute, or is she?

208
00:19:02,447 --> 00:19:03,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

209
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:05,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?

210
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:07,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

211
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:07,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

212
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,191
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a quick question.

213
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:19,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you ask parents or teachers anything for this, or is it just the school committee that does the grading for the performance?

214
00:19:21,358 --> 00:19:23,220
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a school committee process.

215
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,884
[SPEAKER_05]: The school committee is responsible for evaluating the superintendent.

216
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

217
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:30,947
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

218
00:19:30,987 --> 00:19:31,948
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wasn't sure.

219
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:32,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

220
00:19:32,868 --> 00:19:33,349
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

221
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:40,876
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if anyone had anything to add to that, if there was anything I missed about community input.

222
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:45,119
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of actual writing of the,

223
00:19:46,431 --> 00:20:03,779
[SPEAKER_05]: the superintendent evaluation, that is our responsibility in terms of community input, that would probably be more through any evidence that the superintendent provides for us of community input on any of the areas that she's being evaluated on.

224
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:06,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct to say, yes?

225
00:20:07,092 --> 00:20:08,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, you're correct.

226
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:15,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I would just add to that, that this is a legal requirement for school committees.

227
00:20:16,017 --> 00:20:21,479
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the three responsibilities that are set out under the law for school committees.

228
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,562
[SPEAKER_06]: School committees do have, just for your information, some latitude in terms of

229
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:28,943
[SPEAKER_06]: what process they establish.

230
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:45,347
[SPEAKER_06]: And your point is well taken that perhaps in the future, we should think about a public input part of the process, because I think that's important to all of us.

231
00:20:45,407 --> 00:20:47,868
[SPEAKER_06]: So just more to say,

232
00:20:49,048 --> 00:21:06,334
[SPEAKER_06]: The process is laid out and how we submit the results is very defined, but we do have the latitude to outline the process itself that leads to that kind of standardized reporting to DESE that we have conducted this review.

233
00:21:06,694 --> 00:21:08,695
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is some latitude there, and I do think

234
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:27,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Jess's point is well taken, that we should think about that for future, which would require some set of activity, like before this meeting in particular, so that we could hear that input and have a process for how we might include that.

235
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:32,607
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think just for your information, great suggestion, Jess.

236
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:32,988
[SPEAKER_06]: And

237
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:34,969
[SPEAKER_06]: we should think about that in the future.

238
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:43,732
[SPEAKER_06]: I will also note that this is probably the earliest we've ever been able to have an organized process.

239
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:55,055
[SPEAKER_06]: The last couple of years, we've made a lot of progress to doing this consistently and clearly, and this is just another step of progress, at least in the four years that I've been on the committee.

240
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:56,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

241
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:02,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I think we're always looking for ways to improve the process and improve our ways of

242
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:06,448
[SPEAKER_05]: getting information to evaluate.

243
00:22:06,508 --> 00:22:14,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that as member Graham said, looking for a way to include the community in the process would certainly be a next step, a next goal for next year.

244
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:25,131
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, if there are any, not any other questions from either the committee or from any members of the public?

245
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hayes, I think somebody, Paul has his hand in the air, Paul Garrity.

246
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank you, I didn't see that.

247
00:22:36,263 --> 00:22:40,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't tell if you were clapping, Paul, or you had your hand up.

248
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:42,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Mr. Garrity, go ahead.

249
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:46,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he needs to be able to be unmuted.

250
00:22:47,153 --> 00:22:49,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's someone else.

251
00:22:50,796 --> 00:22:52,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Superintendent, are you able to unmute him?

252
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:55,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, ladies.

253
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thank you.

254
00:22:57,182 --> 00:22:58,222
[SPEAKER_00]: My quick question is that,

255
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:11,927
[SPEAKER_00]: When this report is finally shared with the public as a whole, will the metrics that were used by the individual reviewers also be made part of the presentation?

256
00:23:11,947 --> 00:23:16,229
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, there's columns with numbers and saying, this is our evaluation.

257
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:26,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we have some kind of metrics that says what do the individual reviewers use to make that determination that resulted in a number for a particular category?

258
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:29,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, good question.

259
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:47,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we use the self-evaluation from the superintendent, where she gives us an update on, it's all based on the goals that the superintendent and the school committee discussed at the beginning of the year, the agreed upon goals and indicators.

260
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:56,057
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the superintendent presented her self-evaluation two weeks ago, and that's the information that we use to

261
00:23:57,332 --> 00:23:58,713
[SPEAKER_05]: complete our evaluations.

262
00:23:59,713 --> 00:24:02,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Does any other member have something more to add to that?

263
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:13,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I would also just say that that self-evaluation also included various forms of evidence that support the narrative that was provided.

264
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, for example, there were

265
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:29,831
[SPEAKER_06]: scores from our map testing from last year and this year that were provided to us to provide evidence around the student learning goal, for example.

266
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:35,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is both the superintendent's narrative and evidence that she provides.

267
00:24:36,534 --> 00:24:39,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think also, you know, just

268
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:49,865
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of our own like point of view and experience over the course of the year as we have been thinking about this evaluation and our work on the school committee.

269
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:55,370
[SPEAKER_06]: All of that is part of what goes into everyone's individual ratings and rankings.

270
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:56,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

271
00:24:57,611 --> 00:25:05,057
[SPEAKER_00]: So was that uniform across the views, the individual views or the uniform or how do I, I know that they were uniform approach.

272
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:11,029
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, can you further explain what the question is?

273
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:14,569
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have three people sitting in a class and three people making an observation.

274
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:20,311
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know that we're utilizing the same reference points, the same metrics, the same key indicators?

275
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:22,591
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm trying to get a feel for.

276
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:25,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the short answer is you don't.

277
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:30,613
[SPEAKER_06]: There are seven individual members of the committee, all who

278
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:34,161
[SPEAKER_06]: have different points of view.

279
00:25:34,562 --> 00:25:40,423
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the way that we start to coalesce to a single point of view that is our committee's view.

280
00:25:40,963 --> 00:25:43,784
[SPEAKER_06]: So we all obviously are looking at the same evidence.

281
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:55,487
[SPEAKER_06]: We may see that evidence differently because we may have had different deeper discussions and been working on things, you know, outside of committee meetings and

282
00:25:55,947 --> 00:25:56,607
[SPEAKER_06]: and what have you.

283
00:25:56,707 --> 00:26:02,348
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first step is for the committee to say individually and independently, this is how we are feeling.

284
00:26:03,008 --> 00:26:14,750
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the ultimate product here is the review that represents the committee's view by a majority vote.

285
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:24,432
[SPEAKER_06]: So the recognition is that individuals are going to have their own perspective, and that's the starting point to coalesce to the review that gets approved.

286
00:26:27,642 --> 00:26:28,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

287
00:26:28,502 --> 00:26:50,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just wanted to add that I think what I'm hearing too is that, you know, the evidence that's there and we are, that's part of the process that we're going through now in terms of making this process uniform using the rubric that DESI provides around evaluation, identifying in advance what the goals are, what goals and items are being evaluated,

288
00:26:50,571 --> 00:27:01,450
[SPEAKER_07]: And that we're using this specific rubric to do this which has not been the case in the past so that's all publicly available information that's all part of what you see here in the in the.

289
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:19,985
[SPEAKER_07]: in the material that we just shared, but also, you know, DESE has their superintendent rubric online, the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and was one of the reasons that we really wanted to standardize the form and use what other people are using so that we're comparing apples to apples across districts and amongst each other.

290
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:25,106
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other piece I think I heard you say was that, would you know what individuals reported?

291
00:27:25,286 --> 00:27:27,946
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, that's part of public information.

292
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:31,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are also sharing that as part of

293
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:42,530
[SPEAKER_07]: a vote that we took earlier that each of our reports are, you know, they're public anyway, but that we would all, you know, essentially be able to see or have that information that we saw individually.

294
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:53,872
[SPEAKER_07]: But this subcommittee is tasked with bringing all that information together under member Hayes' stewardship and direction to bring all the information together.

295
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:56,893
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's part of why we're looking at the, you know, quantitative data.

296
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:59,934
[SPEAKER_07]: The numbers are a little bit easier to just sort of put together.

297
00:27:59,954 --> 00:28:01,174
[SPEAKER_07]: The qualitative data can be

298
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:14,978
[SPEAKER_07]: a little bit more time-consuming because we might have seven, you know, well, we will have seven narratives, but I suspect that a lot of them will be similar and some of them may be dissimilar, and that's sort of what we'll be charted with.

299
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:26,642
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I just, if I might, Member Hayes, I wanted to also address the question from Jess, who, I don't know Jess's last name, but sorry, Jess, that we didn't get the name for the record, but

300
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:33,988
[SPEAKER_07]: to just share that part of the superintendent evaluation process should be happening throughout the year, right?

301
00:28:34,008 --> 00:28:38,413
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean we're all hearing from constituents as school committee members about what

302
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:52,515
[SPEAKER_07]: their experiences are in the district what they would like to see changed or better or improved what they think is working, you know how things are sort of happening so we're seeing that throughout the year we definitely have public participation throughout the year as well.

303
00:28:53,055 --> 00:29:00,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a longer conversation for the entire committee to have around, you know how and in what way.

304
00:29:01,422 --> 00:29:09,745
[SPEAKER_07]: there'd be public participation in superintendent evaluation and also looking at what other districts are doing and what the protocol is and sort of all of those things.

305
00:29:09,825 --> 00:29:18,048
[SPEAKER_07]: And because it can also, as you can imagine, the people that show up might be the squeaky wheels and the people that don't might not be.

306
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:28,492
[SPEAKER_07]: So there sort of has to be a process that we all agree is equitable and is one that is consistent and one that the MASC, which is the Mass Association of School Committees,

307
00:29:29,072 --> 00:29:37,874
[SPEAKER_07]: and the MASS, which is the Mass Association of School Superintendents, would surely offer advice and let us know best practices around doing that as well.

308
00:29:37,954 --> 00:29:41,514
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that there's always opportunity for feedback.

309
00:29:42,234 --> 00:29:45,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that you guys are reaching out to us to let us know.

310
00:29:45,755 --> 00:29:50,676
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, I know that the superintendent has been receptive as well in terms of people reaching out to her.

311
00:29:50,736 --> 00:29:52,076
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would encourage that too.

312
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:58,457
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's part of the building relationships that we should all be working on in terms of the family and community engagement.

313
00:29:59,017 --> 00:30:01,680
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just I just sort of wanted to mention that as well.

314
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:10,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, my concern consistency review and that the key indicators are shared universally across all members when they make their determinations.

315
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:11,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

316
00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:11,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

317
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:12,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

318
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, it is as part of the data that's that's if I may member pays I'm sorry.

319
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:16,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

320
00:30:18,128 --> 00:30:19,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, that's why we're going with a rubric.

321
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:21,190
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, you're absolutely right.

322
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,572
[SPEAKER_07]: It's shared with all the members across the board, same rubric.

323
00:30:23,972 --> 00:30:31,057
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all evaluating based on the items we agreed to evaluate based on the superintendent's goal.

324
00:30:31,077 --> 00:30:32,758
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are making it much more uniform.

325
00:30:32,818 --> 00:30:35,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for asking and for noticing.

326
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

327
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:45,627
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would just add, I think that at our meeting, when we present this to the entire committee for them to vote on the final composite,

328
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:54,705
[SPEAKER_05]: I think at that point, we will talk as a committee about how exactly we want to share this, what's the best way to share this so that everyone has access to it.

329
00:30:55,245 --> 00:31:10,333
[SPEAKER_05]: We've talked about a couple of different ways of possibly putting it on the website and making sure that everyone has access to both the composite, but also our individual evaluations.

330
00:31:10,353 --> 00:31:15,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as both member Graham and member McLaughlin have said, it's all public information.

331
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:20,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Desi doesn't specify how we share it or how we make it public.

332
00:31:21,664 --> 00:31:23,725
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really up to us to make that decision.

333
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:33,508
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've looked around at other districts and it's remarkably difficult actually to find in many districts to find the superintendent evaluation.

334
00:31:33,588 --> 00:31:41,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really kind of up to us to create that process and decide how we wanna share it and create that access for the community.

335
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:45,151
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just offer in closing that it's,

336
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:54,920
[SPEAKER_00]: to educate the citizenry in terms of what were the key indicators that were being observed and that they were universally applied across the board.

337
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,023
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be very helpful if that was explained during the entire presentation.

338
00:31:58,143 --> 00:31:58,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

339
00:31:59,713 --> 00:31:59,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

340
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:00,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

341
00:32:01,114 --> 00:32:12,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hayes, if I might, I just also want to express that this is the literal only place I've ever seen somebody's performance review be aired in public.

342
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,741
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's incredibly awkward.

343
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:27,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a problematic process for many, many, many reasons, which is probably why you don't see too many districts sort of blasting this information on their website.

344
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:32,375
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of the day, Dr Edward Vincent is our employee.

345
00:32:32,916 --> 00:32:38,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we also have to be mindful that there are lots of employment laws at play.

346
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:39,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And we need to.

347
00:32:40,487 --> 00:32:42,950
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to take care I think Mr Gary to.

348
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:57,684
[SPEAKER_06]: to sort of balance the fact that this is all public information and the fact that the superintendent is our employee and she does have rights as an employee of the district.

349
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:59,526
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the sticky part.

350
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:05,171
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that, but I think we take it to a higher level and I agree with that, but I think we take it to the higher level.

351
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:06,212
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the goals.

352
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:08,694
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the metrics to see if the goals were achieved.

353
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:16,795
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did people on the reviewing committee apply those metrics to the goals that were stated is fair enough approach.

354
00:33:17,756 --> 00:33:18,016
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

355
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:19,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can certainly do that.

356
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:30,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, all the, the, um, the measures that were selected were selected in open meeting, but, um, maybe there's like a summary slide member Hayes or something that can be put together to say, this was, this was the focus for this year.

357
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:38,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think the program overall is what's important to make the judgment on, but it contributes their parts to it.

358
00:33:39,482 --> 00:33:42,984
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's also important, which is also publicly available.

359
00:33:43,364 --> 00:33:51,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, the superintendent's goals for the year that are posted, and they're also goals that are shared goals.

360
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:55,830
[SPEAKER_05]: We work on them together, the superintendent and the school committee at the beginning of the year.

361
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:04,834
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really where the, I don't know if the metrics so much, but the decisions about what are the particular focus areas.

362
00:34:05,372 --> 00:34:10,754
[SPEAKER_05]: that is done, again, in open meeting, and it's also a document that's on the website that everyone can look at.

363
00:34:11,874 --> 00:34:12,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

364
00:34:12,075 --> 00:34:13,115
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the original draft.

365
00:34:13,195 --> 00:34:14,235
[SPEAKER_00]: I review it quite often.

366
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:16,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

367
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:17,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

368
00:34:17,997 --> 00:34:18,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

369
00:34:19,165 --> 00:34:20,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin, your hand's up.

370
00:34:20,366 --> 00:34:21,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you have something else to add?

371
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,007
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

372
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:35,434
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say that I think it is good practice just as part of whenever we're, you know, orienting the community to what we're doing, you know, here's where we were, here's what we did, here's where we're going, here's what we're presenting, whatever.

373
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:39,176
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think a primer slide or, you know, one or two, you know, here's

374
00:34:39,636 --> 00:34:56,042
[SPEAKER_07]: The, you know, here are the goals here the, you know, pieces that we evaluated on and here's what the evaluation wants is always good sort of just again because not everybody is necessarily accessing the website, not everybody is necessarily, you know, coming to a public meeting or watching the meetings on MCM or

375
00:34:56,982 --> 00:34:57,443
[SPEAKER_07]: what have you.

376
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:04,526
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's just always good if people, you know, decide to tune in for that or if we have a record of the information is sort of this was what the process was.

377
00:35:04,606 --> 00:35:11,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think it could be really helpful to have a one-page, you know, piece and I'm happy to help work with you on that if you'd like.

378
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,471
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be great because I am, oh sorry.

379
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:14,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.

380
00:35:15,372 --> 00:35:20,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wanted to say, I'm still, as I said, I'm still working on some of the other pieces so it would be helpful if.

381
00:35:20,775 --> 00:35:21,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

382
00:35:21,842 --> 00:35:24,785
[SPEAKER_05]: someone maybe could pick up that piece of it, that creation of the slide.

383
00:35:24,805 --> 00:35:26,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'd be happy to do that.

384
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:28,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think you did it really already.

385
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:34,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you did the majority of the work already in the instructions.

386
00:35:34,874 --> 00:35:37,857
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it would just be a matter of simplifying that on a slide or two.

387
00:35:37,897 --> 00:35:40,820
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to do that and modify you guys at the next one.

388
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

389
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:42,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Wonderful, thanks so much.

390
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:53,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, so I would make an emotion that we continue the meeting to June 1st for our subcommittee meeting.

391
00:35:55,476 --> 00:35:58,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, I'll take a roll call vote then.

392
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:00,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

393
00:36:01,357 --> 00:36:01,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

394
00:36:02,697 --> 00:36:03,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin?

395
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:04,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

396
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:05,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Hayes?

397
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:06,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

398
00:36:06,578 --> 00:36:08,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

399
00:36:09,518 --> 00:36:12,120
[SPEAKER_05]: So this meeting is then, do we have to also adjourn?

400
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Continued.

401
00:36:12,741 --> 00:36:13,642
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, we're continued.

402
00:36:13,662 --> 00:36:15,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Continued, sorry.

403
00:36:15,583 --> 00:36:15,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

404
00:36:15,944 --> 00:36:17,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye everyone, have a good day.

405
00:36:17,325 --> 00:36:18,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, thank you everyone.

406
00:36:18,066 --> 00:36:18,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
