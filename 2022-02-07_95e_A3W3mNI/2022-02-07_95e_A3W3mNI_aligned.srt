1
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:06,885
Member Graham?

2
00:00:07,365 --> 00:00:07,605
Here.

3
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:11,346
Member Hayes is online.

4
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:16,467
She probably should say here, so is she unmuted?

5
00:00:16,807 --> 00:00:17,807
Yeah.

6
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:25,369
Ms.

7
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:25,729
Hayes?

8
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:26,849
Member Hayes?

9
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:28,029
Here.

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,610
Oh.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:32,810
Member Kratz?

12
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:35,491
Member Kratz?

13
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:36,439
Here.

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,480
Member McLaughlin.

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:38,940
Here.

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,821
Member McStone.

17
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:40,341
Here.

18
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:42,182
Member Russo here.

19
00:00:42,602 --> 00:00:43,202
Mayor Landau here.

20
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:43,962
Present.

21
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,523
Seven present.

22
00:00:45,823 --> 00:00:46,563
Zero absent.

23
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,884
Do we have any student representatives on the call?

24
00:00:50,865 --> 00:00:51,365
Not tonight.

25
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:51,826
Not tonight.

26
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:52,526
Thank you.

27
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:55,067
We all may rise to salute the flag.

28
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:20,945
We have the consent agenda, which is approval of bills, payrolls, committee of the whole meeting minutes from January 24th, 2022, regular school committee meeting minutes, January 24th, 2022, committee of the whole meeting minutes, February 3rd, 2022.

29
00:01:28,327 --> 00:01:30,488
I just had one thing to mention.

30
00:01:31,488 --> 00:01:43,031
I just wanted to say I sent an email today to Susie with three small updates, just spelling of some names, you know, members names and missing one word in one of the motions.

31
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:48,112
So, but a motion to second to accept with those amendments.

32
00:01:50,703 --> 00:01:59,590
Motion for approval as amended by, approval by Member McLaughlin as amended by Member Kretz, seconded by Member Kretz.

33
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,631
All those in favor?

34
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:02,633
All those opposed?

35
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:04,634
Mayor?

36
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:10,499
I'm not actually sure procedurally if we're supposed to ask Member Hayes for her vote.

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:11,880
I don't know.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,042
I think she should stay unmuted and respond.

39
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:15,083
Oh, thank you.

40
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:17,104
If it's real time.

41
00:02:17,465 --> 00:02:20,107
Member Hayes, are you in favor of approving the consent agenda?

42
00:02:20,505 --> 00:02:23,146
Yes.

43
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:23,186
7-0.

44
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,366
We have number four, good of the order.

45
00:02:27,386 --> 00:02:35,548
Good of the order is a time set aside for members to offer comments or observations without formal motions about society and its work.

46
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,789
Process for motions not abided.

47
00:02:37,929 --> 00:02:43,190
For example, 11-15 budget schedule and 12-6 school committee tour of locker rooms.

48
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,570
Presented by member McLaughlin.

49
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,292
Thank you, Mayor.

50
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:57,656
The good of the order is a line item that occurs monthly for the school committee to review our work and how we're working together and collaborating.

51
00:02:57,696 --> 00:03:06,919
And one of the things that I was noticing was two motions, and I didn't go that far back, but I did notice two motions that have not been abided.

52
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,820
So these were motions that were approved.

53
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:13,464
by the committee as a whole on this floor.

54
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:21,436
So the 11-15 budget schedule motion and the 12-6 tour of locker rooms and the budget schedule motion was

55
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:45,872
Whereas Medford Public Schools has historically conducted the annual budgeting process commencing in April and concluding in June, whereas there's a substantive increase in COVID-related funding for FY 2022, whereas hiring practices in many districts are finalized by March, April, albeit resolved, the Medford Public Schools budgeting process commenced in January and concluded in March, with budget recommendations presented to the city council in March.

56
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:49,424
So that, again, that was approved by the body.

57
00:03:49,564 --> 00:04:04,240
And then there was also a 12-6 school committee tour of locker rooms, the female and male locker rooms, or I guess that aren't gender specific, but the locker rooms for touring in December.

58
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,503
And so we had a presentation by,

59
00:04:09,372 --> 00:04:22,219
the finance director, assistant superintendent Dave Murphy about ideas for the budget and how we would approach the budget, but that did not address the motion that had been passed and also the tour of the locker room.

60
00:04:22,239 --> 00:04:34,545
So I'm asking my colleagues sort of how do we proceed if we have motions that have been passed by the body, but have not been acted on or had partially been acted on.

61
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:45,720
Member McLaughlin, maybe start by emailing the superintendent and whatever department head would be responsible for the report just to get an update.

62
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:49,424
And then I think this is a good way to send a reminder.

63
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:52,768
I don't know if anybody else has ideas.

64
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:53,489
Member Graham.

65
00:04:55,242 --> 00:05:09,289
While we haven't finished going through the rules, I do think there are some meaningful things happening in the rules document that will make it easier and more transparent to track the things that we are passing.

66
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:21,814
So the new numbering system, some of the changes to the way the agenda is being presented, some of the many reasons why I'm in favor of having rules that are documented.

67
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:37,830
And I do think, you know, those things are important and would ask the superintendent that if the dates don't work, that you just kindly let us know and that we can figure out a better path forward.

68
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:44,878
But I am also in support of making sure that there is compliance with the motions passed on the floor.

69
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:48,465
May I?

70
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:49,726
Member McLaughlin?

71
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:53,649
Yeah, I just wanted to be clear that this is not a reflection on the superintendent.

72
00:05:53,889 --> 00:06:09,400
I actually feel like it's our body as a school committee as a whole and us sort of working together to ensure, and I do agree with Member Graham, that the numbering of the motions and having a list of motions that have been approved will help with this process.

73
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,722
But I guess I'm asking sort of

74
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:28,467
what the procedure is, and it sounds like I'm hearing from the chair, procedurally to email the superintendent if there's motions that have happened that have not been moved forward, but I would suspect that we also need to email or let our body know.

75
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:39,051
So I'm looking for a process as to what that looks like so that we can let the body know if there are items that haven't been moved forward that have been voted on.

76
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:43,799
as a whole, not just the superintendent.

77
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:45,599
So that's the question I'm asking procedurally.

78
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:52,700
And we don't have this from what I can see in any of the policies that we've had set or any of the rule proposals.

79
00:06:52,760 --> 00:07:00,902
So I guess I'm asking what the body thinks should be done or how can we have a procedure?

80
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:04,503
So if then procedure, if this happens, then this happens.

81
00:07:05,085 --> 00:07:17,355
you know, if a motion has been passed and has not happened by the date that it was due, then, you know, an email gets sent to central administration and to school committee, you know, by the member, I suppose, who made the motion.

82
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:23,779
I don't know if that's agreeable to the committee as a whole, but putting that out there.

83
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:26,602
Yes.

84
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:33,427
What about if on the agenda, it was added, I know we have added

85
00:07:34,001 --> 00:07:38,923
sometimes old items, you know, unresolved.

86
00:07:39,503 --> 00:07:58,952
So I'm thinking, you know, if the motions were expressed and the date was listed, it could just be carried at the end of the agenda to be trapped, you know, for the outstanding motions.

87
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:01,753
That might be a possibility.

88
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:03,604
That's an option.

89
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:07,607
Yeah, I think that could be really helpful just because for everybody.

90
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,709
I mean, I think we're all busy and things slip by, so that could be good.

91
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:13,471
I mean, I think the list could potentially get long.

92
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:18,054
So I'm willing to try that if folks are willing to try that and see how that goes.

93
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:23,017
So then we're all on top of the dates and the due dates, if that works with my colleagues.

94
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:28,660
Maybe we should just ask the administration if that is a good idea.

95
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,002
I know it's a lot of reports, but.

96
00:08:32,755 --> 00:08:48,099
I had originally liked the email, the superintendent and the body, because I just remember previous agendas where we had a running list and it like went on to a second page and it ended up being very lengthy.

97
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:59,863
I think now with the new numbering system, to be able to keep track of is,

98
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:09,511
2022 14, you know, submitted, whatever, like the numbers, I think.

99
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:12,842
I think that'll allow us to do it.

100
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:23,651
So, I mean, right now the agenda is pretty, it's pretty full and we still have reports requested also on the agenda.

101
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:25,332
Right now we currently don't have that.

102
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:31,016
So, I think with the new numbering system, it'll allow us to,

103
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:34,838
be able to try to address the motions.

104
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:54,704
And if we realize that we're going to be behind schedule, then to email the entire, if you don't email me first for me to be able to email all of you and say, we're going to be behind on a particular motion that, you know, we're going to miss a deadline, but we'll get it done as soon as possible.

105
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:56,365
Okay.

106
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:57,385
Thank you, mayor.

107
00:10:02,088 --> 00:10:14,675
I think one of the things about the numbering system that I really am looking forward to is, in fact, that anything that is undisposed of remains on the agenda.

108
00:10:14,995 --> 00:10:16,816
I don't actually care how long it gets.

109
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:26,162
I think it's very easy to keep track of what is undisposed of at City Council because they sit on the agenda until they are disposed of.

110
00:10:27,522 --> 00:10:29,303
So I am in favor of that.

111
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:31,963
It brings a level of transparency to the conversation.

112
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:45,247
It makes it top of mind, and it doesn't rely on individual members remembering what it is that they're supposed to be tracking themselves for seeing things all the way to the end.

113
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:52,829
Things move really fast, and I would be a proponent of all of that stuff remaining on the agenda until it's disposed of.

114
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,340
Thank you.

115
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,304
I also agree the long agenda is fine and looking at the last agenda of the Worcester school committee it's 184 pages long.

116
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,321
So I think a little context on how big an agenda can be is important.

117
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:10,941
They don't go through all of it, of course.

118
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,522
Could you just speak up a little bit, Member Russo?

119
00:11:12,562 --> 00:11:12,922
Sorry.

120
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:13,802
Sorry.

121
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:18,023
I was just saying, I'm looking at the last agenda for the Worcester School Committee.

122
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,543
It's 184 pages long.

123
00:11:19,703 --> 00:11:33,607
So I too am in favor of everything that is not disposed of remains in a section, but I think that we also have to acknowledge that we can't make a rule or make a motion as part of good of the order.

124
00:11:41,504 --> 00:11:44,947
Yes, I think that sounds good.

125
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:51,752
As member Russo was saying, we can't do a motion under the good of the order, but it sounds like there's some conversation around this.

126
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:57,055
And I think it makes sense to have it tracked as well, just as a reminder for us.

127
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:03,200
And again, I think it can get long, but at least then we'll have an idea of what's moved forward and what hasn't.

128
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:19,092
I'm okay with this item if you want to move forward, Mayor, and if we feel that there needs to be a motion to have this on the agenda, we can certainly put that on the agenda for next session, but hopefully that, you know, we don't need to do that.

129
00:12:19,612 --> 00:12:20,393
Okay, sounds great.

130
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:21,514
Thank you.

131
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:22,054
Thank you.

132
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,357
Number five, reports of subcommittee, which I don't believe there are any.

133
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:29,239
Number six is reports of superintendent.

134
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,921
First up is superintendent's updates and comments.

135
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:34,003
Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, superintendent.

136
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,430
Good evening.

137
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:53,653
So last week, unfortunately, malignant weather disrupted the school week and we needed to call two days last week.

138
00:12:55,494 --> 00:13:05,856
I want to send our apologies to our Mustang families whose students travel to out-of-district placements for the lack of communication on the first of these two days.

139
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:13,091
When Medford calls a snow day, all Medford transportation vehicles are canceled.

140
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:21,298
Therefore, we are unable to transport our out-of-district students to their facilities in other districts that may not have called off school.

141
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:30,889
I am thankful for our collaboration with Medford CPAC, who had alerted us about this communication omission.

142
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:38,631
I sincerely apologize to our out-of-district families who are not included in last week's no school announcement.

143
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:47,373
Please know that we have fixed the communication glitch, and we'll be sure to notify out-of-district families of all snow days in the future.

144
00:13:50,800 --> 00:14:14,639
I am pleased to announce that two of our Medford Vocational Technical High School students, biotech students, Jessica Rehick and Ariana Feliz, have been accepted to the prestigious BioBuilder Apprenticeship Challenge, which will expose them to state-of-the-art concepts and hands-on training in synthetic biology.

145
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,641
The training will take place after school three times a week at biobuilder labs.

146
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:31,984
The students will be able to spend time learning in a state-of-the-art research lab, assisting with molecular biology experiments, and analyzing data.

147
00:14:33,484 --> 00:14:42,406
They'll also have the opportunity to learn lab math and bioengineering principles, as well as develop professional skills.

148
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:51,663
The students will work in teams to prepare a scientific poster for a networking event that is attended by life science professionals.

149
00:14:52,864 --> 00:15:03,571
Once the students complete the apprenticeship challenge, they'll each receive a certificate and a small stipend at the graduation ceremony on May 12th of 2022.

150
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:12,397
Often, graduates of this challenge have been offered paid summer institutes, internships at local companies.

151
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:20,564
Congratulations to Jessica and Arianna, their teacher, Mr. Russo, and science director, Mr. Sealy.

152
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:33,855
A footnote, one of our Mustang 2020 graduates, Rachel Smiles, was a bio-builder apprentice and now has a full-time position at Indigo Agriculture.

153
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:42,422
Camp Mustang is completely filled now for February vacation.

154
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:50,791
I'm excited that close to 300 students have the opportunity to learn and grow during this program.

155
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:53,554
Again, registration is officially closed.

156
00:15:54,535 --> 00:16:00,376
In this Olympic year, programs like this reflect our goals that we can equate with the Olympic model.

157
00:16:00,956 --> 00:16:06,298
Faster, higher, stronger, together for all of our mistakes.

158
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:22,841
The Andrews Middle School CCSR program seeks donations for the Malden Warming Center, a collaborative service that provides a safe, warm place for those experiencing homelessness during the winter months.

159
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:42,847
There was a donation box in the Andrews Middle School lobby for shoes, sneakers, hand liners, small sturdy plates, paper plates, and bowls, hair elastics, men's sweatpants, and gif to go, individual peanut butter cups, to name a few.

160
00:16:46,103 --> 00:16:56,806
Also, due to our COVID-19 restrictions, the Medford Family Network's annual Valentine's Day ice cream social fundraiser could not be held in person again this year.

161
00:16:57,626 --> 00:17:02,788
Therefore, the friends of Medford Family Network have placed the fundraiser online.

162
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:12,931
Some of the waffle items include Valentine cookie and ice cream kits, gift cards to Semolina and Collette's Bakery,

163
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:19,217
spa gift cards, a photo shoot, and sensory exploration kits to name a few.

164
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:25,363
Interested parties should go to the school blog for the link by midnight tonight.

165
00:17:26,404 --> 00:17:30,829
Raffles will be drawn Wednesday and pickup or delivery is Friday.

166
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:45,472
Additionally, the Medford Family Network is presenting in English for speakers of other languages program, Tuesday and Thursday mornings, beginning March 1st in person at the Medford Family Network Center.

167
00:17:46,013 --> 00:17:50,375
Anyone interested must sign up by this Friday, February 11th.

168
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:53,397
Please contact Marie Cassidy at 71393-2106.

169
00:17:59,025 --> 00:18:07,029
Makkah Bhutia Day will be celebrated on February 16th, the date of the full moon in the third lunar month.

170
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:15,492
Makkah Bhutia Day is a Buddhist holiday observed to commemorate the meeting of Buddha and his first 1,200 disciples.

171
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:19,334
Makkah means month, and Bhutia means prayer.

172
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:27,498
On this day, Buddhists go to the temple to perform merit-making activities, as well as meditate and listen to teachings.

173
00:18:28,278 --> 00:18:33,721
To all of our Buddhist families and neighbors, I wish you a peaceful Malka Bucha Day.

174
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:37,083
A few upcoming events for this week.

175
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:44,987
Tomorrow evening, there is Building Bridges to Kindergarten from 6.30 to 7.30 p.m.

176
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:55,432
Building Bridges to Kindergarten will be online by Zoom only, so you can go on our website and look for the Zoom link.

177
00:18:56,633 --> 00:19:06,724
On Wednesday, February 9th, Medford CPAC meeting presents language-based learning disability accommodations and intervention.

178
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:11,569
That will be taking place on Zoom as well from 6 to 8 p.m.

179
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,351
on Wednesday, February 9th.

180
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:30,559
On Saturday, February 12th, CCSR and friends of the Medford Public Library have joined together to offer our teachers or librarians books for $5 at the Cambridge Savings Bank in Arlington.

181
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:40,303
Sign-ups are required, so you need to reach out to Rebecca Siegel at rsiegel22 at medford.k12.ma.us.

182
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:51,958
Also this Saturday at 10 o'clock in the morning, Spotlight is hosting the Spotlight Variety Show.

183
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,562
The Spotlight Variety Show is hosting a sensory-friendly event.

184
00:19:59,142 --> 00:20:06,666
That means there will be extra lighting, open doors, reduced volume, and students can bring technology.

185
00:20:06,686 --> 00:20:08,647
It's a technology-friendly environment.

186
00:20:09,067 --> 00:20:10,408
It's a one-hour performance.

187
00:20:10,908 --> 00:20:14,009
This Saturday at 10 a.m., tickets are $10 per person.

188
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:28,003
And lastly, on Wednesday, February 16th, the Asian Club will be hosting a lion dance in honor of Chinese Lunar New Year in the Medford High School gym.

189
00:20:29,244 --> 00:20:30,884
And more information to come.

190
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:31,685
Thank you.

191
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:38,887
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

192
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:45,890
Number two, we have a COVID update by Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations, Mr. David Murphy.

193
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:49,780
and Miss Avery Hines, who's the director of health services.

194
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,324
They will report on operational updates and pending COVID shifts in the Medford public school.

195
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:57,107
Miss Hines is on Zoom.

196
00:20:57,327 --> 00:20:58,668
Mr. Murphy is present.

197
00:20:59,469 --> 00:21:00,970
Just got to get your microphone turned on.

198
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,791
Thank you, mayor.

199
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:07,196
As the mayor said, Miss Hines is joining us remotely and would be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

200
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:12,044
There's one table that I'd ask Dr. Cushing to put up on your screen now.

201
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:17,447
If we could do just a full screen version of that so we can see it.

202
00:21:18,787 --> 00:21:22,349
So this is our grade level vaccination rate as of today.

203
00:21:23,489 --> 00:21:30,633
Similar to when we've updated you on our vaccination rates previously, these rates fluctuate daily.

204
00:21:31,418 --> 00:21:47,103
And in all likelihood do not represent a 100% accurate assessment of our vaccination rates because there are instances in which students become vaccinated through outside practitioners and numbers have not been updated in the state system.

205
00:21:47,163 --> 00:21:51,485
But it does represent, we think, something that's pretty close.

206
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:54,526
to our accurate numbers.

207
00:21:54,566 --> 00:22:14,834
And also, this is at a minimum, it's the floor, because this is everything that's in the state's databank as well at database rather, as well as it reflects all the vaccinations that our staff has done through our both weekly vaccination clinics that we've run as well.

208
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:21,057
And what it doesn't represent yet is our in-school vaccination clinics that we'll be talking a little bit about

209
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:22,418
this evening.

210
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:28,183
So as you can see, these numbers have gone up as we expected that they would, and Ms.

211
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:37,832
Hines could speak to how this potentially, from a public health perspective, where we think we are sort of as a community, but certainly these are encouraging numbers.

212
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:42,237
Not surprisingly, the students that have been eligible for a longer period of time

213
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:43,978
have a higher vaccination rate.

214
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:50,185
We have some concerns at both the kindergarten level and particularly at the sixth grade level where we're seeing a dip.

215
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:54,690
And that's something that we'll be doubling down on over the course of the coming weeks.

216
00:22:56,692 --> 00:23:02,218
But generally speaking, we feel positive about these numbers.

217
00:23:02,878 --> 00:23:03,599
I'm good with the slide.

218
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:04,540
Thank you, Dr. Pershing.

219
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:24,766
As I mentioned, we are, as we've talked about in the last couple of school committee meetings, and as we've communicated in a variety of ways to students, staff, and families in recent weeks, like much of society, we are transitioning from an emphasis on testing to an emphasis on vaccination.

220
00:23:25,346 --> 00:23:31,809
We've done that in a variety of ways that we think distinguish Medford Public Schools from other districts.

221
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:45,855
We've done it in close partnership with the City of Medford Board of Health and now we are sort of in the belt and suspenders phase as we have both our surveillance testing program, which will run through the remainder of this month,

222
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:54,395
as well as the rapid at-home test distribution made possible through the DESE's procurement of those rapid antigen tests.

223
00:23:54,435 --> 00:23:59,500
So our surveillance testing is up right now, as we've previously communicated.

224
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:05,286
This week does mark the first week in which the onus for contact tracing is on, by and

225
00:24:06,768 --> 00:24:08,931
the individual families when there is a positive case.

226
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:17,423
Thankfully, over the past couple of weeks we've seen a steady and consistent decline in the rate of positivity, which we're obviously happy about.

227
00:24:19,593 --> 00:24:30,238
We, as of right now, pending a continuous review of that data, will retire our surveillance testing program in the first week of March, so the week of February 28th.

228
00:24:31,459 --> 00:24:41,524
The rapid tests have been deployed as of today to staff who have, all Medford Public Schools staff are eligible to receive these tests just by filling out a consent form.

229
00:24:41,844 --> 00:24:48,407
This is a separate consent form than the ones that are on file for our surveillance testing program, and students are sending in their

230
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:50,588
their consent forms as well.

231
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:55,930
And distribution of their rapid tests will begin in the latter part of this week.

232
00:24:56,251 --> 00:25:00,012
So just last, just a couple of reminders.

233
00:25:00,753 --> 00:25:09,317
Our student athletes who have had mandatory testing up until this point, they will have mandatory participation in the rapid testing program.

234
00:25:10,017 --> 00:25:12,460
And that will start in the week of February vacation.

235
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:22,231
So for those participating in the winter athletic season, there will be a responsibility of the student athletes to pick up those rapid tests and participate in that program.

236
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:28,498
But the final week as of now for surveillance testing will be that week after February vacation.

237
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:32,759
improve positivity.

238
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:47,690
And finally, lastly, our in-school vaccination clinics, which are scheduled for next week at all elementary and middle schools, have approximately 100 students signed up to receive their vaccination, which is another number that we're very happy about.

239
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:55,956
And we're going to do another round of promotion communications-wise tomorrow to hopefully push that number up a little bit more.

240
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:58,078
So with that, I'm happy to take your questions.

241
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:03,242
I'm also happy to sit down.

242
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:03,582
Great.

243
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:05,123
Thank you for the update.

244
00:26:09,284 --> 00:26:19,827
Number three, we have suspension discipline report, assistant superintendent of secondary education, Dr. Peter J. Cushing will report on the status of discipline and detail a demographic breakdown of the district.

245
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:20,627
Dr. Cushing.

246
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:22,489
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

247
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:23,991
Good evening, members of the school committee.

248
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:29,718
Just want to provide a verbal update to the report that you have in your packet.

249
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:40,612
So the original motion asked for the planning and implementation that we had done to address the concerns of suspension and to reduce

250
00:26:41,432 --> 00:26:47,015
significantly and dramatically the number of suspensions that our students may have been subject to.

251
00:26:47,675 --> 00:27:00,401
So what we did was first last year in March of 2021, we had a seminar for all district administrators that was titled Properly Investigating Claims of Bullying and Harassment.

252
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:02,222
This was held over Zoom on March 31st.

253
00:27:03,983 --> 00:27:13,531
and it was to make sure that every single district and school administrator had the same understanding of how an investigation should be conducted.

254
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:28,806
While this was done primarily for bullying and harassment, it really was for any situation that may come up to make sure that the due process rights of students prior to discipline being imposed was undertaken.

255
00:27:30,286 --> 00:27:37,488
So they were trained in interview methods, understanding and following through on due process, as I said, and maintaining confidentiality.

256
00:27:38,088 --> 00:27:40,229
Second, Ms.

257
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:45,690
Galussi expanded responsive classroom to all elementary schools in the district.

258
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,732
Elementary staff have participated in the training for the implementation of this program.

259
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:56,454
Third action that we've done is a train the trainer model for two professional development modules.

260
00:27:56,974 --> 00:28:03,039
The first is understanding and addressing implicit unconscious bias in our schools and social emotional learning in the classroom.

261
00:28:03,819 --> 00:28:06,681
The former had 21 participants.

262
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:09,143
It was capped at 20, but we squeezed one in.

263
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:13,506
And then the other had about 17 participants.

264
00:28:14,087 --> 00:28:20,732
The first was a two day training that we have now delivered to every single staff member in the district.

265
00:28:21,252 --> 00:28:27,636
with the exception of our special education staff as they were engaged in another valuable professional development that day.

266
00:28:27,736 --> 00:28:31,058
And we will be following up further on the implicit bias.

267
00:28:32,619 --> 00:28:47,068
We also are facing, are deploying the social emotional learning in the classroom presently as an optional professional development being offered to staff on the three optional professional development days.

268
00:28:47,988 --> 00:28:53,350
Challenges are just a limited amount of professional development time with competing interests.

269
00:28:54,690 --> 00:29:15,216
And, you know, to think about deploying new curriculums, deploying various things that we have, as well as the continuing pandemic and people's bandwidth through these very challenging times, as I'm sure you've seen in the news media lately about the stress that teachers are under.

270
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:32,507
Future plans include the introduction of a restorative justice pilot that has already been done at the Andrews, and we have a plan in place to move forward with the pilot at both the McGlynn Middle School and Medford High School.

271
00:29:33,757 --> 00:29:39,862
and for us to offer that there as well, while a plan to continue at the Andrews is also in place.

272
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:47,489
We're also currently reviewing the responsive classroom model to see if that's something that we should carry forward in the middle school.

273
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:48,970
They have a middle school offering.

274
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:54,534
If all of our students are being offered this across the district at the elementary level,

275
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:58,458
then it would seem to be a natural progression.

276
00:29:59,259 --> 00:30:01,941
I say seem, because we're just starting to investigate it.

277
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:02,622
I have a meeting with Ms.

278
00:30:02,662 --> 00:30:07,847
Galussi and a representative later this week to start that conversation.

279
00:30:07,987 --> 00:30:16,395
But if our students are all being trained as they come up through, it would be a good natural progression for our teachers to understand where they're coming from and continue with the program.

280
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:27,224
And then while not in the report, we're also examining, this is something that was suggested by students in the many student seminar groups that we had.

281
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:36,352
Peer mediation had a conversation with a peer mediation training company that specializes in school peer mediation today.

282
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:45,660
And also looking at the climate and culture survey that was suggested by this group on December 6th.

283
00:30:47,959 --> 00:30:55,449
You have the specific numbers focused on secondary and happy to answer any questions you may have at this time.

284
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:01,257
Member McLaughlin.

285
00:31:02,255 --> 00:31:02,696
Thank you.

286
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:04,498
Thank you Dr. Cushing for this report.

287
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:11,867
I had just a couple of questions for the professional development training specific to the bullying and harassment.

288
00:31:12,888 --> 00:31:15,431
I know that you and I have met on this a number of times as well.

289
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:17,473
Is there going to be any training for

290
00:31:18,554 --> 00:31:22,775
families and community caregivers, I think you had mentioned that there might be something like that.

291
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:41,361
It will be, and we're trying to plan that and get that off the ground so that it will be an annual training offered at a district level for parents to come in to understand, number one, bullying versus conflict, and also the processes of bullying.

292
00:31:41,521 --> 00:31:46,443
I also know that the bullying policy has been referred back to the Rules, Policy, and Equity Committee,

293
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,546
And we'd be happy to discuss further our plans there.

294
00:31:50,146 --> 00:31:50,927
Great, thank you.

295
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:54,351
And then we had also talked about a flow chart.

296
00:31:54,831 --> 00:31:57,875
And I know that you and the Director of Pupil Services, Ms.

297
00:31:57,915 --> 00:32:06,244
Bowen, were working on something that was a visual aid, at least for families in the meantime, while, or families and caregivers in the meantime, while rules

298
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:09,726
subcommittee is working on some of the language.

299
00:32:09,766 --> 00:32:11,747
Is that available or can that be made available?

300
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:13,147
It can be made available.

301
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:16,808
Once again, though, it hasn't been officially adopted as part of the policy.

302
00:32:17,949 --> 00:32:21,430
So happy to share that out as a draft.

303
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:37,136
but would want to make sure that anything is, and anything as sensitive as the bullying policy is, would like to make sure that it's reviewed and approved by the committee prior to widespread distribution, but I can also understand the perspective.

304
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:40,337
That would be great if we could, sorry, Mayor.

305
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:47,113
That would be great if we could have a draft of that, if we could see that maybe for the next one, if it's already done.

306
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:47,534
Thank you.

307
00:32:48,634 --> 00:33:01,139
And then for the, I'm sorry, the restorative justice pilot that I know is going to be expanding from the Andrews to the McGlynn, you were saying, is that something that's observable?

308
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:02,580
Like, what does that look like?

309
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,402
And, you know, can a school committee member observe or somebody else observe what actually

310
00:33:08,552 --> 00:33:10,615
Is there a curriculum attached?

311
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:12,717
There's a very specific curriculum.

312
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:18,665
There are several companies, and I know Suffolk University does some really great work in this.

313
00:33:18,685 --> 00:33:19,706
Great.

314
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:22,329
Suffolk University was not involved at the Andrews.

315
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:23,491
It was another organization.

316
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:24,812
Just want to be clear about that.

317
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:39,247
What I think that the trainings could be viewed, I think that possibly the, not possibly, I think that the training materials could be viewed, but when restorative justice- Yeah, the process, yeah.

318
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:40,809
Yeah, we don't want the- No.

319
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:47,196
An outsider coming in to observe a restorative circle would really disrupt the process and the flow.

320
00:33:47,889 --> 00:33:48,109
Right.

321
00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:49,510
At least in my experience.

322
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:53,734
So if we want that information, we can reach out to you regarding, okay, great.

323
00:33:53,774 --> 00:33:58,297
I also have in my office, a 431 page book called Circle Forward.

324
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:05,403
And I forget who published it, but it's a spiral bound book that if you would like to come and take a look, feel free.

325
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:12,368
There's a great documentary too, called The Circle, all about restorative justice and something that was done in Boston Public Schools.

326
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:13,529
So happy to share that with you too.

327
00:34:13,569 --> 00:34:14,410
That would be one?

328
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:14,630
Yeah.

329
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,270
Great.

330
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:15,650
Thank you.

331
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,352
And then lastly, the data on the discipline.

332
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:25,116
Um, I know that we didn't ask for it, but I'm sure that it's being collected, um, demographics on this data.

333
00:34:25,716 --> 00:34:26,377
Yes, it is.

334
00:34:26,457 --> 00:34:30,839
It was not, I, I tried to stick as close to the resolution as possible.

335
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,902
Um, but yes, I mean, we can definitely provide demographics.

336
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:35,842
That would be great.

337
00:34:35,902 --> 00:34:38,184
And then can we also include elementary data?

338
00:34:38,344 --> 00:34:41,125
Cause I understand there have been some suspensions at the elementary level.

339
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:41,966
So

340
00:34:42,945 --> 00:34:44,687
I'd invite Ms.

341
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,769
Galussi to come up or if you just want me to.

342
00:34:48,650 --> 00:35:05,747
So we deliberately did not include data at the elementary level because there are two suspensions across the four schools and really giving any more data in a public meeting would not respect the privacy and the sensitivity of those students and families involved.

343
00:35:06,427 --> 00:35:08,348
And so through conversations with Ms.

344
00:35:08,368 --> 00:35:20,773
Galussi, we really felt that we needed to really provide you the data, but also to make sure that our students' privacy as they restore and they grow is protected.

345
00:35:21,177 --> 00:35:29,263
And that data definitely, according to Desi, as well as the case for special education, if the children are identifiable by the numbers because of the low numbers, we don't include that.

346
00:35:29,283 --> 00:35:31,464
So say under five or something like that, that makes sense.

347
00:35:32,065 --> 00:35:50,178
But could there be a process by which school committee is made aware of elementary school suspensions, which obviously are concerning, and especially with some of our very young students, it seems to me that we should know if that's the case, because it just seems that

348
00:35:50,678 --> 00:36:01,746
there's got to be some knowledge of that, especially because it is rare, but some understanding without knowing, obviously, who the students are at the school or anything like that.

349
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:07,831
But for example, if a first grader is suspended, I think the school committee should know.

350
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:13,815
So I don't actually know that that should be the case, to be honest, with all due respect.

351
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:18,498
The new laws and regulations that were passed a few years ago require that

352
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,803
any student under third grade, third grade or below, the superintendent needs to be immediately aware.

353
00:36:25,963 --> 00:36:33,227
However, I think reporting to school committee on each individual suspension as it occurs

354
00:36:34,588 --> 00:36:39,290
would not necessarily be in the greatest interest or good of the students.

355
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,451
With all due respect, but I want to give Ms.

356
00:36:41,471 --> 00:36:42,451
Galussi, I apologize.

357
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:48,993
I actually was going to say the same thing, but Dr. Cushing said it beautifully.

358
00:36:49,113 --> 00:36:54,355
I just want you to be also mindful that when situations like this do occur,

359
00:36:56,256 --> 00:37:08,955
we are notified and so the conversation then happens between myself and oftentimes Joan Bowen if it is a student as you have described that would be on an IEP even today.

360
00:37:11,238 --> 00:37:16,363
Bowen, Director of Approval Services, and myself had a meeting very similar at a school about this.

361
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:24,771
So it's definitely a conversation and things are definitely addressed between myself and the principal or the team.

362
00:37:26,032 --> 00:37:27,433
Documentation is reviewed.

363
00:37:28,194 --> 00:37:35,801
But I think that it is a very, as we're explaining to you here, I mean, it is February and out of four schools, we only have

364
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:38,142
to across the schools.

365
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:42,804
So it's very infrequent because other supports are in place at the schools.

366
00:37:43,244 --> 00:37:50,365
And so conversations are happening around the need for a suspension if that comes up.

367
00:37:51,026 --> 00:37:57,427
And a lot of them are really not the suspensions necessarily the way that you may be thinking.

368
00:37:57,507 --> 00:38:00,648
Some of them are more therapeutic in nature.

369
00:38:00,688 --> 00:38:04,589
And so I think the situations are very sensitive and

370
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,895
confidential and just handled at the school level with the support team that's in place.

371
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:13,322
Thank you.

372
00:38:13,762 --> 00:38:26,610
Yeah, I think my primary concern, and I can appreciate the privacy issue for sure, but my primary concern is obviously, you know, if the district is suspending first or second graders or kindergartners, I think that sends a message as well.

373
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:32,873
And I think it's really important that we're focused obviously on the social emotional learning and responsive classroom and all of those things.

374
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:35,275
So I don't obviously need to know the circumstances.

375
00:38:35,495 --> 00:38:42,139
I don't wanna know the circumstances, but I do think that it's valuable for, and I hear you saying that,

376
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:47,207
The school committee doesn't need to know because there are two incidents, for example, and I would agree with that.

377
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:53,838
But I do think if we get a call from a constituent or a family member or here in the community or other people here in the community,

378
00:38:54,471 --> 00:38:58,494
you know that 7, 8, 5, year-old is being suspended in our school district.

379
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:00,937
I think it really sends a message to our community as well.

380
00:39:01,457 --> 00:39:15,169
And so I don't know what the answer is to that, but I'm really hoping that we see zero at the elementary level, just because it seems like, you know, they're children and we should be really looking at restorative justice at the elementary level, if that's the case.

381
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:16,170
Thank you.

382
00:39:18,492 --> 00:39:18,872
Thank you.

383
00:39:19,352 --> 00:39:19,813
Member Hayes.

384
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,130
Hi, yes, thank you.

385
00:39:24,091 --> 00:39:39,212
I was curious about some of the classroom programs for social-emotional learning and wondering what kind of ongoing support there is for teachers as they try to implement some of these after the initial professional development.

386
00:39:41,018 --> 00:39:46,519
So the ongoing support would be any one of the trainers would be available to come and work with the teachers.

387
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:47,720
Ms.

388
00:39:47,760 --> 00:40:00,363
Schulman and her staff, counselors, building administrators, as well as building leaders, principals, assistant principals would be available to come in, conduct observations of student behavior.

389
00:40:00,883 --> 00:40:14,610
that would not be observations of the teacher per se, but could be observations of student behavior, student interactions, and also providing other research and evidence-based resources that would provide assistance.

390
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:20,472
Is that built in, or does the teacher have to come and ask for that if they want it?

391
00:40:21,513 --> 00:40:29,777
So the teacher would have to come and ask and say, hey, I need this assistance, or what more could you do to help me out with this?

392
00:40:30,634 --> 00:40:31,294
Okay, thank you.

393
00:40:32,395 --> 00:40:32,775
Thank you.

394
00:40:36,057 --> 00:40:38,478
Member Graham.

395
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:50,063
On the report that you provided, can you tell us what the difference between a detention and a one-hour detention and a two-hour detention and a three-hour detention is?

396
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:55,866
I was with you until the last one, two, three, and then just detention.

397
00:40:56,126 --> 00:40:57,347
What does that mean?

398
00:40:57,567 --> 00:41:06,011
So the report actually shows some work that we have to do in our student information management system to clean up various things.

399
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:14,994
And there are duplicate things, and the individual inputting the data may simply be using one input versus another input.

400
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:20,757
So on detentions, what I would say is that from detention specifically,

401
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:32,379
What I would say is that a student who receives an infraction has an infraction that requires two hours of detention would be an hour detention each day until that two hour detention is served.

402
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:36,735
So those would be that for the detention.

403
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:49,198
But if you notice detention and a one hour detention, I would say are probably the same, and we need to collapse some of these reporting categories to make sure that we capture things properly.

404
00:41:49,618 --> 00:41:54,999
I will say one of the things with student information management systems is you don't wanna collapse anything mid year.

405
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:01,381
So this would be some work that we did in the summertime, because then you would have to reenter the data

406
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:05,203
uh, cold to be able to make sure that it was properly captured.

407
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:13,027
And what is a level one suspension versus an out of school suspension versus an in-school suspension?

408
00:42:13,527 --> 00:42:17,149
So an in-school suspension is a suspension where the student is in school.

409
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:23,293
Um, they're probably working with a professional to assist them to get their work done.

410
00:42:24,053 --> 00:42:28,516
Um, but it's not an infraction that requires to be sent home.

411
00:42:29,036 --> 00:42:30,697
It's something that just requires removal.

412
00:42:30,817 --> 00:42:38,663
Now, I will say this, a suspension, whether in school or out of school is considered the same by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

413
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:45,527
But what this does is it allows for the student to be well supervised, supported, able to get work done.

414
00:42:46,368 --> 00:42:51,271
And while it counts the same, it does offer the student a little bit of support.

415
00:42:51,912 --> 00:42:54,834
The other thing about the level one suspensions,

416
00:42:55,374 --> 00:42:57,355
versus an out-of-school suspension.

417
00:42:57,455 --> 00:43:02,917
Once again, I think those are categories that we have to look at to make sure that our reporting is cleaner.

418
00:43:04,898 --> 00:43:16,783
The one thing I will say is that the suspensions having the one day, two day, three day allows for you to see a cleaner breakdown of the number of days a student would have been sent out for.

419
00:43:17,724 --> 00:43:20,265
The out-of-school suspensions are all one days.

420
00:43:21,112 --> 00:43:22,913
from my conversations with the principals.

421
00:43:24,613 --> 00:43:30,715
And again, like I said, it would just require a cleanup of our data recording categories.

422
00:43:32,335 --> 00:43:48,180
And I think the other thing that I'm interested in is understanding like if we are in the midst of a pilot at the Andrews, why are there more suspensions happening there than in any of the other schools?

423
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,361
So it doesn't, something isn't working.

424
00:43:50,883 --> 00:44:01,306
Well, I don't necessarily know if there's a corollary there or the incidents simply warranted that level of student discipline.

425
00:44:01,566 --> 00:44:08,828
And so what I can say is that after reviewing each and every one of these incidents, they

426
00:44:10,907 --> 00:44:29,276
or either physical violence or some type of speech or action that would fall into a category of racism or other type of speech or other type of action that is not permissible in a school setting.

427
00:44:29,316 --> 00:44:37,340
And so the restorative justice piece would continue with that discipline as the student reenters.

428
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:55,916
Okay, and then, do I recall correctly that this also is a subject for a future rules policy and equity subcommittee meeting, because I think you know it was my expectation that before this pot the change the policy went into place.

429
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:06,469
that you all were going to come back to us with a set of recommendations and just clarification so that we all knew what to expect and that didn't happen.

430
00:45:06,549 --> 00:45:07,951
So I think we still need to do that.

431
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:11,495
And I just want to make sure that is in fact on the list.

432
00:45:11,595 --> 00:45:18,282
Member Rousseau, is that part of the queue of rules, policy and equity meetings?

433
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:29,186
I don't have that in the list of things that are queued up in the rules subcommittee right now.

434
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:39,734
I do have the review of the rules of the bullying prevention, which we just went through, but I don't have the other...

435
00:45:40,682 --> 00:45:44,845
thing that you're mentioning, which does have some sounds vaguely familiar, to be honest.

436
00:45:46,066 --> 00:45:46,987
So I don't know.

437
00:45:47,087 --> 00:45:47,287
Sorry.

438
00:45:47,868 --> 00:45:48,628
Okay.

439
00:45:48,648 --> 00:46:06,122
So just for the sake of clarity, I'd like to make a motion that the rules, policy and equity subcommittee conduct a follow up meeting to have that discussion around what the restorative justice piloting looks like, what kind of outcomes we can expect.

440
00:46:06,775 --> 00:46:09,497
any clarifications that need to be made to the policy.

441
00:46:10,258 --> 00:46:24,790
And I think as importantly, what resources we need to authorize in the upcoming budget that will allow you all to execute the policy that we passed for implementation.

442
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:26,391
Second, we can't do that.

443
00:46:26,531 --> 00:46:27,632
We can't do that alone.

444
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:30,034
So we need you all to tell us what you need.

445
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,632
Motion for approval by member Graham seconded by member of our fun.

446
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:36,953
All those in favor.

447
00:46:36,973 --> 00:46:40,395
Thank you member case.

448
00:46:41,856 --> 00:46:44,978
If I can just add one thing about the all in favor of the troops.

449
00:46:48,935 --> 00:46:59,160
If I just add one thing about in speaking to various organizations, Suffolk University and others around restorative justice, this is not a quick fix.

450
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,482
Now, restorative justice is a four plus year rollout and implementation.

451
00:47:04,702 --> 00:47:16,368
So I do just want to let everybody know the pilot was run and is, I would say continuing in pilot phase at the Andrews, but it is, you're looking at a multi-year rollout.

452
00:47:16,868 --> 00:47:21,912
to make sure that these changes take hold that you know like a seedling it's fostered and allowed to grow.

453
00:47:23,033 --> 00:47:39,225
Yeah and I would totally anticipate that to be the case and if there are changes that we need to think about from a policy perspective to allow for that ramp then we should do that so we can talk about that at the subcommittee.

454
00:47:40,166 --> 00:47:40,486
Thank you.

455
00:47:41,086 --> 00:47:43,188
And then just from the chair if you don't mind Dr. Cushing

456
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:49,410
The professional development was in the training was back in March.

457
00:47:49,470 --> 00:48:02,267
Will there be another kind of update where you bring principals and vice principals together, maybe come this March to just see how things are going, review the data, make sure everything's being consistent and fair across the district?

458
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:04,647
So there was no plan to do that.

459
00:48:04,727 --> 00:48:16,395
I've been meeting with, uh, school and district administrators one-on-one to review their cases, to check, uh, the bullying reports as they come in to really look at, um, how they're doing with it.

460
00:48:17,016 --> 00:48:28,944
Um, but I think that's a good suggestion to bring everybody back together to also look at maybe a refresher, um, as well as we've hired some new people on board, um, to make sure that we're staying consistent.

461
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:30,065
Thank you.

462
00:48:34,437 --> 00:48:37,818
Next, we have number four, Hate Crimes Prevention Grant.

463
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:44,721
Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Education, Dr. Peter J. Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Elementary Education, Ms.

464
00:48:44,741 --> 00:48:48,963
Suzanne Galluzzi, and Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health, Ms.

465
00:48:48,983 --> 00:48:54,765
Stacey Schulman, will report on the district's application for DESE Hate Crimes Prevention Grant.

466
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:04,582
Good evening again.

467
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,043
Thank you for having us here.

468
00:49:08,123 --> 00:49:08,783
Ms.

469
00:49:09,264 --> 00:49:11,624
Shulman is online on our Zoom call.

470
00:49:12,265 --> 00:49:15,846
We're excited to announce that we applied for this grant.

471
00:49:17,186 --> 00:49:19,947
It was a very last minute grant that the state made us aware of.

472
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:22,008
and it was a competitive grant.

473
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:25,690
Each awardee was given a maximum of $50,000.

474
00:49:27,271 --> 00:49:31,274
We are very proud that the work that Mrs. Shulman, Ms.

475
00:49:31,294 --> 00:49:32,495
Galussi, and Ms.

476
00:49:32,535 --> 00:49:36,418
Bissell and myself did, we were able to get the maximum allowable.

477
00:49:37,538 --> 00:49:41,481
I would also say that the students of Medford High School helped drive

478
00:49:41,921 --> 00:49:58,575
the thought process behind the writing of this grant and the things that were brought before you on December 6th were a critical driving force that as soon as we heard of this grant, we're like, no, we need to immediately apply for this.

479
00:50:00,037 --> 00:50:00,617
And so,

480
00:50:02,218 --> 00:50:14,785
We're very happy to announce introduction of restorative justice pilot that I just mentioned is now being funded for $23,000 stipends for educators to participate in the training.

481
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:24,011
We allocated $12,000 and then contracted services for survey tools to be available for all staff, families, students, and community members.

482
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:33,554
surveys will help our district better understand the culture and climate of our schools and provide critical data to make recommendations and implement growth strategies.

483
00:50:34,834 --> 00:50:37,915
So wanted to make that aware to you.

484
00:50:38,355 --> 00:50:43,577
We'll also have some other grant information coming up in future meetings for things that we've applied for.

485
00:50:44,477 --> 00:50:48,298
And there's a slow trickle of information coming back to us.

486
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:51,659
Wonderful.

487
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:52,660
Congratulations.

488
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:53,680
Congratulations.

489
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,060
Great job.

490
00:50:55,621 --> 00:50:55,861
Thank you.

491
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:59,904
Mayor, member Graham, can I just ask a quick question?

492
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:01,606
Yes.

493
00:51:01,646 --> 00:51:13,235
The $15,000 for contracted services for survey tools, that is not meant to supplant the resolution about the climate and culture survey, is it?

494
00:51:13,495 --> 00:51:14,275
No, it is not.

495
00:51:14,516 --> 00:51:15,516
Perfect, thank you.

496
00:51:17,718 --> 00:51:18,038
Thank you.

497
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:25,204
Number seven, presentations of the public, not to begin before 7 p.m., we're good?

498
00:51:25,901 --> 00:51:33,366
Regular meetings of the school committee include this presentation of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

499
00:51:33,386 --> 00:51:36,128
A resident may only present once at any meeting.

500
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:43,053
These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

501
00:51:43,574 --> 00:51:51,500
If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

502
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,642
The details for submitting a presentation can be found within

503
00:51:55,311 --> 00:51:59,312
The policy BEDH, public comment and presentations of the public.

504
00:52:00,853 --> 00:52:10,176
Pursuant to policy BEDH, public comment and presentations of the public, any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

505
00:52:10,436 --> 00:52:13,477
The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

506
00:52:14,157 --> 00:52:18,838
The speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and full Memphis street address where they reside.

507
00:52:19,459 --> 00:52:23,800
A welcoming inclusive community is both the value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

508
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:27,373
We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

509
00:52:28,574 --> 00:52:33,598
Number eight, nine, we have eight continued business, which there is none.

510
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:38,322
Number nine, we have new business 2022-14 offered by member Rousseau, member Hayes, member Graham.

511
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:55,227
The Medford School Committee signs on to the letter authorized by the National Organization of Women in Support of an Act to increase access to disposable menstrual products in prisons, homeless shelters, and public schools.

512
00:52:56,388 --> 00:53:02,652
I am Bill S1445 slash H.2354.

513
00:53:03,653 --> 00:53:08,516
Further, the Secretary of the School Committee is authorized to complete the submission form indicating support.

514
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:12,852
Meeting date 2-7-2022.

515
00:53:12,992 --> 00:53:15,113
Submitted date 2-2-2022.

516
00:53:18,135 --> 00:53:20,016
Motion for approval or would somebody like to speak?

517
00:53:21,216 --> 00:53:21,957
Motion to approve.

518
00:53:22,077 --> 00:53:23,177
Motion to approve.

519
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:26,839
Seconded by member Russo.

520
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:32,943
Can I just ask a question before we call the roll?

521
00:53:36,607 --> 00:53:43,530
Is it any more explanation on what would be provided if this bill passes the state funded or be a funded mandate how.

522
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,471
Most important question that a good question.

523
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:49,592
Just curious.

524
00:53:50,492 --> 00:53:55,274
If I may remember so I believe that the legislation that requires there's funding.

525
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,035
And I also know that the

526
00:53:59,197 --> 00:54:06,478
Well, while we apparently have a law preventing us from having unfunded mandates, we also know they still come at us fast and furious.

527
00:54:06,578 --> 00:54:11,779
So yeah, but I understand that there's money expected to be allocated.

528
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:15,560
And actually there was money allocated for some of this this year already by Governor Baker.

529
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:17,720
Thank you very much.

530
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:18,940
Mayor, can I ask a question?

531
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,321
Member McLaughlin?

532
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:22,941
I just wonder, I know that the committees have reported out.

533
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:25,381
Does anyone know if this has been reported out favorably?

534
00:54:25,401 --> 00:54:28,202
Member Russo?

535
00:54:28,954 --> 00:54:31,475
The testimony on this, I believe, is happening next week.

536
00:54:32,016 --> 00:54:33,716
So it has not been reported out yet.

537
00:54:33,836 --> 00:54:38,619
And the idea is to get us on the list of people for that testimony.

538
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,021
Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Russo.

539
00:54:43,081 --> 00:54:43,901
All those in favor?

540
00:54:43,921 --> 00:54:44,962
Aye.

541
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:46,562
Thank you.

542
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:47,803
All those opposed?

543
00:54:47,823 --> 00:54:49,024
Sorry.

544
00:54:50,104 --> 00:54:50,824
Motion passes.

545
00:54:51,505 --> 00:54:57,287
Just as a follow up, I was just going to ask if you'll let us know when the testimony is, so that if we want to go on the Zoom hearing.

546
00:54:58,008 --> 00:54:58,308
Thank you.

547
00:54:59,043 --> 00:55:00,844
Great.

548
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:03,126
2022-16 offered by member Rousseau.

549
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:19,399
Policy DBEDB agenda creation format for regular meetings of the school committee will be amended by the insertion immediately following the regular meeting of the Memphis School Committee with the text on a new line.

550
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:24,323
We'll reset to one at the beginning of each calendar year.

551
00:55:24,883 --> 00:55:25,404
Member Rousseau.

552
00:55:26,747 --> 00:55:29,568
No, I have nothing to say unless anybody wants to talk about it.

553
00:55:30,788 --> 00:55:31,508
Motion to approve.

554
00:55:32,668 --> 00:55:33,068
Second.

555
00:55:34,788 --> 00:55:39,109
Motion by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

556
00:55:39,149 --> 00:55:39,949
All those in favor?

557
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:40,950
Aye.

558
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:41,830
Aye.

559
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:44,730
Aye.

560
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:49,451
Paper passes.

561
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:53,912
2022-17, offered by Member McLaughlin and Member McStone, out-of-district communication.

562
00:55:54,615 --> 00:56:22,626
Whereas several Medford public school students are in out-of-district placements, and whereas students in our district placements are Medford public school students first and foremost, be it resolved, Medford out-of-district students and families receive the same communication as in-district students, including notification of school cancellation, robocalls, access to school brains, or other equal opportunity platforms, information on afterschool program, in-school events, dances, flyers, clubs, et cetera.

563
00:56:23,705 --> 00:56:44,709
We had further resolved that a one-page FAQ, Frequently Asked Questions, be created and published on school and district websites for our Out-of-School District students and families, and that school principals receive active lists in September and during the year as required with Out-of-District student contact information for their respective schools.

564
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:48,050
Motion for approval.

565
00:56:51,335 --> 00:56:57,020
by member Stone, seconded by member McLaughlin, member Graham.

566
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:58,702
Just a quick question.

567
00:56:58,822 --> 00:57:08,631
I wondered if we might make a friendly amendment asking that we inquire what family's preferences are, because I don't think

568
00:57:09,692 --> 00:57:29,186
all families are the same in terms of what their level of interest is and I would hate to sort of meet the need that some members of our community are really asking for quite consistently and then sort of make it worse for other families who are just sort of happy with the way things are for their own reasons.

569
00:57:29,266 --> 00:57:30,867
So I know we don't have

570
00:57:32,008 --> 00:57:42,714
tons of out of district students, and it seems reasonable to amend this, to just ask what their preferences are on an annual basis so that we can honor those.

571
00:57:43,114 --> 00:57:44,034
Member McLaughlin.

572
00:57:44,535 --> 00:57:44,795
Yes.

573
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:48,337
So I would say generally that that would be fine.

574
00:57:48,497 --> 00:57:54,620
It's just that I also want to ensure that the principals are getting the list of who the families are.

575
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:55,901
So that was part of it.

576
00:57:55,981 --> 00:57:59,603
So specifically to receive the same communication, I would take that.

577
00:58:00,776 --> 00:58:12,955
friendly amendment, receive the same communication as in-district students, blah, blah, blah, flyers, clubs, et cetera, with an annual check-in to ensure families want that information.

578
00:58:13,483 --> 00:58:14,604
or something to that degree.

579
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:22,350
But I want to ensure that, you know, the earlier stuff about the, I mean, the latter stuff about the principal is getting a list and that whole thing.

580
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:31,136
And the frequently asked questions are not dependent upon families because the student, the principals still need to be aware of their out of district students.

581
00:58:34,279 --> 00:58:42,124
So in summary, I would say that the motion, the friendly amendment for receiving communication based on family,

582
00:58:44,162 --> 00:58:49,025
consent, I guess we could say, would be fine with me, if that's amenable for amendment.

583
00:58:50,866 --> 00:58:56,010
Okay, so motion to approve with that amendment.

584
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:00,373
Motion for approval, seconded by Member McLaughlin as amended.

585
00:59:00,653 --> 00:59:01,493
All those in favor?

586
00:59:02,374 --> 00:59:02,474
Aye.

587
00:59:03,695 --> 00:59:04,535
All those opposed?

588
00:59:05,076 --> 00:59:09,198
Paper passes.

589
00:59:09,218 --> 00:59:13,181
2022-18, offered by Member McLaughlin, School Committee Policies.

590
00:59:16,083 --> 00:59:41,022
Whereas the role of the Medford School Committee is to hire and evaluate the superintendent, approve and monitor the annual budget, write and maintain policies that guide the district, and the community should be aware of policies and procedures set forth by the school committee, be it resolved that the school committee policies, procedures, and rules will be posted publicly on the school district website and sent in electronic form to each school committee member beginning January of each year.

591
00:59:43,304 --> 00:59:56,648
Any policy changes will be updated in the website within one month of the change and provided in writing form, in written form to school committee members upon approval by the school committee as a whole.

592
00:59:57,168 --> 00:59:57,908
Member McLaughlin.

593
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:00,589
Thank you, Mayor.

594
01:00:00,649 --> 01:00:04,210
This is to my colleagues, this is really about

595
01:00:05,209 --> 01:00:17,452
keeping folks informed around the school committee's policy procedures and rules, and making sure that they're accessible on the website, accessible to the community, and accessible to new committee members and others.

596
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:33,097
So it was essentially to be sure that we're keeping some updated record of the policies, procedures, and rules on at least a monthly basis so that the community knows what our policies, procedures, and rules are, as well as the school committee members.

597
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:37,093
Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by?

598
01:00:37,493 --> 01:00:38,955
Mayor, I just had a quick question.

599
01:00:38,975 --> 01:00:40,336
Yep, Member Graham.

600
01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:47,043
We have a paid policy service through MASC where all of our policies live.

601
01:00:49,586 --> 01:00:53,831
I don't know if the superintendent knows, there is a link on our website, is there not?

602
01:00:56,535 --> 01:01:06,049
Okay, so are you, I'm just seeking some clarification, are you asking to duplicate the information that is in the link or are we just wanting to make sure the link is easy to find?

603
01:01:07,298 --> 01:01:11,882
I want to make sure that the link is easy to find and that the policies in there are updated regularly.

604
01:01:11,962 --> 01:01:14,744
So when I was looking for the link the other day, I could not find it.

605
01:01:15,225 --> 01:01:19,568
I actually had to go through a link from one of our memos to be able to hyperlink to it.

606
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:23,071
I did not see an easily accessible link on the website.

607
01:01:23,572 --> 01:01:30,137
So, and I also find obviously that the paid service from the NASC is very helpful for a lot of the policies.

608
01:01:30,177 --> 01:01:33,200
And I know there are some of these that we'll be working on both through the rules

609
01:01:34,633 --> 01:01:45,236
and Policy Subcommittee and through the committee as a whole, but I wanna make sure that they're accessible now and able to be read and up to date.

610
01:01:45,856 --> 01:01:46,537
So that's really it.

611
01:01:47,377 --> 01:01:47,777
Thank you.

612
01:01:51,118 --> 01:01:52,278
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

613
01:01:53,539 --> 01:01:54,379
Motion to approve.

614
01:01:54,779 --> 01:01:55,099
Second.

615
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:58,840
Motion to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

616
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,661
All those in favor?

617
01:01:59,681 --> 01:02:00,561
Aye.

618
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:02,241
All those opposed?

619
01:02:03,522 --> 01:02:04,182
Paper passes.

620
01:02:06,385 --> 01:02:12,348
2022-19 offered by member McLaughlin and member Hayes, school committee orientation.

621
01:02:13,949 --> 01:02:24,294
Whereas school committee members are elected every two years and whereas newly elected school committee members require training and orientation and reelected school committee members may require refresher orientation.

622
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:30,337
And whereas there's currently no locally identified orientation process, pamphlet or training

623
01:02:30,972 --> 01:02:48,542
for municipal school committee members, be it resolved the member school committee members receive orientation annually in January of each year to include parliamentary procedure, school committee policy handbook, ethics training, executive committee training and requirements, legal consultation, et cetera.

624
01:02:55,986 --> 01:02:56,387
Member Graham.

625
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:01,771
I was wondering if- Actually, I was just gonna see if we could speak to it first, sorry.

626
01:03:02,232 --> 01:03:03,393
May we speak to it, Mayor?

627
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:05,254
The motion?

628
01:03:05,354 --> 01:03:06,355
Will you yield, Member Graham?

629
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:07,336
Sure.

630
01:03:07,696 --> 01:03:08,276
Is that okay?

631
01:03:08,316 --> 01:03:16,482
Sorry, I just wanna make sure that everybody understands the intent of the motion as well, is that some of these things are currently happening.

632
01:03:16,903 --> 01:03:19,465
So there is an ethics training that we do online.

633
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:21,306
There is often an MASC training.

634
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:29,853
or there was one that I did in the first term, and I'm assuming that happens regularly for other folks.

635
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:33,776
It's not happening in January, obviously, or even before for new members.

636
01:03:34,236 --> 01:03:48,387
But our policy, current policy also has this as policy BIA, where the school committee and superintendent will assist each new member to understand the committee's functions, policies, and procedures of the committee.

637
01:03:49,007 --> 01:03:50,688
as soon after election as possible.

638
01:03:51,148 --> 01:04:03,734
Each new member shall be given the following materials, a copy of the school committee policy manual, a copy of the open meeting law, a copy of the conflict of interest regulations, a copy of the district's budget, collective bargaining agreements and contracts, student and staff handbooks.

639
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:09,657
So there's actually more in our policy than what is in this school committee orientation motion.

640
01:04:10,197 --> 01:04:14,299
So I would ask that we include what's in the policy in the motion as well.

641
01:04:15,284 --> 01:04:19,267
And just that ensuring that this is happening and being scheduled is what the motion is.

642
01:04:19,307 --> 01:04:26,291
So it's really just putting a schedule to the policy that currently exists for orientation of school committee members.

643
01:04:26,411 --> 01:04:32,055
And if member Hayes obviously would like to speak on this, mayor, I just wanted to offer that opportunity as well.

644
01:04:36,738 --> 01:04:38,879
I don't have much to add.

645
01:04:38,939 --> 01:04:42,201
I do appreciate that member McLaughlin brought this and asked me to

646
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:43,921
sponsor it with her.

647
01:04:43,941 --> 01:04:52,627
I think it's, as a new member, this would be great to have, certainly when you're first starting, because information is coming at me from different places.

648
01:04:52,647 --> 01:04:57,250
It would be nice to have it all coming at the same time from the same place.

649
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:06,636
Also, I think it's just kind of a nice way to start the year off as a group, as a team, if we're all starting off with the same orientations at the same time and

650
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,341
kind of have an opportunity to discuss them together and go over them together.

651
01:05:11,361 --> 01:05:12,861
I think it'd be a nice way to start the year.

652
01:05:14,382 --> 01:05:16,622
Thank you, member Hayes and member McLaughlin, member Graham.

653
01:05:18,202 --> 01:05:18,683
Thank you.

654
01:05:18,923 --> 01:05:36,807
So what I was saying earlier is that I was wondering if it made sense to take this up a little bit more specifically in our rules, in our rules meeting, because this does seem like a rule more than it is a policy, despite it being in our policy book right now.

655
01:05:37,908 --> 01:05:48,676
I also think Mass General Law has something very specific to say about orientation and does place the requirement of orientation for school committee members on the MASC.

656
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:56,503
So I wanna make sure that nothing that we write says that that doesn't exist because I think Mass General Law is clear on where that sits.

657
01:05:57,183 --> 01:06:14,066
I also think there's other components that would be really valuable that I certainly didn't receive any like formal training on around parliamentary procedure and they're really interesting and expensive online options that we might want to pursue and offer to new members.

658
01:06:15,527 --> 01:06:30,671
So I just think there's a lot of good stuff here that belongs in our rules book and perhaps we should move this to that meeting so that we can go through those details and make sure that we're consistent with the law, MASC, et cetera.

659
01:06:32,711 --> 01:06:32,972
Mayor?

660
01:06:33,372 --> 01:06:34,072
Member McLaughlin?

661
01:06:35,132 --> 01:06:43,720
I appreciate member Graham's mentioning the need that's in here because there are several and especially as new members from the last term.

662
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:45,582
I think we can identify with that.

663
01:06:47,064 --> 01:06:55,472
And I would say I guess my only concern with this being part of the rules committee of the whole meeting that we're having is again this body has not defined

664
01:06:56,223 --> 01:06:58,345
what they see as rules and what they see as policy.

665
01:06:58,385 --> 01:07:04,872
We have a current existing policy around making sure that the school committee orientation happens, which we just said was BIA.

666
01:07:04,893 --> 01:07:10,979
And now we're saying that this should be moved to the rules meeting to make it a rule as opposed to a policy.

667
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:13,802
And again, to be clear around the policy manual,

668
01:07:15,185 --> 01:07:25,614
our current policy manual says that if we're gonna make a change to policy, we have to put it on our schedule as a policy change so that the community has input and that we are able to have the discussion.

669
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,497
So again, I don't know the difference here.

670
01:07:28,577 --> 01:07:41,909
I'm trying to help me understand the difference you guys are understanding between rules and policy and whether we're superseding the current policy that says to have a policy change, we have to put it on the agenda, not at a committee of the whole rules meeting.

671
01:07:48,993 --> 01:07:54,779
I guess my take is we should not sunset this policy, which we can't do.

672
01:07:55,693 --> 01:08:04,960
really make a change to tonight wholesale anyway, because of our policies prevent that, but, um, we shouldn't do it until we have a rule in place that sort of governs that.

673
01:08:05,061 --> 01:08:12,226
And then we would take the policy through a process of, um, being what's the word repealed.

674
01:08:13,147 --> 01:08:18,671
So, but I, I don't think it's worth repealing it when the rules haven't been addressed.

675
01:08:18,872 --> 01:08:22,775
And I think all of that needs to be stepped out once we get through the rules document.

676
01:08:24,136 --> 01:08:24,356
Okay.

677
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:32,787
I would agree with that, and we can have a conversation in the rules committee of the whole then about the policy for changing the policy after we make a rule.

678
01:08:33,747 --> 01:08:34,208
Thank you.

679
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:35,409
I'll rescind the motion.

680
01:08:35,429 --> 01:08:52,243
Okay, so motion, and then I had a question about the annual part of it, where although if it's an email with links to the ethics training and Robert's Rules of Order, things like that, I think that would be fine to get every year.

681
01:08:54,130 --> 01:09:06,496
know if it's annually needed but a motion is to move this to rules policy subcommittee to review on the 16th to our committee of the whole 16th.

682
01:09:10,659 --> 01:09:15,921
And again, since this is coauthored with member Hayes, I just wanna make sure that obviously she's in agreement.

683
01:09:15,961 --> 01:09:20,044
I know we'll take a roll but I'm fine with that.

684
01:09:20,064 --> 01:09:22,725
Okay, motion to send this to our

685
01:09:23,808 --> 01:09:27,071
rules and policy meeting on the 16th, 4 to 6 p.m.

686
01:09:27,431 --> 01:09:27,831
Second.

687
01:09:27,991 --> 01:09:29,152
Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

688
01:09:29,172 --> 01:09:29,973
All those in favor?

689
01:09:30,293 --> 01:09:30,654
Aye.

690
01:09:31,935 --> 01:09:32,735
All those opposed?

691
01:09:33,096 --> 01:09:35,157
Paper passes.

692
01:09:35,177 --> 01:09:38,280
2022-20 submitted by Member McLaughlin and Member Kratz.

693
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,401
Budget schedule.

694
01:09:39,881 --> 01:09:45,406
Whereas the school committee unanimously voted to move the budget schedule up from April commencing in January 2022 via a motion on 11-15-2022.

695
01:09:48,963 --> 01:09:57,168
put forth by Member McLaughlin, Member Rousseau, be it resolved the budget process and schedule be created and posted publicly for the community and school committee members by 2-10-2022.

696
01:09:57,248 --> 01:09:58,289
Thank you.

697
01:09:58,309 --> 01:10:01,751
May I now?

698
01:10:02,111 --> 01:10:03,052
Member McLaughlin.

699
01:10:04,322 --> 01:10:10,686
There was two things that I was looking at in policy around this that I just wanted to bring to my colleagues attention as well.

700
01:10:10,726 --> 01:10:15,329
And so one is, you know, the fiscal management goals policy, which is the DA.

701
01:10:15,349 --> 01:10:29,357
And the first part of the fiscal management goals policy is that we engage in thorough advanced planning with staff and community involvement in order to develop budgets and to guide expenditures so as to achieve the greatest educational returns and the greatest contributions.

702
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:35,336
So, you know, I do feel like this is our fiscal responsibility to put a schedule forward.

703
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:48,085
And I know that assistant superintendent Murphy was talking about a process and sort of having a different process than what we've had in the past, which is understandable as well.

704
01:10:48,726 --> 01:10:57,572
But I do think we need to be able to lay out what that process is and how we're scheduling that so that the community can be involved in knowing what that is.

705
01:10:58,172 --> 01:11:22,266
And so the original motion that was approved was, whereas Medford Public Schools has historically conducted the annual budgeting process commencing in April and concluding in June, whereas there's a substantive increase in COVID-related funding for FY2022, whereas hiring practices in many districts are finalized by March-April, be it resolved the Medford Public Schools budgeting process commence in January and conclude in March,

706
01:11:22,757 --> 01:11:25,840
with budget recommendations presented to the city council in March.

707
01:11:27,041 --> 01:11:27,882
So that was the budget.

708
01:11:28,002 --> 01:11:31,565
I mean, that was approved on 11.8 by this body.

709
01:11:32,707 --> 01:11:38,352
And then I just wanna, again, defer to my colleague, member Kretz, if she wants.

710
01:11:39,994 --> 01:11:40,894
Yes, thank you.

711
01:11:41,725 --> 01:11:41,905
Yep.

712
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:43,186
So everything that Ms.

713
01:11:43,206 --> 01:11:55,837
McLaughlin said, and, um, yes, um, having the schedule, um, you know, what we've done in the past is we've all been made aware of the dates, you know, and the timeline so that we know what to expect.

714
01:11:56,617 --> 01:12:07,006
Um, and it's important that we get that information posted, you know, so that the community can also be made aware and, you know, when the dates are, so they're, you know, wondering what meetings they want to attend.

715
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:10,909
if they'll be made available on Zoom.

716
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:24,198
If the 10th is too soon, Mr. Murphy, if you think you need some more time, if 210 is a little bit too soon, could you let us know?

717
01:12:24,898 --> 01:12:36,026
I was gonna ask for an extension, at least if we could have it pushed back until the 16th and see if we can come up with dates by then.

718
01:12:37,442 --> 01:12:38,366
I'm amenable to that.

719
01:12:38,446 --> 01:12:40,093
Mr. Murphy, if you want to come forward, come.

720
01:12:51,655 --> 01:12:59,521
This is just to set up a schedule to share with the school committee members of the dates that we'll be meeting.

721
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:02,223
So I asked for a week to push it out.

722
01:13:02,243 --> 01:13:18,696
I think consistent with the amendment that was applied to and passed on November 15th and consistent with our conversation at the last school committee meeting, I think establishing that timeline is a perfectly reasonable request and we'd be happy to do it.

723
01:13:19,265 --> 01:13:29,668
I'm the remainder of the conversation just to be candid, I'm fairly confused by, but with regard to the timeline, I think we could certainly adhere to publishing that by February 16th.

724
01:13:30,408 --> 01:13:35,249
I think I wouldn't have a problem if it was a few days earlier, but yeah, sure.

725
01:13:35,549 --> 01:13:36,089
That sounds great.

726
01:13:37,129 --> 01:13:37,469
Thank you.

727
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:38,790
Motion to approve.

728
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:40,110
Second.

729
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:43,251
Motion to approve with a double second.

730
01:13:43,331 --> 01:13:44,271
All those in favor.

731
01:13:44,591 --> 01:13:44,731
Aye.

732
01:13:45,091 --> 01:13:45,411
Aye.

733
01:13:46,572 --> 01:13:47,492
All those opposed.

734
01:13:49,337 --> 01:13:50,097
Motion is passed.

735
01:13:50,697 --> 01:13:53,418
There are no reports requested under number 10.

736
01:13:56,239 --> 01:14:00,100
Number 11, we do have a few condolences.

737
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:10,243
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Carol A. De La Russo Kelly, daughter of the late former mayor, Arthur De La Russo.

738
01:14:10,263 --> 01:14:18,485
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Veronica Ronnie Lennox Quattaro.

739
01:14:19,653 --> 01:14:27,456
aunt of the former mayor, Michael J. McGlynn and great great aunt of Eleanor Brady O'Leary, fifth grade teacher at the Brooks Elementary School.

740
01:14:28,977 --> 01:14:40,142
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of John Pancho Webb, a standout athlete at Medford High School who earned nine varsity letters and is a member of the Mustang Hall of Fame.
