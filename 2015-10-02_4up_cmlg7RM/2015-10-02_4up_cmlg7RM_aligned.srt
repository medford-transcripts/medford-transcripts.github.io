1
00:00:00,428 --> 00:00:03,829
Hey guys, did you hear about the girls that did the Jimmy Fun walk for cancer?

2
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:05,209
No, I didn't actually.

3
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:06,029
That's really cool.

4
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:08,510
Mr. Heining is training for a marathon.

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,270
Did you guys hear about that?

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,670
Oh wow, I didn't hear about that either.

7
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,011
But I did talk to Mr. Scary.

8
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:13,591
He's the new coach for the basketball team.

9
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:14,731
Looks like a good season.

10
00:00:15,392 --> 00:00:18,492
Did you hear about the motorcycle run for Crystal Campbell?

11
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:21,093
No, I didn't, but that sounds really interesting.

12
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:23,734
Oh, guys, I'm on the volleyball team.

13
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,034
We finally won a game.

14
00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:25,754
Nice.

15
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:27,254
Did you guys go to the parade?

16
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:28,395
I was there interviewing.

17
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:29,535
It was pretty cool.

18
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:31,146
You guys want to know a joke?

19
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:31,927
Sure.

20
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,710
Where do fat cows go on vacation?

21
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,131
Where?

22
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:35,412
New York.

23
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:38,477
Do you guys remember that time we went to New York?

24
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:39,558
Oh yeah.

25
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:41,321
That was fun.

26
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,744
Live from New York, it's the Mustang Report!

27
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:49,889
I'm Victoria Rasher here with Brie Forcier at the 385th Medford Parade.

28
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:50,970
How are you today, Brie?

29
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,770
Good, how are you?

30
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,771
I'm great, thanks.

31
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:57,994
Did you know that this is the first parade in eight years in Medford?

32
00:00:58,354 --> 00:00:58,835
I did.

33
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:00,936
So are you excited to be walking in this parade?

34
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:02,057
I'm very excited.

35
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,139
Who are you walking with during this parade?

36
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,460
I'm walking with all the lacrosse girls in Galoosie.

37
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:11,123
So what's the thing that you're most excited to see?

38
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:13,544
I'm actually very excited to see everybody dressed up.

39
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:14,145
It's pretty cool.

40
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:15,445
Thanks, Marie.

41
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:16,405
Have fun at the parade.

42
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:17,285
Thanks, you too.

43
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:24,767
I'm Victoria Rasche here at the 385th Medford Parade with Mr. Galussi and these two lovely ladies.

44
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:25,947
Who are these two lovely ladies?

45
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:28,527
These are my daughters, Olivia and Sophia.

46
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,147
Hello.

47
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:31,768
We're here today, you know, to come out for the parade.

48
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:33,488
We always love a good parade.

49
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:37,609
We've got the lacrosse team, a bunch of other sports teams, swim team, crew team.

50
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:39,329
So we're all here to support the mayor.

51
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,669
He's been very good to all of us, kind of his last hurrah.

52
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,710
And say hi to Medford.

53
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,490
It should be a great day.

54
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:45,621
That's great, guys.

55
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:46,962
What are you guys looking forward to the most?

56
00:01:49,084 --> 00:01:50,085
Being in a parade.

57
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:53,167
I'm excited to be in the parade.

58
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:53,988
That's great.

59
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:54,528
Thank you, guys.

60
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:55,529
I hope you guys have a lot of fun.

61
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:56,070
Thanks so much.

62
00:01:58,672 --> 00:02:01,454
Hi, I'm Katrina Rasche, and I'm here with the Medford hockey team.

63
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:03,395
Hey!

64
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:05,357
Are you guys excited for the parade?

65
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:06,918
Yeah!

66
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:11,382
OK, so when does your hockey season start?

67
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:13,202
I don't know.

68
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:14,463
It already started.

69
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:17,326
You guys win any games yet?

70
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,368
You won two games.

71
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:20,128
Who got the goals?

72
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:27,155
What are you guys looking forward to most for the parade today?

73
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:30,438
Not walking?

74
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,059
No.

75
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:34,643
Are you guys gonna skate the parade?

76
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:35,864
Yeah.

77
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:36,785
Wear your ice skates.

78
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:42,327
These are our skates!

79
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:43,347
They're your skates?

80
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:43,887
Okay.

81
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:46,728
Well good luck today guys, walking the parade.

82
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:48,368
Wave to us if we're on the sideline, alright?

83
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,509
Now say bye to Medford.

84
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:56,131
Bye world!

85
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:01,132
I'm Victoria Rasher here at the 385th Medford Parade with Mickey and Minnie.

86
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:01,993
How are you guys today?

87
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:02,653
Pretty good.

88
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:03,678
Good.

89
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,319
What are you looking forward to most for this 385th parade?

90
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,060
Seeing all the little kids, seeing their excitement.

91
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,261
Have you had a lot of little kids come up to you?

92
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,142
A ton, actually.

93
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:15,262
I held a baby today.

94
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,003
That's exciting.

95
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:19,584
So what does it take to prep to be Mickey and Minnie?

96
00:03:20,684 --> 00:03:21,964
A lot of practice walking.

97
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,645
You've got to really see, look at your steps.

98
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:26,746
Are the heads heavy?

99
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:31,388
No, they're actually really light, but they're really big, so walking around is kind of tough.

100
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:33,816
That's exciting.

101
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:35,898
Well, have fun today, guys.

102
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:37,679
I hope you attract a lot of little kids.

103
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,600
Thank you.

104
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,260
You're welcome.

105
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:47,566
I'm Victoria Rasche here at the 385th Medford Parade, and I'm here with Sean Freeman, the boys' crew captain, and Nev Jacks, the girls' crew captain.

106
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:48,527
So how are you guys doing today?

107
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,427
Doing well.

108
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:49,828
How about you?

109
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:50,648
I'm great, thanks.

110
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:51,049
How about you?

111
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:51,849
I'm awesome.

112
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:52,349
How are you?

113
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,230
Good, thanks.

114
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,512
So what are you guys looking forward to most for the parade?

115
00:03:57,093 --> 00:04:01,556
I think representing the crew team and what we've done and showing our Medford spirit.

116
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:02,477
That's great.

117
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:02,837
How about you?

118
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:10,022
Yeah, pretty much the same thing, just showing how much we've grown and how well we've done in the past seasons and what a future we're looking forward to.

119
00:04:10,522 --> 00:04:15,266
So does this kind of half a mile walk, does it count as a practice for you guys today?

120
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:21,430
No, we usually don't practice on Sundays, but it's nothing near what a practice would be for us.

121
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,311
Our practice is like super hard.

122
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:27,634
Practices, they're definitely intense and they're like working our team and

123
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:29,322
Yeah.

124
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:35,104
If you had, Sean, one word to describe your amazing crew team, what would it be?

125
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:36,224
Committed.

126
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:38,985
What about you, Neve?

127
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:40,325
Commitment, yeah.

128
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:41,586
And team spirit.

129
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:42,606
Yeah, commitment.

130
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:44,727
Nice one.

131
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:45,467
Thanks, guys.

132
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:46,067
Have fun today.

133
00:04:47,894 --> 00:04:49,295
So when did your swim season start?

134
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:56,498
We're going to have an informational meeting on Wednesday, October 14th, but the season doesn't start until the Monday after Thanksgiving.

135
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:59,519
So I know there have been rumors about your 4 a.m.

136
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:00,120
practices.

137
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,320
When do you guys practice?

138
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:03,281
So it's just a rumor.

139
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:06,023
We do practice like every other team after school now.

140
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:08,844
We don't do morning practices.

141
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,599
And we have an amazing new facility.

142
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,341
It's one of the best high school facilities in the state.

143
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,863
So it's a really great opportunity to be swimming for Medford High.

144
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:20,425
So do you have to be a really good swimmer to try out for the swim team?

145
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:24,709
Honestly, you just need to have the motivation to become a good swimmer.

146
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:25,950
That's great.

147
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,930
All right.

148
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:27,611
Thanks, guys.

149
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:29,433
Hopefully, everyone else tries out for the swim team.

150
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:30,814
I won't, because I'll drown.

151
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:31,634
But thanks.

152
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:35,966
Hi, I'm Cariann Lucharis and I'm with the Mustang Report.

153
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:39,227
I'm here checking out the weather all around the school.

154
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:42,729
We're supposed to get a flash flood warning, three to six inches of rain.

155
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:45,391
Right now it's humid outside and be safe.

156
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:53,335
Hi, I'm Katrina Rasche and I'm here with the Mustang Report and we're here with Mr. Heineck from the English Department and he's training to run a marathon.

157
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:55,376
So Mr. Heineck, how do you train to run a marathon?

158
00:05:55,971 --> 00:06:06,744
So what a lot of people do is you download an 18-week training schedule and the first 15 weeks basically increase the amount you run.

159
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:11,329
Mainly on the weekends it's basically designed for people who have jobs.

160
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:15,134
So during the week you're running four or five days and then on the weekend you gradually do

161
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:20,116
A little bit more, a little bit more, starting around six or seven, and then it gets all the way up to 20.

162
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:27,541
And to get technical, what it does is you do, say, seven, then eight, and then you go, the third week is like five.

163
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:30,023
And then it goes 10, 11, and then it goes to eight.

164
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,105
And sort of you move forward, and then you move back, and your body acclimates to doing more work.

165
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:37,628
So are you taking 18 weeks to train?

166
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,098
I'm doing the whole thing exactly as prescribed.

167
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,118
I'm doing my homework.

168
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:52,160
And this way, if I follow it, I'm putting my trust in the experience of a guy named Hal Higdon, who wrote a book called The Marathon.

169
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,781
And the guy's in his 70s.

170
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,822
And when he turned 70, he ran seven marathons in seven months.

171
00:06:58,702 --> 00:06:59,222
So he's run over 100.

172
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:03,243
And so he's sort of like the official marathon guide.

173
00:07:03,343 --> 00:07:04,643
So I'm just sort of following along.

174
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:07,764
So would you want to run over 100 marathons?

175
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:09,826
No.

176
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,448
No, not at all.

177
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,670
All I really want to do is do better than I did last time.

178
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,352
I ran one when I was turning 40, like a bucket list thing.

179
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:20,795
And it went well for about 18 miles, and then it was terrible.

180
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:28,141
So this time I decided to sort of train more thoroughly, be better prepared, and eat.

181
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:31,564
Because the first time I didn't eat while I was doing it, and so I ran out of energy.

182
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:33,446
And now I know you've got to eat while you're running.

183
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,442
Hey!

184
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:37,022
Hi, I'm Carrie Anne and I'm back with the Mustang Report.

185
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,463
We're outside 3rd Cap.

186
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:41,244
I'm here with Lydia Ryan who's an expert on flash flooding.

187
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,585
Lydia, what do you think about all this flooding?

188
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:52,050
Well, there is a collapsed drain pipe on the roof and it's caved in about 30 feet down from the roof and they can't find it yet.

189
00:08:52,430 --> 00:09:02,855
However, it's causing leaking to come down from the ceiling and cause major flooding problems and we had a bunch of puddles here but they seem to have cleaned up and now they put giant trash bins here

190
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:05,176
to collect the rain from coming down from the roof.

191
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:08,319
Do you have any advice for the students that are going to be walking by here?

192
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,100
Don't walk under the rain.

193
00:09:11,261 --> 00:09:11,641
Thank you.

194
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:12,441
Back to you.

195
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:15,784
I'm here with Dr. Perrella, the initiator of the What Would Tucci Do?

196
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,585
So, can you tell me the information about What Would Tucci Do?

197
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:20,347
Sure, absolutely.

198
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,449
Actually, I don't think I could take full credit for What Would Tucci Do?

199
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:23,909
initiative.

200
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:28,392
Although, WTTD project, as we like to call it,

201
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:37,483
My wife and I, who was also a big fan of Mr. Tucci, were talking about how the man is amazing and seems to cure and fix every problem that there is.

202
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:41,505
So we sort of came up with that slogan, what would Tucci do?

203
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:48,607
And then it somehow materialized onto a t-shirt and I was fortunate enough to find them in a box and I just passed them out to random seniors.

204
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,128
That's sort of how it played out.

205
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:51,768
That's amazing.

206
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:55,950
So if you got a stain on your tie, what would Tucci do for you?

207
00:09:56,552 --> 00:10:05,800
Well, the first thing he'd probably do is he'd be the first person to identify the stain in the tie and tell me where it came from and how it probably can be fixed and resolved again.

208
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,864
He most likely would approach the tie carefully, maybe removing it from my neck without me even knowing it.

209
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:20,772
And at that point, somehow, between his language and the way he looks at the tie, the stain would sort of evaporate from the fabric.

210
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:24,815
That's how I would expect it to happen, though I haven't seen it yet happen like that.

211
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:26,362
Thank you, Dr. Perlow.

212
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:27,022
You're very welcome.

213
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,305
If there was a brand new building and there was an older lady on the top floor, what would Tucci do?

214
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:39,286
I think Mr. Tucci would go in and save the old lady's life.

215
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:40,666
Good answer.

216
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:45,248
What would Tucci do?

217
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:46,388
He would strike him off.

218
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,894
If there was a wing on the pool, what would Tootie do?

219
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,594
Um, he would definitely just cover the blowhole.

220
00:10:50,694 --> 00:10:52,135
Yeah, so would it damage the ceiling?

221
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:54,395
If there's an angel in distress, what would Tootie do?

222
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:58,137
Pick him up and spin him around.

223
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:00,237
If David Ortiz became a vampire, what would Tootie do?

224
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:01,938
Teach him how to play baseball!

225
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:07,180
If Tootie was in a dance battle, what would he do?

226
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,900
He would tap dance.

227
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:11,586
If Kanye West won for president in 2020, what would Tucci do?

228
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:12,647
We'd run against him!

229
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:13,507
Go Huggies!

230
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:14,128
Woo!

231
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:15,568
If it's your birthday, what would Tucci do?

232
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,870
Call you down to his office and tell you to run out and break the pencils.

233
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,391
If someone tried to assassinate the president and vice president, what would Tucci do?

234
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:22,412
Give him detention!

235
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:27,014
What would Tucci do?

236
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,675
What would he do?

237
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:29,175
Kyle!

238
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:30,856
Are you okay?

239
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:34,558
Thank you Mr. Tucci.

240
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,001
If there's a llama in the hallway, what would Tucci do?

241
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:42,423
He would get on it and ride it like Paul Revere!

242
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:43,264
Woo!

243
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:47,127
If there's a llama in the hallway, what would Tucci do?

244
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:48,308
Do you have a hall pass for that llama?

245
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:51,430
If somebody ran in late, but Mr. Tucci knew, what would Mr. Tucci do?

246
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,952
Deliver the baby in a snowstorm.

247
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:54,633
Exactly.

248
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:59,657
Hi, I'm here with Mr. Tucci, and we have to ask him about the what would Tucci do.

249
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:02,099
So, have you seen those shirts around the school?

250
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:13,583
I've seen them, I walked in this morning and I was totally taken aback and surprised and it's a good thing that got me thinking today on this Friday and it's fun to see people wearing the shirts.

251
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:18,786
So how do you feel about this what would Tucci do movement that's sweeping the school?

252
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:23,127
This is a movement but it's caused me to ponder the question too as well.

253
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:24,488
What would Tucci do?

254
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:28,677
And it's a very deep answer that I've been consulting a lot with Dr. Prowler about.

255
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:33,000
And him and I have been spending all day talking a little bit about what would Tucci do.

256
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:35,422
And he's kind of been my therapist today.

257
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:40,226
Okay, so I think we have to answer the question that all our viewers at home are wondering.

258
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:42,007
What would Tucci do?

259
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:44,052
What would Tucci do?

260
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:56,115
Well, it's a very deep question, like I said, but keep in mind that I am a person that loves Medford High School, in particular, the senior class.

261
00:12:56,895 --> 00:12:57,695
So what would I do?

262
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:00,496
I wanna see the senior class go on and graduate.

263
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:02,976
I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure that does happen.

264
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,016
So how's that for an answer?

265
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:05,617
That is an amazing answer.

266
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:06,737
Thank you so much.

267
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:07,557
Back to you.
