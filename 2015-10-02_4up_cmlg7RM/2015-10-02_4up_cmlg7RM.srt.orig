1
00:00:00,428 --> 00:00:03,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, did you hear about the girls that did the Jimmy Fun walk for cancer?

2
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:05,209
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't actually.

3
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:06,029
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.

4
00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:08,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Heining is training for a marathon.

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,270
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys hear about that?

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow, I didn't hear about that either.

7
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,011
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did talk to Mr. Scary.

8
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:13,591
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the new coach for the basketball team.

9
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:14,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like a good season.

10
00:00:15,392 --> 00:00:18,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear about the motorcycle run for Crystal Campbell?

11
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:21,093
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't, but that sounds really interesting.

12
00:00:21,713 --> 00:00:23,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, guys, I'm on the volleyball team.

13
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,034
[SPEAKER_02]: We finally won a game.

14
00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:25,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.

15
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:27,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys go to the parade?

16
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:28,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there interviewing.

17
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:29,535
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.

18
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:31,146
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to know a joke?

19
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:31,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

20
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:33,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do fat cows go on vacation?

21
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Where?

22
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:35,412
[SPEAKER_03]: New York.

23
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:38,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys remember that time we went to New York?

24
00:00:39,158 --> 00:00:39,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.

25
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:41,321
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.

26
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Live from New York, it's the Mustang Report!

27
00:00:45,566 --> 00:00:49,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Victoria Rasher here with Brie Forcier at the 385th Medford Parade.

28
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:50,970
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you today, Brie?

29
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, how are you?

30
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm great, thanks.

31
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:57,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know that this is the first parade in eight years in Medford?

32
00:00:58,354 --> 00:00:58,835
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

33
00:00:59,395 --> 00:01:00,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you excited to be walking in this parade?

34
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:02,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very excited.

35
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:05,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you walking with during this parade?

36
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:07,460
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm walking with all the lacrosse girls in Galoosie.

37
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:11,123
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the thing that you're most excited to see?

38
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:13,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually very excited to see everybody dressed up.

39
00:01:13,604 --> 00:01:14,145
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty cool.

40
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:15,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Marie.

41
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:16,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun at the parade.

42
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:17,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, you too.

43
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:24,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Victoria Rasche here at the 385th Medford Parade with Mr. Galussi and these two lovely ladies.

44
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:25,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are these two lovely ladies?

45
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:28,527
[SPEAKER_10]: These are my daughters, Olivia and Sophia.

46
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

47
00:01:29,787 --> 00:01:31,768
[SPEAKER_10]: We're here today, you know, to come out for the parade.

48
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:33,488
[SPEAKER_10]: We always love a good parade.

49
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:37,609
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got the lacrosse team, a bunch of other sports teams, swim team, crew team.

50
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:39,329
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're all here to support the mayor.

51
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:41,669
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been very good to all of us, kind of his last hurrah.

52
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,710
[SPEAKER_10]: And say hi to Medford.

53
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,490
[SPEAKER_10]: It should be a great day.

54
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:45,621
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great, guys.

55
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:46,962
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you guys looking forward to the most?

56
00:01:49,084 --> 00:01:50,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Being in a parade.

57
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:53,167
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm excited to be in the parade.

58
00:01:53,568 --> 00:01:53,988
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

59
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:54,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, guys.

60
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:55,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys have a lot of fun.

61
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:56,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much.

62
00:01:58,672 --> 00:02:01,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I'm Katrina Rasche, and I'm here with the Medford hockey team.

63
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:03,395
Hey!

64
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:05,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you guys excited for the parade?

65
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:06,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah!

66
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:11,382
[SPEAKER_15]: OK, so when does your hockey season start?

67
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:13,202
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

68
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:14,463
[SPEAKER_16]: It already started.

69
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:17,326
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys win any games yet?

70
00:02:18,507 --> 00:02:19,368
[SPEAKER_03]: You won two games.

71
00:02:19,408 --> 00:02:20,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Who got the goals?

72
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:27,155
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you guys looking forward to most for the parade today?

73
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:30,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Not walking?

74
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,059
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

75
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:34,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys gonna skate the parade?

76
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:35,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

77
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:36,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Wear your ice skates.

78
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:42,327
[SPEAKER_02]: These are our skates!

79
00:02:42,707 --> 00:02:43,347
[SPEAKER_03]: They're your skates?

80
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:43,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

81
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:46,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Well good luck today guys, walking the parade.

82
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:48,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Wave to us if we're on the sideline, alright?

83
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:51,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Now say bye to Medford.

84
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:56,131
Bye world!

85
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:01,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Victoria Rasher here at the 385th Medford Parade with Mickey and Minnie.

86
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:01,993
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you guys today?

87
00:03:02,273 --> 00:03:02,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty good.

88
00:03:03,398 --> 00:03:03,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

89
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,319
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you looking forward to most for this 385th parade?

90
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing all the little kids, seeing their excitement.

91
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you had a lot of little kids come up to you?

92
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,142
[SPEAKER_12]: A ton, actually.

93
00:03:14,222 --> 00:03:15,262
[SPEAKER_12]: I held a baby today.

94
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,003
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exciting.

95
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:19,584
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does it take to prep to be Mickey and Minnie?

96
00:03:20,684 --> 00:03:21,964
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of practice walking.

97
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,645
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to really see, look at your steps.

98
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:26,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Are the heads heavy?

99
00:03:27,686 --> 00:03:31,388
[SPEAKER_12]: No, they're actually really light, but they're really big, so walking around is kind of tough.

100
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:33,816
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exciting.

101
00:03:34,577 --> 00:03:35,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, have fun today, guys.

102
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:37,679
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you attract a lot of little kids.

103
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

104
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,260
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

105
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:47,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Victoria Rasche here at the 385th Medford Parade, and I'm here with Sean Freeman, the boys' crew captain, and Nev Jacks, the girls' crew captain.

106
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:48,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So how are you guys doing today?

107
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,427
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing well.

108
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:49,828
[SPEAKER_07]: How about you?

109
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:50,648
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm great, thanks.

110
00:03:50,668 --> 00:03:51,049
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you?

111
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:51,849
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm awesome.

112
00:03:51,929 --> 00:03:52,349
[SPEAKER_16]: How are you?

113
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:53,230
[SPEAKER_16]: Good, thanks.

114
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,512
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you guys looking forward to most for the parade?

115
00:03:57,093 --> 00:04:01,556
[SPEAKER_16]: I think representing the crew team and what we've done and showing our Medford spirit.

116
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:02,477
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.

117
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:02,837
[SPEAKER_16]: How about you?

118
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:10,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, pretty much the same thing, just showing how much we've grown and how well we've done in the past seasons and what a future we're looking forward to.

119
00:04:10,522 --> 00:04:15,266
[SPEAKER_03]: So does this kind of half a mile walk, does it count as a practice for you guys today?

120
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:21,430
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we usually don't practice on Sundays, but it's nothing near what a practice would be for us.

121
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Our practice is like super hard.

122
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:27,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Practices, they're definitely intense and they're like working our team and

123
00:04:29,042 --> 00:04:29,322
Yeah.

124
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:35,104
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had, Sean, one word to describe your amazing crew team, what would it be?

125
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:36,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Committed.

126
00:04:37,104 --> 00:04:38,985
[SPEAKER_16]: What about you, Neve?

127
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:40,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Commitment, yeah.

128
00:04:40,705 --> 00:04:41,586
[SPEAKER_16]: And team spirit.

129
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:42,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, commitment.

130
00:04:44,126 --> 00:04:44,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice one.

131
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:45,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, guys.

132
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:46,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Have fun today.

133
00:04:47,894 --> 00:04:49,295
[SPEAKER_03]: So when did your swim season start?

134
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:56,498
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have an informational meeting on Wednesday, October 14th, but the season doesn't start until the Monday after Thanksgiving.

135
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:59,519
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know there have been rumors about your 4 a.m.

136
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:00,120
[SPEAKER_03]: practices.

137
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,320
[SPEAKER_03]: When do you guys practice?

138
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:03,281
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's just a rumor.

139
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:06,023
[SPEAKER_11]: We do practice like every other team after school now.

140
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:08,844
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't do morning practices.

141
00:05:10,577 --> 00:05:12,599
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have an amazing new facility.

142
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:15,341
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of the best high school facilities in the state.

143
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:17,863
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a really great opportunity to be swimming for Medford High.

144
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:20,425
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you have to be a really good swimmer to try out for the swim team?

145
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:24,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, you just need to have the motivation to become a good swimmer.

146
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:25,950
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

147
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,930
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

148
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:27,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, guys.

149
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:29,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully, everyone else tries out for the swim team.

150
00:05:29,873 --> 00:05:30,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't, because I'll drown.

151
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:31,634
[SPEAKER_03]: But thanks.

152
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:35,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Cariann Lucharis and I'm with the Mustang Report.

153
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:39,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here checking out the weather all around the school.

154
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:42,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We're supposed to get a flash flood warning, three to six inches of rain.

155
00:05:42,929 --> 00:05:45,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now it's humid outside and be safe.

156
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:53,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I'm Katrina Rasche and I'm here with the Mustang Report and we're here with Mr. Heineck from the English Department and he's training to run a marathon.

157
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:55,376
[SPEAKER_15]: So Mr. Heineck, how do you train to run a marathon?

158
00:05:55,971 --> 00:06:06,744
[SPEAKER_00]: So what a lot of people do is you download an 18-week training schedule and the first 15 weeks basically increase the amount you run.

159
00:06:07,244 --> 00:06:11,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly on the weekends it's basically designed for people who have jobs.

160
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:15,134
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the week you're running four or five days and then on the weekend you gradually do

161
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:20,116
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more, a little bit more, starting around six or seven, and then it gets all the way up to 20.

162
00:06:20,856 --> 00:06:27,541
[SPEAKER_00]: And to get technical, what it does is you do, say, seven, then eight, and then you go, the third week is like five.

163
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:30,023
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes 10, 11, and then it goes to eight.

164
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:34,105
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of you move forward, and then you move back, and your body acclimates to doing more work.

165
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:37,628
[SPEAKER_15]: So are you taking 18 weeks to train?

166
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:41,098
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing the whole thing exactly as prescribed.

167
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my homework.

168
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:52,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And this way, if I follow it, I'm putting my trust in the experience of a guy named Hal Higdon, who wrote a book called The Marathon.

169
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,781
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy's in his 70s.

170
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,822
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he turned 70, he ran seven marathons in seven months.

171
00:06:58,702 --> 00:06:59,222
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's run over 100.

172
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:03,243
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's sort of like the official marathon guide.

173
00:07:03,343 --> 00:07:04,643
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just sort of following along.

174
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:07,764
[SPEAKER_15]: So would you want to run over 100 marathons?

175
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:09,826
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

176
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,448
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.

177
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:14,670
[SPEAKER_00]: All I really want to do is do better than I did last time.

178
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,352
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran one when I was turning 40, like a bucket list thing.

179
00:07:17,772 --> 00:07:20,795
[SPEAKER_00]: And it went well for about 18 miles, and then it was terrible.

180
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:28,141
[SPEAKER_00]: So this time I decided to sort of train more thoroughly, be better prepared, and eat.

181
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:31,564
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the first time I didn't eat while I was doing it, and so I ran out of energy.

182
00:07:31,924 --> 00:07:33,446
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I know you've got to eat while you're running.

183
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,442
Hey!

184
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:37,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Carrie Anne and I'm back with the Mustang Report.

185
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:38,463
[SPEAKER_04]: We're outside 3rd Cap.

186
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:41,244
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with Lydia Ryan who's an expert on flash flooding.

187
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Lydia, what do you think about all this flooding?

188
00:08:44,366 --> 00:08:52,050
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, there is a collapsed drain pipe on the roof and it's caved in about 30 feet down from the roof and they can't find it yet.

189
00:08:52,430 --> 00:09:02,855
[SPEAKER_14]: However, it's causing leaking to come down from the ceiling and cause major flooding problems and we had a bunch of puddles here but they seem to have cleaned up and now they put giant trash bins here

190
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:05,176
[SPEAKER_14]: to collect the rain from coming down from the roof.

191
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:08,319
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you have any advice for the students that are going to be walking by here?

192
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:10,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't walk under the rain.

193
00:09:11,261 --> 00:09:11,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

194
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:12,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to you.

195
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:15,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here with Dr. Perrella, the initiator of the What Would Tucci Do?

196
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,585
[SPEAKER_03]: So, can you tell me the information about What Would Tucci Do?

197
00:09:19,506 --> 00:09:20,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, absolutely.

198
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I don't think I could take full credit for What Would Tucci Do?

199
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:23,909
[SPEAKER_09]: initiative.

200
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:28,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Although, WTTD project, as we like to call it,

201
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:37,483
[SPEAKER_09]: My wife and I, who was also a big fan of Mr. Tucci, were talking about how the man is amazing and seems to cure and fix every problem that there is.

202
00:09:38,163 --> 00:09:41,505
[SPEAKER_09]: So we sort of came up with that slogan, what would Tucci do?

203
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:48,607
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it somehow materialized onto a t-shirt and I was fortunate enough to find them in a box and I just passed them out to random seniors.

204
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,128
[SPEAKER_09]: That's sort of how it played out.

205
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:51,768
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.

206
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:55,950
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you got a stain on your tie, what would Tucci do for you?

207
00:09:56,552 --> 00:10:05,800
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the first thing he'd probably do is he'd be the first person to identify the stain in the tie and tell me where it came from and how it probably can be fixed and resolved again.

208
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,864
[SPEAKER_09]: He most likely would approach the tie carefully, maybe removing it from my neck without me even knowing it.

209
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:20,772
[SPEAKER_09]: And at that point, somehow, between his language and the way he looks at the tie, the stain would sort of evaporate from the fabric.

210
00:10:21,072 --> 00:10:24,815
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I would expect it to happen, though I haven't seen it yet happen like that.

211
00:10:25,422 --> 00:10:26,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Perlow.

212
00:10:26,382 --> 00:10:27,022
[SPEAKER_09]: You're very welcome.

213
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:36,305
[SPEAKER_03]: If there was a brand new building and there was an older lady on the top floor, what would Tucci do?

214
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:39,286
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Mr. Tucci would go in and save the old lady's life.

215
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:40,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer.

216
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:45,248
[SPEAKER_05]: What would Tucci do?

217
00:10:45,788 --> 00:10:46,388
[SPEAKER_12]: He would strike him off.

218
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,894
[SPEAKER_05]: If there was a wing on the pool, what would Tootie do?

219
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, he would definitely just cover the blowhole.

220
00:10:50,694 --> 00:10:52,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so would it damage the ceiling?

221
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:54,395
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's an angel in distress, what would Tootie do?

222
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:58,137
[SPEAKER_05]: Pick him up and spin him around.

223
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:00,237
[SPEAKER_05]: If David Ortiz became a vampire, what would Tootie do?

224
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:01,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Teach him how to play baseball!

225
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:07,180
[SPEAKER_04]: If Tootie was in a dance battle, what would he do?

226
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,900
[SPEAKER_04]: He would tap dance.

227
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:11,586
[SPEAKER_05]: If Kanye West won for president in 2020, what would Tucci do?

228
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:12,647
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd run against him!

229
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:13,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Go Huggies!

230
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:14,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo!

231
00:11:14,188 --> 00:11:15,568
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's your birthday, what would Tucci do?

232
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Call you down to his office and tell you to run out and break the pencils.

233
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,391
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone tried to assassinate the president and vice president, what would Tucci do?

234
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:22,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Give him detention!

235
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:27,014
What would Tucci do?

236
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:28,675
[SPEAKER_07]: What would he do?

237
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:29,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Kyle!

238
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:30,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you okay?

239
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:34,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you Mr. Tucci.

240
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,001
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a llama in the hallway, what would Tucci do?

241
00:11:40,182 --> 00:11:42,423
[SPEAKER_15]: He would get on it and ride it like Paul Revere!

242
00:11:42,623 --> 00:11:43,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Woo!

243
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:47,127
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's a llama in the hallway, what would Tucci do?

244
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:48,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you have a hall pass for that llama?

245
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:51,430
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody ran in late, but Mr. Tucci knew, what would Mr. Tucci do?

246
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Deliver the baby in a snowstorm.

247
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:54,633
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

248
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:59,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, I'm here with Mr. Tucci, and we have to ask him about the what would Tucci do.

249
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:02,099
[SPEAKER_15]: So, have you seen those shirts around the school?

250
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:13,583
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen them, I walked in this morning and I was totally taken aback and surprised and it's a good thing that got me thinking today on this Friday and it's fun to see people wearing the shirts.

251
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:18,786
[SPEAKER_15]: So how do you feel about this what would Tucci do movement that's sweeping the school?

252
00:12:19,726 --> 00:12:23,127
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a movement but it's caused me to ponder the question too as well.

253
00:12:23,728 --> 00:12:24,488
[SPEAKER_01]: What would Tucci do?

254
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:28,677
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very deep answer that I've been consulting a lot with Dr. Prowler about.

255
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:33,000
[SPEAKER_01]: And him and I have been spending all day talking a little bit about what would Tucci do.

256
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:35,422
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's kind of been my therapist today.

257
00:12:35,983 --> 00:12:40,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so I think we have to answer the question that all our viewers at home are wondering.

258
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:42,007
[SPEAKER_15]: What would Tucci do?

259
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:44,052
[SPEAKER_01]: What would Tucci do?

260
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:56,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a very deep question, like I said, but keep in mind that I am a person that loves Medford High School, in particular, the senior class.

261
00:12:56,895 --> 00:12:57,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would I do?

262
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:00,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna see the senior class go on and graduate.

263
00:13:00,516 --> 00:13:02,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure that does happen.

264
00:13:03,096 --> 00:13:04,016
[SPEAKER_01]: So how's that for an answer?

265
00:13:04,376 --> 00:13:05,617
[SPEAKER_15]: That is an amazing answer.

266
00:13:05,917 --> 00:13:06,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

267
00:13:07,197 --> 00:13:07,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Back to you.
