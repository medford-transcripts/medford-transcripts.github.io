19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,701
[SPEAKER_05]: indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:45,342 --> 00:01:03,688
[SPEAKER_05]: Motions, orders, and resolutions, 17-533, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the city administration establish an action plan to address the Canadian geese problem in our public parks and report back to the council the proposed course of action.

21
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:05,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

22
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:09,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I think this is a rather self-explanatory resolution.

23
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:16,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Ultimately, I went to the park over the weekend with my kids, and my kid picked up some Canadian goose poop, which grossed me out to no end.

24
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:20,512
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've been talking with some individuals in the community.

25
00:01:20,552 --> 00:01:22,033
[SPEAKER_15]: I talked with the director of the parks department.

26
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:29,476
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a problem that's prevalent in a number of our parks in the community, and I'm hoping that the administration can provide us with an action plan as to how to address it.

27
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:32,617
[SPEAKER_15]: We only have a very small window where we can utilize our public parks.

28
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:35,678
[SPEAKER_15]: It's finally stopped raining, and we finally had some nice weather out there.

29
00:01:36,258 --> 00:01:37,239
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's my intent that we have

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,861
[SPEAKER_15]: opportunity to quietly enjoy our public parks free from goose droppings.

31
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:43,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

32
00:01:44,422 --> 00:01:51,264
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo, all those in favor?

33
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:55,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

34
00:01:55,145 --> 00:02:06,908
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-534, offered by Councilor Lango-Kern, be it resolved that the Medford City Council get an update on who has been appointed to the Cable Advisory Committee.

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

36
00:02:09,322 --> 00:02:11,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

37
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:18,811
[SPEAKER_08]: I did receive a couple people who were interested in the new TV3 station and had questions with regards to the Cable Advisory Committee.

38
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:22,554
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the first I was aware that a committee has been established.

39
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:31,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm obviously out of the loop, so I was just wondering if we could get a copy of how many people are on the advisory committee and who they are.

40
00:02:31,814 --> 00:02:42,858
[SPEAKER_08]: as well as have they met yet and if there are any minutes, I'd like to just amend this, if there's been any minutes, if we could get a copy of those minutes so we can better see what's been transpiring.

41
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:53,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's great we have the station up and running to a point and just want to keep an idea of what's happening so we're able to answer people's questions as well.

42
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:54,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

43
00:02:55,622 --> 00:03:02,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lococo, if I could amend that to ask if we're doing interviews for a manager for the station also?

44
00:03:03,364 --> 00:03:03,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes please.

45
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:04,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

46
00:03:05,705 --> 00:03:13,527
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Lococo, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo, as amended by President Caraviello, all those in favor?

47
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:14,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

48
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:18,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

49
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:22,810
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-535 offered by Councilor Lococo, be it resolved that the Medford City Council

50
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:38,599
[SPEAKER_05]: to be provided a breakdown from the school department of the number of school transfers from one Medford public school to another, request in 2015, 16, 17, and the number of transfers allowed by each school.

51
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:43,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that the numbers be broken down by school.

52
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:44,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

53
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:44,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

54
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:50,126
[SPEAKER_08]: President Caraviello, I believe within the next couple nights we're meeting with the superintendent of schools to go over.

55
00:03:50,486 --> 00:03:55,511
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have it yet, but hopefully we'll get it sooner than later, the budget for the school department.

56
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:02,797
[SPEAKER_08]: I was recently asked how many transfers there are from one school to another by a resident, and I have had no idea.

57
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:04,439
[SPEAKER_08]: So I said I will put this on.

58
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:11,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be curious to see how many transfer requests are out there and how many are allowed per each school.

59
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there's a discrepancy with the amount of children that are in each school.

60
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:25,910
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to see, and there was an issue with class size for one of the grades at the Roberts that was discussed last night at the school committee meeting.

61
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,454
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to see how it is all broken down over the last three years so we can get a better idea.

62
00:04:31,494 --> 00:04:34,516
[SPEAKER_08]: When we look at the numbers, we can kind of have the big picture.

63
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:37,438
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also want to be able to answer people's questions.

64
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:42,998
[SPEAKER_08]: I know a lot of people do request, I don't know if it's a lot, but people do request transfers.

65
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:46,762
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just something that we've never asked and we've never got an answer to.

66
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:57,211
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's be relevant to get these answers before we meet with the superintendent or at least before we vote on the budget potentially next Tuesday.

67
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,513
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I could move approval with a roll call vote.

68
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:00,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

69
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo.

70
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, Mr. President.

71
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:11,577
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Legon-Kern and seconded by Councilor Dello Russo, a roll call vote has been requested.

72
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

73
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:16,558

74

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

87
00:05:29,048 --> 00:05:32,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

88
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:34,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

89
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:37,656
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-536, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

90
00:05:38,636 --> 00:05:47,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council be provided a list from the school department of all increased and decreased class sizes within our Medford public schools.

91
00:05:48,045 --> 00:05:54,210
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, if a class is adding a class due to class size issues or vice versa.

92
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

93
00:05:55,831 --> 00:05:56,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

94
00:05:57,031 --> 00:06:21,732
[SPEAKER_08]: President Caraviello, I put this on last week, I believe it was Wednesday, Thursday, I started getting phone calls with regards to the concern of class sizes, mainly at one school and one grade, and I put this on because there's talk of, every year I'm assuming, depending on the numbers, there may be one or two or three, I don't know how many,

95
00:06:22,668 --> 00:06:34,870
[SPEAKER_08]: where a teacher is pulled from a grade to accommodate another grade and I wanted to see how many of those we have this coming year so we can obviously get control of it and make sure all our class sizes allow.

96
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:48,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe after last night's meeting we were guaranteed that all class sizes would be under 22 and I believe the class average is about 20 students per classroom so I just want to make sure we

97
00:06:49,724 --> 00:06:56,969
[SPEAKER_08]: maintain that level and we make sure that we're gonna provide those little class sizes to everybody, every student across the board.

98
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:58,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

99
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,734
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

100
00:07:03,554 --> 00:07:04,355
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

101
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:06,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

102
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:10,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

103
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:16,924
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-537, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the Medford City Council be provided

104
00:07:17,873 --> 00:07:26,416
[SPEAKER_05]: with a list from the school department of all new hires and newly created positions within the fiscal year 2018 budget.

105
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:32,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that we also receive a list of all positions that have been eliminated.

106
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:34,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

107
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:36,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you again, President Caraviello.

108
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:45,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Each year we are left with the large school budget and to look and see, try to figure out who's been added, who's been taken out of the budget.

109
00:07:47,025 --> 00:08:05,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Each year we have sometimes a position or two or three that has been created, which obviously is something that I think needs to be in bold print, if not obviously given to us separately so we can understand what is going on in the school system and be able to vote on the budget accordingly.

110
00:08:05,654 --> 00:08:15,559
[SPEAKER_08]: So I asked for a list of all those new hires and newly created positions as well as all the positions that are being eliminated so we can do our job.

111
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:17,533
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Lococoon.

112
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:21,475

[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

115
00:08:24,756 --> 00:08:24,856
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

116

[SPEAKER_05]: A motion passes.

134
00:08:56,985 --> 00:08:59,606
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-538 offered by Vice President Mox.

135
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:08,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the lack of attention from utility companies regarding double poles in our community be discussed.

136
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox.

137
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

138
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:25,919
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I'd like to, I received a letter from Superintendent of WIRES, Steven Randazzo, and this is a recent happening, Mr. President.

139
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,882
[SPEAKER_04]: The letter is dated June 5th, 2017, and it's from Verizon.

140
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:42,129
[SPEAKER_04]: As we all know, National Grid, for many years in this community, was the custodian of all the telephone poles, or I should say, a good majority of the telephone poles in the city.

141
00:09:42,757 --> 00:09:52,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And just recently, Verizon and National Grid reached an agreement on who the custodian of the poles are, and I think this is pertinent information for this council.

142
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:59,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to read just a portion, Mr. President, as I stated dated June 5th, 2017 from Verizon.

143
00:10:00,447 --> 00:10:12,473
[SPEAKER_04]: This is dear municipal official, this is to inform you that effective May 31st, 2017, National Grid and Verizon have reached an agreement that changes the way the two companies perform

144
00:10:12,923 --> 00:10:15,184
[SPEAKER_04]: utility pole work in your community.

145
00:10:15,765 --> 00:10:19,147
[SPEAKER_04]: The agreement updates operating procedures in place for more than 30 years.

146
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:33,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Under the new agreement, custodial areas where one or more other pole owner had assumed responsibility for replacing and installing new utility poles on a municipal basis have been eliminated.

147
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:41,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, National Grid will be responsible for all replacements, relocations, and new installations of jointly owned poles.

148
00:10:41,996 --> 00:10:51,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Verizon will be responsible for removing all jointly owned poles once the replacement pole is installed and all facility transfers are completed.

149
00:10:51,980 --> 00:11:06,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now, Mr. President, according to this letter, Verizon will now be responsible for the removal of all double poles, which is brand new to this community and I think one that people should be aware of.

150
00:11:08,847 --> 00:11:19,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I offer this resolution tonight, Mr. President, to address the lack of attention with utility companies to the number of double poles we have in the community.

151
00:11:19,816 --> 00:11:28,303
[SPEAKER_04]: According to our Superintendent Owais, we have a little over 8,400 telephone poles within the community.

152
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:38,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And according to the latest list I just received, there are roughly 245 double poles in the community.

153
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:47,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you look at it as a street situation, almost one out of every three streets in our community has a double pole on it.

154
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:59,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, the current list is Verizon has 88 poles that they're responsible for removing wires, and that's why the pole is still up, the double pole.

155
00:11:59,913 --> 00:12:07,035
[SPEAKER_04]: National Grid has 51 poles they're responsible for, and Comcast has 101 poles.

156
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:11,916
[SPEAKER_04]: The city of Medford, Mr. President, and I'm proud to report this,

157
00:12:12,757 --> 00:12:25,567
[SPEAKER_04]: back several years ago, was on close to, I believe it was 90 to 100 poles, that we had fire call boxes that were still hooked up, and they were holding the utility companies from removing the double pole.

158
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:31,331
[SPEAKER_04]: To date, Mr. President, we have one double pole on the city of Medford.

159
00:12:32,512 --> 00:12:41,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is a huge accomplishment, and the Superintendent of Wires, Steven Randazzo, should be commended on his work

160
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:51,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, for putting together a priority list and getting our city utility, which is the fire call box, off the poles, Mr. President.

161
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,963
[SPEAKER_04]: But double poles, as we know, are a blight to our community and a public safety concern to area residents.

162
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:04,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Utility companies are unresponsive and have no incentive to remove double poles in a reasonable time frame.

163
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:10,889
[SPEAKER_04]: The current system for moving polls is dysfunctional and the state law ineffective.

164
00:13:11,609 --> 00:13:22,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Municipalities need a new approach that hold utility companies accountable, requiring better coordination and improved communication to resolve this problem.

165
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:31,785
[SPEAKER_04]: As we all know, Chapter 164, Section 34B forbids companies from keeping double poles up for more than 90 days.

166
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:37,169
[SPEAKER_04]: However, there is no penalty to the utility company for not complying with the law.

167
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:44,474
[SPEAKER_04]: On July 28, 2005, the Mass Supreme Court Judicial Court upheld a lower court ruling

168
00:13:45,088 --> 00:13:52,553
[SPEAKER_04]: overturning a Bedford Mass bylaw, imposing a $100 a day fine for each set of double utility poles.

169
00:13:53,153 --> 00:13:59,197
[SPEAKER_04]: The court ruled that only the state legislature has the authority to impose a fine for keeping double poles.

170
00:14:00,218 --> 00:14:07,983
[SPEAKER_04]: So based on that decision back in 2005, Mr. President, I offered a council resolution on October 3rd

171
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:32,061
[SPEAKER_04]: 2006, requesting our state delegation amend chapter 164, section 34B, allowing city or town to the ability to enact local ordinances or bylaws prohibiting double polls beyond the 90 days, punishable by a fine not to exceed a maximum of $100 per occurrence per day.

172
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:34,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Rep.

173
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:35,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Scortino

174
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:57,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Then on October 6, 2006, based on the council resolution, offered a sponsor to build, Mr. President, with that exact terminology, which would allow, it was House Bill 1675, which would allow local cities and towns to actually find these utility companies.

175
00:14:58,258 --> 00:15:02,959
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got bantered around in the State House, and

176
00:15:04,622 --> 00:15:14,968
[SPEAKER_04]: What ultimately ended up happening, from what I understand, is that the utility companies were upset.

177
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:17,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see where, let's see.

178
00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:26,295
[SPEAKER_04]: The utility companies, Mr. President, were upset because they said it was unfair.

179
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:29,304
[SPEAKER_04]: to find the custodian of the pole.

180
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:39,390
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, at the time, if National Grid owned the pole, they also had Comcast, Verizon on the pole, and they may be the ones holding up the process.

181
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,793
[SPEAKER_04]: So they said, how can you find us as the custodian where these other utilities are holding up the process?

182
00:15:46,638 --> 00:16:00,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my opinion, Mr. President, the responsibility of the utility company that's the pole owner, they have license agreements with all these other attachees that are on the pole.

183
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:06,474
[SPEAKER_04]: And their license agreement states that they have the authority to transfer wires

184
00:16:06,998 --> 00:16:08,399
[SPEAKER_04]: at the attachee's expense.

185
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:20,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So if National Grid thought Comcast was taking too long removing their wires, under their license agreement, they can go in at the attachee's expense and remove the wires, and we can get rid of the double pole.

186
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:29,352
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see how the ambiguity that's out there really lends itself to a process that is not functioning, Mr. President.

187
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:34,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And this has been an issue, as you can see, it dates back to 2006 and far beyond that.

188
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:56,500
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I want to offer tonight, Mr. President, with the hopes of getting approval from this council, is that the state create, and this would be the Department of Telecommunications, they create, Mr. President, a statewide database

189
00:16:57,471 --> 00:17:00,793
[SPEAKER_04]: which they oversee and they enforce.

190
00:17:01,293 --> 00:17:24,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, there's a database called Poll Lifetime Management System, and all the utility companies, it's PLM, all the utility companies and many municipalities have access to this system, so they can go online and look at these reports, which I have a copy in front of me, that states who's on the poll, how long the poll's been there, and who's responsible for taking their wires off.

191
00:17:25,947 --> 00:17:30,409
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have access to this system, but there's no oversight by the state.

192
00:17:30,969 --> 00:17:47,094
[SPEAKER_04]: So my request tonight through a motion of this council is that we request our state delegation to file legislation creating the statewide enforcement and penalty structure under the oversight and responsibility of the Mass.

193
00:17:47,114 --> 00:17:48,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Public Utilities.

194
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:55,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And by doing so, Mr. President, we'll create a state entity that's responsible for the oversight

195
00:17:55,814 --> 00:18:06,357
[SPEAKER_04]: and also serve as an online tracking process that allows review of the state and possible finding by the state.

196
00:18:06,717 --> 00:18:08,638
[SPEAKER_04]: So the municipalities don't have to get involved.

197
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:10,798
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the utility, Mass.

198
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:16,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Public Utilities, which currently right now is the oversight for utilities in Massachusetts.

199
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,201
[SPEAKER_04]: They should step up to the plate and take responsibility.

200
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:28,721
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be my recommendation tonight, Mr. President, that our state delegation file legislation to allow enforcement by Mass.

201
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:33,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Public Utilities and also the ability to find, Mr. President, by Mass.

202
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:48,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Public Utilities so we can once and for all put this issue in the rearview mirror and not have to reinvent this issue every year after year when the utility companies are just ignoring our request

203
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:51,216
[SPEAKER_04]: to remove double poles, Mr. President.

204
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:52,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

205
00:18:53,997 --> 00:18:54,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo?

206
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:56,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

207
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:58,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

208
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:00,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you... Nothing to add?

209
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,722
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

210
00:19:07,623 --> 00:19:08,463
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

211
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:09,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

212
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:11,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

213
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:14,246
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo?

214
00:19:14,626 --> 00:19:14,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

215
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:18,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

216
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:19,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

217
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

218
00:19:22,548 --> 00:19:25,450
[SPEAKER_06]: 17-539 petition by Lisa DeFabritis,

219
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:53,705
[SPEAKER_05]: 32 Winford Way, Medford, to address the council about property owners maintaining minimal standards of care.

220
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:54,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

221
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:54,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

222
00:19:54,886 --> 00:19:55,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

223
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:59,009
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, name Lisa DeFabritas, Winford Way.

224
00:19:59,509 --> 00:19:59,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

225
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,270
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

226
00:20:02,111 --> 00:20:13,438
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to kindly request the council to consider the implementation of an ordinance to require property owners to maintain their property at a minimum standard of care and cleanliness.

227
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Some cities have such an ordinance in place, but Medford does not.

228
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:28,331
[SPEAKER_14]: The majority of residents do maintain their property in good condition, but the few who do not cause a significant impact to their neighbors and to those who pass by these properties.

229
00:20:28,631 --> 00:20:38,778
[SPEAKER_14]: For example, one, this potential fire hazard for uncut grass that grows to excessive heights that can become a fire hazard in the summertime.

230
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:42,358
[SPEAKER_14]: Two, the attraction of unwanted animals and pests.

231
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:51,123
[SPEAKER_14]: For example, rotted wood on structures of a property or lying on their property that can attract termites and easily spread to neighboring homes.

232
00:20:51,844 --> 00:20:55,927
[SPEAKER_14]: The attraction of rats, mice that can cause infestation.

233
00:20:56,907 --> 00:21:07,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Three, the deterrence of prospective buyers who want to purchase or invest in a property that is in close proximity to a neglected property.

234
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:14,972
[SPEAKER_14]: The depreciation value of a property that is in the vicinity of a neglected or deplorable property.

235
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:27,375
[SPEAKER_14]: One could argue from a legal standpoint that a negligent property owner could be liable for damages because their negligence causes the loss of value to another property owner.

236
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:34,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Lastly, it's simply unsightly, inoffensive to see a neglected property in our neighborhood.

237
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:43,478
[SPEAKER_14]: And allowing property to be kept in deplorable conditions goes against the efforts of the city to maintain a sense of pride and decency in our community.

238
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,966
[SPEAKER_14]: The city has ordinances in place for dog owners, dog waste, property owners to keep their sidewalks clear of debris and snow, public littering, et cetera.

239
00:21:55,011 --> 00:22:11,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Not having an ordinance in place to address negligent property owners hurts the majority of residents by allowing so-called slum property owners to embarrass our city, cause a depreciation of surrounding property value, and increase safety risks.

240
00:22:11,923 --> 00:22:27,702
[SPEAKER_14]: Additionally, without an ordinance in place, the City and its residents are helpless to address this issue, leaving individual residents to try and resolve matters on their own, which could result in bad situations amongst neighbors that could lead to civil unrest and violence.

241
00:22:29,477 --> 00:22:42,107
[SPEAKER_14]: We shouldn't have to wait until a bad situation occurs before recognizing the need for a common sense ordinance to ensure Medford can be proud of its city and its surroundings.

242
00:22:43,608 --> 00:22:56,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to share a copy of an ordinance from another city regarding the cleanliness expectations from its residents and property owners that I'm happy to leave as a reference for consideration.

243
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:58,199
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you for your time.

244
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

245
00:23:08,162 --> 00:23:09,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Dello Russo.

246
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:11,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

247
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:14,587
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could, through the chair, ask the citizen, Ms.

248
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:26,997
[SPEAKER_03]: DeFabritis, is there a particular incident that is inspiring you to ask for this ordinance?

249
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:31,101
[SPEAKER_03]: And secondly, my second question would be,

250
00:23:33,394 --> 00:23:45,001
[SPEAKER_03]: to ask if she's aware or finds a failing in public health regulations and building code regulations that are often invoked to remedy these situations.

251
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:46,021
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

252
00:23:46,061 --> 00:23:46,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I have.

253
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:53,705
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, for years, I lived next to a property like that.

254
00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:58,528
[SPEAKER_14]: And for years, I lived next to a property in that

255
00:23:59,008 --> 00:24:00,989
[SPEAKER_14]: in deplorable conditions.

256
00:24:01,149 --> 00:24:09,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Both myself and many of my residents, the neighbors on my street, have tried for years to reach out to the city to have this addressed.

257
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:16,018
[SPEAKER_14]: I personally, myself, over the past year have spoken to the building department, the health department, the police, the city.

258
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:20,241
[SPEAKER_14]: Every department that everyone has referred me to, I have contacted.

259
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:25,004
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have been told that there is nothing they can do about it unless

260
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:28,685
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a safety issue.

261
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:29,986
[SPEAKER_14]: There was limitations.

262
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:32,407
[SPEAKER_14]: And it brought me to this particular point.

263
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:38,649
[SPEAKER_14]: There is no ordinance in the city that allows the city to address this problem.

264
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:42,750
[SPEAKER_14]: If there was an ordinance, the city and the police can go there and say, hey, this is an ordinance.

265
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,951
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to take care of this.

266
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:45,191
[SPEAKER_14]: This is unacceptable, whatever.

267
00:24:45,211 --> 00:24:50,793
[SPEAKER_14]: The conditions as stated forth in an ordinance sort of allows the authorities of the city to enforce it.

268
00:24:51,378 --> 00:24:55,319
[SPEAKER_14]: and or potentially fine property owners if they don't keep them.

269
00:24:55,639 --> 00:24:57,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I'm only asking a minimal standard.

270
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,581
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm not saying they have to keep it as a palace, but there are certain minimal expectations.

271
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:08,524
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel that everybody should respect for your community and for your neighbors.

272
00:25:09,584 --> 00:25:12,005
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure I answered all your questions.

273
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:12,365
[SPEAKER_03]: You did.

274
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:13,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

275
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:14,106
[SPEAKER_14]: My pleasure.

276
00:25:14,826 --> 00:25:15,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

277
00:25:15,706 --> 00:25:16,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

278
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:18,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Max.

279
00:25:19,707 --> 00:25:20,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

280
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:25,108
[SPEAKER_04]: There is an ordinance regarding the exterior of the property.

281
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a clean it or lean it ordinance.

282
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,552
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been in effect for a number of years.

283
00:25:29,253 --> 00:25:42,766
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I know the building department has used that for several properties throughout the community, uh, and have been, uh, very, uh, responsive to, uh, the owners of the property and cleaning the property itself.

284
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:52,507
[SPEAKER_04]: regarding a property that may have other issues, as Councilor Del Russo mentioned, maybe border health issues or road in issues, which would be border health.

285
00:25:53,728 --> 00:26:06,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they could enforce if they needed to, and maybe it's just a matter of getting the right attention to get down there and have them take a look at the property to see if it's in need.

286
00:26:08,075 --> 00:26:12,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not aware of the property, but like I said, the clean and the lean it,

287
00:26:13,075 --> 00:26:14,876
[SPEAKER_04]: would apply to the exterior.

288
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:21,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So if someone has just say a bathtub on their front lawn, and believe it or not, it's happened before.

289
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:25,983
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a portable toilet in the driveway that's been sitting there for six months.

290
00:26:26,303 --> 00:26:29,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, that would be ideal for the clean it or lean it.

291
00:26:29,605 --> 00:26:30,486
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be ideal.

292
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:42,293
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we could remedy, I don't know if you want to give an address, but we can recommend through this council that the Board of Health as well as code enforcement go out to the property

293
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,510
[SPEAKER_04]: and do a site view.

294
00:26:44,611 --> 00:26:46,971
[SPEAKER_14]: I did go to the building department last week.

295
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:54,113
[SPEAKER_14]: And I explained it, and they told me there was only limited resources.

296
00:26:54,133 --> 00:27:02,736
[SPEAKER_14]: They were limited to what they could do based on the cleaner or leaner that you were referring to.

297
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:08,058
[SPEAKER_14]: They did mention that they were going to go there and try and talk to the owner about it.

298
00:27:10,118 --> 00:27:10,879
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't heard back.

299
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,441
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

300
00:27:14,082 --> 00:27:16,746
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the information's Councilor Scarpelli.

301
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:19,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, yeah.

302
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we, I'm sorry to interrupt.

303
00:27:21,412 --> 00:27:28,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I just, I wasn't know if it was someone just put, but a porta potty, I think that a building department should know through the permitting process.

304
00:27:29,204 --> 00:27:29,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct?

305
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,520
[SPEAKER_02]: The board of health.

306
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,521
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably not a, it's not a legal one.

307
00:27:32,801 --> 00:27:32,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

308
00:27:33,021 --> 00:27:35,321
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, I know, but if it's there too long.

309
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:35,741
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

310
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:36,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

311
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:36,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

312
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:36,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

313
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:45,143
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may, I mean there are, there are many issues in this particular property and, and I, um, I'm for sure there are other properties throughout the city.

314
00:27:45,704 --> 00:27:51,405
[SPEAKER_14]: The bottom line is it's just like, there should be a minimal expect, you know, expectations of property owner.

315
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:52,005
[SPEAKER_14]: For example,

316
00:27:52,305 --> 00:27:57,087
[SPEAKER_14]: what about the, you know, there is no ordinance for currently or anything on the books about grass.

317
00:27:57,527 --> 00:28:03,890
[SPEAKER_14]: When you have a drought, like a situation we had last year where it didn't rain all summer and you have grass that's, you know, like four feet high.

318
00:28:04,671 --> 00:28:05,931
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's a fire hazard.

319
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:08,632
[SPEAKER_14]: There should be some kind of ordinance and expectation there.

320
00:28:09,073 --> 00:28:14,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it applies to all that, just so you know that it applies to grass that's unkept.

321
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:17,916
[SPEAKER_04]: It applies to putting items on your lawn or in your yard.

322
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:19,076
[SPEAKER_14]: I was told by the building.

323
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:19,716
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't mean to interrupt.

324
00:28:19,756 --> 00:28:27,619
[SPEAKER_14]: I was told by the building last week that that was not applicable to the situation.

325
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you've got bogus information.

326
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

327
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,281
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know it's applied in other circumstances.

328
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:36,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to give out where the property was.

329
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:43,223
[SPEAKER_04]: But that clean and lean, and it was regarding tall bushes, regarding tall grass that was unkept.

330
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:49,442
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke to two people, one in person, one on the phone, gave them the property address.

331
00:28:49,462 --> 00:28:51,666
[SPEAKER_14]: They said they were going to go out and speak to them.

332
00:28:52,487 --> 00:28:59,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I was told that they were limited to what they were able to do to enforce it or force

333
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:02,182
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the property owner to do anything about it.

334
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:06,607
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I've been after this for years and more recently last week.

335
00:29:06,687 --> 00:29:08,689
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have yet to see any results.

336
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:12,213
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I haven't heard anybody back from the building department.

337
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:16,118
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, if there's an ordinance, if that is applicable, then, um,

338
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:20,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that a written document?

339
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,792
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a city ordinance.

340
00:29:21,912 --> 00:29:22,612
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a city ordinance.

341
00:29:22,632 --> 00:29:25,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have the site section, but it's a city ordinance.

342
00:29:25,215 --> 00:29:28,538
[SPEAKER_14]: And that pertains to everything that I'm describing?

343
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:29,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

344
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

345
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:30,820
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

346
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:39,589
[SPEAKER_14]: So they can use that to enforce the property owner to make their property

347
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:43,879
[SPEAKER_14]: comply to a certain standard.

348
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:44,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Clean it or lean it.

349
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Clean it, meaning clean it up or lean it.

350
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:56,501
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm very confused because, again, I've been to every department in the city for the past year and a half or two years, and I have... Well, if you're that confused, grab a seat and you can come back here with us.

351
00:29:57,201 --> 00:29:57,862
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to.

352
00:29:59,482 --> 00:30:08,444
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I could get a copy of that ordinance at some point, and if maybe the building department can follow up on this,

353
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:15,117
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I can get some answers to know what the next step is.

354
00:30:15,137 --> 00:30:16,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us an address.

355
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:16,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have an address?

356
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:17,619
[SPEAKER_04]: We need an address.

357
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:21,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.

358
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:23,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you.

359
00:30:23,082 --> 00:30:23,442
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

360
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:26,844
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

361
00:30:26,904 --> 00:30:28,124
[SPEAKER_05]: I look at addresses all the time.

362
00:30:29,205 --> 00:30:30,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lococoon.

363
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to mention the Clean It and Lean It ordinance, too, and I feel like

364
00:30:35,689 --> 00:30:42,014
[SPEAKER_08]: If we get the proper department, you know, the person in the building department, we can try to get somebody out there for a site visit.

365
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:48,058
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think the best way to do that is for her to email us all and we can, you know, obviously help work it out.

366
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:49,359
[SPEAKER_08]: But I agree.

367
00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:51,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a lot of properties.

368
00:30:51,121 --> 00:30:55,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I was contacting the building department last week on a property on Doonan Street.

369
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,986
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been under construction for about two and a half years.

370
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,047
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no stairs.

371
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:00,808
[SPEAKER_08]: There's rocks.

372
00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:05,151
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, grass couldn't even grow because there's rocks everywhere and I'm getting complaints on it.

373
00:31:05,555 --> 00:31:07,016
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is hard for the building departments.

374
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:11,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes their hands are tied.

375
00:31:11,797 --> 00:31:18,599
[SPEAKER_08]: But for something like this, it seems like our Board of Health and our building department should be able to do a site visit.

376
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:23,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there's no permit on that porta potty that's in somebody's driveway, something should be done.

377
00:31:24,361 --> 00:31:24,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

378
00:31:25,462 --> 00:31:26,062
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Nice.

379
00:31:26,923 --> 00:31:37,126
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I have had great luck with the Board of Health and the Code Enforcement Office in getting some of these issues rectified as well, so I really think it might be that we need to point an individual in the right direction.

380
00:31:37,706 --> 00:31:43,748
[SPEAKER_15]: With that being said, though, the lady was kind enough to pass out a copy of an ordinance that I'm hoping we can all get copies of.

381
00:31:44,588 --> 00:31:47,209
[SPEAKER_15]: At this point in time, I'd ask that the paper be received and placed on file.

382
00:31:47,249 --> 00:31:52,010
[SPEAKER_15]: We have an opportunity to take a look at the draft ordinance that's in place, and we can contrast that with our

383
00:31:52,457 --> 00:32:00,303
[SPEAKER_15]: existing rules and regulations that are established by the Board of Health and the Building Commission, and then we can determine whether or not we need to move forward with a minimum standard of cleanliness ordinance, Mr. President.

384
00:32:00,723 --> 00:32:01,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

385
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,265
[SPEAKER_05]: Larry, if you can make us copy.

386
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:09,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

387
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,990
[SPEAKER_10]: Gene Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street.

388
00:32:13,472 --> 00:32:20,037
[SPEAKER_10]: I think on the face, when you look at these properties that are distressed, they're a symptom to a larger issue.

389
00:32:20,617 --> 00:32:21,818
[SPEAKER_10]: And although I appreciate

390
00:32:22,158 --> 00:32:24,478
[SPEAKER_10]: with a clean it or lean it approach.

391
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:28,039
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just residents that we have a problem with.

392
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:29,739
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also businesses.

393
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:39,641
[SPEAKER_10]: So my position is a lot of these instances, when you delve a little deeper, you're dealing with people who are barely hanging on.

394
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:43,182
[SPEAKER_10]: They're the folks working two jobs who don't have time to mow the lawn.

395
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:50,103
[SPEAKER_10]: They're being deaf by paper cuts in fees and expenses from the city.

396
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,024
[SPEAKER_10]: I really think it's a very slippery slope.

397
00:32:54,644 --> 00:33:15,172
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we're going to start to really look at enforcing a clean it or lean it, then it should also be applied, perhaps more heavy-handedly, to the property owners who allow their commercial properties to remain empty and an eyesore on the city for a tax write-off in their real estate portfolio.

398
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:20,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly, those people can afford it far more than some individual who may be

399
00:33:20,477 --> 00:33:23,019
[SPEAKER_10]: as having trouble keeping their property.

400
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:33,965
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would urge you, as you start to look at this ordinance and delve into it deeper, to consider that some of these folks, it's an issue of finance and time.

401
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:43,711
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is another one of those methods and approaches that can often lead to gentrification.

402
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:49,915
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's no secret how I feel about balancing our development

403
00:33:50,508 --> 00:33:54,010
[SPEAKER_10]: in our image with not gentrifying our residents out.

404
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,332
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would just ask you to consider those things as you look at it.

405
00:33:57,352 --> 00:33:57,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

406
00:33:59,253 --> 00:33:59,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Ms.

407
00:33:59,793 --> 00:34:00,213
[SPEAKER_05]: Nugent.

408
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:09,659
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Knight that we review and place on file, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

409
00:34:10,539 --> 00:34:17,383
[SPEAKER_05]: The messenger is doing that as we speak.

410
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:18,764
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

411
00:34:19,823 --> 00:34:22,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

412
00:34:23,946 --> 00:34:27,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Vice President Marks to move suspension of the rules.

413
00:34:32,011 --> 00:34:32,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

414
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

415
00:34:37,415 --> 00:34:42,539
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Robert Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August body.

416
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,322
[SPEAKER_09]: I come here tonight on two very important issues.

417
00:34:48,197 --> 00:34:52,058
[SPEAKER_09]: that directly affect this Medford City Council and the taxpayers of our community.

418
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:57,220
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one is to address the issue of the CPA, the Community Preservation Act.

419
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:04,322
[SPEAKER_09]: As we know, when it was passed in November of 2015, it has a lifespan of five years from the date of its passage.

420
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:08,243
[SPEAKER_09]: It's now going to be just about into its second year with three years to go.

421
00:35:09,064 --> 00:35:15,245
[SPEAKER_09]: The unfortunate part about this CPA is that at an election night some two years ago, almost 1,200 to 1,300 ballots

422
00:35:17,307 --> 00:35:20,869
[SPEAKER_09]: were never acted upon because a lot of people never turned the ballot over to vote for it.

423
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:24,150
[SPEAKER_09]: So whether it was going to pass or not, nobody even knew.

424
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:27,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, it did pass from those members that did vote.

425
00:35:28,172 --> 00:35:38,198
[SPEAKER_09]: The unfortunate part about this particular act, and I'm going to draw the correlation to the connectivity fee, it's another tax being opposed upon the taxpayers of this community.

426
00:35:38,238 --> 00:35:42,079
[SPEAKER_09]: But unfortunately, they're not getting that for which they voted for.

427
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,081
[SPEAKER_09]: The Enabling Act, which goes back to 2001 and 2002,

428
00:35:47,789 --> 00:36:05,759
[SPEAKER_09]: addressed itself through the years, right up until this past year, to the fact that whatever and however the population count takes place, and however the tax valuation on assessed pieces of property here in the city of Medford, as in all cities and towns, determines the dollar amount that will come back from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

429
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:11,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we all know that for the past years, the Commonwealth has been having a tough time.

430
00:36:11,862 --> 00:36:15,004
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's just go back to fiscal year 2013, the state gave back

431
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,881
[SPEAKER_09]: 52 percent.

432
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:21,223
[SPEAKER_09]: Fiscal year 2014, 31 percent.

433
00:36:21,764 --> 00:36:25,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Fiscal year 2015, 29.7 percent.

434
00:36:26,347 --> 00:36:30,871
[SPEAKER_09]: And this present past fiscal year 2016, they were at 18 percent.

435
00:36:31,812 --> 00:36:45,642
[SPEAKER_09]: So for every dollar that every taxpayer here in the city of Medford has given up as it relates to their assessed evaluation at the 1.5 percent, the state will give back approximately 18 percent, which is nowhere near the dollar for dollar of 100 percent.

436
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:56,462
[SPEAKER_09]: I've spoken to members up at the legislature and I've spoken to other cities and towns where they feel to some degree that the taxpayer is not getting their real bang for the buck.

437
00:36:56,842 --> 00:36:59,342
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys and gals are into this thing on the second year.

438
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:01,043
[SPEAKER_09]: You still have no program.

439
00:37:01,363 --> 00:37:12,585
[SPEAKER_09]: There's still no designation where and how that money can be spent, whether it's for housing, affordable housing, parks and recreation, or historical values.

440
00:37:12,625 --> 00:37:13,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the three primary things.

441
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:16,730
[SPEAKER_09]: at a minimum of each one of those.

442
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:22,833
[SPEAKER_09]: So what I did is I looked at the law and I found it on page, it's section 18.

443
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:25,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Larry, he's not here when he comes back.

444
00:37:27,095 --> 00:37:34,258
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think what I would want to do, and I'll pass one off for each of you, the intent of what I'd like to have is to have you as a city council consider the following.

445
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:40,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Since in fact the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not paying back dollar for dollar as people

446
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:46,897
[SPEAKER_09]: have been led to believe because of the 158 cities and towns that now make up the CPA throughout the commonwealth.

447
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:57,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it's fair that we should keep paying, having our taxpayers pay their 1.5 share for the purposes of hopefully thinking they're going to get a match back.

448
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:04,355
[SPEAKER_09]: The proposal that I'm asking you as a council to do is to file a piece of legislation to amend

449
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:31,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Section 18, A and B. And in those two sections, they basically will say, if in fact the Commonwealth cannot meet its obligation of dollar for dollar for which the city of Medford at 1.5 is taxing their residents, then the city can suspend, by a vote of the city council, suspend any further collection of those taxes or that 1.5%, or you could also vote to reduce it down to 1%,

450
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:36,109
[SPEAKER_09]: until further notice, until the Commonwealth meets its obligation.

451
00:38:36,909 --> 00:38:37,790
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the first part.

452
00:38:38,270 --> 00:39:00,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second part, and I think it's very important that it's understood, that if this city and this council wants to not renew the CPA after its fifth year, at present, the only way you can do it is it becomes automatically taking place unless the city council, by a vote, puts the question on the ballot and the people vote for it all over again.

453
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,668
[SPEAKER_09]: My amendment to that portion states basically this.

454
00:39:05,028 --> 00:39:07,649
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the fifth year, it automatically dies.

455
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:18,353
[SPEAKER_09]: If, in fact, the people of this community and whoever the council might be at that time wishes to go forward and renew it again for another five years, then the question goes on the ballot.

456
00:39:19,073 --> 00:39:22,755
[SPEAKER_09]: You are dealing with right now your second fiscal year on this CPA.

457
00:39:23,635 --> 00:39:28,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think any one of you behind this rail have even been informed as to where and how that money is going to be spent.

458
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:30,857
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are provisos in there.

459
00:39:30,977 --> 00:39:32,218
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a 12-page document.

460
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:34,180
[SPEAKER_09]: There are 18 sections that go with it.

461
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:37,503
[SPEAKER_09]: And in those 18 sections, it's very important to understand and to read.

462
00:39:37,944 --> 00:39:43,029
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a great latitude that up to a nine-member board or a commission has with that money.

463
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,072
[SPEAKER_09]: And you as a council haven't even been right into the picture.

464
00:39:46,632 --> 00:39:50,396
[SPEAKER_09]: No public meetings and hearings have been held to find out where and how that money can be spent.

465
00:39:51,154 --> 00:40:03,259
[SPEAKER_09]: While 30% can go to housing, historical, and open space and recreational, the remaining 70% can be likewise used for the same if not similar situations that CPA will approve.

466
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:19,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you folks really need to take a deep hard look at this particular law because as of July 4th, as I said, once people start getting hit with a connectivity fee every other month and then begin to realize that their 1.5%, which is in excess of a million dollars, is being collected here at City Hall,

467
00:40:20,382 --> 00:40:25,205
[SPEAKER_09]: And the state is not giving back the dollar for dollar, as people thought they did when they voted for this.

468
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:30,328
[SPEAKER_09]: That's two unfair taxes being placed upon taxpayers at the present time.

469
00:40:31,449 --> 00:40:42,196
[SPEAKER_09]: The second thing I would like to talk about is the money that, on October 7, 2014, after many weeks of failure.

470
00:40:44,798 --> 00:40:45,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.

471
00:40:46,098 --> 00:40:50,161
[SPEAKER_09]: On October 7, 2014, I don't know what's going on here.

472
00:40:53,547 --> 00:41:10,651
[SPEAKER_09]: on October 7th, 2014, after the then Medford City Council was reviewing Park Medford's application before the city of Medford, and Mayor McGlynn, at that point in time, signed the contract on October 7th, 2014.

473
00:41:12,572 --> 00:41:18,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Five additional addendums were included into that Park Medford contract.

474
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:21,114
[SPEAKER_09]: And the one that stands out is the following, it says,

475
00:41:21,942 --> 00:41:30,069
[SPEAKER_09]: He's recommending $250,000 of the revenue generated on a yearly basis to be dedicated to business district improvements.

476
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:41,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that's a result of the mayor making the comment after deliberating and discussing concerns issued by many business people in the community, the mayor is recommending the following.

477
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:46,442
[SPEAKER_09]: And he did that the same day he made that announcement.

478
00:41:47,543 --> 00:41:48,123
[SPEAKER_09]: On December 18th, 2015,

479
00:41:50,643 --> 00:42:04,648
[SPEAKER_09]: The Mayor sent out a notice to the members of the City Council, which basically said, in part, a representative of each business district will recommend to the Mayor some proposed uses.

480
00:42:05,028 --> 00:42:08,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I respectfully request and recommend that the sum of $250,000 be transferred

481
00:42:10,673 --> 00:42:22,197
[SPEAKER_09]: from the sale of real estate to be used for improvements to the five business districts with kiosks as I recommended earlier this year, which would have been effective calendar year 2016.

482
00:42:23,277 --> 00:42:24,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we go a little bit further.

483
00:42:24,738 --> 00:42:27,358
[SPEAKER_09]: We go to December 23, 2014.

484
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:35,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Once again, in the press release issued by the local press from the mayor's office, it states $250,000 annually would be subject to appropriation

485
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:39,483
[SPEAKER_09]: for district improvements.

486
00:42:40,083 --> 00:42:50,271
[SPEAKER_09]: And as a result of that, that came from then the mayor's secretary, Lisa Evangelista, and she was given that by then budget director, Stephanie Burke.

487
00:42:51,071 --> 00:43:03,240
[SPEAKER_09]: And then lastly, we have on January 24th of 2016, once again, after a signing ceremony of a 10-year contract for the program, Mayor McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue

488
00:43:05,706 --> 00:43:08,247
[SPEAKER_09]: would be used for improvements to business districts.

489
00:43:09,207 --> 00:43:09,947
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the catch.

490
00:43:10,667 --> 00:43:13,648
[SPEAKER_09]: The prior mayor made a commitment to that, Burke said.

491
00:43:14,248 --> 00:43:21,430
[SPEAKER_09]: When we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be about and beyond the fixed amount that we collected.

492
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:28,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, how could that be about and beyond when the mayor specifically said it would come out of your real estate account?

493
00:43:29,092 --> 00:43:30,733
[SPEAKER_09]: Each district right now is $100,000 behind.

494
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:36,434
[SPEAKER_09]: and what they should have been getting for the past two years, inclusive of Medford Square.

495
00:43:37,395 --> 00:43:49,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe as council members, you have a deep responsibility right now to get answers from this mayor as it relates to not only the $50,000 for each square, where is the money?

496
00:43:49,065 --> 00:43:52,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that money should be designated in the real estate account.

497
00:43:53,068 --> 00:43:55,370
[SPEAKER_09]: It's unfair to the business districts in this community.

498
00:43:55,977 --> 00:43:56,937
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an election year.

499
00:43:56,957 --> 00:43:58,778
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to see a lot of puffing going along.

500
00:43:58,998 --> 00:44:00,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're going to do this, and we're going to do that.

501
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:08,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't think any of these districts have seen anything going on right now that makes them a lot better than they were when they first started when Park Medford came in.

502
00:44:08,963 --> 00:44:17,567
[SPEAKER_09]: You're talking about $500,000 that should be accounted for right now that should come out of that account sale of real estate for which the mayor indicated.

503
00:44:18,578 --> 00:44:29,229
[SPEAKER_09]: You folks have not received one document from this administration telling you that that money would not be forthcoming from that account.

504
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:30,830
[SPEAKER_09]: I just think it's unfair.

505
00:44:31,511 --> 00:44:39,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's unfair to the taxpayers, the business people in this community, the Chamber of Commerce, who are all led to believe that that money would be forthcoming and to be there.

506
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I would like to

507
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:48,369
[SPEAKER_09]: ask that someone on the council, maybe all the council members, ask the mayor, where is the money?

508
00:44:49,129 --> 00:44:51,210
[SPEAKER_09]: When is it going to be forthcoming to the business districts?

509
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:53,771
[SPEAKER_09]: And how can we see it?

510
00:44:53,851 --> 00:44:59,033
[SPEAKER_09]: So the people of this community will have an understanding that this city keeps its word.

511
00:44:59,133 --> 00:45:00,753
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just not political puffing.

512
00:45:03,894 --> 00:45:08,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to pass out the site and sections of the law, which we just talked about.

513
00:45:10,236 --> 00:45:11,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you give one to each one, including the clerk?

514
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:17,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to have you look at it, and in the July meeting, I'd like to come back and see what your thoughts are.

515
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:37,890
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, ratepayers in this community are paying an awful lot, not only for their taxes, in their water bills, their sewer bills, now a connectivity fee, you know, and now we're looking at a CPA tax, that all intentions were good, and I think a lot of people would say if we were getting the 100% back from the Commonwealth, we'd be in good shape.

516
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:40,172
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it's only progressed for 18% of this year,

517
00:45:42,231 --> 00:45:44,434
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just unfair to keep it in the Medford tax base.

518
00:45:44,694 --> 00:45:48,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it's $50, $60, $70, $80 a year, that's not the point.

519
00:45:48,218 --> 00:45:49,139
[SPEAKER_09]: It's another tax.

520
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:51,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Another tax that cannot be accounted for.

521
00:45:51,762 --> 00:45:53,744
[SPEAKER_09]: And this one comes from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

522
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:59,090
[SPEAKER_09]: So this would probably be easier for you folks to even deal with because it's not even coming from the city of Medford.

523
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,092
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.

524
00:46:01,662 --> 00:46:08,526
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just think, you know, when you start looking at these things, it's election year, and walking the streets and talking to people all day long, this is what I hear.

525
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are we paying for these things?

526
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:16,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are we paying for a connectivity fee when we have $850,000 in a water and sewer surplus account?

527
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:21,773
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are we paying for a CPA tax when we're not even getting 100% reimbursement?

528
00:46:22,353 --> 00:46:23,994
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just doesn't make any sense.

529
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:27,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you go into the business districts, they're just completely fed up.

530
00:46:27,335 --> 00:46:28,316
[SPEAKER_09]: They just can't understand.

531
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,121
[SPEAKER_09]: what's going on in this building here.

532
00:46:30,501 --> 00:46:31,861
[SPEAKER_09]: There's absolutely no communication.

533
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:37,383
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no transparency as to how and what money is to be spent around here.

534
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:40,545
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be more than happy to answer any question if anybody has it.

535
00:46:41,945 --> 00:46:42,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

536
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:44,366
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

537
00:46:44,386 --> 00:46:49,008
[SPEAKER_15]: To the gentleman at the podium, I do believe, and refresh my memory, because I know you've got a lot of good notes there.

538
00:46:50,128 --> 00:46:54,630
[SPEAKER_15]: At one point in time, the previous administration did put forward a paper for the council to appropriate $250,000.

539
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:55,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't that correct?

540
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:55,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

541
00:46:59,560 --> 00:46:59,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

542
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,220
[SPEAKER_15]: And do you know when that happened?

543
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:07,622
[SPEAKER_09]: December, the first time it came about after the discussions, like I said, it was October 7th, 2014.

544
00:47:07,842 --> 00:47:09,503
[SPEAKER_15]: October 2014.

545
00:47:09,563 --> 00:47:10,623
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when the contract was signed.

546
00:47:10,883 --> 00:47:11,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

547
00:47:11,143 --> 00:47:14,244
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the paper was introduced to the council floor, I believe.

548
00:47:15,305 --> 00:47:17,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it was presented before the council floor.

549
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,666
[SPEAKER_09]: A representative from the mayor's office was here on that particular night.

550
00:47:20,726 --> 00:47:26,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it was in the following January and I believe on January 28th of the following year.

551
00:47:27,572 --> 00:47:28,472
[SPEAKER_09]: the full-blown discussion.

552
00:47:28,752 --> 00:47:30,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Even maybe Mr. Nash was here the other night.

553
00:47:30,193 --> 00:47:30,673
[SPEAKER_09]: I could be wrong.

554
00:47:30,913 --> 00:47:32,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't hold me to it, but we've had so many of those meetings.

555
00:47:33,774 --> 00:47:40,737
[SPEAKER_15]: So there was a request made of the council to incorporate $250,000 to the building districts, but the previous council didn't act on it.

556
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,557
[SPEAKER_09]: The administration absolutely said it.

557
00:47:42,597 --> 00:47:44,898
[SPEAKER_09]: That money was going to be earmarked on an annual basis.

558
00:47:45,328 --> 00:47:48,390
[SPEAKER_09]: from the sale of real estate to the five business districts.

559
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Folks, the previous administration did send us a paper requesting appropriation.

560
00:47:51,191 --> 00:47:51,331
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

561
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:52,212
[SPEAKER_09]: And we got that, as a matter of fact.

562
00:47:52,232 --> 00:47:54,954
[SPEAKER_15]: And then that money was never appropriated because the council failed to act, correct?

563
00:47:54,994 --> 00:47:55,494
[SPEAKER_09]: You never got it.

564
00:47:55,594 --> 00:47:57,275
[SPEAKER_09]: You never got the request to have it appropriated.

565
00:47:58,155 --> 00:48:02,118
[SPEAKER_15]: See, I'm remembering that we got a paper requesting the $250,000 be appropriated.

566
00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:07,381
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I ask, because my recollection is a little bit different than that that was presented.

567
00:48:08,141 --> 00:48:09,602
[SPEAKER_15]: But with that being said, I rest, Mr. President.

568
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:16,875
[SPEAKER_09]: But you have, Mr. President, approximately $500,000 that needs to be accounted for for the years 2016 and coming into 2017.

569
00:48:17,075 --> 00:48:18,176
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot of money.

570
00:48:18,677 --> 00:48:19,217
[SPEAKER_09]: And where is it?

571
00:48:19,357 --> 00:48:21,079
[SPEAKER_09]: And why is it back into the business districts?

572
00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:29,585
[SPEAKER_09]: That's one of the reasons why Mayor McGlynn back then decided to amend it by adding those five additional things into the contract on an annual basis.

573
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:37,872
[SPEAKER_09]: This was going to be out of the sale of real estate, not something over and beyond that for which Park Medford was paying us.

574
00:48:38,403 --> 00:48:40,885
[SPEAKER_09]: as the former budget director, now present mayor, has indicated.

575
00:48:42,626 --> 00:48:43,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

576
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

577
00:48:45,328 --> 00:48:52,773
[SPEAKER_08]: I thank prior Councilor Penter for coming forward and refreshing our memory.

578
00:48:52,793 --> 00:48:57,616
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that, I agree with you, if it should come out of anywhere, it should be the sale of real estate.

579
00:48:57,997 --> 00:49:07,263
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure you're aware, the latest we've heard is that we are going to be asked to vote out of it, take the money out of free cash at some point

580
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:11,118
[SPEAKER_08]: in the near future to give $50,000 to each business district.

581
00:49:11,598 --> 00:49:15,199
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, too, I mean, I feel that it should come out of the budget rather than free cash.

582
00:49:15,279 --> 00:49:17,559
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's the way, that's what's playing out now.

583
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:30,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of that argument, so to speak, back then that was present is it would be on an annual basis that the squares, a representative or representatives from each one of the squares would meet on an annual basis for the purpose.

584
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:34,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, let's just say if they were into their second year, which would be up to $100,000,

585
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:37,672
[SPEAKER_09]: This could be an ongoing project that maybe needs $50,000, $100,000, $150,000.

586
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:42,231
[SPEAKER_09]: and they could be able to correct whatever it's going to be needed.

587
00:49:42,611 --> 00:49:43,811
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's not being done.

588
00:49:44,631 --> 00:49:45,412
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been no meeting.

589
00:49:46,072 --> 00:49:58,736
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been no allowance of the money even to come before the council to be spent and have a presentation said, we're giving this money to Haines Square, this money to West Method, this is what the money is going to be used for, and a representative from each one of the people to come here.

590
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:00,876
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, this is still taxpayers' money.

591
00:50:01,216 --> 00:50:06,738
[SPEAKER_09]: No matter how you want to cut it, no matter how it's garnered, the fact of the matter is you have a responsibility as councillors

592
00:50:07,297 --> 00:50:12,080
[SPEAKER_09]: to say, well, if this is what the deal was, $250,000 a year, you haven't even have it.

593
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:20,846
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't even have a financial report coming back to you, as you've asked on numerous occasions on an annual or semiannual basis, revenue coming in.

594
00:50:21,446 --> 00:50:23,367
[SPEAKER_09]: We could just go on and on.

595
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:26,269
[SPEAKER_09]: But at least on this particular issue, there's nothing.

596
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:29,251
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing to talk about, because there's nothing that's been presented.

597
00:50:30,132 --> 00:50:33,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And going back to the CPA, the fact that Larry, could you just do this, please?

598
00:50:34,595 --> 00:50:35,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you pass them out?

599
00:50:36,015 --> 00:50:36,236
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, OK.

600
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:40,364
[SPEAKER_09]: The thing in the CPA, we're not taking it away from anybody.

601
00:50:40,424 --> 00:50:42,245
[SPEAKER_09]: All we're just saying is you're just going to suspend it.

602
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:53,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you're being told that you're going to get X amount of dollars back for every dollar that you put up, and you're not getting it, why would you want to still keep going back out there and taxing the rate payers?

603
00:50:54,757 --> 00:51:03,044
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're taking the million dollars that you have already now for the first year, and you should ask for an accounting, it would be nice to have someone behind the rail ask for an accounting of how much money

604
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:05,903
[SPEAKER_09]: did the city of Medford take in in its first year?

605
00:51:05,923 --> 00:51:08,543
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going into your second year of a CPA.

606
00:51:09,143 --> 00:51:10,784
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the intent of spending that money?

607
00:51:11,184 --> 00:51:12,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is the committee?

608
00:51:12,604 --> 00:51:13,544
[SPEAKER_09]: What's their findings?

609
00:51:13,844 --> 00:51:15,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the public meeting?

610
00:51:15,345 --> 00:51:16,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the public hearing for input?

611
00:51:18,145 --> 00:51:20,506
[SPEAKER_09]: You're into the second year of it, three years to go.

612
00:51:20,526 --> 00:51:23,246
[SPEAKER_09]: It just doesn't make any sense.

613
00:51:24,046 --> 00:51:24,887
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to read the law.

614
00:51:24,927 --> 00:51:26,487
[SPEAKER_09]: The law is very specific.

615
00:51:27,608 --> 00:51:28,868
[SPEAKER_09]: On the CPA especially.

616
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:34,211
[SPEAKER_09]: After it was passed and introduced, you put anywhere up to a five to a nine member board.

617
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:36,631
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gotta be done right after the fact.

618
00:51:37,472 --> 00:51:38,432
[SPEAKER_09]: You're supposed to have meetings.

619
00:51:38,452 --> 00:51:40,493
[SPEAKER_09]: You're supposed to have this presented to the people.

620
00:51:40,513 --> 00:51:41,673
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a board.

621
00:51:41,693 --> 00:51:42,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Pardon me?

622
00:51:42,194 --> 00:51:42,854
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a board.

623
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:43,994
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a board.

624
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's the public meetings on how to spend the money?

625
00:51:48,076 --> 00:51:48,736
[SPEAKER_09]: They've already had one.

626
00:51:50,057 --> 00:51:50,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you tell me what it was?

627
00:51:50,897 --> 00:51:51,997
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know the date.

628
00:51:52,017 --> 00:51:53,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it a public meeting before the council?

629
00:51:53,738 --> 00:51:53,838
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

630
00:51:54,575 --> 00:51:56,238
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you've got to read and understand.

631
00:51:56,598 --> 00:51:58,321
[SPEAKER_09]: Read the 12 pages that make up the law.

632
00:51:59,022 --> 00:51:59,963
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very specific.

633
00:52:00,544 --> 00:52:04,891
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I'm offering to you is not to abolish it, but just to put it on hold.

634
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:10,199
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're not going to get reimbursed from the state, then why take it out of the taxpayers of this community?

635
00:52:10,718 --> 00:52:13,421
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you can't get it till the end of the fifth year, then so be it.

636
00:52:13,441 --> 00:52:14,783
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a nice try.

637
00:52:15,183 --> 00:52:22,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you look at the makeup on how they go, they go by a population standard, and they also go by a tax rate on the appraised property.

638
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:23,873
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it goes into a skew.

639
00:52:24,653 --> 00:52:26,395
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very complex situation.

640
00:52:27,136 --> 00:52:38,762
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we're generating, Mr. President, over a million dollars a year or thereabouts, and we should be getting that back from the taxpayers of this community, we shouldn't even have to worry about historical things in this community.

641
00:52:39,082 --> 00:52:41,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We shouldn't have to worry about our parks and open and recreation.

642
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:49,267
[SPEAKER_09]: We shouldn't have to worry about doing things in the area of public housing in that area or anything else that CPA would allow you to do.

643
00:52:50,187 --> 00:52:51,267
[SPEAKER_09]: But we don't even know that.

644
00:52:51,348 --> 00:52:54,729
[SPEAKER_09]: None of you know that because you haven't been told what it's going to be used for.

645
00:52:54,969 --> 00:52:56,530
[SPEAKER_09]: You haven't even had any input.

646
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,451
[SPEAKER_09]: This is about as transparent as the number six.

647
00:53:03,512 --> 00:53:03,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

648
00:53:05,553 --> 00:53:06,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Any questions from anybody?

649
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:17,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'll be back in July and hopefully you'll have some kind of an answer to that because if this council feels that they don't want to go forward,

650
00:53:17,509 --> 00:53:29,537
[SPEAKER_09]: then I will just go to the state legislature and ask some representative to pass it, because a lot of these cities and towns, they're starting to feel it now, because people are being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.

651
00:53:29,557 --> 00:53:31,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

652
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:32,579
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

653
00:53:35,601 --> 00:53:36,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

654
00:53:36,021 --> 00:53:37,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

655
00:53:37,102 --> 00:53:37,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

656
00:53:37,202 --> 00:53:40,704
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Joyce Paul, and I'm in 8 Mason Street in Medford.

657
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:44,567
[SPEAKER_07]: I was recently elected to the state committee,

658
00:53:45,304 --> 00:53:50,845
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had no idea how many people would talk to me about how many issues they would talk to me about.

659
00:53:51,625 --> 00:53:53,566
[SPEAKER_07]: And money is the number one.

660
00:53:54,746 --> 00:54:06,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely support Bob Penta saying that if we're supposed to get money back from the state and we're not getting it back, then we need to address that.

661
00:54:07,188 --> 00:54:13,530
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't seem fair to say to people, if you give us 1.5%, the state will match it.

662
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,951
[SPEAKER_07]: And that will be helpful to the area.

663
00:54:18,051 --> 00:54:20,933
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're not getting the money back, we're not getting the money back.

664
00:54:20,993 --> 00:54:22,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not fair to the people.

665
00:54:24,016 --> 00:54:33,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I also support having a little bit more understanding about this $250,000, this $500,000 in the business district.

666
00:54:33,763 --> 00:54:35,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know very much about that.

667
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:40,108
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do know a number of people have talked about the Preservation Act.

668
00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:45,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not sure we all know in any way all the details that you know.

669
00:54:45,633 --> 00:54:54,155
[SPEAKER_07]: but I do think that I would like to see us get a little better care and I don't feel like we're getting, you know, the care that we should.

670
00:54:54,775 --> 00:54:55,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

671
00:54:55,696 --> 00:54:56,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

672
00:55:00,057 --> 00:55:00,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

673
00:55:00,457 --> 00:55:02,157
[SPEAKER_16]: Name and address the director, please.

674
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:03,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

675
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:05,618
[SPEAKER_16]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans street.

676
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:12,500
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to bring up some of the points that Mr. Penta was talking about, excuse me,

677
00:55:13,365 --> 00:55:17,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Tomorrow night, there is a meeting of the Community Preservation Commission.

678
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,866
[SPEAKER_16]: It's at the high school, I believe, at 5 o'clock.

679
00:55:21,446 --> 00:55:29,428
[SPEAKER_16]: The funds collected so far is $1,200,000, as I believe you know from the subcommittee meetings on the budget.

680
00:55:31,148 --> 00:55:36,469
[SPEAKER_16]: What you also know, too, is that, I mean, this also connects to what Lisa was saying.

681
00:55:36,509 --> 00:55:37,409
[SPEAKER_16]: I forget your last name.

682
00:55:37,429 --> 00:55:37,809
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

683
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:41,810
[SPEAKER_16]: The property taxes,

684
00:55:43,897 --> 00:55:48,520
[SPEAKER_16]: in Medford, as the assessor said, are going up an average of 10% to 14%.

685
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:52,963
[SPEAKER_16]: And he said that based on historical records.

686
00:55:53,463 --> 00:55:57,505
[SPEAKER_16]: So the CPA tax is going to be collecting a lot more money, too.

687
00:55:58,526 --> 00:56:03,889
[SPEAKER_16]: One other clarification I want to make is I was opposed to the CPA in 2015.

688
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:10,393
[SPEAKER_16]: And when it passed, the very next day after the election, I went to the Office of Elections

689
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:15,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Secretary of State's office, and I asked them, how do we get rid of this?

690
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,258
[SPEAKER_16]: And they said, you don't.

691
00:56:18,619 --> 00:56:21,062
[SPEAKER_16]: There's only one way after five years.

692
00:56:21,382 --> 00:56:27,230
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, maybe what Mr. Penta said is true, but they didn't tell me that, about the city council being able to put it on the ballot.

693
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:30,514
[SPEAKER_16]: But what was told to me from the Secretary of State's office is,

694
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:36,360
[SPEAKER_16]: It can only get on the ballot to be repealed the same way it got on the ballot to be passed.

695
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:44,162
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's you have to go out in citizen effort drive to go out and get the signatures, to get this thing on the ballot, to get it repealed.

696
00:56:44,842 --> 00:56:54,825
[SPEAKER_16]: And one final thing I want to say about the matching from the state is only half of the cities and towns have the CPA.

697
00:56:55,335 --> 00:57:02,219
[SPEAKER_16]: but all 351 cities and towns pay into the fund that funds the towns that have it.

698
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:13,744
[SPEAKER_16]: So an unfortunate aspect of this is that lesser affluent communities that don't have the CPA end up, through their taxes, funding more affluent towns.

699
00:57:15,645 --> 00:57:17,546
[SPEAKER_16]: We really don't need the CPA.

700
00:57:18,027 --> 00:57:20,268
[SPEAKER_16]: I definitely agree with the purposes of it.

701
00:57:21,048 --> 00:57:24,710
[SPEAKER_16]: The preservation of historical landmarks and open spaces,

702
00:57:25,156 --> 00:57:29,577
[SPEAKER_16]: But Medford already sits on surpluses and budgets.

703
00:57:30,037 --> 00:57:33,918
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a property tax that goes up every single year.

704
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:35,959
[SPEAKER_16]: We have surpluses in other accounts.

705
00:57:36,399 --> 00:57:43,361
[SPEAKER_16]: There are other ways that we can do the objectives of the CPA without having the CPA.

706
00:57:43,581 --> 00:57:49,503
[SPEAKER_16]: And if Mr. Pinter is right of some way of freezing this or reducing it, please,

707
00:57:50,283 --> 00:57:55,531
[SPEAKER_16]: By all means, do that, because as the last speaker said, this is what's on the mind of the people.

708
00:57:55,891 --> 00:58:05,085
[SPEAKER_16]: How are people going to upkeep their properties when they have the connectivity tax coming at them?

709
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:14,547
[SPEAKER_16]: when they have the perpetual property tax, when they have the meals tax, and the sales tax, and two income taxes, and fees to go to Wrights Pond, and fees for this, that, and the other thing.

710
00:58:15,047 --> 00:58:15,927
[SPEAKER_16]: Gene Neuzil's right.

711
00:58:16,247 --> 00:58:18,748
[SPEAKER_16]: This is death by paper cuts.

712
00:58:19,308 --> 00:58:23,708
[SPEAKER_16]: And this body has the power to do something about that.

713
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:25,409
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, these are our neighbors.

714
00:58:25,889 --> 00:58:28,109
[SPEAKER_16]: We know the people who own these restaurants out here.

715
00:58:28,389 --> 00:58:29,930
[SPEAKER_16]: We grew up here, our whole lives.

716
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:31,870
[SPEAKER_16]: Please, common sense.

717
00:58:32,366 --> 00:58:33,587
[SPEAKER_16]: Please, thank you, Mr. President.

718
00:58:33,647 --> 00:58:34,828
[SPEAKER_16]: It was voted on by the people.

719
00:58:34,868 --> 00:58:37,690
[SPEAKER_16]: If you can get it repealed, we'll review the paper.

720
00:58:39,151 --> 00:58:40,052
[SPEAKER_16]: The people voted it in.

721
00:58:40,332 --> 00:58:54,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, and I sat at a polling center on election day, and as people came in, Mr. President, and they looked at that doctor's prescription of a ballot question, they went up to the poll worker and they said, hey, can you explain this to me?

722
00:58:54,644 --> 00:58:58,807
[SPEAKER_16]: And when they were told, basically, it's a surcharge on your profit, oh, I'm not voting for that.

723
00:59:00,125 --> 00:59:00,745
[SPEAKER_16]: You're right, you're right.

724
00:59:00,785 --> 00:59:05,387
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a citizen effort drive, and kudos to Roberta Kammerer for what she did.

725
00:59:05,847 --> 00:59:09,308
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't agree with the CPA, but I definitely admire her efforts.

726
00:59:09,528 --> 00:59:10,528
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a job well done.

727
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:22,492
[SPEAKER_16]: But it was also done in a way that wasn't specifically clear to the voters of this community as to what was actually going to happen.

728
00:59:23,112 --> 00:59:26,433
[SPEAKER_16]: And that, you're right, it was voted on by the people.

729
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:28,563
[SPEAKER_16]: What did he say?

730
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:30,584
[SPEAKER_16]: 1,300 people didn't even vote on it.

731
00:59:30,944 --> 00:59:32,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Most people didn't even turn it over.

732
00:59:33,065 --> 00:59:40,488
[SPEAKER_16]: More effort should be made to clarify exactly what was being voting on, and that there was even a ballot question.

733
00:59:40,908 --> 00:59:41,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

734
00:59:41,488 --> 00:59:41,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

735
00:59:41,889 --> 00:59:44,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

736
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:46,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

737
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:47,711
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 281 Park Street.

738
00:59:48,371 --> 00:59:52,973
[SPEAKER_01]: And the CPA did pass, much to my dismay.

739
00:59:53,754 --> 00:59:57,295
[SPEAKER_01]: because I didn't feel that the question was as clear and everyone had the information.

740
00:59:57,335 --> 01:00:03,337
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that it has passed, when I heard of the Riverside Plaza, I thought, oh, that's a perfect use of our CPA funds.

741
01:00:03,837 --> 01:00:12,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping that there's some way that maybe this commission can say, you know what, let's pay for that Riverside Plaza, even if we have to delay the start of it a few months.

742
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:21,607
[SPEAKER_01]: and take that $250,000 and put it back into the budget and maybe pave four or five roads in the city and beautify the area.

743
01:00:21,687 --> 01:00:26,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Because who wants to go to a park that's surrounded by streets that are filled with potholes?

744
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:29,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can cover up that railway line on Salem Street.

745
01:00:29,652 --> 01:00:40,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we have a specific fund that is created for parkland, historic and low income, then that is definitely the first place that we should go for that.

746
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:46,805
[SPEAKER_01]: A half a million dollar project that's funded partially by grant money could be completely funded if we use the CPA money.

747
01:00:47,406 --> 01:00:50,488
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be a benefit to the community since that has passed.

748
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:51,949
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that will happen.

749
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:56,312
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a meeting tomorrow night at 630 at the high school, the superintendent's conference room.

750
01:00:56,953 --> 01:01:01,376
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go there and make your suggestions to the members of the committee.

751
01:01:01,737 --> 01:01:02,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

752
01:01:02,237 --> 01:01:02,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

753
01:01:02,597 --> 01:01:07,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

754
01:01:07,781 --> 01:01:08,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Andrew Castagnetti.

755
01:01:09,435 --> 01:01:11,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Cushion Street, Method, Massachusetts.

756
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:23,920
[SPEAKER_12]: The CPA tax, it does not hurt me that much at $60 a year approximate versus the $6,000 per year with the real estate tax.

757
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:34,543
[SPEAKER_12]: So putting it on a scale, on a scheme of things, I would like to see my owner occupy real estate tax exemption pass at the full 35%.

758
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:38,985
[SPEAKER_12]: The state would give us, and that would

759
01:01:40,135 --> 01:01:57,622
[SPEAKER_12]: save us the $400 future increase under Prop 2 1⁄2 and reduce it $400, which would be $800 savings that we've missed out for many, many, many years, as Somerville and Malden has been doing so, if you lived in one house, your own house.

760
01:01:59,303 --> 01:02:02,604
[SPEAKER_12]: And as far as the CPA, the vote was

761
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:20,078
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how to explain it, but it was on page two, and it seemed like 10,500 people voted for the mayorship, and it seems to me about only 8,500 voted for the CPA.

762
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:23,480
[SPEAKER_12]: To me, it was about $2,000 on my memory.

763
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,261
[SPEAKER_12]: That never turned it over.

764
01:02:26,922 --> 01:02:30,924
[SPEAKER_12]: And CPA tax is supposed to be used if it ever gets used,

765
01:02:33,532 --> 01:02:36,314
[SPEAKER_12]: And for one is open space.

766
01:02:36,394 --> 01:02:46,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, all of a sudden we possibly have a dirty 21E where I want my bike path to go the one half mile out of the 20 miles that's already built.

767
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:52,062
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one twentieth is incomplete, and that's right behind your council president.

768
01:02:54,283 --> 01:02:55,384
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't understand that.

769
01:02:55,744 --> 01:02:58,326
[SPEAKER_12]: If there is a dirty 21E, that is open space.

770
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:02,428
[SPEAKER_12]: And if someone started to dig around there for whatever reason,

771
01:03:03,317 --> 01:03:06,458
[SPEAKER_12]: why it was initiated and found arsenic and lead.

772
01:03:07,878 --> 01:03:08,558
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't like that.

773
01:03:09,698 --> 01:03:16,920
[SPEAKER_12]: And as Brianna was quoted in the transcript, which I finally read today, that what about the soccer fields over there?

774
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:24,701
[SPEAKER_12]: And I had said previously at one of these meetings, well, how about those pastor already there by the proposed new dog park?

775
01:03:26,762 --> 01:03:30,183
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't understand this country and the city.

776
01:03:30,883 --> 01:03:31,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Something is amiss.

777
01:03:33,528 --> 01:03:41,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Tomorrow night at 6.30 at the CPA meeting at the superintendent's conference room at Medford High School.

778
01:03:42,254 --> 01:03:43,635
[SPEAKER_12]: That's too far for my bicycle.

779
01:03:43,675 --> 01:03:44,195
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, sir.

780
01:03:44,576 --> 01:03:45,356
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

781
01:03:45,376 --> 01:03:52,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I'd like to have a point of clarification.

782
01:03:54,022 --> 01:04:00,647
[SPEAKER_09]: The two sections that I'm referring to on the section 18, basically what the proposal says is as follows.

783
01:04:01,491 --> 01:04:22,836
[SPEAKER_09]: At any time after imposition of the surcharge, the legislative body may approve by way of a vote to put on hold any local surcharge tax that cannot receive the matching dollar amount from the state upon population rank in real estate property tax levy calculation, as promulgated by Chapter 44B of the Massachusetts state statute.

784
01:04:23,536 --> 01:04:28,997
[SPEAKER_09]: This allows citizen taxpayers to their fair return of their tax payments until such time

785
01:04:29,464 --> 01:04:38,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Until such time, the state has the ability to match the intent and return amount as originally intended, as legislated, and voted upon.

786
01:04:39,071 --> 01:04:40,192
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not killing it.

787
01:04:40,272 --> 01:04:45,716
[SPEAKER_09]: All it's doing is, how can you tax somebody for something that you're not getting for what you're supposed to be getting?

788
01:04:46,236 --> 01:04:57,945
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second part of it is basically saying, very simply, at the end of five years, after the date of approval, and after Sections 3 to 7, which is inclusive, have been accepted by the city or town,

789
01:04:58,658 --> 01:05:04,239
[SPEAKER_09]: said sections shall come to an end, and the surcharge imposed for the past five years shall end.

790
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:22,624
[SPEAKER_09]: If the city or town want to continue on with sections three to seven, that's the inclusive part for which the city of Medford accepted of the Preservation Act, said act shall once again be placed upon the ballot for the taxpayers to vote upon, just the way it was the first time to be voted upon in November of 2015.

791
01:05:22,684 --> 01:05:27,465
[SPEAKER_09]: That's fair, but to turn around and leave the law the way it is,

792
01:05:28,183 --> 01:05:33,245
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to take it off, you've got to go out there and get the signatures to have the people voted off.

793
01:05:33,506 --> 01:05:35,066
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't think that's right.

794
01:05:35,527 --> 01:05:36,947
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a sunset legislation.

795
01:05:37,387 --> 01:05:39,128
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what it should be after five years.

796
01:05:39,448 --> 01:05:46,692
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it's really working out that if it's working out that well, then maybe the taxpayers will vote it and maybe the taxpayers won't.

797
01:05:47,232 --> 01:05:51,514
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you don't give them that chance in that choice, this will just keep going on at it for an item.

798
01:05:51,794 --> 01:05:56,016
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a tax that'll never end because it doesn't have the opportunity to end.

799
01:05:56,857 --> 01:05:57,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

800
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:04,302
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

801
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,822
[SPEAKER_05]: To receive and place on file.

802
01:06:08,743 --> 01:06:09,263
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

803
01:06:10,003 --> 01:06:11,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

804
01:06:11,484 --> 01:06:12,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.

805
01:06:12,784 --> 01:06:12,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

806
01:06:12,984 --> 01:06:14,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passed.

807
01:06:14,685 --> 01:06:16,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I heard that.

808
01:06:16,745 --> 01:06:18,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, it's just as a point of inquiry.

809
01:06:19,006 --> 01:06:19,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of inquiry, please.

810
01:06:22,007 --> 01:06:23,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand they just received it and placed it on a file.

811
01:06:24,007 --> 01:06:27,028
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked the council to review it so we could have a discussion.

812
01:06:27,532 --> 01:06:30,113
[SPEAKER_09]: We could review it for discussion for the July meeting.

813
01:06:31,794 --> 01:06:32,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

814
01:06:33,575 --> 01:06:35,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

815
01:06:35,957 --> 01:06:39,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any way you can put the argument in writing for us?

816
01:06:39,118 --> 01:06:39,359
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.

817
01:06:40,339 --> 01:06:40,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I gave it to you.

818
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I just have, like, just this?

819
01:06:43,101 --> 01:06:45,782
[SPEAKER_09]: One is present, and the other one is proposed.

820
01:06:45,922 --> 01:06:46,943
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the section of the law.

821
01:06:48,844 --> 01:06:50,605
[SPEAKER_09]: To the left on the top, it'll say present.

822
01:06:51,045 --> 01:06:52,486
[SPEAKER_09]: And the next one down says proposed.

823
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:54,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Has the matter been disposed of?

824
01:06:54,567 --> 01:06:54,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it has.

825
01:06:55,842 --> 01:07:03,347
[SPEAKER_08]: but I'd like to just know exactly the argument, not necessarily the law of what you believe the city council can do.

826
01:07:03,467 --> 01:07:06,149
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want, I will send you a letter as it relates to that.

827
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:06,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

828
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:07,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

829
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:08,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

830
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:11,033
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry to interrupt you, Councilor Dello Russo.

831
01:07:11,053 --> 01:07:12,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

832
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:16,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk by Councilor Dello Russo.

833
01:07:18,918 --> 01:07:21,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved

834
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:26,565
[SPEAKER_05]: that the city council discuss concerns with Airbnbs.

835
01:07:27,365 --> 01:07:28,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

836
01:07:28,946 --> 01:07:29,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

837
01:07:29,706 --> 01:07:36,549
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that we've talked about this issue in recent past, but I just wanted to revisit this.

838
01:07:36,669 --> 01:07:51,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a few phone calls from a few constituents that were very concerned that we have a functioning Airbnb in our neighborhoods, probably more than one, and we're not,

839
01:07:52,326 --> 01:08:07,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're really not following what's happening in those areas and look into, you know, any ordinances or rules or any health codes that have to be passed.

840
01:08:07,335 --> 01:08:18,322
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can, I don't know if we can ask the, if we can look at what subcommittee we can move this to if we can.

841
01:08:19,163 --> 01:08:20,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we already have this paper in subcommittee.

842
01:08:20,904 --> 01:08:24,165
[SPEAKER_05]: It still is.

843
01:08:24,185 --> 01:08:25,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

844
01:08:25,086 --> 01:08:25,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Which one is it?

845
01:08:25,646 --> 01:08:26,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you remember?

846
01:08:26,707 --> 01:08:28,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight, I think you can refer to that.

847
01:08:28,328 --> 01:08:30,909
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was you that proposed it.

848
01:08:30,969 --> 01:08:36,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I've actually drafted a draft ordinance regulating short-term rentals.

849
01:08:36,512 --> 01:08:38,232
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just putting the finishing touches on it.

850
01:08:38,272 --> 01:08:41,994
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm actually waiting for a little bit of feedback from two neighboring communities.

851
01:08:42,054 --> 01:08:44,195
[SPEAKER_15]: And once I received that information, I was going to produce a paper.

852
01:08:44,996 --> 01:08:47,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Ultimately, the paper that I put together with the proposal was to

853
01:08:48,793 --> 01:08:50,815
[SPEAKER_15]: require a short-term rental operator's license.

854
01:08:52,556 --> 01:08:56,720
[SPEAKER_15]: And we define a short-term rental as a book stay of 29 consecutive nights or fewer.

855
01:08:57,501 --> 01:09:05,088
[SPEAKER_15]: The state's division of local services has offered a number of opinions on this relative to whether or not we can tax them as a motel or as a short-term lodging facility.

856
01:09:05,128 --> 01:09:12,015
[SPEAKER_15]: So there are some technical questions and some technical expertise that's going to be required, Mr. President, before we can put together a working ordinance.

857
01:09:12,995 --> 01:09:22,217
[SPEAKER_15]: In my research, one of the other things I found is that in a lot of places, they've drafted and implemented ordinances that are so restrictive that they make it impossible to enforce.

858
01:09:22,257 --> 01:09:24,778
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's something that I think we need to take a look at as well.

859
01:09:24,838 --> 01:09:30,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if we're going to craft an ordinance, we're going to have to craft something that's going to be able to be enforced.

860
01:09:30,419 --> 01:09:35,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Because if it's an ordinance that can't be enforced, people are going to continue with their behavior, and they're not going to comply with the regulations.

861
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:40,941
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's been several conversations that I've had between you and I, actually, because we were both working on this together.

862
01:09:41,898 --> 01:09:42,659
[SPEAKER_15]: to address the issue.

863
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:48,804
[SPEAKER_15]: But I thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing it up and I can send him a copy of the draft proposal as soon as the finishing touches are put on it.

864
01:09:49,204 --> 01:09:52,066
[SPEAKER_05]: At least for safety reasons anyways, no other reason.

865
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:54,888
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can, and I appreciate that.

866
01:09:54,908 --> 01:10:00,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that Councilor Knight does an unbelievable job with his homework.

867
01:10:00,432 --> 01:10:01,533
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's very important.

868
01:10:01,553 --> 01:10:10,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the concerns loud and clear about safety and letting our public safety officials, fire, police know what's going on.

869
01:10:11,171 --> 01:10:12,672
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, we don't have that.

870
01:10:12,712 --> 01:10:13,813
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate your effort.

871
01:10:13,933 --> 01:10:18,076
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will let those residents know that we'll have something soon.

872
01:10:18,216 --> 01:10:18,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

873
01:10:19,477 --> 01:10:19,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

874
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:31,005
[SPEAKER_15]: A couple of the items that are being looked at would be an annual license, a residency requirement for the operator that has to reside in the property.

875
01:10:32,626 --> 01:10:36,609
[SPEAKER_15]: On-site and off-street parking must be made available and utilized for all patrons in their vehicles.

876
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:38,611
[SPEAKER_15]: So on-site, off-street parking.

877
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,372
[SPEAKER_15]: That means that they're not going to be parking in neighborhoods.

878
01:10:41,312 --> 01:10:43,333
[SPEAKER_15]: No more than two adults per bedroom per stay.

879
01:10:43,933 --> 01:10:47,654
[SPEAKER_15]: No more than foreign-related individuals staying during the same stay.

880
01:10:48,275 --> 01:10:54,357
[SPEAKER_15]: The provision of a copy of the noise, trash, and parking ordinances posted inside the rental dwelling and included in the rental contract.

881
01:10:55,577 --> 01:11:01,619
[SPEAKER_15]: The provision of a 24-7 emergency contact hotline for all the neighbors to be posted on the front door in case anything happens.

882
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:09,582
[SPEAKER_15]: A physical safety inspection of the dwelling by the city on a quarterly basis, the cost of which will be borne by the short-term operator.

883
01:11:10,617 --> 01:11:30,046
[SPEAKER_15]: the ability for the city to institute discipline that's progressive up to and including fines and the revocation of license, and the requirements for a general liability insurance policy, Mr. President, and a figure that has to be determined to ensure that personal property and individuals that are staying in the place are protected appropriately.

884
01:11:30,106 --> 01:11:32,867
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are some of the things that we've looked at thus far.

885
01:11:33,347 --> 01:11:33,627
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

886
01:11:34,608 --> 01:11:35,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

887
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:36,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

888
01:11:37,029 --> 01:11:39,390
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to thank Councilor Scott Pollack for bringing this forward.

889
01:11:39,818 --> 01:11:43,100
[SPEAKER_11]: This actually did come up at the last community police meeting.

890
01:11:43,481 --> 01:11:48,824
[SPEAKER_11]: There were a number of residents from actually different sections of the city, different neighborhoods, that had that same concern.

891
01:11:48,864 --> 01:11:50,626
[SPEAKER_11]: And it really does impact the quality of life.

892
01:11:50,646 --> 01:11:52,007
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, take a look.

893
01:11:52,027 --> 01:11:59,432
[SPEAKER_11]: You have more cars on the road, more cars parked in overcrowded neighborhoods, cars coming and going at different times of the day and night.

894
01:11:59,912 --> 01:12:01,633
[SPEAKER_11]: So it really does become disruptive.

895
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,936
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that we need to make sure we do have an ordinance in place.

896
01:12:04,996 --> 01:12:07,518
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad that Councilor Knight has been working on this.

897
01:12:08,472 --> 01:12:14,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully we can meet soon to review this in a subcommittee, but it's something I definitely support.

898
01:12:14,677 --> 01:12:16,618
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thank my colleague for bringing it forward.

899
01:12:16,638 --> 01:12:21,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I think last time I looked, I think there was like 74 B&Bs operating in the city of Medford.

900
01:12:21,762 --> 01:12:22,303
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot.

901
01:12:22,343 --> 01:12:25,785
[SPEAKER_05]: This is becoming the Uber of houses.

902
01:12:26,586 --> 01:12:26,826
[SPEAKER_11]: Correct.

903
01:12:26,906 --> 01:12:29,989
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's a major concern and it does impact all neighborhoods.

904
01:12:30,029 --> 01:12:32,571
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's something that we need to look at sooner than later.

905
01:12:33,572 --> 01:12:33,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

906
01:12:35,335 --> 01:12:41,957
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Layton.

907
01:12:42,077 --> 01:12:44,878
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to amend the paper, Mr. President, and get an update from our state delegation.

908
01:12:44,918 --> 01:12:49,659
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that there was a paper going through the House of Representatives to regulate short-term leases.

909
01:12:49,719 --> 01:12:52,780
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that there was also a paper in the Senate that was very different that was going through.

910
01:12:52,840 --> 01:13:03,023
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we could get an update from our state delegation as to the deliberations regarding any implementation of state law, I think that would be helpful as we look forward to constructing our local ordinance.

911
01:13:03,223 --> 01:13:04,663
[SPEAKER_15]: It needs to comply with the state standard.

912
01:13:05,472 --> 01:13:05,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

913
01:13:06,473 --> 01:13:07,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

914
01:13:08,034 --> 01:13:09,534
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

915
01:13:09,574 --> 01:13:13,177
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could just make sure that the whole council gets a copy.

916
01:13:13,217 --> 01:13:16,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's going to go to subcommittee and Councilor Knight's working on it.

917
01:13:16,258 --> 01:13:21,321
[SPEAKER_08]: If we could just all get a copy so we can review it in the next month or so, that would be great.

918
01:13:22,082 --> 01:13:24,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to give you the next one to watch coming down the line.

919
01:13:24,603 --> 01:13:25,184
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Tackler.

920
01:13:26,224 --> 01:13:33,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Tackler is an app that allows anybody to do anything on license plumbers, cabinet electricians, to do work on people's houses.

921
01:13:34,487 --> 01:13:36,128
[SPEAKER_05]: just by going on that.

922
01:13:36,349 --> 01:13:38,030
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be coming down the line next, you'll watch.

923
01:13:41,392 --> 01:13:48,258
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Alango-Kern.

924
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:52,361
[SPEAKER_05]: And by Councilor Knight.

925
01:13:53,342 --> 01:13:54,183
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

926
01:13:55,424 --> 01:13:56,524
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

927
01:13:57,926 --> 01:14:00,668
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor Dello Russo.

928
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:12,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council offers sincere condolences to the family of the late Philip Harko, longtime Democratic committee chairperson or chairman.

929
01:14:13,727 --> 01:14:16,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have one other also, Councilor Dello Russo.

930
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:24,514
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could, before we take the next one, speak, Philip Harko was a, he's retired.

931
01:14:24,554 --> 01:14:29,157
[SPEAKER_03]: He had retired to Florida recently and passed away unexpectedly down there.

932
01:14:29,762 --> 01:14:32,984
[SPEAKER_03]: He comes from a very dedicated family in the city of Medford.

933
01:14:33,765 --> 01:14:39,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he was very active in, in democratic, uh, uh, local politics.

934
01:14:39,569 --> 01:14:44,052
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a fierce campaigner, a one time candidate himself for the school committee.

935
01:14:44,532 --> 01:14:47,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, his brother Steve served on the school committee for many, several years.

936
01:14:47,994 --> 01:14:55,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, he comes from a very dedicated family and, uh, they were up for his funeral, uh, this week.

937
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:57,821
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, he was a decent man.

938
01:14:58,518 --> 01:15:02,620
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a happy retirement, and the city was blessed by his activity here.

939
01:15:03,481 --> 01:15:04,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Dello Russo.

940
01:15:05,662 --> 01:15:06,362
[SPEAKER_05]: We have one more.

941
01:15:06,842 --> 01:15:19,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor Dello Russo and President Caraviello, it would be resolved that the Medford City Council offer sincere condolences to the family of Peter Taki Kolias, late proprietor of the Metz Donuts, on his recent passing.

942
01:15:20,609 --> 01:15:21,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Dello Russo.

943
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we're both frequenters of there.

944
01:15:26,903 --> 01:15:43,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Taki, as he was known by so many people, is a immigrant to the United States, a hardworking man, worked in the restaurant business, opened up his own coffee shop, developed recipes, and produced one of the finest donuts in greater Boston.

945
01:15:44,395 --> 01:15:48,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Award winning many times, and those of us who have had them know why.

946
01:15:49,559 --> 01:15:50,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very good.

947
01:15:50,699 --> 01:15:52,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Decent family man, heart of gold,

948
01:15:53,897 --> 01:15:56,059
[SPEAKER_03]: and a good businessman, and he'll be missed as well.

949
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:56,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Dela Rosa.

950
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,442
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could all rise for a moment of silence, please.

951
01:16:09,751 --> 01:16:10,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

952
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:16,377
[SPEAKER_05]: We have two papers here that were in committee. 17.

953
01:16:23,703 --> 01:16:23,823
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-513.

954
01:16:23,843 --> 01:16:24,003
[SPEAKER_05]: 17-513.

955
01:16:24,023 --> 01:16:46,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Mr. President and City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that the honorable body appropriate $188,400 from the sale of Lawson Graves' account to the Cemetery Department's salary account.

956
01:16:46,841 --> 01:16:51,485
[SPEAKER_05]: This recommended appropriation is requested in accordance with the fiscal 18-year budget.

957
01:16:53,457 --> 01:16:59,639
[SPEAKER_05]: The department's salary account is reduced each year in anticipation of appropriation from sales of lots and graves.

958
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:11,043
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition, I respectfully request and recommend that your honor body appropriate 181,000, 186,861 from the perpetual care to the cemetery department expense budget.

959
01:17:11,303 --> 01:17:15,345
[SPEAKER_05]: This recommended appropriation is requested in accordance with the fiscal 2018 budget.

960
01:17:16,973 --> 01:17:23,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Cemetery expense budget is reduced each year in anticipation of an appropriation from Perpetual Care.

961
01:17:24,879 --> 01:17:32,885
[SPEAKER_05]: In anticipation of the upcoming budget hearings, I respectfully request that this be forwarded to the Committee of the Whole for a budget hearing.

962
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:39,850
[SPEAKER_05]: We had that hearing this evening and it was passed.

[SPEAKER_05]: 17-514.

984
01:18:13,458 --> 01:18:19,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve the following transfer.

985
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:26,529
[SPEAKER_05]: $900,000 to be transferred from Water Reclaim Earnings to accounts 340-450-5780-000-000-867-2017 Water Capital Project.

986
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:30,472
[SPEAKER_05]: The amount of $900,000 is requested to purchase a water main leak detection system

987
01:18:41,945 --> 01:18:46,627
[SPEAKER_05]: as was displayed in a meeting earlier this year with the Water and Soil Commissioners.

988
01:18:46,927 --> 01:18:53,489
[SPEAKER_05]: We strongly believe that this purchase will not only save dollars to this community.

989
01:18:53,949 --> 01:19:00,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I respectfully request that this paper be forwarded to the Committee of the Whole for deliberation during the budget hearing process.

990
01:19:01,431 --> 01:19:07,133
[SPEAKER_05]: The balance remaining in the water retained earnings after this transfer will be $2 million

991
01:19:08,654 --> 01:19:13,816
[SPEAKER_05]: 769199.

992
01:19:08,954 --> 01:19:13,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Sincerely, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

993
01:19:14,957 --> 01:19:19,658
[SPEAKER_05]: We spoke on this earlier this evening, and the paper was adopted.

994
01:19:20,659 --> 01:19:22,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have a motion to accept this paper?

995
01:19:22,439 --> 01:19:23,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Move approval, Mr. President.

996
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Donald Russo.

997
01:19:27,701 --> 01:19:28,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

998
01:19:30,963 --> 01:19:32,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Councilor Marks.

999
01:19:33,163 --> 01:19:33,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1000
01:19:34,004 --> 01:19:36,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for the edification of the people at home,

1001
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:41,712
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a long-standing issue in the community, leak detection.

1002
01:19:41,772 --> 01:19:46,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I know former Councilor Penta, this was a big issue of his.

1003
01:19:48,555 --> 01:20:00,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Common rate now, Mr. President, it ranges, but the last estimates we received from the MWRA is roughly 17 to 20 percent of our water in the community is unaccounted-for water.

1004
01:20:00,842 --> 01:20:05,644
[SPEAKER_04]: And each and every ratepayer pays additional on their bill for this unaccounted-for water.

1005
01:20:06,169 --> 01:20:11,153
[SPEAKER_04]: This particular new system is a technology that is an acoustic whistle.

1006
01:20:11,953 --> 01:20:19,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a device they put on the water mains and the gape valves, and it pinpoints where leaks are throughout the entire city.

1007
01:20:20,259 --> 01:20:24,803
[SPEAKER_04]: And roughly 90% of the leaks that we have out there don't surface.

1008
01:20:25,283 --> 01:20:27,605
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are underground leaks that we're not aware of.

1009
01:20:28,325 --> 01:20:35,050
[SPEAKER_04]: And according to the company that we met with, Aklar Technologies, the city over a five year period

1010
01:20:35,632 --> 01:20:49,854
[SPEAKER_04]: If we spot out these leaks and fix the leaks, we could save roughly $5 million from this $900,000 investment and roughly 15,000 gallons — 15 million gallons of water annually.

1011
01:20:50,355 --> 01:21:00,656
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I would ask, Mr. President, in the interest of moving this forward on behalf of the beleaguered ratepayers of water and sewer in this community, we move this forward.

1012
01:21:00,976 --> 01:21:04,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I would also ask, Mr. President, that we get a report back because

1013
01:21:05,424 --> 01:21:15,677
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a great system and we're going to be alerted of many new leaks that we're not aware of and we also need the capability within our water and sewer department to follow up on these leaks.

1014
01:21:16,407 --> 01:21:25,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have yet to see any new additional water and sewer employees with the main focus of this particular project in the budget.

1015
01:21:25,311 --> 01:21:40,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I also ask, Mr. President, that part of the water unaccounted for in this community, some of its leaks, other of the unaccounted for water is the fact that our whole school department is not paying for water, even though it's needed.

1016
01:21:41,297 --> 01:21:42,658
[SPEAKER_04]: That's considered unaccounted for.

1017
01:21:43,139 --> 01:21:52,705
[SPEAKER_04]: and every municipal building, even though it's meted, is still not being charged, and we don't include that in our operating expense under the budget, which it should be.

1018
01:21:53,065 --> 01:21:55,467
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be an operating expense in the budget.

1019
01:21:55,787 --> 01:21:59,049
[SPEAKER_04]: We've already sat through the budget side on the municipal side.

1020
01:21:59,469 --> 01:22:06,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't see any additional money for water or sewer on the city side, and tomorrow night we're meeting with the schools.

1021
01:22:07,354 --> 01:22:11,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna ask that question, but I guarantee ya, it's not part of the operating expense

1022
01:22:12,063 --> 01:22:13,684
[SPEAKER_04]: of the school side, Mr. President.

1023
01:22:14,165 --> 01:22:20,589
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we really want to get a handle on unaccounted for water, to me, that's hydrants, that is leaks.

1024
01:22:21,230 --> 01:22:22,811
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not needed property.

1025
01:22:22,931 --> 01:22:24,312
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not unaccounted for.

1026
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:29,876
[SPEAKER_04]: When I can tell how much money and how much water you're using, that's not unaccounted for.

1027
01:22:30,157 --> 01:22:32,278
[SPEAKER_04]: That's accounted for, Mr. President.

1028
01:22:32,498 --> 01:22:36,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Like every taxpayer and ratepayer in this community, their water is accounted for.

1029
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:43,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'd be nice to have a budget where you don't have to put that in as an operating expense, but that's not reality.

1030
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,261
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not reality, Mr. President.

1031
01:22:46,581 --> 01:22:51,444
[SPEAKER_04]: That's hold the school department and the municipal side accountable for the water they use.

1032
01:22:52,024 --> 01:22:53,185
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no incentive there.

1033
01:22:54,486 --> 01:22:56,327
[SPEAKER_04]: They can let the faucets run all night here.

1034
01:22:56,587 --> 01:22:57,167
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't care.

1035
01:22:57,467 --> 01:22:59,008
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets put onto the rate payers.

1036
01:23:00,449 --> 01:23:02,450
[SPEAKER_04]: So Mr. President, we really need to address that.

1037
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:04,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy we're moving forward on this.

1038
01:23:05,233 --> 01:23:11,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I also think, as I mentioned, I&I inflow and infiltration with the sewer department, with our sewer pipes.

1039
01:23:12,218 --> 01:23:19,662
[SPEAKER_04]: It's costing the rate payers millions of dollars a year to treat groundwater that's seeping into our sewer pipes as raw sewage.

1040
01:23:19,923 --> 01:23:22,404
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a huge issue that needs to be addressed.

1041
01:23:22,724 --> 01:23:24,205
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one step in the process.

1042
01:23:24,886 --> 01:23:27,487
[SPEAKER_04]: But it has to be accompanied with additional personnel.

1043
01:23:27,788 --> 01:23:29,589
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

1044
01:23:29,829 --> 01:23:31,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we already voted on this a couple of weeks ago.

1045
01:23:32,951 --> 01:23:34,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we get a response back, Mr. Clerk?

1046
01:23:35,712 --> 01:23:36,612
[SPEAKER_04]: on our recommendation?

1047
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,394
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there was a resolution offered a few weeks ago.

1048
01:23:41,454 --> 01:23:43,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was the same exact resolution.

1049
01:23:43,515 --> 01:23:43,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1050
01:23:43,855 --> 01:23:45,076
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we, I think it came with this.

1051
01:23:45,116 --> 01:23:45,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1052
01:23:46,036 --> 01:23:47,377
[SPEAKER_04]: So we haven't got a response from that.

1053
01:23:47,557 --> 01:23:48,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1054
01:23:49,398 --> 01:23:50,958
[SPEAKER_04]: So we should get a response soon.

1055
01:23:51,279 --> 01:24:00,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President on the, why the schools and the municipal side, uh, are not paying through their operating expense of the budget on the motion.

1056
01:24:01,143 --> 01:24:01,543
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

1057
01:24:02,129 --> 01:24:03,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

1058
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:05,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, just real quick.

1059
01:24:06,092 --> 01:24:10,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to point out, I know that this is Debbie Downer time, but it's a hidden tax.

1060
01:24:11,636 --> 01:24:18,200
[SPEAKER_00]: When the water is put on through the water rate payers, it's another hidden tax, and it gets around Prop 2.5.

1061
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,001
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just wanted to make everybody aware of that.

1062
01:24:20,282 --> 01:24:23,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I know nobody wants to hear that because it's not good news, but it's a hidden tax.

1063
01:24:23,804 --> 01:24:26,266
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's all I wanted to say.

1064
01:24:26,346 --> 01:24:26,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1065
01:24:26,866 --> 01:24:27,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1066
01:24:30,108 --> 01:24:32,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, Bob Henton, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

1067
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:35,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Two components on this particular issue, and I'm glad it's coming up now.

1068
01:24:37,014 --> 01:24:41,317
[SPEAKER_09]: The first one is, I think it's about $112,000.

1069
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:43,779
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all that it would cost.

1070
01:24:43,859 --> 01:24:48,503
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what we were led to believe and what we were told when we changed over from the old metering system to the new one.

1071
01:24:49,048 --> 01:24:59,735
[SPEAKER_09]: to have a computerization program upstairs in the engineer's office that would detect and identify anybody's house in the city of Medford where water would be constantly running or wherever a leak might be.

1072
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:08,140
[SPEAKER_09]: And on a daily basis, it would be reviewed, and that homeowner, taxpayer, ratepayer, would be identified either by a phone call or an email or what have you.

1073
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:10,421
[SPEAKER_09]: That still hasn't taken place.

1074
01:25:10,882 --> 01:25:12,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the next big thing you really need to address

1075
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:16,354
[SPEAKER_09]: is that 10 years is already up relative to the meters that are in the houses.

1076
01:25:16,915 --> 01:25:21,497
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to have to take a second look on those batteries that are in there and just how accurate they are.

1077
01:25:21,837 --> 01:25:26,959
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would suggest that you probably make a resolution to investigate that with the Water and Soil Commissioner.

1078
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:34,963
[SPEAKER_09]: What's their intent going forward as it relates to the accuracy of the batteries that are there, the meters that are there right now that are over 10 years?

1079
01:25:35,323 --> 01:25:42,406
[SPEAKER_09]: And second of all, why can't some money in that multimillion dollar surplus account be used to put that program

1080
01:25:42,974 --> 01:25:44,354
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't even have to have an employee.

1081
01:25:44,374 --> 01:25:47,535
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an automatic program that just spits it out on a daily basis.

1082
01:25:47,915 --> 01:25:55,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone just looks at it, and it's just, you know, as Jeannie Martin just said, you know, why keep hurting the taxpayer rate payer for no reason at all?

1083
01:25:55,617 --> 01:26:00,438
[SPEAKER_09]: These are just simple, common sense, everyday business practices that should be employed.

1084
01:26:01,018 --> 01:26:01,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor.

1085
01:26:01,558 --> 01:26:01,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1086
01:26:02,678 --> 01:26:09,400
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion, as amended by, I think we had it in the paper, by Councilor Marks.

1087
01:26:11,768 --> 01:26:15,689
[SPEAKER_05]: actually report back on the priority of the elites.

1088
01:26:15,809 --> 01:26:23,712
[SPEAKER_05]: The original paper we were going to report back on the report on the administration will let us know in the priority of the elites also.

1089
01:26:24,372 --> 01:26:25,273
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as we get an answer.

1090
01:26:27,293 --> 01:26:27,673
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1091
01:26:27,814 --> 01:26:28,314
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended.

1092
01:26:29,014 --> 01:26:29,614
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended.

1093
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:32,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1094
01:26:33,796 --> 01:26:35,016
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Dello Russo?

1095
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:35,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1096
01:26:35,876 --> 01:26:36,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco?

1097
01:26:36,536 --> 01:26:36,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1098
01:26:37,017 --> 01:26:37,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Nays?

1099
01:26:37,677 --> 01:26:37,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1100
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:39,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor O'Connor?

1101
01:26:40,011 --> 01:26:40,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1102
01:26:40,311 --> 01:26:41,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Mons?

1103
01:26:41,312 --> 01:26:41,552
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1104
01:26:41,732 --> 01:26:42,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1105
01:26:44,714 --> 01:26:45,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Absent.

1106
01:26:45,915 --> 01:26:46,556
[SPEAKER_06]: President Calvillo?

1107
01:26:47,096 --> 01:26:47,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1108
01:26:48,457 --> 01:26:51,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1109
01:26:53,320 --> 01:27:05,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we adjourn on Sunday, January 25th at 10 o'clock at Veterans Memorial Park, we will be dedicating some more, I think about 36 more names will be added to Veterans Memorial Park.

1110
01:27:06,585 --> 01:27:11,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, if everybody could turn out there, it'd be a nice take in.

1111
01:27:11,748 --> 01:27:14,470
[SPEAKER_05]: 10 o'clock on Sunday, Veterans Memorial Park.

1112
01:27:16,191 --> 01:27:24,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Records of the meeting of June 6th, 2017 were tabled and passed to Vice President Marks.

1113
01:27:26,317 --> 01:27:27,557
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1114
01:27:27,597 --> 01:27:30,459
[SPEAKER_05]: Adam, do you want to report on the second meeting?

1115
01:27:30,499 --> 01:27:30,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1116
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:38,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Councilor Knight to report the subcommittee report.

1117
01:27:38,783 --> 01:27:51,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, earlier this afternoon, the subcommittee on zoning and ordinances met to discuss paper, I believe it was 11474, related to wireless telecommunication towers in the city of Medford.

1118
01:27:51,277 --> 01:27:57,523
[SPEAKER_15]: A presentation was put on by the city solicitor and the building commissioner.

1119
01:27:59,286 --> 01:28:05,050
[SPEAKER_15]: Upon conclusion of the presentation, the council moved, uh, the subcommittee moved to, uh, refer the paper to the committee of the whole.

1120
01:28:05,270 --> 01:28:08,692
[SPEAKER_15]: So, uh, the paper is going to go before the committee of the whole for further discussion and deliberation.

1121
01:28:09,133 --> 01:28:18,499
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, it was a rather well thought out and technical ordinance that governed the placement of cell phone towers and wireless telecommunication facilities in the city of Medford.

1122
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1123
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:26,985
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by council on the motion by council night that we accept vice president marks.

1124
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:29,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1125
01:28:29,781 --> 01:28:33,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to thank my council colleague for calling the meeting.

1126
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:48,726
[SPEAKER_04]: This particular ordinance was something that was proposed back in 2011 to address concerns of companies coming into this community and erecting cell towers in residential areas.

1127
01:28:49,486 --> 01:28:53,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the time we put together, I believe it was a seven or eight page ordinance,

1128
01:28:54,278 --> 01:29:05,028
[SPEAKER_04]: that protected neighborhoods in the first place, and secondly, made it difficult for those who wanted to come in here and thought they just had to apply for a building permit and an electrical permit.

1129
01:29:05,728 --> 01:29:20,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think what this ordinance does, Mr. President, it really puts some teeth out there that keeps these particular cell towers to industrial and commercial zone 2 areas and keep them away from neighborhoods.

1130
01:29:21,315 --> 01:29:38,987
[SPEAKER_04]: It also puts a number of restrictions, height restrictions, setback restrictions, and in my opinion, will go a long way to ensuring neighborhoods that all of a sudden, a 74-foot cell tower is not gonna appear in their neighborhood.

1131
01:29:39,548 --> 01:29:47,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we all are aware, and it was recently on the news, I think it was Channel 5, they did a spotlight report on the MBTA.

1132
01:29:47,714 --> 01:29:49,715
[SPEAKER_04]: The MBTA's looking to raise revenue now,

1133
01:29:50,476 --> 01:29:58,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And as part of that, they're also offering riders on their commuter rail the ability to access the Internet.

1134
01:29:59,202 --> 01:30:06,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And in doing so, Mr. President, they have to erect a number of these cell towers along the route of the train.

1135
01:30:07,288 --> 01:30:11,471
[SPEAKER_04]: And the city of Medford, as far as I know, we're getting three now.

1136
01:30:11,491 --> 01:30:14,073
[SPEAKER_04]: It was two, and now there was just a third request.

1137
01:30:14,433 --> 01:30:15,974
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting three, Mr. President.

1138
01:30:16,655 --> 01:30:18,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, the intent

1139
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:25,191
[SPEAKER_04]: is to provide cell communication and internet access, which is great on the train.

1140
01:30:25,231 --> 01:30:26,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not opposed to that.

1141
01:30:26,732 --> 01:30:34,034
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've got to make sure when these cell towers are erected that they're erected in a way that is not a blight to the neighborhood.

1142
01:30:34,775 --> 01:30:45,998
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as I'm concerned, the one near Tyler Ave, or the address of Tyler Ave, isn't a neighborhood, Mr. President, even though it's on train tracks that abut the neighborhood.

1143
01:30:46,418 --> 01:30:47,859
[SPEAKER_04]: And Charnwood Road, again,

1144
01:30:48,222 --> 01:30:50,303
[SPEAKER_04]: in a neighborhood abuts train tracks.

1145
01:30:50,764 --> 01:31:00,850
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one, I believe, is in the Wellington area on Rivers Edge, thank you, which does abut residential areas too, Mr. President.

1146
01:31:01,371 --> 01:31:15,980
[SPEAKER_04]: So this ordinance will go a long way for protecting our neighborhoods, and I look forward to the eventual sending this to the Office of Community Development and for their recommendations.

1147
01:31:16,397 --> 01:31:19,398
[SPEAKER_04]: and then eventual passage, Mr. President, on this ordinance.

1148
01:31:19,878 --> 01:31:22,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor, for taking that out of my ball for us.

1149
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:24,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

1150
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Mr. President.

1151
01:31:26,261 --> 01:31:32,863
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's also very important to point out that although this is an ordinance change, it will have to go through the legislative process, but it's also a zoning change.

1152
01:31:33,344 --> 01:31:38,866
[SPEAKER_15]: So because it's a zoning change, it's going to take about 180 days from start to finish for the paper to come to fruition.

1153
01:31:39,326 --> 01:31:41,907
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to think that people to think this is something we're delaying.

1154
01:31:42,343 --> 01:31:45,106
[SPEAKER_15]: It has to go to the Community Development Board, come back to the council.

1155
01:31:45,146 --> 01:31:48,389
[SPEAKER_15]: There has to be a series of public hearings before we can move on it.

1156
01:31:48,549 --> 01:31:51,471
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why it's good that we're starting the process now.

1157
01:31:52,152 --> 01:31:52,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1158
01:31:53,353 --> 01:31:58,037
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion by Councilor Nunez, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1159
01:31:58,498 --> 01:31:59,219
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1160
01:31:59,239 --> 01:31:59,299

[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1162
01:32:02,021 --> 01:32:08,367
[SPEAKER_05]: The tabled records of the meeting of June 6, 2017 were passed to Vice President Marks

1163
01:32:08,672 --> 01:32:12,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Vice President, were you able to review those records, and how did you find them?

1164
01:32:13,534 --> 01:32:16,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I review the records, find them to be in order.

1165
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:19,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1166
01:32:20,057 --> 01:32:25,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Knight, for the approval of the records.

1167
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:31,482
[SPEAKER_05]: The records of the meeting of June 13th, 2017, were passed to Councilor Scarpelli.

1168
01:32:33,883 --> 01:32:36,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli, how did you find those records?

1169
01:32:36,946 --> 01:32:38,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the records in order.

1170
01:32:38,648 --> 01:32:40,550
[SPEAKER_02]: I motion to move and place on file.
