    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=28.971s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=29.811s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=41.04s">indivisible,</a>  with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=45.342s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions, 17-533, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the city administration establish an action plan to address the Canadian geese problem in our public parks and report back to the council the proposed course of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=64.508s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=66.029s">Mr.</a>  President, I think this is a rather self-explanatory resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=70.088s">Ultimately,</a>  I went to the park over the weekend with my kids, and my kid picked up some Canadian goose poop, which grossed me out to no end. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=77.631s">So</a>  I've been talking with some individuals in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=80.552s">I</a>  talked with the director of the parks department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=82.773s">It's</a>  a problem that's prevalent in a number of our parks in the community, and I'm hoping that the administration can provide us with an action plan as to how to address it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=89.836s">We</a>  only have a very small window where we can utilize our public parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=93.057s">It's</a>  finally stopped raining, and we finally had some nice weather out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=96.258s">So</a>  it's my intent that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=98.02s">opportunity</a>  to quietly enjoy our public parks free from goose droppings.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=102.841s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=104.422s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=112.024s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=115.145s">17-534,</a>  offered by Councilor Lango-Kern, be it resolved that the Medford City Council get an update on who has been appointed to the Cable Advisory Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=127.68s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=129.322s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=131.364s">I</a>  did receive a couple people who were interested in the new TV3 station and had questions with regards to the Cable Advisory Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=138.831s">It</a>  was the first I was aware that a committee has been established. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=143.455s">I'm</a>  obviously out of the loop, so I was just wondering if we could get a copy of how many people are on the advisory committee and who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=151.814s">as</a>  well as have they met yet and if there are any minutes, I'd like to just amend this, if there's been any minutes, if we could get a copy of those minutes so we can better see what's been transpiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=162.898s">I</a>  think it's great we have the station up and running to a point and just want to keep an idea of what's happening so we're able to answer people's questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=174.183s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=175.622s">Councilor</a>  Lococo, if I could amend that to ask if we're doing interviews for a manager for the station also?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=183.364s">Yes,</a>  yes please. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=184.385s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=185.705s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lococo, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo, as amended by President Caraviello, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=193.547s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=194.448s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=198.449s">17-535</a>  offered by Councilor Lococo, be it resolved that the Medford City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=203.667s">to</a>  be provided a breakdown from the school department of the number of school transfers from one Medford public school to another, request in 2015, 16, 17, and the number of transfers allowed by each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=219.079s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the numbers be broken down by school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=223.182s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=224.441s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=224.821s">President</a>  Caraviello, I believe within the next couple nights we're meeting with the superintendent of schools to go over. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=230.486s">We</a>  don't have it yet, but hopefully we'll get it sooner than later, the budget for the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=236.291s">I</a>  was recently asked how many transfers there are from one school to another by a resident, and I have had no idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=243.097s">So</a>  I said I will put this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=244.459s">I'd</a>  be curious to see how many transfer requests are out there and how many are allowed per each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=252.24s">I</a>  know there's a discrepancy with the amount of children that are in each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=255.723s">So</a>  I just want to see, and there was an issue with class size for one of the grades at the Roberts that was discussed last night at the school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=266.47s">So</a>  I just want to see how it is all broken down over the last three years so we can get a better idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=271.494s">When</a>  we look at the numbers, we can kind of have the big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=275.336s">And</a>  we also want to be able to answer people's questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=278.174s">I</a>  know a lot of people do request, I don't know if it's a lot, but people do request transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=283.038s">So</a>  it's just something that we've never asked and we've never got an answer to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=287.362s">So</a>  I think it's be relevant to get these answers before we meet with the superintendent or at least before we vote on the budget potentially next Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=297.511s">So</a>  if I could move approval with a roll call vote.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=300.614s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=301.635s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=303.176s">Second,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=304.875s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Legon-Kern and seconded by Councilor Dello Russo, a roll call vote has been requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=311.617s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=329.048s">Yes,</a>  seven in the affirmative, none in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=332.491s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=334.993s">17-536,</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=338.636s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council be provided a list from the school department of all increased and decreased class sizes within our Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=348.045s">For</a>  example, if a class is adding a class due to class size issues or vice versa. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=354.27s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=355.831s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=357.031s">President</a>  Caraviello, I put this on last week, I believe it was Wednesday, Thursday, I started getting phone calls with regards to the concern of class sizes, mainly at one school and one grade, and I put this on because there's talk of, every year I'm assuming, depending on the numbers, there may be one or two or three, I don't know how many, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=382.668s">where</a>  a teacher is pulled from a grade to accommodate another grade and I wanted to see how many of those we have this coming year so we can obviously get control of it and make sure all our class sizes allow. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=395.09s">I</a>  believe after last night's meeting we were guaranteed that all class sizes would be under 22 and I believe the class average is about 20 students per classroom so I just want to make sure we <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=409.724s">maintain</a>  that level and we make sure that we're gonna provide those little class sizes to everybody, every student across the board.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=417.91s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=418.45s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=423.554s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=424.375s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=427.717s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=430.699s">17-537,</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the Medford City Council be provided <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=437.873s">with</a>  a list from the school department of all new hires and newly created positions within the fiscal year 2018 budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=446.996s">Be</a>  it further resolved that we also receive a list of all positions that have been eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=452.978s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=454.238s">Thank</a>  you again, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=457.279s">Each</a>  year we are left with the large school budget and to look and see, try to figure out who's been added, who's been taken out of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=467.025s">Each</a>  year we have sometimes a position or two or three that has been created, which obviously is something that I think needs to be in bold print, if not obviously given to us separately so we can understand what is going on in the school system and be able to vote on the budget accordingly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=485.654s">So</a>  I asked for a list of all those new hires and newly created positions as well as all the positions that are being eliminated so we can do our job.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=550.97s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=553.132s">First,</a>  I'd like to, I received a letter from Superintendent of WIRES, Steven Randazzo, and this is a recent happening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=565.98s">The</a>  letter is dated June 5th, 2017, and it's from Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=571.583s">As</a>  we all know, National Grid, for many years in this community, was the custodian of all the telephone poles, or I should say, a good majority of the telephone poles in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=582.757s">And</a>  just recently, Verizon and National Grid reached an agreement on who the custodian of the poles are, and I think this is pertinent information for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=593.343s">So</a>  I'd like to read just a portion, Mr. President, as I stated dated June 5th, 2017 from Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=600.447s">This</a>  is dear municipal official, this is to inform you that effective May 31st, 2017, National Grid and Verizon have reached an agreement that changes the way the two companies perform <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=612.923s">utility</a>  pole work in your community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=615.765s">The</a>  agreement updates operating procedures in place for more than 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=619.967s">Under</a>  the new agreement, custodial areas where one or more other pole owner had assumed responsibility for replacing and installing new utility poles on a municipal basis have been eliminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=633.875s">Instead,</a>  National Grid will be responsible for all replacements, relocations, and new installations of jointly owned poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=641.996s">Verizon</a>  will be responsible for removing all jointly owned poles once the replacement pole is installed and all facility transfers are completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=651.98s">So</a>  right now, Mr. President, according to this letter, Verizon will now be responsible for the removal of all double poles, which is brand new to this community and I think one that people should be aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=668.847s">I</a>  offer this resolution tonight, Mr. President, to address the lack of attention with utility companies to the number of double poles we have in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=679.816s">According</a>  to our Superintendent Owais, we have a little over 8,400 telephone poles within the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=689.192s">And</a>  according to the latest list I just received, there are roughly 245 double poles in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=698.959s">So</a>  if you look at it as a street situation, almost one out of every three streets in our community has a double pole on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=708.49s">Right</a>  now, the current list is Verizon has 88 poles that they're responsible for removing wires, and that's why the pole is still up, the double pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=719.913s">National</a>  Grid has 51 poles they're responsible for, and Comcast has 101 poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=727.795s">The</a>  city of Medford, Mr. President, and I'm proud to report this, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=732.757s">back</a>  several years ago, was on close to, I believe it was 90 to 100 poles, that we had fire call boxes that were still hooked up, and they were holding the utility companies from removing the double pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=746.367s">To</a>  date, Mr. President, we have one double pole on the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=752.512s">And</a>  that is a huge accomplishment, and the Superintendent of Wires, Steven Randazzo, should be commended on his work <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=762.377s">Mr.</a>  President, for putting together a priority list and getting our city utility, which is the fire call box, off the poles, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=771.92s">But</a>  double poles, as we know, are a blight to our community and a public safety concern to area residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=778.583s">Utility</a>  companies are unresponsive and have no incentive to remove double poles in a reasonable time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=785.484s">The</a>  current system for moving polls is dysfunctional and the state law ineffective. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=791.609s">Municipalities</a>  need a new approach that hold utility companies accountable, requiring better coordination and improved communication to resolve this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=803.58s">As</a>  we all know, Chapter 164, Section 34B forbids companies from keeping double poles up for more than 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=812.546s">However,</a>  there is no penalty to the utility company for not complying with the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=818.27s">On</a>  July 28, 2005, the Mass Supreme Court Judicial Court upheld a lower court ruling <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=825.088s">overturning</a>  a Bedford Mass bylaw, imposing a $100 a day fine for each set of double utility poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=833.153s">The</a>  court ruled that only the state legislature has the authority to impose a fine for keeping double poles. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=840.218s">So</a>  based on that decision back in 2005, Mr. President, I offered a council resolution on October 3rd <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=849.711s">2006,</a>  requesting our state delegation amend chapter 164, section 34B, allowing city or town to the ability to enact local ordinances or bylaws prohibiting double polls beyond the 90 days, punishable by a fine not to exceed a maximum of $100 per occurrence per day. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=873.882s">Rep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=874.523s">Scortino</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=875.912s">Then</a>  on October 6, 2006, based on the council resolution, offered a sponsor to build, Mr. President, with that exact terminology, which would allow, it was House Bill 1675, which would allow local cities and towns to actually find these utility companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=898.258s">And</a>  it got bantered around in the State House, and <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=904.622s">What</a>  ultimately ended up happening, from what I understand, is that the utility companies were upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=916.229s">Let's</a>  see where, let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=921.012s">The</a>  utility companies, Mr. President, were upset because they said it was unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=927.163s">to</a>  find the custodian of the pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=929.885s">For</a>  instance, at the time, if National Grid owned the pole, they also had Comcast, Verizon on the pole, and they may be the ones holding up the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=939.85s">So</a>  they said, how can you find us as the custodian where these other utilities are holding up the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=946.638s">And</a>  in my opinion, Mr. President, the responsibility of the utility company that's the pole owner, they have license agreements with all these other attachees that are on the pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=961.09s">And</a>  their license agreement states that they have the authority to transfer wires <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=966.998s">at</a>  the attachee's expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=968.859s">So</a>  if National Grid thought Comcast was taking too long removing their wires, under their license agreement, they can go in at the attachee's expense and remove the wires, and we can get rid of the double pole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=981.047s">So</a>  you can see how the ambiguity that's out there really lends itself to a process that is not functioning, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=989.655s">And</a>  this has been an issue, as you can see, it dates back to 2006 and far beyond that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=995.756s">So</a>  what I want to offer tonight, Mr. President, with the hopes of getting approval from this council, is that the state create, and this would be the Department of Telecommunications, they create, Mr. President, a statewide database <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1017.471s">which</a>  they oversee and they enforce. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1021.293s">Right</a>  now, there's a database called Poll Lifetime Management System, and all the utility companies, it's PLM, all the utility companies and many municipalities have access to this system, so they can go online and look at these reports, which I have a copy in front of me, that states who's on the poll, how long the poll's been there, and who's responsible for taking their wires off. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1045.947s">And</a>  they have access to this system, but there's no oversight by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1050.969s">So</a>  my request tonight through a motion of this council is that we request our state delegation to file legislation creating the statewide enforcement and penalty structure under the oversight and responsibility of the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1067.114s">Department</a>  of Public Utilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1069.435s">And</a>  by doing so, Mr. President, we'll create a state entity that's responsible for the oversight <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1075.814s">and</a>  also serve as an online tracking process that allows review of the state and possible finding by the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1086.717s">So</a>  the municipalities don't have to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1089.098s">It's</a>  the utility, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1090.818s">Department</a>  of Public Utilities, which currently right now is the oversight for utilities in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1096.86s">They</a>  should step up to the plate and take responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1100.695s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation tonight, Mr. President, that our state delegation file legislation to allow enforcement by Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1108.741s">Department</a>  of Public Utilities and also the ability to find, Mr. President, by Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1113.405s">Department</a>  of Public Utilities so we can once and for all put this issue in the rearview mirror and not have to reinvent this issue every year after year when the utility companies are just ignoring our request <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1128.975s">to</a>  remove double poles, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1131.456s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1199.509s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1200.93s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1202.111s">I'd</a>  like to kindly request the council to consider the implementation of an ordinance to require property owners to maintain their property at a minimum standard of care and cleanliness. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1214.422s">Some</a>  cities have such an ordinance in place, but Medford does not. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1218.645s">The</a>  majority of residents do maintain their property in good condition, but the few who do not cause a significant impact to their neighbors and to those who pass by these properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1228.631s">For</a>  example, one, this potential fire hazard for uncut grass that grows to excessive heights that can become a fire hazard in the summertime. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1239.776s">Two,</a>  the attraction of unwanted animals and pests. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1242.458s">For</a>  example, rotted wood on structures of a property or lying on their property that can attract termites and easily spread to neighboring homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1251.844s">The</a>  attraction of rats, mice that can cause infestation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1256.907s">Three,</a>  the deterrence of prospective buyers who want to purchase or invest in a property that is in close proximity to a neglected property. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1268.73s">The</a>  depreciation value of a property that is in the vicinity of a neglected or deplorable property. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1275.732s">One</a>  could argue from a legal standpoint that a negligent property owner could be liable for damages because their negligence causes the loss of value to another property owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1288.487s">Lastly,</a>  it's simply unsightly, inoffensive to see a neglected property in our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1294.992s">And</a>  allowing property to be kept in deplorable conditions goes against the efforts of the city to maintain a sense of pride and decency in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1305.0s">The</a>  city has ordinances in place for dog owners, dog waste, property owners to keep their sidewalks clear of debris and snow, public littering, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1315.011s">Not</a>  having an ordinance in place to address negligent property owners hurts the majority of residents by allowing so-called slum property owners to embarrass our city, cause a depreciation of surrounding property value, and increase safety risks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1331.923s">Additionally,</a>  without an ordinance in place, the City and its residents are helpless to address this issue, leaving individual residents to try and resolve matters on their own, which could result in bad situations amongst neighbors that could lead to civil unrest and violence. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1349.477s">We</a>  shouldn't have to wait until a bad situation occurs before recognizing the need for a common sense ordinance to ensure Medford can be proud of its city and its surroundings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1363.608s">I</a>  would like to share a copy of an ordinance from another city regarding the cleanliness expectations from its residents and property owners that I'm happy to leave as a reference for consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1377.239s">And</a>  thank you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1385.64s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1425.681s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1426.061s">Yes,</a>  I have. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1428.462s">First</a>  off, for years, I lived next to a property like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1434.025s">And</a>  for years, I lived next to a property in that <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1439.008s">in</a>  deplorable conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1441.149s">Both</a>  myself and many of my residents, the neighbors on my street, have tried for years to reach out to the city to have this addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1450.255s">I</a>  personally, myself, over the past year have spoken to the building department, the health department, the police, the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1456.679s">Every</a>  department that everyone has referred me to, I have contacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1460.681s">And</a>  I have been told that there is nothing they can do about it unless <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1467.825s">It's</a>  a safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1468.725s">There</a>  was limitations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1470.026s">And</a>  it brought me to this particular point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1472.447s">There</a>  is no ordinance in the city that allows the city to address this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1478.909s">If</a>  there was an ordinance, the city and the police can go there and say, hey, this is an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1482.77s">You</a>  need to take care of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1483.991s">This</a>  is unacceptable, whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1485.211s">The</a>  conditions as stated forth in an ordinance sort of allows the authorities of the city to enforce it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1491.378s">and</a>  or potentially fine property owners if they don't keep them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1495.639s">Again,</a>  I'm only asking a minimal standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1497.54s">I</a>  mean, I'm not saying they have to keep it as a palace, but there are certain minimal expectations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1501.641s">I</a>  feel that everybody should respect for your community and for your neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1509.584s">I'm</a>  not sure I answered all your questions.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1512.065s">You</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1512.505s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1586.303s">And</a>  to me, that would be ideal for the clean it or lean it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1589.605s">That</a>  would be ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1591.006s">So</a>  I think we could remedy, I don't know if you want to give an address, but we can recommend through this council that the Board of Health as well as code enforcement go out to the property <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1602.69s">and</a>  do a site view.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1604.611s">I</a>  did go to the building department last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1607.972s">And</a>  I explained it, and they told me there was only limited resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1614.133s">They</a>  were limited to what they could do based on the cleaner or leaner that you were referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1623.356s">They</a>  did mention that they were going to go there and try and talk to the owner about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1630.118s">I</a>  haven't heard back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1633.0s">I'm</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1634.082s">One</a>  of the information's Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1639.169s">Is</a>  it, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1639.93s">Cause</a>  we, I'm sorry to interrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1641.412s">I</a>  just, I just, I wasn't know if it was someone just put, but a porta potty, I think that a building department should know through the permitting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1649.204s">Correct?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1649.94s">The</a>  board of health.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1650.62s">It's</a>  probably not a, it's not a legal one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1652.801s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1653.021s">It's</a>  just, I know, but if it's there too long.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1655.401s">Oh</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1655.781s">Oh</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1656.041s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1656.521s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1656.782s">If</a>  I may, I mean there are, there are many issues in this particular property and, and I, um, I'm for sure there are other properties throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1665.704s">The</a>  bottom line is it's just like, there should be a minimal expect, you know, expectations of property owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1671.445s">For</a>  example, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1672.305s">what</a>  about the, you know, there is no ordinance for currently or anything on the books about grass. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1677.527s">When</a>  you have a drought, like a situation we had last year where it didn't rain all summer and you have grass that's, you know, like four feet high. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1684.671s">I</a>  mean, that's a fire hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1685.991s">There</a>  should be some kind of ordinance and expectation there.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1689.073s">I</a>  mean, it applies to all that, just so you know that it applies to grass that's unkept. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1694.675s">It</a>  applies to putting items on your lawn or in your yard.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1697.956s">I</a>  was told by the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1699.116s">I</a>  don't mean to interrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1699.756s">I</a>  was told by the building last week that that was not applicable to the situation.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1707.639s">I</a>  think you've got bogus information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1712.22s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1712.44s">And</a>  I know it's applied in other circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1715.321s">I</a>  don't want to give out where the property was. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1717.301s">But</a>  that clean and lean, and it was regarding tall bushes, regarding tall grass that was unkept.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1723.834s">I</a>  spoke to two people, one in person, one on the phone, gave them the property address. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1729.462s">They</a>  said they were going to go out and speak to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1732.487s">Again,</a>  I was told that they were limited to what they were able to do to enforce it or force <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1739.819s">you</a>  know, the property owner to do anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1742.362s">And</a>  again, I've been after this for years and more recently last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1746.687s">So</a>  I have yet to see any results. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1749.17s">Uh,</a>  I haven't heard anybody back from the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1753.014s">And</a>  again, if there's an ordinance, if that is applicable, then, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1758.128s">Is</a>  that a written document? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1760.55s">It's</a>  a city ordinance.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1761.912s">It's</a>  a city ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1762.632s">I</a>  don't have the site section, but it's a city ordinance.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1765.215s">And</a>  that pertains to everything that I'm describing?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1769.179s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1770.14s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1770.56s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1770.84s">So</a>  they can use that to enforce the property owner to make their property <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1782.258s">comply</a>  to a certain standard.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1783.899s">Clean</a>  it or lean it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1784.679s">Clean</a>  it, meaning clean it up or lean it.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1786.659s">So</a>  I'm very confused because, again, I've been to every department in the city for the past year and a half or two years, and I have... Well, if you're that confused, grab a seat and you can come back here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1797.201s">We</a>  have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1799.482s">So</a>  if I could get a copy of that ordinance at some point, and if maybe the building department can follow up on this, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1810.435s">I</a>  think I can get some answers to know what the next step is.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1815.137s">Give</a>  us an address. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1816.098s">Do</a>  you have an address? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1816.958s">We</a>  need an address.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1818.319s">Yeah,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Lisa Defabritiis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1821.561s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1823.082s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1826.563s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1826.904s">I</a>  look at addresses all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1829.205s">Councilor</a>  Lococoon.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1831.246s">I</a>  was going to mention the Clean It and Lean It ordinance, too, and I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1835.689s">If</a>  we get the proper department, you know, the person in the building department, we can try to get somebody out there for a site visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1842.054s">So</a>  I think the best way to do that is for her to email us all and we can, you know, obviously help work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1848.839s">But</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1849.379s">I</a>  think there's a lot of properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1851.121s">I</a>  was contacting the building department last week on a property on Doonan Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1855.744s">It's</a>  been under construction for about two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1859.026s">There's</a>  no stairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1860.127s">There's</a>  rocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1860.868s">And</a>  I mean, grass couldn't even grow because there's rocks everywhere and I'm getting complaints on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1865.555s">So</a>  it is hard for the building departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1868.076s">Sometimes</a>  their hands are tied. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1871.797s">But</a>  for something like this, it seems like our Board of Health and our building department should be able to do a site visit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1878.639s">And</a>  if there's no permit on that porta potty that's in somebody's driveway, something should be done.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1884.361s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1885.462s">Councilor</a>  Nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1886.923s">Mr.</a>  President, I have had great luck with the Board of Health and the Code Enforcement Office in getting some of these issues rectified as well, so I really think it might be that we need to point an individual in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1897.706s">With</a>  that being said, though, the lady was kind enough to pass out a copy of an ordinance that I'm hoping we can all get copies of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1904.588s">At</a>  this point in time, I'd ask that the paper be received and placed on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1907.249s">We</a>  have an opportunity to take a look at the draft ordinance that's in place, and we can contrast that with our <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1912.457s">existing</a>  rules and regulations that are established by the Board of Health and the Building Commission, and then we can determine whether or not we need to move forward with a minimum standard of cleanliness ordinance, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1920.723s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1921.544s">Larry,</a>  if you can make us copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1926.367s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1929.469s">Gene</a>  Nuzzo, 35 Parrish Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1933.472s">I</a>  think on the face, when you look at these properties that are distressed, they're a symptom to a larger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1940.617s">And</a>  although I appreciate <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1942.158s">with</a>  a clean it or lean it approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1945.839s">It's</a>  not just residents that we have a problem with. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1948.639s">It's</a>  also businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1950.419s">So</a>  my position is a lot of these instances, when you delve a little deeper, you're dealing with people who are barely hanging on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1960.161s">They're</a>  the folks working two jobs who don't have time to mow the lawn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1964.382s">They're</a>  being deaf by paper cuts in fees and expenses from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1972.083s">I</a>  really think it's a very slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1974.644s">And</a>  if we're going to start to really look at enforcing a clean it or lean it, then it should also be applied, perhaps more heavy-handedly, to the property owners who allow their commercial properties to remain empty and an eyesore on the city for a tax write-off in their real estate portfolio. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=1995.692s">Certainly,</a>  those people can afford it far more than some individual who may be <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2000.477s">as</a>  having trouble keeping their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2003.319s">So</a>  I would urge you, as you start to look at this ordinance and delve into it deeper, to consider that some of these folks, it's an issue of finance and time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2014.926s">And</a>  this is another one of those methods and approaches that can often lead to gentrification. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2023.891s">And</a>  I think it's no secret how I feel about balancing our development <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2030.508s">in</a>  our image with not gentrifying our residents out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2034.41s">So</a>  I would just ask you to consider those things as you look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2037.352s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2039.253s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2039.793s">Nugent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2042.355s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight that we review and place on file, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2050.539s">The</a>  messenger is doing that as we speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2058.023s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2059.823s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2063.946s">Motion</a>  by Vice President Marks to move suspension of the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2072.011s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2076.034s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2077.415s">My</a>  name is Robert Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2083.159s">I</a>  come here tonight on two very important issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2088.197s">that</a>  directly affect this Medford City Council and the taxpayers of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2093.059s">The</a>  first one is to address the issue of the CPA, the Community Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2098.18s">As</a>  we know, when it was passed in November of 2015, it has a lifespan of five years from the date of its passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2105.062s">It's</a>  now going to be just about into its second year with three years to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2109.064s">The</a>  unfortunate part about this CPA is that at an election night some two years ago, almost 1,200 to 1,300 ballots <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2117.307s">were</a>  never acted upon because a lot of people never turned the ballot over to vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2121.409s">So</a>  whether it was going to pass or not, nobody even knew. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2124.951s">Apparently,</a>  it did pass from those members that did vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2128.172s">The</a>  unfortunate part about this particular act, and I'm going to draw the correlation to the connectivity fee, it's another tax being opposed upon the taxpayers of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2138.238s">But</a>  unfortunately, they're not getting that for which they voted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2143.04s">The</a>  Enabling Act, which goes back to 2001 and 2002, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2147.789s">addressed</a>  itself through the years, right up until this past year, to the fact that whatever and however the population count takes place, and however the tax valuation on assessed pieces of property here in the city of Medford, as in all cities and towns, determines the dollar amount that will come back from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2166.419s">Now,</a>  we all know that for the past years, the Commonwealth has been having a tough time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2171.862s">So</a>  let's just go back to fiscal year 2013, the state gave back <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2177.44s">52</a>  percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2178.341s">Fiscal</a>  year 2014, 31 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2181.764s">Fiscal</a>  year 2015, 29.7 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2186.347s">And</a>  this present past fiscal year 2016, they were at 18 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2191.812s">So</a>  for every dollar that every taxpayer here in the city of Medford has given up as it relates to their assessed evaluation at the 1.5 percent, the state will give back approximately 18 percent, which is nowhere near the dollar for dollar of 100 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2207.22s">I've</a>  spoken to members up at the legislature and I've spoken to other cities and towns where they feel to some degree that the taxpayer is not getting their real bang for the buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2216.842s">You</a>  guys and gals are into this thing on the second year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2219.742s">You</a>  still have no program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2221.363s">There's</a>  still no designation where and how that money can be spent, whether it's for housing, affordable housing, parks and recreation, or historical values. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2232.625s">Those</a>  are the three primary things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2235.269s">at</a>  a minimum of each one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2237.51s">So</a>  what I did is I looked at the law and I found it on page, it's section 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2243.773s">Larry,</a>  he's not here when he comes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2247.095s">And</a>  I think what I would want to do, and I'll pass one off for each of you, the intent of what I'd like to have is to have you as a city council consider the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2255.139s">Since</a>  in fact the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not paying back dollar for dollar as people <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2260.511s">have</a>  been led to believe because of the 158 cities and towns that now make up the CPA throughout the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2267.658s">I</a>  don't think it's fair that we should keep paying, having our taxpayers pay their 1.5 share for the purposes of hopefully thinking they're going to get a match back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2278.609s">The</a>  proposal that I'm asking you as a council to do is to file a piece of legislation to amend <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2285.04s">Section</a>  18, A and B. And in those two sections, they basically will say, if in fact the Commonwealth cannot meet its obligation of dollar for dollar for which the city of Medford at 1.5 is taxing their residents, then the city can suspend, by a vote of the city council, suspend any further collection of those taxes or that 1.5%, or you could also vote to reduce it down to 1%, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2313.327s">until</a>  further notice, until the Commonwealth meets its obligation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2316.909s">That's</a>  the first part. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2318.27s">And</a>  the second part, and I think it's very important that it's understood, that if this city and this council wants to not renew the CPA after its fifth year, at present, the only way you can do it is it becomes automatically taking place unless the city council, by a vote, puts the question on the ballot and the people vote for it all over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2342.007s">My</a>  amendment to that portion states basically this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2345.028s">At</a>  the end of the fifth year, it automatically dies. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2348.389s">If,</a>  in fact, the people of this community and whoever the council might be at that time wishes to go forward and renew it again for another five years, then the question goes on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2359.073s">You</a>  are dealing with right now your second fiscal year on this CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2363.635s">I</a>  don't think any one of you behind this rail have even been informed as to where and how that money is going to be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2368.835s">And</a>  there are provisos in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2370.977s">It's</a>  a 12-page document. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2372.559s">There</a>  are 18 sections that go with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2374.541s">And</a>  in those 18 sections, it's very important to understand and to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2377.944s">There's</a>  a great latitude that up to a nine-member board or a commission has with that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2383.83s">And</a>  you as a council haven't even been right into the picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2386.632s">No</a>  public meetings and hearings have been held to find out where and how that money can be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2391.154s">While</a>  30% can go to housing, historical, and open space and recreational, the remaining 70% can be likewise used for the same if not similar situations that CPA will approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2404.079s">I</a>  think you folks really need to take a deep hard look at this particular law because as of July 4th, as I said, once people start getting hit with a connectivity fee every other month and then begin to realize that their 1.5%, which is in excess of a million dollars, is being collected here at City Hall, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2420.382s">And</a>  the state is not giving back the dollar for dollar, as people thought they did when they voted for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2425.685s">That's</a>  two unfair taxes being placed upon taxpayers at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2431.449s">The</a>  second thing I would like to talk about is the money that, on October 7, 2014, after many weeks of failure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2444.798s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2446.098s">On</a>  October 7, 2014, I don't know what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2453.547s">on</a>  October 7th, 2014, after the then Medford City Council was reviewing Park Medford's application before the city of Medford, and Mayor McGlynn, at that point in time, signed the contract on October 7th, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2472.572s">Five</a>  additional addendums were included into that Park Medford contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2479.133s">And</a>  the one that stands out is the following, it says, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2481.942s">He's</a>  recommending $250,000 of the revenue generated on a yearly basis to be dedicated to business district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2490.889s">Now</a>  that's a result of the mayor making the comment after deliberating and discussing concerns issued by many business people in the community, the mayor is recommending the following. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2502.359s">And</a>  he did that the same day he made that announcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2507.543s">On</a>  December 18th, 2015, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2510.643s">The</a>  Mayor sent out a notice to the members of the City Council, which basically said, in part, a representative of each business district will recommend to the Mayor some proposed uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2525.028s">I</a>  respectfully request and recommend that the sum of $250,000 be transferred <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2530.673s">from</a>  the sale of real estate to be used for improvements to the five business districts with kiosks as I recommended earlier this year, which would have been effective calendar year 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2543.277s">Now,</a>  we go a little bit further. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2544.738s">We</a>  go to December 23, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2549.759s">Once</a>  again, in the press release issued by the local press from the mayor's office, it states $250,000 annually would be subject to appropriation <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2558.402s">for</a>  district improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2560.083s">And</a>  as a result of that, that came from then the mayor's secretary, Lisa Evangelista, and she was given that by then budget director, Stephanie Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2571.071s">And</a>  then lastly, we have on January 24th of 2016, once again, after a signing ceremony of a 10-year contract for the program, Mayor McGlynn said $250,000 of the city's annual revenue <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2585.706s">would</a>  be used for improvements to business districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2589.207s">This</a>  is the catch. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2590.667s">The</a>  prior mayor made a commitment to that, Burke said. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2594.248s">When</a>  we initially rolled it out, my interpretation was that that would be about and beyond the fixed amount that we collected. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2601.97s">Now,</a>  how could that be about and beyond when the mayor specifically said it would come out of your real estate account? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2609.092s">Each</a>  district right now is $100,000 behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2612.571s">and</a>  what they should have been getting for the past two years, inclusive of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2617.395s">I</a>  believe as council members, you have a deep responsibility right now to get answers from this mayor as it relates to not only the $50,000 for each square, where is the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2629.065s">Because</a>  that money should be designated in the real estate account. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2633.068s">It's</a>  unfair to the business districts in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2635.977s">This</a>  is an election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2636.957s">You're</a>  going to see a lot of puffing going along. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2638.998s">Well,</a>  we're going to do this, and we're going to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2641.199s">Well,</a>  I don't think any of these districts have seen anything going on right now that makes them a lot better than they were when they first started when Park Medford came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2648.963s">You're</a>  talking about $500,000 that should be accounted for right now that should come out of that account sale of real estate for which the mayor indicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2658.578s">You</a>  folks have not received one document from this administration telling you that that money would not be forthcoming from that account. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2669.769s">I</a>  just think it's unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2671.511s">I</a>  think it's unfair to the taxpayers, the business people in this community, the Chamber of Commerce, who are all led to believe that that money would be forthcoming and to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2680.38s">Mr.</a>  President, I would like to <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2683.347s">ask</a>  that someone on the council, maybe all the council members, ask the mayor, where is the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2689.129s">When</a>  is it going to be forthcoming to the business districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2691.99s">And</a>  how can we see it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2693.851s">So</a>  the people of this community will have an understanding that this city keeps its word. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2699.133s">It's</a>  just not political puffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2703.894s">I'd</a>  like to pass out the site and sections of the law, which we just talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2710.236s">Could</a>  you give one to each one, including the clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2712.252s">I'd</a>  like to have you look at it, and in the July meeting, I'd like to come back and see what your thoughts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2717.916s">You</a>  know, ratepayers in this community are paying an awful lot, not only for their taxes, in their water bills, their sewer bills, now a connectivity fee, you know, and now we're looking at a CPA tax, that all intentions were good, and I think a lot of people would say if we were getting the 100% back from the Commonwealth, we'd be in good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2738.511s">But</a>  if it's only progressed for 18% of this year, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2742.231s">It's</a>  just unfair to keep it in the Medford tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2744.694s">Whether</a>  it's $50, $60, $70, $80 a year, that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2748.218s">It's</a>  another tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2749.579s">Another</a>  tax that cannot be accounted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2751.762s">And</a>  this one comes from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2754.385s">So</a>  this would probably be easier for you folks to even deal with because it's not even coming from the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2759.37s">I'd</a>  be more than happy to answer any questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2761.662s">But</a>  I just think, you know, when you start looking at these things, it's election year, and walking the streets and talking to people all day long, this is what I hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2769.066s">Why</a>  are we paying for these things? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2770.967s">Why</a>  are we paying for a connectivity fee when we have $850,000 in a water and sewer surplus account? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2776.87s">Why</a>  are we paying for a CPA tax when we're not even getting 100% reimbursement? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2782.353s">And</a>  it just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2784.014s">And</a>  then you go into the business districts, they're just completely fed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2787.335s">They</a>  just can't understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2788.82s">what's</a>  going on in this building here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2790.501s">There's</a>  absolutely no communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2792.081s">There's</a>  no transparency as to how and what money is to be spent around here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2797.403s">I'd</a>  be more than happy to answer any question if anybody has it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2801.945s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2803.166s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2804.386s">To</a>  the gentleman at the podium, I do believe, and refresh my memory, because I know you've got a lot of good notes there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2810.128s">At</a>  one point in time, the previous administration did put forward a paper for the council to appropriate $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2814.67s">Isn't</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2815.19s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2819.56s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2820.18s">And</a>  do you know when that happened?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2821.861s">December,</a>  the first time it came about after the discussions, like I said, it was October 7th, 2014.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2827.842s">October</a>  2014.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2829.563s">That's</a>  when the contract was signed.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2830.883s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2831.143s">And</a>  then the paper was introduced to the council floor, I believe.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2835.305s">I</a>  believe it was presented before the council floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2837.585s">A</a>  representative from the mayor's office was here on that particular night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2840.726s">I</a>  believe it was in the following January and I believe on January 28th of the following year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2847.572s">the</a>  full-blown discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2848.752s">Even</a>  maybe Mr. Nash was here the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2850.193s">I</a>  could be wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2850.913s">Don't</a>  hold me to it, but we've had so many of those meetings.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2853.774s">So</a>  there was a request made of the council to incorporate $250,000 to the building districts, but the previous council didn't act on it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2860.757s">The</a>  administration absolutely said it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2862.597s">That</a>  money was going to be earmarked on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2865.328s">from</a>  the sale of real estate to the five business districts.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2868.43s">Folks,</a>  the previous administration did send us a paper requesting appropriation.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2871.191s">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2871.351s">And</a>  we got that, as a matter of fact.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2872.232s">And</a>  then that money was never appropriated because the council failed to act, correct?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2874.994s">You</a>  never got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2875.594s">You</a>  never got the request to have it appropriated.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2878.155s">See,</a>  I'm remembering that we got a paper requesting the $250,000 be appropriated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2882.498s">That's</a>  why I ask, because my recollection is a little bit different than that that was presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2888.141s">But</a>  with that being said, I rest, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2890.43s">But</a>  you have, Mr. President, approximately $500,000 that needs to be accounted for for the years 2016 and coming into 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2897.075s">It's</a>  a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2898.677s">And</a>  where is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2899.357s">And</a>  why is it back into the business districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2902.099s">That's</a>  one of the reasons why Mayor McGlynn back then decided to amend it by adding those five additional things into the contract on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2909.906s">This</a>  was going to be out of the sale of real estate, not something over and beyond that for which Park Medford was paying us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2918.403s">as</a>  the former budget director, now present mayor, has indicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2922.626s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2923.887s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2925.328s">I</a>  thank prior Councilor Penter for coming forward and refreshing our memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2932.793s">I</a>  believe that, I agree with you, if it should come out of anywhere, it should be the sale of real estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2937.997s">And</a>  I'm sure you're aware, the latest we've heard is that we are going to be asked to vote out of it, take the money out of free cash at some point <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2947.577s">in</a>  the near future to give $50,000 to each business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2951.598s">So</a>  I, too, I mean, I feel that it should come out of the budget rather than free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2955.279s">But</a>  that's the way, that's what's playing out now.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2958.559s">Part</a>  of that argument, so to speak, back then that was present is it would be on an annual basis that the squares, a representative or representatives from each one of the squares would meet on an annual basis for the purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2970.802s">Now,</a>  let's just say if they were into their second year, which would be up to $100,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2975.707s">This</a>  could be an ongoing project that maybe needs $50,000, $100,000, $150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2980.23s">and</a>  they could be able to correct whatever it's going to be needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2982.611s">But</a>  it's not being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2984.631s">There's</a>  been no meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2986.072s">There's</a>  been no allowance of the money even to come before the council to be spent and have a presentation said, we're giving this money to Haines Square, this money to West Method, this is what the money is going to be used for, and a representative from each one of the people to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=2999.196s">You</a>  know, this is still taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3001.216s">No</a>  matter how you want to cut it, no matter how it's garnered, the fact of the matter is you have a responsibility as councillors <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3007.297s">to</a>  say, well, if this is what the deal was, $250,000 a year, you haven't even have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3012.44s">You</a>  don't even have a financial report coming back to you, as you've asked on numerous occasions on an annual or semiannual basis, revenue coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3021.446s">We</a>  could just go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3023.387s">But</a>  at least on this particular issue, there's nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3026.349s">There's</a>  nothing to talk about, because there's nothing that's been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3030.132s">And</a>  going back to the CPA, the fact that Larry, could you just do this, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3034.595s">Did</a>  you pass them out? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3036.015s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3037.541s">The</a>  thing in the CPA, we're not taking it away from anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3040.424s">All</a>  we're just saying is you're just going to suspend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3043.166s">Because</a>  if you're being told that you're going to get X amount of dollars back for every dollar that you put up, and you're not getting it, why would you want to still keep going back out there and taxing the rate payers? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3054.757s">And</a>  if you're taking the million dollars that you have already now for the first year, and you should ask for an accounting, it would be nice to have someone behind the rail ask for an accounting of how much money <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3063.522s">did</a>  the city of Medford take in in its first year? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3065.923s">You're</a>  going into your second year of a CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3069.143s">What's</a>  the intent of spending that money? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3071.184s">Where</a>  is the committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3072.604s">What's</a>  their findings? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3073.844s">Where's</a>  the public meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3075.345s">Where's</a>  the public hearing for input? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3078.145s">You're</a>  into the second year of it, three years to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3080.526s">It</a>  just doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3084.046s">You've</a>  got to read the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3084.927s">The</a>  law is very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3087.608s">On</a>  the CPA especially. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3089.269s">After</a>  it was passed and introduced, you put anywhere up to a five to a nine member board. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3095.031s">It's</a>  gotta be done right after the fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3097.472s">You're</a>  supposed to have meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3098.452s">You're</a>  supposed to have this presented to the people.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3100.513s">We</a>  do have a board. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3101.693s">Pardon</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3102.194s">We</a>  do have a board.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3103.434s">You</a>  have a board. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3104.034s">Where's</a>  the public meetings on how to spend the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3108.076s">They've</a>  already had one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3110.057s">Can</a>  you tell me what it was? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3110.897s">I</a>  don't know the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3112.017s">Was</a>  it a public meeting before the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3113.738s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3114.575s">That's</a>  what you've got to read and understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3116.598s">Read</a>  the 12 pages that make up the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3119.022s">It's</a>  very specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3120.544s">And</a>  what I'm offering to you is not to abolish it, but just to put it on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3125.311s">If</a>  you're not going to get reimbursed from the state, then why take it out of the taxpayers of this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3130.718s">And</a>  if you can't get it till the end of the fifth year, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3133.441s">It</a>  was a nice try. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3135.183s">And</a>  if you look at the makeup on how they go, they go by a population standard, and they also go by a tax rate on the appraised property. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3142.431s">And</a>  then it goes into a skew. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3144.653s">It's</a>  a very complex situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3147.136s">But</a>  if we're generating, Mr. President, over a million dollars a year or thereabouts, and we should be getting that back from the taxpayers of this community, we shouldn't even have to worry about historical things in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3159.082s">We</a>  shouldn't have to worry about our parks and open and recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3162.083s">We</a>  shouldn't have to worry about doing things in the area of public housing in that area or anything else that CPA would allow you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3170.187s">But</a>  we don't even know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3171.348s">None</a>  of you know that because you haven't been told what it's going to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3174.969s">You</a>  haven't even had any input. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3177.29s">This</a>  is about as transparent as the number six.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3183.512s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3185.553s">Any</a>  questions from anybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3187.894s">Well,</a>  I'll be back in July and hopefully you'll have some kind of an answer to that because if this council feels that they don't want to go forward, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3197.509s">then</a>  I will just go to the state legislature and ask some representative to pass it, because a lot of these cities and towns, they're starting to feel it now, because people are being taxed for something that they're not getting their money back on.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3209.557s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3215.601s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3216.021s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Joyce Paul]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3217.102s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3217.202s">My</a>  name is Joyce Paul, and I'm in 8 Mason Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3221.965s">I</a>  was recently elected to the state committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3225.304s">And</a>  I had no idea how many people would talk to me about how many issues they would talk to me about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3231.625s">And</a>  money is the number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3234.746s">I</a>  definitely support Bob Penta saying that if we're supposed to get money back from the state and we're not getting it back, then we need to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3247.188s">It</a>  doesn't seem fair to say to people, if you give us 1.5%, the state will match it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3256.19s">And</a>  that will be helpful to the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3258.051s">If</a>  we're not getting the money back, we're not getting the money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3260.993s">And</a>  it's not fair to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3264.016s">I</a>  also support having a little bit more understanding about this $250,000, this $500,000 in the business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3273.763s">I</a>  don't know very much about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3276.125s">But</a>  I do know a number of people have talked about the Preservation Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3280.869s">And</a>  I'm not sure we all know in any way all the details that you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3285.633s">but</a>  I do think that I would like to see us get a little better care and I don't feel like we're getting, you know, the care that we should. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3294.775s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3295.696s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3300.057s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3300.457s">Name</a>  and address the director, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3302.177s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3303.458s">Rob</a>  Capucci, 71 Evans street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3306.318s">Just</a>  to bring up some of the points that Mr. Penta was talking about, excuse me, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3313.365s">Tomorrow</a>  night, there is a meeting of the Community Preservation Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3318.106s">It's</a>  at the high school, I believe, at 5 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3321.446s">The</a>  funds collected so far is $1,200,000, as I believe you know from the subcommittee meetings on the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3331.148s">What</a>  you also know, too, is that, I mean, this also connects to what Lisa was saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3336.509s">I</a>  forget your last name. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3337.429s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3340.75s">The</a>  property taxes, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3343.897s">in</a>  Medford, as the assessor said, are going up an average of 10% to 14%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3349.741s">And</a>  he said that based on historical records. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3353.463s">So</a>  the CPA tax is going to be collecting a lot more money, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3358.526s">One</a>  other clarification I want to make is I was opposed to the CPA in 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3364.409s">And</a>  when it passed, the very next day after the election, I went to the Office of Elections <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3371.55s">Secretary</a>  of State's office, and I asked them, how do we get rid of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3375.956s">And</a>  they said, you don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3378.619s">There's</a>  only one way after five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3381.382s">Now,</a>  maybe what Mr. Penta said is true, but they didn't tell me that, about the city council being able to put it on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3387.59s">But</a>  what was told to me from the Secretary of State's office is, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3391.159s">It</a>  can only get on the ballot to be repealed the same way it got on the ballot to be passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3396.7s">And</a>  that's you have to go out in citizen effort drive to go out and get the signatures, to get this thing on the ballot, to get it repealed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3404.842s">And</a>  one final thing I want to say about the matching from the state is only half of the cities and towns have the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3415.335s">but</a>  all 351 cities and towns pay into the fund that funds the towns that have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3422.639s">So</a>  an unfortunate aspect of this is that lesser affluent communities that don't have the CPA end up, through their taxes, funding more affluent towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3435.645s">We</a>  really don't need the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3438.027s">I</a>  definitely agree with the purposes of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3441.048s">The</a>  preservation of historical landmarks and open spaces, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3445.156s">But</a>  Medford already sits on surpluses and budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3450.037s">We</a>  have a property tax that goes up every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3454.139s">We</a>  have surpluses in other accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3456.399s">There</a>  are other ways that we can do the objectives of the CPA without having the CPA. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3463.581s">And</a>  if Mr. Pinter is right of some way of freezing this or reducing it, please, <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3470.283s">By</a>  all means, do that, because as the last speaker said, this is what's on the mind of the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3475.891s">How</a>  are people going to upkeep their properties when they have the connectivity tax coming at them? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3485.765s">when</a>  they have the perpetual property tax, when they have the meals tax, and the sales tax, and two income taxes, and fees to go to Wrights Pond, and fees for this, that, and the other thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3495.047s">Gene</a>  Neuzil's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3496.247s">This</a>  is death by paper cuts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3499.308s">And</a>  this body has the power to do something about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3503.968s">I</a>  mean, these are our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3505.889s">We</a>  know the people who own these restaurants out here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3508.389s">We</a>  grew up here, our whole lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3510.45s">Please,</a>  common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3512.366s">Please,</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3513.647s">It</a>  was voted on by the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3514.868s">If</a>  you can get it repealed, we'll review the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3519.151s">The</a>  people voted it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3520.332s">Right,</a>  and I sat at a polling center on election day, and as people came in, Mr. President, and they looked at that doctor's prescription of a ballot question, they went up to the poll worker and they said, hey, can you explain this to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3534.644s">And</a>  when they were told, basically, it's a surcharge on your profit, oh, I'm not voting for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3540.125s">You're</a>  right, you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3540.785s">It</a>  was a citizen effort drive, and kudos to Roberta Kammerer for what she did. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3545.847s">I</a>  don't agree with the CPA, but I definitely admire her efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3549.528s">It</a>  was a job well done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3550.948s">But</a>  it was also done in a way that wasn't specifically clear to the voters of this community as to what was actually going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3563.112s">And</a>  that, you're right, it was voted on by the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3568.023s">What</a>  did he say? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3568.583s">1,300</a>  people didn't even vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3570.944s">Most</a>  people didn't even turn it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3573.065s">More</a>  effort should be made to clarify exactly what was being voting on, and that there was even a ballot question. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3580.908s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3581.488s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3585.19s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3586.39s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3588.371s">And</a>  the CPA did pass, much to my dismay. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3593.754s">because</a>  I didn't feel that the question was as clear and everyone had the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3597.335s">But</a>  now that it has passed, when I heard of the Riverside Plaza, I thought, oh, that's a perfect use of our CPA funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3603.837s">And</a>  I'm hoping that there's some way that maybe this commission can say, you know what, let's pay for that Riverside Plaza, even if we have to delay the start of it a few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3612.76s">and</a>  take that $250,000 and put it back into the budget and maybe pave four or five roads in the city and beautify the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3621.687s">Because</a>  who wants to go to a park that's surrounded by streets that are filled with potholes? <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3626.77s">Maybe</a>  we can cover up that railway line on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3629.652s">Because</a>  if we have a specific fund that is created for parkland, historic and low income, then that is definitely the first place that we should go for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3640.46s">A</a>  half a million dollar project that's funded partially by grant money could be completely funded if we use the CPA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3647.406s">And</a>  that would be a benefit to the community since that has passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3650.648s">And</a>  I hope that will happen.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3651.969s">There</a>  is a meeting tomorrow night at 630 at the high school, the superintendent's conference room. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3656.953s">You</a>  can go there and make your suggestions to the members of the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3661.737s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3662.237s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7NOaplsgIuU&t=3662.597s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>
