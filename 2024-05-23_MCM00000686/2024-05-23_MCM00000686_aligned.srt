1
00:00:00,205 --> 00:00:03,786
Hello and welcome to this special meeting of the Medford Zoning Board of Appeals.

2
00:00:04,247 --> 00:00:06,487
We're going to take a quick roll call and then we'll get started.

3
00:00:07,828 --> 00:00:08,488
Jim Tirani?

4
00:00:09,328 --> 00:00:09,729
Present.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,010
Yvette Velez?

6
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:14,810
Present.

7
00:00:17,712 --> 00:00:18,392
Andre LaRue?

8
00:00:19,192 --> 00:00:19,612
Present.

9
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:29,116
And then I believe Jamie Thompson is absent.

10
00:00:30,732 --> 00:00:33,974
And Mary Lee is absent.

11
00:00:34,674 --> 00:00:35,735
Mike Caldera present.

12
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:36,716
So we do have a quorum.

13
00:00:36,756 --> 00:00:37,696
We have four members.

14
00:00:38,217 --> 00:00:50,044
All four members have either attended all sessions of this hearing or missed one and signed the mullet affidavit.

15
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:50,924
So we have four.

16
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,625
That's a quorum.

17
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:53,926
Dennis, could you please kick us off?

18
00:00:57,168 --> 00:01:05,330
On March 2920 23 governor Healy said in the law supplemental budget bill which among other things extends to temporary versions came to the open meeting like March 31st 2025.

19
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:21,733
Typically this further extension last of the bodies can you hold the means remotely but a quorum of the public body physically present location and read adequate alternative access to remote weeks when it's not like any substance of changes that mean well that's in the expiration date of the temporary provisions are going to go into March 31st 2023 to March 31st 2025.

20
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:31,618
We have 9.7 the following person in place.

21
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:36,022
It's not going to go to a case in the 40 be that's 2023 that show one.

22
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:41,147
If you need to make that the resumption of the duration of the issue.

23
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:52,498
The idea feels we'll see the Davis companies for a comprehensive permit pursuant to that just show us chapter 40 be from a family 6 story apartment building located approximately 3.4 acres went into the fells way.

24
00:01:53,224 --> 00:02:04,409
This proposal will be developed in approximately 289 units to 278 units of multifamily housing and 11 townhomes with 73, 25% of the total units will be designated as affordable housing to low or moderate income households.

25
00:02:04,949 --> 00:02:07,190
This hearing will discuss the draft decision and conditions.

26
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:12,036
Thank you.

27
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:13,078
All right, folks.

28
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:14,479
So this is a long running hearing.

29
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:17,062
It's been going since last November.

30
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:22,048
The board has conducted a number of sessions.

31
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:31,400
We've reviewed everything ranging from the architecture, the site plan to the civil engineering considerations, the traffic considerations that we've even

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,124
reviewed the requested waivers, some proposed draft conditions.

33
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:42,868
And so today is the planned closure of the hearing.

34
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:52,975
We'll make an evaluation at some point if that needs to change, but the intention going into this meeting is to close the hearing today.

35
00:02:53,835 --> 00:03:00,200
And as Dennis mentioned, the focus will be review of the draft conditions.

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,680
and the waivers.

37
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:09,224
And at this point, I do not necessarily intend to take public comment.

38
00:03:09,844 --> 00:03:15,907
We did take public comment on the conditions and waivers in our last session of the hearing.

39
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:26,931
If the discussion veers into territory where there is something met new or unexpected, that would be the circumstance in which we would reopen public comment.

40
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,692
So yeah, that's the intention.

41
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,495
see some some back and forth prior to the meeting.

42
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:43,261
So there have been a couple of iteration cycles on the draft decision that we reviewed in our last meeting on Thursday.

43
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,422
Thank you for the quick turnaround on those.

44
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:47,723
So we'll be talking a little bit about that.

45
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:54,688
I also the board also received some details regarding the open question on linkage.

46
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:58,169
And so I do intend to have a discussion on that.

47
00:03:58,869 --> 00:04:06,111
We can discuss at that time if any of the open items merit additional time or things we can bottom out today.

48
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:09,472
So yeah, that's my intention.

49
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:12,293
I see we have multiple representatives for the applicant.

50
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,114
So I'll just check in with Pat Noon to start.

51
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:20,296
I think one of the first things we'll do is have Attorney Haverty go through

52
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:34,400
the latest iteration of the decision and kind of talk through the changes that have been made and any open issues that aren't yet resolved by the lawyers involved.

53
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:43,963
But before we do that, I'll check in with Pat just to see if there's anything else we should be discussing today or anything you want to lead off with.

54
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:49,598
Mr. Chair, members of the board, thank you again for having us this evening.

55
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:57,723
I do not have anything to add to the program that you just laid out for this evening, so.

56
00:04:59,764 --> 00:04:59,904
Okay.

57
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:01,445
Wonderful.

58
00:05:01,865 --> 00:05:04,887
Well, in that case, I will turn it over to Attorney Haberdee.

59
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:11,971
Mr. Chair, as discussed, the applicant has provided

60
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:19,739
a number of additional comments and information to the draft decision that was discussed last week.

61
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,160
Those comments and additional information were very helpful.

62
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:35,583
I would say that the vast majority of the changes that were proposed are really very ministerial, correcting either omissions or mislabeling of things.

63
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:46,814
A lot of consolidation, you know, this draft decision, you know, was born out of numerous prior decisions that are prepared.

64
00:05:46,835 --> 00:05:51,776
And at some point, things start getting repeated in multiple different areas.

65
00:05:51,836 --> 00:05:55,078
So there was some helpful consolidation.

66
00:05:55,198 --> 00:06:01,400
There are still a few areas in which I think the board asked you to propose changes.

67
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,962
And what I would propose to do is just go through the draft decision and cover those changes.

68
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:12,147
And as promised at the last meeting, I have also operated the waiver decisions at the end.

69
00:06:13,268 --> 00:06:17,252
So, we can go through those and I know linkage question is addressed in the waivers.

70
00:06:17,813 --> 00:06:22,537
So, I think, you know, if you want to, we can wait until we get to that point in the waivers to discuss that.

71
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:28,403
So, I have nothing on the screen.

72
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:36,489
Dennis, it may be helpful.

73
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:38,189
Sorry, I think my connection is a little unstable.

74
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,090
Would you like someone to share?

75
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:41,291
Yes.

76
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:47,894
If Dennis could put up the version that I sent just a little while ago, the mostly clean version.

77
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:55,898
So I've got no outstanding issues on page one.

78
00:06:57,352 --> 00:07:05,331
On number 7 on page 2, we're just going to need to verify the dates, you know, when the hearing is closed, because we haven't really quite reached that point yet.

79
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:11,018
Again, at number eight, there's a blank there for when the board deliberated.

80
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,722
There may not actually be a formal deliberation process.

81
00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:30,413
If the board finishes its review of this decision while the public hearing is still open and then just closes the hearing and issues a decision, that is an appropriate way to proceed, and you would never actually go into a formal deliberation, and that's fine.

82
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:47,369
On page 3, number 13, the applicant is just looking for confirmation with regards to the attendance of all the board members and who the eligible voters are.

83
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:53,673
Page 5, number 21,

84
00:07:56,445 --> 00:08:07,534
I am still waiting for information from the applicant relating to what percentage of the site will be covered by impervious surface, and that should not say imperious.

85
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:23,146
So if the applicant could provide that information, that would be helpful.

86
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:30,871
On page, nothing on page 6.

87
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:41,678
On page 7, we are waiting for the applicant to provide the revision dates for the cube 3 plans.

88
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:50,924
On.

89
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:59,764
Page 8, A5, we are waiting for the applicant to provide information regarding the heights of the proposed buildings.

90
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:14,896
On A6, the applicant proposed a change to the draft condition that said that there'll be approximately 324 vehicle parking spaces.

91
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:18,739
And I'm just questioning why the word approximately is in there.

92
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:21,161
We should have an exact figure for that.

93
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:40,545
On A7, the applicant has proposed additional language that states any increased or new waivers required on account of revisions to the approved plan to accommodate the conditions of this decision would essentially be accepted as insubstantial changes.

94
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:46,491
I just want the board to be aware that that would mean that you're not really getting an opportunity

95
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:52,234
to take a vote on those changes.

96
00:09:52,314 --> 00:10:02,882
But ultimately, if they are required on account of conditions of the board's decision, then that really shouldn't require a new approval process.

97
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,023
So that should be fine.

98
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:13,591
On 8.8, the applicant has proposed- Attorney Haverty, it looks like the building commissioner had a-

99
00:10:16,497 --> 00:10:20,558
Yeah, I did have one comment about the EV stations.

100
00:10:20,618 --> 00:10:29,160
It's ultimately going to be the stretch energy code that's going to decide the number of them, unless you guys pick more than the stretch energy code required.

101
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:33,401
I hate to lock it into a number and have the building code say it's a slightly different number.

102
00:10:37,022 --> 00:10:40,223
So, Scott, what number is that?

103
00:10:42,695 --> 00:10:46,777
It's 20, I believe the number is going to be 20% of the number of parking spaces.

104
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:48,458
No, what number condition?

105
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,441
Oh, you were just at it, just above this for the EV stations.

106
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:55,422
Yeah, right there.

107
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:55,462
A6.

108
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:58,603
A6.

109
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:03,226
It'll be subject ultimately to the stretch energy code and the building code review.

110
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,228
All right, so this is not,

111
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:10,346
providing a number of, I think there is somewhere else in the decision.

112
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:16,288
I think it was like 66 electrical vehicle charging stations, but it's not in this condition.

113
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,550
So- Well, you could ask for an exact number of EV stations.

114
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:25,552
No, no, I was asking for an exact number of parking spaces, total parking spaces.

115
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:26,492
Okay, all right.

116
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:27,873
Because they're saying approximately 324.

117
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,153
Okay.

118
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:33,695
And I don't know why it's approximately, there should be an exact number there.

119
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,720
Okay, that's fine.

120
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,041
I just heard you say EV station.

121
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:38,281
I thought, oh, maybe we're pinning that down.

122
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:40,722
So, okay, thanks.

123
00:11:40,982 --> 00:11:54,666
A8, and Scott, you may want to review this one, because so my original draft gave the city 45 days to review the final plans and sign off on them.

124
00:11:56,547 --> 00:11:59,668
The applicant is proposing that that time period be shortened to 30 days.

125
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:07,340
You know, it's usually a give and take on that question.

126
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,921
I've seen some decisions where they've, you know, had it as 90 days.

127
00:12:12,262 --> 00:12:16,824
I know that developers generally, you know, want that time period to be shorter because time is money.

128
00:12:17,464 --> 00:12:25,407
So, it's really just a question of whether or not, you know, the city staff thinks that they can turn the review over in that time period.

129
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,831
The building codes is 30 days we shall respond.

130
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:33,532
It doesn't say you shall have an approved permit within 30 days, just that we shall respond.

131
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:43,275
If we respond within 30 days that we want to go out for review for a peer review or something like that, that'll certainly take more than 30 days to get through all of that process.

132
00:12:44,995 --> 00:12:53,738
There is a provision in here that if you send out for a peer review, then the time clock doesn't stop ticking until the consultant's fee has been fully funded.

133
00:12:56,784 --> 00:12:57,024
Right.

134
00:12:57,044 --> 00:13:00,367
But I can't guarantee that an outside reviewer is going to crank it out in 30 days.

135
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:04,029
We haven't reached out to anybody at this point to see what it'll take.

136
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:04,330
So.

137
00:13:05,871 --> 00:13:12,276
So that's, you know, that's a determination for the board to make as to, you know, what's the appropriate amount of time.

138
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:15,958
Yep.

139
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:20,702
So leaving that condition.

140
00:13:23,755 --> 00:13:39,313
B1, there was a suggestion from one of the board members for additional language, which I've added the applicant shall maintain records as required by the subsidizing agency relating to the location and occupancy of the affordable units for the project.

141
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:43,197
I also had another question.

142
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:58,546
This says that 73 of the units shall be affordable, but if the total number of units is 283, then my calculation is that it only requires 71 units to be affordable, rounded up from 70.75.

143
00:13:58,646 --> 00:14:02,268
So I just want to confirm that.

144
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:09,533
Yes, Senator Gallagher.

145
00:14:11,162 --> 00:14:20,805
Thank you Mister chair, just wanted to quickly clarify and I'll avoid jumping in because I know there are a lot of comments, but just to avoid any confusion, the number of units has not changed.

146
00:14:21,265 --> 00:14:27,387
It's still 289, 283 are in the multifamily building and six are in the townhome building.

147
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:39,451
Okay, maybe I was misreading a change that you made because I thought elsewhere in here, this is 230.

148
00:14:44,613 --> 00:14:58,366
Okay, so we're going to have to revise 8-4 to make it clear that it's 289 total units consisting of 283 in the multifamily building and 6 townhouse rental units.

149
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:00,929
So, I will make that note.

150
00:15:04,472 --> 00:15:07,015
Sorry, I misunderstood your suggested change there.

151
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:34,471
In B2, there's a suggested revision from a board member as an affordable rental development.

152
00:15:35,072 --> 00:15:41,874
100% of the units in the project shall meet the criteria for inclusion in the subsidized housing inventory maintained by EOHLC.

153
00:15:44,916 --> 00:16:00,442
B5, another suggested condition, the applicant shall provide a copy of the draft affordable fair housing marketing plan to the building commissioner and the office of planning and development and sustainability for review and comment two weeks prior to submittal to the subsidizing agency.

154
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:12,027
The board acknowledges that the approval of the AFHMP is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the subsidizing agency and that its review will be limited to providing comments on the draft plan.

155
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:21,052
That takes us to C1.

156
00:16:24,573 --> 00:16:38,297
So here the applicant has requested a revision that would prohibit the commencement of vertical construction prior to compliance with all of the provisions of this section.

157
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:53,360
Generally speaking, I know that boards liked to prevent commencement of any site work in construction until all of this other post-approval submittals have been complied with.

158
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:57,736
I know that this site is a little different in that it's an already developed site.

159
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:03,000
So we're not talking about opening up a previously undisturbed site.

160
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,664
So there's less concern there, but I just wanted the board to be aware of that change.

161
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,031
And then also in C1A,

162
00:17:22,977 --> 00:17:37,092
The applicant has proposed language that states any separate fee due at building permit issuance shall be reduced by any amounts paid by the applicant for technical reviews and inspections by outside experts hired by the building commissioner or the board here under.

163
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:41,297
So, this provision is looking for an offset

164
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,762
from their building permit fees for any peer review fees that are paid.

165
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:54,926
And I presume that's for peer review fees for reviewing the final plans, not for any peer reviews that have occurred to date.

166
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:07,372
Subsection C, again, is that 45 day period proposed to be reduced to 30 days.

167
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:22,748
Subsection D, just note that the applicant has noted that their agreements to this condition is subject to its review by their landscape architect.

168
00:18:22,788 --> 00:18:24,049
I don't know that that's occurred yet.

169
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:37,019
Subsection E, again, has the language regarding vertical construction and the reduction from 45 days to 30 days.

170
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:53,636
on page 15 C2 subsection H. I guess I just wasn't really clear on why this was being changed.

171
00:18:53,716 --> 00:19:00,740
It's stated originally the applicant will be responsible for all applicable water and sewer system fees.

172
00:19:01,781 --> 00:19:09,045
And this just states the proposal is to change it to accept responsibility for all applicable water and sewer system fees.

173
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:12,367
I'm not really sure how that changes the condition.

174
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:19,788
Moving on.

175
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:27,611
We're going to go a ways before the next one.

176
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:29,512
E13 on page 21.

177
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:35,214
The applicant has

178
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:53,217
proposed a revision to this condition to state to the extent recommended by the applicant's LSP.

179
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:57,239
I'm not really sure that that's appropriate here.

180
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:08,485
The purpose of this testing condition was really just to confirm that the soil types in the areas of the stormwater management system are consistent with what has been presumed to be in place.

181
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:13,448
I don't know that the applicant's LSP would even look at that as a question.

182
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:18,842
So, I'm not sure that this proposed change is appropriate.

183
00:20:21,348 --> 00:20:21,609
On E14.

184
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:28,717
There's a lot of language in here relating to the construction activities.

185
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:33,640
The first proposed change is they're adding the word exterior construction activities.

186
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,042
So I wanted the board to be aware of that.

187
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:45,848
As currently drafted with that change, there would be no restriction on interior construction activities.

188
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:50,912
So if the board wants to place some sort of restriction on that, then they would need to revise this.

189
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:05,913
E16 is a proposal to add the phrase without appropriate temporary stabilization.

190
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:08,135
I don't think that's necessary.

191
00:21:08,155 --> 00:21:10,256
It's the original condition.

192
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:15,438
No building area shall be left in an open, unstabilized condition longer than 60 days.

193
00:21:15,598 --> 00:21:21,401
So if there's appropriate temporary stabilization, then it hasn't been left in an open, unstabilized condition.

194
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:40,516
So there is an E21, the proposed deletion of neither snow nor sand may be placed in or adjacent to resource areas.

195
00:21:40,576 --> 00:21:48,902
And I presume the purpose of this deletion is that there are no resource areas within the project site.

196
00:21:51,283 --> 00:21:54,905
I'm not sure that that means we need to delete this or not.

197
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:58,588
If there are no resource areas, then it's not applicable.

198
00:22:00,145 --> 00:22:03,169
So, it doesn't hurt to have it in there, but that's really for the board to decide.

199
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:11,741
There are a number of proposed additional conditions that the applicant has provided beginning at E28.

200
00:22:14,342 --> 00:22:19,085
All rooftop equipment associated with the project shall be installed as shown on the approved plans.

201
00:22:20,386 --> 00:22:37,956
E29, the applicant will enter into an agreement with the City with respect to sidewalks, walkways, and publicly accessible parking spaces along Amaranth Avenue and Myrtle Street to be constructed on portions of the project site in accordance with this decision, which will provide a license to the public to utilize such areas.

202
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:42,859
The use by members of the public of any such walkways internal to the project site

203
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:46,770
shall be subject to the applicant's rules and regulations from time to time.

204
00:22:47,752 --> 00:22:53,815
F30, the applicant shall explore opportunities for incorporating public art into the project, e.g.

205
00:22:53,915 --> 00:22:55,536
murals, outdoor sculptures.

206
00:22:56,156 --> 00:23:05,040
The applicant shall review its proposals with the Medford Arts Council and document such review with the board prior to the implementation of any such elements within the project.

207
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:16,265
In E31, upon the completion of the proposed Wellington Connector multi-use pathway contemplated along the former rail line immediately south of the project site,

208
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:25,098
The applicant will permit future public access to the Wellington Connector in the southeast corner of the project site as shown on the approved plans.

209
00:23:27,827 --> 00:23:40,534
On page 24, F2, the applicant has proposed deleting signs and markings shall conform to the manual on uniform traffic control devices, latest edition, and other applicable state or local requirements.

210
00:23:41,315 --> 00:23:44,656
I'm not clear on why this language is proposed to be stricken.

211
00:23:44,676 --> 00:23:46,938
It is a pretty standard condition.

212
00:23:50,316 --> 00:23:50,676
F3.

213
00:23:53,018 --> 00:23:53,258
Yes.

214
00:23:53,939 --> 00:23:57,722
You know, the engineering department does have a traffic engineer.

215
00:23:58,483 --> 00:24:00,804
Would that be left to his determination?

216
00:24:03,807 --> 00:24:04,628
It certainly could be.

217
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:14,976
I just know that the MUTCD is sort of the standard for traffic signage, and that's, you know, a condition that every decision I issue, you know, that condition is in there.

218
00:24:16,152 --> 00:24:16,893
be expected.

219
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:18,754
I've never seen an objection to it before.

220
00:24:18,774 --> 00:24:24,597
Okay, just as long as you understand, you'll have to work through those details with the traffic engineer that the city has.

221
00:24:24,617 --> 00:24:26,578
If there's any questions.

222
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:50,215
F3, the applicant has requested the board's approval include authorization for such shared parking pursuant to section 6.1.9 of the zoning ordinance and for such reduced number of parking spaces pursuant to section 6.1.10 of the zoning ordinance.

223
00:24:50,275 --> 00:24:53,259
I just want to bring that addition to the board's attention.

224
00:24:57,488 --> 00:25:07,233
The applicant has proposed deleting condition F7, which states the applicant shall maintain site distance at the entrance to the site consistent with AASHTO criteria.

225
00:25:08,014 --> 00:25:09,354
This is a safety question.

226
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:12,136
I'm not sure why this provision is being deleted.

227
00:25:13,397 --> 00:25:15,578
So I would ask the applicant to address that.

228
00:25:27,458 --> 00:25:29,739
F11, the applicant has proposed deleting.

229
00:25:30,439 --> 00:25:41,744
The applicant shall coordinate with the City of Medford to assess the feasibility of upgrading traffic signal equipment and providing new pedestrian signals at the intersection of Central Avenue and Spring Street.

230
00:25:41,784 --> 00:25:46,986
So this was a condition that was proposed by the board's peer review engineer.

231
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:51,228
So the board should discuss this proposed deletion as well.

232
00:25:53,849 --> 00:26:02,938
F12, the applicant has proposed deleting language to install a new shelter equipped with appropriate amenities just south of the proposed Fellsway driveway.

233
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:05,100
Again, this came from the peer review consultant.

234
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:22,203
F13, the applicant shall, in coordination with the City of Medford, the applicant is proposed deleting to assess the feasibility of implementing traffic calming improvement and devices, such as curb extensions and slash or a raised intersection.

235
00:26:22,743 --> 00:26:31,726
They want to change that to simply state that the applicant shall, in coordination with the City of Medford, implement curb extensions and deleted and or raised intersections.

236
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:37,654
Finally, F15, the applicant is proposed deleting.

237
00:26:37,694 --> 00:26:46,676
The applicant shall provide the City of Medford with a wayfinding signage plan, which shall be implemented by the applicant upon approval by the City of Medford.

238
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:53,037
Again, this came from your peer review consultant, so wanted the board to be aware of this proposed deletion.

239
00:26:56,718 --> 00:26:57,438
Page 28, G6 through G10.

240
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:09,419
The applicant is proposing to delete all of these conditions.

241
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:15,805
And I believe that in a number of instances, it's because they are redundant with earlier provisions.

242
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:22,430
Although I'm not sure that everything that's in here is covered in the earlier conditions.

243
00:27:23,151 --> 00:27:32,579
So I would want the opportunity to review that a little more closely to make sure that we are not deleting any information that is necessary to remain.

244
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:49,910
H2, the applicant has proposed deleting the language with calculations to ensure the distribution system for the area has the necessary capacity to meet system demand required.

245
00:27:53,232 --> 00:28:02,056
So eliminating this doesn't really address the purpose of this condition, which is to ensure that there is sufficient capacity.

246
00:28:04,597 --> 00:28:06,538
H3, again, they're proposing to delete

247
00:28:07,634 --> 00:28:13,116
as redundant, and I would just want to make sure that it's actually contained elsewhere.

248
00:28:13,877 --> 00:28:34,906
This condition is technically a beneficial condition to the applicant in that it provides that if the fire department requires hydrant locations different than what's on the approved plans, the applicant can simply update the plans, show the new locations, and those modifications will be accepted as an insubstantial change.

249
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:54,385
H5, the applicant is proposing to delete water utilities servicing the buildings in the project shall be installed and tested in accordance with applicable city requirements and protocols, except as may be waived herein.

250
00:28:54,405 --> 00:29:00,889
The applicant's proposing to delete that language, and I wanted an explanation as to why.

251
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:05,352
H7, I just wanted information as to what size diameter water main is proposed.

252
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:21,364
In section I, I-2 through I-5, again, it deals with wetland resource areas, which I'm presuming the applicant is deleting because there are no wetland resource areas.

253
00:29:22,645 --> 00:29:30,592
But again, it doesn't hurt to have them, you know, have this language still in the decision just as a safety measure.

254
00:29:35,324 --> 00:29:41,288
So, in what was originally I-7, as revised by the applicant, it would be I-3.

255
00:29:41,828 --> 00:29:47,071
The applicant is noting that their agreement to this condition is subject to further review by the applicant.

256
00:29:47,731 --> 00:29:50,113
I don't know whether that further review has occurred.

257
00:29:55,743 --> 00:30:05,291
Uh, and I, what was I 11 is now shown as I 7 again deals with the commencement of vertical construction rather than just the commencement of construction.

258
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:08,013
So, the board needs to review that question.

259
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:16,519
I did have a question because there's a bit of an inconsistency between this condition and the waivers.

260
00:30:17,936 --> 00:30:21,739
Regarding who exactly the applicant is requesting approve.

261
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:34,968
The plan at the end of the process, whether they want the board to approve it as part of the comprehensive permit process, or whether they're going to get a plan approved by the community development board.

262
00:30:35,589 --> 00:30:38,050
Outside of the 40 B process, either approach.

263
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:41,153
Is acceptable I just want a clarification on that.

264
00:30:42,314 --> 00:30:46,723
I don't believe that an A&R plan has yet been submitted for the board to review.

265
00:30:47,444 --> 00:30:51,092
So until the board sees that plan, they can't endorse it.

266
00:30:59,787 --> 00:31:04,653
G3, the applicant proposed adding language at the board's request.

267
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:11,380
The applicant shall provide boards with copies of correspondence between the applicant and any federal, state or city official.

268
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:23,270
My problem with that language is that the board is not going to be aware of when the applicant is engaging in correspondence with any federal state officials.

269
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:31,196
So the board wouldn't be able to request to be copied on those other than through the imposition of this condition.

270
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:39,448
J4, I had a question as to whether or not overnight parking of vehicles on public ways is allowed in the City of Medford.

271
00:31:39,468 --> 00:31:43,311
I see the applicant has stricken this language.

272
00:31:43,371 --> 00:31:46,914
I presume that means that overnight parking is allowed.

273
00:31:48,094 --> 00:31:50,896
But I would wait for the board to address that.

274
00:31:53,638 --> 00:31:57,081
So that's the end of the changes to the decision.

275
00:32:03,132 --> 00:32:08,435
So then I have also prepared the decision, the suggested decision on waivers.

276
00:32:08,495 --> 00:32:17,700
And again, as I had discussed at the last meeting, these are suggested waiver decisions.

277
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,082
They are not an obligation for the board to agree with them.

278
00:32:22,222 --> 00:32:28,125
This is just what I saw as necessary for the project to move forward as proposed.

279
00:32:29,466 --> 00:32:31,087
I don't know if you wanna go through these

280
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:38,032
One by one, it's gonna be a little bit redundant from the waivers that were reviewed last time, Mr. Chair.

281
00:32:40,753 --> 00:32:41,493
Good question.

282
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:49,555
So, okay, I'm just thinking through what we need to accomplish in this meeting.

283
00:32:49,655 --> 00:32:58,298
So I am gonna want a discussion with the applicant about some of your open questions, Attorney Haverty, in terms of the,

284
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,465
changes to the proposed conditions because we're going to need to decide one way or the other on each of those.

285
00:33:06,205 --> 00:33:25,802
And then similarly, the board's ultimately going to have to be comfortable with any, especially any waivers that were kind of non-technical and not just implied by the plans that were

286
00:33:27,841 --> 00:33:30,842
approving or denying.

287
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:49,685
So I think at some point we'll have to go through the highlights of the waivers at least, but maybe we should first focus on the conditions and just see if we can bottom out the, you know, the open items there.

288
00:33:51,685 --> 00:33:54,206
Does that sound reasonable to you, Attorney Haverty?

289
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,046
Yeah, that sounds fine.

290
00:33:56,746 --> 00:33:56,906
Okay.

291
00:33:59,803 --> 00:34:00,323
All right, great.

292
00:34:00,343 --> 00:34:04,586
Well, I know there was a lot that we just went through there.

293
00:34:05,107 --> 00:34:20,278
And I think it probably makes sense to just go through them one by one, unless the attorneys for the applicant have a better idea or a proposal.

294
00:34:22,945 --> 00:34:29,690
Okay, actually, I'm going to check in quickly with Member LaRue, and then I'll go to Attorney Tam next.

295
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:30,370
Yeah.

296
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:31,991
Yeah, thanks, Mr. Chairman.

297
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:36,114
Just a question about how we'll address the linkage issue.

298
00:34:36,134 --> 00:34:48,523
We're going to need a discussion on linkage specifically that's currently only living in the waivers

299
00:34:50,118 --> 00:34:55,262
portion, and so I intend for us to have a focal discussion on that topic.

300
00:34:55,742 --> 00:35:03,649
But let's see if we can bottom out some of the simpler items first, and then we'll make that a focal topic.

301
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:04,569
Sounds good.

302
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:04,950
Thank you.

303
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,311
OK, great.

304
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:09,013
Attorney Tam, please go ahead.

305
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,335
Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the board.

306
00:35:12,415 --> 00:35:16,438
I don't want to lose sight of the fact that a lot of progress has been made.

307
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:18,140
We feel very good about

308
00:35:19,622 --> 00:35:41,295
working with Attorney Haverty and with the board on your ultimate approval of a decision that the applicant and Davis Companies is very satisfied with and feels that can be constructed and successfully operated.

309
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:46,038
And I appreciate Paul Haverty's

310
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:53,950
very quick responsiveness to our, I guess, thorough comments.

311
00:35:55,270 --> 00:36:04,753
I would characterize, I'm not sure if it's that productive to spend the board's time on each of these items, which there are a number of them.

312
00:36:04,813 --> 00:36:15,096
Most of them are fairly technical and we think through a further discussion with Paul Haverty, we can probably resolve at least to his satisfaction and we can report back.

313
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:33,098
Just stepping back, because we've also been working with staff and with Attorney Haverty on the question of linkage, we do think, and this is my effort to sort of short circuit, I guess, the question that's been raised.

314
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:41,546
We do think that a continuance may be appropriate to resolve this and just make productive use of

315
00:36:42,314 --> 00:36:43,715
of the board's time this evening.

316
00:36:44,215 --> 00:37:00,903
We could certainly focus on the substantive issues that attorney have already raised, particularly with respect to, um, transportation and, uh, and and the transportation related questions, which are about a half dozen that he raises.

317
00:37:02,068 --> 00:37:05,372
And we can explain why we either modified or removed.

318
00:37:05,452 --> 00:37:12,260
But the other items I don't know if it's unless there's a specific question from a board member or anyone else.

319
00:37:12,681 --> 00:37:18,708
Um, we think we can address these in short order by a discussion with Attorney Haverty after this meeting.

320
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,572
But this is all contingent on

321
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:35,488
I guess this is unusual for an applicant, but we acknowledge that in discussions with Attorney Haverty and Director Hunt and Danielle and others, Dennis this morning, that

322
00:37:38,293 --> 00:37:42,055
there is a little bit more work to do to finalize this decision.

323
00:37:42,655 --> 00:37:44,056
And we don't want to be hasty.

324
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:53,720
So we're prepared to consent to an appropriate continuation if the board deems that necessary.

325
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,982
But if you want to put your head down, we're prepared to do that as well.

326
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:01,303
I just offer this as a way to save time this evening.

327
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:04,624
Yeah, thank you, Attorney Tam.

328
00:38:04,744 --> 00:38:07,044
I think that's really the question of the evening.

329
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:22,709
I agree in a world where it's necessary and appropriate to continue some of these, especially these technical, the language on some of these technical waivers would be pretty easy to iron out offline.

330
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:29,291
But in a world where the board's closing the hearing today, we need to vote on something.

331
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:30,812
So, you know,

332
00:38:31,872 --> 00:38:49,808
If so one possibility would be maybe let's let's pull forward the linkage discussion and just see how far we get and then that might inform whether indeed a continuance is necessary and how we spend our time for the rest of the evening.

333
00:38:49,888 --> 00:38:51,930
Does that sound good to you?

334
00:38:54,326 --> 00:38:55,706
Mr. Chairman, that makes sense to us.

335
00:38:55,766 --> 00:39:09,533
And we did, Pat Noon in particular did his homework at your request at the session last Thursday to prepare sort of an overall list of sort of the package of mitigation that

336
00:39:10,308 --> 00:39:14,310
on the Davis companies is prepared to entertain as part of this project.

337
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:26,314
We've also had a discussion, and I think the question on linkage is not resolved to our satisfaction, to Director Hunt's satisfaction, and I won't speak for Paul Haverty.

338
00:39:26,354 --> 00:39:30,676
He can certainly, but I think that a lot of work has gone into that.

339
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:37,759
We'd like to continue that discussion because I know Director Hunt has involved DPW and engineering

340
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:42,613
And we think it's important to have a further conversation.

341
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,374
We haven't had that opportunity yet.

342
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:48,136
I know Pat Noon was trying to set that up for this week.

343
00:39:48,176 --> 00:39:54,220
So my conclusion, and this is

344
00:39:55,395 --> 00:40:04,643
Again, both Pat Noon and Mike Cantalupa and myself would love for the board to be satisfied and close this, but we don't want to be hasty.

345
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:18,135
We want to have an opportunity to provide clarifications in the course of an open hearing to the extent necessary and not have that be a question of whether or not it amounts to substantive testimony.

346
00:40:18,175 --> 00:40:22,559
So because I think the DPW and Engineering's comments

347
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:42,128
we just received this morning haven't had an opportunity to to engage with them that in and of itself led us to conclude that that a reasonable extension is appropriate understood thank you so there's a few things i just want to

348
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:48,121
of clarify to set the stage for this discussion.

349
00:40:48,181 --> 00:40:59,129
So there's, so first of all, the board did receive some of the back and forth correspondence regarding linkage for members of the public that didn't see the last hearing.

350
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:06,174
Essentially, there is a question of whether this project is even subject to the

351
00:41:08,113 --> 00:41:10,236
the linkage portion of Medford's ordinance.

352
00:41:10,837 --> 00:41:25,336
And so the board, so I know the applicant discussed with the city the topic of whether the project is or isn't subject to a linkage payment obligation.

353
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:47,530
And then, as Attorney Tam mentioned, we did also receive some details with estimates of some of the voluntary improvements that might qualify for linkage credits for the board's consideration.

354
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,651
So there's a few.

355
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,341
things I want to get out of the way and clarify.

356
00:41:54,361 --> 00:42:11,044
So first of all, whether or not this project is subject to linkage, whatever the board finds, that does not change the board's ability to then fully waive linkage or partially waive linkage.

357
00:42:12,544 --> 00:42:14,005
That's within the board's discretion.

358
00:42:16,025 --> 00:42:19,106
The board is passed with balancing

359
00:42:20,427 --> 00:42:24,909
the regional need for affordable housing with local concerns.

360
00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:29,170
And one of those local concerns is, in fact, infrastructure.

361
00:42:29,911 --> 00:42:39,754
And so there is a balance, and it's important that the board not take any action that would render the project uneconomic.

362
00:42:40,534 --> 00:42:47,357
And so the board is not required in the grant of a grant

363
00:42:48,013 --> 00:43:10,821
partial waiver for something that is subject to the linkage ordinance to ground the number of that waiver in a bottoms-up analysis of linkage credits that would otherwise be granted through the standard process for linkage so that the board can

364
00:43:11,651 --> 00:43:25,623
review the information at hand and try to get to a reasonable number considering these details of course it should be grounded in something meaningful but it the board doesn't need to get to a specific

365
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:30,419
number derived from bottoms-up analysis.

366
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:55,927
Keeping this all in mind, my thought as to how we should proceed and make the best use of everybody's time is first, I will attempt to summarize and then the applicant can certainly add to this the positions on whether this project is subject to linkage at all.

367
00:43:57,015 --> 00:44:07,760
then the board will, if a member chooses, will make a motion to find, one way or the other, the project is or isn't subject to linkage.

368
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,764
That should, for the purposes of this hearing at least, settle the issue of whether it applies.

369
00:44:15,404 --> 00:44:24,048
And then, in the event that it does apply, we can have a discussion about whether the board has enough information to

370
00:44:26,459 --> 00:44:37,987
you know, propose a order to determine whether to grant a full or partial waiver of the linkage or if it really would benefit from these follow-up discussions.

371
00:44:38,528 --> 00:44:43,391
So that's how I'm currently thinking about it and planning to proceed.

372
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:50,156
But I'll check back in with Attorney Tim in case there's anything you'd like to discuss before we go down that path.

373
00:44:58,491 --> 00:45:00,792
Mr. Chairman, I'm trying to follow.

374
00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:14,874
If I understood your plan, you'd like the board to consider whether or not to apply the linkage fee by vote of the board this evening?

375
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:26,297
I see no reason to continue with there still being uncertainty in the air about whether the board

376
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:33,568
believes under the Medford ordinance this project is or isn't subject to linkage.

377
00:45:33,608 --> 00:45:46,492
So I'm attempting to short circuit a potentially protracted discussion about that aspect simply by stating the positions and then having the board formally find one way or the other.

378
00:45:47,252 --> 00:45:50,974
Then everything else kind of can follow from there.

379
00:45:51,774 --> 00:45:57,256
And so the board's finding tonight doesn't preclude continuing

380
00:45:58,843 --> 00:46:08,829
it merely hones the focus to, is this a discussion we even need to be having, A, and then B, if it is,

381
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:13,820
you know, what are the pertinent details?

382
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,522
So I think that will kind of, whether we continue or not, help to get us closer to where we need to go.

383
00:46:21,002 --> 00:46:35,246
And I certainly am of the opinion that the very detailed written clarification from Goulston as to the applicant's position as well as

384
00:46:36,555 --> 00:46:43,961
my own reading of the ordinance should be sufficient to get the positions out there and for the board to find one way or the other.

385
00:46:46,684 --> 00:46:53,710
That's what we did in the other hearing where this was an issue under dispute.

386
00:46:57,393 --> 00:47:02,657
Well, Mike, I can appreciate you wanting to resolve this.

387
00:47:02,697 --> 00:47:03,378
We do too.

388
00:47:04,553 --> 00:47:10,996
I do think that this is an issue that the board might consider getting input from council on.

389
00:47:11,676 --> 00:47:15,678
Yeah, so as chair, I've discussed this with council.

390
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:28,344
The exact issue came up in a hearing mid last year and I had about an hour long conversation with them on this exact issue.

391
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,025
So I'll just sort of state my

392
00:47:32,303 --> 00:47:39,766
my understanding, and then members of the board are welcome to form their own interpretations and opinions.

393
00:47:41,827 --> 00:47:43,388
I see member LaRue has his hand raised.

394
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:45,869
Andre, please go ahead.

395
00:47:46,049 --> 00:47:46,890
Thanks, Mike.

396
00:47:49,311 --> 00:47:51,612
So I would

397
00:47:53,256 --> 00:47:56,358
You know, much as I would like to close everything out here tonight.

398
00:47:56,498 --> 00:48:20,751
I mean, I, I would love to kind of have a clean document and be able to see what, um, You know, the, the city and the applicant can come to agreement on in terms of at least how much, uh, You know, what's being invested in the project and, and so that we can consider, uh,

399
00:48:23,272 --> 00:48:29,295
in a very clean way, what it is we're voting on.

400
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:44,322
And I think that given the fact that Attorney Tam just indicated he thought that there could be some agreement between the city and the applicant, I'd love to see what that looks like before voting on anything.

401
00:48:44,402 --> 00:48:46,182
I think last session we,

402
00:48:47,523 --> 00:48:58,933
Harmon Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His): reiterated at least what I heard from board other board members and certainly where I stand is that I, you know, I would like to adopt the same approach that we took with the the prior Harmon Zuckerman, PB – He, Him, His.:

403
00:48:58,933 --> 00:49:06,339
: 40 be project that we we reviewed and it seemed like other board members were also in agreement with that so

404
00:49:08,727 --> 00:49:22,973
I don't know if you're concerned about the process, but I feel like we could handle that all together with a clean document and sort of do, do everything all at once, the conditions, the linkage, and, uh, you know, as a series of, of items.

405
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:33,177
So Andrew, just to clarify, are, are you of the opinion that the

406
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:45,476
detailed breakdown that we already received is what would benefit from that discussion?

407
00:49:45,496 --> 00:49:48,998
Are you missing info that you need?

408
00:49:49,018 --> 00:50:01,587
Yeah, my understanding is that there's still, I mean, discussion happening between the applicant and the city.

409
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:27,580
Yeah, so my understanding, and I don't want to speak on anyone's behalf, but is that the discussion is really surrounding, so there is a list that the board now also received, the city received it earlier of

410
00:50:34,108 --> 00:50:53,404
10 items with estimated costs that are potentially items for the board's consideration of granting any partial waiver of linkage.

411
00:50:55,765 --> 00:50:58,267
So to be more specific,

412
00:51:04,419 --> 00:51:07,662
The applicant's position is that this project is not subject to linkage.

413
00:51:08,663 --> 00:51:21,816
But if it were, that there are a collection of improvements that in totality more than qualify for a full waiver of linkage.

414
00:51:23,717 --> 00:51:27,081
And so I believe the intention

415
00:51:29,109 --> 00:51:54,557
if we were to grant a continuation would be mostly to see if the city and the applicant can align on which of those 10 items would or would not outside of the 40B process be considered as eligible for linkage waivers.

416
00:51:56,015 --> 00:52:06,177
and maybe also to have further discussion about whether the project is subject to linkage at all.

417
00:52:07,497 --> 00:52:25,020
But my expectation, which could be wrong, is that if we continue here, there's a chance we hear back that there's agreement amongst lawyers about whether the project is or isn't

418
00:52:26,168 --> 00:52:42,840
subject at all, and then there's agreement amongst the applicant and city staff about which items, if applicable at all, are subject or would be eligible for credits and whether the magnitudes are reasonable.

419
00:52:43,041 --> 00:52:44,582
So that's like the best case scenario.

420
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:55,971
I'm a little worried that we're not really gonna advance most of that a whole lot between now and the next meeting.

421
00:52:56,031 --> 00:53:06,219
In particular, the legal theory is kind of, it's an interpretation thing.

422
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,981
Either it does or it doesn't apply.

423
00:53:09,001 --> 00:53:13,304
And I think the argument for why it doesn't apply is,

424
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:15,980
already well laid out.

425
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:18,762
It's about as well laid out as it's going to be laid out.

426
00:53:18,842 --> 00:53:21,985
So either city legal agrees or they don't.

427
00:53:23,186 --> 00:53:35,516
And then in the case of the, I would anticipate hopefully that the continuation might drive a little bit of convergence in terms of the items that

428
00:53:36,648 --> 00:53:39,690
would otherwise be eligible for linkage credits.

429
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:45,753
But I do think, you know, a number of these are pretty obvious, like the board has

430
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:49,596
Mike, can I just interrupt for a moment?

431
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:51,736
I have not seen this list.

432
00:53:51,957 --> 00:53:54,837
And I don't know if all the other board members have.

433
00:53:54,897 --> 00:54:03,820
But as far as I know, all I've seen is there was a back and forth with the emails that was earlier today with some feedback.

434
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:08,822
But I cannot find that document that's referenced in those emails.

435
00:54:10,903 --> 00:54:15,124
Dennis, do you know if that attachment was sent to the board

436
00:54:17,742 --> 00:54:21,404
or maybe that's the problem.

437
00:54:22,165 --> 00:54:38,854
I would like the opportunity to kind of let them kind of go at it, see if they can agree on the numbers and then be able to look at the list and make decisions as to what to give credits for or not after the city's kind of had their say.

438
00:54:42,156 --> 00:54:42,416
All right.

439
00:54:42,556 --> 00:54:43,837
Other thoughts from the board?

440
00:54:52,629 --> 00:55:18,370
I tend to agree with Andre because I have not seen the list and I think it would be beneficial for my analysis to at least to see if the two parties can arrive at some type of a consensus and that would serve to the efficiency of our analysis and our decision-making.

441
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,621
Okay, Jim, I echo the same thoughts.

442
00:55:25,981 --> 00:55:29,501
It is the room I would feel more comfortable.

443
00:55:31,222 --> 00:55:33,122
Hearing what the city has to say.

444
00:55:33,142 --> 00:55:37,243
And then looking at the list and going from there.

445
00:55:41,484 --> 00:55:49,225
All right, well, yeah, I don't know that if you have thoughts, but it seems like to go that route.

446
00:55:50,736 --> 00:55:51,436
Um, that's fine.

447
00:55:51,496 --> 00:56:03,679
And, um, you know, I, cause I know the MBTA stuff was on their list and things of that nature and, um, you know, whether that's the city or the state conversations.

448
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:11,901
And so, yes, more clarity on, on what that means, um, and how each party views these, these items.

449
00:56:11,921 --> 00:56:13,821
So I would agree with everybody.

450
00:56:15,801 --> 00:56:16,162
Okay.

451
00:56:16,362 --> 00:56:17,882
Well, I'm not gonna.

452
00:56:18,891 --> 00:56:21,892
contradict other members of the board on that one.

453
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:27,475
It sounds like we will need to give this more time.

454
00:56:27,495 --> 00:56:40,901
I still do not see a reason to continue this meeting without at least settling the board's position on whether linkage applies at all.

455
00:56:41,341 --> 00:56:41,601
I don't

456
00:56:42,634 --> 00:56:46,336
I don't really want to have a protracted discussion about this next time.

457
00:56:46,416 --> 00:56:47,997
It's laid out there.

458
00:56:48,097 --> 00:56:57,241
I think the board can just clarify for everyone's benefit whether it does or doesn't apply, and that will hone the discussion.

459
00:56:57,341 --> 00:57:01,223
So I'm just going to put out there the

460
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:12,447
a summary of the applicant's position on this, and I will share my understanding, having already consulted with City Legal.

461
00:57:13,648 --> 00:57:23,938
And then if a member of the board would like to make a motion on this matter and find one way or the other, they can certainly do so.

462
00:57:27,933 --> 00:57:28,093
Yeah.

463
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:39,877
Okay, so Mike, are you saying just for us to make a decision as to whether or not a linkage applies in general, not any specific?

464
00:57:40,297 --> 00:57:41,198
Okay, I know.

465
00:57:41,238 --> 00:57:44,339
Because the whole analysis is moot if the answer is no.

466
00:57:45,479 --> 00:57:53,022
And the reason, at least this portion of the reason for the requested continuous is moot if the answer is no.

467
00:57:54,538 --> 00:58:05,665
Okay, so then I agree with you if the broader question is to whether a general linkage applies or not.

468
00:58:06,645 --> 00:58:07,826
And I do agree with you.

469
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:09,767
Not anything specific.

470
00:58:10,307 --> 00:58:10,708
That's right.

471
00:58:10,748 --> 00:58:12,969
That's the issue I would like to put to rest tonight.

472
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,870
Okay.

473
00:58:17,185 --> 00:58:26,269
There is a specific section of the Medford ordinance with respect to linkage fees.

474
00:58:26,649 --> 00:58:30,131
And so I'm just going to pull it back up.

475
00:58:32,892 --> 00:58:39,175
So the language at issue is from

476
00:58:43,439 --> 00:58:49,121
Chapter 94, section 10.1.4, exemptions.

477
00:58:51,101 --> 00:58:57,924
The following are not development impact projects and will not be subject to development impact project requirements.

478
00:58:59,004 --> 00:59:10,708
Item 3 states, any building, structure, substantial rehabilitation or addition

479
00:59:11,907 --> 00:59:26,442
that is proposed for subsidized or affordable homeowner or rental housing, which falls within the criteria established by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the Department of Housing and Urban Development and confirmed by vote of the Community Development Board.

480
00:59:26,923 --> 00:59:31,708
So outside of the 40B process, a project that

481
00:59:34,152 --> 00:59:59,094
has a building structure, involves a building structure, substantial rehabilitation or addition that is proposed for subsidized or affordable homeowner rental housing as defined by Massachusetts, is exempt from linkage and the Community Development Board in that circumstance would be the ones who confirm that.

482
01:00:00,791 --> 01:00:13,341
And so if I understand the applicant's position correctly, there's emphasis added on the word building.

483
01:00:13,441 --> 01:00:26,351
So because this is a building and it includes subsidized units, the building is exempt.

484
01:00:31,986 --> 01:00:47,596
And specifically, the explanation is, since all units, both market and affordable, in the building are being permitted in accordance with 40B, the exemption applies such that the project is not subject to the linkage fee.

485
01:00:48,036 --> 01:00:51,218
Linkage ordinance does not distinguish between affordable and market units.

486
01:00:51,298 --> 01:00:55,941
Instead, it specifies buildings and structures as proposed for affordable rental housing.

487
01:00:57,383 --> 01:01:17,345
Furthermore, unlike projects in which only the subsidized slash affordable units count towards the subsidized housing inventory maintained by the OHLC, by virtue of being a 25% affordable rental project permitted under 40B, all 289 of the project units will count towards the city's SHI eligible housing.

488
01:01:18,126 --> 01:01:18,327
So,

489
01:01:20,103 --> 01:01:22,964
That's my best understanding of the applicant's position.

490
01:01:23,784 --> 01:01:27,005
I have consulted with city lawyers on the matter.

491
01:01:27,085 --> 01:01:36,868
So first of all, as far as the Medford ordinance is concerned, the SHI isn't relevant.

492
01:01:37,168 --> 01:01:46,210
So Medford has its own definition of affordable, which is

493
01:01:49,561 --> 01:02:00,007
housing units set aside exclusively, affordable housing is housing units set aside exclusively for low or moderate income renters or buyers that remain affordable through long-term restrictions.

494
01:02:01,088 --> 01:02:08,092
So it's not at all, Medford's definition is not at all tethered to the Massachusetts definition.

495
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:15,677
It is units set aside for low or moderate income renters or buyers that remain affordable.

496
01:02:16,197 --> 01:02:16,617
And so,

497
01:02:19,553 --> 01:02:29,262
I do not believe that this project in its totality is, and I'll just pull back up the language.

498
01:02:35,093 --> 01:02:43,642
This project is not in its totality proposed for subsidized or affordable homeowner rental housing.

499
01:02:43,742 --> 01:02:46,585
It's proposed for a combination of things.

500
01:02:47,386 --> 01:02:55,394
So I do not believe the Medford ordinance exempts the entire building or structure.

501
01:02:56,415 --> 01:02:57,577
This exemption

502
01:02:59,142 --> 01:03:07,247
only applies to buildings or structures which are proposed for that express purpose, not for multiple purposes.

503
01:03:08,608 --> 01:03:11,870
So that's my reading of the ordinance.

504
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:15,933
And I did, like I mentioned, consult with city legal on this.

505
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:25,899
So my recommendation, I think it is well with the spirit and intention of the ordinance to exclude

506
01:03:27,065 --> 01:03:33,468
the affordable units from the linkage calculation as we would for any other project.

507
01:03:33,588 --> 01:03:47,476
But I have not bought into the legal theory that the building itself, because it contains some units that are subsidized, is thus exempt under 10.1.4 item three.

508
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:55,035
So just wanted to get that all out there.

509
01:03:55,075 --> 01:03:56,856
I'll check in with Attorney Tim.

510
01:03:57,737 --> 01:04:01,641
Um, I don't know if I misrepresented anything or if there's anything you'd like to add.

511
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:05,724
Oh, no.

512
01:04:05,764 --> 01:04:06,625
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

513
01:04:06,645 --> 01:04:11,969
You know, we frankly disagree, but we don't have to.

514
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:14,511
I don't think we're going to resolve this issue.

515
01:04:14,752 --> 01:04:18,435
Certainly the board, uh, at your prerogative can make

516
01:04:19,278 --> 01:04:31,027
Any determination you want at this point, but I think you outlined our position view that the language of this exemption is clear.

517
01:04:31,308 --> 01:04:33,950
It doesn't make that distinction.

518
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:36,071
It talks about buildings and structures.

519
01:04:36,191 --> 01:04:37,893
It talks about affordable housing.

520
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:42,276
under the criteria established by the commonwealth.

521
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:46,418
And that would be a 40 B affordable housing project.

522
01:04:46,678 --> 01:04:56,861
So I would just know for the benefit of the board, we're not interested in fighting about this.

523
01:04:57,381 --> 01:04:59,422
Didn't wanna have to litigate this this evening.

524
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:07,064
I think we're having good discussions with staff to get essentially to the same result.

525
01:05:07,145 --> 01:05:08,385
And we pointed out that

526
01:05:09,413 --> 01:05:13,835
The mitigation associated with this project is pretty extensive in terms of cost.

527
01:05:14,255 --> 01:05:16,556
And we think that our costs will be confirmed.

528
01:05:17,816 --> 01:05:38,184
When the board has the opportunity to review after presumably the engineering and DPW make their own assessment, we think even if linkage applied, that the costs associated with the voluntary improvements and commitments

529
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:44,439
that the Davis company is making far exceed any potential linkage payment.

530
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:51,743
And so we'd like to allow that to, because I think to your point, the issue will be moved.

531
01:05:52,063 --> 01:06:06,893
And if that's confirmed by city staff and they make a recommendation on it, we're amenable to a condition or acknowledgement

532
01:06:07,735 --> 01:06:10,617
as to the application of linkage.

533
01:06:10,797 --> 01:06:19,101
But until then, we do have to, as you would understand, reserve our rights, because this is quite a significant number to apply.

534
01:06:20,682 --> 01:06:32,928
And I would just point out that in the home rule petition, when linkage was originally adopted by the city, and I'm sure you know this, it's been pointed out by staff as well,

535
01:06:33,566 --> 01:06:38,230
there is reference to one of the purposes being the creation of affordable housing.

536
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:45,695
So I guess that's, you asked for my comment, that's my comment.

537
01:06:46,196 --> 01:06:48,558
I'll defer to the board in terms of how you want to proceed.

538
01:06:48,678 --> 01:07:01,808
We do remain hopeful that in further discussion with city staff, we can get to a comfort level where all of the mitigation that we've offered

539
01:07:03,888 --> 01:07:15,874
We can keep on the table in light of sort of a netting out with the potential for linkage, if that makes sense.

540
01:07:16,534 --> 01:07:24,238
But if linkage were to apply and no credit was given, we cannot maintain all of the mitigation.

541
01:07:24,859 --> 01:07:27,040
It would become an uneconomic situation.

542
01:07:32,547 --> 01:07:54,391
We defer to the board in terms of how you want to proceed, but we remain optimistic that in further consultation we will have an answer as to how staff views the commitments that we are prepared to make in terms of giving credit for potential linkage.

543
01:07:54,771 --> 01:07:59,332
And I understand your own view, and it's news to me that

544
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:05,972
you know, that this has been reviewed, I understood that it would be under review.

545
01:08:08,733 --> 01:08:10,054
Okay, yeah, thank you.

546
01:08:10,194 --> 01:08:18,478
So, like I mentioned, I do think it would be helpful for those discussions for the board to just weigh in on this topic tonight.

547
01:08:19,019 --> 01:08:25,222
It does not, this is not the board asserting

548
01:08:26,922 --> 01:08:34,824
anything in terms of the amount of the payment, perhaps the payment, if it applies at all, should in fact be zero.

549
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:43,167
The board can and will consider the improvements being made in that determination.

550
01:08:43,187 --> 01:08:51,469
I just don't want to head into the next meeting with that big open item looming over us.

551
01:08:51,549 --> 01:08:54,470
It sounds like the conversation is really more about the

552
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,982
the improvements and mitigations themselves.

553
01:08:58,943 --> 01:09:10,737
So my recommendation to the board would be for a member to make a motion to find either that, well, to find one way or the other, either that

554
01:09:12,521 --> 01:09:24,629
Linkage does not apply to this project at all, as the applicant has suggested, or that linkage does apply to the 75% of units that are market rate.

555
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:24,789
Andre.

556
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:51,860
Yeah, I'd like to make a motion to make a determination that the market rate units of this project be subject to Medford's linkage ordinance, reserving the right to credit the applicant with the public improvements against that linkage fee.

557
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:52,720
Do I have a second?

558
01:09:55,423 --> 01:09:55,723
Second.

559
01:09:57,288 --> 01:10:03,010
So, so Mary, I think for reasons of, uh, quorum, I can't count your second.

560
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:04,731
Cause I think you may have missed two.

561
01:10:04,751 --> 01:10:06,051
Oh, okay.

562
01:10:06,071 --> 01:10:06,231
Sorry.

563
01:10:06,351 --> 01:10:07,112
All right.

564
01:10:08,632 --> 01:10:10,173
Uh, do I have a, do I have a second?

565
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:11,833
I'll second.

566
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:13,134
All right.

567
01:10:13,494 --> 01:10:15,034
Uh, we're going to take a roll call.

568
01:10:15,054 --> 01:10:16,095
Yvette?

569
01:10:17,995 --> 01:10:18,116
Aye.

570
01:10:19,096 --> 01:10:19,436
Jim?

571
01:10:20,276 --> 01:10:20,396
Aye.

572
01:10:21,797 --> 01:10:22,197
Andre?

573
01:10:22,217 --> 01:10:22,897
Aye.

574
01:10:24,138 --> 01:10:24,418
Mike?

575
01:10:24,898 --> 01:10:24,978
Aye.

576
01:10:26,297 --> 01:10:40,108
All right, so that's the board's determination, but message heard on the desire to have additional discussions about the mitigations and the appropriate amount.

577
01:10:40,389 --> 01:10:43,571
I do see the value in continuing those discussions.

578
01:10:43,631 --> 01:10:45,393
And I also want to make sure members of the board

579
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:49,925
receive the pertinent information for our own determination.

580
01:10:50,445 --> 01:10:56,389
As it stands today, the requested waiver is that entire section of the ordinance be waived.

581
01:10:58,089 --> 01:10:59,930
So perhaps the board will decide to do that.

582
01:11:00,771 --> 01:11:02,872
But I think that info will be helpful to us.

583
01:11:03,933 --> 01:11:11,517
All right, so now that we have that out of the way, Attorney Haverty, you

584
01:11:12,666 --> 01:11:17,090
think it makes sense for us to go through any of these items you called out tonight?

585
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:26,759
Or would you rather just work offline with lawyers for the applicant and see how close we can get on the next iteration?

586
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:30,763
I think it may be better to help to work offline.

587
01:11:30,923 --> 01:11:35,367
I also know that the building commissioner has sent out a couple of emails during the hearing

588
01:11:36,717 --> 01:11:43,302
asking for his ability to provide some feedback on the conditions that impact the building department.

589
01:11:43,983 --> 01:11:55,293
So I think it would be helpful to take it offline and get those corrected and come back to the board with, you know, a new draft that, you know, has everything in order.

590
01:11:56,934 --> 01:11:57,154
Okay.

591
01:11:58,235 --> 01:11:59,737
Sounds good to me.

592
01:12:01,315 --> 01:12:10,620
I just want to check in with members of the board if there's other items they wanted to talk about before we move on to some logistical consideration.

593
01:12:19,845 --> 01:12:20,145
All right.

594
01:12:20,225 --> 01:12:32,011
So as I understand it, the applicant is willing to grant a modest extension to continue this hearing in an effort to resolve some of these open items.

595
01:12:33,312 --> 01:12:42,257
And Dennis, that means we need to identify a date that's far enough into the future

596
01:12:43,622 --> 01:12:54,052
where those discussions can happen and progress and hopefully converge, where we don't lose additional members due to issues of quorum.

597
01:12:54,212 --> 01:13:00,918
So what do you recommend, Dennis?

598
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:07,604
We currently have a regular meeting on the calendar on May 30.

599
01:13:10,029 --> 01:13:19,937
It sounds like we have a bunch to discuss there, so it might not make sense to have meetings there.

600
01:13:19,957 --> 01:13:20,197
Sorry.

601
01:13:21,338 --> 01:13:24,721
Alicia just came in, and I was expecting someone to come through the door, so I got a little startled.

602
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,083
But sorry, apologies for that.

603
01:13:29,504 --> 01:13:35,829
We do have the 28th as a set continuation that we put in the original schedule.

604
01:13:37,451 --> 01:13:37,651
Do we?

605
01:13:37,671 --> 01:13:37,771
Yeah.

606
01:13:40,173 --> 01:13:40,413
Really?

607
01:13:40,453 --> 01:13:40,593
Yeah.

608
01:13:40,613 --> 01:13:45,498
When we did the original one, we had, well, let me double check, but hold on.

609
01:13:46,499 --> 01:13:47,600
I thought that was the date put in.

610
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:50,443
Give me, I wrote the letter.

611
01:13:50,463 --> 01:13:54,767
I'm pretty sure the last date in there was the 21st, but I could be wrong.

612
01:13:55,768 --> 01:13:56,388
I could have sworn.

613
01:13:56,428 --> 01:14:05,677
We talked about having the 28th as a continued date for just in case, like, Hmm.

614
01:14:07,953 --> 01:14:12,854
I don't know why that just, it seemed like, I could have sworn I saw it in a letter or an email.

615
01:14:13,055 --> 01:14:14,915
Maybe I just, I don't know.

616
01:14:15,355 --> 01:14:21,557
So that was, but if nobody else remembers that, then that is not.

617
01:14:23,578 --> 01:14:33,221
Yeah, so the risk with the 28th is that it's right after a holiday weekend.

618
01:14:33,241 --> 01:14:34,261
I know,

619
01:14:35,709 --> 01:14:38,331
The city has reduced hours on Fridays.

620
01:14:38,831 --> 01:14:44,956
So it kind of reduces the turnaround time for this all to converge.

621
01:14:45,036 --> 01:14:45,276
So.

622
01:14:46,297 --> 01:14:50,280
Dennis?

623
01:14:54,143 --> 01:14:54,844
Yeah, Jim.

624
01:14:55,584 --> 01:14:56,965
I did put that in my notes.

625
01:14:57,666 --> 01:15:01,629
And that's what I was alluding to with you, Dennis, that I'll be on duty.

626
01:15:01,649 --> 01:15:02,129
Maybe that was it.

627
01:15:05,415 --> 01:15:07,456
Jim was saying that he was gonna be called up.

628
01:15:07,877 --> 01:15:08,777
He wasn't gonna be available.

629
01:15:08,817 --> 01:15:30,455
Maybe that was the 20 Maybe that was where the 28th came from was from those emails with Jim Yeah So Maybe we can continue this I Think this the safest option is to continue this to the 30th.

630
01:15:30,716 --> 01:15:32,137
I don't know if we have a

631
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:47,450
how many cases we have and what that means for that meeting but it sounds like we have a few I mean that's the only issue is that we have a few that were continued from last month we have a few new ones and then we also have

632
01:15:48,379 --> 01:15:50,700
The other 40 be continued to that when it's sort of a placeholder.

633
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:53,342
That one's not going to hear testimony.

634
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:54,342
That's going to be right.

635
01:15:54,362 --> 01:15:58,384
So staff provides an update and then we choose a new continuation date.

636
01:16:00,285 --> 01:16:00,545
Jim.

637
01:16:00,645 --> 01:16:00,885
Yeah.

638
01:16:01,386 --> 01:16:03,787
I will be out and won't be back.

639
01:16:03,867 --> 01:16:06,448
I thought today that we talked about the 3rd of June.

640
01:16:06,468 --> 01:16:10,931
Yeah, I'm unavailable.

641
01:16:11,451 --> 01:16:17,354
I think it was later than that because I know I'll be away.

642
01:16:18,194 --> 01:16:20,236
And I'll be back on the.

643
01:16:28,281 --> 01:16:29,722
I can do that.

644
01:16:29,782 --> 01:16:35,407
Yeah, otherwise for me.

645
01:16:35,427 --> 01:16:38,629
It would be the following week.

646
01:16:55,549 --> 01:17:08,499
Yeah, so Dennis, my recommendation, we know we have a bunch of members of the board who are already planning to be here on the 30th.

647
01:17:10,341 --> 01:17:12,943
I think we should continue this matter to the 30th.

648
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:14,624
We should come back.

649
01:17:15,184 --> 01:17:16,045
We lose Jim.

650
01:17:16,125 --> 01:17:17,306
We'll still have four.

651
01:17:21,296 --> 01:17:31,699
And then, yeah, we'll be a little suboptimal for the meeting in its totality, but we'll just try to be very efficient in how we use the time.

652
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:43,121
I was starting to say, I think in terms of the recommended changes to the decision itself and the conditions and so on, I think we're really close.

653
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:46,922
So I don't think we'll end up spending a lot of time on that in the meeting.

654
01:17:47,002 --> 01:17:49,703
So it's just really going to be any

655
01:17:51,218 --> 01:18:00,903
any waivers or any conditions that require the boards express input one way or the other, and then this subject of linkage.

656
01:18:00,963 --> 01:18:03,084
And I think we were pretty much settled.

657
01:18:03,184 --> 01:18:05,265
So my recommendation.

658
01:18:05,285 --> 01:18:11,528
The only thing I would say is just for the applicant, because I think I had told him the 28th when I was speaking to him earlier today.

659
01:18:11,568 --> 01:18:16,210
So that's why if I don't know their vision, I don't want to speak for them.

660
01:18:16,230 --> 01:18:18,631
Mr. Chairman.

661
01:18:21,503 --> 01:18:22,444
Dennis's request.

662
01:18:22,584 --> 01:18:26,386
I think the 30th, to your suggestion, makes some sense.

663
01:18:26,466 --> 01:18:33,610
And we can have as many parties to the project team available.

664
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:35,130
And I agree with you.

665
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:43,975
My hope would be that this is a formality at that point, that you've had an opportunity to review a clean draft.

666
01:18:44,055 --> 01:18:48,658
And perhaps there's an issues list of questions for the board's consideration.

667
01:18:51,267 --> 01:18:52,108
OK, wonderful.

668
01:18:52,148 --> 01:18:53,549
Yeah, I think we can do that.

669
01:18:53,669 --> 01:18:57,551
I'll certainly commit to having pre-read the clean draft.

670
01:18:57,931 --> 01:19:02,054
And yeah, we'll just try to be very efficient with our time.

671
01:19:02,114 --> 01:19:03,235
I think we're very close.

672
01:19:03,435 --> 01:19:13,542
This has been a cooperative hearing in general, so I'm not anticipating things dragging out or unexpected issues popping up.

673
01:19:14,482 --> 01:19:15,443
And Mr. Chairman,

674
01:19:16,434 --> 01:19:23,175
We did, I don't want to prolong this discussion this evening, but Pat Noon did prepare a quick summary.

675
01:19:23,416 --> 01:19:29,377
You had asked at the last session what the sort of totality of mitigation might look like.

676
01:19:31,017 --> 01:19:38,999
So we can, if you're interested in hearing that in summary in five minutes or less, we can show you that.

677
01:19:40,639 --> 01:19:43,840
If you're not, we can defer that and just share it with the board.

678
01:19:45,597 --> 01:19:46,577
Thank you for bringing that up.

679
01:19:46,678 --> 01:19:48,518
So that's the unfortunate thing.

680
01:19:48,658 --> 01:19:51,939
I got that before the hearing, but I guess the rest of the board did not.

681
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:53,139
So I've had a chance.

682
01:19:53,159 --> 01:19:53,859
No, that's on me.

683
01:19:53,879 --> 01:19:58,000
So when Alicia emailed it out to you, Mike, I thought it got emailed to everybody in that email.

684
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,121
I sent it to you now.

685
01:20:01,041 --> 01:20:04,742
This is actually a variation of that.

686
01:20:05,122 --> 01:20:08,123
This is essentially a public benefits summary.

687
01:20:08,878 --> 01:20:09,138
Sure.

688
01:20:09,218 --> 01:20:09,939
Yeah, right.

689
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:15,342
So basically, I didn't want to put you on the spot and insist that we discuss that tonight.

690
01:20:15,382 --> 01:20:26,948
But if you think it would be worthwhile to at least summarize the mitigations here tonight, by all means, I think that would be helpful for the board, helpful for the public.

691
01:20:27,691 --> 01:20:39,314
Well, the reason why I'd like to get on the record once more is just to remind the board and the public of the key public benefits, many of which have a direct or indirect cost.

692
01:20:39,954 --> 01:20:51,457
And I think it's important to highlight these before we depart this evening because of the position you've taken on the application of linkage.

693
01:20:52,257 --> 01:20:56,758
Because if linkage were to apply, as I pointed out,

694
01:20:58,348 --> 01:21:09,092
we cannot both provide for effectively a link in addition to the costs associated with it.

695
01:21:09,152 --> 01:21:10,513
So it has to be a compromise.

696
01:21:11,073 --> 01:21:17,155
So with your direction, we can provide just that quick summary?

697
01:21:18,312 --> 01:21:19,733
These aren't controversial views.

698
01:21:19,793 --> 01:21:23,454
It's just a summary of all the different commitments that have been made.

699
01:21:23,474 --> 01:21:27,496
And I would say that this is a fairly conservative estimate.

700
01:21:27,516 --> 01:21:34,479
Pat Noon has not included, I think, a lot of the soft costs that might be associated with these.

701
01:21:35,019 --> 01:21:43,423
But this is just a list of the commitments that we're prepared to undertake absent some surprisingly costly linkage payment.

702
01:21:45,363 --> 01:21:47,204
All right, yes, sounds like a plan.

703
01:21:47,284 --> 01:21:52,086
So Dennis will make host and then we can go through that.

704
01:21:56,348 --> 01:21:58,029
You're all set.

705
01:21:58,189 --> 01:21:58,569
All right.

706
01:22:06,433 --> 01:22:08,314
Can everybody see my screen?

707
01:22:08,975 --> 01:22:10,156
Yes, great.

708
01:22:10,376 --> 01:22:10,716
Thank you.

709
01:22:11,076 --> 01:22:11,316
Thank you.

710
01:22:11,336 --> 01:22:11,816
Mr. Chair.

711
01:22:12,697 --> 01:22:17,078
So, yes, just to expand on Peter summary here.

712
01:22:17,118 --> 01:22:18,359
This was just a quick.

713
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,882
Short 2 slide presentation prepared for tonight to summarize the benefits.

714
01:22:25,002 --> 01:22:28,283
This is actually as Peter referenced a variation of the document.

715
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:36,925
that you received, Mayor, and that I believe is being referenced as being distributed, having been distributed during the hearing with a cost summary.

716
01:22:38,266 --> 01:22:46,948
Before getting into this, to just summarize where we sit with that, having met with Alicia and Danielle and Dennis, members of staff this morning,

717
01:22:48,765 --> 01:22:57,510
One of the outcomes of that meeting was for me to schedule a specific conversation with DPW staff, which I have done.

718
01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:00,511
I do have a conversation with them tomorrow at 2 p.m.

719
01:23:01,032 --> 01:23:06,914
I know that they had some comments on the cost summary, which we will discuss tomorrow.

720
01:23:06,934 --> 01:23:10,576
So I'll be able to get their feedback, take that under consideration.

721
01:23:10,636 --> 01:23:17,640
So that specific cost summary could be a document pending their feedback and information that I get from them.

722
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:22,321
and the productive discussion that we are hopefully able to have.

723
01:23:23,661 --> 01:23:42,905
Diving into this slide, which is more of just an overall summary of project benefits as we see them, as we have gone through the hearing process with the board and with the public, starting with the existing site conditions and just reorienting everybody to what the site looks like now, 100 percent impervious.

724
01:23:43,365 --> 01:23:48,775
lot coverage and building coverage for the majority of the site.

725
01:23:50,997 --> 01:23:58,180
getting into what the site plan looks like with these list of project benefits.

726
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:11,844
I will list them off quickly just to reiterate and review items that have been discussed previously or presented on previously throughout the process of the hearing or items that just generally may

727
01:24:13,565 --> 01:24:20,533
may be considered obvious but restating them for the fact that they are project benefits in our mind.

728
01:24:21,735 --> 01:24:29,684
So starting at the top, creating 73 new units of affordable housing is something that we are

729
01:24:30,385 --> 01:24:38,110
Um, you know, pleased to be able to do as a part of this project and bringing more affordable housing to the city with this site.

730
01:24:38,551 --> 01:24:44,014
And again, in referencing the previous slide with what the existing conditions of the site are.

731
01:24:45,368 --> 01:24:51,494
now proposing to construct new green and landscape areas on this impervious lot.

732
01:24:53,536 --> 01:25:01,263
We think will be an obvious added benefit not only to the site, but to the site conditions relative to stormwater management,

733
01:25:01,907 --> 01:25:06,953
Um, and, uh, overall, um, um, aesthetics of the site.

734
01:25:07,674 --> 01:25:15,943
Um, we are widening Myrtle Street and Emirates Avenue by pulling the curb line inwards, constructing new on street parking and new sidewalks.

735
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:19,908
And, uh, as was referenced during the, um.

736
01:25:21,209 --> 01:25:27,353
uh, review of the draft conditions proposing to grant public parking and sidewalk easements on private property.

737
01:25:29,214 --> 01:25:36,699
A general point as the next bullet is the construction of the off-site I&I requirements, which we coordinated directly with DPW.

738
01:25:38,220 --> 01:25:44,704
and then getting into some of the proposed conditions that we are proposing to take on.

739
01:25:45,485 --> 01:25:54,110
The installation of the rectangular rapid flashing beacon at Myrtle Street and Felsway is something that we will design and pursue with DCR.

740
01:25:55,270 --> 01:26:04,813
as well as the study and the optimization of signal timing at several Fellsway intersections as has been recommended by BETA.

741
01:26:06,434 --> 01:26:14,777
Within city streets under Medford jurisdiction, enhancing pedestrian safety through the curb extensions and closing off of the curb cut

742
01:26:15,357 --> 01:26:33,333
curb cuts at the intersection of Amaranth, Myrtle and Lawrence, a scope that has been discussed and was discussed at the previous hearing as a project benefit that members of the board and the public would like to see, something that we agree with as well.

743
01:26:34,394 --> 01:26:40,540
The complete mill and repaving of Amaranth Avenue as a part of the project scope,

744
01:26:41,661 --> 01:26:55,034
Constructing the publicly accessible landscape walkway, fitness area and playground on the site, which has been discussed and presented on, is a public benefit for the area.

745
01:26:56,315 --> 01:27:03,523
The creation of the future rail trail connection, which was described as a part of the review of the draft conditions

746
01:27:04,303 --> 01:27:16,370
how that would be handled in that document, but in general, as is depicted on the site plan here, something that we would coordinate with the city on how to make that accessible when the rail trail itself is completed.

747
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:33,299
The replacing of the existing MBTA bus shelter in coordination with the MBTA to install a new shelter that has been, as has been previously discussed, is more amenitized than the existing shelter and can accommodate

748
01:27:34,019 --> 01:27:37,201
more passengers or potential passengers.

749
01:27:39,362 --> 01:27:48,126
The next item in coordination with Lyft and the city, the installation of a new blue bike station.

750
01:27:48,827 --> 01:27:54,870
We have shown in previous plans and presentations where we have proposed this to go.

751
01:27:54,890 --> 01:28:01,413
I have personally previewed the proposed locations with members of Lyft staff.

752
01:28:02,094 --> 01:28:09,529
that I have coordinated previous Blue Bike installations with and have gotten conceptual buy-in from them.

753
01:28:11,450 --> 01:28:15,252
certainly proposing to to design and pursue that as a part of the project.

754
01:28:15,712 --> 01:28:37,903
And then lastly, to the creation of new opportunities for public artwork on the site, which is something that, as was mentioned in the draft conditions that we would coordinate with the city with the Arts Council and preview with the board before installing, but certainly something that we can be

755
01:28:38,937 --> 01:28:46,785
strong in our effort to pursue and bring those public art elements into the site as a part of the construction of the project.

756
01:28:46,825 --> 01:28:54,633
So, as Peter mentioned, just to close this out, I just wanted to reiterate and remind everyone

757
01:28:55,133 --> 01:29:08,795
As a summary, as we've come to the end of the hearing process, that these are the project benefits that we believe we are bringing as a part of the creation and construction of this development.

758
01:29:11,378 --> 01:29:26,432
These are the two slides, as Attorney Tam mentioned, keeping it very brief, but just trying to leave everybody with this graphic and this understanding of our view of the project benefits.

759
01:29:28,234 --> 01:29:28,574
Thank you.

760
01:29:32,987 --> 01:29:38,232
Yeah, and I just want to say there are a lot of benefits included in this project.

761
01:29:38,913 --> 01:29:41,535
As a member of the board, I appreciate this.

762
01:29:41,655 --> 01:29:47,001
And so I look forward to hearing updates from the discussions with the city.

763
01:29:47,021 --> 01:29:49,743
I think, as a member of the board, what I'm

764
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:54,623
going to want to know is kind of wherever you land.

765
01:29:54,763 --> 01:30:07,754
And then also, you know, the board, its analysis is going to involve which of these benefits are mitigations that are

766
01:30:09,675 --> 01:30:19,179
on-site versus off-site, you know, necessary to accommodate the project versus kind of more goodwill opt-in.

767
01:30:19,399 --> 01:30:28,483
So there's a number of things here that are completely off the project site improvements that are going to clearly benefit the city.

768
01:30:28,763 --> 01:30:36,047
And so I certainly think there are items here that will, you know, the city will be amenable to include in that list.

769
01:30:36,147 --> 01:30:39,308
So, yeah, I look forward to hearing updates from those discussions.

770
01:30:44,044 --> 01:30:46,265
All right.

771
01:30:47,065 --> 01:30:48,126
I'll check in with the board.

772
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:56,450
Does any member of the board have questions or comments on the presentation we just received?

773
01:31:04,374 --> 01:31:04,694
All right.

774
01:31:05,914 --> 01:31:08,316
Let's move on to logistics then.

775
01:31:08,336 --> 01:31:09,916
So I think we settled it.

776
01:31:10,577 --> 01:31:12,798
The intention is to continue this to the 30th, right?

777
01:31:15,643 --> 01:31:15,903
Okay.

778
01:31:16,463 --> 01:31:23,325
Chair awaits a motion to continue this matter to May 30th at 6.30 p.m.

779
01:31:23,345 --> 01:31:26,546
Do I have a second?

780
01:31:28,306 --> 01:31:28,627
Second.

781
01:31:28,647 --> 01:31:29,567
All right.

782
01:31:29,607 --> 01:31:30,887
We'll take a roll call.

783
01:31:30,907 --> 01:31:31,667
Yvette?

784
01:31:32,768 --> 01:31:32,888
Aye.

785
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:34,028
Jim?

786
01:31:34,848 --> 01:31:34,948
Aye.

787
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:36,389
Andre?

788
01:31:36,409 --> 01:31:37,089
Aye.

789
01:31:37,949 --> 01:31:38,209
Mike?

790
01:31:38,649 --> 01:31:38,789
Aye.

791
01:31:39,729 --> 01:31:40,050
All right.

792
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:41,790
This matter is now continued.

793
01:31:41,810 --> 01:31:43,130
So thank you, folks.

794
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:44,811
We will see you on the 30th.

795
01:31:46,445 --> 01:31:47,265
Thank you, Mr. Chair.

796
01:31:48,306 --> 01:31:48,686
Thank you.

797
01:31:51,008 --> 01:31:52,368
And Mike, we need to stay on, right?

798
01:31:52,929 --> 01:31:53,929
We need to stay on.

799
01:31:53,949 --> 01:31:57,652
Yeah, there's a couple of administrative items on the agenda.

800
01:32:03,415 --> 01:32:04,215
What's next, Dennis?

801
01:32:07,217 --> 01:32:08,938
You're on mute.

802
01:32:09,739 --> 01:32:09,899
Yep.

803
01:32:09,939 --> 01:32:10,239
So yeah.

804
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:16,262
And then send out a message that we're meeting tomorrow with DPW and engineering.

805
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:19,044
So hopefully that'll sort out a lot of what your concerns were.

806
01:32:19,064 --> 01:32:21,505
And when I get the results from that, I'll let you all know.

807
01:32:24,446 --> 01:32:28,909
And I think that's really probably it in terms of administrative stuff.

808
01:32:28,929 --> 01:32:33,511
The only other thing is I do get meeting minutes from Rachel, but I realized I didn't send them out.

809
01:32:33,651 --> 01:32:36,053
So I got them like yesterday or earlier today.

810
01:32:36,073 --> 01:32:36,113
So.

811
01:32:37,116 --> 01:32:42,159
Apologies to Rachel for that, but she did work hard and turning around and but we're meeting next week.

812
01:32:42,179 --> 01:32:46,041
So we can have them for that meeting and I'll, but I'll get them to.

813
01:32:47,422 --> 01:32:49,743
Jamie as well as a recording of the meeting, so you can.

814
01:32:49,763 --> 01:32:51,004
Review.

815
01:32:52,245 --> 01:32:53,726
Okay, sound next week.

816
01:32:54,986 --> 01:32:55,427
Thank you.

817
01:32:55,447 --> 01:32:58,328
Yeah, and thank you Rachel.

818
01:32:58,649 --> 01:33:00,229
I've really enjoyed the meeting minutes.

819
01:33:00,249 --> 01:33:00,650
They've been good.

820
01:33:01,643 --> 01:33:03,865
Um, so, okay.

821
01:33:04,205 --> 01:33:06,907
Uh, I think that's the last item on the agenda.

822
01:33:06,987 --> 01:33:08,788
Chair awaits a motion to adjourn.

823
01:33:13,371 --> 01:33:17,534
The motion to adjourn for the second second.

824
01:33:17,554 --> 01:33:18,395
All right.

825
01:33:18,415 --> 01:33:19,575
We'll take a roll call.

826
01:33:19,776 --> 01:33:20,276
Andre.

827
01:33:20,296 --> 01:33:22,317
Hi, Gary.

828
01:33:28,962 --> 01:33:29,282
Jim.

829
01:33:30,263 --> 01:33:30,323
Hi.

830
01:33:31,748 --> 01:33:40,335
It will go back to Mary I. That I like I. All right, we are adjourned.

831
01:33:40,675 --> 01:33:42,197
Thanks.

832
01:33:42,257 --> 01:33:42,857
Have a good night.
