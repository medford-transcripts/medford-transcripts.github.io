1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:05,570
[SPEAKER_07]: actions or on the questions that, um, how opposed comes to present bears.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:05,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, vice president Collins.

4
00:00:07,691 --> 00:00:11,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think, um, in this case, we should, I think, try to keep it simple.

5
00:00:12,052 --> 00:00:16,353
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not, uh, Seattle, you know, we're not a city of that scale.

6
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:23,615
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just think we should reflect the capacity of our staff and also the, you know, sometimes we're not working with,

7
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:31,643
[SPEAKER_06]: giant, I don't think we, I don't even want to implement a policy that is too much for some of the smaller folks who might want to be developing something here.

8
00:00:31,803 --> 00:00:42,106
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, I think we should err on the size of user friendliness while also maintaining, uh, green priorities, but I could see how we could go down a rabbit hole pretty quick.

9
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:49,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that I've talked about is, you know, instead of having it be a score between zero and one, let's do between zero and a hundred.

10
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:51,128
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people really understand that scale.

11
00:00:51,741 --> 00:01:02,751
[SPEAKER_06]: All you have to do is multiply everything by 100 anyway, so it doesn't really change the substance of it, but just trying to make it a little more comprehensible to the average person, I think, is something we should consider here as well.

12
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:03,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

13
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:08,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Beres.

14
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:18,685
[SPEAKER_07]: For myself, I agree, I think that

15
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:35,234
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a less is more situation, especially when we consider that any sort of green score that we do apply is a big improvement in terms of the new features and benefits that will get from that over what we currently have, which is you know we don't have this type of worksheet we don't have these types of

16
00:01:37,797 --> 00:01:39,038
[SPEAKER_07]: regulations right now.

17
00:01:39,638 --> 00:01:51,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that the most important, my number one priority is kind of making sure that we are crystal clear on what goes on to that worksheet, what are the goals and the priorities that we're formulating the rubric around.

18
00:01:55,306 --> 00:01:59,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, I think that we could have, there's certainly a lot of rabbit holes to get into, especially we

19
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:08,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure we could have a very fun conversation about exactly what types of plants and trees we'd like to see in different districts around the city.

20
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,670
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm going, you know, as one counselor, I think I'll challenge myself to take this big picture.

21
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:26,654
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be curious to hear from city staff on that question of if we're, you know, if we're trying to pick three major topics that we want to organize the rubric around, whether it's heat mitigation,

22
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:35,084
[SPEAKER_07]: functional landscapes or another feature on the question of, you know, capacity for managing this policy.

23
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:37,947
[SPEAKER_07]: How much do we think that we can fit on the menu?

24
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:41,211
[SPEAKER_07]: What feels like the most important thing to have on it in terms of goals?

25
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:48,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully this thing is on.

26
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:49,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Building Commissioner Scott.

27
00:02:50,848 --> 00:03:01,859
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just asking if this is being done in concert with the engineering department, which already has stormwater retention regulations in place that affect new properties and existing properties.

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,863
[SPEAKER_05]: And the trigger is 200 square feet of new impervious area, so a deck.

29
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:12,282
[SPEAKER_05]: or a sidewalk can trigger their requirements, which involve engineers and other stuff.

30
00:03:12,302 --> 00:03:16,203
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would hate to see these two clash with each other when it's all done.

31
00:03:16,223 --> 00:03:19,183
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something we've been doing for a period of time now.

32
00:03:24,784 --> 00:03:27,045
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think that that was something I wanted to bring up too.

33
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:34,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I think how this interfaces with the stormwater work and also the potential tree ordinance, you know, those are gonna be two questions.

34
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:45,904
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there was a discussion where some of the green scores leave the stormwater element out of it, since stormwater regulations are handling that separately.

35
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:48,225
[SPEAKER_06]: And that might be the road we want to go down here.

36
00:03:48,245 --> 00:04:01,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I've seen usually this complements the stormwater management.

37
00:04:07,108 --> 00:04:17,652
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I think it's in Somerville, they have an urban forestry department, and they will be in charge of decisions that will be in here.

38
00:04:20,414 --> 00:04:21,894
[SPEAKER_00]: This only affects the

39
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:30,254
[SPEAKER_00]: this is only applying into the lot, the private lot, so nothing about the right of way.

40
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:37,038
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is only, and it only takes into account the private lot.

41
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,681
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually this is regulated by the Department of Public Works.

42
00:04:44,272 --> 00:05:01,935
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something that this, whenever we go through the language, that it's something that of course we need to take into account and we need to see in the language how we should do this and obviously take into account the stormwater regulation to see that we are not doubling anything.

43
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:06,496
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we will take this into account, absolutely.

44
00:05:06,736 --> 00:05:10,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever we start with a draft, we can get more into detail.

45
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you, I'll recognize Planner Evans.

46
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:23,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner.

47
00:05:24,103 --> 00:05:26,184
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to kind of piggyback on that.

48
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:45,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an expert in the stormwater regulations and how you can comply with the stormwater permits, but I believe that a green score would have more kind of things that would

49
00:05:47,208 --> 00:06:06,733
[SPEAKER_01]: help with urban heat island effect and just overall greening, whereas the stormwater permit could be satisfied, I think, with systems and things that are below the surface that don't necessarily cool or sequester carbon dioxide, things like that.

50
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:14,415
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe this could be a way to incentivize achieving some of those goals through

51
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:20,570
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, bioswales, you know, versus, you know, underground retention system.

52
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:31,957
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as what this could apply to, I feel like anything that would trigger site plan review could be subject to a minimum green score.

53
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:34,338
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be manageable from our office.

54
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:42,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would make it easier if there was, you know, a calculation, like a metric to,

55
00:06:45,586 --> 00:07:04,639
[SPEAKER_01]: see if, because we have performance standards, but they're kind of subjective and it's kind of wishy-washy, whereas having a score that we could calculate from a menu of options, I think would be easier for when we're reviewing to make sure that it actually complies in some way.

56
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:12,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Because each site is unique and some things won't work on some lots that would work in other places.

57
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:18,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Daniel.

58
00:07:18,723 --> 00:07:19,324
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate that.

59
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:23,626
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hearing that in terms of capacity and making this doable.

60
00:07:24,506 --> 00:07:39,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Apart from, let me know if I'm mishearing you, apart from the rubric of the green score itself, having a metric that just quantitatively says if a property, if a site is subject to green score or not would also be helpful so that that's not

61
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:45,235
[SPEAKER_07]: getting into the more arbitrary using your best judgment side of things, which would add another layer.

62
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:45,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

63
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:48,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, just making it super clear.

64
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:51,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that makes sense.

65
00:07:51,477 --> 00:08:07,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that if we are, I think that it'll be important to have a very, very clear user-friendly

66
00:08:08,542 --> 00:08:15,649
[SPEAKER_07]: frame around what properties are subject to this and which are not, if we're getting into, you know, drawing lines around.

67
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:29,382
[SPEAKER_07]: If this is to be not a universal policy, which it seems like, Paul, please correct me if I'm wrong, in all the cities that you gave example from, it sounded like it was

68
00:08:30,836 --> 00:08:37,902
[SPEAKER_07]: targeted at larger developments and that size threshold was different based on district and building usage.

69
00:08:37,962 --> 00:08:38,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

70
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:49,411
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Kit, I lost you for a second.

71
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:50,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you asking me something?

72
00:08:53,533 --> 00:09:05,406
[SPEAKER_07]: In the examples that you reviewed, it's true that in each case, green score only kicks in for buildings over a certain size threshold, but that size threshold is different depending on the zoning district.

73
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:09,423
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it now.

74
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:13,845
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on the decision of the city.

75
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:25,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Somerville applies to any new building, it doesn't matter where it is, only special districts are exempt, but for the rest it applies to

76
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,813
[SPEAKER_00]: every building, residential, commercial, any size.

77
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:43,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Seattle and Washington, because they ask a bit more, they only apply it to the buildings that actually have a bigger impact in heat island effect, for example, so higher density.

78
00:09:44,707 --> 00:10:02,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington has a threshold of square footage so they apply the minimum to after a certain they apply a green score after a certain square footage and for Seattle it's not applied in residential

79
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:10,234
[SPEAKER_00]: also not in Washington, also never residential, from one to four units.

80
00:10:10,854 --> 00:10:14,858
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it's multifamily, more or less, I would need to check better.

81
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:21,083
[SPEAKER_00]: But mainly low density residential, they do not have to go through green score.

82
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you.

83
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:53,399
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think for myself, again, trying to thread that needle in between pie in the sky, let's use this mechanism to, you know, robustly elicit more of the things that we know we want to see in our city between we have the staff that we have and let's make this a policy that we can really put into action and make sure that this is manageable for, you know, developers of all sizes in Medford.

84
00:10:55,819 --> 00:11:18,673
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I'm inclined to have green score focus on, you know, greening our urban landscape here in Medford focused on functional landscapes that bringing more diversity to the green spaces that we do have on our lots apart from just lawns which don't improve the environment as well as some other options as well as, I think, mitigating the urban heat island effect is really important and some of those.

85
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:24,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Greening the landscape options are, of course, you know, rhyme very well with that goal.

86
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:35,352
[SPEAKER_07]: When it comes to how far should this extend, where should this kick in, and how ambitious should we be, I'm kind of of two minds.

87
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:37,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that

88
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:46,870
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we can look at what's simple to implement and then think about like the consequences to city staff and the consequences on, you know, smaller scale developers.

89
00:11:49,070 --> 00:12:01,894
[SPEAKER_07]: It's interesting to note that in some of all the supplies to all districts and to note that smaller scale development, you know, those small development projects are still going on at the same time.

90
00:12:01,914 --> 00:12:06,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that there's also an argument to be made for this having kick in

91
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:11,756
[SPEAKER_07]: concurrent with site plan review, especially if we're hearing from planning staff that that's what's doable.

92
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:18,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Though I do like the idea of expanding this to all new development in the city.

93
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:29,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that might have to be paired with maybe for a small development, you only have to reach like 50%, for example, whereas for a big commercial development, we'd want them to get all the way to 100.

94
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,501
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we need to think through how to change the score

95
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:39,153
[SPEAKER_07]: depending on the size of the development without making it confusing or onerous.

96
00:12:40,954 --> 00:13:03,842
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious to hear from my fellow counselors if we have general agreement on at least the goals of functional greening and heat island effect and to kind of try to reach a decision about how far this should, how maximally this should apply to districts and developments in Medford.

97
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:21,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other considerations from our fellow councillors at this time on this topic?

98
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:24,582
[SPEAKER_07]: President Bares?

99
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:30,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Just given what we've discussed, I think site plan review makes a lot of sense, and I think we should move in that direction as a threshold.

100
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:31,707
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

101
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,911
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm hearing consensus around prioritizing.

102
00:13:37,931 --> 00:13:40,293
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Callahan, go ahead.

103
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,454
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to chime in.

104
00:13:42,534 --> 00:13:43,195
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally agree.

105
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:47,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important to be involved, and I'm excited for it.

106
00:13:53,305 --> 00:13:54,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you, Councilor Callahan.

107
00:13:56,348 --> 00:13:57,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I caught that, were other people able to?

108
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay, great.

109
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:02,235
[SPEAKER_07]: We got you, Councilor Callahan, yeah.

110
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:05,533
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, great.

111
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:08,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Paola, thank you so much for this overview.

112
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:18,621
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really excited to work together on a policy that focuses on mitigating urban heat island effect, functional greening of the landscapes that runs concurrent with site plan review.

113
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:25,584
[SPEAKER_07]: In terms of next steps, I am curious, what does a green score policy look like on the city council side?

114
00:14:25,704 --> 00:14:31,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this a matter of just putting enabling legislation into our code of ordinances and then like the planning department

115
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:37,014
[SPEAKER_07]: develops the rubric based on our priorities or do we get into that level of specificity.

116
00:14:39,157 --> 00:14:42,061
[SPEAKER_07]: In a language proposal on as part of this process.

117
00:14:58,424 --> 00:14:59,444
[SPEAKER_07]: Paula, sorry, that was to you.

118
00:14:59,885 --> 00:15:02,786
[SPEAKER_07]: What can we expect in terms of... Sorry.

119
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:04,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sure.

120
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:19,593
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that we would like to review about this new threshold and start preparing some language so you can already see it in more of a zoning, how it will be applied in the zoning.

121
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:22,436
[SPEAKER_00]: and what are the different documents that we can provide.

122
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:36,153
[SPEAKER_00]: We also want to talk with the city to see if they can help us to get the list of plans, to get a bit of the documentation that goes around it.

123
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:51,574
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Alicia mentioned to us that that was a possibility, and that they will be willing to give us, for example, the list for native and adaptive plants that will be interesting to use in Medford.

124
00:15:53,536 --> 00:16:14,849
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will just go ahead, give maybe several proposals, give different options on when those thresholds appear, and what type of scoring we will be doing, and start to preparing some standards, the element standards, so that we can review it with you.

125
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:17,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great, thank you so much.

126
00:16:19,264 --> 00:16:20,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate that, look forward to next steps.

127
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:25,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand our next topic on the agenda is, would that be incentive zoning?

128
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:26,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

129
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:34,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, I believe we have public participation on this item, so just quickly before we go on, Gaston, if you'd like to be recognized, you have three minutes.

130
00:16:36,206 --> 00:16:37,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

131
00:16:38,027 --> 00:16:42,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had a question given that this is also called a cool score.

132
00:16:42,909 --> 00:17:01,599
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately I have to replace the roof in my house and I did a lot of research on roofs and I was interested in using cool shingles, meaning shingles that have solar reflecting granules, which are for example, mandatory in California or at least some areas of California.

133
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:05,321
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're not available in the Northeast, unfortunately.

134
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:10,625
[SPEAKER_04]: The same manufacturer, they just divide the country in regions and they don't make them available here.

135
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:29,738
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just wondering whether it would make sense to try to incentivize, maybe not small houses like mine, but commercial development to use solar reflecting paint, for example, in flat rooms, or even in bigger developments

136
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:52,045
[SPEAKER_04]: um that uh something like uh singles that again are readily available in other parts of the country thank you so uh yeah so the cool score for example that's something that cambridge uses and uh that um

137
00:17:53,832 --> 00:18:05,538
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way incentivize the use of materials with, I think it's a lower solar reflect, a higher, yeah, so a higher reflective index.

138
00:18:06,138 --> 00:18:15,983
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the topic that I was talking about that it is a bit, there is a lot of controversy around this.

139
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:41,500
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is on the studies that have been made, all the variables that are being taken into account, for something like roofs to prevent heating, so to prevent that the heat goes into the building, having a reflective material, so with a lighter color, it would make sense.

140
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:50,139
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is always a lot better is going to be to have green.

141
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,504
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of not only that part of

142
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,111
[SPEAKER_00]: with the soil, and it's a lot more isolated, with water, it's a lot more isolated.

143
00:19:05,172 --> 00:19:14,494
[SPEAKER_00]: So the incentivize for certain projects, and that's why maybe residential, we are not taking into account, it's because it's going to be a bit more costly.

144
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:24,797
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to have a green roof, that will be the best, to have green or blue roof so that it can also accumulate water.

145
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:33,884
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it's bad, but I don't have still a lot of the information.

146
00:19:34,024 --> 00:19:44,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So to say that it's very, very efficient, I think other things are more efficient because they don't take into account the porosity of the material, for example.

147
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:53,410
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't take into account many other variables that also play a very important part on the absorption of heat.

148
00:19:55,552 --> 00:20:10,652
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better, for example, gravel, even if it's darker or with a lower radiation, than white concrete, because of the compact capacity of the material, etc.

149
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:11,913
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no ventilation.

150
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:16,616
[SPEAKER_00]: No place for water that it can refresh the material.

151
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:26,219
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of things I think it's very technical and to incentivize I don't know how effective it is, as I said before, in exactly the same.

152
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,221
[SPEAKER_00]: going for a lighter material or with a higher solar reflective.

153
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's great.

154
00:20:36,281 --> 00:20:43,743
[SPEAKER_00]: But maybe what we want to do here with also stormwater collection, I don't think that is the best incentive to use.

155
00:20:44,383 --> 00:20:48,103
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answered your, but I can get a bit more information on the matter.

156
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:56,885
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to, so I will look a bit more into it and see if that has that type of element should go into the green score.

157
00:20:58,617 --> 00:20:59,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Paola.

158
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,022
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's get on to incentive zoning.

159
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:04,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

160
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:05,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

161
00:21:23,397 --> 00:21:23,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

162
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:32,888
[SPEAKER_00]: So incentive zoning is going to be a bit similar to green score in the method that we use.

163
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:35,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it doesn't have to, but it can be very similar.

164
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:40,631
[SPEAKER_00]: So it provides a menu of options that we can choose from.

165
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:42,171
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the part that is similar.

166
00:21:43,731 --> 00:21:46,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Incentive zoning is not going to be mandatory.

167
00:21:46,132 --> 00:21:49,533
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very much voluntary program.

168
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:55,255
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea is to mainly negotiate with the developers

169
00:21:56,047 --> 00:22:03,612
[SPEAKER_00]: that in order to let them build extra floor area, the community gets amenities in exchange.

170
00:22:04,953 --> 00:22:11,197
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that we have certain dimension standards for every district.

171
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:21,785
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say that these maximums can be altered through this incentive zoning if

172
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:28,022
[SPEAKER_00]: the community gets certain bonus from it, certain benefits.

173
00:22:30,324 --> 00:22:45,677
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually only applied to certain areas, to certain districts, usually with higher density so that it's easier to build higher and more or floor area.

174
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:51,366
[SPEAKER_00]: And the requirements can be very site-specific.

175
00:22:51,947 --> 00:23:01,393
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be that certain, a corridor, for example, is going to be different than, or it can go neighbourhood by neighbourhood better.

176
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:04,435
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on what the neighbourhood needs.

177
00:23:05,395 --> 00:23:09,618
[SPEAKER_00]: The requirements of the incentive zoning are going to change.

178
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:14,491
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we have for developers?

179
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:27,585
[SPEAKER_00]: So for developers, they will get, it can be density bonus, this is the most usual one, fee waivers or exemptions, parking reductions or expedite permitting.

180
00:23:27,826 --> 00:23:34,273
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things that we're going to focus today on the density bonus, but just to know that these are also possibilities.

181
00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:37,190
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is getting the city?

182
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:39,552
[SPEAKER_00]: They get more affordable housing.

183
00:23:40,012 --> 00:23:49,958
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the green score can be ideal, or you can have a better building score in terms of sustainability.

184
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:53,640
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have underground or cover parking.

185
00:23:54,181 --> 00:24:03,046
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have public amenities on site, or you can have that they pay, they contribute into a fund

186
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:05,985
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to be used for a community project.

187
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:12,229
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the things that we will negotiate, right?

188
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:29,938
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in zones where the incentive zoning is going to be available, we have this kind of a base and a maximum building coverage or a base and a maximum high limit.

189
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:30,659
[SPEAKER_00]: This means

190
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:34,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever I have by right is going to be my base.

191
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:41,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever I can do and whatever I can get through incentives zoning is going to be my maximum.

192
00:24:44,553 --> 00:24:47,334
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the different methods that we have?

193
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:54,757
[SPEAKER_00]: So many cities around are applying incentives zoning in thousands of different ways.

194
00:24:56,005 --> 00:25:05,591
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just putting two so that we can, and what I'm going to, what I want to hear from you is what, how do we do this?

195
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,913
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the one we would like to have?

196
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:11,014
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are these two different methods.

197
00:25:11,114 --> 00:25:13,296
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just sharing one in the city of Portland.

198
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:18,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you see is this base height that we were talking about, this pre-bonus height.

199
00:25:20,203 --> 00:25:22,825
[SPEAKER_00]: They only allow it in three districts.

200
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:28,491
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only in very specific, for example, in one of them, it's only one street.

201
00:25:29,877 --> 00:25:34,859
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have the pre-bonus height, which is four, six, and four stories.

202
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:42,341
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have these different benefits that they want to have.

203
00:25:42,961 --> 00:25:50,363
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a mid-block permeability, for example, a residential density, a green roof, or affordable housing.

204
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:55,225
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on where you are, some is not applicable and some are.

205
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:58,626
[SPEAKER_00]: and then all of them will give you one story.

206
00:25:59,146 --> 00:26:18,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you give mid-block permeability, this is basically that they have the lot in between two streets, two public streets, and they open it to passages to public so that they can cross from one street to the other through their building.

207
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,650
[SPEAKER_00]: And so

208
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,247
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of these has obviously certain standards.

209
00:26:24,487 --> 00:26:44,840
[SPEAKER_00]: So the green roof is not going to be just a very minimum green roof, but I guess they have a standards where it's going to be at least a minimum of thickness of soil so that they have a good absorbing, a lot of storing water, certain, I guess it's more about an intensive green roof.

210
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,342
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the affordable housing, which is,

211
00:26:47,922 --> 00:26:57,185
[SPEAKER_00]: not the affordable housing that the city is already requiring, but a big percentage over that minimum required.

212
00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:01,827
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with each one of this, you get one story.

213
00:27:02,207 --> 00:27:07,869
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the kind of the simplest way that we can have this.

214
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:15,812
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a few of them, not a lot, and then you get one story for this, each one of those.

215
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:25,367
[SPEAKER_00]: The maximum that you can have, so the height with bonus, the maximum per sub-district, is just going to be one more.

216
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:37,738
[SPEAKER_00]: So they only permit that you do one story up, and you can choose why there is going to be the mid-block, the residential, the green roof, or the affordable housing.

217
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:44,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the site, depending on the economical feasibility of it, you're going to choose one or the other.

218
00:27:45,256 --> 00:27:53,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have that bonus floor has to follow a certain step back, and in here is the 15 feet.

219
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:57,522
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one way that a lot of the cities do it.

220
00:27:57,942 --> 00:28:12,710
[SPEAKER_00]: They just give very minimum selection of elements, very much citywide in the sense that it's, well, unless it's the non-applicable for some reason, maybe because they don't have this

221
00:28:13,445 --> 00:28:18,690
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements, maybe because they have a lot of green in that area, so they don't need so much the green roof.

222
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really need the affordable housing.

223
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:29,380
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they just, you can only get it if you do affordable housing, because that's the only thing that we are interested in incentivizing in that district.

224
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:34,905
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one method, one way of doing it.

225
00:28:36,354 --> 00:28:47,022
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is, for example, a bit more complex in the sense that this is more like the green score system where you have some points.

226
00:28:47,803 --> 00:28:53,527
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to build one floor, you need to reach a certain amount of points.

227
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:56,910
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have more the citywide kind of things.

228
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:03,835
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, it was rent reduction, then delete silver or any kind of sustainability for building.

229
00:29:04,634 --> 00:29:26,383
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are the amenities, indoor or outdoor pedestrian, that whenever it's amenities in place, the maintenance will have to be done by the owner of the building, not by the city.

230
00:29:26,703 --> 00:29:31,305
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we propose a plaza, that plaza has to be taken care

231
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:34,598
[SPEAKER_00]: by the owner of that building, of that development.

232
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:51,407
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a range of different amenities that we can get, different points that you can sum and then whenever you get to 15 points and you can have from two stories to three and a half,

233
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:57,436
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum floor area can be increased from 0.7 to 1.1, etc.

234
00:29:57,576 --> 00:30:05,402
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different things that you can get from benefits that you can get if the 15 are reached or 20 are achieved.

235
00:30:05,963 --> 00:30:07,664
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the other way.

236
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:15,050
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we compare these two different methods, the City of Portland would be more simple.

237
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:18,293
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much that they have two or three needs,

238
00:30:19,534 --> 00:30:20,076
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.

239
00:30:20,337 --> 00:30:22,887
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to make sure that they incentivize only those.

240
00:30:25,148 --> 00:30:32,672
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one, it depends on the area, and it is a lot more flexible, and it could be a lot more adaptable by district.

241
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:49,601
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for example, if we have a neighborhood where we need a lot more green because it's very compact, and the city is not, there is not a lot of space in the public realm to do it, a way of incentivizing it is through incentive zoning.

242
00:30:50,302 --> 00:31:03,756
[SPEAKER_00]: and to have these amenities and incentivize or give more points to the green areas, for example, and even in other areas you do have a lot of green and that's not your

243
00:31:04,246 --> 00:31:20,501
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want to achieve, then the points that we're going to have for green areas, when you don't need it, it's going to be lower, and you have a lot of need for affordable housing, then you increase those.

244
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:23,619
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the two ways.

245
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:32,186
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a bit more complex, but that gives it a lot more flexibility, and that gives us that it can be a lot more adaptable by the district needs.

246
00:31:32,646 --> 00:31:35,969
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is more simple, but it doesn't mean that it's worse.

247
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:45,917
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that depending on the needs, if we really know that we have two things that we really need to get, and this is a way of incentivizing, maybe that's

248
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:56,346
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't want to go very high, you don't want to give a lot of stories or to densify a lot, then that will be maybe your better choice.

249
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:02,011
[SPEAKER_00]: So until here, I'm going to stop sharing so that any

250
00:32:08,248 --> 00:32:23,173
[SPEAKER_00]: any comments, anything that will help us as well to start building a language and to start, if it's something that we want, which, for example, I would see working very well in Mystic Avenue, for example.

251
00:32:25,015 --> 00:32:26,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Paola.

252
00:32:27,157 --> 00:32:30,419
[SPEAKER_07]: On the last question, yes, we should do incentive zoning.

253
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:36,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a very well-suited for Mystic Valley Corridor and other areas of the city.

254
00:32:36,483 --> 00:32:43,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Just quickly before I recognize Councillor Lemming, just for my notes, was that example from Portland, Maine or Portland, Oregon?

255
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's here, Massachusetts.

256
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:51,613
[SPEAKER_00]: I can check very quickly.

257
00:32:51,974 --> 00:32:52,214
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

258
00:32:53,168 --> 00:32:53,828
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's okay.

259
00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:55,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably main then.

260
00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:56,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lemming, go ahead.

261
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,592
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for the presentation, Paola.

262
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:12,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question I have is that we have a couple of programs that are proposed on our wish list, which sort of relate to zoning incentives.

263
00:33:12,578 --> 00:33:18,261
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been pushing for the transportation demand management program to be implemented in

264
00:33:18,968 --> 00:33:23,610
[SPEAKER_03]: some forms that we could get developers more involved in the regional TMAs.

265
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:40,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also, but there's also other aspects to this, like an inclusion, like affordable housing overlays and a few other programs that could affect, that could affect a developer's decision to build,

266
00:33:42,578 --> 00:33:45,759
[SPEAKER_03]: to build housing, like the linkage program they were discussing last night.

267
00:33:45,779 --> 00:34:07,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my question is, in the other cities that you've been studying, do they normally have a bunch of different incentive programs overlaid with each other that are integrated, or is it normally better to keep it more or less simple?

268
00:34:10,444 --> 00:34:11,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's a great question.

269
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:13,885
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends on the city.

270
00:34:14,005 --> 00:34:16,306
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen many, many different ways.

271
00:34:17,546 --> 00:34:32,610
[SPEAKER_00]: The usual is where they have less things and bigger cities that usually don't have problems on developers being able to develop.

272
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:37,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that in any case, you will have developers because the market is

273
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:50,862
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more demanding, they will be a lot more complex and they will be a lot more, they will make a lot more requirements.

274
00:34:50,882 --> 00:35:01,312
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, I've seen that, I think it was in Seattle, where they asked for transportation management in the incentive zoning.

275
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:06,697
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do that, you have to be part of the transportation demand management.

276
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:16,654
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends on the cities, because a lot of the cities have the need for affordable housing.

277
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:20,278
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them use it for getting more affordable housing.

278
00:35:20,839 --> 00:35:29,702
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really depends on the goal of the city to make it more simple, more complex, and depends on the need.

279
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:42,307
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the idea of the amenities and to be more on neighborhood based, because then you can really make a difference from different neighborhoods and ask for whatever they really need.

280
00:35:42,947 --> 00:36:00,485
[SPEAKER_00]: and so not only go for the affordable but maybe in neighborhoods that you already have some affordable and that is not your priority and maybe the public realm starts to be the really neat because there is no space, there is no

281
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:13,678
[SPEAKER_00]: area that is very, I don't know, that there has a quality public space, then I will try to go for a more point based because there are a lot of different needs in the city.

282
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:22,547
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that really we should look into that we can start working with you and to get your opinions.

283
00:36:23,363 --> 00:36:34,474
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we really want to get the more complete and better, whatever fits this city the best.

284
00:36:34,534 --> 00:36:36,556
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that there is one that is better than the other.

285
00:36:36,717 --> 00:36:38,058
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the city's need.

286
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:39,860
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be what I wanted to say.

287
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:47,802
[SPEAKER_03]: personally speaking, my end all be all is Medford does need more affordable housing.

288
00:36:47,882 --> 00:37:06,466
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever our zoning can do to disincentivize developers from building luxury units and to integrate more affordable housing and to make that more profitable for them would be ideal and whatever the best mechanism to do that is, I would support.

289
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:10,167
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also, though, like programs that

290
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:22,058
[SPEAKER_03]: incentivize developers who come into Medford to sort of be more integrated into what's happening in the surrounding communities, just so that we're not so isolated.

291
00:37:22,078 --> 00:37:28,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I'm pushing for the TDM to be an important part of the ordinance.

292
00:37:28,725 --> 00:37:30,127
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where I'm coming from.

293
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,929
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the third

294
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:48,328
[SPEAKER_03]: thing on my Christmas list is to make it so that it's not some, all of these rules put together are not some Byzantine kind of overly complex structure that developers can't really understand.

295
00:37:48,368 --> 00:37:57,532
[SPEAKER_03]: So I understand that that could end up getting a little bit contradictory after a while, but it's sort of those three things are what's on my mind right now.

296
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:14,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and to be honest, there are areas where if you could only increase one floor, then it gets very difficult, because then you don't have so much from where to choose.

297
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:23,159
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will be like, oh, or you do the affordable, or you do amenities, or you do whatever, because you only have one extra floor.

298
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:24,380
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot give too much.

299
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:31,503
[SPEAKER_00]: But in places like a corridor where we have Mystic Avenue, that we can go quite higher.

300
00:38:33,204 --> 00:38:42,068
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have affordable, you can have, if you have a point-based system, then you can have affordable, you can have amenities, you can have different things.

301
00:38:42,468 --> 00:38:43,508
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the TDM.

302
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,271
[SPEAKER_00]: We were also talking about activating ground floor.

303
00:38:50,732 --> 00:38:53,473
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have a lot of things, not only one,

304
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,814
[SPEAKER_00]: and that depends on the area.

305
00:38:56,214 --> 00:39:03,676
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can really give an incentive of building because you have height, then you can do more things.

306
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:20,202
[SPEAKER_00]: In the areas that we don't have a lot of height because of the neighborhood, because it doesn't fit the area, because it cannot be very much dense, then in those you can have

307
00:39:20,982 --> 00:39:32,967
[SPEAKER_00]: be very more simple and say, okay, you have affordable, you have the TDM, or I don't know if the TDM is for any anywhere, it will be only for the bigger corridors, I think.

308
00:39:33,627 --> 00:39:37,409
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but yeah, there is a lot of research to do.

309
00:39:37,929 --> 00:39:49,894
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it depends a bit on the area if we have that ability to grow versus if we can only do it in in a smaller, in just a smaller increase in increment.

310
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:52,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Paula.

311
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:56,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I recognize President Burris.

312
00:39:57,503 --> 00:39:57,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

313
00:39:59,185 --> 00:40:00,747
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a great start.

314
00:40:00,827 --> 00:40:04,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's, I kind of like the Portland model versus another point space model.

315
00:40:06,758 --> 00:40:17,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Although if we did a point space model maybe for this and for TDM and for green score and we could use the same scale for all of them that might be a way to also use a point space model and have the simplicity.

316
00:40:17,814 --> 00:40:21,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think we don't want to overload this I think, you know, to me.

317
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:25,514
[SPEAKER_06]: .

318
00:40:24,673 --> 00:40:25,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we are talking about

319
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:51,471
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, district squares and corridors only at this point.

320
00:40:51,612 --> 00:40:55,194
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, I'd be open to thinking about it in other ways.

321
00:40:55,914 --> 00:41:03,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the overlays and the infill are ways to go into the neighborhoods and not have this incentive zoning model be the same application.

322
00:41:05,762 --> 00:41:11,726
[SPEAKER_06]: but to me, right, if we're talking Salem street, the quarter we've been discussing, you know, we're talking about four by right.

323
00:41:11,806 --> 00:41:14,408
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the incentive would only go up to six with a step back.

324
00:41:14,608 --> 00:41:27,517
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, really all you could say is if you do a certain amount of affordable housing, you get two, or maybe if you do additional ground for commercial and investment in improving the transportation infrastructure, you get one story, something like that.

325
00:41:28,477 --> 00:41:33,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I think, uh, mystic ab is a little more open.

326
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I think we're talking like maybe a,

327
00:41:36,473 --> 00:41:39,136
[SPEAKER_06]: by right eight up to 12 or 14.

328
00:41:39,276 --> 00:41:47,102
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a little bit more room there, but I still think you could get there pretty simply if you left your incentive categories relatively simple, and then also did it by floor.

329
00:41:47,122 --> 00:41:57,130
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we could treat like green score and TDM as separate things since most of these are, we're talking all of these, everything I've just talked about would trigger site plan review.

330
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:01,233
[SPEAKER_06]: So that might be the way to kind of,

331
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:01,913
[SPEAKER_06]: to be able to.

332
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:07,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Avoid this Byzantine bureaucracy and still do, uh, all three of these things at once.

333
00:42:10,116 --> 00:42:13,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great way to put it.

334
00:42:13,417 --> 00:42:14,657
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.

335
00:42:15,257 --> 00:42:15,537
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

336
00:42:16,438 --> 00:42:16,738
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

337
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:18,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

338
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:19,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

339
00:42:20,819 --> 00:42:21,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to Councilor Callahan.

340
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks Um, yeah, just quickly that I

341
00:42:29,707 --> 00:42:32,009
[SPEAKER_02]: puts the work on us and not on the developers.

342
00:42:32,209 --> 00:42:34,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the developer will be like, oh, what is it for this neighborhood?

343
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:37,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, it's fairly simple for this neighborhood.

344
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:47,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It means that we have to do the work in advance, but that the developers may have more simple instructions because there will be neighborhoods where we're not worrying about one thing or another thing.

345
00:42:48,924 --> 00:42:49,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

346
00:42:50,045 --> 00:42:53,548
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I think what I keep coming back to in this conversation is,

347
00:42:55,031 --> 00:43:09,787
[SPEAKER_07]: we're talking about a mechanism that is mostly going to be seen and useful in those zones where there is a larger potential discrepancy between minimum allowable by right height and that maximum bonus height.

348
00:43:11,148 --> 00:43:13,891
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our squares and our corridors, especially the corridors.

349
00:43:15,272 --> 00:43:19,394
[SPEAKER_07]: that are currently a mix of or aspiring to mixed use and commercial.

350
00:43:20,335 --> 00:43:43,368
[SPEAKER_07]: And so thinking about it in those terms, focusing it there, I think that this makes sense to target on the squares and corridors, because that's where we really have the space in terms of those potential bonuses to curate that tight list of priorities, but know that at development of those scales, we might be able to see developers who are able to have those negotiations to get affordable housing and some

351
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:52,837
[SPEAKER_07]: dovetailing with investments in transit street infrastructure, because to me that's really the use case of this.

352
00:43:53,037 --> 00:43:55,459
[SPEAKER_07]: So I agree with what my colleagues have said.

353
00:43:55,479 --> 00:44:06,390
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really excited to see this pushed forward and I think that this is going to harmonize really well with some of the other incentive schemes that we're

354
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:12,690
[SPEAKER_07]: working on and kind of thinking of site plan review as a bit of a like organizational mechanism.

355
00:44:12,751 --> 00:44:31,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that we're considering a bunch of different incentive schemes now, but I hope that there's, you know, I think that we can stay in conversation about how to make sure that that process stays streamlined so that it's achievable for planning staff and, you know, becomes a legible, followable rule book for developers.

356
00:44:34,823 --> 00:44:36,425
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like we have a path forward on this.

357
00:44:36,685 --> 00:44:45,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further comments on incentive zoning from councilors, staff, Paola, do you feel like you have a read on where we're at on this?

358
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:50,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I think that I really agree with you.

359
00:44:51,575 --> 00:44:56,058
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to make it so complex that then it's very difficult to follow.

360
00:44:56,078 --> 00:45:11,929
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we will try to make it as simple as possible, but also getting the most of it so that we can really see per neighborhood a bit of the needs or mainly per corridor and squares.

361
00:45:12,889 --> 00:45:13,590
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the needs?

362
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,712
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen it also in sensitive zoning in

363
00:45:17,512 --> 00:45:24,305
[SPEAKER_00]: just incentivising affordability in residential where they are multi-family units.

364
00:45:24,881 --> 00:45:38,212
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they will say, you can build two more units if, or you can build until, for example, if the maximum is four, you can build until eight, if two of those at least are affordable units.

365
00:45:38,752 --> 00:45:49,201
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only, and that is the incentives only for the district in order to get as much as possible the affordable units.

366
00:45:49,801 --> 00:45:51,102
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can try,

367
00:45:52,363 --> 00:45:58,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time, the next steps will be try to see what are these, where do we want to apply them?

368
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:02,146
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the incentives that we want to do?

369
00:46:04,447 --> 00:46:11,609
[SPEAKER_00]: And to have a menu, if it's a smaller, bigger, and try to feed a score that makes sense and that is similar to the green score.

370
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:13,990
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great idea.

371
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:18,071
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, and see and share it with you.

372
00:46:21,616 --> 00:46:23,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I want to throw out the idea too.

373
00:46:23,457 --> 00:46:33,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that the, um, let's say that these are kind of, and I like what Paula just said about in the neighborhood, like we have the square and corridor districts, then we're going to have the neighborhood districts.

374
00:46:33,485 --> 00:46:38,709
[SPEAKER_06]: I think something like what was just mentioned, like in the neighborhood districts would make sense for,

375
00:46:40,155 --> 00:46:41,955
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more about the units and the affordable housing.

376
00:46:41,975 --> 00:46:44,076
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a little bit simpler.

377
00:46:44,116 --> 00:46:46,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if it's three, maybe you could get four.

378
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:47,996
[SPEAKER_06]: If the fourth is affordable.

379
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:49,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's probably not going to work.

380
00:46:49,237 --> 00:46:53,257
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw in Somerville, they tried to do, you could do triple-decker, but one of them has to be affordable.

381
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:54,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody built anything.

382
00:46:54,638 --> 00:46:56,238
[SPEAKER_06]: So they went citywide triple-decker.

383
00:46:56,598 --> 00:47:08,360
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think at that scale, but the four to eight with two affordable or one affordable, you know, you're still talking about a 12, 12% affordable, even if one of those units is affordable deed restricted, which is,

384
00:47:09,406 --> 00:47:14,402
[SPEAKER_06]: I think higher than we're requesting right now in a 10-unit building, if I'm remembering the inclusionary right.

385
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:17,930
[SPEAKER_06]: So something like that might work.

386
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:30,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think another thing that would be helpful, um, let's say we went with ground floor commercial, uh, investments in improving transit infrastructure and affordable housing as three things for the incentive zoning.

387
00:47:31,797 --> 00:47:36,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then we can have green score and TDM also as out there as well.

388
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:43,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would be useful for like the community development board to make an recommendation on a regular basis about, um,

389
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:52,302
[SPEAKER_06]: minimum thresholds, like if we were to do ground floor commercial, would it be 20% of the ground floor, a certain amount of square footage relative to the size of the building?

390
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:57,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Affordable housing as well, I think is a little simpler.

391
00:47:57,985 --> 00:48:00,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Transportation funding just to factor in.

392
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:09,168
[SPEAKER_06]: exactly that situation that I was just mentioning out of Somerville where they said, Oh, we'll do triple deckers everywhere, but one has to be affordable.

393
00:48:09,288 --> 00:48:13,190
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't an effective policy because it didn't build any new housing units.

394
00:48:13,731 --> 00:48:20,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I think we want to make sure if we were to say a hundred percent of the first, if you get extra floor, it's 15 foot step back.

395
00:48:20,874 --> 00:48:25,717
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's only 60% of the square foot of the first floor and the whole first floor has to be commercial.

396
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:27,638
[SPEAKER_06]: that's not going to get us anything.

397
00:48:27,678 --> 00:48:30,640
[SPEAKER_06]: We're actually reducing, you know, it's a countervailing force.

398
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:44,629
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think some element of the zoning where the CD board is, who's reviewing these in site plan review is kind of making a recommendation every so often based on their experience as to what these thresholds should be for different incentives, I think would be helpful too.

399
00:48:46,951 --> 00:48:49,012
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of that's from William's email.

400
00:48:49,553 --> 00:48:50,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other part of it,

401
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:54,317
[SPEAKER_06]: that I think is harder is adjusting to market conditions.

402
00:48:55,078 --> 00:49:03,621
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, I have a harder time saying, well, if the interest rate's 7%, then we should only ask for half as much affordable housing or half, you know, that's, I think, a much harder argument to make.

403
00:49:04,582 --> 00:49:16,167
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think at least getting it right and getting those recommendations based on the CD board's experience and site plan review of how these incentives are playing out will be really useful.

404
00:49:18,888 --> 00:49:19,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.

405
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:20,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Pierce.

406
00:49:24,036 --> 00:49:26,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, well, thank you for laying out the next steps on that, Paola.

407
00:49:26,937 --> 00:49:38,422
[SPEAKER_07]: Really excited to start reviewing draft language around a incentive zoning policy and get into the details on exactly what districts that we discussed will comprise it.

408
00:49:40,502 --> 00:49:41,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

409
00:49:41,223 --> 00:49:42,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to our next agenda item.

410
00:49:44,764 --> 00:49:45,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

411
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:02,583
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have the condominium conversion.

412
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:09,107
[SPEAKER_00]: This was Emily reviewed, Emily Ennis, the director of Ennis Associates.

413
00:50:09,247 --> 00:50:15,711
[SPEAKER_00]: She reviewed the Vice President Cullen's research on the condominium conversion topic.

414
00:50:17,992 --> 00:50:18,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Um.

415
00:50:18,172 --> 00:50:27,257
[SPEAKER_00]: She, um, came to the conclusion that maybe Somerville's the section 7 64 is the most complete and could be an interesting pursuit.

416
00:50:27,997 --> 00:50:30,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Um but this is a city ordinance.

417
00:50:31,439 --> 00:50:32,980
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a zoning by law.

418
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:39,083
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can discuss these a bit more internally, and we can help with

419
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,821
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you for making that determination.

420
00:50:47,861 --> 00:50:48,462
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

421
00:50:48,542 --> 00:50:54,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure who it was that told me condo conversion was definitely a zoning ordinance, but whoever it was, it was two years ago.

422
00:50:54,207 --> 00:50:56,089
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm shaking your head.

423
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:57,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I wasn't accusing you, definitely wasn't you.

424
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:00,213
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, great.

425
00:51:00,233 --> 00:51:02,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on to housing definitions.

426
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:02,835
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Paola.

427
00:51:03,573 --> 00:51:20,089
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah and sorry today I had five public meetings so I'm sorry but I'm a bit my brain is a bit half gone um so it's a bit more harder for me for today to talk um but I will go through the definitions I think that I will go through them

428
00:51:20,689 --> 00:51:23,470
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we can please make any comments.

429
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,370
[SPEAKER_00]: This was also done by Emily.

430
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:28,591
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already saying this in advance.

431
00:51:31,712 --> 00:51:32,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I just cut in here?

432
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:47,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you just begin with a little context on, are these all new definitions that we're considering adding to our zoning bylaws to have them in place when new zoning ordinance makes reference to them?

433
00:51:47,476 --> 00:51:49,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is there other context that we should know about these?

434
00:51:50,259 --> 00:51:53,381
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are mainly new.

435
00:51:55,241 --> 00:52:02,125
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there are some, but they should be the, you have some of them that are the original definition.

436
00:52:03,686 --> 00:52:11,729
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we wanted to have in here is to compile all the different ways that people could live together.

437
00:52:11,749 --> 00:52:18,653
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had the definitions for co-living, co-housing, multi-tenant, congregate housing,

438
00:52:19,693 --> 00:52:34,884
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have some that are your original definition, some of them, and I think I have the notes so I can go through them, and some of them, if they are not, they will tell where they come from.

439
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:38,406
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we taking the definition from?

440
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:40,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you.

441
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:48,197
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that sounds good to my fellow councillors, just with understanding, I know you've had a very long day of public meetings, I'd love it if you could give us an overview of these.

442
00:52:48,277 --> 00:52:57,426
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if councillors have questions on where the definition came from or want to get more into the weeds, please just wave your hand at me and we can pause there.

443
00:52:57,906 --> 00:53:01,950
[SPEAKER_07]: But otherwise, I think we can just go through the definitions themselves.

444
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,581
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.

445
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:09,223
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is nothing that I'm going to say here is going to be, this is it.

446
00:53:09,863 --> 00:53:13,684
[SPEAKER_00]: This is supposed to be the base so that we can talk about it.

447
00:53:13,805 --> 00:53:16,666
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can say, look, the co-living, I think it's interesting.

448
00:53:17,886 --> 00:53:19,867
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we research a bit more on that?

449
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:22,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we definitely do not need this type of

450
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:26,610
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, congregate housing.

451
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,891
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just to make a conversation.

452
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:31,932
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nothing to be set in stone.

453
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:41,335
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can actually, I would love that this is sent around through the councillors, and that you can give us comments.

454
00:53:41,995 --> 00:53:50,278
[SPEAKER_00]: That we really appreciate, because you better know what you really want, and so it will help us to get your feedback.

455
00:53:51,624 --> 00:54:07,908
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start, we have co-living, a building in which a group of four or two eight residents occupy a single unit with private bedrooms and share living spaces, including cooking and sanitary facilities.

456
00:54:09,144 --> 00:54:24,543
[SPEAKER_00]: GoHousing, this is a group of buildings in common ownership, which include small single unit or two unit buildings and a single building with shared living spaces, such as a common room, library, dining room, kitchen, etc.

457
00:54:26,661 --> 00:54:37,826
[SPEAKER_00]: The congregate living, we have different ones that use different terms or that are specifically oriented, for example, in Cambridge to the elderly.

458
00:54:38,586 --> 00:54:44,109
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Somerville they use congregate housing, it's a residential occupancy of a dwelling unit,

459
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:50,991
[SPEAKER_00]: by more than four unrelated individuals that are handicapped as defined in 42 U.S.C.

460
00:54:51,412 --> 00:54:57,254
[SPEAKER_00]: section 3602 or have a disability as defined in 42 U.S.C.

461
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,115
[SPEAKER_00]: section 1202.

462
00:55:01,775 --> 00:55:09,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Both terms are defined as physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more

463
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:20,506
[SPEAKER_00]: major life activities, a record of such an impairment or being regarded as having such an impairment not including the current illegal use of or addiction to a controlled substance.

464
00:55:21,366 --> 00:55:37,237
[SPEAKER_00]: In Cambridge, they use elderly-oriented congregate housing, a form of elderly-oriented housing in which each individual or two-person family is provided with a separate quarters which contain living and sleeping space and which may contain

465
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:39,941
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen and bath facilities.

466
00:55:40,662 --> 00:55:44,747
[SPEAKER_00]: Each such living space shall be considered the equivalent of one dwelling unit.

467
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:49,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Such housing shall also contain common dining, kitchen and social facilities.

468
00:55:50,135 --> 00:55:53,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Limited supportive services may also be provided.

469
00:55:53,996 --> 00:55:57,398
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Arlington, it will be a group home.

470
00:55:57,598 --> 00:56:16,108
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a dwelling owned or leased by a state agency or a nonprofit organization on behalf of the state agency, operated as supervised residence for adults with severe disabilities, which may include educational, social health care, and other supportive services.

471
00:56:17,429 --> 00:56:19,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, in contrast with dormitory,

472
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:41,188
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Cambridge, any dwelling other than a sorority or fraternity house owned or controlled by an educational institution and occupied primarily as a place of temporary residence for persons whose permanent residence is elsewhere and who are employed or enrolled at the educational institution.

473
00:56:42,188 --> 00:57:01,547
[SPEAKER_00]: in Somerville, residential occupancy of a building or portion of a building in dwelling units or rooming units exclusively by full or part-time students, faculty and staff of an educational institution and any housing owned by or affiliated with an educational institution.

474
00:57:02,888 --> 00:57:08,171
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, for example, is Medford, your current definition of dormitory.

475
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:22,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Building designed for or occupied as a residence for students or staff, owned by or under the supervision of an institution or an educational youth, which is not operated as a gainful business.

476
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:27,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the definitions of single room occupancy.

477
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:31,735
[SPEAKER_00]: In Medford, the current is the lodging house.

478
00:57:32,435 --> 00:57:48,766
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a dwelling in which living space without individual kitchen and with or without kitchen privileges is designed, occupied, or intended for occupancy by or led for compensation to five or more lodgers, including a rooming house or a boarding house.

479
00:57:49,486 --> 00:57:58,369
[SPEAKER_00]: but not including a senior housing facility, hotel or motel, dormitory, fraternity or sorority house, or other building of institutional or educational use.

480
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:10,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Somerville rooming house, residential occupancy of four or more rooming units by individuals or up to two persons related by blood, marriage, adoption, or foster care agreement.

481
00:58:11,212 --> 00:58:16,494
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooming houses include boarding houses, lodging houses, and single room occupancy buildings.

482
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:34,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Cambridge, lodging house, a dwelling where lodgings are led to four or more persons, not within the second degree of kinship to the person conducting it, including fraternity housing, but not including dormitories or charitable, educational or philanthropic institutions.

483
00:58:35,757 --> 00:58:38,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Burbank, they have single room occupancy hotel.

484
00:58:40,307 --> 00:58:51,792
[SPEAKER_00]: means housing composed of individual efficiency dwelling units where each unit has a minimum floor area of 150 square feet and a maximum size of 500 square feet.

485
00:58:52,272 --> 00:58:58,415
[SPEAKER_00]: To qualify as an SRO, no more than 10% of the units may contain individual kitchens and bathrooms.

486
00:58:59,175 --> 00:59:01,356
[SPEAKER_00]: Any unit not developed within an individual

487
00:59:01,816 --> 00:59:07,981
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen or bathroom must have access to common areas containing kitchen and bathroom facilities.

488
00:59:08,681 --> 00:59:18,909
[SPEAKER_00]: SROs are not linked to any on-site or off-site services, including but not limited to life skills counselling, childcare or job training and placement.

489
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:28,036
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get to shared housing or multi-tenant housing, and this one comes from Salt Lake City.

490
00:59:29,201 --> 00:59:39,364
[SPEAKER_00]: a building or portion thereof that is designated for residential purposes and contains individual housing units that may be occupied on a weekly or monthly basis.

491
00:59:40,104 --> 00:59:44,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Each individual housing unit consists of one or more sleeping rooms,

492
00:59:45,706 --> 00:59:49,888
[SPEAKER_00]: and may contain either kitchen or bathroom amenities but not both.

493
00:59:50,548 --> 01:00:03,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Whichever amenities are not contained within the individual unit, the kitchen, bathroom or both shall be provided as a common facility within the same building to be shared with other tenants or of the shared housing development.

494
01:00:04,215 --> 01:00:05,576
[SPEAKER_00]: And this definition comes with

495
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:16,703
[SPEAKER_00]: The following standards, housing will be subject to the same lot and bulk requirements as multifamily dwelling use, but not the density requirements of the underlying zone.

496
01:00:17,263 --> 01:00:21,646
[SPEAKER_00]: A maximum of two people per sleeping room may reside within an individual shared housing unit.

497
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:26,489
[SPEAKER_00]: A minimum floor area of 100 square feet per sleeping room is required for a single tenant.

498
01:00:27,309 --> 01:00:30,090
[SPEAKER_00]: and 120 square feet per sleeping room for two tenants.

499
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:39,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Communal areas, including but not limited to libraries, lounges, recreation rooms, and dining rooms, et cetera, must be provided and must be accessible to all tenants.

500
01:00:40,172 --> 01:00:50,434
[SPEAKER_00]: The minimum floor area of communal areas exclusive of kitchens, bathrooms, hallways, and maintenance and storage areas is 20 square feet per sleeping room.

501
01:00:51,877 --> 01:01:01,686
[SPEAKER_00]: A property manager is required to be inside 24-7 in communal areas, except bathrooms must be continuously monitored by security cameras.

502
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:08,212
[SPEAKER_00]: A shared house in development can include an office and private living unit for the property manager.

503
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:12,877
[SPEAKER_00]: This private living unit can include a private bathroom and kitchen.

504
01:01:15,302 --> 01:01:16,023
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is it.

505
01:01:16,543 --> 01:01:37,586
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all the ones that we this is a for us a working document so we will continue to research if there's anything that you really like and say this this is it otherwise if nothing really fits what you need we can continue to to look

506
01:01:39,087 --> 01:01:46,414
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can continue, and this, what we want is to continue to research in all the different ways that people can live together.

507
01:01:46,434 --> 01:01:53,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts?

508
01:01:54,721 --> 01:01:59,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely want to take a look at this doc later with a little more time.

509
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:03,509
[SPEAKER_02]: First thought is that, you know,

510
01:02:05,171 --> 01:02:13,077
[SPEAKER_02]: want us to encourage more density within buildings we have a lot of homes that have four or five bedrooms and one person living in it.

511
01:02:13,758 --> 01:02:19,463
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we want to go ahead and encourage folks to live with each other.

512
01:02:21,775 --> 01:02:25,536
[SPEAKER_02]: to relieve our affordable, our sort of housing issues that we have here in Medford.

513
01:02:25,836 --> 01:02:36,517
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanna make sure that if we're making definitions that we're not sort of defining anything as more than four people living together, it's like a separate sort of definition of living.

514
01:02:36,538 --> 01:02:38,638
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanna be a little bit careful on that front.

515
01:02:38,698 --> 01:02:45,679
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like some of those definitions are like anything more than four and you're defined as a strange form of housing.

516
01:02:45,739 --> 01:02:50,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my only thinking without really having time to sort of look more deeply into it.

517
01:02:52,699 --> 01:03:01,288
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we would love that you can look at it and give us any comments, even exactly what you're looking for and that we can continue to search.

518
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:08,716
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the ways that we have seen in the areas that are around Medford.

519
01:03:10,337 --> 01:03:18,340
[SPEAKER_00]: that how they have it, but we can totally continue to look even further and see if there is anything that makes more sense.

520
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:30,545
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely we want your feedback, we want your comments and exactly your vision and that we can we can try to find it or create one definition.

521
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:34,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

522
01:03:34,572 --> 01:03:35,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Paola.

523
01:03:35,794 --> 01:03:41,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, like Councilor Callahan, I think, you know, this is the type of thing that I can't really digest for the first time in a meeting.

524
01:03:41,381 --> 01:03:42,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I think now that we

525
01:03:44,189 --> 01:04:08,623
[SPEAKER_07]: know that committee members have these range of options, we can consider these, come back at a future meeting and I'm sure we can quickly arrive at a consensus for which it makes sense to go with and come back with more informed considered opinions on modifying some of these examples and making sure that all the best parts from different cities templates

526
01:04:09,625 --> 01:04:21,714
[SPEAKER_07]: are present in the definitions that we go with, and of course, we'll want to also consider the expertise of city staff when we're putting forward new definitions into our zoning code.

527
01:04:23,075 --> 01:04:26,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other initial comments?

528
01:04:26,137 --> 01:04:39,226
[SPEAKER_07]: And Paola, I believe I have a file of this PowerPoint from just before our meeting, so I'll make sure that's circulated to committee members so that folks can have time to review this before we consider it again.

529
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:40,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

530
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:43,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other comments on this topic tonight?

531
01:04:49,793 --> 01:04:58,136
[SPEAKER_06]: One, actually, just we should make sure that none of this conflicts with the changes we made about the definition of family and people living in a household.

532
01:04:58,557 --> 01:05:00,757
[SPEAKER_06]: We removed a lot of language around

533
01:05:03,407 --> 01:05:07,530
[SPEAKER_06]: blood relations and things that courts have said we can't actually legislate.

534
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:09,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't want to add anything back, obviously.

535
01:05:10,653 --> 01:05:12,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of what Councilor Callahan was saying, similar.

536
01:05:14,256 --> 01:05:15,116
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.

537
01:05:15,136 --> 01:05:20,781
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just bringing in if there is anything that is interesting in those definitions.

538
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:27,286
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we will adapt them to the language that we prefer to use and we want to use.

539
01:05:31,923 --> 01:05:32,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you.

540
01:05:32,723 --> 01:05:34,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing no other comments from councilors at this time.

541
01:05:34,884 --> 01:05:39,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Paolo, is this the last item on our agenda for tonight?

542
01:05:39,466 --> 01:05:48,370
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're gonna just touch base on the status of corridors for our next committee meeting in two weeks, but we'll be saving our substantive conversation for then, is that correct?

543
01:05:49,338 --> 01:05:59,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the quarters we will present a draft for the next week and then to talk about the sorry in two weeks and to present the, uh.

544
01:06:00,462 --> 01:06:02,863
[SPEAKER_00]: West Medford and Medford Square.

545
01:06:04,863 --> 01:06:05,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

546
01:06:05,203 --> 01:06:05,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

547
01:06:05,523 --> 01:06:06,444
[SPEAKER_07]: We look forward to that.

548
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:11,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Um before a solicit any final thoughts from

549
01:06:17,582 --> 01:06:20,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

550
01:06:21,184 --> 01:06:35,631
[SPEAKER_04]: So, quickly, I just wanted to add that when we consider affordable housing, that we take into consideration all possible approaches to achieve that goal.

551
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:37,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm worried

552
01:06:39,073 --> 01:06:54,302
[SPEAKER_04]: regarding what President Perez mentioned that, for example, by trying to get developers to include an affordable unit in whatever they're building, we're actually disincentivizing them from building affordable housing.

553
01:06:54,643 --> 01:07:01,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like to see a study of how a policy like that compares, for example, with

554
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:29,683
[SPEAKER_04]: making the permitting process a lot easier, a lot simpler, lowering development costs in such a way that, you know, units become cheaper, more affordable, because I also fear that, you know, we might end up with a few affordable units versus a lot of more affordable market rate units.

555
01:07:30,823 --> 01:07:53,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't done the analysis and I don't have a solution right now, but I would love to see all, you know, a bunch of different approaches considered and some sort of analysis so we can actually pick the best approach, the optimal approach to achieving the goal of affordable or at least more affordable housing in Mexico.

556
01:07:53,894 --> 01:07:54,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

557
01:07:57,736 --> 01:07:58,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Gaston.

558
01:08:01,223 --> 01:08:16,227
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, thank you all so much for this robust discussion, kickoff discussion about green score and incentive zoning and I'm glad we got to lay eyes for the first time on those new additions to housing definitions within our code of ordinances.

559
01:08:17,227 --> 01:08:23,389
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have our next steps for our partners in zoning on green score and incentive

560
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:31,379
[SPEAKER_07]: zoning and really looking forward to getting some draft language on corridors and squares at our next committee meetings.

561
01:08:31,419 --> 01:08:32,539
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a big step forward.

562
01:08:32,599 --> 01:08:40,201
[SPEAKER_07]: And so much of our prep work on zoning this year has been gearing up to those really major goals.

563
01:08:40,361 --> 01:08:41,981
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's exciting to be at this point.

564
01:08:42,981 --> 01:08:46,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much to my fellow councilors, city staff for guiding us in this process.

565
01:08:46,362 --> 01:08:48,522
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, to you, Paola and your team and associates.

566
01:08:50,603 --> 01:08:52,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking forward to some really substantive work

567
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:56,612
[SPEAKER_07]: between mid-November, sorry, mid-September and November.

568
01:08:57,912 --> 01:09:01,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further thoughts from my fellow Councillors before we adjourn?

569
01:09:04,976 --> 01:09:06,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing none, do I hear a motion?

570
01:09:09,057 --> 01:09:12,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn, seconded by Councillor Lemming.

571
01:09:17,081 --> 01:09:20,503
[SPEAKER_07]: And let me check if we are still hybrid.

572
01:09:22,401 --> 01:09:23,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we are.

573
01:09:24,643 --> 01:09:25,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, thank you Councilor Scarpelli.

574
01:09:27,985 --> 01:09:28,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Whenever you're ready Mr. Clerk.

575
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:29,025
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

576
01:09:30,707 --> 01:09:30,827
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

577
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:30,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

578
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:31,207
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

579
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:38,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't always get my way.

580
01:09:50,998 --> 01:09:52,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Five in favor, none opposed.

581
01:09:52,601 --> 01:09:53,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Meeting is adjourned.

582
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:53,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all.

583
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:55,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
