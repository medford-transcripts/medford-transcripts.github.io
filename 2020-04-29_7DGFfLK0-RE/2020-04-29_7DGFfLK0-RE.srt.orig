1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:00,491
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone.

2
00:00:00,511 --> 00:00:08,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for tuning in to Solidarity Live where we take questions and stories from the community in Somerville and Medford.

3
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:12,901
[SPEAKER_04]: We bring in experts to talk about those issues and then we work to solve those together.

4
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:17,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Today I have on someone from the Welcome Project.

5
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:25,611
[SPEAKER_04]: She's going to talk all about everything they do with our immigrant community and a specific fund that she's working with today.

6
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:27,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to bring her right in.

7
00:00:27,312 --> 00:00:27,612
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is

8
00:00:29,834 --> 00:00:31,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me have her join us.

9
00:00:34,896 --> 00:00:40,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, this is Kenya Alfaro of The Welcome Project.

10
00:00:40,819 --> 00:00:42,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Kenya, you're live.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.

12
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:45,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, how are you?

13
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:49,643
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing well, as well as I guess you can be right now.

14
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:50,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:03,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love for you to just tell us a little bit about what the Welcome Project does in general, and then specifically how you're dealing with COVID.

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

17
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,152
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Kenya Alfaro.

18
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:09,974
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the Director of Parental Engagement at the Welcome Project.

19
00:01:10,717 --> 00:01:17,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are an immigrant nonprofit based in the city of Somerville, but we work with immigrants throughout the whole greater Boston region.

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:28,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And our mission is to build the collective power of immigrants so that they can participate in community decisions, whatever that might look like, whether it be cities or schools or their own neighborhoods.

21
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:36,527
[SPEAKER_02]: And so usually what we would have kind of going on throughout the school year is an array of different programs.

22
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:44,254
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our largest program is our adult ESOL program and we serve over 200 adult immigrants in those classes.

23
00:01:44,374 --> 00:01:51,201
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an interpretation program for bilingual high school youth in both Medford and Somerville high school.

24
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:52,282
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have

25
00:01:52,867 --> 00:02:03,554
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of different other youth programming that focus on K-8 students, whether it be cultural identity, and just kind of exploring what it means for them to be bicultural.

26
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:18,283
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we act upon a lot of different organizing movements as well, like the driver's license campaign here in Massachusetts, we have a rapid response network serving to, you know, inform community members of any ICE activity as well.

27
00:02:18,643 --> 00:02:20,885
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just kind of like a quick snapshot of

28
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:22,850
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, usually what we have going on.

29
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:23,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

30
00:02:23,972 --> 00:02:33,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I will mention, I just got a comment from someone saying that there's a little bit of an echo, so I don't know if anybody's not muted or because we have people later in the show who are on right now.

31
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,281
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you can mute, that would be great.

32
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:38,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully this problem will resolve.

33
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:40,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

34
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:50,314
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like you guys really have good insight into our immigrant population and how they're doing.

35
00:02:51,374 --> 00:03:01,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would love to hear as much as you can how our immigrant community is doing now during COVID.

36
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:20,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, yeah, so I think we've taken the past, I don't know how many days we've been in this situation, just to kind of assess some needs and figure out, you know, a lot of the first initial things we're finding out how our families that we were working with were doing.

37
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:26,499
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it became, well, how are the rest of our immigrant families doing throughout these cities?

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:36,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, through the Welcome Project, we were hearing a lot of stories of folks losing their jobs, of folks kind of being getting worried about paying rent.

39
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:40,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Food access was becoming a really, really large issue.

40
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the city of Somerville, you know,

41
00:03:44,112 --> 00:03:48,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I think really stepped in and did a lot of things to provide some of those food resources.

42
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:54,379
[SPEAKER_04]: You're saying food resources are a problem because of just lack of funds, is that right?

43
00:03:54,559 --> 00:04:03,245
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lack of funds, but also, you know, at a certain point, you also did have to like really fast, you had to have a mask to go inside a grocery store and lots of people didn't have

44
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:08,066
[SPEAKER_02]: So they felt intimidated to go into grocery stores to go and get the supply of the food.

45
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:15,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And so funding and kind of that fear of like going, what if people are going to judge me if I don't have the proper attire to go inside?

46
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:23,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So those kind of were coming about just in the people that we were talking about, people that we were talking to.

47
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,950
[SPEAKER_02]: And that spurred us to, we had, we

48
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it seems like you've frozen.

49
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:44,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, so give me one second, everyone.

50
00:04:44,842 --> 00:04:48,366
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like we had a little problem with Skype.

51
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:51,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on.

52
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:26,892
[SPEAKER_04]: We are just trying to get Kenya Alfaro back on from the Welcome Project.

53
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:48,436
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ahead and do what I can.

54
00:05:49,268 --> 00:05:55,632
[SPEAKER_04]: to get Kenya back on, to get our folks from Tufts Mutual Aid back on.

55
00:05:56,473 --> 00:05:59,415
[SPEAKER_04]: They are also, ah, great.

56
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:01,776
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks like, ah, we have everyone back.

57
00:06:01,957 --> 00:06:02,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.

58
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:04,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So sorry about that.

59
00:06:04,678 --> 00:06:10,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not know exactly what happened, but I lost all of you and my whole Skype went down.

60
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:12,203
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize.

61
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, everyone, for sticking with us.

62
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:15,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So Kenya.

63
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:24,911
[SPEAKER_04]: You were talking about food resources and how the city of Somerville has really done some work there to make food resources available to people.

64
00:06:26,616 --> 00:06:27,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did.

65
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:32,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, the public schools, we were hearing a lot of families kind of going into the public schools.

66
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,682
[SPEAKER_02]: They did an amazing job at providing breakfast and lunch for a lot of families.

67
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:41,406
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the food pantries like started up and running and trying to really get some food out to families.

68
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:45,788
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, I think we've heard that be an issue.

69
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:55,975
[SPEAKER_02]: And the calls I've been making maybe the past two weeks as well, I've been hearing a lot of people who are still worried about food in other cities, not in Somerville, but in other cities as well.

70
00:06:56,758 --> 00:06:57,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, yeah.

71
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:10,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you know if folks in that community have been plugging into the mutual aid, so the Medford and Somerville mutual aid, or in any of the other cities' mutual aid projects?

72
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:13,749
[SPEAKER_02]: A few of them had.

73
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:19,913
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot who had not heard of mutual aids, nor did they understand the concept of a mutual aid, right?

74
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:24,116
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I also, you know, like, was learning about, okay, what does this mean?

75
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:24,956
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it look like?

76
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:31,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I think the past two weeks that we've been, I've been making a lot more phone calls.

77
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:35,944
[SPEAKER_02]: My next question is, oh, did you know that you can also get food from other places?

78
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:48,455
[SPEAKER_02]: have you contacted mamas, have you contacted like the Cambridge or have you practiced other mutual aid networks to get them plugged into different resources so that they know that they're out there.

79
00:07:48,475 --> 00:07:59,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it comes, people are very surprised, at least the families that I work with, they're very surprised that someone's just going to go delivery groceries to their front doorstep, but they're really, really appreciative of that as well.

80
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, yeah.

81
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,983
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have a particular fund that you administer, is that right?

82
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:07,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to talk a little bit about that?

83
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:08,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.

84
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:16,088
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Immigrant Assistance Fund that we have running through the Whatcom Project right now, it is

85
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,777
[SPEAKER_02]: We started, we had a donor who really wanted to help out.

86
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:25,460
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew that there were a lot of economic hardships and we knew that we wanted to help out.

87
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,581
[SPEAKER_02]: We just didn't, we weren't sure how to do it.

88
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:33,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there was a first step and more people wanted to see how they could help us and how they could donate and how they can help families.

89
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:41,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And it quickly became something very, I guess, easy that we said we needed to do something, even if it's,

90
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,572
[SPEAKER_02]: providing a little bit of financial support.

91
00:08:44,113 --> 00:08:51,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this fund is open to immigrant families in Somerville, Medford, Cambridge, Everett, and Malden.

92
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:56,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And specifically those areas, we know that Somerville does have some support services but

93
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:08,198
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of students who come from those different cities, and we really wanted to make sure that if our students are coming from those, that means that there are other families who are also in those cities who might also be needing some resources.

94
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,526
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we really wanted to be the outreach where in some cities there might not be as much support as maybe Somerville has.

95
00:09:15,566 --> 00:09:19,530
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to make sure that at least families could have a little bit of something through us.

96
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:24,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it's a very simple, I guess, quick application.

97
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:27,321
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a name and a phone number with language preference.

98
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And we give folks a call back.

99
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,745
[SPEAKER_02]: We ask a few questions.

100
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:33,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, we kind of see how we can support them.

101
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,673
[SPEAKER_02]: As we tell a lot of the families, it's not a lot of

102
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:44,479
[SPEAKER_02]: of money that we are able to support them, but it helps with a little bit that they might be having and then connecting them through different resources throughout.

103
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:59,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think, you know, a lot of the fund and the phone calls, you know, the communication with families is, yeah, we're providing them some financial support that they might need, but also it's about connecting them to different community resources that they might not be aware are there.

104
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:01,832
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just might be for many different reasons.

105
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:05,415
[SPEAKER_02]: It just may be communication, it be like language barriers or whatever it might be.

106
00:10:06,376 --> 00:10:16,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So this fund is just there to give a little, to just give a little, a partial little cushion for any expenses that they see for themselves and for their families, really.

107
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:16,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

108
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:26,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just remind people that if you have any questions, you can just put those in the comment box and we can pull those right in.

109
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:31,751
[SPEAKER_04]: In your outreach, you guys must have a lot of languages on hand, I imagine.

110
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:38,375
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're calling through people, how many different languages do you have to rely on to reach out to people?

111
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:40,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

112
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:45,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a native Spanish speaker, so I do basically all of the Spanish intakes.

113
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:49,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second language, the highest need that we had was Portuguese.

114
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:57,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, because we have an interpreters program within our organization, our interpreters have been able to help out in Portuguese.

115
00:10:58,806 --> 00:11:02,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanish and Portuguese have been the highest needs right now.

116
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:09,175
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some for Creole, which as well, we also have some interpreters and some other volunteers who were able to help.

117
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:14,019
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have some families that we work with who are higher, like English,

118
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,423
[SPEAKER_02]: confident and so they have also been helping us.

119
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,448
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been able to stipend them and they've been helping us as well with some of these calls.

120
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:27,794
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really thanks to the interpreters.

121
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:34,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I've rediscovered three-way calls again, which I had to Google how to do a three-way call.

122
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:52,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even though like our staff internally who are making the phone calls might not have all of those languages, we do have, you know, our mission within the Welcome Project, because it supports all of these programs, allows us then to have that language capacity to be able to reach out to as many families as we have.

123
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, that is great.

124
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And are there ways that people can help?

125
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:58,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it sounds like people can donate to that fund specifically.

126
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:03,791
[SPEAKER_04]: And the fund I assume is like directly related to COVID and it started with COVID.

127
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:05,593
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it really has to do with that.

128
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:08,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there other ways in addition to that, that people can help?

129
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:16,133
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as of right now, the donating to the fund is really, really amazing for us.

130
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:22,018
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always looking for, in-house we don't have folks who can help us maybe with like graphics.

131
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:33,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anyone is like volunteering for graphics or for media or photography or whatever it is, we're always kind of looking for ways for folks to help us create something that could give us a bigger outreach as well.

132
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:43,894
[SPEAKER_02]: So volunteering, there are a lot of skill sets that we wish we could have at the Wellcome Project, and sometimes it just takes that one reaching out to us and saying, hey, I have this skill set.

133
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:45,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any need?

134
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:46,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like any of this?

135
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:47,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually we do.

136
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:49,698
[SPEAKER_02]: We need some support in that.

137
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's another way as well.

138
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but like you said, this fund really came out because of COVID.

139
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:02,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to make sure that we are able to just keep sustaining this fund as much as possible.

140
00:13:03,607 --> 00:13:09,030
[SPEAKER_02]: then I would say about donating to this fund is also a huge, huge, huge way to help us.

141
00:13:09,711 --> 00:13:16,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, any other idea that you have, we have people approach us of, do you need art supplies for families?

142
00:13:16,494 --> 00:13:26,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, we'll take some, we'll deliver them, we'll kind of do like anything that's out of the box and creative, we will probably find a way that we can kind of use these volunteer opportunities.

143
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good.

144
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:30,443
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like at one point there was a need for masks.

145
00:13:30,563 --> 00:13:30,803
[SPEAKER_04]: I know

146
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:36,540
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a lot of folks and mamas are excited to make masks, so I don't know if that's something that people still need.

147
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:44,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, with this whole new rule in Somerville, we're kind of really trying to assess what that means.

148
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:55,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be clear, there's a new law in Somerville saying that when out of your house, you must wear a mask, and there's a fine, up to $300, I think, fine related to that.

149
00:13:55,777 --> 00:14:14,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Right and so we're you know we're trying to kind of assess what that looks like and if people are even hearing that news because a lot of this news does go out through any communication like city communication and a lot of our families aren't actually subscribed to that nor do they feel comfortable subscribing to those email communications or even phone call communications.

150
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:15,619
[SPEAKER_02]: So

151
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:38,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been asking whenever people tell me like oh I haven't been going to the groceries I try to ask them is it because what is it like do you need a mask and I've had a few people who have said yeah I would like a face covering and I would like a mask but we're not entirely sure how we would even get them those to them quite yet so we are trying to brainstorm and really rethink what this

152
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:47,302
[SPEAKER_02]: what this order, what this law means for our families and the impact that it's going to have on them and also accessing other different resources, basic, basic resources.

153
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:49,324
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might be a need.

154
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:55,070
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, there's some things that we don't even think about on the spot that someone could email us and say, hey, did you think about this?

155
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,292
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you know if you need this?

156
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:58,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And we might actually need it.

157
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:00,356
[SPEAKER_02]: We just haven't actually thought about it in the moment.

158
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

159
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:10,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to give just a little plug for how people can find you, how people can donate to the fund, or help out in other ways?

160
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:12,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Specifically, what's the website?

161
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:13,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.

162
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:22,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So folks can visit our website, it's welcomeproject.org, and you can find information about us and other programs that we have as well.

163
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:34,551
[SPEAKER_02]: We are thinking about potentially doing things virtually this summer, and so one of the things that we're always looking for are ESOL teachers or folks to help us with our, like, camp or after-school programming.

164
00:15:35,632 --> 00:15:39,974
[SPEAKER_02]: That website will kind of give you more of a better overview, I think, of what we do.

165
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:54,743
[SPEAKER_02]: If you would like to donate, there's also a little blue button on the top right corner as well that you can donate, or you can also find out a bit more information about our fund right there as well, or any other resources regarding COVID in multiple cities as well.

166
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, thank you so much.

167
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Great work that you guys are doing.

168
00:15:59,531 --> 00:16:02,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful to have you on and keep us updated.

169
00:16:02,572 --> 00:16:07,614
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us know as things change, if there are more needs and other ways that people can help.

170
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:09,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you so much for having me.

171
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:11,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, great to have you.

172
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:24,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So our next guests are from, hang on, we're gonna add, from Tufts Mutual Aid.

173
00:16:25,642 --> 00:16:33,192
[SPEAKER_04]: We have, I'm getting closer, here we go, Madeline Clark and

174
00:16:40,211 --> 00:16:45,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Nikhil and Nikhil, I'm gonna let you say your name because I think I might get it wrong.

175
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:51,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what, I hope that you two will introduce Tufts Mutual Aid and introduce yourselves.

176
00:16:52,033 --> 00:16:57,574
[SPEAKER_04]: And somehow my computer is not plugged in, like it's plugged in to my, and my battery's gonna die.

177
00:16:57,614 --> 00:17:03,035
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm gonna duck out for just one second in this COVID home studio here.

178
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,736
[SPEAKER_04]: But why don't you go ahead and introduce Tufts Mutual Aid and yourself.

179
00:17:09,902 --> 00:17:10,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I have you live now.

180
00:17:14,264 --> 00:17:14,984
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think you're muted.

181
00:17:15,004 --> 00:17:15,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, great.

182
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:16,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Nikhil, great.

183
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:17,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.

184
00:17:18,925 --> 00:17:25,828
[SPEAKER_00]: So Madeline and I are part of the many, many organizers and members of Tufts Mutual Aid.

185
00:17:26,328 --> 00:17:37,172
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're essentially a collective of people who are coming together, well, kind of banded together really quickly after Tufts announced, just like many other universities.

186
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:55,749
[SPEAKER_00]: shutdown and like cessation of live classes and other activities and a transition to virtual learning and that meant that people had to move off campus essentially across the country across the world for like more than five days.

187
00:17:55,769 --> 00:17:55,809
[SPEAKER_00]: So

188
00:17:57,488 --> 00:18:05,855
[SPEAKER_00]: mutual has been specifically has been focused on making sure that the students who are most in need of resources get the resources that they need.

189
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:08,097
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, we're a facilitator.

190
00:18:09,158 --> 00:18:09,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

191
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to add anything to that, Madeline?

192
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:20,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I think you covered it very, like really well.

193
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:23,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, and

194
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that's about covers the basics.

195
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:37,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you tell us some of the stories that you've heard as you've been working with the folks that you're working with?

196
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:38,346
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you hear from people?

197
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,711
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening in their lives as a result of these changes?

198
00:18:50,755 --> 00:19:01,806
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I think there's just such a huge variety in the circumstances that students are in, and I'll just probably start chronologically from

199
00:19:02,776 --> 00:19:08,380
[SPEAKER_00]: the need to really find the resources to move off campus, essentially.

200
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,201
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first challenge, I think.

201
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:29,213
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of monetary resources for travel, finding a place to stay, so housing, and also finding food and other resources that you need for literally just packing and all these things that just come up, unexpectedly, because this is by definition a very unexpected situation.

202
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,164
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, we've obviously as an educational institution.

203
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:45,467
[SPEAKER_00]: had to deal with as students and also as professors and instructors and just members of the Tufts community had to deal with this new virtual mode of learning.

204
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:52,032
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the experiences that we had in person didn't directly translate to a virtual environment.

205
00:19:52,412 --> 00:20:00,038
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people are in either in homes that do not really support their academic success.

206
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:03,181
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be because for a range of reasons, we've heard people

207
00:20:04,181 --> 00:20:22,671
[SPEAKER_00]: with unwell parents or other relatives and people that they're living with in very small cramped spaces or in not emotionally just unsustainable and unhealthy environments as well at home and having added responsibilities.

208
00:20:22,991 --> 00:20:32,436
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of like academic and policy and systemic changes that had to come about not only in terms of tangible resources but also in terms of

209
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:50,715
[SPEAKER_00]: the wide variety of situations that students found themselves in and like really making sure that their voices were heard by the administration and allowing them a platform to like voice those changes, voice their concerns and their needs and really get those needs met.

210
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:55,329
[SPEAKER_00]: and change the expectations that we have as well.

211
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:59,251
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a question from Joel Greenberg.

212
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:03,174
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, how much notice were people given to move off campus?

213
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:05,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems like a huge burden for students and families.

214
00:21:10,078 --> 00:21:15,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was about, I think it was like five days, just about.

215
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:20,725
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we got the, or maybe six, we got an email notification

216
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:33,028
[SPEAKER_03]: on March 10th that we would have to leave campus and everyone had to be gone by the following Monday.

217
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:40,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was like the five, six days in between there were just a madhouse.

218
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you could just feel like the panic and the grief in the air.

219
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,473
[SPEAKER_03]: And both of us are seniors.

220
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:48,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was just the added layer of,

221
00:21:49,332 --> 00:21:56,957
[SPEAKER_03]: This time is supposed to be the last couple months, getting to have some closure.

222
00:21:56,977 --> 00:22:00,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And so having to rush all of that was definitely difficult.

223
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:10,105
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of tough students live off campus anyways.

224
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:13,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Most juniors and seniors live in off-campus houses.

225
00:22:13,487 --> 00:22:15,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there are a lot of folks who have stuck around.

226
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:19,071
[SPEAKER_03]: But obviously, it's very different since we can't

227
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:22,779
[SPEAKER_03]: be seeing each other anymore.

228
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

229
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

230
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:42,527
[SPEAKER_04]: And would you say, I mean, obviously you don't know numbers, but maybe you do, like what percentage of tough students actually had to leave town, like had to find, like were on campus and had to find somewhere else and ended up maybe going home?

231
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:47,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

232
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:49,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know any numbers off the top of your head?

233
00:22:50,134 --> 00:22:56,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it has to be above half the student body, definitely.

234
00:22:57,026 --> 00:23:00,371
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be at least 60 to 70 percent of students because

235
00:23:02,844 --> 00:23:11,211
[SPEAKER_00]: students who left campus are either juniors or seniors because you have to stay on campus for the first two years, so that's already half the population of Tufts.

236
00:23:12,132 --> 00:23:21,320
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's obviously seniors like me who did live on campus or juniors, whatever year you are, even graduate students who had to just

237
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:22,133
[SPEAKER_00]: leave.

238
00:23:22,493 --> 00:23:26,298
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly it's definitely in the thousands.

239
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:33,989
[SPEAKER_00]: If you include graduate students as well it's definitely in like about four or five, easily five thousand or more.

240
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:37,414
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah it's just massive

241
00:23:37,844 --> 00:23:39,425
[SPEAKER_00]: like move out of students.

242
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:41,846
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just, that's a tough as a medium-sized school.

243
00:23:43,026 --> 00:23:54,511
[SPEAKER_00]: There are obviously, you know, state schools across the country and, you know, other places that have to, that essentially are moving literally millions of students across the country and world.

244
00:23:54,791 --> 00:23:56,212
[SPEAKER_00]: So, lots.

245
00:23:57,252 --> 00:23:57,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

246
00:23:57,532 --> 00:23:59,613
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, it's interesting because when I

247
00:24:00,478 --> 00:24:15,852
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first heard of Tufts Mutual Aid, I thought, okay, it's like, you know, the other mutual aid societies helping provide, you know, helping people make sure they're safe, that they can pay their rent, that they can get groceries and things.

248
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:23,659
[SPEAKER_04]: But it sounds like you are also pretty deeply involved in making sure that students who have to now continue their education,

249
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:28,429
[SPEAKER_04]: are able to do that part of it.

250
00:24:28,729 --> 00:24:33,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, how do you balance those?

251
00:24:34,313 --> 00:24:45,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, you know, what do you feel has been happening for students who have to continue their education, have to do everything online?

252
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:49,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how disruptive has that been to their education?

253
00:24:49,524 --> 00:24:54,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe talk about that side, just the educational aspect of it.

254
00:24:58,206 --> 00:25:13,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so I will probably speak a little bit about this just because um I've had the privilege to be involved with a group of students just but like we we honestly are working collectively together on pretty much everything in mutual aid which is one of the most beautiful things about it.

255
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:24,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly have not seen a more like restorative and like inspiring thing um movement happen in a long while if if not since I've come to Tufts.

256
00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:27,460
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly like it's really

257
00:25:27,977 --> 00:25:33,042
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really great to see people kind of pouring their energies into what they're passionate about.

258
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:45,713
[SPEAKER_00]: So a bunch of us kind of worked on these systemic changes that we wanted the administration to make and liaised with the Senate, where that already has existing relationships with the admin.

259
00:25:46,073 --> 00:25:53,960
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually like made a course guidelines proposal that initially wasn't pulled from the student body,

260
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:03,624
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't exactly, you know, voicing every single concern that the students had, but it was taken from the surveys that we sent out with the general concerns.

261
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:08,626
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also later what we did is sent out another survey asking what people needed.

262
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:10,947
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the beginning, there were a bunch of surveys.

263
00:26:10,987 --> 00:26:13,288
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we kind of gathered information.

264
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:21,491
[SPEAKER_00]: And within this like course changes or guidelines proposal to the, essentially the like,

265
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:29,529
[SPEAKER_00]: higher-ups like the deans of engineering, the school of engineering arts and sciences, we identified like some core issues.

266
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:35,252
[SPEAKER_00]: So we requested that attendance requirements and synchronous learning were not required.

267
00:26:35,312 --> 00:26:47,179
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't, that means you should be able to access and view all course material including discussions and provided some suggestions of how to conduct discussions asynchronously with multimodal engagement.

268
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,042
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that I think should be a feature of education in general.

269
00:26:51,122 --> 00:26:51,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean like

270
00:26:51,942 --> 00:27:11,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I can talk forever about pedagogy so this is very much my area of interest and I feel I have a lot of strong feelings about it but in this situation I think it was most important to make sure that students could do what they needed to do and take care of themselves and their lives and their home lives which has so much variety without

271
00:27:11,738 --> 00:27:19,020
[SPEAKER_00]: conforming to rigid standards set by the existing academic system that we have in higher education here in America.

272
00:27:19,401 --> 00:27:33,105
[SPEAKER_00]: So, which itself is comparatively sometimes, depending on like what other educational systems you're comparing to, could be a lot more relaxed and liberal, but that's only when I think people in power allow

273
00:27:33,837 --> 00:27:41,060
[SPEAKER_00]: students, allow faculty, allow everyone else to feel comfortable to make their own decisions and choices and feel like they actually have an option.

274
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:50,123
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one big thing we advocated for, making things available online, the option of alternative assessments and really sending out a statement to urge

275
00:27:51,951 --> 00:28:12,061
[SPEAKER_00]: all faculty, which got sent out to all faculty, to urge them to switch away from traditional exams because the level playing field, which in my opinion does not even exist, because there's so many systemic barriers and so many uneven turfs that we navigate just in our like multiple identities every single moment.

276
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:15,863
[SPEAKER_00]: So that supposed playing field, level playing field,

277
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:21,645
[SPEAKER_00]: would not exist if you are taking an exam from varied environments and not like all in the same room.

278
00:28:22,005 --> 00:28:23,826
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that was an argument we could easily make.

279
00:28:23,886 --> 00:28:34,071
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of targeted what we collectively knew that the administration would respond to combined with what we felt the student body would most need.

280
00:28:35,331 --> 00:28:41,954
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, yeah, that kind of summarizes and also like having exam policies that allow students to take

281
00:28:42,599 --> 00:29:05,339
[SPEAKER_00]: exams unproctored, and in terms of like the efficacy of it, a lot of this did not actually amount to, because as we know policy change takes quite a long time, and especially when the administration and others are dealing with so many unexpected factors of this pandemic, they

282
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:10,833
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't really making the systemic or like policy level changes.

283
00:29:11,113 --> 00:29:32,772
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they would have, might have been, I'm not sure whether they would have been able to, but it's something that we definitely are urging for the future so that students have a more equitable educational experience, but essentially just making sure that the word gets out so that then faculty who do have a lot of breadth of choice in terms of like what they require for their courses

284
00:29:34,114 --> 00:29:40,477
[SPEAKER_00]: make a decision that works for them and for the students because they're also facing additional responsibilities a lot of the time.

285
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:41,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

286
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:47,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a last question about the other side.

287
00:29:47,567 --> 00:29:53,191
[SPEAKER_04]: So the making sure people can get groceries, they can pay for their rent, all of these things.

288
00:29:54,772 --> 00:30:03,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen, for the students that remain, are you interfacing at all with mamas, with another different mutual aid?

289
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,982
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this mostly students helping students?

290
00:30:06,062 --> 00:30:07,703
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you able to help

291
00:30:10,365 --> 00:30:23,413
[SPEAKER_04]: those students who are in the area to be able to sort of afford the changing circumstances that are happening to them now, but specifically like rent, food, the basics?

292
00:30:24,774 --> 00:30:35,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we have an on-campus food pantry that got started in the wake of campus closing.

293
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:39,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were able to secure like an on-campus space in our campus center.

294
00:30:41,082 --> 00:31:08,833
[SPEAKER_03]: And with all the students moving out, we were able to collect an enormous amount of food from students leaving and convert that to food to supply a pantry and then have been restocking it with support from Tufts Dining Services and very generous donations from the Graduate Student Council and a couple other sources.

295
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:13,777
[SPEAKER_03]: The pantry has been getting an enormous amount of use.

296
00:31:14,697 --> 00:31:16,118
[SPEAKER_03]: It's open Monday through Friday.

297
00:31:16,298 --> 00:31:21,499
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time that I go, a couple students will pass through.

298
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time I go, we will have needed to restock it already.

299
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:38,204
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we aren't collecting any kind of hard data on how much food is flowing through it or how many students are using it, just for privacy reasons and just the capacity.

300
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:42,957
[SPEAKER_03]: or lack thereof, of being able to keep track of those kind of numbers.

301
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:47,219
[SPEAKER_03]: But just anecdotally, it's been getting a lot of use.

302
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:56,226
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's super heartening to know that we're able to help fill a gap in people having access to food.

303
00:31:57,526 --> 00:32:06,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether that's just because they're nervous to go to a grocery store or can't afford it, just being able to support the Tufts community in that way has been super

304
00:32:08,121 --> 00:32:09,422
[SPEAKER_03]: heartening to be a part of that.

305
00:32:10,522 --> 00:32:21,607
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're hoping that the pantry will be able to stay open at least until the end of the school year, if not for the summer as well, and hopefully lays the groundwork for something more long-term.

306
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:25,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's been like a good, a helpful stopgap measure in the meantime.

307
00:32:25,948 --> 00:32:30,330
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, yeah, so it's been getting a lot of use.

308
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:30,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

309
00:32:31,111 --> 00:32:32,231
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you see as the long-term?

310
00:32:35,802 --> 00:32:45,090
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to know at this point, because there's still so much uncertainty as to whether students will even get to return to campus in the fall.

311
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:53,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like every day I'm reading some kind of article that talks about one side or the other.

312
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:57,741
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think it's impossible to know at this point.

313
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,943
[SPEAKER_03]: like what the fall will look like.

314
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:09,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's tricky because like both of us are seniors and so it won't affect us directly.

315
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:23,258
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's, I know I have a lot of friends who are juniors and just the uncertainty of knowing if they'll get to come back for their senior year is heartbreaking and yeah, really scary.

316
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.

317
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:29,143
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, how can, what can people do?

318
00:33:29,163 --> 00:33:30,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, does it like, like it really has been,

319
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:47,097
[SPEAKER_04]: the Tufts Mutual Aid is the students helping the students, students who have moved, leaving food, and the graduate students helping in the, you know, so are there ways that other people in the community can be helpful, and what would that be?

320
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there, I mean, several ways, I think.

321
00:33:57,128 --> 00:34:16,725
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all I think when Madeline talked about the food pantry earlier that has been one of like our core like very grounding efforts that you know she and so many other people have put such an amazing amount of effort into and there's really paid dividends um like that has been really useful even for me personally um I can definitely speak to that.

322
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:19,928
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something we'd love to

323
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:22,859
[SPEAKER_00]: love to see continue.

324
00:34:22,959 --> 00:34:37,802
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, Madeline, you could probably say more about how we might want to continue that or solicit donations for the pantry, if possible, especially to rescue food.

325
00:34:37,882 --> 00:34:41,703
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, Madeline's like one of the coordinators for food rescue at Tufts.

326
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:46,644
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so that's something that we'd love to continue, right?

327
00:34:47,944 --> 00:34:48,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

328
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:50,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, definitely.

329
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:56,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, like I said, it just always seems like we're running out of food in the pantry.

330
00:34:58,746 --> 00:35:12,792
[SPEAKER_03]: We're connected with some local non-profits that have been really supportive in helping us access food, but any other resources are just like, whether that's actual food or

331
00:35:14,065 --> 00:35:17,346
[SPEAKER_03]: or just advice on how to run a food pantry.

332
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:26,250
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been super helpful for us since we're students and there are staff members that have been really helpful in getting it started.

333
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,191
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an incredibly collaborative process.

334
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:30,751
[SPEAKER_04]: And how can people reach you?

335
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:31,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a website?

336
00:35:31,512 --> 00:35:34,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there an email address people can reach out to?

337
00:35:34,113 --> 00:35:34,513
[SPEAKER_04]: A phone number?

338
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:34,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything?

339
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:49,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think we have a Facebook page for Tufts Mutual Aid that is checked on by several volunteers daily, and that's Tufts Mutual Aid Facebook.

340
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:50,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there's anything else.

341
00:35:51,250 --> 00:36:06,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the Facebook page is actually the main point of contact, TUFTS, mutual aid, and essentially, for people who are not on Facebook, we do have a website that is also linked in the face.

342
00:36:06,718 --> 00:36:10,220
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe even without an account, you would be able to access the website.

343
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,543
[SPEAKER_00]: But our main point of contact is really the Facebook page, and you can ask for and offer help.

344
00:36:17,363 --> 00:36:33,290
[SPEAKER_00]: by messaging us or just taking a look at all the posts that we have about the pantry about other efforts especially like if you are a student to share your experiences doesn't matter where you are coming from or if you go here like one dream of ours is to really expand this

345
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,792
[SPEAKER_00]: keep this going not only for Tufts, but also outside of Tufts.

346
00:36:36,873 --> 00:36:46,420
[SPEAKER_00]: So we definitely want it to be a continued effort, certainly within our institutional community, but also outside of it.

347
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:54,867
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I think the semester is over, we really want to kind of branch out into better interfacing with mamas,

348
00:36:55,586 --> 00:37:12,237
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something I personally definitely wanted to do and like talking to other nonprofits, seeing how we can help because also there is a bunch of us who like really who whose summer plans have been you know either changed or you know ruined.

349
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:15,519
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah a lot of most students

350
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:22,363
[SPEAKER_00]: or would not be able to go to their in-person internships if they have any, or jobs or whatever they plan to do.

351
00:37:23,163 --> 00:37:37,432
[SPEAKER_00]: So students who are in the area and are willing and able virtually, we'd love to help out and to, you know, fulfill your mission and also like make sure that we can make this a sustainable effort and always open to new ideas.

352
00:37:38,372 --> 00:37:42,015
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that will definitely pick up in the next week or so.

353
00:37:42,815 --> 00:37:45,137
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be a great time to reach out and just kind of

354
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:57,754
[SPEAKER_00]: liaise with us and kind of just like figure out how we can not only get through this situation, but like life in general a lot more equitably than before.

355
00:37:58,374 --> 00:37:58,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

356
00:37:59,094 --> 00:37:59,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

357
00:37:59,674 --> 00:38:00,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

358
00:38:00,274 --> 00:38:01,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks both of you for coming on.

359
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:10,717
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really great to hear about, you know, this part of our community that we probably don't hear a lot about, you know, outside of the Tufts community.

360
00:38:12,518 --> 00:38:13,598
[SPEAKER_04]: really great work you're doing.

361
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:14,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for for doing it.

362
00:38:15,879 --> 00:38:16,600
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks for being on.

363
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:31,385
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so our next person, and I'm just gonna click click here for a minute or two.

364
00:38:31,405 --> 00:38:35,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we now have someone who is from here.

365
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:39,088
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's currently in South Korea.

366
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:52,841
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know how many people listening know about South Korea and the way that they have dealt with COVID, but it's very different from how the US has dealt with COVID.

367
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:56,002
[SPEAKER_04]: And so here is Howard Kim.

368
00:38:56,602 --> 00:38:58,542
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to pop your name up here.

369
00:38:58,562 --> 00:39:02,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And you are live.

370
00:39:02,203 --> 00:39:04,223
[SPEAKER_04]: So Howard, it's great to see you.

371
00:39:04,243 --> 00:39:06,444
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to see you as well.

372
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:07,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming on.

373
00:39:09,465 --> 00:39:10,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.

374
00:39:10,646 --> 00:39:11,266
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be here.

375
00:39:12,687 --> 00:39:16,729
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a software engineer usually based in the Somerville area.

376
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:24,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lived there for the last 10 years or so and was there right when COVID broke and my parents happen to live in Seoul, Korea.

377
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:32,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were, I got a lot of questions from my friends around early February saying, are your parents all right?

378
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:33,179
[SPEAKER_01]: Are your parents all right?

379
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you worried about your family?

380
00:39:35,461 --> 00:39:36,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was thinking,

381
00:39:36,685 --> 00:39:53,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm honestly a lot more worried about my friends and the people around us and myself than I am for my parents because I knew that the South Korean public health response was more better prepared for what was coming and has kind of been borne out in the numbers.

382
00:39:54,778 --> 00:40:04,945
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to share a little bit of my personal experience about going to Korea and all of that and what that entails and what I saw on the ground.

383
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:14,854
[SPEAKER_01]: and also the global situation as sort of a grounding factor for people who haven't been looking at the news.

384
00:40:15,855 --> 00:40:21,039
[SPEAKER_01]: So personally, I was in the same boat as everyone else, as everyone is in right now.

385
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:32,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent about two weeks in isolation from mid-March to the end of March, doing the quarantine thing that all the responsible citizens are doing.

386
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:35,257
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that it didn't make that much.

387
00:40:35,657 --> 00:40:37,799
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really lucky to have family in Korea.

388
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:40,341
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a US citizen.

389
00:40:40,401 --> 00:40:41,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I was born in the States.

390
00:40:41,402 --> 00:40:48,047
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was a little bit concerned that if I happened to get sick in Korea, I wouldn't be covered with health insurance there.

391
00:40:49,308 --> 00:41:00,957
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was seeing the news reports that was coming in about how there weren't enough ventilators, how there weren't enough doctors, how there wasn't any room in the hospitals, and that you have to wait until you're basically

392
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:08,028
[SPEAKER_01]: not to be frank, basically a death's door before you'd even be seen by a doctor.

393
00:41:08,108 --> 00:41:10,930
[SPEAKER_04]: When you say you're hearing this news, you mean in America?

394
00:41:11,711 --> 00:41:12,791
[SPEAKER_01]: In America, exactly.

395
00:41:13,312 --> 00:41:13,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

396
00:41:14,092 --> 00:41:17,855
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was thinking that that sounded really scary.

397
00:41:18,635 --> 00:41:28,002
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got onto a plane to Korea and came and landed on, I think, at the end of March, so March 30th.

398
00:41:29,177 --> 00:41:35,842
[SPEAKER_01]: and immediately got put through an immigration process and a kind of a quarantine process that I'd never seen before.

399
00:41:35,862 --> 00:41:38,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I've traveled to and from Korea a fair bit.

400
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:44,549
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically I was taken to a secure location and tested.

401
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:52,795
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically as soon as I got off the plane, I saw, as soon as I stepped out of the airport, I saw like lines of testing booths.

402
00:41:53,416 --> 00:41:54,517
[SPEAKER_01]: So very unlike

403
00:41:56,037 --> 00:42:07,923
[SPEAKER_01]: in the United States where you can't get a test unless you're, although I don't know, it's probably a little bit better now, but at the end of March, you basically could not get a test unless you, basically, you knew you already had it.

404
00:42:08,283 --> 00:42:19,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what I've heard is that it was, at first, you could only get tested, even if you had symptoms, you could only get tested if you had a known contact, if you'd been in contact with someone who was known to have had COVID.

405
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:23,050
[SPEAKER_04]: That was how limited the testing was, and now,

406
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it was if you had symptoms of COVID.

407
00:42:28,752 --> 00:42:33,875
[SPEAKER_04]: They're loosening it up a little bit, but it is still very difficult to get a test.

408
00:42:35,555 --> 00:42:36,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

409
00:42:36,396 --> 00:42:40,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that was on my mind when I made the move.

410
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:44,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically as soon as I stepped off the test, I got a free test.

411
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,181
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to be clear, I am not a Korean citizen.

412
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:50,002
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not have Korean health care.

413
00:42:50,022 --> 00:42:51,003
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anything like that.

414
00:42:52,317 --> 00:42:59,118
[SPEAKER_01]: but I basically got tested for free by people in proper PPE, protective equipment.

415
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:08,420
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was, for one day, I was taken to a secure location with all the other non-citizens while the test results came in.

416
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to ask if the test results had come back yet.

417
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:10,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

418
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:11,400
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.

419
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,881
[SPEAKER_01]: And they came in overnight.

420
00:43:13,261 --> 00:43:14,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Get the test back.

421
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:16,981
[SPEAKER_01]: So came in about six to 12 hours.

422
00:43:17,141 --> 00:43:17,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got to go.

423
00:43:18,302 --> 00:43:19,822
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically was free to go home.

424
00:43:20,627 --> 00:43:28,030
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a bunch of restrictions as I wasn't a citizen and, you know, coming in from the United States, I was potentially at risk for COVID.

425
00:43:30,171 --> 00:43:36,574
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was required to install an app and report in on my temperature two times a day.

426
00:43:36,594 --> 00:43:37,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

427
00:43:37,435 --> 00:43:38,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Which you took yourself.

428
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.

429
00:43:41,316 --> 00:43:44,258
[SPEAKER_01]: And my location was being monitored on my phone.

430
00:43:45,182 --> 00:43:54,391
[SPEAKER_01]: There was sort of an upfront cost that I had to take to kind of make the numbers that you see on television from South Korea happen.

431
00:43:55,992 --> 00:44:06,822
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, what I was doing, which is just basically staying at home, wasn't different than what I was doing before I left in a large way, because I was just staying at home regardless.

432
00:44:08,764 --> 00:44:09,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And the really nice thing

433
00:44:10,158 --> 00:44:14,701
[SPEAKER_01]: was that we got sent a care package from the local Korean government.

434
00:44:15,161 --> 00:44:15,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

435
00:44:16,282 --> 00:44:19,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some pictures and they're actually kind of ridiculous how much food they sent me.

436
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:23,587
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent me a solid two weeks of food to encourage me not to leave the house.

437
00:44:24,147 --> 00:44:24,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

438
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:35,795
[SPEAKER_04]: So even though you were tested and your test came back after one day, did they ask you to stay indoors for two weeks or did they just give you two weeks worth of food and then tell you you could go out?

439
00:44:36,597 --> 00:44:37,877
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was a requirement.

440
00:44:39,138 --> 00:44:52,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So people who walked around, there was, I think, someone from Britain who walked around and actually had COVID and he basically ignored the app requests and he was forced to leave the country as a result.

441
00:44:53,642 --> 00:44:55,843
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were taking this very seriously.

442
00:44:59,104 --> 00:45:03,365
[SPEAKER_01]: So this might sound a little bit crazy, but they actually had one

443
00:45:04,616 --> 00:45:09,779
[SPEAKER_01]: unannounced visit where they knocked on my door just to make sure that I was actually at home.

444
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:19,704
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might sound a little bit ridiculous, but at the same time, that's what everyone is being forced to stay at home now.

445
00:45:20,124 --> 00:45:22,945
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean here in Somerville?

446
00:45:22,965 --> 00:45:24,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, in the United States.

447
00:45:24,326 --> 00:45:25,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, excuse me.

448
00:45:27,096 --> 00:45:31,398
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I can go out, and I can walk around, and I can basically do regular things.

449
00:45:31,498 --> 00:45:34,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So you had two weeks of staying at home.

450
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,880
[SPEAKER_04]: You got tested.

451
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Your test came back negative.

452
00:45:38,241 --> 00:45:38,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

453
00:45:38,421 --> 00:45:45,664
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you were at home for two weeks, maybe because there's some chance that you could have had, and it hadn't shown up yet on the test.

454
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:48,345
[SPEAKER_04]: For whatever reason, you stayed home for two weeks.

455
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:53,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And after that time, now tell us what is your life like?

456
00:45:54,445 --> 00:46:17,607
[SPEAKER_01]: okay so after that time I got tested again and something that I glossed over was in that care package was not just food but there are also masks there are also there was toilet paper there was hand sanitizer basically all the necessities that you would need to stay at home for two weeks so it wasn't uncomfortable

457
00:46:18,017 --> 00:46:22,758
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was staying at my parents' house, which I chose, and you can basically pick your location.

458
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:26,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when you were staying at your parents' house, did they have to stay home?

459
00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:33,040
[SPEAKER_01]: So my parents did not have to stay home, as long as they didn't come into close contact with me.

460
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,140
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, great.

461
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

462
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,281
[SPEAKER_01]: So since then, life has been pretty much normal.

463
00:46:39,461 --> 00:46:47,782
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I go outside, I see about over 80% to 90% of people are wearing masks voluntarily.

464
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:49,771
[SPEAKER_01]: It is highly recommended.

465
00:46:49,811 --> 00:46:53,915
[SPEAKER_01]: You see advertisements everywhere for public health, on television all the time.

466
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:57,618
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are definitely still conscientious about it.

467
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,881
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, life is going on.

468
00:47:02,883 --> 00:47:06,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that even the movie theaters are open now, which is really nice.

469
00:47:06,826 --> 00:47:14,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, from what I heard from my friends who actually did go to the movie theater, there were only three people there, and there were two of them.

470
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,281
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still taking it very seriously.

471
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:18,062
[SPEAKER_04]: But restaurants, coffee shops?

472
00:47:18,982 --> 00:47:22,163
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they have a regular amount of people is what I would say.

473
00:47:22,303 --> 00:47:24,004
[SPEAKER_01]: The economy took a hit.

474
00:47:24,144 --> 00:47:25,885
[SPEAKER_01]: It took a hit the same as everyone else did.

475
00:47:26,405 --> 00:47:29,247
[SPEAKER_01]: But it hasn't ground to a halt.

476
00:47:30,827 --> 00:47:38,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike the traffic, which is now back to normal, and it's now very difficult to get anywhere by car, because people are basically out and about.

477
00:47:38,511 --> 00:47:41,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's borne out by the numbers, which shows that

478
00:47:42,105 --> 00:47:47,249
[SPEAKER_01]: For all of last week, the number of confirmed new cases a day was in single digits.

479
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:56,257
[SPEAKER_01]: And to put that in perspective, Korea was one of the worst hit countries by the outbreak when it first broke out.

480
00:47:56,697 --> 00:48:09,028
[SPEAKER_01]: So now to shift from my personal perspective where I kind of put in the costs that I had to do, which were honestly were not that severe, putting an app in two times a day, stay home for two weeks, get tested.

481
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,702
[SPEAKER_01]: All for free, got free care package to kind of incentivize that.

482
00:48:14,022 --> 00:48:22,105
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other end of that, I think at the end of February, there were a couple of thousand cases.

483
00:48:23,426 --> 00:48:30,129
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a large incident with a spreading incident where a lot of people got it all at the same time.

484
00:48:30,713 --> 00:48:37,077
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was sort of a panic response type of deal where the country didn't go into lockdown.

485
00:48:37,137 --> 00:48:44,581
[SPEAKER_01]: People still went to work, but people were advised to wear masks, advised to have hand sanitizer.

486
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:50,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would see hand sanitizer pretty much everywhere for free use in elevators, at restaurants.

487
00:48:54,054 --> 00:48:57,036
[SPEAKER_01]: And the number of cases dropped dramatically.

488
00:48:57,336 --> 00:49:02,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had a very robust trace and, what's the word?

489
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:03,419
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I looking for?

490
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,960
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically a tracing program.

491
00:49:05,741 --> 00:49:17,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, where anyone who had come into contact with a known confirmed case was asked to stay at home for two weeks, just as I was, who were at high risk, and then was given testing twice.

492
00:49:18,408 --> 00:49:21,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also implemented the

493
00:49:23,179 --> 00:49:28,822
[SPEAKER_01]: the drive-through response, which is basically drive-through testing.

494
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:38,928
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get tested in your car, a lot like getting a coffee from Starbucks or whatnot, and there would be basically no risk of exposure.

495
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:47,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask you, where does South Korea get all these tests?

496
00:49:47,493 --> 00:49:49,174
[SPEAKER_04]: We cannot seem to get tests.

497
00:49:49,494 --> 00:49:50,295
[SPEAKER_04]: You may not even know this,

498
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:59,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is there such a difference in the ability for people in South Korea to access tests than people like in Somerville, for example?

499
00:50:00,143 --> 00:50:04,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can we not access tests here?

500
00:50:04,727 --> 00:50:06,948
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple of reasons for this.

501
00:50:06,988 --> 00:50:15,575
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start with some things I absolutely know are for sure, and then step into things that are less confirmed but still

502
00:50:17,419 --> 00:50:18,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably true.

503
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:26,102
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sure is that Korea was exposed to an exponential respiratory virus in the past.

504
00:50:27,382 --> 00:50:31,924
[SPEAKER_01]: It had SARS in the early 2000s and then MERS again more recently in about around 2016.

505
00:50:32,924 --> 00:50:40,607
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the public consciousness and the government was kind of warned that this was coming, like in a very serious way.

506
00:50:41,106 --> 00:50:53,714
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 60 people died from MERS back in 2016, which may not sound like a lot, but when you're dealing with an exponentially growing virus as the way that these things are, that is potentially very scary.

507
00:50:55,936 --> 00:51:08,884
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the public health response has taken this seriously and has had a lot of testing scenarios in place in a way that the USA has not.

508
00:51:11,017 --> 00:51:14,939
[SPEAKER_01]: To move to, so that's why Korea has done very well in this regard.

509
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,440
[SPEAKER_01]: While the U.S.

510
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:25,706
[SPEAKER_01]: has done so poorly is, I think, a little bit more controversial, but a very large part of it, I think, has just been the federal response.

511
00:51:26,447 --> 00:51:31,390
[SPEAKER_01]: So from what I understand, in early February, late March, the U.S.

512
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:35,512
[SPEAKER_01]: government was actually offered a test that was developed internationally.

513
00:51:35,532 --> 00:51:36,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard about this.

514
00:51:37,053 --> 00:51:37,874
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, from Germany.

515
00:51:38,434 --> 00:51:39,455
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was turned down.

516
00:51:41,122 --> 00:52:02,700
[SPEAKER_01]: The reasons for which are unclear, but seem to lead to, what is it, the private health insurance company or private health companies looking to use their own testing to help benefit themselves at the potential cost of the public.

517
00:52:03,301 --> 00:52:08,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that is, whether or not that all of that is exactly as I said it isn't clear.

518
00:52:09,317 --> 00:52:12,159
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does seem to be that the U.S.

519
00:52:12,219 --> 00:52:19,142
[SPEAKER_01]: has a habit of prioritizing private industries rather than the public health at large.

520
00:52:19,783 --> 00:52:29,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I think that we're seeing right now, what effect that can have on communities and people and lives.

521
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:33,130
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that is something that really needs to change.

522
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:36,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think at all that

523
00:52:37,606 --> 00:52:39,767
[SPEAKER_01]: the Korean political system is perfect.

524
00:52:39,847 --> 00:52:43,870
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it has, it's a real country the same as everyone else.

525
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:51,856
[SPEAKER_01]: If you talk to people, they have the same problems with, that everyone has with their local politics and their country's politics.

526
00:52:52,396 --> 00:53:03,825
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I feel like there's a level of trust in the government and more abstractly in science in general to provide answers and

527
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:16,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, if people say, if people hear on the news, science suggests that you should do X because it is best for you and it's going to keep you safe, people will generally abide by that.

528
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:18,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

529
00:53:19,515 --> 00:53:23,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask, does South Korea have a national healthcare system?

530
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it absolutely does.

531
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:31,644
[SPEAKER_01]: It has basically the equivalent of Medicare for all in which everyone is on

532
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:35,087
[SPEAKER_01]: a government-issued health plan.

533
00:53:35,827 --> 00:53:39,389
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are no private options, as it were.

534
00:53:40,229 --> 00:53:55,315
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that South Korea is, actually, of all the world's developed countries, I can think of very few besides the United States that don't have a public health care policy.

535
00:53:55,996 --> 00:54:01,858
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that shows when private and public interests collide.

536
00:54:02,982 --> 00:54:05,585
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's really shown in the US today.

537
00:54:06,506 --> 00:54:09,349
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if that's a little too on the nose.

538
00:54:11,371 --> 00:54:15,375
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at the numbers, it's really quite striking.

539
00:54:16,576 --> 00:54:21,842
[SPEAKER_01]: So Incheon International Airport, which is 300,000 people, which is a major international hub,

540
00:54:25,788 --> 00:54:30,072
[SPEAKER_01]: took in 300,000 travelers in the month of March.

541
00:54:30,832 --> 00:54:39,620
[SPEAKER_01]: And not a single equivalent of their TSA, of those employees, not a single one of them have contracted COVID.

542
00:54:40,341 --> 00:54:41,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

543
00:54:42,263 --> 00:54:42,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is crazy.

544
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:52,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was walking through the lines, every single person I interacted with that was on staff was wearing PPE, was wearing a mask,

545
00:54:53,345 --> 00:55:00,967
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who were doing the testing were geared up from head to toe in what looked like an astronaut suit, basically.

546
00:55:02,368 --> 00:55:07,389
[SPEAKER_01]: They just took it seriously because they had seen the power of exponential growth.

547
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:11,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because you can't see it right now doesn't mean that it's not a threat.

548
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:19,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't wait until they saw people getting sick to take it seriously, I think is the other thing.

549
00:55:20,646 --> 00:55:21,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

550
00:55:21,746 --> 00:55:23,887
[SPEAKER_04]: It is such an amazing story.

551
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:31,170
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm so glad that you started with the personal story of your own experience living in Somerville.

552
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:36,672
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had not realized that you were here when COVID started.

553
00:55:36,772 --> 00:55:47,616
[SPEAKER_04]: And you decided to go to South Korea knowing that the South Korean reaction to this was going to be much better, was much better, and that you would be both safer

554
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:54,342
[SPEAKER_04]: and more free to go about your normal daily life in South Korea than here?

555
00:55:54,362 --> 00:55:58,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I actually wanted to touch on that point a little bit.

556
00:55:59,524 --> 00:56:09,028
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I saw a headline recently that somebody said something about South Korea not really being free because it's tracking people for all of these things.

557
00:56:09,857 --> 00:56:14,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can say that, but first of all, your phone is probably already tracking you already.

558
00:56:14,979 --> 00:56:18,461
[SPEAKER_01]: And by probably, I mean, it's tracking you already.

559
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:20,141
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the unfortunate truth of it.

560
00:56:21,062 --> 00:56:26,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Second is that I had to install an app by the government, but I could uninstall it after that was over.

561
00:56:26,464 --> 00:56:31,886
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like I'm being tracked any more than usual after the kind of risk period was over.

562
00:56:33,566 --> 00:56:37,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And third is that I feel a lot freer right now than I did in the United States.

563
00:56:39,069 --> 00:56:40,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very, very lucky.

564
00:56:40,370 --> 00:56:51,656
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to stress that enough, that I had the ability to work in a field where I don't have to show up, where I can work remotely.

565
00:56:52,276 --> 00:56:55,278
[SPEAKER_04]: And now in Somerville, you would be forced to work remotely anyway.

566
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:58,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you would still be having to work remotely right now.

567
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:58,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

568
00:57:01,785 --> 00:57:03,166
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because we need to.

569
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:06,468
[SPEAKER_01]: But we needed to a month ago and a month and a half ago as well.

570
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:08,048
[SPEAKER_01]: We just didn't see it yet.

571
00:57:09,229 --> 00:57:11,610
[SPEAKER_01]: We pretended that the problem was going to go away.

572
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:19,314
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's obviously not good public policy, because the problem is not going to go away.

573
00:57:19,954 --> 00:57:24,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's going to be with us for the next couple months or the next over a year remains to be seen.

574
00:57:26,898 --> 00:57:31,980
[SPEAKER_04]: But South Korea's response sounds like it's just a lot more sustainable than ours.

575
00:57:32,701 --> 00:57:51,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you guys are going about mostly about your normal business, but with the testing and tracing program that they have, the contact tracing program, they can contain it very well, while most people are kind of going about their daily lives, and the economy is not under a huge hit.

576
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:51,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that sound about right?

577
00:57:52,788 --> 00:57:53,008
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

578
00:57:53,454 --> 00:57:56,715
[SPEAKER_01]: people are really encouraged to get testing as much as possible.

579
00:57:57,215 --> 00:58:09,039
[SPEAKER_01]: So testing costs roughly the equivalent of I think it's 140 US dollars so it's not the cheapest thing in the world but first you can get them and second if you test positive it's free.

580
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:09,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

581
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:13,800
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's subsidized by the government and I think

582
00:58:14,462 --> 00:58:19,283
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now in the United States, I saw tests being put out there for about $2,000 to $3,000.

583
00:58:19,464 --> 00:58:20,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that incorrect?

584
00:58:21,744 --> 00:58:23,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that crazy?

585
00:58:23,145 --> 00:58:23,465
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

586
00:58:23,525 --> 00:58:24,325
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have to check.

587
00:58:24,405 --> 00:58:25,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I really have no idea.

588
00:58:25,625 --> 00:58:26,306
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll check on that.

589
00:58:26,326 --> 00:58:27,086
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be crazy.

590
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:28,086
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be right.

591
00:58:28,146 --> 00:58:34,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, hey, we're in the US where medical things cost ridiculous amounts of money.

592
00:58:35,388 --> 00:58:40,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but at the same time, I've heard that the testing kits are not very accurate.

593
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that they have a 20% to 30% false negative rate.

594
00:58:44,672 --> 00:58:46,553
[SPEAKER_04]: South Korean ones or United States?

595
00:58:46,573 --> 00:58:48,655
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not the South Korean ones, the United States ones.

596
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:52,857
[SPEAKER_01]: The South Korean ones have a false negative rate of, I believe, 5%.

597
00:58:54,138 --> 00:58:56,880
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not zero, but it's much better.

598
00:58:57,981 --> 00:59:03,324
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get to our experts and we'll ask about that here as well.

599
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:06,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm definitely not an expert on the medical side of things.

600
00:59:07,426 --> 00:59:12,910
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, from what I can see on the ground, it's really night and day, the difference.

601
00:59:14,010 --> 00:59:14,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So amazing.

602
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:16,731
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have something to look forward to.

603
00:59:18,031 --> 00:59:21,152
[SPEAKER_04]: We can get life back to normal and keep this thing under control.

604
00:59:22,752 --> 00:59:26,333
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has been really eye-opening to talk to you.

605
00:59:26,453 --> 00:59:28,154
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you coming on so much.

606
00:59:28,454 --> 00:59:31,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to say, it is kind of amazing that your Skype feed is great.

607
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:35,993
[SPEAKER_04]: half a world away from us.

608
00:59:36,314 --> 00:59:37,815
[SPEAKER_04]: So, good job Skype.

609
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:40,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no kidding.

610
00:59:41,257 --> 00:59:42,158
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, thank you so much.

611
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:45,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any last, any final words before we let you go?

612
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:47,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.

613
00:59:47,862 --> 00:59:49,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me on.

614
00:59:49,623 --> 00:59:51,044
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pleasure to be here.

615
00:59:51,484 --> 00:59:56,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, really fascinating to hear about what life is like there for you right now.

616
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:58,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope we get there soon.

617
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:00,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

618
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:01,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Great to talk to you.

619
01:00:05,221 --> 01:00:05,781
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, bye.

620
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:06,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you.

621
01:00:07,902 --> 01:00:09,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is it for our show.

622
01:00:09,363 --> 01:00:12,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everyone for tuning in.

623
01:00:12,224 --> 01:00:31,791
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it was everything that you dreamed of and we will be back next week with more stories and questions from our community, with more experts to talk about those issues and with more ways that you as a member of our community can plug in and how we can solve these problems together.

624
01:00:32,412 --> 01:00:32,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
