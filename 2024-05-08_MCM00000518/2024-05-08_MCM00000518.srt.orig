1
00:00:00,597 --> 00:00:03,680
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, everybody, we're here and we've got a lot to do this evening.

2
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:08,505
[SPEAKER_03]: But hopefully some of the things will become easier as we go on.

3
00:00:09,686 --> 00:00:17,834
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing is the approval of the minutes of our last meeting on March 5th, 2024.

4
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:19,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent them all to you.

5
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:21,958
[SPEAKER_03]: So do I hear a motion of approval?

6
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:25,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to approve.

7
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:30,829
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to make an amendment, but I see that what I was going to amend, I'm just blind as a bat and didn't see.

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,490
[SPEAKER_03]: And do I have a second?

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:35,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:36,991
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor, say aye.

11
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:37,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

12
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:39,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

13
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,052
[SPEAKER_03]: The minutes are approved.

14
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:49,533
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that recording was incredibly helpful because I went back and really went through it.

15
00:00:49,973 --> 00:00:51,554
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was very, very helpful to do that.

16
00:00:53,905 --> 00:01:00,651
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next thing, item number two, is feedback from former school committee member Sharon Guzik.

17
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:03,673
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could bring that up.

18
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,971
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Ron, can you give me permission to share my screen, please?

19
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:40,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:40,631 --> 00:02:02,575
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I know how to do that, Aubrey.

21
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:07,154
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three little buttons.

22
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:11,639
[SPEAKER_05]: The three little buttons by the circle by her name, Ron.

23
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

24
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:15,203
[SPEAKER_05]: Click on that and it says make co-host.

25
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:19,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Make co-host.

26
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:20,108
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

27
00:02:20,809 --> 00:02:22,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you do that, she can screen share.

28
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:23,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

29
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:24,753
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.

30
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:39,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so this was a response to an email I had sent out, and this is from former school committee member Sharon Guzik.

31
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:46,495
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first question is, what is your ideal term for a school committee term?

32
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:48,096
[SPEAKER_03]: And she wrote two to three years.

33
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:54,457
[SPEAKER_03]: The two years follow state and federal elections for representatives.

34
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:57,878
[SPEAKER_03]: It allows for change of the composition of the board more quickly.

35
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,906
[SPEAKER_03]: However, an alternating longer term would be excellent.

36
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:06,327
[SPEAKER_03]: This would allow for a turnover of one third or one half of the school committee.

37
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:10,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this option a lot as there is more continuity if the seats do turn over.

38
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:16,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, in my case, I really would have liked to have been on the school committee a year or two longer.

39
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:23,313
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a while for change to happen, so if one is advocating for a particular outcome, one may actually be able to accomplish it.

40
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:31,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it takes a while for idealistic newbies to really understand the constraints one has to work with and how things operate.

41
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:36,211
[SPEAKER_03]: This way would allow for the learning to happen and then be more effective for the rest of the term.

42
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:43,674
[SPEAKER_03]: When she asked, would a four-year term have lessened your willingness to run initially, is it too daunting?

43
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:44,915
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, absolutely not.

44
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:50,177
[SPEAKER_03]: For awards or at large for the school committee,

45
00:03:52,068 --> 00:03:56,597
[SPEAKER_03]: She says the idea of ward representation sounds good, but in practice may not work very well.

46
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:06,533
[SPEAKER_03]: One reason school committee and city council members seem to be clustered in certain areas of the city is because there were fewer people that stepped forward to run in other areas.

47
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:12,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the only school committee member with children at the Columbus at the time she was on the school committee.

48
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:16,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Very few people run from wards one, five, and seven, many reasons for that.

49
00:04:17,217 --> 00:04:23,279
[SPEAKER_03]: These may have changed in some areas with the increased income and subsequent loss of socioeconomic diversity in our city.

50
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,289
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, I think at-large is still the best option for the time being.

51
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you favor the mayor being the chair of the school committee?

52
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,658
[SPEAKER_03]: You may remember that I questioned this before I ran for school committee myself.

53
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:46,560
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was on the committee and saw how things operated, I realized that if the mayor has to participate in meetings, they know what is going on with the school's firsthand, or at least as well as the school committee members themselves.

54
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,060
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no excuse for them to plead ignorance.

55
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I think it's easier for the public to know that they have been heard by the mayor rather than sending off an email that an aide screens.

56
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:58,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you favor term limits?

57
00:04:58,796 --> 00:04:59,797
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, I do.

58
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:02,200
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is how many terms to limit to.

59
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say 10 to 12 years, five terms if we stick to the two-year terms or three terms if we move to four.

60
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:15,332
[SPEAKER_03]: There could be an option to run again after a term or two off the committee, maybe two two-year terms or one four-year term.

61
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:17,734
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point, most people would have moved on.

62
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:27,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's the end of Sharon's feedback.

63
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:30,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharon was a fantastic school committee member, best researcher.

64
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:39,633
[SPEAKER_03]: She and Beth Fuller were outstanding researchers in getting information to the other school committee members in my little commercial.

65
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:51,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the next item would be the document I submitted for the discussion with former Mayor Mike McGlynn and former Mayor Stephanie Muccini-Burke.

66
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:57,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start reading this as it's being located.

67
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:12,403
[SPEAKER_03]: I met with former Mayor Mike McGlynn and former Mayor Stephanie Burke separately, but was struck by the similarity in their thoughts, which coincidentally were not that far apart from what I heard when speaking to current Mayor Brianna Lungo-Kern.

68
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:21,067
[SPEAKER_03]: While my questions centered on the school committee, both McGlynn and Burke commented on their openness to change the city council from at-large to ward-based voting.

69
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:34,217
[SPEAKER_03]: When we spoke specifically about the school committee, both Burke and McGlynn voiced concern about the potential size increase that ward-based voting would bring to the school committee if a member was elected from each ward.

70
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:47,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Both former mayors expressed hesitation about increasing the size of the school committee, wondering whether more members would increase the difficulty of getting to consensus and noting the increased cost of additional counselors and school committee members.

71
00:06:48,408 --> 00:07:01,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Both McGlynn and Burke wondered if a combination of ward and at-large members would be the best option for the school committee, which could be achieved by combining the eight wards into four for the purposes of voting for school committee and having two at-large candidates.

72
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:17,008
[SPEAKER_03]: As in our charter subcommittee meetings on this topic, we spent considerable time exploring the options in our discussion, and both former mayors could see pros and cons to different options, trying to figure out the balance between effectiveness,

73
00:07:17,568 --> 00:07:20,409
[SPEAKER_03]: representation, and the potential cost factor.

74
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:25,670
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest takeaway from my discussion was clearly around the role of the mayor.

75
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Mayor Kern, both heavily favored keeping the mayor as chair of the committee.

76
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:33,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked specifically about the workload.

77
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:41,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Kern, both former mayors reported that the superintendent with a brunt of the work on putting together the agendas and organizing all

78
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:44,698
[SPEAKER_03]: the agenda items for presentation.

79
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:54,061
[SPEAKER_03]: While they certainly had discussions with the superintendent on an ongoing basis, neither felt that preparing for the meeting was onerous.

80
00:07:54,601 --> 00:08:01,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Both McGlynn and Burke told me that by being chair, it gave them the opportunity to be at a formal public meeting regularly.

81
00:08:02,002 --> 00:08:08,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly being chair, as opposed to just being a member, made sure they prioritized being at the meeting.

82
00:08:09,084 --> 00:08:16,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Both acknowledged that being on the school committee took up time, but they both felt it was one of the most vital and important roles they played.

83
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:26,917
[SPEAKER_03]: They noted that if we were going to award based voting system, it would be the mayor who is elected by all and believe that the mayor should retain the role as chair of the committee.

84
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:36,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Both McGlynn and Burke expressed how much deeper they understood the myriad of issues relating to the running of the school system because of their time as chair of the school committee.

85
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:44,344
[SPEAKER_03]: As for being just a member of the school committee rather than the chair, they said that the mayor is elected as mayor, not as a school committee member.

86
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:53,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Being chair really gave them the opportunity to listen to all the school committee members, as it is customary to have the members speak before the mayor speaks on an issue.

87
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:56,229
[SPEAKER_03]: So submit that for your

88
00:08:57,205 --> 00:08:57,965
[SPEAKER_03]: consideration.

89
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:00,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Any, any comments or feedback on those?

90
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:24,398
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one thing that struck me is, well, a few things, um, you know, in all of our discussions about the mayor being the chair of the school committee, um, and the surveys we've received and, you know, input we've received from the community seems to be a general consensus.

91
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:25,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

92
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:34,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe not a consensus, but a lot of people saying that the mayor should not be the chair of the school committee.

93
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:39,287
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we've spoken to.

94
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:44,452
[SPEAKER_01]: 3 mayors and they all really support the idea and want to be the chair.

95
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:50,746
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of interesting.

96
00:09:51,427 --> 00:09:52,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

97
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And Paulette and everyone, it just struck me.

98
00:09:55,468 --> 00:10:01,429
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure I was aware of it, but I don't know which of the mayors said it, but they said the mayor is elected by everybody.

99
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is really a critical piece of information that struck me.

100
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:16,613
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that, but the mayor is a person who is elected by everybody, and each of the school committee members were selected by their wards.

101
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:23,119
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that's a broader audience for the mayor also to run.

102
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:29,633
[SPEAKER_00]: My only comment to that is, you know, when the mayor goes to a Little League game, she's still the mayor.

103
00:10:29,993 --> 00:10:33,154
[SPEAKER_00]: When she goes to a school committee, she's full participant.

104
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:42,776
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the mayor, or he or she's the mayor, I should not use the mayor is the mayor, whether the mayor is setting the agenda and moving.

105
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:51,558
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it appears that a lot of the interviews with current school committee people, there was a desire to not make the mayor chairperson.

106
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:54,579
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the mayor is what I'm sorry,

107
00:10:54,979 --> 00:11:00,463
[SPEAKER_03]: You just heard from Sharon Guzik, who said she before she got on the school committee, she questioned that.

108
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:03,686
[SPEAKER_03]: But once she was on the school committee, she understood the value of having so.

109
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:10,397
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Jenny Graham is a big proponent of the mayor not being the chairperson.

110
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:14,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am a big proponent of the mayor being on the school committee.

111
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just, I think that there is a split as there are on many of these others.

112
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,324
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's two different things.

113
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:23,167
[SPEAKER_00]: One is being part of the school committee and one is being the chairperson of the committee.

114
00:11:23,227 --> 00:11:25,349
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two different things.

115
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:26,130
[SPEAKER_00]: The mayor,

116
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:37,252
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the mayor being part of the school committee makes sense to me because the mayor's job is to set policy for education, one of the major roles that she has.

117
00:11:38,152 --> 00:11:39,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, she's in charge of the budget.

118
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:43,696
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying, to me, there seems to be an air of

119
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:47,998
[SPEAKER_00]: people have a different opinion as to who should run those meetings.

120
00:11:48,198 --> 00:11:52,379
[SPEAKER_00]: The chairperson to me is the person who runs the meeting.

121
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:55,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Paulette, you run the subcommittee meetings.

122
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,601
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean you're more powerful than anybody here.

123
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:01,482
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were the mayor, you would still be the mayor.

124
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:04,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Those powers don't get lessened just because you're not the chairperson of that.

125
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:07,344
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think there's two points of view there.

126
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:07,724
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.

127
00:12:07,744 --> 00:12:08,645
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to make that clear.

128
00:12:08,665 --> 00:12:09,745
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely two points of view.

129
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:11,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not denying that in the least.

130
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:14,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's an optics, OK?

131
00:12:14,728 --> 00:12:25,593
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other piece of it is that both mayors and all three mayors said, yeah, when you're the chair, it makes you show up.

132
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:32,313
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that there is and that that is a piece that it becomes a priority.

133
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:39,019
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've talked to school committee members from other communities where the mayor is not the chair.

134
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:42,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, and I didn't just talk about that recently.

135
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:51,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about that over years of going down to the conference that we have and said, how is it not having your mayor on?

136
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not just trying to say that from,

137
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:58,375
[SPEAKER_03]: from, oh, I'm responding to this moment in time, I'm thinking about it from a historical.

138
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,937
[SPEAKER_03]: But absolutely, Ron, there's two different viewpoints on all of these.

139
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:04,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Phyllis, you had a point?

140
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Ron, did you say that the mayor sets the agenda?

141
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,761
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I thought the superintendent set the agenda.

142
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:12,022
[SPEAKER_05]: She controls the meeting.

143
00:13:12,362 --> 00:13:18,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, she's in charge of the meeting, so I'm sure that Paulette would know better.

144
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:22,548
[SPEAKER_00]: My understanding was the mayor does set the agenda with the superintendent.

145
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:23,293
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

146
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:43,145
[SPEAKER_03]: The superintendent puts together the agenda and of course she has discussions with the mayor as well as if other committee members and in fact there's a policy that outlines to make sure that other committee members can get their item of interest on an agenda.

147
00:13:44,174 --> 00:13:49,817
[SPEAKER_03]: So the primary responsibility for doing all that work is the superintendent.

148
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:59,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if the mayor doesn't like, you know, if something is missing and they've been asking to put it on, obviously the mayor and or school committee members weigh in.

149
00:14:01,044 --> 00:14:11,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, without any doubt the mayor and the superintendent would talk, but the work, the workload goes to the superintendent and her office staff.

150
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,534
[SPEAKER_03]: So Aubrey has her hand up.

151
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:25,601
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to me that having the mayor as the chair would not change what you just described.

152
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:34,687
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like those conversations would still happen to develop the minutes for the meeting and the topics being considered for that day.

153
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:45,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think right now, we're going to, we don't need to solve this question right this second.

154
00:14:46,262 --> 00:14:50,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should go on to the next item of business, which I think is very important.

155
00:14:51,646 --> 00:14:55,408
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to hit this again later on in the meeting.

156
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:56,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?

157
00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:07,717
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next document, if you would bring it up, is under number three, and that's WRRB brief on changing the Worcester School Committee to district representation.

158
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,673
[SPEAKER_03]: And Milva shared this with me right after our last meeting, and I thought it was very important.

159
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:22,145
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hopefully the committee members have had a chance to take a look at it.

160
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:43,136
[SPEAKER_03]: But in short, as in Lowell, which we had mentioned earlier, but the city of Worcester was facing a potential lawsuit and they needed because and there's a list of the organizations on this document who had

161
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:52,324
[SPEAKER_03]: band together, including the NAACP, individuals, et cetera.

162
00:15:53,302 --> 00:16:01,449
[SPEAKER_03]: and said that the way that the at-large representation did not fairly represent their city.

163
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a summation that I can make to make this brief.

164
00:16:06,234 --> 00:16:13,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of that, just like in Lowell, they negotiated a new

165
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:22,203
[SPEAKER_03]: a way of electing their school committee members.

166
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:27,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did a combination of wards.

167
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:33,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and I forget the exact, if we can scroll down a little bit on this.

168
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:36,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget the exact of what it was.

169
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:50,230
[SPEAKER_03]: We had some of the boundaries of the new school committee districts must contain approximately the same number of residents.

170
00:16:58,857 --> 00:16:59,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

171
00:17:00,038 --> 00:17:01,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there another page to this?

172
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:02,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, three.

173
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,041
[SPEAKER_03]: It's five pages all together.

174
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:05,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

175
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:15,250
[SPEAKER_09]: They talk.

176
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:20,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

177
00:17:21,694 --> 00:17:22,855
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, keep on going, please.

178
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:28,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't remember the exact what it was.

179
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:38,106
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that it was awards and at large was the final, what they decided on and they changed their,

180
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:40,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Districts and districts.

181
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry, wards.

182
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,901
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my question.

183
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:49,004
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, is the district was not as simple as two wards being combined?

184
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:52,346
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think it was a little more complicated.

185
00:17:52,366 --> 00:17:53,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you go to the page?

186
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:57,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I thought it was on this.

187
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:02,532
[SPEAKER_03]: This mentions the low one.

188
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:04,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

189
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, where Lowell now has two at large and four districts.

190
00:18:13,892 --> 00:18:19,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, if I recall, I think Worcester, oh, here it is, to be determined.

191
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,919
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is in here someplace.

192
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:34,109
[SPEAKER_03]: But the real point of this document is that there clearly seems to be a move away from at-large

193
00:18:36,211 --> 00:18:41,115
[SPEAKER_03]: voting to ward representation.

194
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:45,759
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the city council, they're the same at large, correct?

195
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,922
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think they changed their city council too.

196
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm just thinking of the Lowell situation.

197
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:56,368
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Lowell was just school committee, not city council.

198
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:12,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the question that is, if you change the school community to districts, those districts has to also represent the city council in an election, I think.

199
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:13,869
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

200
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:28,357
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, here that, you know, from what came out of the consent decree that came that Worcester, you know, crafted was that

201
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:43,902
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have to align they could, but that was the city council should consider whether to change the city council districts to align with the selection of the school committee that decision is with the cities and not.

202
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:50,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Subject to the consent degree requirements, so it doesn't have to be that said, it doesn't have to be the same.

203
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,149
[SPEAKER_01]: In my view, I think it should be.

204
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:58,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just, let me just throw this in because this is what I get out of this whole thing.

205
00:19:58,971 --> 00:20:05,114
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that through our discussions, we've determined that ward representation is good.

206
00:20:05,254 --> 00:20:06,354
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I interpret this.

207
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:12,838
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the concerns are that adding school committee members may be too much at this time.

208
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:18,301
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought what a compromise scenario could be

209
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:27,795
[SPEAKER_00]: is combining wards as we've talked about, but keeping the wards whole so that the city council would have eight wards that they'll be elected from.

210
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:29,658
[SPEAKER_00]: The school committee would be

211
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:37,811
[SPEAKER_00]: four dual awards, in other words, one and two, three and four.

212
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:44,552
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wrote today to the Secretary of State's Election Division to see if that's possible.

213
00:20:45,373 --> 00:20:51,954
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got an email just a little while ago that says it's moved to somebody else to give us a determination.

214
00:20:52,494 --> 00:20:58,455
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that that kind of answers our concerns that we would have four,

215
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:15,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Ward do award representatives, and we'd have three to at large positions in the mirror, giving us the seven that we have now, but it also gets all eight wards feeling that they have a representative, even though they're sharing it with each other now, whether that's.

216
00:21:16,722 --> 00:21:32,841
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that's the Secretary of State says that's legal makes sense to me because it leaves the city council still the way we designed it with the ward representation of eight wards and it knocks down the school committee to four ward representative positions.

217
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:36,384
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wrote to them, you know, they just, it's a citizen's request.

218
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:38,026
[SPEAKER_00]: They just answer any questions.

219
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:42,469
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was transferred late this afternoon to the election division.

220
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:47,753
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming that they're going to give us some kind of, I asked for guidance as to, is it done?

221
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:48,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it been done?

222
00:21:48,894 --> 00:21:51,196
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the process to make sure we do it correctly?

223
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:56,280
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, in my head, it's, you know, you would have wards that touch each other and then, you know,

224
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one ward in the north, one in the south.

225
00:21:59,023 --> 00:22:01,146
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd want wards that touch each other.

226
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:12,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, and I know we have a map somewhere of wards and the schools in the wards, ideally it would be nice if there was a school in each one of the doubled up wards.

227
00:22:13,461 --> 00:22:14,302
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if that's...

228
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:15,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

229
00:22:15,483 --> 00:22:17,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't necessarily think that works.

230
00:22:17,204 --> 00:22:31,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when we talk about our wording in our document, we're going to hear that every person elected to the school committee is responsible for representing every, you know.

231
00:22:32,094 --> 00:22:32,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

232
00:22:32,494 --> 00:22:35,476
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was just thinking that's a bonus if we had that also.

233
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:35,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

234
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:47,043
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I was kind of thinking of Phyllis, because we were clearly, and Aubrey, I'm not sure where you sat on this, but we were kind of really on the fence.

235
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:55,549
[SPEAKER_03]: We were kind of like, at the last meeting, I said, okay, I'll go along with Ron, and Phyllis still some level of agreed to go along, but some level of,

236
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Discontent.

237
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:04,834
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I read this, I was like, yeah, that just solves it for me.

238
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:09,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Because right now, as soon as I read through this document, I said, okay, look at this.

239
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:11,098
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only a matter of time.

240
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:12,639
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only a matter of time.

241
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:14,280
[SPEAKER_03]: There's Lowell, there's

242
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Springfield, there's Worcester, we're a city, it's only a matter of time.

243
00:23:20,248 --> 00:23:21,931
[SPEAKER_03]: So therefore... I got the same impression.

244
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:24,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so therefore... We're going to be facing this soon.

245
00:23:25,676 --> 00:23:27,359
[SPEAKER_03]: This was like to me, a gift.

246
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,292
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is so clear, I don't have to think about it anymore.

247
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:37,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the next question, which we're going to get to, Ron, is exactly what you just outlined is, okay, how are we going to do it?

248
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:41,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we want to do is we want to move on to the next item, number four.

249
00:23:41,883 --> 00:23:44,285
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it feels like we're barreling through this.

250
00:23:44,405 --> 00:23:44,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

251
00:23:44,766 --> 00:23:47,509
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just passing by.

252
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,751
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't knocked anything out yet.

253
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:51,347
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, don't be so grim.

254
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:54,149
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.

255
00:23:55,349 --> 00:23:57,270
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hit these things and get them out of here.

256
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:02,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so let's go to, in the next piece, I do not want to go to the Collins Center.

257
00:24:03,712 --> 00:24:14,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like you to bring up the document which I submitted, starting with section 4-1, Composition, Terms of Office.

258
00:24:14,896 --> 00:24:16,317
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one is just composition.

259
00:24:16,757 --> 00:24:18,638
[SPEAKER_03]: There's three different pages relating to this.

260
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:21,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

261
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:22,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Composition.

262
00:24:23,017 --> 00:24:27,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

263
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:28,960
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is not it.

264
00:24:30,461 --> 00:24:32,842
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking for 4-1, 4-1-A?

265
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:34,543
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for 4-1.

266
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:39,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I put them in the drive, in the subcommittee folder.

267
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:43,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was, I sent all of the documents to you.

268
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:44,968
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is 4-1-C.

269
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Aubrey, you're getting closer.

270
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:48,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's coming up.

271
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I did send you the links as well.

272
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,052
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is 4-5.

273
00:24:58,312 --> 00:25:08,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I have it, I just can't see the top because it has the controls.

274
00:25:09,938 --> 00:25:17,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible instead of using this link that you could use the link that I sent you in the- I shall find it in a second.

275
00:25:17,971 --> 00:25:19,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, she's got it up now.

276
00:25:19,812 --> 00:25:21,012
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just this is very tiny.

277
00:25:21,032 --> 00:25:22,893
[SPEAKER_03]: She can make them bigger.

278
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:23,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.

279
00:25:23,494 --> 00:25:24,054
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

280
00:25:24,754 --> 00:25:33,399
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, guys, so this is what I did because I find words wordsmithing at a meeting to be extremely difficult, particularly a Zoom meeting.

281
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:43,523
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at each of the sections of the Collins from the three different three different towns that were presented.

282
00:25:43,984 --> 00:25:45,264
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, and

283
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:53,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Using some of their language and some of mine, I then made options for us.

284
00:25:54,734 --> 00:26:00,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the first option that you're gonna see up on number one is what we have.

285
00:26:00,797 --> 00:26:03,438
[SPEAKER_03]: We have already moved off of this, okay?

286
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven members at large.

287
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have options A and B, by the way.

288
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:18,005
[SPEAKER_03]: The mayor shall serve as the seventh member of the school committee by virtue of office and shall have the same powers and duties as the members elected by the voters as school committee members.

289
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:20,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Or B, the member will serve as the seventh member

290
00:26:21,707 --> 00:26:24,389
[SPEAKER_03]: truly in service chair, okay?

291
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:27,911
[SPEAKER_03]: So A and B, we're not going to answer it right now, but that's the difference.

292
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:33,814
[SPEAKER_03]: A and B outlines that question and gives you some language, okay?

293
00:26:34,254 --> 00:26:39,958
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm hearing, let's not get caught into the A and B right now, is option one is off the table.

294
00:26:40,638 --> 00:26:41,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Big red X through it.

295
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:42,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Slash.

296
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,780
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll make one unhappy.

297
00:26:46,161 --> 00:26:47,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you don't actually have to take it up.

298
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:49,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Now,

299
00:26:50,988 --> 00:27:01,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Option two is what Ron just outlined and what I had talked to about with the mayors too, is the Medford School Committee shall consist of seven members who will be elected as follows.

300
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:06,780
[SPEAKER_03]: For the purpose of the school committee elections, four combined wards will be created from the eight wards of the city.

301
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:12,304
[SPEAKER_03]: From each combined ward, one candidate will be elected by the voters of that combined ward.

302
00:27:12,844 --> 00:27:18,929
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, two candidates will be elected at large by the voters of all four combined wards.

303
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:20,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

304
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:25,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

305
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:27,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I can't talk right now.

306
00:27:29,832 --> 00:27:32,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, Melva.

307
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:35,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

308
00:27:36,815 --> 00:27:38,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Paulette, can I ask a quick question?

309
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:40,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

310
00:27:40,836 --> 00:27:43,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And you probably have already discussed this and I may have forgotten.

311
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:48,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we with, can the city combine more?

312
00:27:48,678 --> 00:27:52,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that has to be checked out or is that something you're talking about, Ron?

313
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,961
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I sent the letter about.

314
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:56,421
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what the letter went for, right?

315
00:27:56,521 --> 00:27:57,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I'm clear on this.

316
00:27:57,782 --> 00:27:58,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

317
00:27:59,202 --> 00:27:59,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Milva.

318
00:28:00,302 --> 00:28:03,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Just noting that Milva has joined us.

319
00:28:05,168 --> 00:28:07,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Paulette, can I just ask for a word clarification?

320
00:28:08,371 --> 00:28:08,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

321
00:28:09,011 --> 00:28:17,278
[SPEAKER_00]: The wording that you're using here is saying we're combining going, it kind of implies going down to four wards, which we're not doing.

322
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,383
[SPEAKER_03]: For the purpose of the school committee election.

323
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:29,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, but it's still, it's going to be wards one, two, and wards three, four, and wards five, six, and wards seven and eight.

324
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:30,637
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?

325
00:28:31,097 --> 00:28:31,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

326
00:28:31,338 --> 00:28:36,363
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be a new, it's not going to be, I'm in ward four, I'm in ward one for school committee.

327
00:28:37,404 --> 00:28:38,045
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?

328
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there'll still be separate wards, they'll just be combined for the purposes of the election of the school committee members.

329
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:53,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, I just wanted to be clear that you will be voting for a representative of wards one and two, not a new ward that's called A.

330
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:55,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, absolutely.

331
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:06,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Ron, that kind of detail that you're asking for, I think, would become more clear after we get the response from your outreach today, which is fantastic.

332
00:29:07,216 --> 00:29:18,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the purposes of our discussion, what I was trying to do was outline, hey, choice two, a combined choice three, eight wards.

333
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:24,787
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we may be forced to use choice three, but I understand what you're saying.

334
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:31,789
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to not interfere with the decisions we made on the city council ward rep process.

335
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:32,449
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

336
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:43,791
[SPEAKER_01]: If we do something different, if we stick with ward three, option three, it aligns pretty well with what we've already decided for city council.

337
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:45,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

338
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Option two,

339
00:29:48,758 --> 00:29:57,705
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that, I'm trying, I'm thinking about it from the perspective of the city elections office.

340
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:07,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Would that muck them up in any way, make more work for them, more anything?

341
00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:15,031
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, have things be less streamlined and more opportunity for problems and things like that.

342
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:19,354
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, wondering about it.

343
00:30:19,914 --> 00:30:22,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the answer, but I think it's something.

344
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:25,318
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just make a suggestion on that?

345
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:31,262
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that because of our decisions on the city council, we're already forcing the election committee to change the ballots.

346
00:30:31,782 --> 00:30:39,267
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you walk into your Ward 2-2, you're going to see the candidates on a Ward 2-2 ballot.

347
00:30:39,827 --> 00:30:43,050
[SPEAKER_00]: So the election committee is going to have to do new balloting.

348
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,911
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the process.

349
00:30:46,435 --> 00:30:52,959
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be easier if we did three, I think, where we weren't trying to combine wards.

350
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,720
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be easier.

351
00:30:57,461 --> 00:31:10,669
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we've had some questions about would we have school committee members from every district and from every ward backup.

352
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:18,838
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that these are the perhaps two options that we bring to.

353
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,225
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be based on what we hear from the Secretary of State too.

354
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

355
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:36,795
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are scheduled to have a meeting on the 11th, Thursday, April 11th is when I would like to have our next meeting so that we have another one before the 18th.

356
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:42,298
[SPEAKER_03]: So we might have some feedback by then, allowing us to narrow it down.

357
00:31:43,018 --> 00:31:53,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I would again argue, particularly if we go to three, which mirrors the city council decision, that the mayor should be the chair,

358
00:31:54,383 --> 00:32:02,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Because under that, that would be the only person who is elected by the whole as opposed to just a district.

359
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:13,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So in my personal opinion, I would, again, under number two, I also favor that for the same reason, but under three, it's even more clear.

360
00:32:13,958 --> 00:32:23,542
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't, I'm not going to, I wasn't gonna push for a decision between A and B tonight, but I've outlined them clearly.

361
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:30,304
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we could move on at this point and say, okay, here's option A and option B.

362
00:32:31,803 --> 00:32:35,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, I just want to state my preference here.

363
00:32:35,925 --> 00:32:38,907
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know we're waiting to hear back from the state.

364
00:32:39,808 --> 00:32:53,015
[SPEAKER_05]: But I particularly prefer number two for the simple reason that because we have not had representation from all wards, and we haven't even had people running from every ward.

365
00:32:53,956 --> 00:32:58,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the combined wards, for me, would be the best way to move forward.

366
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:01,240
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my humble opinion.

367
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:11,569
[SPEAKER_07]: And clearly, sorry, I was gonna say just for reference, I put language from the Worcester charter in the chat.

368
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:22,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I was also trying to look up Lowell because we know Lowell, Worcester and Springfield are the communities that we know of that do this with their school committee.

369
00:33:24,521 --> 00:33:28,885
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is how they word it, six district members and two members elected at large.

370
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:34,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I imagine somewhere else in the charter, they might define district, but I don't know.

371
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:46,696
[SPEAKER_00]: The only, Melva, we had touched on that before you came in, but the only concern is that how does that impact, if we're establishing districts, how does that impact the city council side of the vote?

372
00:33:46,896 --> 00:33:49,178
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it has to.

373
00:33:49,538 --> 00:33:55,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Lowell does this, and they have eight wards, same as we do, and they have four,

374
00:33:56,778 --> 00:34:01,822
[SPEAKER_07]: district, you know, with the combined wards, two at large and the mayor for their school.

375
00:34:01,922 --> 00:34:07,025
[SPEAKER_00]: And their districts are also not necessarily in line with wards.

376
00:34:08,026 --> 00:34:11,709
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they, what they've done is combined two wards to make those districts.

377
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:13,630
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's how they did it.

378
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:18,794
[SPEAKER_07]: And their city council is eight, eight ward members, three at large.

379
00:34:18,994 --> 00:34:21,095
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't, they don't do it for city council.

380
00:34:21,135 --> 00:34:22,336
[SPEAKER_07]: They do it for school committee.

381
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:22,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm.

382
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:34,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And Springfield and Worcester, I can't remember which is which, but one of them does do it for both city council and school committee, but the other one also does it only for school committee and not city council.

383
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:40,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think, you know, in this regard, it doesn't have to be the same.

384
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:48,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when people go to the polls, they'll just get the ballot with their candidates on it.

385
00:34:48,604 --> 00:34:53,131
[SPEAKER_03]: We just would have to make sure that the right ballots got to the right polls.

386
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:57,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it's more of a function of teaching the election committee how to create the ballots.

387
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:06,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think they do that anyway with like this year, we're going to be electing our state reps.

388
00:35:06,935 --> 00:35:10,618
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Donato and Barber.

389
00:35:10,638 --> 00:35:11,638
[SPEAKER_00]: Different areas, right?

390
00:35:11,678 --> 00:35:11,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

391
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:17,962
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, Barber is my rep, so I would get the ballot with her on it.

392
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:23,726
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're over, you know, maybe Ron in your world, you get Donato on your ballot.

393
00:35:24,366 --> 00:35:24,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

394
00:35:27,284 --> 00:35:30,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron, did I hear that you were going to call the Secretary of State to ask about this?

395
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:46,452
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote an email to the Secretary of State yesterday, got a response today that's moved over to the election division about this question of how easy it is to create either combining wards and calling them wards one and two, three and four, or creating districts and how does that impact.

396
00:35:46,472 --> 00:35:47,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm waiting to hear.

397
00:35:47,373 --> 00:35:52,415
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked for process and is it, you know, I asked for a lot of questions.

398
00:35:53,145 --> 00:36:03,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that when I spoke with the city clerk in Lowell, I was told that in order to do it in Lowell, they hired a consultant.

399
00:36:04,408 --> 00:36:10,570
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I noticed that on that Worcester newsletter, they said that they hired the same consultant Lowell did.

400
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:19,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the reasons that I was told they needed to hire a consultant was because you have to make sure that your combinations of wards

401
00:36:20,229 --> 00:36:22,289
[SPEAKER_09]: are in line with the law, right?

402
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:29,511
[SPEAKER_07]: But they also had issues, both Worcester and Lowell were responding to lawsuits.

403
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:49,354
[SPEAKER_07]: So they also, so I don't know how much of the expertise of the consultant was needed for the combination of the wards or making sure that the representation would be, you know, with the different groups was covered.

404
00:36:50,018 --> 00:36:50,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

405
00:36:51,678 --> 00:36:56,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's just wait and see what the guidance they give us.

406
00:36:56,479 --> 00:37:07,821
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we, and just to, in the desire to, you know, gain agreement on all these things, I can support the mayor being the chairperson.

407
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:15,363
[SPEAKER_00]: If everybody else does, let's just check it off as, it seems like there's consensus here that the mayor should be the chairperson.

408
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,482
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I think I can support that.

409
00:37:21,303 --> 00:37:22,544
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's great.

410
00:37:24,105 --> 00:37:25,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of coming around to it.

411
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:29,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't necessarily think we're voting on these.

412
00:37:29,643 --> 00:37:33,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we're agreeing that one is out and two and three with the options are there.

413
00:37:35,688 --> 00:37:47,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly understand the need for potentially detailing the combination of the wards down the line, but I think right now it gives us language that is clear.

414
00:37:49,378 --> 00:37:50,019
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys agree?

415
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:50,959
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

416
00:37:51,059 --> 00:37:51,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Agree.

417
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,242
[SPEAKER_03]: We're taking two and three to the full group.

418
00:37:55,143 --> 00:37:55,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

419
00:37:56,208 --> 00:38:00,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's go on to the next page, which is term of office.

420
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:06,052
[SPEAKER_03]: And on this page, I gave you three options.

421
00:38:06,132 --> 00:38:12,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Term of the office, and you noticed I put 6-8 because it depended on, you know, it built upon the last one.

422
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:15,016
[SPEAKER_03]: School committee members elected by the voters shall be two years.

423
00:38:15,816 --> 00:38:17,357
[SPEAKER_03]: The next choice is four years.

424
00:38:18,037 --> 00:38:19,798
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third is staggered terms.

425
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:33,133
[SPEAKER_03]: term of office for the six or eight school committee members elected by the voters shall be four years each beginning on the first business day of January in the year following their November election until the successors are qualified.

426
00:38:33,614 --> 00:38:42,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Terms of office shall be arranged so that half of the six or eight school committee members are elected by annuity.

427
00:38:43,223 --> 00:39:00,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Note, in the case of wards, half the wards and half of at-large members elected biannually, the first time it's put into place, some arrangement would need to be made so that one half of those elected serve for two years and stand for election again, while the remaining half have a four-year term.

428
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:07,644
[SPEAKER_03]: If eight wards and four-year terms, half of the wards would begin with two-year terms, while the other half would have four-year terms.

429
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:08,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's two

430
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:09,666
[SPEAKER_03]: just trying to clarify.

431
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:20,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I talked to school committee members from other places that had initiated staggered terms, they said they had worked out some kind of way.

432
00:39:20,296 --> 00:39:32,687
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first time that they initiated it, they came to some agreement on who would serve two years and who would serve four years in order to set the cycle.

433
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we haven't talked that much about staggered terms.

434
00:39:36,783 --> 00:39:40,806
[SPEAKER_03]: We certainly have gone back and forth from the two years, four years.

435
00:39:41,086 --> 00:39:45,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't put three years in here because we've said, hey, it's interesting, but we don't know if we want to do it.

436
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,811
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we want to.

437
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:56,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly, we saw staggered terms mentioned in some writing

438
00:39:57,582 --> 00:40:11,726
[SPEAKER_03]: It means, as Eunice pointed out at the last meeting, if you would, currently two of our current school committee members, two out of six of our current school committee members have served before.

439
00:40:12,146 --> 00:40:16,607
[SPEAKER_03]: But at this point, just two months into the year, four of them are new.

440
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:18,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a pretty new school committee.

441
00:40:19,468 --> 00:40:20,768
[SPEAKER_03]: So stack of terms might.

442
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:25,892
[SPEAKER_03]: might work, I definitely think it makes it more confusing.

443
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:34,880
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not solve the issue that the superintendent had talked to us about, about always having the potential for new.

444
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:45,650
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that it anticipates is if you have your whole board turning over at once, that's the only thing.

445
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,471
[SPEAKER_03]: So,

446
00:40:48,152 --> 00:40:49,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years, four years, you're staggered.

447
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:52,196
[SPEAKER_03]: What are people thinking on this one?

448
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not four.

449
00:40:58,042 --> 00:40:59,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, four is out.

450
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:06,070
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you don't like four, then you're not going to like staggered either.

451
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:07,731
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that is four.

452
00:41:08,452 --> 00:41:09,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's four.

453
00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:27,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So are we all saying, you know, if we're changing to ward or combination, we are lessening for, if it's all ward, it definitely makes it easier for somebody to run, okay?

454
00:41:28,425 --> 00:41:30,947
[SPEAKER_03]: So it definitely makes it easier for somebody to run in a ward.

455
00:41:31,787 --> 00:41:34,970
[SPEAKER_03]: So because of that, they can just have two-year terms.

456
00:41:36,255 --> 00:41:38,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Just my opinion on four years.

457
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:42,337
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that in the first term, four years, you want to have four years.

458
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:47,779
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the second term and third term where you may want to get out in 10, you have to stick till 12.

459
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,879
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that can become an issue.

460
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:57,942
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we resolve the ability to have multiple terms because of the fact that we're in wards.

461
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:10,592
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that you have a smaller campaign, the people know you, the likelihood should be that a good school committee person should be able to walk right through to the next term.

462
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:21,560
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same is true if it's not a performing school committee person to the standards, the community can say thanks, but, you know, we're looking up, we're going to look elsewhere.

463
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,021
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I like the two.

464
00:42:23,902 --> 00:42:27,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, I keep going back to what the superintendent said.

465
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:30,448
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what keeps coming up in my mind.

466
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:44,016
[SPEAKER_05]: What a challenge it is for the superintendent, you know, with people, you know, being initiated the first year and then getting their, you know, getting their footing in the second year, and then they're gone again if they don't run or are reelected.

467
00:42:45,837 --> 00:42:49,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps four years is too much, and I don't think there's an option for three, so.

468
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,523
[SPEAKER_05]: But I still have that sense of, you know,

469
00:42:59,428 --> 00:43:02,872
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hear what Phyllis is saying, I absolutely do.

470
00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:09,640
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem that, you know, the superintendent is having with this, you know, I mean, I think it's a real issue.

471
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we solve it?

472
00:43:10,941 --> 00:43:11,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

473
00:43:11,642 --> 00:43:14,225
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally would have liked three years.

474
00:43:14,285 --> 00:43:15,206
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not an option.

475
00:43:15,938 --> 00:43:26,623
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think, though, that the fact that we're in ward scenarios gives the school committee person a better chance to renew every two years.

476
00:43:26,643 --> 00:43:30,926
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that kind of answers the superintendent's concern.

477
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:31,806
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?

478
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:33,367
[SPEAKER_05]: If they want, that's the issue.

479
00:43:34,167 --> 00:43:35,988
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the case.

480
00:43:36,468 --> 00:43:37,569
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the case anyways.

481
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,470
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you can't get them to

482
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:51,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the point I'm trying to make is I just wish it was a longer term overall, perhaps four years, like you're saying, when you know, after you're in two terms that you get into 12, that's a lot.

483
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:57,284
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just thinking about the efficiency of working with the superintendent and people not having to come up.

484
00:43:57,744 --> 00:44:06,851
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're making the assumption and I'm making the assumption that if someone runs and is elected and is in there for two years, then they're going to want to run and be reelected again.

485
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:08,272
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not always the case.

486
00:44:08,872 --> 00:44:11,474
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have people who want to stay, that's perfect.

487
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,976
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's excessive turnover.

488
00:44:14,256 --> 00:44:19,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, look, even this year, unfortunately, someone had to resign for an issue.

489
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Those things happen, you know?

490
00:44:21,181 --> 00:44:25,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, you know, I just, for me, it's not an alternative.

491
00:44:26,025 --> 00:44:27,526
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have preferred the three years.

492
00:44:27,806 --> 00:44:28,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

493
00:44:28,106 --> 00:44:36,512
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody, everybody, I'm just saying, though, Phyllis, is that if I'm in a four-year term and I don't want to do it after two years, I'm still in the same boat.

494
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:37,093
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really,

495
00:44:37,973 --> 00:44:40,176
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't make them stay another two years.

496
00:44:40,196 --> 00:44:43,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, at least you know prestiges and practices and... No, no, no.

497
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:51,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying if somebody doesn't want to be on the school committee, the length of term is not going to dictate, you know, you don't have to stay.

498
00:44:52,555 --> 00:45:10,910
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, there is one other option, which since we put out the combined ward possibility, and that is that the people who are elected from the four combined wards would be elected for two years, but the two candidates who are at large be elected for four.

499
00:45:12,244 --> 00:45:14,727
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to complicate the soup a little bit.

500
00:45:14,747 --> 00:45:16,088
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tough one.

501
00:45:16,348 --> 00:45:18,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to throw another noodle in the pot there, Paula.

502
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:20,713
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, because why not?

503
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:32,185
[SPEAKER_01]: My thought is, like Phyllis, I keep going back to what the superintendent said as well, and I completely understand her point.

504
00:45:32,865 --> 00:45:35,228
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also of the mind that, you know,

505
00:45:37,403 --> 00:45:41,586
[SPEAKER_01]: After two years, prove yourself, or at least give us an indication of what you're going to do.

506
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:50,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like the opportunity to move you along if you're not up to my standards.

507
00:45:50,991 --> 00:45:59,957
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, well, given what the super said, I wish we could get

508
00:46:01,235 --> 00:46:06,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I wonder how other supers in other communities feel.

509
00:46:06,882 --> 00:46:09,145
[SPEAKER_01]: You've only had 2 supers in what?

510
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:09,946
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 years.

511
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:12,769
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so that's her opinion.

512
00:46:12,789 --> 00:46:13,910
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know what.

513
00:46:14,726 --> 00:46:28,432
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Bell's opinion was- I can tell you what Roy's opinion is that he did not find it perhaps as onerous just because many of the same school committee members were elected time after time.

514
00:46:29,713 --> 00:46:30,973
[SPEAKER_03]: After time, after time.

515
00:46:31,534 --> 00:46:32,754
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wasn't, watch it.

516
00:46:32,814 --> 00:46:37,076
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't as, you know, we always had change on the committee.

517
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,772
[SPEAKER_03]: but not as much change as has occurred this year.

518
00:46:45,792 --> 00:46:50,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's definitely been more turnover in the past few years.

519
00:46:50,176 --> 00:46:55,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that might settle out again.

520
00:46:56,222 --> 00:46:56,662
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

521
00:46:56,982 --> 00:46:59,264
[SPEAKER_03]: It might settle out again, yeah.

522
00:46:59,284 --> 00:47:06,191
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be just her opinion, and another super that rolls along in a few years might feel entirely differently.

523
00:47:06,471 --> 00:47:06,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

524
00:47:07,052 --> 00:47:07,192
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron?

525
00:47:08,082 --> 00:47:09,083
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have two points.

526
00:47:09,223 --> 00:47:17,375
[SPEAKER_00]: First is the desire to go to ward representation will answer a lot of the superintendent's concerns.

527
00:47:17,956 --> 00:47:23,705
[SPEAKER_00]: It will keep a fresh face in there that is based on local representatives

528
00:47:24,489 --> 00:47:28,051
[SPEAKER_00]: being voted on, those are the folks that really have the say.

529
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:31,774
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll have the power to extend or they'll have the power to end.

530
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:35,236
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that will answer itself.

531
00:47:35,276 --> 00:47:44,642
[SPEAKER_00]: The second point I have to make is that I just don't know the legality of having school committee people with different lengths of terms.

532
00:47:45,322 --> 00:47:46,563
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the legality of that.

533
00:47:47,353 --> 00:47:48,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that it happens.

534
00:47:48,894 --> 00:47:51,975
[SPEAKER_03]: I've certainly talked to school committees that have whatever.

535
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,376
[SPEAKER_03]: But look, maybe that's complicating it too much.

536
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:58,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, perspective of a candidate, two years is too short.

537
00:47:59,178 --> 00:48:01,840
[SPEAKER_03]: From a perspective of a voter, two years

538
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:11,124
[SPEAKER_03]: gives us the opportunity to oversee, you know, to have change and- And three is not an option.

539
00:48:11,244 --> 00:48:11,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Or control.

540
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:15,306
[SPEAKER_03]: From the perspective of the superintendent, it's not so great.

541
00:48:15,646 --> 00:48:21,589
[SPEAKER_03]: But who are we trying to- who are we trying to do this charter for?

542
00:48:21,629 --> 00:48:26,551
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just for the superintendent, no matter how much I might- For all citizens.

543
00:48:27,191 --> 00:48:28,071
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for the citizens.

544
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:28,732
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

545
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:29,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

546
00:48:29,492 --> 00:48:31,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So from a citizen viewpoint,

547
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:40,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, the city council, then the mayor puts their approval on whatever we provide.

548
00:48:40,532 --> 00:48:41,472
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taken care of.

549
00:48:41,593 --> 00:48:44,714
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the voters, it's the citizens who don't need a voice.

550
00:48:44,774 --> 00:48:45,615
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who we are.

551
00:48:48,116 --> 00:48:50,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Would we like to throw out staggered terms?

552
00:48:52,737 --> 00:49:02,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that just sound just one level more, Paul will be sad, but how many of these do we bring forward?

553
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:13,697
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like- I think that for the simplicity and for consistency, I find myself

554
00:49:14,717 --> 00:49:20,141
[SPEAKER_05]: because of the limited, they're not limited options, that's not what I mean, because of the two choices in front of me.

555
00:49:20,742 --> 00:49:33,151
[SPEAKER_05]: I would probably say that the most effective, or the people in the wards, like someone just said, the superintendent's one person, it would probably be best not to have staggered terms and to do it for two years.

556
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:36,934
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I'm leaning right now.

557
00:49:37,655 --> 00:49:38,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Quiet, Ms.

558
00:49:38,355 --> 00:49:39,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Aubrey, what do you think?

559
00:49:41,197 --> 00:49:41,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, Aubrey.

560
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:46,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been a two-year fan for most of my time on this subcommittee.

561
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:50,730
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying you've changed your mind?

562
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Two.

563
00:49:52,371 --> 00:49:53,151
[SPEAKER_03]: No, she's still there.

564
00:49:53,251 --> 00:49:53,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Two.

565
00:49:53,431 --> 00:49:53,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Two.

566
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:54,431
[SPEAKER_02]: She's two.

567
00:49:54,912 --> 00:49:56,192
[SPEAKER_02]: She's the two-year camp.

568
00:49:57,252 --> 00:49:57,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

569
00:49:57,592 --> 00:50:00,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we have a general consensus.

570
00:50:00,173 --> 00:50:02,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all would like three, and that's a side paper.

571
00:50:02,674 --> 00:50:03,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

572
00:50:04,715 --> 00:50:07,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that staggered terms is interesting but complicated.

573
00:50:07,676 --> 00:50:09,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I hear a consensus around two.

574
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you do.

575
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:12,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

576
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,201
[SPEAKER_03]: So could we put a check next to that one?

577
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:16,401
[SPEAKER_03]: We can put a flag on that.

578
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:18,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

579
00:50:18,622 --> 00:50:30,405
[SPEAKER_05]: While we're at it, I think I pretty well hear a consensus that we all are in agreement, at least tentatively, I think, that the mayor should chair the school committee.

580
00:50:30,605 --> 00:50:32,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Phyllis, did you just freeze?

581
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:34,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know.

582
00:50:36,012 --> 00:50:38,234
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody just froze for a second on mine.

583
00:50:38,694 --> 00:50:38,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

584
00:50:38,955 --> 00:50:45,840
[SPEAKER_05]: What I was saying was, I think that you have some consensus here also on the fact that the mayor should chair the school committee.

585
00:50:49,063 --> 00:50:49,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

586
00:50:50,804 --> 00:50:51,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Aubrey's head shaking.

587
00:50:52,806 --> 00:50:53,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Eunice?

588
00:50:55,308 --> 00:50:57,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

589
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:57,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

590
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,791
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still a little unclear.

591
00:51:00,437 --> 00:51:02,399
[SPEAKER_03]: But perhaps moving towards that.

592
00:51:02,959 --> 00:51:03,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

593
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,882
[SPEAKER_05]: I was highly opposed to it originally, but.

594
00:51:08,043 --> 00:51:17,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, the way that I see it is since I've moved to wards or combined wards over to Ron's camp, and he's now graciously moved over to my camp.

595
00:51:17,531 --> 00:51:23,456
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, remember, remember, we're going to have to we're going to offer both these to the committee of the whole.

596
00:51:23,556 --> 00:51:24,356
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's right.

597
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:25,718
[SPEAKER_00]: Both and both in play.

598
00:51:25,758 --> 00:51:28,500
[SPEAKER_00]: We make a recommendation that says what we want, but.

599
00:51:29,225 --> 00:51:29,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's see.

600
00:51:30,026 --> 00:51:41,214
[SPEAKER_05]: The tipping point for me on this was that I now know definitively that the superintendent does set the agenda, the map that controls the meeting.

601
00:51:42,395 --> 00:51:46,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, to me, is really what made my mind change on that.

602
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:47,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

603
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:53,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we go on to number 41C, eligibility?

604
00:51:53,224 --> 00:51:53,244
[SPEAKER_03]: 41C.

605
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:05,806
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually, I have a word wrong in this, but at large eligibility.

606
00:52:06,387 --> 00:52:11,012
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not talking about at large for warden eligibility.

607
00:52:11,032 --> 00:52:12,714
[SPEAKER_09]: That's number two.

608
00:52:13,455 --> 00:52:15,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm going to paragraph two.

609
00:52:17,086 --> 00:52:30,947
[SPEAKER_03]: A school committee candidate shall at the time of election be a Medford voter and shall have resided in the ward they wish to represent as calculated from the previous year to submitting nomination papers for the office of school committee.

610
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I don't know if that's very clear.

611
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:42,656
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm trying to say is, in my opinion, I was saying that you have to be a voter, a Medford voter.

612
00:52:43,657 --> 00:52:50,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are representing a ward, you had to live in that ward for a year.

613
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:54,443
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to define a year from when.

614
00:52:55,524 --> 00:53:00,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it a year from the time a person submits their nomination papers.

615
00:53:01,585 --> 00:53:04,908
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm Paulette Vander Kloot and I live in Ward 6.

616
00:53:05,848 --> 00:53:07,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to run for school committee.

617
00:53:08,771 --> 00:53:19,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to demonstrate in some way that I lived in Ward 6 one year previous to my submitting of nomination papers.

618
00:53:19,759 --> 00:53:23,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that rule also for living in Medford one year?

619
00:53:27,525 --> 00:53:29,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you live in the ward, you'd live in Medford.

620
00:53:31,622 --> 00:53:34,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but if you lived in Medford, you wouldn't necessarily live in the ward.

621
00:53:34,285 --> 00:53:41,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you have to live in the ward.

622
00:53:41,691 --> 00:53:43,733
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying living in the ward for a year.

623
00:53:44,574 --> 00:53:44,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

624
00:53:46,095 --> 00:53:47,517
[SPEAKER_02]: If they are representing the ward.

625
00:53:47,537 --> 00:53:48,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.

626
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,059
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess I don't.

627
00:53:52,427 --> 00:53:54,610
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I don't want to restrict the voters in that ward.

628
00:53:54,670 --> 00:54:09,888
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody comes in and makes an impact in a ward that has zero representation and nobody really is excited about becoming a school committee person, isn't it up to the voters of that ward to decide whether that person is going to represent them or not?

629
00:54:11,225 --> 00:54:14,949
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not crazy about the one year rule.

630
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:16,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's what I'm saying.

631
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:20,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of the platform that people run on is where they live.

632
00:54:20,896 --> 00:54:24,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Saying I'm from here becomes part of my platform.

633
00:54:25,586 --> 00:54:37,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just the simple fact that the ward votes for you and you live in that ward, I don't know if it necessarily means do you become a better citizen after one year than you did in the first four months.

634
00:54:38,598 --> 00:54:39,299
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm saying.

635
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:42,402
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's just that one year requirement just doesn't seem...

636
00:54:44,022 --> 00:54:53,064
[SPEAKER_03]: In the Worcester paper, which I, that we went through earlier, there was a one-year requirement living in the ward.

637
00:54:54,365 --> 00:54:56,665
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was part of what I put in.

638
00:54:56,685 --> 00:55:07,367
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I just don't want... So let's say that Paulette Vandeclude is in Ward 3 and her family decides to move to Ward 4.

639
00:55:07,908 --> 00:55:09,848
[SPEAKER_00]: She cannot be part of the school committee anymore?

640
00:55:13,806 --> 00:55:28,180
[SPEAKER_00]: If she's a 20-year school committee person that lived in Ward 3 and her family decides to move to Ward 4, even all the experience she has in the school committee, she cannot run for a year in Ward 4.

641
00:55:30,983 --> 00:55:32,124
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an interesting question.

642
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:46,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that if you're doing ward representation, isn't the idea of ward representation that you are- Who decides who the best ward representation is?

643
00:55:46,397 --> 00:55:46,998
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the voter.

644
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:50,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm looking at this a couple of different ways.

645
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:59,748
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at, let's look at our current processes for running for office where

646
00:56:00,828 --> 00:56:09,433
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, traditionally candidates of, you know, nomination papers come available, you know, for argument's sake, let's call it June 1st.

647
00:56:10,254 --> 00:56:10,694
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

648
00:56:10,714 --> 00:56:18,659
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, June 2nd, somebody I want to go in and pull papers to run for school committee.

649
00:56:21,884 --> 00:56:25,425
[SPEAKER_01]: is regarding the residency requirement.

650
00:56:27,706 --> 00:56:31,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lived in Ward 4 all my life and I'm running in Ward 4.

651
00:56:32,007 --> 00:56:33,948
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.

652
00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:41,550
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I'm a brand new resident to Medford and I moved in?

653
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:45,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'd been a school committee member in, I don't know,

654
00:56:48,328 --> 00:56:49,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Melrose.

655
00:56:49,468 --> 00:56:51,049
[SPEAKER_01]: Melrose, where I used to live.

656
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:55,290
[SPEAKER_01]: But now my family's moved to Medford, and I moved in.

657
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:58,111
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of understand school committees.

658
00:56:58,411 --> 00:57:01,412
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got kids I've just enrolled in the system or whatever.

659
00:57:02,272 --> 00:57:07,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And I moved in in March and settled in my house in Ward 4.

660
00:57:07,774 --> 00:57:10,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean that I can't pull papers?

661
00:57:11,382 --> 00:57:29,723
[SPEAKER_01]: in June, but on the flip side, going to what you guys were just saying, what if I've been renting in Ward 1 for the past five years and finally was able to buy a house in Ward 4?

662
00:57:35,049 --> 00:57:37,691
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a Medford resident for maybe 10 years.

663
00:57:37,752 --> 00:57:49,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been renting in Medford for 10 years, and now I've finally been able to buy a house in Ward 4, or maybe I've got a better apartment over in Ward 4 than I did in Ward 1, and I'm still renting.

664
00:57:51,523 --> 00:57:53,265
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just putting scenarios.

665
00:57:53,565 --> 00:57:55,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody grow up in New York?

666
00:57:56,726 --> 00:57:57,947
[SPEAKER_03]: No, so I might be the only one.

667
00:57:57,987 --> 00:58:10,635
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm thinking, you know, one of the things that we've seen certain presidential candidates do is all of a sudden they move to a different state because they have a better chance of being elected in that state.

668
00:58:12,256 --> 00:58:19,359
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and people slide around, which, you know, again, I remember Hillary Clinton did it in New York, and there was an outro.

669
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:28,962
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess that when I see ward representation, I expect that the person to have some familiarity with the ward that they're representing.

670
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want them necessarily just sliding around.

671
00:58:33,103 --> 00:58:34,325
[SPEAKER_03]: This may be my preference.

672
00:58:34,705 --> 00:58:38,310
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't hear that people are with me on this.

673
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, you know, that's fine.

674
00:58:40,813 --> 00:58:43,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you've raised some really interesting scenarios.

675
00:58:43,116 --> 00:58:46,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that they should be a Medford citizen for a year, Paula?

676
00:58:47,577 --> 00:58:48,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally do.

677
00:58:49,937 --> 00:58:50,898
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

678
00:58:51,018 --> 00:58:55,559
[SPEAKER_00]: I would lean towards that piece from not being a complete outsider.

679
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:59,699
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, the ward thing is the responsibility of the voters.

680
00:59:00,759 --> 00:59:02,300
[SPEAKER_05]: We have at large.

681
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,681
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the purpose, and I could be absolutely wrong.

682
00:59:08,721 --> 00:59:14,162
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding is that we want ward representation so that people in that ward

683
00:59:14,907 --> 00:59:23,531
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've said it several times, and other people have said it, because they know that person in the ward, that there would not be that much cost for campaigning.

684
00:59:23,551 --> 00:59:25,372
[SPEAKER_05]: They're close to the people in that ward.

685
00:59:26,213 --> 00:59:30,655
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, it only makes sense if we're going to go to this two years.

686
00:59:30,755 --> 00:59:39,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't imagine why now, all of a sudden, I would want to now say that, OK, well, I want someone from my ward to represent me.

687
00:59:41,205 --> 00:59:43,707
[SPEAKER_05]: But now it doesn't matter to me.

688
00:59:43,727 --> 00:59:45,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I have all at large then.

689
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:46,410
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you, Phyllis.

690
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,933
[SPEAKER_00]: My only point is it's not for us to say that.

691
00:59:50,034 --> 00:59:52,456
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for the people in the ward to say that.

692
00:59:52,836 --> 00:59:59,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say your sister lives in Ward 4, and you moved in from Melrose, and people love you.

693
00:59:59,723 --> 01:00:00,524
[SPEAKER_00]: They think you're great.

694
01:00:00,544 --> 01:00:01,424
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got great ideas.

695
01:00:01,444 --> 01:00:03,466
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on the Parents Teachers Association.

696
01:00:03,546 --> 01:00:05,949
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've only been in the city nine months.

697
01:00:06,911 --> 01:00:12,355
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I want you, I can't vote for you because of the one-year rule.

698
01:00:12,876 --> 01:00:14,577
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems very arbitrary to me.

699
01:00:14,817 --> 01:00:21,422
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole goal of the ward representation is to make it simplistic so you know you have a representative.

700
01:00:22,062 --> 01:00:25,025
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to take advantage of that, I hear what you're saying.

701
01:00:25,045 --> 01:00:29,468
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to take advantage, then shame on the voters, but give them the right to do it.

702
01:00:30,063 --> 01:00:46,091
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think that as an educator and as a parent who long ago had children in schools, I mean, if someone wants to be on the school committee, I think they should have at least a year's familiarity with the city or the ward.

703
01:00:47,072 --> 01:00:52,114
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they should get to know how things are here or things like that.

704
01:00:54,581 --> 01:00:57,983
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm totally in favor of one year, and I believe they should live in the ward.

705
01:00:58,203 --> 01:01:01,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's my stand on that.

706
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:05,267
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you, living in Medford for a year and understanding, I agree.

707
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:13,311
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not understanding why somebody, you have to live in that ward, because it's the people in that ward who are picking you.

708
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:15,132
[SPEAKER_00]: So you assume that.

709
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:18,373
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take for people to like a representative?

710
01:01:18,433 --> 01:01:20,715
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it six months, nine months?

711
01:01:20,735 --> 01:01:22,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've been forcing it to be a year plus.

712
01:01:23,376 --> 01:01:25,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Arbitrarily, I just don't that that's the part.

713
01:01:25,697 --> 01:01:26,758
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I understand.

714
01:01:26,778 --> 01:01:44,607
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to somebody from Worcester to come in here and run for school committee when they haven't been here six two months however, I I think that The once you're eligible by being a medford citizen for a year, that's a restriction I can support The ward thing is up.

715
01:01:44,787 --> 01:01:45,567
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the whole point.

716
01:01:45,607 --> 01:01:48,109
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to the people of the ward and if you don't have a

717
01:01:48,949 --> 01:01:54,175
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we talk a lot about the fact that maybe there won't be somebody running in a given ward.

718
01:01:54,636 --> 01:01:58,900
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're saying the person who's running, if they're only here nine months, they can't run.

719
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:00,582
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would not want to put them on the ward.

720
01:02:00,602 --> 01:02:08,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the other thing, too, is I hope we can run, and I hope we get the go ahead for this option, is I hope we can do the combining of the wards.

721
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:11,034
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that, you know, yeah, I agree.

722
01:02:11,234 --> 01:02:11,794
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.

723
01:02:12,034 --> 01:02:14,276
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree 100% and it's not going to be easy.

724
01:02:14,757 --> 01:02:15,577
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that regard.

725
01:02:16,598 --> 01:02:18,920
[SPEAKER_00]: To you, Paul, as the chairperson.

726
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:24,104
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in now, and if we're combining 2 words together.

727
01:02:25,514 --> 01:02:31,700
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of would like throw away, why do we need to, why do you need a year in one of the other wards?

728
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:37,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fine with changing this to living in Medford for a year.

729
01:02:37,046 --> 01:02:38,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm okay with that.

730
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:41,250
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if there's a Massachusetts law that demands that.

731
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:41,750
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

732
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:48,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we're up to me, the residency requirements for all of our elected officials would be several years.

733
01:02:49,584 --> 01:02:54,105
[SPEAKER_01]: not just, you know, a year at all.

734
01:02:54,565 --> 01:02:57,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's harder to put it for more than a year.

735
01:02:57,766 --> 01:02:58,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

736
01:02:59,186 --> 01:03:00,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Looked at other stuff.

737
01:03:00,887 --> 01:03:05,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would say that for a city council member, I would also think they should live in Medford for a year.

738
01:03:06,308 --> 01:03:08,728
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know whether that language is stipulated.

739
01:03:08,748 --> 01:03:10,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.

740
01:03:10,809 --> 01:03:15,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there also language that says that in order to run for a ward, I have to live in that ward?

741
01:03:17,425 --> 01:03:23,251
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, there is language because it says that if you leave that ward, you vacate your office.

742
01:03:23,911 --> 01:03:29,877
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's... So it's Medford for a year and a current resident when I file papers of the ward.

743
01:03:29,897 --> 01:03:31,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the two requirements.

744
01:03:31,759 --> 01:03:37,485
[SPEAKER_00]: And at any point when you leave that ward, at that moment, you vacate your office.

745
01:03:38,005 --> 01:03:40,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so a current resident makes sense.

746
01:03:41,228 --> 01:03:44,214
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that there was something in or we were.

747
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:51,727
[SPEAKER_01]: It was either in some of the other charters that we've looked at, maybe Melvin can help me out here, or maybe it's over in the legislative.

748
01:03:53,753 --> 01:04:19,428
[SPEAKER_01]: what the legislative group did, Article 2, that if they vacated from, let's say I'm in Ward 4 and I've got three months or six months left in my term, and I move to Ward 3, and Ward 3 already has its representative, but I'm nearing the end of my term, I stay as,

749
01:04:20,562 --> 01:04:34,168
[SPEAKER_01]: the ward representative for ward, wherever I just said I started out, ward four or whatever, that, you know, there wouldn't be a reason to vacate so close to the end of a term.

750
01:04:35,048 --> 01:04:36,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Milford, do you agree with that?

751
01:04:36,949 --> 01:04:40,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, but that does sound, I mean, we would have to check it, but that does sound.

752
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:47,133
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought in some of the literature that Paul had sent out, that it instantly happens that when you leave the ward, you vacate your office.

753
01:04:47,511 --> 01:04:50,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what was in the other towns.

754
01:04:50,552 --> 01:04:51,593
[SPEAKER_00]: Other towns, yes.

755
01:04:51,633 --> 01:05:00,136
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess I'm assuming that that's also, you know, that document that you linked with the Massachusetts School Committee group that has all the charters in there.

756
01:05:01,036 --> 01:05:03,877
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was in there as well in terms of that.

757
01:05:03,997 --> 01:05:09,439
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of was a, you know, sometimes Medford was used in that, sometimes it's not.

758
01:05:09,459 --> 01:05:11,540
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just obviously general laws.

759
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,501
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would need to check general laws on that.

760
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:16,462
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm pretty, I thought I read that it's an instant vacation.

761
01:05:17,375 --> 01:05:18,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I read that somewhere too, Ron.

762
01:05:18,935 --> 01:05:20,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I did read that somewhere.

763
01:05:20,776 --> 01:05:21,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

764
01:05:21,556 --> 01:05:21,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

765
01:05:21,816 --> 01:05:31,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything that I had read in the different options of the towns that we had received in the Collins Center comparison document said that, which is why I included it.

766
01:05:37,373 --> 01:06:02,978
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm fine with Ron's, you know, I guess the question is when we say that they're Medford voter, I had said from the year of submitting nomination papers, because as opposed to the election, because I don't want someone- When's the deadline for submitting papers, Paula?

767
01:06:06,793 --> 01:06:18,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the election, it is you pick up your papers in June, sometime in June, sometime in July, you have you submit them and they're certified.

768
01:06:18,401 --> 01:06:22,244
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's usually around mid July 15th, 20th of July.

769
01:06:24,093 --> 01:06:24,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

770
01:06:24,533 --> 01:06:26,575
[SPEAKER_00]: So would it be a year back from that?

771
01:06:27,035 --> 01:06:45,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when are you thinking after submitting a nomination papers or you know, when the nomination papers, the debt from the day the nomination papers became available, maybe are certified or do when the papers are due, you must have had a year in the city.

772
01:06:45,327 --> 01:06:47,089
[SPEAKER_00]: And you must be a registered voter in the city.

773
01:06:47,869 --> 01:06:48,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

774
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:49,510
[SPEAKER_00]: Six or one half dozen.

775
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:50,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're gonna

776
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,303
[SPEAKER_03]: We just need to define it.

777
01:06:52,484 --> 01:06:52,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

778
01:06:52,904 --> 01:06:55,649
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have like 17 minutes left or something.

779
01:06:55,689 --> 01:06:57,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go on to 4-2.

780
01:06:58,914 --> 01:06:59,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

781
01:06:59,836 --> 01:07:01,298
[SPEAKER_03]: We're making a lot of progress tonight.

782
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:02,360
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of progress.

783
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,241
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great meeting.

784
01:07:06,995 --> 01:07:09,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Organization, chair, vice chair, and clerk.

785
01:07:09,537 --> 01:07:14,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, notice they call it clerk, but in Medford, it's customarily been called secretary.

786
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:21,724
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have specific duties for our secretary, which does differ among school committees across Massachusetts.

787
01:07:21,824 --> 01:07:23,445
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me give you a little.

788
01:07:25,585 --> 01:07:29,487
[SPEAKER_03]: So in number one, the mayor shall serve as the chair of the school committee.

789
01:07:29,647 --> 01:07:49,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Immediately prior to the first regular committee meeting, this is very standard language, or as soon as practical after school committee members elect have been qualified following each regular city election, the school committee members shall choose from amongst themselves a vice chair and secretary who will serve for one year.

790
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:59,987
[SPEAKER_03]: The position should rotate amongst members with no member serving more than one consecutive year in the role for which they have been selected for by their peers.

791
01:08:01,689 --> 01:08:05,854
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we've already kind of leaning towards that.

792
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:12,596
[SPEAKER_03]: The next paragraph said if the mayor is not automatically chair and then spells out.

793
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:21,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So the thing that I added, which is it was practiced for years and years and years that vice chair would rotate.

794
01:08:23,109 --> 01:08:24,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some people got kind of greedy.

795
01:08:25,451 --> 01:08:28,232
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with their friends, they kind of determined that they shouldn't rotate.

796
01:08:28,773 --> 01:08:38,619
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason I wanted and put it in the charter is is that school committee members, if you would, are there six voted equally.

797
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:44,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And the chair, I believe, strongly should rotate, as I do with the secretary.

798
01:08:44,443 --> 01:08:45,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the vice chair.

799
01:08:46,745 --> 01:08:48,927
[SPEAKER_03]: the vice chair, the vice chair and the secretary.

800
01:08:49,347 --> 01:08:52,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that those should rotate amongst the members.

801
01:08:54,571 --> 01:08:57,192
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so that's why I put it in.

802
01:08:57,993 --> 01:09:03,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a question, Paula, because you were the secretary for most of your career there.

803
01:09:05,058 --> 01:09:12,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an issue with, you know, you've mentioned the workload and paying the bills, and is it something that

804
01:09:12,883 --> 01:09:18,327
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel is something that people will want to rotate or they want to just get one person who does it well to continue.

805
01:09:19,222 --> 01:09:35,605
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think that, so over the years, so in the initial years, when I first was on the school committee, so after, let's say I'd been on the school committee for three or four years, people didn't, it used to involve hours and hours of time.

806
01:09:35,985 --> 01:09:37,566
[SPEAKER_03]: It would take a full school day.

807
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:41,787
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd go up in the morning and you'd spend there for hours and people didn't wanna do it.

808
01:09:42,347 --> 01:09:44,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's how I did it over and over.

809
01:09:44,667 --> 01:09:47,688
[SPEAKER_03]: In the last years, there's been much more,

810
01:09:50,389 --> 01:09:51,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Kathy Kretz did it one year.

811
01:09:52,392 --> 01:09:53,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Mia did it one year.

812
01:09:53,473 --> 01:09:54,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul Rousseau did it.

813
01:09:54,955 --> 01:09:56,557
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been more changeover.

814
01:09:57,458 --> 01:09:59,380
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a stipend attached to it.

815
01:09:59,521 --> 01:10:01,223
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not much.

816
01:10:01,243 --> 01:10:02,925
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a stipend for the vice chair.

817
01:10:03,585 --> 01:10:06,829
[SPEAKER_03]: The stipend for the secretary is more because it's acknowledged that it's more work.

818
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:19,692
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are school committees that don't have the secretary signing off the bills, but they form a subcommittee.

819
01:10:20,953 --> 01:10:25,614
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the bills are brought to the subcommittee for an approval of three members.

820
01:10:26,214 --> 01:10:33,555
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something we could recommend or talk to the school committee about.

821
01:10:33,895 --> 01:10:35,376
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not how we're set up now.

822
01:10:37,758 --> 01:10:39,639
[SPEAKER_03]: really their internal workings.

823
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:42,341
[SPEAKER_03]: How much we want to get into it, I don't know.

824
01:10:44,003 --> 01:10:49,647
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're talking about how it's set up now, I think that we should just say the school committee shall rotate.

825
01:10:49,987 --> 01:11:01,936
[SPEAKER_03]: So Paul could do it one year, and then Aaron's going to do it one year, and then Paul can do it again, and then Erica is going to do it.

826
01:11:01,976 --> 01:11:04,898
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't mean that Paul can never do it again.

827
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:07,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just he can't do it two consecutive years.

828
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:09,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine with it.

829
01:11:09,821 --> 01:11:12,602
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that written in their operational handbook that they have?

830
01:11:13,282 --> 01:11:13,962
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that.

831
01:11:14,062 --> 01:11:14,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's new.

832
01:11:15,303 --> 01:11:16,683
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be new, right?

833
01:11:17,363 --> 01:11:25,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So the school committee just in the charter, they did not define that in the we're going to get to four or five, which has it.

834
01:11:26,185 --> 01:11:28,046
[SPEAKER_03]: It talks about the role of the secretary.

835
01:11:28,186 --> 01:11:33,267
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not say the the position should rotate amongst members.

836
01:11:33,807 --> 01:11:33,967
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

837
01:11:34,915 --> 01:11:35,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I have added that.

838
01:11:35,856 --> 01:11:39,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Ron, you had asked me at one point, did I have anything I wanted to get in here?

839
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:45,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's one of those things that I think that it makes it more fair.

840
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:46,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it makes it more equitable.

841
01:11:47,385 --> 01:11:49,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it gives people different opportunities.

842
01:11:49,987 --> 01:11:51,928
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're the chairperson of this committee.

843
01:11:52,028 --> 01:11:53,189
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the best experience.

844
01:11:53,229 --> 01:11:54,390
[SPEAKER_00]: So I support what you're saying.

845
01:11:54,967 --> 01:12:00,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's move on definitely agree with the rotating to have a question.

846
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:07,692
[SPEAKER_01]: It says should rotate with no member serving more than 1 consecutive year in the role for which they've been selected.

847
01:12:07,832 --> 01:12:08,092
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

848
01:12:09,453 --> 01:12:11,414
[SPEAKER_01]: If I understand this correctly.

849
01:12:12,714 --> 01:12:15,835
[SPEAKER_01]: If I am the secretary.

850
01:12:15,855 --> 01:12:18,917
[SPEAKER_01]: This year from January 1st, 2024.

851
01:12:18,997 --> 01:12:19,037
[SPEAKER_01]: To.

852
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:29,000
[SPEAKER_01]: December 30th, 2024, I could do it again for calendar year 2025, correct?

853
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:29,280
[SPEAKER_01]: 2026, right?

854
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,722
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm doing it now in 2024.

855
01:12:31,762 --> 01:12:34,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, then you can do it again in 2026 and maybe your vice chair in between.

856
01:12:35,043 --> 01:12:35,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a term or a year?

857
01:12:35,864 --> 01:12:35,984
[SPEAKER_01]: A year.

858
01:12:50,528 --> 01:12:53,210
[SPEAKER_00]: So Paula, Eunice brings up a really good point.

859
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:59,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we be looking at fiscal year where you're processing bills in a given fiscal year against a fiscal budget?

860
01:12:59,795 --> 01:12:59,996
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

861
01:13:00,016 --> 01:13:01,797
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to a calendar year.

862
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:06,681
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be a calendar year because the school committee members take their seats in January.

863
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:07,641
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

864
01:13:07,782 --> 01:13:15,407
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't know if transferring, you're going to transfer halfway through your fiscal bookings.

865
01:13:15,467 --> 01:13:18,490
[SPEAKER_07]: You could lose your secretary because of an election that way, right?

866
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:21,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

867
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,542
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just asking.

868
01:13:22,622 --> 01:13:24,065
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an opinion.

869
01:13:24,927 --> 01:13:26,650
[SPEAKER_01]: So is the secretary now.

870
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:30,117
[SPEAKER_01]: And he will be the secretary for.

871
01:13:32,364 --> 01:13:37,426
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the rules that we're putting into place, he's the secretary through December 31st, 2024.

872
01:13:37,546 --> 01:13:43,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, January 1st, 2025. he's in the 2nd year of his term, but could he be the secretary for calendar year 2025?

873
01:13:43,189 --> 01:13:43,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.

874
01:13:53,137 --> 01:14:03,824
[SPEAKER_03]: He could, perhaps his peers would elect him to be vice chair, okay, and that's fine, okay, but he cannot serve in the same role consecutively for two years.

875
01:14:03,844 --> 01:14:05,986
[SPEAKER_00]: If we change, yeah, I think that that's.

876
01:14:06,106 --> 01:14:19,475
[SPEAKER_03]: And my feeling, by the way, is based on, I always thought it was wrong, even though I did it because nobody else would do it, it was absolutely wrong that I

877
01:14:21,275 --> 01:14:23,818
[SPEAKER_03]: was the secretary for multiple years running.

878
01:14:24,138 --> 01:14:29,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Because who was checking to make sure that I wasn't in cahoots, you know?

879
01:14:29,424 --> 01:14:29,964
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much power.

880
01:14:30,224 --> 01:14:34,669
[SPEAKER_05]: The truth always comes out, Paulette.

881
01:14:34,689 --> 01:14:38,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Too much power.

882
01:14:38,993 --> 01:14:40,675
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all the water went, right?

883
01:14:40,715 --> 01:14:42,197
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all the bottled water went.

884
01:14:43,742 --> 01:14:45,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it right there.

885
01:14:45,944 --> 01:14:46,724
[SPEAKER_04]: We have it.

886
01:14:46,844 --> 01:14:48,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is on record, right, Ron?

887
01:14:48,705 --> 01:14:50,346
[SPEAKER_04]: This is on record, right, Ron?

888
01:14:51,087 --> 01:14:52,248
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the record.

889
01:14:53,329 --> 01:14:54,589
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you do it.

890
01:14:54,629 --> 01:14:55,670
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

891
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:56,491
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great point.

892
01:14:56,671 --> 01:14:57,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

893
01:14:57,711 --> 01:15:00,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

894
01:15:01,354 --> 01:15:02,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, let's move on.

895
01:15:02,435 --> 01:15:03,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Powers and duties.

896
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:05,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all.

897
01:15:05,777 --> 01:15:07,618
[SPEAKER_01]: So can we just go back one second?

898
01:15:10,208 --> 01:15:17,110
[SPEAKER_01]: If Paul serves four more terms, could he be secretary again?

899
01:15:17,790 --> 01:15:18,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Every other year.

900
01:15:18,490 --> 01:15:19,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Every other year.

901
01:15:19,651 --> 01:15:20,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

902
01:15:20,111 --> 01:15:23,072
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't micromanage it so much, but you can put this in.

903
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:34,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, powers and duties with the collaboration of the superintendent of schools.

904
01:15:34,735 --> 01:15:38,458
[SPEAKER_03]: The chair shall prepare the agenda for committee school committee meetings.

905
01:15:38,958 --> 01:15:45,924
[SPEAKER_03]: The chair shall preside at all regular meetings of the school committee, regulate its proceedings and decide all questions of order.

906
01:15:46,664 --> 01:15:55,454
[SPEAKER_03]: The chair shall appoint all members of the school committee to the various subcommittees of the school committee after seeking their individual input regarding interest and availability.

907
01:15:55,694 --> 01:16:00,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And I should tell you that clause I added, that is generally how it happened.

908
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:04,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that there's a good reason for making sure it stays in.

909
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:11,949
[SPEAKER_03]: The chair will have the same powers to vote upon measures coming before the school committee as any other member of the school committee.

910
01:16:12,249 --> 01:16:19,834
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee chair shall perform such other duties consistent with the office as may be provided by charter, by ordinance, or by other vote of the school committee.

911
01:16:20,134 --> 01:16:21,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I put that in italics just to note.

912
01:16:21,715 --> 01:16:26,558
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked that language up directly from the other things in the call center.

913
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:36,826
[SPEAKER_03]: The vice chair shall provide, in the absence of the chair, secretary or clerk, the secretary has the responsibility to record the votes taken at regular school committee meetings.

914
01:16:37,006 --> 01:16:48,115
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, the secretary is responsible for overseeing and approving the bills of the school department, which is outlined more clearly in the next document, although it's probably- Just a quick question, Paulette.

915
01:16:48,155 --> 01:16:54,020
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you the sole, as the clerk slash secretary, the sole approver of these bills?

916
01:16:54,553 --> 01:16:59,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, but well, no, not, so the superintendent approves the bills.

917
01:16:59,975 --> 01:17:03,417
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got the finance office putting it together.

918
01:17:03,657 --> 01:17:05,878
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the superintendent signing off on it.

919
01:17:06,358 --> 01:17:09,460
[SPEAKER_00]: And the superintendent- Three approvals to get it done?

920
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:10,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

921
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it, okay.

922
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:14,302
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee member goes last.

923
01:17:16,162 --> 01:17:16,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

924
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.

925
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:21,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a dollar amount involved in approving bills, Paula?

926
01:17:23,554 --> 01:17:26,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Every bill, I approved bills for pizza.

927
01:17:27,099 --> 01:17:35,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I approved bills for, you know, huge, huge things for the tops of the schools, for air conditioning.

928
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:38,234
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so there's no over $25,000, you need an extra layer of approvals.

929
01:17:41,402 --> 01:17:51,627
[SPEAKER_03]: So the difference is that when I started out, you had to sign with your signature, the problem when you had a long name, every single bill.

930
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Now they come together in batches.

931
01:17:54,589 --> 01:17:55,969
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't take as long.

932
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:56,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

933
01:17:58,631 --> 01:18:02,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's since I left, they could even have updated it since then, I have to ask Paul, which I will do.

934
01:18:03,433 --> 01:18:03,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

935
01:18:04,854 --> 01:18:06,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Is all of that sort of fairly?

936
01:18:06,074 --> 01:18:09,396
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's all good.

937
01:18:10,308 --> 01:18:14,733
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on to school committee powers and duties.

938
01:18:16,214 --> 01:18:17,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to do a time check.

939
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:18,537
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at 825.

940
01:18:20,118 --> 01:18:20,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

941
01:18:20,939 --> 01:18:30,549
[SPEAKER_03]: When I read the Collins Center, what they did for the powers and duties in those different ones, it was clear to me that nobody really had been on the school committee.

942
01:18:31,913 --> 01:18:43,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Because frankly, they were, they were very brief, you know, and I thought that it was not very overarching.

943
01:18:43,496 --> 01:18:53,159
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a much clearer, this document was put together, and it was put together quite a long time ago, with the help of the MASC, but I mean years ago.

944
01:18:54,059 --> 01:18:57,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Lina DiGianto Masso and I first sat

945
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:03,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I had run on making sure that we had a policy handbook that could be posted.

946
01:19:04,647 --> 01:19:10,072
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the policy handbook began way back when Lena was still on the committee.

947
01:19:10,773 --> 01:19:13,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has since been updated.

948
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:18,060
[SPEAKER_03]: And MASC, our Massachusetts Association of School Committee members,

949
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,122
[SPEAKER_03]: came in, we went through policy after policy.

950
01:19:22,502 --> 01:19:23,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it was done again.

951
01:19:23,902 --> 01:19:30,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, you know, school committee powers and duties.

952
01:19:33,587 --> 01:19:35,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a good document.

953
01:19:35,207 --> 01:19:37,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's wording that might need to be changed.

954
01:19:37,909 --> 01:19:40,130
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a very clear document.

955
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:43,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Aubrey, could you scroll down a little bit?

956
01:19:47,133 --> 01:19:47,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it a little bit larger.

957
01:19:50,535 --> 01:19:58,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right now where it says a voting majority of the school committee shall exercise the following powers and perform the following duties.

958
01:19:59,223 --> 01:20:04,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And no individual member is empowered to act unless by vote of the school committee.

959
01:20:04,428 --> 01:20:12,776
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go down to the second one, elect a superintendent, assistant superintendent of schools, business manager, director of special education and nurses.

960
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the reasons why I'm saying that this page is so much more accurate than what the Collins Center is, is because there's this very funny thing.

961
01:20:24,143 --> 01:20:29,846
[SPEAKER_03]: It's spelled out very clearly in the law what the school committee, who they should elect.

962
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:34,868
[SPEAKER_03]: And nurses was in that category.

963
01:20:37,401 --> 01:20:38,903
[SPEAKER_03]: the Director of Special Education.

964
01:20:39,003 --> 01:20:39,664
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the ones.

965
01:20:39,764 --> 01:20:48,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I did not go back to verify that all of these are up to date since usually the MASC updates these periodically.

966
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:57,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to pointing that out.

967
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:04,821
[SPEAKER_03]: of saying, if you look back into that other Collins document, it does not spill out these other responsibilities.

968
01:21:05,921 --> 01:21:07,322
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could go down a little bit more.

969
01:21:08,682 --> 01:21:13,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you just clarify, when you say Collins document, do you mean the generic modern charter?

970
01:21:14,443 --> 01:21:17,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the one where it had three different communities represented.

971
01:21:18,023 --> 01:21:18,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

972
01:21:18,724 --> 01:21:22,364
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's technically not language from the Collins Center.

973
01:21:22,404 --> 01:21:24,364
[SPEAKER_07]: It's language from those charters.

974
01:21:25,105 --> 01:21:25,405
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

975
01:21:25,945 --> 01:21:27,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if someone put it together,

976
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:28,520
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

977
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:35,948
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, they gave us the generic frame and then I put in the language from each of the charters just so we can see it.

978
01:21:36,608 --> 01:21:37,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

979
01:21:37,709 --> 01:21:38,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought they did it.

980
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:40,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize you did all that work, Milda.

981
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:40,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.

982
01:21:41,753 --> 01:21:42,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

983
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:47,739
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, the so yeah, that that's the document.

984
01:21:48,059 --> 01:21:49,861
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go back to the second.

985
01:21:53,928 --> 01:22:00,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the secretary, let's see, it's one, two, three, four, five bullets, yep.

986
01:22:01,210 --> 01:22:06,391
[SPEAKER_03]: The secretary on the 15th and last business day of each month will approve and sign bills for payment.

987
01:22:06,991 --> 01:22:09,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Signed bills are sent to the city auditor for payment.

988
01:22:10,012 --> 01:22:16,973
[SPEAKER_03]: The scheduled bills as approved and signed by the secretary shall be presented to the school committee for approval of the next regular meeting of the committee.

989
01:22:17,373 --> 01:22:20,054
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee will receive regular financial reports.

990
01:22:20,114 --> 01:22:23,215
[SPEAKER_03]: So Ron, to answer your question better than I did.

991
01:22:24,376 --> 01:22:29,241
[SPEAKER_03]: After the secretary signs it, they are then presented at the school committee meeting.

992
01:22:31,242 --> 01:22:38,205
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point, any school committee member during that presentation gets to ask about such and such bill.

993
01:22:39,025 --> 01:22:45,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And then often the secretary will pipe up, I saw that one, that's what this is about.

994
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:49,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the superintendent will say, that has to do with, okay.

995
01:22:49,809 --> 01:22:59,712
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are more eyes afterwards, but they don't, the school committee as a whole doesn't receive, they don't see the actual invoices that the secretary does.

996
01:23:00,232 --> 01:23:03,474
[SPEAKER_00]: Paulette, who does the assignment to the budget line item?

997
01:23:03,575 --> 01:23:07,798
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the city finance people, or is it the secretaries involved in that?

998
01:23:07,818 --> 01:23:08,538
[SPEAKER_00]: The school finance.

999
01:23:08,558 --> 01:23:08,778
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?

1000
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:09,999
[SPEAKER_00]: The school finance.

1001
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:10,920
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, the school finance.

1002
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:11,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

1003
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:11,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1004
01:23:11,721 --> 01:23:15,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, this is on the 15th and last business day of each month.

1005
01:23:16,264 --> 01:23:19,487
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I think, mid-month and end of month.

1006
01:23:19,807 --> 01:23:23,830
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit more flexible than this actual wording suggests.

1007
01:23:25,031 --> 01:23:25,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1008
01:23:26,422 --> 01:23:27,803
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would probably go back.

1009
01:23:28,644 --> 01:23:30,025
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good document.

1010
01:23:30,045 --> 01:23:31,226
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one question about it.

1011
01:23:31,706 --> 01:23:32,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

1012
01:23:34,328 --> 01:23:37,890
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recall reading anything about the annual review of the superintendent.

1013
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:39,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that a major task of the school committee?

1014
01:23:41,193 --> 01:23:41,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1015
01:23:41,933 --> 01:23:42,494
[SPEAKER_03]: It certainly is.

1016
01:23:42,774 --> 01:23:44,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it in this here?

1017
01:23:44,535 --> 01:23:47,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a whole other page dealing with it.

1018
01:23:47,837 --> 01:23:48,198
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1019
01:23:48,218 --> 01:23:49,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all.

1020
01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:51,700
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to be covered later, that's fine.

1021
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:52,581
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't see it.

1022
01:23:53,411 --> 01:23:56,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the question is, how much do we put in?

1023
01:23:56,674 --> 01:24:01,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you know that there's a very, very detailed policy handbook, okay?

1024
01:24:01,557 --> 01:24:02,858
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just one page.

1025
01:24:03,399 --> 01:24:06,961
[SPEAKER_03]: There are hundreds of pages of policy.

1026
01:24:08,483 --> 01:24:09,664
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do we put in?

1027
01:24:09,684 --> 01:24:11,145
[SPEAKER_03]: This one made sense to me.

1028
01:24:11,165 --> 01:24:20,432
[SPEAKER_03]: When you say you elect the superintendent, we certainly could put in another bullet point, which says that responsible for the review of the superintendent.

1029
01:24:21,781 --> 01:24:26,725
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought, you know, I know that there's Massachusetts laws that back up all the stuff that's not listed.

1030
01:24:27,085 --> 01:24:38,552
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, only because it's our charter, I just think it should be in writing that I think one of the main tasks that the school committee has is that annual review.

1031
01:24:39,093 --> 01:24:42,375
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have an annual review of themselves.

1032
01:24:43,836 --> 01:24:45,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much as important as the superintendent.

1033
01:24:46,378 --> 01:24:46,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well.

1034
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:53,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, by and large, with a few doctors on this.

1035
01:24:53,832 --> 01:24:54,972
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.

1036
01:24:55,652 --> 01:24:56,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I do too.

1037
01:24:57,193 --> 01:24:58,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it should.

1038
01:24:59,074 --> 01:25:00,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it can't hurt to include the whole thing.

1039
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:12,085
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's I mean, going from a 2 and a half page charter that didn't even mention the school committee to having as much spelled out as we possibly can.

1040
01:25:13,846 --> 01:25:14,846
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that's.

1041
01:25:15,647 --> 01:25:19,749
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be leaving very little chance or interpretation.

1042
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:24,471
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm in the different.

1043
01:25:25,227 --> 01:25:28,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first point on this, it says legislation on policymaking.

1044
01:25:29,068 --> 01:25:39,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that would probably be assumed that when it says the committee is responsible for the development of policy as guides for administrative action and for employing a superintendent who will implement its policy.

1045
01:25:39,149 --> 01:25:41,250
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably somewhere embedded in that.

1046
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, at that area.

1047
01:25:42,830 --> 01:25:45,951
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I would put just a need annually.

1048
01:25:46,231 --> 01:25:48,091
[SPEAKER_00]: It's annually a formal report.

1049
01:25:48,331 --> 01:25:48,751
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.

1050
01:25:50,271 --> 01:25:51,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a couple of questions.

1051
01:25:51,952 --> 01:25:53,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Phyllis, where did you put that?

1052
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:59,941
[SPEAKER_05]: That was on number one under school committee powers and duties legislative or policymaking.

1053
01:26:00,201 --> 01:26:00,361
OK.

1054
01:26:01,121 --> 01:26:02,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, somewhere it says implementation.

1055
01:26:02,922 --> 01:26:03,602
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one.

1056
01:26:04,383 --> 01:26:12,786
[SPEAKER_05]: It says the committee is responsible for the development of policy as guides for administrative action or for employing a superintendent who will implement its policies.

1057
01:26:13,487 --> 01:26:21,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there would be the review and guidelines for professional development or whatever.

1058
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:25,313
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be under the appraisals instead of saying appraisals, just review.

1059
01:26:25,933 --> 01:26:26,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, review.

1060
01:26:28,976 --> 01:26:30,397
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just words, but.

1061
01:26:31,158 --> 01:26:31,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1062
01:26:31,739 --> 01:26:43,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the only thing is as we change it, this, I do kind of need to check with the MACC and putting it together just to make sure that's all, you know, whatever.

1063
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:46,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Aubrey has some questions.

1064
01:26:47,415 --> 01:26:48,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just have a couple of questions.

1065
01:26:48,556 --> 01:26:50,597
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that first line with all the bold.

1066
01:26:50,637 --> 01:27:00,402
[SPEAKER_06]: My question is if we start listing powers and duties and don't list things, does that limit or set a precedent for things that gets us into trouble later?

1067
01:27:00,422 --> 01:27:03,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And my understanding is that the charter is hard to amend.

1068
01:27:04,244 --> 01:27:14,170
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when we are coming up with language for this, I'd prefer vague and reference to something like a policy handbook that can be updated later.

1069
01:27:15,388 --> 01:27:18,510
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a disclaimer that falls into the Mass General Laws.

1070
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:23,472
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always that disclaimer that anything we decide would be washed up against that.

1071
01:27:23,692 --> 01:27:26,314
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hear what you're saying.

1072
01:27:26,334 --> 01:27:36,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if Bill stopped being the 15th and started being the 18th, it's not like... Yeah, I don't know why that's there, but obviously there must be some process that says that.

1073
01:27:36,739 --> 01:27:38,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Aubrey makes a good point.

1074
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:40,481
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess I would just wonder whether...

1075
01:27:42,012 --> 01:27:46,556
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, have we seen other charters that have this level of detail?

1076
01:27:49,859 --> 01:27:50,620
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be my question.

1077
01:27:51,261 --> 01:27:52,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how can we answer that?

1078
01:27:52,402 --> 01:27:56,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, I mean, we've only, you know, no, we haven't seen other charters.

1079
01:27:58,787 --> 01:27:59,048
[SPEAKER_03]: You know,

1080
01:27:59,833 --> 01:28:05,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have that many variables document that lists 40 or 50 different charters.

1081
01:28:06,118 --> 01:28:06,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean.

1082
01:28:06,438 --> 01:28:07,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you can look at them.

1083
01:28:07,919 --> 01:28:11,722
[SPEAKER_07]: And did you say that it was on the MASC website?

1084
01:28:12,062 --> 01:28:13,303
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a section with charters?

1085
01:28:14,424 --> 01:28:16,325
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know about that.

1086
01:28:16,585 --> 01:28:23,010
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, this is in accordance with the general laws.

1087
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:29,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Are these specific to school committees, Paula?

1088
01:28:30,932 --> 01:28:33,134
[SPEAKER_05]: These are specific to school committees, correct?

1089
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:34,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this is a school committee.

1090
01:28:34,395 --> 01:28:37,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is taken right from the school committee policy handbook.

1091
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:39,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1092
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,702
[SPEAKER_06]: That is totally fine for me.

1093
01:28:41,742 --> 01:28:50,070
[SPEAKER_06]: My only concern is that policy handbooks are much easier to edit than charters, if something should be left in two to ten years.

1094
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:52,072
[SPEAKER_05]: You are absolutely correct.

1095
01:28:52,932 --> 01:28:54,314
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the handbook is...

1096
01:28:59,186 --> 01:29:00,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's a good point.

1097
01:29:00,747 --> 01:29:18,522
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if the handbook gets, unless there's a provision in the charter that, you know, for lack of a better way is that, you know, the handbook supersedes, you know, or whatever's in the handbook is, you know, what we abide by.

1098
01:29:19,143 --> 01:29:20,724
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't, I don't think you can do that.

1099
01:29:20,744 --> 01:29:21,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you can.

1100
01:29:21,645 --> 01:29:23,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the charter has to be like the,

1101
01:29:24,698 --> 01:29:25,138
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bible.

1102
01:29:25,598 --> 01:29:30,840
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bible, because it has to be washed against the Massachusetts general laws.

1103
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:34,081
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just change the handbook.

1104
01:29:36,261 --> 01:29:36,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Ron.

1105
01:29:36,882 --> 01:29:37,362
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Ron.

1106
01:29:37,382 --> 01:29:37,722
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

1107
01:29:37,842 --> 01:29:38,282
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm done.

1108
01:29:38,302 --> 01:29:38,762
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done.

1109
01:29:39,402 --> 01:29:51,626
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, could we not include a statement that says the policies and procedure as stipulated in the school committee policy handbook?

1110
01:29:52,281 --> 01:29:52,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1111
01:29:52,621 --> 01:30:00,090
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing with doing that is that then you're sending someone else rather than being clear.

1112
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:02,233
[SPEAKER_03]: What does a school committee, what are they responsible for?

1113
01:30:03,902 --> 01:30:19,427
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, if the policy, if the school committee policy handbook is going to change off and on, I mean, I think there can be some language found to how that could, you know, how in the charter it says, you know, this is what we'll be following, you know.

1114
01:30:19,467 --> 01:30:27,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I looked at the powers and duties that were listed in the other communities, I found them to be inadequate.

1115
01:30:28,839 --> 01:30:43,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question is, if you want to go back and look at those documents, okay, and say, okay, let's take a look at this document and we'll take a look at those and we want to figure out which, that's fine.

1116
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:47,286
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no issue with what is listed here, Paula.

1117
01:30:47,426 --> 01:30:49,507
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not what I'm saying.

1118
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:52,748
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no issue with what is listed here.

1119
01:30:53,509 --> 01:30:56,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Aubrey's point brings a question to my mind.

1120
01:30:57,957 --> 01:31:03,581
[SPEAKER_05]: What she's saying is, it's easier to update a handbook than it is a charter.

1121
01:31:04,302 --> 01:31:17,132
[SPEAKER_05]: And while we may want this to be something that we are aware of, we may have to say, we followed the policies and procedures as per the school committee's handbook.

1122
01:31:18,687 --> 01:31:19,568
[SPEAKER_05]: with these things.

1123
01:31:19,668 --> 01:31:29,816
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're already in there, why can't we make the statement that these are the guidelines that will be followed when it comes to the powers and duties of the school committee?

1124
01:31:30,297 --> 01:31:37,543
[SPEAKER_05]: That way, people would always have to refer to this doc, the school committee's policy and procedure handbook.

1125
01:31:38,256 --> 01:31:46,642
[SPEAKER_05]: So updates, and there are changes, then we always have to refer to the school committee's policy handbook.

1126
01:31:47,122 --> 01:31:51,145
[SPEAKER_03]: So right at the top, I put the link to the committee policy.

1127
01:31:51,466 --> 01:31:54,528
[SPEAKER_03]: And I put this is from the Medford school committee policy handbook.

1128
01:31:55,108 --> 01:31:55,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1129
01:31:55,849 --> 01:31:59,151
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can add wording to that to make it even more clear.

1130
01:31:59,171 --> 01:32:06,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think any of us are disagreeing with you about what's laid out here on this paper.

1131
01:32:07,077 --> 01:32:07,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1132
01:32:07,905 --> 01:32:10,310
[SPEAKER_05]: But changes, I think Aubrey is what you're saying.

1133
01:32:10,370 --> 01:32:12,033
[SPEAKER_05]: If there are any updates in that, right?

1134
01:32:14,378 --> 01:32:17,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what I am saying that that it might be more difficult.

1135
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:17,825
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be better.

1136
01:32:17,985 --> 01:32:18,226
[SPEAKER_06]: It might.

1137
01:32:18,991 --> 01:32:28,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it possible to change this language to zoom out one level and just say you're responsible for this broad thing and then define it somewhere else that can be more easily thanked?

1138
01:32:28,699 --> 01:32:39,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And specifically also this, if I'm a specific bullet, exercise all other powers and perform all duties set forth in the Sydney Charter, we don't want that one because this is the Charter.

1139
01:32:39,908 --> 01:32:40,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1140
01:32:40,909 --> 01:32:41,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1141
01:32:42,250 --> 01:32:42,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1142
01:32:43,272 --> 01:32:43,693
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1143
01:32:44,797 --> 01:32:50,835
[SPEAKER_00]: Aubrey, specifically, what is the what's the just so I know which dot are we talking about?

1144
01:32:55,352 --> 01:33:04,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you saying like the 15th in the last business day of the month may change to the... Because I don't... It doesn't matter.

1145
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:07,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to identify the... I'm trying to... I understand what you're saying.

1146
01:33:07,141 --> 01:33:09,562
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the word textbook might be replaced with something else.

1147
01:33:09,622 --> 01:33:13,405
[SPEAKER_06]: They might be virtual books or who knows what that becomes later.

1148
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:13,725
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1149
01:33:13,805 --> 01:33:16,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Because ours says that we're stuck.

1150
01:33:16,607 --> 01:33:16,788
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1151
01:33:17,908 --> 01:33:18,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1152
01:33:18,989 --> 01:33:21,171
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.

1153
01:33:22,715 --> 01:33:30,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So guys, I will tell you that I clearly had spent a long time on all of these documents.

1154
01:33:32,180 --> 01:33:36,121
[SPEAKER_03]: When I got to this one, I started by doing the same process that I did with the others.

1155
01:33:36,522 --> 01:33:40,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at what we had and I kept on playing with it.

1156
01:33:40,063 --> 01:33:42,184
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just kept on saying, I don't like this wording.

1157
01:33:42,204 --> 01:33:43,045
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like this wording.

1158
01:33:43,425 --> 01:33:49,168
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went to this document and I said, I'm going to bring it to the committee because this is the most comprehensive.

1159
01:33:50,088 --> 01:33:52,489
[SPEAKER_03]: solid piece of definition.

1160
01:33:53,109 --> 01:33:59,872
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy if we want to edit it in whatever way and make it our own.

1161
01:34:00,272 --> 01:34:10,337
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you that I need help doing that because I don't have hours and hours this week before our next meeting.

1162
01:34:10,377 --> 01:34:11,957
[SPEAKER_05]: You did a lot of work, Paula.

1163
01:34:12,418 --> 01:34:12,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1164
01:34:12,718 --> 01:34:14,419
[SPEAKER_03]: There are still other areas

1165
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:22,343
[SPEAKER_03]: which I need to do, and I'd rather spend time on that then.

1166
01:34:22,363 --> 01:34:29,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Aubrey, if you think of any, first of all, I need somebody who's going to do the minutes, so I don't have to do the minutes this time.

1167
01:34:30,787 --> 01:34:35,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do the minutes this time, and I can have two proposals for this document to make it easier.

1168
01:34:35,610 --> 01:34:36,971
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine with most of the language.

1169
01:34:37,311 --> 01:34:47,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to take out the bullet that says charter because it's circular in the charter, and then add some kind of language that says- What if we change textbooks to curriculums?

1170
01:34:48,195 --> 01:34:48,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.

1171
01:34:48,896 --> 01:34:49,816
[SPEAKER_03]: Curriculum.

1172
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:53,379
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could do learning materials, but.

1173
01:34:53,519 --> 01:34:54,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Learning materials would be great.

1174
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:55,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Learning materials.

1175
01:34:55,621 --> 01:34:59,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's something that says, including but not limited to the following.

1176
01:35:00,184 --> 01:35:03,166
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so we need to be very careful on this one.

1177
01:35:03,206 --> 01:35:05,989
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to talk to the superintendent on how to word it.

1178
01:35:06,049 --> 01:35:11,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you see, when it was textbooks, they actually brought the textbooks into our meeting.

1179
01:35:11,753 --> 01:35:14,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And we sat and physically look at them.

1180
01:35:15,236 --> 01:35:16,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Learning materials, that could be a website.

1181
01:35:17,577 --> 01:35:20,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we could go down many more pitfalls with this.

1182
01:35:22,138 --> 01:35:28,879
[SPEAKER_03]: And because we certainly don't want to put the school committee approving every book that comes into the library.

1183
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:35,601
[SPEAKER_03]: So this one is an interesting one to try and whatever.

1184
01:35:35,721 --> 01:35:40,902
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, Aubrey, if you can just just highlight it or do something so that we can go back.

1185
01:35:41,062 --> 01:35:43,323
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1186
01:35:43,443 --> 01:35:44,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, I know we're past time.

1187
01:35:44,663 --> 01:35:45,323
[SPEAKER_06]: So just one more.

1188
01:35:46,136 --> 01:35:50,078
[SPEAKER_06]: question is that this you said was the first page of a multi-page document.

1189
01:35:50,098 --> 01:35:53,140
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is an example of the duties.

1190
01:35:53,881 --> 01:35:58,543
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a subsection of a much longer document.

1191
01:35:59,044 --> 01:36:00,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So this does not include everything.

1192
01:36:00,925 --> 01:36:11,231
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could remove that bullet that has textbooks and not address it in here and say and other duties because those are going to be included anyway, right?

1193
01:36:11,691 --> 01:36:12,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1194
01:36:13,302 --> 01:36:16,644
[SPEAKER_06]: So something like that can just, we can just remove anything that could be.

1195
01:36:16,664 --> 01:36:17,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Or global.

1196
01:36:17,425 --> 01:36:17,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1197
01:36:18,045 --> 01:36:19,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely.

1198
01:36:19,426 --> 01:36:21,688
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can feel free to go through.

1199
01:36:22,408 --> 01:36:34,497
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, if anybody would like to look at the policies, if you go to the school committee section of our website, and at some point or another, it pops up school committee policy handbook.

1200
01:36:35,497 --> 01:36:40,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see all of it.

1201
01:36:40,801 --> 01:36:41,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1202
01:36:41,581 --> 01:36:41,682
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1203
01:36:43,399 --> 01:36:49,683
[SPEAKER_03]: This one, the subheading on what I was looking at was school committee powers and duties.

1204
01:36:51,204 --> 01:36:52,325
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what we did.

1205
01:36:54,146 --> 01:37:07,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so Aubrey, if you make those changes, my homework is to now go back to the other sections, which I didn't do, and see if I can get those lined up with everything we've talked about now, okay?

1206
01:37:08,494 --> 01:37:09,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, we're gonna lay on,

1207
01:37:10,035 --> 01:37:18,865
[SPEAKER_03]: the table, but I think it's okay because I think we're going to take it up in someplace else, is the concern about the public participation.

1208
01:37:20,447 --> 01:37:23,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have any members of the public on here tonight right now?

1209
01:37:24,392 --> 01:37:26,394
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

1210
01:37:26,514 --> 01:37:26,714
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1211
01:37:26,834 --> 01:37:29,257
[SPEAKER_03]: No, so we don't need to ask for any more.

1212
01:37:29,618 --> 01:37:30,539
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not there.

1213
01:37:31,186 --> 01:37:32,807
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I'm running out of steam now.

1214
01:37:33,968 --> 01:37:34,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to go to bed.

1215
01:37:34,809 --> 01:37:36,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Motion to adjourn.

1216
01:37:36,371 --> 01:37:37,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.

1217
01:37:37,251 --> 01:37:38,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say something, Ron, first.

1218
01:37:38,933 --> 01:37:41,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank Paulette.

1219
01:37:42,055 --> 01:37:44,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Even reading the materials, I understood how much work you did.

1220
01:37:44,898 --> 01:37:46,479
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can't even imagine the work.

1221
01:37:46,539 --> 01:37:50,583
[SPEAKER_05]: So my sincere thank you to you for doing this.

1222
01:37:50,723 --> 01:37:51,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, major kudos.

1223
01:37:52,124 --> 01:37:53,545
[SPEAKER_05]: It made this conversation easy.

1224
01:37:54,266 --> 01:37:55,207
[SPEAKER_05]: It made the meeting.

1225
01:37:55,963 --> 01:37:56,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Good meeting.

1226
01:37:56,463 --> 01:37:57,764
[SPEAKER_05]: Efficient and effective.

1227
01:37:57,784 --> 01:38:01,066
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of the best meetings we have had in my estimation.

1228
01:38:01,586 --> 01:38:02,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I really mean that.

1229
01:38:02,327 --> 01:38:04,968
[SPEAKER_05]: And I felt a lot of clarification tonight.

1230
01:38:05,388 --> 01:38:08,971
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that having these and having them prepared, so I know.

1231
01:38:09,811 --> 01:38:10,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1232
01:38:10,792 --> 01:38:11,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'll be quiet.

1233
01:38:12,112 --> 01:38:12,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1234
01:38:12,473 --> 01:38:17,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we adjourn, Ron, can you say one more time the date of the next meeting?

1235
01:38:19,176 --> 01:38:20,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Thursday, April 11th.

1236
01:38:20,777 --> 01:38:20,997
[SPEAKER_03]: At 7th.

1237
01:38:25,460 --> 01:38:31,502
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I probably, on that particular day, I don't have my grandson, so I could move it to 630 if that was preferable.

1238
01:38:32,842 --> 01:38:33,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I could go to bed earlier.

1239
01:38:34,482 --> 01:38:35,583
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that preferable?

1240
01:38:36,203 --> 01:38:38,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but maybe I'll make it a two-hour meeting.

1241
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:41,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe we have full committee meetings on the 4th and the 18th, so.

1242
01:38:42,124 --> 01:38:44,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Aubrey, does that work for you to have a 630?

1243
01:38:44,625 --> 01:38:48,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that work for you?

1244
01:38:48,446 --> 01:38:49,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right.

1245
01:38:50,086 --> 01:38:50,246
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1246
01:38:50,707 --> 01:38:52,227
[SPEAKER_06]: We trained bedtime, so that'll be fine.

1247
01:38:54,775 --> 01:38:55,916
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so April.

1248
01:38:56,676 --> 01:38:57,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have any homework?

1249
01:38:58,257 --> 01:39:00,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Any action for each of us?

1250
01:39:00,478 --> 01:39:01,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's going to do the minutes, guys?

1251
01:39:02,539 --> 01:39:02,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Aubrey.

1252
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Aubrey, you're going to do that?

1253
01:39:05,181 --> 01:39:05,721
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, great.

1254
01:39:05,801 --> 01:39:06,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Aubrey.

1255
01:39:08,082 --> 01:39:13,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I have anything else specific except reviewing whatever I send out.

1256
01:39:13,625 --> 01:39:13,706
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

1257
01:39:13,786 --> 01:39:14,986
[SPEAKER_03]: All right?

1258
01:39:15,667 --> 01:39:16,207
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.

1259
01:39:16,767 --> 01:39:17,368
[SPEAKER_03]: I get in trouble.

1260
01:39:17,388 --> 01:39:17,668
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1261
01:39:18,458 --> 01:39:20,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all.

1262
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:23,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I heard a motion for adjournment.

1263
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:24,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody in favor?

1264
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:25,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Second by Phyllis.
