1
00:00:00,626 --> 00:00:00,806
Nope.

2
00:00:03,488 --> 00:00:05,869
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:06,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

4
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:08,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for joining us today.

5
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:12,012
[SPEAKER_07]: We are here at Medford Central Office.

6
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:14,053
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Peter Cushing.

7
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:17,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the assistant superintendent of schools here with.

8
00:00:18,616 --> 00:00:21,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Suzanne Galussi, also the assistant superintendent of elementary education.

9
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:22,878
[SPEAKER_03]: And.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Maurice Edvard-Vincent, superintendent of schools.

11
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:35,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this platform, I noticed somebody posted in the chat, is this like Zoom?

12
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:37,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is not like Zoom.

13
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:46,008
[SPEAKER_07]: This is kind of a television broadcast studio presentation that allows us to bring in numerous people.

14
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:48,790
[SPEAKER_07]: We anticipated a very high volume.

15
00:00:50,111 --> 00:01:13,662
[SPEAKER_07]: of participants, and so the Zoom functionality has a limit to it, and we wanted to make sure that we could have as many people as possible in, and the way you will communicate with us is you will submit a comment to the chat function or the comment box on the

16
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:17,331
[SPEAKER_07]: YouTube channel or our Facebook page.

17
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:32,020
[SPEAKER_07]: This presentation will be recorded and it will be available for people to watch, hear the answers, we'll be responding to your questions, and if we don't have answers, we're going to have to get back to you.

18
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:33,882
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an ever-changing situation.

19
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:41,104
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Edward Vincent to give a little bit more information about that.

20
00:01:41,204 --> 00:01:48,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll welcome some of our panelists into the studio who have really helped with our development of this plan thus far.

21
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:57,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to say hello and thank you everyone for joining us today to share your ideas, your thoughts, your perspectives, your concerns.

22
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:04,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I want to name specifically how challenging this current situation is for everyone.

23
00:02:05,343 --> 00:02:13,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And given the challenging and complicated circumstances, there would be honestly, there's no ideal plan.

24
00:02:15,856 --> 00:02:24,121
[SPEAKER_03]: But working together, the way we've come together for Medford, this is the best plan that we were able to come up with thus far.

25
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:37,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an opportunity, again, for you to be able to share your ideas, your thoughts, feedback with us so that we can continue to further enhance and improve what it is that we're trying to do for all of Medford.

26
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:42,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give you just a brief overview of the process that we've taken.

27
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:48,038
[SPEAKER_03]: This was truly a collaborative process that involved many, many different stakeholders.

28
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,420
[SPEAKER_03]: We utilized three core values.

29
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Our three guiding pillars were equity, consistency, and safety.

30
00:02:56,825 --> 00:03:04,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And those three guiding pillars that were used, they helped us to guide our planning of the workgroups,

31
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:11,490
[SPEAKER_03]: and how we operated to get to the final end product that you received over the weekend on Friday.

32
00:03:12,271 --> 00:03:16,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had work groups and those work groups focused on three areas.

33
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:21,118
[SPEAKER_03]: It was operations, it was instruction, and it was also communications.

34
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:32,880
[SPEAKER_03]: We held some listening sessions last week and got additional thoughts and perspectives of others who weren't able to join the subgroups, the working groups.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,043
[SPEAKER_03]: But because they had volunteered and they were willing to be part of the team, we were so appreciative of that contribution from them.

36
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:50,565
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did hold some listening sessions last week and we're holding one this evening and again tomorrow as well.

37
00:03:51,306 --> 00:03:58,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, gathering all of that feedback from what we had last week, we released the plan on Friday evening.

38
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:02,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is our timeline moving forward?

39
00:04:02,056 --> 00:04:11,464
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to continue to hear community feedback and we're going to integrate that feedback into our final plan.

40
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:34,122
[SPEAKER_03]: which we'll be presenting to school committee on Thursday evening, this Thursday, August 6th at 6 p.m., we have a school committee meeting and it'll be formally posted tomorrow, but that'll be an opportunity for us to talk again and discuss and for the school committee to weigh in and provide their guidance.

41
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:40,693
[SPEAKER_03]: The official plan will be submitted to DESI on Monday, August 10th.

42
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:50,463
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're on a very, very tight timeline, but we're going to do everything that we can to make that tight timeline and be in compliance with DESI.

43
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:54,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to give you the goals for tonight's session.

44
00:04:55,026 --> 00:05:00,649
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be able to hear your thoughts, your ideas, your concerns as we finalize the plan.

45
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:08,814
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to do our best to address those thoughts, your concerns, your ideas, questions that we can answer.

46
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:11,455
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a panel of us.

47
00:05:11,635 --> 00:05:14,257
[SPEAKER_03]: We will jump in and we will answer those questions.

48
00:05:14,937 --> 00:05:19,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, as Dr. Cushing said earlier, if we cannot answer the questions,

49
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,841
[SPEAKER_03]: then we will get it added to our FAQ.

50
00:05:23,621 --> 00:05:42,846
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, and again, due to the time constraints, we're not going to be able to probably answer every single question, because I can see the questions are coming in, you know, at a very good clip right now, which is wonderful, because all of your questions are going to be saved, and we will be able to address those questions in our FAQ.

51
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:59,800
[SPEAKER_03]: So, again, tonight, for your participation, please add your questions in the chat functions, either on Facebook or YouTube, and myself or any of the other panelists, we are going to try to start answering as many questions as possible.

52
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Cushing will be moderating today's session.

53
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:06,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, and I look forward to this conversation.

54
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:08,132
[SPEAKER_07]: My apologies.

55
00:06:08,512 --> 00:06:11,913
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, some of you have mentioned about masks and close quarters.

56
00:06:12,533 --> 00:06:26,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, we were only taking our masks off for very brief, um, moments of time to speak as you can, um, obviously see, I'm going to bring some people into the studio, um, so they can introduce themselves and just to give a little quick background.

57
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:28,116
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're going to start with some questions.

58
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:35,678
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to bring in, uh, Stacy Shulman, uh, John McLaughlin, Joan Bowen,

[SPEAKER_07]: and Paul Texera, just to start.

60
00:06:41,642 --> 00:06:46,704
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, so if you guys can introduce yourselves and just speak to a little bit of the process thus far.

61
00:06:55,742 --> 00:06:56,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, good evening.

00:06:56,422 --> 00:06:57,303

65
00:07:09,307 --> 00:07:09,867

00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:35,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening, I'm John McLaughlin.

73
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:41,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm director of buildings for the city for 30 years.

74
00:07:41,676 --> 00:07:49,918
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so I'm going to start going through questions and putting them up on the screen.

75
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:50,759
[SPEAKER_07]: You can

76
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,874
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, let me just bring in two more people actually real quick.

77
00:07:57,414 --> 00:08:01,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom, I'm going to go with you first and then Mr. Johnson.

78
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:03,618

80
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:12,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I worked on the communication and stakeholder engagement workgroup and also worked on the steering committee.

81
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:14,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking forward to diving into this all with you tonight.

82
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:18,765
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. Johnson.

83
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:20,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

84
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:21,800
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Kirk Johnson.

85
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I was the principal.

86
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:30,046
[SPEAKER_05]: I worked on the operations subcommittee with Dr. Cushing, and also I was on the steering committee with Dr. Robinson and her team.

87
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

88
00:08:32,188 --> 00:08:32,448
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

89
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:38,633
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to start with a question from Debbie, and you'll be able to see it come up on the screen.

90
00:08:38,873 --> 00:08:46,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Once we make our selection for our kids, is the decision final, or can we change our minds as things develop through late August and September?

91
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:48,440
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to turn that over to Ms.

92
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:48,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Galussi.

93
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:50,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

94
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

95
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:57,334
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one of the things that we are working to finalize right now.

96
00:08:58,194 --> 00:09:04,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of the discussion would be that we are thinking of breaking up the decision into semesters.

97
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:11,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Similarly, not maybe exactly like the grading goes, but maybe just one or two semesters.

98
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:12,784
[SPEAKER_10]: We understand that

99
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:19,472
[SPEAKER_10]: things, this whole, as Dr. Cushing mentioned, this whole situation is fluid.

100
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:27,034
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we know that family decisions are also going to be fluid and that some plans may not work for all students.

101
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:32,976
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to be collecting data every four to six weeks for various things.

102
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:39,017
[SPEAKER_10]: But one of the points that we're going to target is how the plans are working for students and for families.

103
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:44,499
[SPEAKER_10]: So a final decision and more information for that will be made available soon.

104
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:47,787
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, thank you very much.

105
00:09:48,227 --> 00:09:51,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And let me get some more of the questions here.

106
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:52,748
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for sending them in.

107
00:09:54,749 --> 00:09:58,570
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're going to go with this one here right now.

108
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:07,152
[SPEAKER_07]: Will electronic devices be given to each student regardless of education options, seeing as even the in-school option has built-in remote learning day?

109
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:11,413
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now we are planning to go one-to-one as a district.

110
00:10:12,493 --> 00:10:15,454
[SPEAKER_07]: We are facing some supply chain challenges

111
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:23,697
[SPEAKER_07]: We ordered them in June prior to the July 1 fiscal year, but we were able to get the order in ahead of time.

112
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:40,803
[SPEAKER_07]: However, the supply chain comes through China, the epicenter of where this all started, and we have had some challenges, and there are also some customs issues with the commerce department.

113
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:51,428
[SPEAKER_07]: So just want to make sure that we are going to be working on that and that we do intend to get that to all of our students.

114
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:58,112
[SPEAKER_07]: We will prioritize student need as devices come in.

115
00:10:58,332 --> 00:11:02,014
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we are not having devices, we will prioritize student need.

116
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:06,396
[SPEAKER_07]: I also want to invite a new person just to introduce themselves, Tony Ray.

117
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:11,229
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Tony Ray, you're now on the stream.

118
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,118
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, good evening.

119
00:11:17,138 --> 00:11:18,660
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see everybody here tonight.

120
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us.

121
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:32,107
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the feedback on info at, we've gotten a lot of feedback about outdoor classrooms.

122
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:37,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, outdoor classrooms are and outdoor learning spaces are being seriously considered.

123
00:11:37,493 --> 00:11:41,377
[SPEAKER_07]: We're currently looking into tents for some of our schools.

124
00:11:41,858 --> 00:11:44,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of our schools have a challenge of a small footprint.

125
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:50,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so there's a serious limitation as to how many tents we can fit on a site.

126
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:56,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, certain classes, band music and others are being recommended to be held outdoors.

127
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:03,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so we are currently exploring that there is a cost, um, for the tents.

128
00:12:03,268 --> 00:12:04,249
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not cheap.

129
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but we are currently finalizing how many we would like to have.

130
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:13,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and we are definitely trying to do that.

131
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:16,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I'm just gonna take a second here to scroll through the comments.

132
00:12:18,062 --> 00:12:20,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, real quick here.

133
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:20,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

134
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:29,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.

135
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:35,259
[SPEAKER_07]: If we have two kids in different schools, will it be coordinated that they both go on the same model?

136
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:35,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

137
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Galussi?

138
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:39,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

139
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:47,114
[SPEAKER_10]: That is something that we are also in the process of coordinating between all the schools and our data management

140
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:55,365
[SPEAKER_10]: person, Kim Miles, so we are going to ensure that families, we're giving families choice.

141
00:12:56,706 --> 00:13:07,914
[SPEAKER_10]: That is going to be part of the survey we send out, and if you would like your children to be part of the same cohort, or if you actually would like your children to be part of different cohorts, that may be more manageable for you in your home.

142
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:17,622
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to handle it through the survey, and that will be one of the questions that you can give us the feedback for, and then we'll have more information in creating the cohorts for you.

143
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:19,721
[SPEAKER_10]: hope that answered your question.

144
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:22,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

145
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:26,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me scroll through some of the questions here.

146
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:48,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony Ray, do you want to speak for a moment on PPE and nursing and all that good stuff that I'm sure everybody is questioning right now as well?

147
00:13:50,854 --> 00:13:51,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

148
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:52,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Peter, I will.

149
00:13:53,856 --> 00:13:59,779
[SPEAKER_00]: So we very early started ordering PPE as recommended by the Department of Ed.

150
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,763
[SPEAKER_00]: To date, we have bought 15,000 adult masks.

151
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:11,967
[SPEAKER_00]: We've bought over 6,000 child-sized masks.

152
00:14:12,627 --> 00:14:16,890
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are for children who either soil or forget a mask during this

153
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:22,432
[SPEAKER_00]: during the school day and we'll be able to replace that for them.

154
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:28,534
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bought face shields so that every educator will have a face shield.

155
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:34,956
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought some acrylic desk shields that we will give to the K-1 students.

156
00:14:37,137 --> 00:14:38,378
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see, what else?

157
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:43,781
[SPEAKER_00]: We have bought lots of cleaning supplies, including wipes, cleaning solutions.

158
00:14:44,681 --> 00:15:01,250
[SPEAKER_00]: John McLaughlin, the director of buildings and grounds has bought electrostatic sprayers so that rooms can be cleaned every single day and sometimes in between the days, in between the school day, depending on whatever's going on in the classroom.

159
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:03,511
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

160
00:15:05,289 --> 00:15:07,391
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think we're in pretty good shape.

161
00:15:07,411 --> 00:15:12,395
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of PPE articles that have been backordered.

162
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:14,776
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect them to be in by the time school starts.

163
00:15:15,797 --> 00:15:20,441
[SPEAKER_00]: The nurses have been preparing training modules for our staff and students.

164
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:26,665
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been working on the different protocols, customizing them from DESE to the Medford campus.

165
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:32,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Ms.

166
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:33,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Ray.

167
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:37,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just pull up a question here.

168
00:15:47,936 --> 00:15:54,461
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's, Maria, so how we're going to communicate is right now we are, sorry, that's the wrong question.

169
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,203
[SPEAKER_07]: They're coming in fast and furious.

170
00:15:58,885 --> 00:16:01,768
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question was how are we going to communicate answers to questions?

171
00:16:02,468 --> 00:16:13,018
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the way we're going to communicate answers to question is we're going to take all the information that's coming in and we're going to compile a frequently asked questions document.

172
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:16,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, all the questions will be available to everybody to see.

173
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:23,327
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, we're going to strip away people's private information, emails, names, all that type of stuff.

174
00:16:24,227 --> 00:16:29,691
[SPEAKER_07]: But we want to be 100% transparent, given the amount of questions that we're receiving.

175
00:16:30,191 --> 00:16:38,757
[SPEAKER_07]: And just, you know, given the uncertainty of everything, we want to make sure that we are really well aware of everything that's going on.

176
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:47,963
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Joan, would you like to speak to special education quickly?

177
00:16:51,109 --> 00:17:05,784
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, so we've been working closely with all the team members of the subcommittees to look at our special education population and make sure that we're meeting their needs, both in the remote plan, the hybrid plan.

178
00:17:05,804 --> 00:17:14,513
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're also following DESE's guidelines regarding identifying our highest needs students to provide some in-person

179
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:18,017
[SPEAKER_09]: instruction and related services.

180
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:31,463
[SPEAKER_09]: So we continue to work on that with the special education team and we will have more information as we complete that and identify what that specific model will look like for our special education students.

181
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:51,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So Tony, just curious, how many guest shields have we ordered?

182
00:17:51,170 --> 00:18:00,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a second, I'll pull up that inventory list because we've ordered so many different things, it's blurred in my mind.

183
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:04,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, we have quite the assortment of PPE coming in.

184
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:19,711
[SPEAKER_07]: So those desk shields are going to be for grades K and 1 primarily, and for students who really need them because of the inability to wear a mask because of a documented medical issue or disability.

185
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:23,213
[SPEAKER_07]: So once again, documented medical issue or disability.

186
00:18:23,794 --> 00:18:25,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Wearing masks is fundamentally critical,

187
00:18:26,876 --> 00:18:33,239
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are currently now reconsidering a portion of the draft that spoke about kindergarten and first graders not wearing them.

188
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,484
[SPEAKER_07]: We've received a lot of feedback from families really asking that K and one wear those masks.

189
00:18:41,584 --> 00:18:43,686
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is something that we're going to consider, Tony.

190
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:55,900
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to add, Peter, that the important thing for the K1 and 2 students, they're the students we bought the desk shields for, is that those students are learning phonics.

191
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:09,185
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very important that children's faces can be seen by the teacher, and the teacher will have an acrylic face shield so the children can see their face as they speak.

192
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:15,229
[SPEAKER_00]: we thought that was important educationally and developmentally to meet those students' needs.

193
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:28,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Stacey, would you like to address SEL?

194
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:46,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I think just overall that everyone in any of these reopening task force groups understands that this is an incredibly emotional time.

195
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:48,423
[SPEAKER_02]: It's riddled with anxiety.

196
00:19:49,764 --> 00:19:58,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Students have been through a lot, families have been through a lot, and we are taking all of that into consideration in terms of what is best

197
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:01,772
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to support families in any way.

198
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:09,378
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the major areas we're planning on focusing on is especially with routines and executive functioning.

199
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:16,803
[SPEAKER_02]: So executive functioning is how to organize your work, how to follow a schedule, how to create routines for yourself.

200
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:20,648
[SPEAKER_02]: how to manage all of those organizational tasks.

201
00:20:21,228 --> 00:20:29,414
[SPEAKER_02]: And in any of the reopening plans, we have added additional time in both for students, for staff, as well as for families.

202
00:20:30,254 --> 00:20:38,019
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone is able to have an opportunity to be on the same page and to get additional instruction in those areas specifically.

203
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:46,224
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also be adding a lot more counseling opportunities for students, not only small individual

204
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:57,911
[SPEAKER_02]: lessons in the classrooms for SEL with more morning meetings and advisories at the secondary level, but we're also will be adding more group counseling for students.

205
00:20:58,731 --> 00:21:06,113
[SPEAKER_02]: And those group counseling lessons will be based in cognitive behavioral therapy, focusing mainly on depression, anxiety, as well as trauma.

206
00:21:11,795 --> 00:21:12,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

207
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:14,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me pull up the next question here.

208
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:16,576
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about the upcoming survey

209
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,686
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to throw it to Dr. Edward Vincent.

210
00:21:23,428 --> 00:21:26,290
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, what information will be asked in a survey?

211
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:39,982
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to be surveying you once we will be sending out the survey, once we get our plan approved, and we're going to be seeking information about what plan you intend on

212
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:47,898
[SPEAKER_03]: as a parent, what you would be liking for your particular family, for your child or for your children.

213
00:21:47,918 --> 00:22:07,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there some, not to have it official, but if there were to be a potential concern medically, things that we might need to take into consideration, technology needs, such as do you have a device?

214
00:22:07,928 --> 00:22:09,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have connectivity?

215
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:14,000
[SPEAKER_03]: and the ability to possibly print.

216
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:17,786
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just trying to figure that out.

217
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:20,069
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also looking into transportation.

218
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:24,296
[SPEAKER_03]: What were your plans for transportation about next year?

219
00:22:25,405 --> 00:22:28,467
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are finalizing that survey.

220
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:35,550
[SPEAKER_03]: And Georgiana was asking whether it would be done on SurveyMonkey as opposed to Google Forms.

221
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,312
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for putting that suggestion forward.

222
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:43,254
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first time that someone asked about SurveyMonkey.

223
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:53,619
[SPEAKER_03]: But we definitely want it in a format that we'll be able to get names and be able to get an idea of

224
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,940
[SPEAKER_03]: the interest.

225
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:04,584
[SPEAKER_03]: So once that comes forward, when we send out the survey, it will be emailed, you'll get a robocall.

226
00:23:05,164 --> 00:23:17,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, please, please, I'm going to ask everyone to fill out that survey because we need that information to further and better inform our next steps so that we'll be able to have a strong opening of school.

227
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,850
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

228
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:25,212
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we want to also give a chance for Mr. Teixeira to speak as well.

229
00:23:25,392 --> 00:23:27,855
[SPEAKER_07]: We are having some connectivity issues for some of our people.

230
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:37,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Johnson and Mr. McLaughlin, they've been in and out, so we'll have them in momentarily to speak, but wanted to throw it to Mr. Teixeira.

231
00:23:39,907 --> 00:23:44,713
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're designing the EL program to mirror what the mainstream students are doing.

232
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:55,945
[SPEAKER_01]: DESE has not supplied us with specific guidance in relation to English learners, except for those English learners who are also duly identified as having an IEP.

233
00:23:57,246 --> 00:24:08,017
[SPEAKER_01]: So once that guidance comes through, if we need to shift what the plan is for all students to accommodate DESE's requirements for ELs, then we'll do that.

234
00:24:08,137 --> 00:24:21,450
[SPEAKER_01]: But for right now, we're sticking to the plan the way it's been written, and all EL families will have the same options as all the other students to choose remote, you know, or on what the model is that we go.

235
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:39,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I can also speak a little bit to the hybrid model while we're waiting.

236
00:24:51,095 --> 00:24:57,636
[SPEAKER_01]: We put together a hybrid model that would follow the same schedule for elementary, middle, and high school.

237
00:24:58,277 --> 00:25:01,077
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two days of in-person instruction.

238
00:25:01,577 --> 00:25:06,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Students will be divided into a cohort, either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2.

239
00:25:07,438 --> 00:25:09,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Cohort 1 will meet on Mondays and Tuesdays.

240
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Cohort 2 will meet on Thursdays and Fridays for live in-person.

241
00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:30,319
[SPEAKER_01]: On Wednesday, that's when the teachers will do live remote learning to bring the two cohorts together as a full class, because the goal is that we will be returning to school and students will have the opportunity to know who is in their class.

242
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:40,748
[SPEAKER_01]: On the days that students are working from home, they will be doing asynchronous learning and dependent learning from their teachers, but it will be the same curriculum.

243
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:44,411
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be a separate enrichment.

244
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:50,476
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be following the curriculum that has been laid out by grade level and subject matter.

245
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:54,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

246
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:55,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

247
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:57,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I was having a little bit of technical difficulty there.

248
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a question here about, is this the final version of the plan?

249
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,772
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to throw that back to our superintendent.

250
00:26:04,966 --> 00:26:09,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So the plan that was submitted on Friday was our draft.

251
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:15,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's session, tomorrow's session, we have another listening session in the morning.

252
00:26:15,772 --> 00:26:17,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Thursday we have school committee meeting.

253
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:29,820
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we take the feedback and we look at the FAQ and receive feedback from school committee on Thursday, then at that point in time, we will take all of the feedback

254
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:37,262
[SPEAKER_03]: and be prepared to submit a final plan to DESE on Monday.

255
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:43,544
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say maybe we are 80% there.

256
00:26:43,564 --> 00:26:46,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on this feedback that we receive,

257
00:26:47,365 --> 00:26:54,150
[SPEAKER_03]: And final guidance from the school committee on Thursday, we'll be able to make the deadline of next Monday, August 10.

258
00:26:55,231 --> 00:27:02,075
[SPEAKER_03]: And just for the record, for the audience to know, we are going to be impact bargaining with the teachers union this week.

259
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:07,179
[SPEAKER_03]: We're scheduled to impact bargain on Tuesday and Thursday of this week.

260
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:21,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Since this is a plan, but it's a change in working conditions, and so Massachusetts general law clearly states that if there's a change in working conditions, then it's subject to collective bargaining.

261
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:29,306
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to have impact bargaining sessions to talk about how this plan will potentially change

262
00:27:31,787 --> 00:27:34,948
[SPEAKER_03]: working conditions that teachers are normally accustomed to.

263
00:27:35,408 --> 00:27:49,773
[SPEAKER_03]: So when all of those pieces, additional pieces of information are added to our 3D puzzle, then we'll be able to move forward with our final plan.

264
00:27:50,113 --> 00:27:50,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

265
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:58,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm gonna bring in, hopefully, our facilities director, John McLaughlin.

266
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:03,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, he is currently, uh, in an unsecure location for internet.

267
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, hopefully, uh, we are successful here.

268
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:11,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Mr. McLaughlin, we've had a lot of questions about ventilation and HVAC and those types of things.

269
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:16,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you address, um, the steps that we've already taken on the steps that we're going to be taking?

270
00:28:26,215 --> 00:28:27,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. McLaughlin, are you able to help out?

271
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,611
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, we're going to, uh, we're going to come back to Mr. McLaughlin in just a little bit.

272
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:44,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and we will try Mr. Johnson, Mr. Johnson just wanted to have you, um, you know, add anything you can to our process thus far.

273
00:28:44,993 --> 00:28:47,694
[SPEAKER_07]: We lost Mr. Johnson, that pesky internet, I'm telling you.

274
00:28:48,254 --> 00:28:50,595
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can speak briefly about HVAC.

275
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:57,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, actually Mr. Drobnek, who was just, uh, comment was featured has been working on the operations team and has been a tremendous help.

276
00:28:58,781 --> 00:29:04,686
[SPEAKER_07]: And he has really, uh, really been, uh, focused on the safety of our students and our staff.

277
00:29:05,546 --> 00:29:19,157
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, we are working right now with our in-house, um, staff as well as our, um, an outside contractor to be going through our ventilation systems and Mr. McLaughlin is back in.

278
00:29:19,197 --> 00:29:22,960
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to give him another try because he knows far more than I do about it.

279
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:24,481
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. McLaughlin.

280
00:29:25,842 --> 00:29:26,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give it another shot.

281
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Any luck, Mr. McLaughlin?

282
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,603
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, that's all right.

283
00:29:38,663 --> 00:29:42,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are currently assessing all the filters in the district.

284
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:47,529
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking at ways that we can provide maximum ventilation.

285
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:51,912
[SPEAKER_07]: As the plan states, running our system 23 hours a day.

286
00:29:52,692 --> 00:29:58,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Desi is asking for two hours before and two hours after occupancy.

287
00:29:59,036 --> 00:30:02,098
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking to run our systems for 23 hours a day.

288
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,981
[SPEAKER_07]: really can't run them 24 hours a day.

289
00:30:07,262 --> 00:30:14,547
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are really going to be focusing on maximum ventilation in our vocational shops.

290
00:30:15,248 --> 00:30:19,751
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to be building frames to put in the bay doors.

291
00:30:20,878 --> 00:30:23,340
[SPEAKER_07]: so that there's maximum exhaust.

292
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:41,293
[SPEAKER_07]: We're taking an assessment and a survey of our teachers to let us know if they have issues with their windows so we can get those repaired or at least get them operational and trying to get as much ventilation as possible into our buildings.

293
00:30:42,192 --> 00:30:51,996
[SPEAKER_07]: We've allotted some of the funds that we've gotten from the state and federal governments to try to repair these.

294
00:30:52,517 --> 00:31:04,022
[SPEAKER_07]: There are certain limitations though with how the systems were designed and we will put the best filters in we can for those systems.

295
00:31:05,082 --> 00:31:09,004
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you cannot install filters that were not designed

296
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:22,805
[SPEAKER_07]: because then you'll have wear and tear on motors, parts, pulleys, and different things like that that will be very, that would be worse than not having the cycling of the filters.

297
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:30,950
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's go to, and any one of our panelists can jump into this, but I'll start with Suzanne.

298
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about asynchronous.

299
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:34,632
[SPEAKER_07]: What does asynchronous mean?

300
00:31:36,331 --> 00:31:44,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so one of the things that we are also working on is creating a list of terminology that will be helpful for students and families.

301
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:56,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Asynchronous means that they are live or as, excuse me, recorded lessons, or as Mr. Teixeira said, he referred to them as independent learning time.

302
00:31:57,462 --> 00:32:06,404
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is asynchronous lessons that teachers have prepared will be blocks of time that are either independent to work on assignments ongoing,

303
00:32:07,362 --> 00:32:18,452
[SPEAKER_10]: especially at the secondary level, and it also may include some recorded lessons, either from the teacher or another professional outlet, in order to teach students new material.

304
00:32:19,793 --> 00:32:28,697
[SPEAKER_10]: The opposite of that is synchronous, which means live lessons that the teacher does virtually in real time with his or her students.

305
00:32:29,678 --> 00:32:41,683
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you had heard in the introductions that Stacey, Joan, and Paul were all involved in the instructional work groups, if either of them want to chime in, another way to explain it, please do.

306
00:32:41,803 --> 00:32:43,024
[SPEAKER_10]: If not, hopefully that's helpful.

307
00:32:43,864 --> 00:32:44,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

308
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:50,089
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so give me a second to just look through a few more questions.

309
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for all the questions that you are sending to us.

310
00:32:56,992 --> 00:32:58,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, really, really appreciate it.

311
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:15,074
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question is, is there any way to get AC in the high school, wearing a mask in the heat is going to be difficult.

312
00:33:15,754 --> 00:33:19,735
[SPEAKER_07]: So we fully respect that that is going to be a challenge.

313
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:31,398
[SPEAKER_07]: The costs and the timeline to do that, unfortunately, would probably not be feasible.

314
00:33:33,486 --> 00:33:35,669
[SPEAKER_07]: even in the past few months that we had.

315
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:41,694
[SPEAKER_07]: So at this time, getting air conditioning into high school is not really feasible.

316
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:50,303
[SPEAKER_07]: We are looking into multiple options to try to give maximum ventilation to all of our staff and students.

317
00:33:58,117 --> 00:33:58,397
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

318
00:33:58,517 --> 00:33:59,939
[SPEAKER_07]: So how will lunch work?

319
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:07,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to see if, um, so I know Tony Ray was on the operations committee with me and she can definitely help me out with this.

320
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:15,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we're going to be looking at, um, well, we're going to need some volunteers, um, parent volunteers.

321
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:16,253
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so.

322
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:26,401
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be putting that out in a call as well, because we're going to have to have students sometimes eating in classrooms, sometimes eating outside when the weather is nice.

323
00:34:27,662 --> 00:34:37,812
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be really trying to have it be as touch-free as possible, so it'll be more than likely grab-and-go brown bag lunches for students.

324
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:55,424
[SPEAKER_07]: We are well aware of students allergy concerns and we'll be working with all the people to make sure that we are really focused on making sure that allergy bullying and other situations like that are well considered.

325
00:34:55,945 --> 00:34:57,866
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've also got Tony here.

326
00:34:57,906 --> 00:34:58,947
[SPEAKER_07]: So would you like to jump in?

327
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:05,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Peter, you're exactly right.

328
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:13,334
[SPEAKER_00]: The nurses will continue to follow all of our normal protocols for allergy management and medication administration.

329
00:35:14,314 --> 00:35:16,295
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't expect that to be disrupted.

330
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:19,577
[SPEAKER_00]: Students will be eating in their classrooms.

331
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:24,059
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a time when they can take off their masks and have a little mask break.

332
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:37,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just felt that that's the best way to keep the cohort small and limit any amount of exposure to other cohorts.

333
00:35:37,628 --> 00:35:45,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Tony, we have another question for you coming up on the screen right now about daily temp checks and a health questionnaire before entering the building.

334
00:35:49,845 --> 00:36:01,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the Department of Public Health has determined that the daily temperature checks will not be a measure that the school staff will be implementing.

335
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:11,540
[SPEAKER_00]: What we and the Department of Public Health are asking is that families check their prior to coming to school in the morning.

336
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:25,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we will be posting and giving you a list of symptoms as a coven symptom tracker that you can follow children that have any of the symptoms should be staying home.

337
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:31,692
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that we're doing is partnering with a local software company.

338
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:41,815
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will have availability for parents to fill out a mobile symptom tracker app on their mobile device.

339
00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:53,879
[SPEAKER_00]: And going through a series of questions, the app will tell you if it is safe to come to school or if you should be staying home.

340
00:36:56,446 --> 00:36:59,527
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way we're approaching it.

341
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:05,489
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a protocol that's approved by Department of Public Health, and we feel that will meet everybody's best needs.

342
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:13,611
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most important thing is if you do not feel well in the morning or the evening before school, do not come to school.

343
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:21,793
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more important that you stay home and take care of yourself and limit the exposure of your germs to other people.

344
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:23,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you very much, Tony.

345
00:37:23,793 --> 00:37:28,074
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take a question right now about how course assignments happen for the high school.

346
00:37:28,154 --> 00:37:31,055
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are going to happen as normal.

347
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:34,796
[SPEAKER_07]: AP and honors classes will still be available.

348
00:37:36,096 --> 00:37:42,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're right now working through if any particular courses will be hybrid or remote only.

349
00:37:43,899 --> 00:38:05,012
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't believe that is the case, but I will double check with the instructional team, whose members are on the call with me right now, Joan Bowen, Stacey Shulman, and Suzanne Galussi, if you guys want to jump in on specific courses being remote, but AP and honors will happen as usual, as much as can be usual in the pandemic.

350
00:38:05,813 --> 00:38:12,377
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is one, yes, I was just going to say, I would like to throw this one to Stacey Shulman, because she has that secondary expertise.

351
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:14,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

352
00:38:14,689 --> 00:38:19,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to mention that we will still be having AP and honors courses.

353
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,731
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be working with the college board very shortly.

354
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:24,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Teachers will be building their AP syllabus.

355
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:29,792
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have all of those approved ahead of time, regardless of if we're hybrid or remote.

356
00:38:30,733 --> 00:38:33,053
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those will be available for students.

357
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:34,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

358
00:38:36,094 --> 00:38:42,135
[SPEAKER_07]: And so a question that we're receiving from a lot of parents also is for their vocationally enrolled children.

359
00:38:42,991 --> 00:38:45,512
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is not falling off our radar.

360
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:47,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Stacey, you can jump in here as well.

361
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:51,653
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you, Kathy Kretz, member of the school committee, for this question.

362
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:57,855
[SPEAKER_07]: We will be definitely making sure that our students are earning their proper hours for CTE.

363
00:38:58,315 --> 00:39:00,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Stacey, I don't know if you have anything to add on that, but.

364
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:01,315
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

365
00:39:01,435 --> 00:39:12,098
[SPEAKER_02]: So Chad Fallon and Alice Beth Fitzpatrick put together a nice memo regarding if we were to be all remote, which is obviously of high concern for folks in the vocational program.

366
00:39:12,628 --> 00:39:18,813
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll also be working diligently with them to create a robust hybrid model as well.

367
00:39:22,575 --> 00:39:25,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Joan, do you have anything else that you'd like to add around this area?

368
00:39:26,258 --> 00:39:36,566
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I was just going to say the same thing that Stacy had said, that they are looking at trying to look at different ways to provide the in-person for the CTE hour requirements.

369
00:39:36,946 --> 00:39:38,407
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's still a work in progress.

370
00:39:40,235 --> 00:39:58,307
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to mention that there was a telephone call with the Commissioner of Education today, Jeff Riley, and there were some questions asking about grading, pass, fail, and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education understands that an emergency closure of schools in March

371
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,551
[SPEAKER_07]: created a lot of upheaval for a lot of people.

372
00:40:02,011 --> 00:40:06,712
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education wants to return to normalcy as much as possible.

373
00:40:07,532 --> 00:40:15,115
[SPEAKER_07]: And he mentioned today that there will be attendance taken, there will be grades and not pass fail.

374
00:40:15,655 --> 00:40:26,478
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is really going to be a hawk-like focus on time on learning to ensure that our students are not having gaps that were a natural consequence of

375
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:28,920
[SPEAKER_07]: the abrupt closure last year.

376
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:37,788
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I just wanna make sure that everybody understands that there will be attendance, there will be checks on student learning, there will be grades.

377
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:50,320
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have any update on MCAS at this point or anything like that, except that as of right now for FY, for this coming year, it is on as scheduled.

378
00:40:51,534 --> 00:40:53,476
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are looking at that.

379
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:58,759
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if any of the other panelists who are currently on screen would like to add to that.

380
00:41:03,301 --> 00:41:06,503
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll bring Tom in as well, but if anyone wants to add to that.

381
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:14,788
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me just look at here.

382
00:41:24,187 --> 00:41:25,568
[SPEAKER_07]: So, here's a question.

383
00:41:25,588 --> 00:41:30,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, they come so fast, sometimes you can't get the question you were going for.

384
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:33,673
[SPEAKER_07]: So, how will teachers be trained in time?

385
00:41:34,454 --> 00:41:36,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Many of us are going to be able to jump in on that one.

386
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:43,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Through negotiations with the major teachers unions in the state and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education,

387
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:55,765
[SPEAKER_07]: The first 10 days of what would have been the academic year, so academic years in Massachusetts are 180 days, mandated state requirement of 900 hours for elementary and 990 hours for secondary.

388
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:12,697
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are right now being granted by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education the first 10 days to appropriately train our teachers prior to the start of the school year.

389
00:42:13,238 --> 00:42:18,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And would anybody else like to jump in on that as well to talk about what some of those trainings might be?

390
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:21,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I can talk a little bit about that.

391
00:42:21,404 --> 00:42:23,145
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on the Professional Development Committee.

392
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:36,327
[SPEAKER_01]: So prior to getting these 10 days, the district was proactive by switching out the November PD day and making that happen in August.

393
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:45,678
[SPEAKER_01]: So our teachers could do some online training on remote teaching, hybrid teaching, asynchronous learning for students as well.

394
00:42:46,218 --> 00:42:53,367
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's through an organization called Better Lessons, and teachers have signed up for three two-hour workshops.

395
00:42:54,067 --> 00:43:03,859
[SPEAKER_01]: And then beyond those three two-hour workshops, teachers have access to coaches through Better Lessons to support the learning that they did in their professional development.

396
00:43:04,651 --> 00:43:07,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will go through pretty much to the end of October.

397
00:43:07,612 --> 00:43:20,279
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting those extra 10 days at the beginning of the year will allow us to strengthen that and provide some additional PD options for the teachers to prepare for what the new school year is going to look like.

398
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,981
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll address them.

399
00:43:25,861 --> 00:43:26,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, John.

400
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:26,862
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

401
00:43:28,852 --> 00:43:35,978
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to add that the paraprofessionals within the district will also be receiving the professional development through better lessons as well.

402
00:43:36,998 --> 00:43:43,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, to add on to that, it's not just teachers, it's teachers, paraprofessionals and all administrators as well.

403
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:47,006
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the entire district that will be getting this professional development.

404
00:43:48,808 --> 00:43:53,772
[SPEAKER_00]: School nurses and counselors included in that professional development.

405
00:43:54,192 --> 00:43:55,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to mention that

406
00:43:57,347 --> 00:44:16,258
[SPEAKER_00]: The school nurses have worked very hard on training materials for the staff, which we will be telling them about COVID-19, how it's transmitted, how to identify a sick child in class, and then how to make the appropriate referral to the nurses' offices.

407
00:44:17,499 --> 00:44:28,391
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also worked on training materials for students, so they will learn about how to keep themselves healthy, how to hand wash correctly, how to wear a face mask correctly.

408
00:44:29,472 --> 00:44:36,800
[SPEAKER_00]: And that training has been separated out into developmental levels, the elementary level, and then the middle school, high school level.

409
00:44:41,241 --> 00:44:41,561
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

410
00:44:42,062 --> 00:44:46,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know, Stacey, I know you have some trainings coming up as well.

411
00:44:49,647 --> 00:44:49,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

412
00:44:50,027 --> 00:45:02,756
[SPEAKER_02]: So additional trainings we'll be offering outside of better lessons include training on responsive classroom for elementary faculty, especially around how to run a supportive morning meeting.

413
00:45:03,956 --> 00:45:07,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we continued throughout the pandemic.

414
00:45:07,779 --> 00:45:15,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we first closed in March, we started to offer training on mindfulness to faculty as well as psychological first aid.

415
00:45:16,328 --> 00:45:30,240
[SPEAKER_02]: We will also be providing trainings on strategies to engage students in a remote classroom, as well as strategies to engage students in general, just after the six month closure of COVID-19.

416
00:45:30,741 --> 00:45:36,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, some things that students may present with that could have been different compared to other school opening years.

417
00:45:37,126 --> 00:45:48,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Our clinical counseling staff has also been trained highly on anxiety and will there will be many of them who will be able to become certified adolescent and child anxiety specialists.

418
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:57,203
[SPEAKER_02]: We will also be providing extensive training on trauma to our staff as well so that they can become child and adolescent trauma specialists.

419
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:05,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be looking at different models for how to run those group counseling sessions that I mentioned earlier.

420
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,831
[SPEAKER_02]: A few of those is one is called CBITS and another is Bounce Back.

421
00:46:10,751 --> 00:46:14,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bounce Back is for elementary age students.

422
00:46:14,952 --> 00:46:18,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And the CBITS is for students at the middle and high school level.

423
00:46:19,533 --> 00:46:26,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is groups to come together and overcome challenges related to trauma.

424
00:46:28,843 --> 00:46:29,123
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

425
00:46:29,783 --> 00:46:30,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

426
00:46:30,564 --> 00:46:31,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Really appreciate that.

427
00:46:32,464 --> 00:46:33,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, hold on.

428
00:46:33,084 --> 00:46:41,847
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to find the, um, so, uh, let's go to a question about nurses offices.

429
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:46,409
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, Tony, there are actually two questions relating to nurses.

430
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:49,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the first, hold on.

431
00:46:49,149 --> 00:46:52,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to find it here because they are coming in fast and furious.

432
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:53,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,

433
00:46:57,216 --> 00:47:06,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so here's one of the questions about the satellite nursing spaces and do we have enough nursing staff in the district?

434
00:47:08,845 --> 00:47:13,328
[SPEAKER_00]: So satellite nursing stations will be opened in every single building.

435
00:47:13,808 --> 00:47:23,616
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be an area where we can safely isolate students who present with illness symptoms before they are picked up by a parent.

436
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:28,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we do have enough nursing staff in the system.

437
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:37,363
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very fortunate that most of our buildings, I should say, have multiple nurses in the buildings.

438
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:47,748
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are able to then assign somebody to be in the satellite office supervising and assessing students before they go home.

439
00:47:49,288 --> 00:47:59,791
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case that we have nurses out because they've been exposed and they've been sick, we will be using per diem nursing staff to fill those gaps.

440
00:48:05,212 --> 00:48:17,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got a lot of questions back to back here about the expectation of parents during the remote part of the schedule, particularly as many have already or will also be returning to work full time.

441
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:24,265
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll invite any of our panelists to jump in on this definitely hot button and interesting topic.

442
00:48:33,893 --> 00:48:38,677
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we recognize this is a challenge for all families, whether we do a hybrid

443
00:48:39,652 --> 00:48:49,874
[SPEAKER_01]: If we did half days, if we did two and a half days, if, you know, half, five days, half, you know, in the morning, half in the afternoon, there's no ideal scenario that works for all families.

444
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:52,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and I'm just going to piggyback on that.

445
00:48:53,895 --> 00:49:03,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of us on this panel are working parents ourselves, so we can truly appreciate the hardship that this puts, this whole situation puts on families.

446
00:49:04,177 --> 00:49:05,917
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just felt that that was important to say.

447
00:49:06,718 --> 00:49:08,278
[SPEAKER_10]: In terms of the remote model,

448
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:21,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I think part of what Dr. Cushing had said before and part of all the feedback that we've been receiving through various outlets from the community is the need to have the remote model.

449
00:49:22,697 --> 00:49:25,941
[SPEAKER_10]: as close as possible mirror a typical school day.

450
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:34,610
[SPEAKER_10]: So the remote situation that you were all thrust into last spring is not going to look the same as we reopen schools in the fall.

451
00:49:35,111 --> 00:49:41,878
[SPEAKER_10]: So at every level, we have worked with our teams to create remote schedules that

452
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:45,780
[SPEAKER_10]: as close as we can align to a typical school day.

453
00:49:46,220 --> 00:50:03,003
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have, you will see that in our plan, because you can see that we have made sure that we give screen time breaks, but in the same time keep to a schedule that is reflective of a typical school day, starting somewhere, depending on the level, around 8 a.m.

454
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:06,264
[SPEAKER_10]: and finishing somewhere, depending on the level, about 2 p.m.

455
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:09,265
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody wants to chime in, they can.

456
00:50:09,325 --> 00:50:10,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully that answers your question.

457
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:18,704
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I want to add on to that is we do not expect students to be on the screen that entire time.

458
00:50:19,284 --> 00:50:23,166
[SPEAKER_02]: And our expectation for screen time will be dependent on the level of the students.

459
00:50:23,626 --> 00:50:36,633
[SPEAKER_02]: So a kindergarten student is not expected to remain online for as long during a synchronous Zoom class, video class, as we would expect perhaps a fifth grader or a middle school or high school student.

460
00:50:36,653 --> 00:50:39,394
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of those developmental considerations were taken into account.

461
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think that addresses to this question here from Brian Kilfoyle.

462
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:52,405
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we're not expecting kids to be on their computers for hours and hours a day.

463
00:50:53,506 --> 00:50:54,546
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a part of it.

464
00:50:55,007 --> 00:50:58,889
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, students need to have experiential learning as well.

465
00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:05,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to make sure that we're providing options for parents who are choosing to keep their children home remotely.

466
00:51:06,916 --> 00:51:10,377
[SPEAKER_07]: I also want to bring up another point here about the 10 days at the start.

467
00:51:11,518 --> 00:51:18,220
[SPEAKER_07]: So, some districts aren't using all 10 days at the beginning of the school year would it make sense to save some of the PDA days for later in the year.

468
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,861
[SPEAKER_07]: If the instructional model needs to switch quickly.

469
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:30,664
[SPEAKER_07]: We would have actually loved to have done that, but the Department of Elementary and Secondary Ed has mandated that those 10 days must be used at the start of the year.

470
00:51:31,445 --> 00:51:40,408
[SPEAKER_07]: This question was asked numerous times on the commissioner's call today, and we were planning on trying to split them in case of a transition.

471
00:51:41,508 --> 00:51:49,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully a vaccine comes out or treatments make it so that we can move to more of a normal school year.

472
00:51:50,101 --> 00:52:05,892
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately, Christina, the districts that had planned to do that have to change their plans because it was quite clear from the commissioner today that those days are to be used up front.

473
00:52:08,713 --> 00:52:11,815
[SPEAKER_06]: So- I can just add one thing in on that too.

474
00:52:12,316 --> 00:52:13,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Christina, that's a great question.

475
00:52:13,457 --> 00:52:18,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And one spot of wiggle room that the commissioner note on the call today is if districts already have

476
00:52:19,144 --> 00:52:22,285
[SPEAKER_06]: two or three PD days built into their calendar to start the year.

477
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:25,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And then now they have the 10 additional days here.

478
00:52:26,007 --> 00:52:35,671
[SPEAKER_06]: There is some wiggle room on, you know, should you repurpose those two or three days at the beginning of the schedule and then start right away with these 10 days that were sort of mandated by the state.

479
00:52:35,771 --> 00:52:41,153
[SPEAKER_06]: So looking at school schedule, there is just that little bit of flexibility depending how the schedule looked.

480
00:52:41,693 --> 00:52:48,256
[SPEAKER_06]: But as Dr. Cushing said, all the 10 days that were designated a before school PD have to be used before the start of the school year.

481
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:53,261
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Tony, I've got another nursing question for you.

482
00:52:54,541 --> 00:52:58,062
[SPEAKER_07]: What happens if a child in your classroom is diagnosed with COVID?

483
00:53:00,523 --> 00:53:04,363
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I guess I should ask for a little clarification.

484
00:53:04,423 --> 00:53:08,064
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this another child, not your own child, correct?

485
00:53:08,764 --> 00:53:10,405
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say that would be another child.

486
00:53:12,961 --> 00:53:13,141
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

487
00:53:13,461 --> 00:53:26,088
[SPEAKER_00]: So once a child is diagnosed with COVID, we will hear from the Medford Board of Health through their contact tracing of the positive test results.

488
00:53:26,508 --> 00:53:32,911
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the nurses will do is determine who are the closest contacts in the classroom.

489
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:38,394
[SPEAKER_00]: And once that has been established,

490
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:54,731
[SPEAKER_00]: likely all the children will be sent on to, you know, asked to be, go to their doctor to be checked for COVID so that we can check, make sure that it hasn't spread throughout the classroom.

491
00:53:55,092 --> 00:53:59,714
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all likelihood, an elementary classroom especially would be closed down.

492
00:54:03,863 --> 00:54:08,207
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it will cause a ripple through the classroom.

493
00:54:08,247 --> 00:54:14,392
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are going, we are always focusing on the safety and health of every student and staff member in the class.

494
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:17,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

495
00:54:17,695 --> 00:54:19,457
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you very much, Tony.

496
00:54:19,477 --> 00:54:21,138
[SPEAKER_07]: We also had a question.

497
00:54:21,259 --> 00:54:24,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to find it on my screen about the,

498
00:54:27,224 --> 00:54:29,146
[SPEAKER_07]: What was I going to say?

499
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:40,913
[SPEAKER_07]: The transmission rate and closure, those things are going to be established by DESE slash the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, correct?

500
00:54:41,453 --> 00:54:42,694
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Peter.

501
00:54:43,835 --> 00:54:45,376
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Department of Public Health

502
00:54:45,985 --> 00:54:56,293
[SPEAKER_00]: closely follows all the public health metrics, which are the amount of positive cases in a community, the number of deaths, and the number of hospitalizations.

503
00:54:56,894 --> 00:55:06,702
[SPEAKER_00]: At any time, the Department of Public Health, working with Governor Baker, they can decide if our transmission rate in Medford reaches

504
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:10,489
[SPEAKER_00]: on a certain level, they can shut down the schools again.

505
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:16,441
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires very close monitoring of all of those public health metrics.

506
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:20,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

507
00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:22,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

508
00:55:23,072 --> 00:55:25,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Ladies and gentlemen, I really appreciate all the questions that are coming in.

509
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:29,314
[SPEAKER_07]: We have 343 people on the call.

510
00:55:29,774 --> 00:55:31,295
[SPEAKER_07]: We could not have done that with the Zoom.

511
00:55:33,056 --> 00:55:39,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, thank you for so much of the questions that is here.

512
00:55:41,633 --> 00:55:54,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, Peter, I have another thing that a question that came into me by email, asking if a child has symptoms, what happens to his siblings who may be in the district.

513
00:55:54,259 --> 00:55:59,321
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a student is is presenting with symptoms and is going to be dismissed home.

514
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:07,146
[SPEAKER_00]: the building nurse will call the school nurses in the buildings of the other siblings.

515
00:56:07,426 --> 00:56:17,593
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would ask that those siblings are also picked up and checked by the primary care physician or by a testing site.

516
00:56:18,094 --> 00:56:24,038
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be siblings by virtue of your living arrangements would be considered close contacts.

517
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:33,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I wanna give John Bowen, our director of special education, a question here.

518
00:56:34,214 --> 00:56:36,035
[SPEAKER_07]: So speech and occupational therapy.

519
00:56:39,557 --> 00:56:48,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So at this time, speech and language, if we are in a hybrid, it depends on the remote learning plan that the school committee decides on.

520
00:56:48,762 --> 00:56:53,865
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's any opportunity for in-person during the hybrid, we would try to provide

521
00:56:54,448 --> 00:56:57,970
[SPEAKER_09]: those speech and occupational therapy in person.

522
00:56:59,191 --> 00:57:03,273
[SPEAKER_09]: It also depends if the student is identified as a high needs student.

523
00:57:03,813 --> 00:57:10,817
[SPEAKER_09]: If they are, then they would also be receiving in-person speech and OT occupational therapy this year.

524
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:16,761
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's fully remote, we would probably use telehealth.

525
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:21,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, that same as what we had used this year during the school closure.

526
00:57:23,578 --> 00:57:24,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

527
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:29,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And, John, you're still going to be on the answer seat there.

528
00:57:29,222 --> 00:57:31,684
[SPEAKER_07]: We have another one coming your way from another school committee member.

529
00:57:32,425 --> 00:57:34,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Melanie McLaughlin, for sending this in.

530
00:57:37,188 --> 00:57:44,274
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yes, so we are prioritizing students on IEPs with in-person learning.

531
00:57:45,478 --> 00:57:48,759
[SPEAKER_09]: Students with 504s who have needs, we are addressing those as well.

532
00:57:48,799 --> 00:58:05,062
[SPEAKER_09]: We would look at the criteria to see if they are also considered a high need student and what their services would look like and make sure that we are providing those students on 504s with the same services that they would require if they were in person in the district.

533
00:58:06,423 --> 00:58:06,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

534
00:58:06,743 --> 00:58:07,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

535
00:58:07,932 --> 00:58:10,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go to a question about high school bathrooms.

536
00:58:11,236 --> 00:58:14,499
[SPEAKER_07]: That has definitely been an issue over this first year of mine in Medford.

537
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:20,025
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are currently working with our facilities department to make sure that our bathrooms are up and running.

538
00:58:20,566 --> 00:58:24,189
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the questions that I've received numerous times is, will all bathrooms be open?

539
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:30,156
[SPEAKER_07]: With the exception of cleaning by our custodial staff, we will make sure that all bathrooms are open.

540
00:58:30,676 --> 00:58:42,581
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to work to also make sure that doors are pegged open so that high touch surfaces such as doorknobs and other things throughout our building are as open as possible while also following fire code.

541
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:59,747
[SPEAKER_07]: While speaking about fire code, emergency evacuations per conversations initially with our fire department and others really can have a social distance, but kids having their masks on, it is best for health and safety to evacuate buildings as quickly as possible.

542
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:04,152
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as our bathrooms, we will make sure that they are open and accessible.

543
00:59:04,612 --> 00:59:07,956
[SPEAKER_07]: We have literally hundreds of gallons of soap.

544
00:59:08,817 --> 00:59:12,582
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the cool foaming soap type that really makes your hands feel nice and clean.

545
00:59:13,177 --> 00:59:19,960
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have hundreds of gallons of it with more on order as well, so that we are well stocked, well provisioned.

546
00:59:20,401 --> 00:59:30,546
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those people who don't like hand sanitizer, we will have soap in every single elementary classroom, grade level classrooms, not the specialists, right, Ms.

547
00:59:30,586 --> 00:59:30,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Galussi?

548
00:59:31,994 --> 00:59:33,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, correct.

549
00:59:33,755 --> 00:59:52,601
[SPEAKER_10]: The buildings, elementary and middle school, although I'm sorry, I really can't speak totally to middle school, but I know the elementary classrooms have a sink in them, not maybe specialist classrooms and not service providers, although art rooms do have a sink in them, so students are able to wash their hands.

550
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:11,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter, may I also mention John McLaughlin has ordered classroom dispensers for hand sanitizer for every single classroom that will be installed in all of the rooms.

551
01:00:11,411 --> 01:00:16,432
[SPEAKER_00]: So for students who don't have a sink in the classroom, there will be hand sanitizer available.

552
01:00:19,153 --> 01:00:19,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

553
01:00:20,073 --> 01:00:20,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

554
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:24,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Just scrolling through some of the questions that have been coming in right now.

555
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:43,544
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what they call dead air, so I apologize.

556
01:00:54,111 --> 01:00:57,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so yes, to, we, we talked about the transmission rate earlier.

557
01:00:58,414 --> 01:01:03,957
[SPEAKER_07]: We will definitely let parents and guardians know what the transmission rate is for closure.

558
01:01:04,617 --> 01:01:07,599
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, that will definitely, um, be made well aware.

559
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:14,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and so once that number is set, we will make sure that that is definitely

560
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:25,274
[SPEAKER_07]: something that we are making well known to all families, guardians, staff, so that we have the opportunity to do that.

561
01:01:34,927 --> 01:01:37,670
[SPEAKER_03]: We just got another question as we're trying to scroll through.

562
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Charlene Douglas, our teachers union president.

563
01:01:41,534 --> 01:01:48,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Her question is if we need to go fully remote, could some of the 10 days be used to meet with students?

564
01:01:49,201 --> 01:01:51,883
[SPEAKER_03]: The teachers feel that this is extremely important.

565
01:01:52,364 --> 01:01:59,751
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as we, again, just continue to get new guidance today about the 10 days definitely needing to be frontloaded.

566
01:02:00,251 --> 01:02:07,395
[SPEAKER_03]: We could definitely look at how those days are going to be used in addition to adding the professional development.

567
01:02:08,035 --> 01:02:18,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, we do think it is critically important, whichever model ends up being the selected model, we would like the students to be able to have

568
01:02:18,761 --> 01:02:32,088
[SPEAKER_03]: some type of an opportunity for a physically distanced meeting opportunity, keeping everyone safe, but maybe an outdoor session.

569
01:02:32,189 --> 01:02:46,216
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something that we definitely can work on during those initial opening days of school so that students will at least be able and parents will be able to make a connection with the homeroom teacher.

570
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:47,497
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for that question.

571
01:02:51,743 --> 01:02:53,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Charlene, for sending it in.

572
01:02:59,037 --> 01:03:05,364
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a question that talks about extracurricular activities and want to extrapolate to athletics.

573
01:03:05,844 --> 01:03:19,297
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have an answer for athletics at this point with the exception of that the fall sports season per MIAA will not start.

574
01:03:20,058 --> 01:03:22,241
[SPEAKER_07]: prior to September 15th.

575
01:03:23,202 --> 01:03:25,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so that has been established by them.

576
01:03:25,786 --> 01:03:33,156
[SPEAKER_07]: It is, um, it is, you know, the, the MIA will be meeting in the coming weeks.

577
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:40,523
[SPEAKER_07]: but we do not know if there will be any further delays.

578
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:47,287
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, we also know that many students really thrive on athletics and extracurricular activities.

579
01:03:47,807 --> 01:03:55,131
[SPEAKER_07]: They provide a really strong connection with adults and provide students good connections with their peers outside of the classroom.

580
01:03:55,511 --> 01:04:00,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anybody else would like to jump in on, you know, that importance there that maybe,

581
01:04:02,659 --> 01:04:03,640
[SPEAKER_07]: that may be there, so.

582
01:04:08,662 --> 01:04:09,743
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

583
01:04:11,023 --> 01:04:12,604
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's see here.

584
01:04:13,505 --> 01:04:15,866
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had a lot of questions about masks come through.

585
01:04:16,767 --> 01:04:21,289
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to put one up right now, you know, about masks.

586
01:04:21,769 --> 01:04:25,211
[SPEAKER_07]: That wasn't the one I wanted, but Tony, do you want to speak about masks real quick?

587
01:04:27,752 --> 01:04:28,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you guys.

588
01:04:28,693 --> 01:04:30,494
[SPEAKER_00]: So masks will be mandatory.

589
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,318
[SPEAKER_00]: masks will be mandatory.

590
01:04:35,579 --> 01:04:43,883
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask that parents have a supply at home so that the child can wear a clean mask every day.

591
01:04:45,183 --> 01:04:53,547
[SPEAKER_00]: We have put together a resource list of area vendors and online vendors where parents can buy masks at very reasonable prices.

592
01:04:55,148 --> 01:04:59,590
[SPEAKER_00]: If the child soils it or loses it during the day, we will have backup

593
01:05:01,778 --> 01:05:05,040
[SPEAKER_00]: paper masks available for the students to use.

594
01:05:05,561 --> 01:05:22,172
[SPEAKER_00]: We also ask that parents send in a Ziploc bag with their child's name on it so that during a mask break, the child can put their mask into the Ziploc bag and keep it on their desk to just prevent further loss or soiling of it.

595
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:26,970
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, how many mass breaks will students get if in person?

596
01:05:28,431 --> 01:05:32,514
[SPEAKER_00]: We expect at the elementary level that to be about four to six.

597
01:05:32,994 --> 01:05:41,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that happens quite naturally when children eat lunch per se, or when you may take a short recess break.

598
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:47,342
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the upper levels, probably twice a day.

599
01:05:51,553 --> 01:05:53,481
[SPEAKER_07]: And Tony, one more on masks.

600
01:05:57,774 --> 01:06:03,976
[SPEAKER_00]: For parents who cannot supply a mask for their child, we do have backup masks, as I mentioned.

601
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:23,602
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a very invested group of parent volunteers who have been sewing throughout the summer and we will have cloth face masks available in every school in either the nurse's office or in the main office so that students can get them.

602
01:06:24,662 --> 01:06:37,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, if you have special needs that you, you know, you need to speak with one of the nurses, you can either email your building nurse or you can email me and we will address your concerns.

603
01:06:40,126 --> 01:06:40,426
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

604
01:06:40,486 --> 01:06:41,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much, Tony.

605
01:06:41,587 --> 01:06:46,788
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this is a great question for our students who would be choosing the full remote option.

606
01:06:47,168 --> 01:06:53,110
[SPEAKER_07]: So I throw it to our superintendent or assistant superintendent or anyone on the panel who wants to go first.

607
01:06:55,069 --> 01:06:58,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just going to start and then you can go.

608
01:06:58,811 --> 01:07:08,457
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to say that this is definitely something in terms of the remote, from starting from the beginning, we do want to make sure that there is a rapport that is created.

609
01:07:08,797 --> 01:07:19,343
[SPEAKER_10]: We know it's not going to replicate what typically happens each school year, but we are, as Dr. O'Dwyer-Vincent, I think, already mentioned, we are trying to figure out some

610
01:07:20,143 --> 01:07:25,907
[SPEAKER_10]: socially distant, safe outdoor opportunities for students to meet their teachers.

611
01:07:27,148 --> 01:07:29,730
[SPEAKER_10]: That is something that is definitely on our radar.

612
01:07:30,371 --> 01:07:39,377
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also wanted to mention, because this was a question that had scrolled on the side about how teachers will be selected for the remote academy.

613
01:07:39,938 --> 01:07:43,320
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something that we are speaking with the teachers association with.

614
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:45,542
[SPEAKER_10]: So nothing has been determined on that yet.

615
01:07:46,122 --> 01:07:47,744
[SPEAKER_10]: And now I'm gonna throw it to the superintendent.

616
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:53,848
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to echo, we do think it's important to build relationships.

617
01:07:54,169 --> 01:08:09,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And under the social emotional learning umbrella, especially our youngest children, the best developmentally appropriate practices for our early childhood students, most especially, is social interaction and play.

618
01:08:10,381 --> 01:08:14,525
[SPEAKER_03]: And so although it appears like they're playing, tremendous learning is taking place.

619
01:08:15,465 --> 01:08:20,126
[SPEAKER_03]: and they are learning how to work collaboratively and really building great skills.

620
01:08:20,806 --> 01:08:27,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we do want to create those opportunities in as safe a way as possible.

621
01:08:27,788 --> 01:08:35,350
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are thinking a lot about our youngest learners, our kindergartners, our early childhood students.

622
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:42,673
[SPEAKER_03]: who haven't yet had the opportunity to have that strong academic foundation built for them yet.

623
01:08:43,173 --> 01:08:46,035
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is pressing, top of mind for us.

624
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:47,175
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our students are.

625
01:08:47,636 --> 01:08:57,620
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are thinking about, again, our youngest learners who are just learning about school and embarking on their educational journey and their capacity to truly mentally absorb

626
01:08:59,341 --> 01:09:00,361
[SPEAKER_03]: What does this look like?

627
01:09:00,461 --> 01:09:01,202
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening?

628
01:09:01,222 --> 01:09:02,722
[SPEAKER_03]: And why can't they go to school?

629
01:09:03,943 --> 01:09:06,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Or why do they have to keep their mask on all the time?

630
01:09:07,264 --> 01:09:17,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are things that we're thinking about and trying to find ways to make sure that we're always thinking about the whole child and doing what's developmentally appropriate.

631
01:09:18,188 --> 01:09:20,409
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will create those opportunities.

632
01:09:21,409 --> 01:09:26,531
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a lot of work ahead of us, but we're going to continue to work hard on behalf of everyone.

633
01:09:26,671 --> 01:09:27,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

634
01:09:30,205 --> 01:09:30,465
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

635
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:35,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Would anyone else, Paul, Joan, anyone else want to add to any of that?

636
01:09:40,613 --> 01:09:42,094
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

637
01:09:42,614 --> 01:09:43,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Great answers.

638
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

639
01:09:44,576 --> 01:09:48,559
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's see here.

640
01:10:01,511 --> 01:10:06,418
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so Tony, we have another question about masks.

641
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops, lost it there, I apologize.

642
01:10:11,463 --> 01:10:14,126
[SPEAKER_00]: So teachers will be wearing cloth masks.

643
01:10:14,446 --> 01:10:22,493
[SPEAKER_00]: The N95 masks are reserved for health care workers or teachers in special situations.

644
01:10:22,553 --> 01:10:24,275
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really depends upon their role.

645
01:10:25,536 --> 01:10:34,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Some special education teachers, paraprofessionals, direct service providers like speech language therapists, occupational therapists, physical therapists.

646
01:10:35,825 --> 01:10:42,787
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a general education teacher, a cloth mask is sufficient, especially with the six feet of social distancing.

647
01:10:43,947 --> 01:10:50,189
[SPEAKER_00]: To add precautions, we have ordered the plastic face shields for every single teacher.

648
01:10:50,209 --> 01:10:52,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

649
01:10:54,009 --> 01:10:54,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

650
01:10:54,990 --> 01:10:55,890
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate that.

651
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:58,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.

652
01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:59,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see the comments coming in.

653
01:11:01,511 --> 01:11:04,452
[SPEAKER_07]: So what about preschool is a question that I saw.

654
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:09,053
[SPEAKER_07]: just, Joan, would you be able to just preschool.

655
01:11:11,897 --> 01:11:16,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Well I could I could address the special education preschool program.

656
01:11:17,005 --> 01:11:18,907
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the meat program in Medford.

657
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:25,663
[SPEAKER_09]: per Jesse guidance, they are identified as one of our groups that are high needs.

658
01:11:25,743 --> 01:11:34,505
[SPEAKER_09]: So we would be looking into providing as much in-person instruction and routine and structure for those students.

659
01:11:36,005 --> 01:11:47,567
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are working with our special ed coordinator who oversees the MEET program and the rest of the special education coordinators are working together to see what that would look like.

660
01:11:47,748 --> 01:11:50,048
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will have more information coming.

661
01:11:51,019 --> 01:11:54,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

662
01:11:57,543 --> 01:11:58,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, go ahead.

663
01:11:59,384 --> 01:12:09,709
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to take this time to also mention, because I think I've seen some questions, if not scrolling here, but also in emails of people responding to us about afterschool care.

664
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:10,430
[SPEAKER_10]: So

665
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:24,429
[SPEAKER_10]: depending on the plan and how we're returning to school after this Thursday school committee meeting, if we are in person, we will be looking at having afterschool care.

666
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:28,933
[SPEAKER_10]: What that exactly will look like, we could not answer that right now.

667
01:12:29,473 --> 01:12:35,658
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be dependent on the hybrid, so that when your child is in school during their hybrid days,

668
01:12:36,172 --> 01:12:42,818
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking into how we can keep the cohorts together so that we can offer after school to the families that are enrolled.

669
01:12:43,179 --> 01:12:54,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Before school is a little bit more tricky because the cohorts aren't established, but it is on our radar of things that we are looking to provide if we are back to school in person.

670
01:12:58,676 --> 01:13:01,480
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to make sure it got up there and so you can see who asked it.

671
01:13:02,321 --> 01:13:04,064
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think this is a great question here.

672
01:13:04,444 --> 01:13:12,315
[SPEAKER_07]: So given the financial hardships of many of our families, the answer is yes, we would love for parents to come together.

673
01:13:12,335 --> 01:13:13,978
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be working with our PTOs.

674
01:13:14,697 --> 01:13:18,440
[SPEAKER_07]: For any of our PTOs on the call, there are a couple things we're going to be asking for your help for.

675
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Organizing lunch volunteers, organizing volunteers to do walking school buses.

676
01:13:23,883 --> 01:13:28,806
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be partnering with several members of Walk Medford.

677
01:13:29,307 --> 01:13:43,396
[SPEAKER_07]: We've actually already started mapping where students live so that we can start planning our transportation accordingly and really making sure that we're looking out for those students who live in challenging transportation areas.

678
01:13:44,677 --> 01:13:47,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something that's really critical for us.

679
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:55,466
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to be putting out there beseenmasks.com, where you can get Medford branded masks.

680
01:13:56,487 --> 01:14:01,972
[SPEAKER_07]: And we will be making available some of those masks to students who cannot afford them.

681
01:14:02,812 --> 01:14:07,114
[SPEAKER_07]: But if parents want to buy them and then have them available in schools, that'd be great.

682
01:14:07,494 --> 01:14:11,756
[SPEAKER_07]: There are multiple options from camouflage to youth size, to adult size, to gators.

683
01:14:12,637 --> 01:14:16,358
[SPEAKER_07]: You can find them on B-scene masks with many other schools in the area.

684
01:14:16,558 --> 01:14:17,959
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a local puberty company.

685
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:28,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do also want to mention that, so Jen, thank you for asking about how parent input will be solicited after these two meetings this week.

686
01:14:29,905 --> 01:14:39,613
[SPEAKER_07]: So info at medford.k12.ma.us is constantly monitored and is constantly helping us improve our operations.

687
01:14:40,574 --> 01:14:47,820
[SPEAKER_07]: We welcome parents to reach out to us to be a part of the feedback continuously.

688
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:51,421
[SPEAKER_07]: phone calls, however it may be.

689
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:57,562
[SPEAKER_07]: We've offered numerous round tables, thanks to our school committee for helping to organize those and bring those together.

690
01:14:58,602 --> 01:15:06,004
[SPEAKER_07]: We've submitted our plan out to families when some districts have not submitted their plan out.

691
01:15:06,224 --> 01:15:11,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Some districts, their draft is not published yet, despite being submitted to DESE.

692
01:15:12,805 --> 01:15:23,809
[SPEAKER_07]: We tried to go for as detailed a plan as possible, whereas some other districts had very scant plans that were very vague and just described their process.

693
01:15:24,549 --> 01:15:31,412
[SPEAKER_07]: We've tried to include as many people as possible while also making sure that the work groups could still function.

694
01:15:31,532 --> 01:15:35,893
[SPEAKER_07]: There were so many people that wanted to be involved and we wish we could have had more.

695
01:15:37,094 --> 01:15:40,555
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that that's really an important thing to realize.

696
01:15:41,567 --> 01:15:49,883
[SPEAKER_07]: There has been such a great outpouring of support throughout this entire process.

697
01:15:53,789 --> 01:16:01,075
[SPEAKER_07]: to really have that, um, you know, be a, um, to have that continue.

698
01:16:01,615 --> 01:16:05,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so, uh, I'm going to just scroll through the questions.

699
01:16:05,518 --> 01:16:12,804
[SPEAKER_07]: We are coming to the end of our time and, um, you know, we have definitely been working extraordinarily hard.

700
01:16:12,864 --> 01:16:14,165
[SPEAKER_07]: We are doing a lot of research.

701
01:16:14,245 --> 01:16:17,948
[SPEAKER_07]: We are working together with the Medford department of public health.

702
01:16:18,953 --> 01:16:27,400
[SPEAKER_07]: and really making sure that we will be answering all of your questions.

703
01:16:31,824 --> 01:16:34,146
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a question for staff.

704
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:35,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to scroll by.

705
01:16:35,487 --> 01:16:40,711
[SPEAKER_03]: The questions are coming in so quickly that as they're coming through, it's hard.

706
01:16:40,751 --> 01:16:47,497
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the questions that just came through was related to Kids' Corner, which is where we provide

707
01:16:48,497 --> 01:16:53,382
[SPEAKER_03]: child care for the staff of, for the children of the staff here.

708
01:16:53,522 --> 01:17:03,132
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just wanted to say that our intention is to have Kids Corner functioning for Medford public school staff.

709
01:17:03,853 --> 01:17:06,515
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know if there's going to be a

710
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:16,913
[SPEAKER_03]: a reduction in the amount of students that are there, but our intention is to have that available.

711
01:17:17,373 --> 01:17:23,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, that question came in by Lindsay, and so I just was scrolling up.

712
01:17:23,394 --> 01:17:25,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not able to, okay, there we go.

713
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:29,195
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's our intention to have that available.

714
01:17:29,935 --> 01:17:35,917
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, there was the questions that were asked a little earlier about our afterschool programming.

715
01:17:35,957 --> 01:17:36,937
[SPEAKER_03]: We will continue

716
01:17:38,858 --> 01:17:44,684
[SPEAKER_03]: offer that once we have greater guidance on which program we're going to be going with.

717
01:17:45,124 --> 01:17:53,713
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did see a question and I want to pull that question up because Marie?

718
01:17:55,414 --> 01:17:55,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Tony.

719
01:17:57,742 --> 01:18:13,088
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to add something about Kids Corner that Linda Selinger, the director of Kids Corner, and I have met a few times over the summer so that she is aligning the protocols with the protocols that we are using within the building and throughout the district.

720
01:18:13,948 --> 01:18:25,232
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will also be following Department of Ed and Department of Public Health protocols for COVID for both taking care of children and cleaning procedures.

721
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:29,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

722
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:30,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

723
01:18:31,181 --> 01:18:37,927
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I want to show this question that came in from Christie.

724
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:44,692
[SPEAKER_03]: So, she's expressing frustration about using this platform.

725
01:18:45,173 --> 01:18:53,220
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we wanted to give an opportunity to gather questions, feedback, comments, whether it's positive or negative.

726
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:59,942
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to share out this information, so we don't intend on keeping secrets.

727
01:19:00,122 --> 01:19:03,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone can read what's going through on the question board.

728
01:19:04,604 --> 01:19:12,207
[SPEAKER_03]: The board is moving at a very rapid rate, so it's hard trying to scroll back up and find the questions.

729
01:19:13,047 --> 01:19:27,201
[SPEAKER_03]: But in terms of questions that have already come in and questions that have come into many of our inboxes have been about medically, because this COVID situation that we find ourselves in, it's a medical condition.

730
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:30,704
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why we have our director of nursing, Ms.

731
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:35,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Toni Ray, responding to the medical questions, because it is about safety and health.

732
01:19:37,054 --> 01:19:40,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Cleaning has been an issue, an area of concern for many, many districts.

733
01:19:41,435 --> 01:19:43,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Are the buildings going to be clean?

734
01:19:44,276 --> 01:19:46,716
[SPEAKER_03]: We in Medford are very, very prepared.

735
01:19:47,696 --> 01:20:02,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Under the leadership of John McLaughlin, he has ordered the amount of sanitizer and soap and sanitization products that we have, the electrostatic sprayers to keep our buildings clean.

736
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:18,071
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're not able to keep our buildings clean and if we don't have medical counsel during a COVID illness, then you're not going to be able to produce any instruction because the environment isn't safe for students to learn.

737
01:20:18,612 --> 01:20:22,555
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of what's going to be happening academically, that's in our wheelhouse.

738
01:20:23,115 --> 01:20:28,260
[SPEAKER_03]: and so we will be working with the school committee, but this is not about what the curriculum is going to be.

739
01:20:28,881 --> 01:20:39,771
[SPEAKER_03]: We are beholden to the standards of Massachusetts, and so we're going to be using the curriculum that's available to us, and we will be teaching the standards at the appropriate grade levels.

740
01:20:40,172 --> 01:20:46,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we are very, very aware that because school had to shut down for three months,

741
01:20:46,798 --> 01:20:49,101
[SPEAKER_03]: that there is going to be a loss of learning.

742
01:20:49,601 --> 01:21:06,500
[SPEAKER_03]: So if, for example, a child is in second grade or third grade, we know that when we transition to remote learning in the fall, initially the guidance from the commissioner from DESE was to provide enrichment because everyone thought they were going back to school.

743
01:21:08,502 --> 01:21:11,066
[SPEAKER_03]: As everyone can see, that wasn't the outcome.

744
01:21:12,388 --> 01:21:19,457
[SPEAKER_03]: When we left school on March 12th, on Thursday the 12th and Friday the 13th, there was no school.

745
01:21:19,858 --> 01:21:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: We never went back to school again, and no one thought that that was going to happen.

746
01:21:24,384 --> 01:21:40,332
[SPEAKER_03]: So, armed with that information, and armed from the experiences, everything that we heard, the feedback that we received, we are making substantive changes that were evident in the plan, the draft plan that went out on Friday.

747
01:21:40,853 --> 01:21:42,714
[SPEAKER_03]: So, curriculum is going to happen.

748
01:21:42,774 --> 01:21:44,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Teaching and learning is going to happen.

749
01:21:44,635 --> 01:21:46,716
[SPEAKER_03]: We are working collaboratively with the union.

750
01:21:47,896 --> 01:21:54,077
[SPEAKER_03]: We will be figuring out whether in the end it's a remote plan, fully remote, or if it's a hybrid plan.

751
01:21:54,818 --> 01:22:16,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those that are receiving our highest need students that are going to be receiving in-person instruction, because there were a lot of students that were seriously impacted, not just academically, but we do have students that physically regress, that during the school day, they get physical therapy, occupational therapy,

752
01:22:17,122 --> 01:22:19,364
[SPEAKER_03]: They get taken out of their wheelchairs.

753
01:22:19,404 --> 01:22:24,686
[SPEAKER_03]: They get to stand up in a special device that helps them practice their walking.

754
01:22:25,287 --> 01:22:31,030
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of students, you know, I wouldn't be surprised, I'm not a doctor, but muscles may have atrophy.

755
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:35,973
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do have special populations that we have to keep in mind.

756
01:22:36,713 --> 01:22:41,676
[SPEAKER_03]: but from a curriculum content and curriculum perspective, we want it to be engaging.

757
01:22:42,176 --> 01:22:46,359
[SPEAKER_03]: We expect to be meeting the standards and it's going to be grade level appropriate.

758
01:22:46,739 --> 01:23:03,790
[SPEAKER_03]: And at all grade levels, we are fully aware that we're going to be reviewing going back at the beginning of the school year, not just reviewing what would have been taught during the summer, but going back actually to what was the instruction that happened between March and June.

759
01:23:05,336 --> 01:23:10,297
[SPEAKER_03]: building that into our 170 day calendar for our students.

760
01:23:11,338 --> 01:23:14,438
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do not intend on leaving students behind.

761
01:23:14,879 --> 01:23:20,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And the purpose of having this forum is to get additional feedback from the community.

762
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:24,101
[SPEAKER_03]: This entire process has been a collaborative process.

763
01:23:24,481 --> 01:23:27,362
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a process that here at central office

764
01:23:27,902 --> 01:23:33,885
[SPEAKER_03]: myself in isolation with my team, without any feedback, made the plan that was presented to you.

765
01:23:34,305 --> 01:23:47,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I can proudly say to you that we had teachers at the table, we had school committee members at the table, we had parents at the table, we had different stakeholder groups representing the diversity of the district at the table.

766
01:23:47,872 --> 01:23:54,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the product that was presented as a draft on last Friday was the collective product of many minds,

767
01:23:55,636 --> 01:23:58,777
[SPEAKER_03]: pouring their heart and soul into the document that you received.

768
01:23:59,258 --> 01:24:06,961
[SPEAKER_03]: And this opportunity this evening is to get additional feedback to better and further inform what it is that we're doing.

769
01:24:07,441 --> 01:24:15,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow morning, we will also be doing this again for parents who aren't able to be on at 10 o'clock in the morning to give your feedback.

770
01:24:16,345 --> 01:24:19,186
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether it's good feedback, it's cool feedback,

771
01:24:19,827 --> 01:24:24,972
[SPEAKER_03]: or it's feedback where you feel something else should be done, we want to take it into consideration.

772
01:24:25,513 --> 01:24:34,242
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to be able to give the answer that everyone wants for every single question, but we want to at least try our best.

773
01:24:35,003 --> 01:24:41,826
[SPEAKER_03]: to respond to all questions and also let the community know that we want what's best for all children in Medford.

774
01:24:42,386 --> 01:24:49,329
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to stress that we are working very hard and we are working collaboratively with all stakeholders.

775
01:24:49,769 --> 01:24:55,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I intend for us to continue doing to open the school year and to start strong.

776
01:24:55,792 --> 01:24:57,612
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't want to leave any kids behind.

777
01:24:58,373 --> 01:25:02,715
[SPEAKER_03]: We want everyone in Medford to have a quality education experience.

778
01:25:03,195 --> 01:25:03,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

779
01:25:05,342 --> 01:25:08,084
[SPEAKER_07]: So ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank our panelists for being here tonight.

780
01:25:09,044 --> 01:25:11,086
[SPEAKER_07]: We are coming up to the end of our time this evening.

781
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:15,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say thank you to every single person who's been a part of this.

782
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:27,977
[SPEAKER_07]: And we look forward to not only hearing your feedback through email, but also we'll definitely set up more forums in the future as this year goes on.

783
01:25:28,516 --> 01:25:31,340
[SPEAKER_07]: so that we can establish clear communication.

784
01:25:32,081 --> 01:25:33,984
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you very much.

785
01:25:34,324 --> 01:25:36,828
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's make it a great day to be a Mustang.

786
01:25:37,328 --> 01:25:37,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

787
01:25:37,749 --> 01:25:38,470
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll see.
