    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=3.488s">All</a>  right, good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=5.889s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=6.529s">Thank</a>  you very much for joining us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=9.731s">We</a>  are here at Medford Central Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=13.033s">My</a>  name is Peter Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=14.274s">I</a>  am the assistant superintendent of schools here with.</p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=18.616s">Suzanne</a>  Galussi, also the assistant superintendent of elementary education.</p>

    <p>[_gfHlARF6Jg_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=22.638s">And.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=25.14s">Maurice</a>  Edvard-Vincent, superintendent of schools.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=29.032s">And</a>  so this platform, I noticed somebody posted in the chat, is this like Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=35.658s">So</a>  this is not like Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=38.261s">This</a>  is kind of a television broadcast studio presentation that allows us to bring in numerous people. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=46.188s">We</a>  anticipated a very high volume. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=50.111s">of</a>  participants, and so the Zoom functionality has a limit to it, and we wanted to make sure that we could have as many people as possible in, and the way you will communicate with us is you will submit a comment to the chat function or the comment box on the <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=74.389s">YouTube</a>  channel or our Facebook page. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=77.991s">This</a>  presentation will be recorded and it will be available for people to watch, hear the answers, we'll be responding to your questions, and if we don't have answers, we're going to have to get back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=92.241s">This</a>  is an ever-changing situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=95.522s">And</a>  I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Edouard-Vincent to give a little bit more information about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=101.204s">And</a>  then we'll welcome some of our panelists into the studio who have really helped with our development of this plan thus far.</p>

    <p>[_gfHlARF6Jg_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=109.639s">So</a>  I want to say hello and thank you everyone for joining us today to share your ideas, your thoughts, your perspectives, your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=119.082s">Also,</a>  I want to name specifically how challenging this current situation is for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=125.343s">And</a>  given the challenging and complicated circumstances, there would be honestly, there's no ideal plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=135.856s">But</a>  working together, the way we've come together for Medford, this is the best plan that we were able to come up with thus far. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=144.201s">So</a>  this is an opportunity, again, for you to be able to share your ideas, your thoughts, feedback with us so that we can continue to further enhance and improve what it is that we're trying to do for all of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=158.77s">I</a>  want to give you just a brief overview of the process that we've taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=163.214s">This</a>  was truly a collaborative process that involved many, many different stakeholders. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=168.918s">We</a>  utilized three core values. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=171.5s">Our</a>  three guiding pillars were equity, consistency, and safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=176.825s">And</a>  those three guiding pillars that were used, they helped us to guide our planning of the workgroups, <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=185.485s">and</a>  how we operated to get to the final end product that you received over the weekend on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=192.271s">So</a>  we had work groups and those work groups focused on three areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=196.154s">It</a>  was operations, it was instruction, and it was also communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=201.897s">We</a>  held some listening sessions last week and got additional thoughts and perspectives of others who weren't able to join the subgroups, the working groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=214.0s">But</a>  because they had volunteered and they were willing to be part of the team, we were so appreciative of that contribution from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=224.583s">So</a>  we did hold some listening sessions last week and we're holding one this evening and again tomorrow as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=231.306s">And</a>  then again, gathering all of that feedback from what we had last week, we released the plan on Friday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=239.713s">So</a>  what is our timeline moving forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=242.056s">We</a>  want to continue to hear community feedback and we're going to integrate that feedback into our final plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=252.362s">which</a>  we'll be presenting to school committee on Thursday evening, this Thursday, August 6th at 6 p.m., we have a school committee meeting and it'll be formally posted tomorrow, but that'll be an opportunity for us to talk again and discuss and for the school committee to weigh in and provide their guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=276.068s">The</a>  official plan will be submitted to DESI on Monday, August 10th. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=281.134s">So</a>  we're on a very, very tight timeline, but we're going to do everything that we can to make that tight timeline and be in compliance with DESI. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=291.224s">So</a>  I just want to give you the goals for tonight's session. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=295.026s">We</a>  want to be able to hear your thoughts, your ideas, your concerns as we finalize the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=301.11s">And</a>  we're going to do our best to address those thoughts, your concerns, your ideas, questions that we can answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=308.834s">There</a>  is a panel of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=311.635s">We</a>  will jump in and we will answer those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=314.937s">And</a>  again, as Dr. Cushing said earlier, if we cannot answer the questions, <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=320.1s">then</a>  we will get it added to our FAQ. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=323.621s">So,</a>  you know, and again, due to the time constraints, we're not going to be able to probably answer every single question, because I can see the questions are coming in, you know, at a very good clip right now, which is wonderful, because all of your questions are going to be saved, and we will be able to address those questions in our FAQ. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=343.786s">So,</a>  again, tonight, for your participation, please add your questions in the chat functions, either on Facebook or YouTube, and myself or any of the other panelists, we are going to try to start answering as many questions as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=360.3s">Dr.</a>  Cushing will be moderating today's session. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=363.723s">Thank</a>  you so much, and I look forward to this conversation.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=367.452s">My</a>  apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=368.512s">So,</a>  um, some of you have mentioned about masks and close quarters. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=372.533s">Uh,</a>  we were only taking our masks off for very brief, um, moments of time to speak as you can, um, obviously see, I'm going to bring some people into the studio, um, so they can introduce themselves and just to give a little quick background. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=386.696s">And</a>  then we're going to start with some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=388.176s">So</a>  I'm going to bring in, uh, Stacy Shulman, uh, John McLaughlin, Joan Bowen, <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=397.28s">and</a>  Paul Texera, just to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=401.642s">And</a>  then, so if you guys can introduce yourselves and just speak to a little bit of the process thus far.</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=415.742s">Hi,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=416.422s">I'm</a>  Stacey Shulman. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=417.323s">I'm</a>  the Director of School Counseling and Behavioral Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=420.624s">And</a>  in part of the reopening plan, I was a member of both the steering committee as well as the instructional SEL groups.</p>

    <p>[_gfHlARF6Jg_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=429.307s">Hi,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=429.927s">I'm</a>  Joan Bowen. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=430.668s">I'm</a>  the Director of Pupil Services. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=432.888s">I</a>  was also on the steering committee and I was also involved in developing the hybrid model.</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=442.112s">I'm</a>  Paul Texer. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=443.032s">I'm</a>  the Director of English Learners for the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=445.672s">and</a>  I was on the hybrid model as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=453.534s">Good</a>  evening, I'm John McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[U1EIl_L-LWc_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=455.815s">I'm</a>  director of buildings for the city for 30 years.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=461.676s">All</a>  right, so I'm going to start going through questions and putting them up on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=469.938s">You</a>  can <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=472.472s">Also,</a>  let me just bring in two more people actually real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=477.414s">Tom,</a>  I'm going to go with you first and then Mr. Johnson.</p>

    <p>[_gfHlARF6Jg_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=482.777s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=483.638s">I'm</a>  Tom Millicheski and I'm a superintendent resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=486.699s">I</a>  worked on the communication and stakeholder engagement workgroup and also worked on the steering committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=493.042s">Looking</a>  forward to diving into this all with you tonight.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=497.764s">And</a>  Mr. Johnson.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=500.519s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=500.939s">I'm</a>  Kirk Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=501.88s">I</a>  was the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=503.241s">I</a>  worked on the operations subcommittee with Dr. Cushing, and also I was on the steering committee with Dr. Robinson and her team.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=510.066s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=512.188s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=512.909s">So</a>  we're going to start with a question from Debbie, and you'll be able to see it come up on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=518.873s">Once</a>  we make our selection for our kids, is the decision final, or can we change our minds as things develop through late August and September? <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=526.699s">And</a>  I'm going to turn that over to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=528.5s">Galussi.</a> </p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=530.009s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=531.07s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Cushing. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=534.192s">That's</a>  one of the things that we are working to finalize right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=538.194s">Part</a>  of the discussion would be that we are thinking of breaking up the decision into semesters. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=545.759s">Similarly,</a>  not maybe exactly like the grading goes, but maybe just one or two semesters. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=551.983s">We</a>  understand that <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=555.031s">things,</a>  this whole, as Dr. Cushing mentioned, this whole situation is fluid. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=559.852s">And</a>  so we know that family decisions are also going to be fluid and that some plans may not work for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=567.074s">So</a>  we're going to be collecting data every four to six weeks for various things. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=573.036s">But</a>  one of the points that we're going to target is how the plans are working for students and for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=579.758s">So</a>  a final decision and more information for that will be made available soon.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=586.667s">All</a>  right, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=588.227s">And</a>  let me get some more of the questions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=591.288s">Thank</a>  you very much for sending them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=594.749s">And</a>  so we're going to go with this one here right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=598.61s">Will</a>  electronic devices be given to each student regardless of education options, seeing as even the in-school option has built-in remote learning day? <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=607.772s">So</a>  right now we are planning to go one-to-one as a district. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=612.493s">We</a>  are facing some supply chain challenges <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=616.495s">We</a>  ordered them in June prior to the July 1 fiscal year, but we were able to get the order in ahead of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=624.278s">However,</a>  the supply chain comes through China, the epicenter of where this all started, and we have had some challenges, and there are also some customs issues with the commerce department. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=641.383s">So</a>  just want to make sure that we are going to be working on that and that we do intend to get that to all of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=652.269s">We</a>  will prioritize student need as devices come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=658.332s">So</a>  if we are not having devices, we will prioritize student need. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=663.014s">I</a>  also want to invite a new person just to introduce themselves, Toni Wray. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=668.345s">Sorry,</a>  Toni Wray, you're now on the stream.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=674.974s">Hello,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=677.138s">It's</a>  good to see everybody here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=678.72s">Thank</a>  you for joining us.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=683.517s">So</a>  in the feedback on info at, we've gotten a lot of feedback about outdoor classrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=692.648s">Yes,</a>  outdoor classrooms are and outdoor learning spaces are being seriously considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=697.493s">We're</a>  currently looking into tents for some of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=701.858s">Some</a>  of our schools have a challenge of a small footprint. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=704.961s">Um,</a>  so there's a serious limitation as to how many tents we can fit on a site. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=711.671s">Um,</a>  certain classes, band music and others are being recommended to be held outdoors. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=718.343s">Um,</a>  so we are currently exploring that there is a cost, um, for the tents. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=723.268s">They're</a>  not cheap. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=724.91s">Um,</a>  but we are currently finalizing how many we would like to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=728.393s">Um,</a>  and we are definitely trying to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=734.059s">Um,</a>  I'm just gonna take a second here to scroll through the comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=738.062s">Um,</a>  real quick here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=740.365s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=748.851s">Here</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=750.053s">If</a>  we have two kids in different schools, will it be coordinated that they both go on the same model? <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=755.82s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=755.98s">Galussi?</a> </p>

    <p>[Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=759.324s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=760.406s">That</a>  is something that we are also in the process of coordinating between all the schools and our data management <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=769.4s">person,</a>  Kim Miles, so we are going to ensure that families, we're giving families choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=776.706s">That</a>  is going to be part of the survey we send out, and if you would like your children to be part of the same cohort, or if you actually would like your children to be part of different cohorts, that may be more manageable for you in your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=788.375s">So</a>  we're going to handle it through the survey, and that will be one of the questions that you can give us the feedback for, and then we'll have more information in creating the cohorts for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=798.561s">hope</a>  that answered your question.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=799.741s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=803.503s">Let</a>  me scroll through some of the questions here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=819.983s">Toni</a>  Wray, do you want to speak for a moment on PPE and nursing and all that good stuff that I'm sure everybody is questioning right now as well?</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=830.854s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=831.675s">Yes,</a>  Peter, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=833.856s">So</a>  we very early started ordering PPE as recommended by the Department of Ed. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=840.56s">To</a>  date, we have bought 15,000 adult masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=846.904s">We've</a>  bought over 6,000 child-sized masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=852.627s">Those</a>  are for children who either soil or forget a mask during this <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=858.27s">during</a>  the school day and we'll be able to replace that for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=863.272s">We</a>  have bought face shields so that every educator will have a face shield. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=869.274s">We</a>  bought some acrylic desk shields that we will give to the K-1 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=877.137s">And</a>  let's see, what else? <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=878.458s">We</a>  have bought lots of cleaning supplies, including wipes, cleaning solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=884.681s">John</a>  McLaughlin, the director of buildings and grounds has bought electrostatic sprayers so that rooms can be cleaned every single day and sometimes in between the days, in between the school day, depending on whatever's going on in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=903.131s">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=905.289s">I</a>  mean, I think we're in pretty good shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=907.411s">We</a>  have a couple of PPE articles that have been backordered. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=912.435s">We</a>  expect them to be in by the time school starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=915.797s">The</a>  nurses have been preparing training modules for our staff and students. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=920.781s">They've</a>  been working on the different protocols, customizing them from DESE to the Medford campus.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=931.829s">Thank</a>  you very much, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=932.97s">Ray.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=935.526s">Let</a>  me just pull up a question here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=947.936s">So</a>  let's, Maria, so how we're going to communicate is right now we are, sorry, that's the wrong question. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=954.601s">They're</a>  coming in fast and furious. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=958.885s">So</a>  the question was how are we going to communicate answers to questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=962.468s">And</a>  so the way we're going to communicate answers to question is we're going to take all the information that's coming in and we're going to compile a frequently asked questions document. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=973.838s">Um,</a>  all the questions will be available to everybody to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=976.921s">And,</a>  um, we're going to strip away people's private information, emails, names, all that type of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=984.227s">But</a>  we want to be 100% transparent, given the amount of questions that we're receiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=990.191s">And</a>  just, you know, given the uncertainty of everything, we want to make sure that we are really well aware of everything that's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1001.118s">So,</a>  Joan, would you like to speak to special education quickly?</p>

    <p>[_gfHlARF6Jg_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1011.109s">Sure,</a>  so we've been working closely with all the team members of the subcommittees to look at our special education population and make sure that we're meeting their needs, both in the remote plan, the hybrid plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1025.804s">And</a>  we're also following DESE's guidelines regarding identifying our highest needs students to provide some in-person <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1035.616s">instruction</a>  and related services. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1038.497s">So</a>  we continue to work on that with the special education team and we will have more information as we complete that and identify what that specific model will look like for our special education students.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1068.348s">So</a>  Tony, just curious, how many guest shields have we ordered?</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1071.17s">Give</a>  me a second, I'll pull up that inventory list because we've ordered so many different things, it's blurred in my mind.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1080.819s">Yep,</a>  we have quite the assortment of PPE coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1085.262s">So</a>  those desk shields are going to be for grades K and 1 primarily, and for students who really need them because of the inability to wear a mask because of a documented medical issue or disability. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1099.871s">So</a>  once again, documented medical issue or disability. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1103.794s">Wearing</a>  masks is fundamentally critical, <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1106.876s">And</a>  we are currently now reconsidering a portion of the draft that spoke about kindergarten and first graders not wearing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1113.84s">We've</a>  received a lot of feedback from families really asking that K and one wear those masks. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1121.584s">So</a>  that is something that we're going to consider, Tony.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1124.895s">I</a>  was just going to add, Peter, that the important thing for the K1 and 2 students, they're the students we bought the desk shields for, is that those students are learning phonics. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1136.32s">And</a>  it's very important that children's faces can be seen by the teacher, and the teacher will have an acrylic face shield so the children can see their face as they speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1149.665s">we</a>  thought that was important educationally and developmentally to meet those students' needs.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1166.658s">Stacey,</a>  would you like to address SEL?</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1173.769s">Sure,</a>  I think just overall that everyone in any of these reopening task force groups understands that this is an incredibly emotional time. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1186.821s">It's</a>  riddled with anxiety. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1189.764s">Students</a>  have been through a lot, families have been through a lot, and we are taking all of that into consideration in terms of what is best <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1199.911s">in</a>  order to support families in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1202.412s">One</a>  of the major areas we're planning on focusing on is especially with routines and executive functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1210.218s">So</a>  executive functioning is how to organize your work, how to follow a schedule, how to create routines for yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1218.186s">how</a>  to manage all of those organizational tasks. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1221.228s">And</a>  in any of the reopening plans, we have added additional time in both for students, for staff, as well as for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1230.254s">So</a>  everyone is able to have an opportunity to be on the same page and to get additional instruction in those areas specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1238.439s">We'll</a>  also be adding a lot more counseling opportunities for students, not only small individual <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1248.548s">lessons</a>  in the classrooms for SEL with more morning meetings and advisories at the secondary level, but we're also will be adding more group counseling for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1258.731s">And</a>  those group counseling lessons will be based in cognitive behavioral therapy, focusing mainly on depression, anxiety, as well as trauma.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1271.795s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1273.155s">Let</a>  me pull up the next question here. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1274.895s">It's</a>  about the upcoming survey <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1277.843s">So</a>  I'm going to throw it to Dr. Edouard-Vincent.</p>

    <p>[_gfHlARF6Jg_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1283.428s">So</a>  yes, what information will be asked in a survey? <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1286.331s">We're</a>  going to be surveying you once we will be sending out the survey, once we get our plan approved, and we're going to be seeking information about what plan you intend on <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1302.375s">as</a>  a parent, what you would be liking for your particular family, for your child or for your children. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1307.918s">Are</a>  there some, not to have it official, but if there were to be a potential concern medically, things that we might need to take into consideration, technology needs, such as do you have a device? <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1327.928s">Do</a>  you have connectivity? <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1331.696s">and</a>  the ability to possibly print. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1334.601s">So</a>  we're just trying to figure that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1337.826s">We're</a>  also looking into transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1341.772s">What</a>  were your plans for transportation about next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1345.405s">So</a>  we are finalizing that survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1349.207s">And</a>  Georgiana was asking whether it would be done on SurveyMonkey as opposed to Google Forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1355.95s">So</a>  thank you for putting that suggestion forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1360.272s">That</a>  was the first time that someone asked about SurveyMonkey. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1363.734s">But</a>  we definitely want it in a format that we'll be able to get names and be able to get an idea of <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1375.32s">the</a>  interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1376.28s">So</a>  once that comes forward, when we send out the survey, it will be emailed, you'll get a robocall. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1385.164s">Please,</a>  please, please, I'm going to ask everyone to fill out that survey because we need that information to further and better inform our next steps so that we'll be able to have a strong opening of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1397.51s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1400.606s">All</a>  right, we want to also give a chance for Mr. Teixeira to speak as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1405.392s">We</a>  are having some connectivity issues for some of our people. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1407.955s">Mr.</a>  Johnson and Mr. McLaughlin, they've been in and out, so we'll have them in momentarily to speak, but wanted to throw it to Mr. Teixeira.</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1419.907s">So</a>  we're designing the EL program to mirror what the mainstream students are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1425.794s">DESE</a>  has not supplied us with specific guidance in relation to English learners, except for those English learners who are also duly identified as having an IEP. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1437.246s">So</a>  once that guidance comes through, if we need to shift what the plan is for all students to accommodate DESE's requirements for ELs, then we'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1448.137s">But</a>  for right now, we're sticking to the plan the way it's been written, and all EL families will have the same options as all the other students to choose remote, you know, or on what the model is that we go.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1468.789s">I</a>  can also speak a little bit to the hybrid model while we're waiting.</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1491.095s">We</a>  put together a hybrid model that would follow the same schedule for elementary, middle, and high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1498.277s">We</a>  have two days of in-person instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1501.577s">Students</a>  will be divided into a cohort, either Cohort 1 or Cohort 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1507.438s">Cohort</a>  1 will meet on Mondays and Tuesdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1510.079s">Cohort</a>  2 will meet on Thursdays and Fridays for live in-person. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1515.489s">On</a>  Wednesday, that's when the teachers will do live remote learning to bring the two cohorts together as a full class, because the goal is that we will be returning to school and students will have the opportunity to know who is in their class. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1531.159s">On</a>  the days that students are working from home, they will be doing asynchronous learning and dependent learning from their teachers, but it will be the same curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1541.649s">It</a>  won't be a separate enrichment. <a href="https://youtu.be/wrDSsgezdHw&t=1544.491s">It</a>  will be following the curriculum that has been laid out by grade level and subject matter.</p>
