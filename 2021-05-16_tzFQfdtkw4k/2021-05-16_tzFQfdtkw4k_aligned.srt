1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:04,074
The next candidate is Isaac B. Zach Beers.

2
00:00:09,098 --> 00:00:11,320
Thanks for using the long version of my name, Henry.

3
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:25,230
So first I want to thank Henry and Julia, the Medford Democratic City Committee, the Ward 6 Committee, and of course everyone who's here tonight, the audience and the 13 other candidates from Medford City Council.

4
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:27,072
My name is Zach Bares.

5
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:31,435
I'm running to represent the people of Medford as a candidate for city council.

6
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:35,718
I'm a lifelong resident of the Fulton Heights, where I live with my parents, Laura and Bruce.

7
00:00:36,198 --> 00:00:43,103
And a lot like Nat, I'd like to stay in the city, and I'm at home right now because I have a college degree, a full-time job, and Medford's not affordable for working people.

8
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:49,388
I graduated from Medford High School in 2011 after attending the Davenport, Hervey, Brooks, and Andrews schools.

9
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:51,709
I attended UMass Amherst, graduating in 2015.

10
00:00:53,362 --> 00:01:03,484
Currently, I'm the executive director of Phenom, a nonprofit that advocates for public education and fights alongside parents, teachers, and students to make sure that public schools and colleges are fully funded.

11
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:19,648
I'm happy to say that just yesterday, after spending hours at the Statehouse, not as many as Paul Donato, who was just in the room, though, the House of Representatives just passed the Student Opportunity Act, which is going to invest millions of dollars in Medford schools and billions of dollars in public schools across the state.

12
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:27,261
I know what this community means to so many residents, whether they've lived here for five years or 50 years, because it means so much to me.

13
00:01:28,082 --> 00:01:32,866
Medford has always been a city for everyone, where people of different backgrounds and traditions live together.

14
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:37,289
But with all the luxury condos and the high-end development, that's starting to change.

15
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,513
I believe in a Medford that works for all, not just for rich property developers.

16
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:48,138
This year, we have an opportunity to elect city councilors who are ready to fight for more investment in our infrastructure and our city services,

17
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:57,565
who are gonna reach out to residents and really include them in big decisions and make sure that Medford remains and becomes, in some cases, livable for working families.

18
00:01:58,526 --> 00:02:04,850
It's gonna take real work, planning, and commitment to welcome new residents while making sure that people wanna stay here aren't pushed out.

19
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:12,175
That's why the most important thing we need to do is create a five-year master plan for housing, traffic, and new property development.

20
00:02:12,815 --> 00:02:14,116
That includes a zoning review.

21
00:02:14,576 --> 00:02:18,519
Right now, we're working with developers on a case-by-case or a project-by-project basis

22
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:21,198
And that gives them a huge advantage in negotiations.

23
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:35,699
If we want more commercial development, responsible residential development, community benefits agreements that provide millions of dollars in fees to help fund the important things that our city needs, and just affordable homes for working families and people who want to stay here, we need a plan.

24
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:41,042
A big piece of this is improving the walkability and the livability of our squares.

25
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:50,409
Right now, you look at Medford Square, three of the five or six ways to get in here, nobody wants to walk to the square, because they're afraid they're going to get injured, hit by a car, stuck at a light.

26
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:59,796
We really need to take a look at making our public squares more walkable, because that's how we get people there, that's how we get commercial development there, and that's how we make them places that people want to go.

27
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:05,520
At the end of the day, we have something the developers want, and we have the power to make them play by our rules.

28
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:09,476
We also need to invest in our city infrastructure and services.

29
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:14,501
Medford residents deserve roads, sidewalks, parks, and public buildings that aren't falling apart.

30
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:22,989
As a graduate of Medford Public Schools and through my day job that I mentioned, I'm also committed to our public schools and working with the school committee to support them.

31
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:29,796
We need to create a city council subcommittee on education so we can build a stronger partnership between the council and the school committee.

32
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:36,654
The city and our elected officials also need to do a better job of communicating and engaging residents in big decisions that affect them.

33
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:45,037
That's why I'll hold regular public office hours and invite residents to review city council meeting agendas and materials before the meeting so we can decide what we want to do.

34
00:03:46,097 --> 00:03:48,438
It's also why we need new city and school websites.

35
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,319
Has anyone been on any of our websites recently?

36
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:53,300
So residents and families can find the information they need.

37
00:03:54,221 --> 00:04:01,532
I also strongly support charter review and ward representation so that we can get more views and allow more people to serve on this council.

38
00:04:01,652 --> 00:04:05,158
We can't afford to have a council that doesn't represent everyone in our city.

39
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:13,038
Finally, as your city councilor, I'll work with the mayor's office, the other councilors, and the school committee to make sure that your voice is heard.

40
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:19,121
We can only make these big decisions together by including as many residents as possible in the process.

41
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,283
That's how we build a Medford where working people can raise a family.

42
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:23,904
My name is Zach Baers.

43
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,205
You can read more about me at zachbaers.com.

44
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,547
That's Z-A-C-B-E-A-R-S, like the animal.

45
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,030
And I'm number six on the November ballot, and I would be honored to receive one of your seven votes for city council on November 5th.

46
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,510
Thank you.

47
00:04:38,496 --> 00:04:39,809
Thank you, Candidate Zach.
