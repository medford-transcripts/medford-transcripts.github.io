174
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:47,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we'll take them together, 1516-055, offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Medford City Council

175
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:55,555
[SPEAKER_05]: commend and congratulate the Medford Arts Council for being selected as the 2016 Council of the Year by the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

176
00:03:56,835 --> 00:03:57,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

177
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:03,678
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Felkel for also offering his resolution of the same subject.

178
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:16,064
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Medford's on the move, Mr. President, and we have many great volunteers to thank, and we're getting a lot of good press in this community when it comes to the arts.

179
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:34,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Of most recent, Mr. President, as you just mentioned, the Massachusetts Cultural Council announced a few days ago that the Method Arts Council is the recipient of the 2016 Council of the Year Award for its dedication to community arts and culture over the past year.

180
00:04:34,453 --> 00:04:42,560
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, this is a recognition, Mr. President, that is comprised of 329 local cultural councils.

181
00:04:45,272 --> 00:04:47,193
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not one of five, one of 10.

182
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:51,975
[SPEAKER_10]: This is 329 statewide cultural councils.

183
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:57,778
[SPEAKER_10]: And our great council volunteers received the number one recognition, Mr. President.

184
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:12,604
[SPEAKER_10]: And here we have a group, Mr. President, until just recently, the last two to three years, had zero funding from the city.

185
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:13,985
[SPEAKER_10]: There was no direct

186
00:05:14,428 --> 00:05:41,680
[SPEAKER_10]: funding mechanism to support the arts in this community from the administration until, I believe it was three years now, two to three years, that there was a resolution offered by this council requesting that the administration look into creating a line item for the arts in our community, which funds thousands of projects a year in the community, involves people from three years old to 83 years old of the community,

187
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:45,482
[SPEAKER_10]: And it really touches every aspect of our community.

188
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:53,723
[SPEAKER_10]: And without the Method Arts Council and these dedicated people to organize, a lot of this would never happen, Mr. President.

189
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:58,584
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just personally would like to thank all the members of the Method Arts Council.

190
00:05:59,065 --> 00:06:05,786
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to also recognize them here tonight through a citation, Mr. President, a future citation.

191
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:07,966
[SPEAKER_10]: I know many members are here tonight.

192
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:10,867
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd just like to recognize, Mr. President,

193
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:15,103
[SPEAKER_10]: The chair of the Medford Arts Council, Gary Roberts, is here with us tonight.

194
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:22,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Laurel Siegel is the treasurer of the Medford Arts Council.

195
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:28,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Anita Tucker is the secretary of the Medford Arts Council.

196
00:06:31,994 --> 00:06:35,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Bettina Lentzfeld is the grant coordinator of the Medford Arts Council.

197
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Patricia Davis is a member.

198
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Jenny Gilbert.

199
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:45,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Jenny Gilbert.

200
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:46,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Linda Malik.

201
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,001
[SPEAKER_10]: And Allie Fisk is also a member of the Method Arts Council.

202
00:06:58,203 --> 00:07:11,810
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I had the opportunity, I think it was probably eight months ago or maybe a little longer, to sit down with the chair of the Arts Council, Mr. President, Mr. Roberts.

203
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:33,410
[SPEAKER_10]: And he presented to me a portfolio of accomplishments over the years, also a projection of what they'd like to see done over the next several years regarding how we can improve arts in the community and involve more community outreach to different aspects and segments of the community.

204
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,612
[SPEAKER_10]: And I found it quite enlightening

205
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:44,320
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things that, and I bring it up quite often, I brought it up during the debates, when we had our council debates.

206
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:48,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Gary mentioned to me about things that are done in other communities.

207
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:53,647
[SPEAKER_10]: And he pointed out, he had a PowerPoint presentation, he was well prepared, which was great.

208
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,730
[SPEAKER_10]: And he pointed out what they do in Lowell, Mr. President.

209
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:06,037
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't like to compare ourselves to other surrounding communities, but I think it's important to look when the success in other communities

210
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:12,104
[SPEAKER_10]: and try to capture that success in a way that represents our city, in a way that works for our city.

211
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:24,917
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was one particular thing that stood out to me, and it was the performing arts, and how they utilized pox and lull that were downtrodden and crime-ridden and filled with drugs.

212
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:31,866
[SPEAKER_10]: And they opened them up to the arts community, built small performance stages at very minimal cost.

213
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:38,488
[SPEAKER_10]: They encompassed their park with wrought iron art and signage.

214
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:42,310
[SPEAKER_10]: And they made it so welcoming that people wanted all of a sudden to say, you know what?

215
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,130
[SPEAKER_10]: This is no longer a drug park.

216
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,591
[SPEAKER_10]: This is no longer a park I'm afraid to take my kids.

217
00:08:46,992 --> 00:08:48,132
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a welcoming park.

218
00:08:48,672 --> 00:08:52,834
[SPEAKER_10]: And the performance stage, you know, it was very modest.

219
00:08:53,355 --> 00:09:04,200
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was enough to attract people back, make these community parks, which we are very fortunate in our community to have so many community parks, as once again part of the community.

220
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:15,885
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would submit to my fellow colleagues that, you know, years ago we used to have the park leagues, and there used to be a lot of activity in the parks, as Councilor Scarpelli could probably attest to.

221
00:09:16,358 --> 00:09:23,163
[SPEAKER_10]: And over the years, our parks have really grown to just a large open space that's, in my opinion, underutilized.

222
00:09:23,944 --> 00:09:37,294
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we have a real gem here with, at least with the Method Arts Council and their vision to utilize this open space, attract people in the neighborhoods so you can meet the people.

223
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:41,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Nowadays, you only know the people that live across the street or next door to you.

224
00:09:42,217 --> 00:09:45,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't it be nice to go to a local park that's right down the street,

225
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:47,209
[SPEAKER_10]: and meet neighbors in your neighborhood.

226
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:49,711
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a great concept.

227
00:09:50,351 --> 00:10:01,438
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know these are the small things that the Method Arts Council is working on towards under the leadership of Mr. Roberts and the whole group that's been active for years.

228
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:13,426
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to personally thank them, Mr. President, for putting Method once again on the map and letting people know that this community is an art community.

229
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,947
[SPEAKER_10]: We are a cultural community.

230
00:10:15,367 --> 00:10:20,129
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a lot of assets in this community, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.

231
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:34,555
[SPEAKER_10]: I see a bright, bright future based on the volunteers that we have here tonight and the other hundreds of volunteers throughout the community that are part of the Method Arts Council and all the different groups that are comprised of MACI and so forth.

232
00:10:34,575 --> 00:10:42,758
[SPEAKER_10]: So, again, Mr. President, I'd like to thank the members of the Method Arts Council and that they be duly recognized.

233
00:10:43,418 --> 00:10:45,680
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, by an official citation of the Medford city council.

234
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:51,385
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Marks that they be recognized by citation.

235
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:59,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, the chair, uh, recognizes councilor Falco who also, uh, presented to us a motion of a similar nature.

236
00:10:59,591 --> 00:11:00,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

237
00:11:00,312 --> 00:11:01,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

238
00:11:01,292 --> 00:11:02,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, uh, councilor Marks.

239
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:08,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I, again, uh, thank you for you bringing the citation forward and, uh, for, uh,

240
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:10,389
[SPEAKER_09]: recognizing the Medford Arts Council.

241
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations to the Medford Arts Council.

242
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Fabulous job.

243
00:11:14,451 --> 00:11:15,412
[SPEAKER_09]: This is pretty amazing.

244
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:20,815
[SPEAKER_09]: When you think about it, you are only the third council to ever receive this award, which is pretty amazing.

245
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,237
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just a great group of people.

246
00:11:24,677 --> 00:11:33,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Myself and I believe Councilor Marks and Councilor Caraviello last fall had the opportunity to attend the Arts and Culture Summit that you had in this very room.

247
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:35,363
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just a great day.

248
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:44,623
[SPEAKER_09]: to see that many, I think there must have been about 100 people, over 30, 35 organizations that were here talking about arts and culture and the importance of arts and culture in our community.

249
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:48,485
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just, this is a great achievement.

250
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:54,168
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there's a lot of great things, you know, that you're working on and there's a bright future.

251
00:11:54,208 --> 00:12:00,071
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, you know, also the really important thing is that, you know, that we make sure that this is funded in the budget.

252
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:01,092
[SPEAKER_09]: It's important.

253
00:12:01,192 --> 00:12:02,452
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to stand by you.

254
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:05,694
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know I will and I'm sure my colleagues will as well.

255
00:12:06,256 --> 00:12:07,296
[SPEAKER_09]: in the administration as well.

256
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:09,317
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just want to say congratulations.

257
00:12:09,357 --> 00:12:09,857
[SPEAKER_09]: Great job.

258
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:10,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up the great work.

259
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:10,777
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

260
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:11,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

261
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:17,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, on the motion of approval.

262
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:19,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, please, by all means.

263
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:22,619
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm glad Councilor Falco brought up the funding.

264
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,521
[SPEAKER_10]: And I received several emails from members of local artists in the community.

265
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:34,702
[SPEAKER_10]: And with the change in leadership in the community, they were asking whether or not

266
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:42,599
[SPEAKER_10]: The commitment that was there under Mayor McGlynn for the budget line item would still be present in this year's budget in July.

267
00:12:43,320 --> 00:13:02,486
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think as a council, we should send, along with this paper, a message asking the administration if they would continue, because the budget's created by the mayor, continue the funding of a line item for the Medford Arts Council, and taking it one step further because

268
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:08,052
[SPEAKER_10]: The commitment that we made as a council back some years ago was, you know, we're going to give you an amount of money.

269
00:13:08,112 --> 00:13:10,013
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it was $10,000 or $12,000 at the time.

270
00:13:10,793 --> 00:13:20,317
[SPEAKER_10]: And knowing that was just a small amount in a city of this size, but then to revisit it in a year from now saying, what were you able to accomplish?

271
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:21,957
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this money being well spent?

272
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:29,480
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think everyone behind this reeling, and I won't speak for them, feel that we got our best bang for our buck for that $10,000 or $12,000.

273
00:13:31,371 --> 00:13:33,933
[SPEAKER_10]: and the amount of programming that took place in this community.

274
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:45,601
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask, Mr. President, along with asking the mayor once again for the commitment to the line item in the budget, that we also ask that it be increased, Mr. President.

275
00:13:46,061 --> 00:13:56,848
[SPEAKER_10]: And it seems to be that the $15,000 range from 15 to 30, maybe to 45, would be the next natural progression in this funding.

276
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:59,570
[SPEAKER_10]: And I can just speak for myself that

277
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:12,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I know every penny of that goes towards improving and also reaching out to people in the community to make them aware that the arts are alive and well in this community.

278
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:26,178
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I can make that part of the paper, Mr. President, that in addition to the council citations to the Method Arts Council that we ask that the mayor continue the line item in the budget and also to increase the budget

279
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:32,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, uh, this year, uh, you know, we can put in an amount or not.

280
00:14:32,795 --> 00:14:34,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes it's a double edged sword.

281
00:14:34,716 --> 00:14:36,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, maybe the mayor wants to fund it to 100,000.

282
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:46,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, so, uh, you know, it'd be up to the council, but I think we should just ask for increased funding, Mr. President, in the line item for the city budget.

283
00:14:46,579 --> 00:14:47,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

284
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,599
[SPEAKER_05]: She has budget.

285
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,220
[SPEAKER_05]: So that the, you have that Mr. Clerk.

286
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:52,181
[SPEAKER_10]: So those, those two motions.

287
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:52,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

288
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:53,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Chair recognizes council.

289
00:14:54,302 --> 00:14:55,002
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

290
00:14:55,582 --> 00:14:55,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh,

291
00:14:56,002 --> 00:14:57,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I want to commend this group.

292
00:14:57,143 --> 00:15:02,827
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember when this group first started from a small organization to an award-winning group now.

293
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:05,749
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree 100% with Councilor Marks.

294
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:14,815
[SPEAKER_14]: I was proud to be part of the group that awarded funding for you in the past, and I feel that more funding should be made available too.

295
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:25,002
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the mayor has the same commitment because she has, I think they've already started some, a transition team as an art and culture team,

296
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,531
[SPEAKER_14]: And I commend you for doing that and taking more input from the community to see how we can grow the arts.

297
00:15:31,392 --> 00:15:40,754
[SPEAKER_14]: I also think it's incumbent of us to help you find a home again, seeing that the mall is closed and you're displaced again.

298
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:50,997
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would hope that part of the transition team will be suggestions on finding a home for the method arts in this community.

299
00:15:52,377 --> 00:15:54,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I thank you and I congratulate you on your award.

300
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:56,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

301
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:04,604
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended, a roll call, Mr. Clerk, has been requested on this matter.

302
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:11,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we'd be delighted to before we call the roll.

303
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:13,535
[SPEAKER_05]: We, uh, invite the president to address us.

304
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:16,096
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

305
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:16,616
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

306
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:29,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, uh, first of all, thank you for, uh, recognizing us, uh, today, uh, especially, uh, councilor Falco and council Marks and for your attendance councilor Caraviello at the summit in this very chamber on November 14th.

307
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:37,728
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an incredible experience for the community, envisioning a moment for what could happen in the future.

308
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:42,773
[SPEAKER_01]: We had four themes that day of partnerships.

309
00:16:44,451 --> 00:16:48,656
[SPEAKER_01]: Participation, publicity, and public art.

310
00:16:49,137 --> 00:17:01,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you start thinking long-term, planning with these new resources that the city's providing, having a vision for what can happen when all these isolated efforts are linked together.

311
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:03,053
[SPEAKER_01]: It's truly astonishing.

312
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:08,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's only going to get better for the arts and culture in this community.

313
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:17,999
[SPEAKER_01]: I think not a week goes by that I don't encounter yet another exciting effort that's happening in one of our middle schools and our high school.

314
00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:22,683
[SPEAKER_01]: in an artist organization, in a writer's group, in a performing group.

315
00:17:23,944 --> 00:17:31,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Just learned today that a Medford musician, Shannon Heaton, was awarded a fellowship from the Massachusetts Cultural Council.

316
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:38,197
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's almost on a daily basis where recognition is happening for what's going on in the city.

317
00:17:39,277 --> 00:17:41,820
[SPEAKER_01]: With the funds that you provided us last year,

318
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:59,124
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to increase our granting budget for this calendar year of 2016 by $15,000, so we awarded $45,300 to 62 grants, 62 projects and field trips, which serve hundreds and thousands of members of this community.

319
00:18:00,224 --> 00:18:02,525
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very excited about the future.

320
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:08,546
[SPEAKER_01]: We do believe that your money is being well spent, and we plan to continue doing that.

321
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:11,427
[SPEAKER_01]: 2016 is going to be an even better year for us, I hope.

322
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:11,847
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

323
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:13,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

324
00:18:18,108 --> 00:18:18,588
Thank you.

325
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:23,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice president.

326
00:18:23,629 --> 00:18:24,009
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

327
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,049
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm president Delaware.

328
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:32,831
[SPEAKER_12]: So I, I think council Marks and council Falco said it all, but I just would be remiss if I didn't say, you know, how thankful I am as a Councilor.

329
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:41,012
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I saw, uh, I saw the arts in Medford grow with Maria Daniels and now it's even picking up more so with, um,

330
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:42,128
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Roberts.

331
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:44,930
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to tell you to keep doing what you're doing.

332
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, the interest is growing tenfold.

333
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:56,218
[SPEAKER_12]: And like you said, the amount of people that are affected by a small amount of money and what you're able to do for the community, just think it's great work.

334
00:18:56,478 --> 00:18:58,339
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and keep up the good work.

335
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:58,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

336
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:01,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

337
00:19:01,722 --> 00:19:07,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor on the motion.

338
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:10,468
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll council.

339
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:10,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Caviolo.

340
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:11,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

341
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:12,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

342
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,260
Yes.

343
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

344
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:14,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

345
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:16,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice-President Long and Kern.

346
00:19:16,461 --> 00:19:16,661
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

347
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:17,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks.

348
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:18,302
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

349
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:19,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

350
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:19,923
Yes.

351
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,483
[SPEAKER_02]: President De La Ruccia.

352
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:21,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

353
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:24,945
[SPEAKER_05]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion carries.

354
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:30,107
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to resort back to the regular order of business, all those in favor?

355
00:19:31,328 --> 00:19:35,189
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

356
00:19:35,209 --> 00:19:36,690
[SPEAKER_05]: 16-049 offered by Councilor Marks.

357
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:41,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas delivery trucks are still parking on city sidewalks at the corner of Harvard and Main Street,

358
00:19:41,523 --> 00:20:05,802
[SPEAKER_05]: causing a public safety concern, and whereas, after a neighborhood public safety walk conducted with the area residents and Chief Sacco took place, resulting in the request to relocate the bus stop located at the corner of Harvard and Main Street, then be it resolved that the Metro City Council call for an onsite committee of the whole meeting to relocate the bus stop and request the Traffic Commission to create a loading zone to assist area businesses with deliveries.

359
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:06,543
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

360
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:10,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank you too

361
00:20:10,954 --> 00:20:21,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, for meeting with area residents of the Salt Method area over the weekend to try to resolve this very important, what I consider a public safety concern in the area.

362
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:39,420
[SPEAKER_10]: I think anyone that's tuned into the council meeting has heard over the last at least six months, a year, that there's been a concern with the parking of trucks at the corner of Harvin in Maine, in particular, and also Yield in Maine.

363
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:45,438
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been a real concern of residents for a number of years.

364
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:58,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And after a safety walkthrough, it was recommended by the chief and by a number of area residents that took the walk that ball would be placed on both corners.

365
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:08,812
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think they've done some help in alleviating some of the concern with cars and trucks parking on the corner and on the sidewalk.

366
00:21:10,374 --> 00:21:28,642
[SPEAKER_10]: In particular, on Harvard and Maine, there still is a concern with large trucks, 18-wheelers pulling up, parking down Harvard Street, right on the sidewalk, where it poses a real public safety concern for pedestrians in the neighborhood.

367
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:37,686
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I would ask, Mr. President, and I know we've had a lot on our plate, but I think it's about time that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting on this issue.

368
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:43,750
[SPEAKER_10]: This council has taken several unanimous votes to requesting a committee of the whole meeting.

369
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:46,432
[SPEAKER_10]: But to date, we have not had any.

370
00:21:47,152 --> 00:22:02,479
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would ask that it be on site because the major issue is relocating the bus stop, which is in front of the Oasis Restaurant, possibly down another 20 yards down Main Street, Mr. President.

371
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:05,640
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is not just because we want to relocate a bus stop.

372
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:12,991
[SPEAKER_10]: It's to create a delivery spot, which currently does not exist in that business district.

373
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:14,692
[SPEAKER_10]: You can go to Medford Square.

374
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:15,833
[SPEAKER_10]: There's delivery spots.

375
00:22:16,173 --> 00:22:19,134
[SPEAKER_10]: You can go up to Hillside, which is a very congested area.

376
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,375
[SPEAKER_10]: There's delivery spots.

377
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:25,437
[SPEAKER_10]: Almost every business district has delivery spots for area business.

378
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:27,959
[SPEAKER_10]: However, none exist in this particular area.

379
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:34,622
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we're seeing is that these trucks are being very careless in where

380
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,018
[SPEAKER_10]: They park their rigs.

381
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,080
[SPEAKER_10]: They're only concerned about one thing, and that's to get the product to the business.

382
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:42,221
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what they should be concerned about.

383
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:50,105
[SPEAKER_10]: But we, as a city, Mr. President, and as elected officials, have to be concerned about the public safety in our community.

384
00:22:50,545 --> 00:23:02,831
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know there's a couple of residents that would like to speak, but I would ask, Mr. President, forthwith, and I think you appreciate the situation here and realize that something needs to be done.

385
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:19,720
[SPEAKER_10]: And that Committee of the Whole, on-site Committee of the Whole meeting be addressed with Chief Sacco, with the MBTA, and whoever else wants to attend to address this issue, Mr. President.

386
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:20,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

387
00:23:21,241 --> 00:23:22,601
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take that under advisement.

388
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:26,383
[SPEAKER_05]: As you know, the matter is still in subcommittee on transportation.

389
00:23:27,113 --> 00:23:33,438
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the new chairman, we're going to, uh, uh, urge him to have a swift meeting, uh, to report that out.

390
00:23:34,118 --> 00:23:49,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I can also report to you that the mayor has met with the police chief on the matter, uh, this past week and is urging resolution a on the, um, uh, as directed resolution on a, uh, the parking on the sidewalk.

391
00:23:50,048 --> 00:24:03,479
[SPEAKER_05]: and to make measures of enforcement, uh, and stricter supervision there and B, uh, to, uh, begin dialogue with the MBTA to examine, uh, options for the bus stop, uh, moving.

392
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:07,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

393
00:24:07,203 --> 00:24:07,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

394
00:24:08,484 --> 00:24:15,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I, I along with Councilor Marks, you know, we were there for some of the, I was there with him for some of the walkarounds and, uh, I've gone to, uh, many traffic committee hearings.

395
00:24:16,471 --> 00:24:18,032
[SPEAKER_14]: in regards to these matters.

396
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:33,202
[SPEAKER_14]: And the city did put some bollards in, but I think on the Harvard Street side, the only way to alleviate this would be to put bollards like halfway up the street to stop the parking on that end.

397
00:24:33,243 --> 00:24:40,768
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I drive by there, I see this rocks on the sidewalks, and there was some grassy area, now it's just a mud area.

398
00:24:41,488 --> 00:24:42,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, it's unsightly for the neighbors,

399
00:24:44,669 --> 00:24:46,470
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel for them because I'm down there a lot.

400
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:46,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I see it.

401
00:24:47,511 --> 00:25:07,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, and I'm, I'm glad that the mayor is, um, getting involved with this and, uh, hopefully, uh, with, uh, as a group in the next couple of weeks, uh, and the MBTA will just, uh, the whole city can come up with some type of solution, uh, to end this and, uh, and for the, for the neighborhood.

402
00:25:08,504 --> 00:25:09,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

403
00:25:09,525 --> 00:25:09,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

404
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor chair recognizes the vice president.

405
00:25:12,268 --> 00:25:13,729
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

406
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:19,732
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess my question back to you, if you don't mind, maybe if you have the answer to elaborate.

407
00:25:20,392 --> 00:25:34,979
[SPEAKER_12]: I did email the mayor myself last week with regards to this, because, you know, we've spoken out with our dissatisfaction on trucks parking on the sidewalk, Mack trucks, where people can't traverse our sidewalk.

408
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:40,902
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was very happy to hear that she was meeting with the chief, that Mayor Burke was meeting with the chief of police.

409
00:25:41,642 --> 00:25:58,926
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe you can give us a little bit more detail on their meeting, or if you don't have specific or any more detailed information, maybe Mayor Burke wouldn't mind putting it in writing of exactly what the measures will be to alleviate that problem.

410
00:25:59,546 --> 00:26:03,486
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the directive to the chief specifically with regards to enforcement?

411
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:11,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I think that's something we've asked for, and I think that I would like to see it in writing, specifically what is going to be done.

412
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:19,264
[SPEAKER_12]: How can we tell our residents that are complaining and continuing to send us pictures, what are we going to say to the residents that need to traverse the sidewalks?

413
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:22,706
[SPEAKER_12]: This is going to be done every day, 9, 12, and 5.

414
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:27,949
[SPEAKER_12]: A police officer will be there to do some enforcement.

415
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:30,110
[SPEAKER_12]: I would really like an update on that.

416
00:26:30,751 --> 00:26:38,395
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm very happy, again, to say that there was a meeting and there is some push from the mayor's office for this enforcement, because I think I said it last week.

417
00:26:38,913 --> 00:26:42,454
[SPEAKER_12]: we need the mayor on board with this or else it's not going to happen.

418
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:58,701
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I don't have any, uh, specific details, um, uh, as far as, uh, steps a, B, C and D, but I know, uh, she, uh, has indicated to me as well as the police chief has indicated to me that they both very serious about this.

419
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:08,625
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd also add that at the meeting, uh, efforts were made, uh, or, or people from, uh, code enforcement and the board of health,

420
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:13,417
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also directed to examine some of the other complaints that were lodged there.

421
00:27:14,037 --> 00:27:26,265
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, uh, uh, as council president, uh, in, uh, someone who communicates regularly to the membership of the council from the mayor, but, uh, certainly you don't need me to do that.

422
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:31,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, uh, nonetheless, uh, they're, they're working on it.

423
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:36,912
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems quite clear and, uh, and I'm quite delighted to see such action taken.

424
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:37,952
[SPEAKER_12]: Me too.

425
00:27:38,493 --> 00:27:39,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, if we could just,

426
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,481
[SPEAKER_12]: possibly if she wouldn't mind, um, Ms.

427
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:45,722
[SPEAKER_12]: Burke wouldn't, Mayor Burke wouldn't mind just giving us a further update on that meeting.

428
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:46,542
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be helpful.

429
00:27:46,562 --> 00:27:54,484
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we know what the board of health was asked to do, what the code enforcement, just to keep staying in the loop so that we can advise, um, appropriately.

430
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

431
00:27:56,644 --> 00:27:58,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

432
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:00,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, thank you very much, Mr. President.

433
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:04,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the resolution before us is calling for an onsite committee of the whole meeting.

434
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:06,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It might make sense to invite the administration.

435
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,103
[SPEAKER_03]: to come and present to us what their solutions are while we're all there together on location.

436
00:28:12,724 --> 00:28:18,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And looking at the issue, I mean, we'll talk about this until we're blue in the face, but it's an enforcement issue, Mr. President.

437
00:28:18,608 --> 00:28:19,609
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an enforcement issue.

438
00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:23,852
[SPEAKER_03]: It's whether or not vehicles parking on the street are being appropriately ticketed.

439
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:25,793
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the answer that we all know is no.

440
00:28:26,994 --> 00:28:28,615
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a parking issue, Mr. President.

441
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:31,377
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to figure out where we're going to put these vehicles when they need to make

442
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:40,962
[SPEAKER_03]: deliveries so that these businesses and our business sisters can be successful, but so there's also a balance between the neighborhood and the business concerns, Mr. President.

443
00:28:40,982 --> 00:28:43,903
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, I'd again like to amend the paper.

444
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:59,987
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the same way we did last week to ask for directed patrols at Harvard, Maine, and Yale during the day, Mr. President, so that our patrolmen, when they are out there, will make a concerted effort to continue to enforce the violators.

445
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:00,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

446
00:29:01,483 --> 00:29:05,084
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, if I can also add, I apologize for speaking from the chair.

447
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:07,284
[SPEAKER_05]: If anybody wishes me to stop, I will.

448
00:29:07,764 --> 00:29:11,805
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, I, uh, also know that this will also be part of this.

449
00:29:11,845 --> 00:29:31,330
[SPEAKER_05]: The, uh, subcommittee or the committee transition committee on economic and business development, uh, will give, as we have our neighborhood meetings, uh, residents, store owners, and all will have a ample opportunity to point out those areas that need improvement and, um, and see what works better in each of the business districts.

450
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:45,556
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, we have our first meeting tomorrow night at the Roberts School to address Haines Square and all the details are available on the city website for that meeting because sometimes I get my times confused.

451
00:29:45,836 --> 00:29:47,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

452
00:29:48,218 --> 00:29:48,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

453
00:29:49,018 --> 00:29:52,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to thank Councilor Marks for bringing up this resolution.

454
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:59,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We've all received many emails regarding this issue and it's a public safety issue that needs to be addressed.

455
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:01,089
[SPEAKER_09]: as soon as possible.

456
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:07,372
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm hoping that the subcommittee can hopefully take action on this soon so we can have the Committee of the Whole meeting ASAP.

457
00:30:07,592 --> 00:30:13,816
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just wanted to also thank the resident for bringing this to our attention.

458
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:19,319
[SPEAKER_09]: We've received many emails, and it's important that people reach out to us when they do have problems in their neighborhoods.

459
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:22,821
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wanna say support this 100%.

460
00:30:22,861 --> 00:30:23,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.

461
00:30:23,962 --> 00:30:24,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

462
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:25,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

463
00:30:27,965 --> 00:30:28,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

464
00:30:28,505 --> 00:30:28,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

465
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:30,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Please state your name and address for the record.

466
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:30,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

467
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:32,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street.

468
00:30:33,909 --> 00:30:36,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I thank you for bringing this to the fore.

469
00:30:37,311 --> 00:30:38,512
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a long time coming.

470
00:30:38,552 --> 00:30:43,014
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Lungo and Councilor Marks for putting it on the agenda.

471
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:46,537
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be a joint effort.

472
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:47,037
[SPEAKER_08]: It's true.

473
00:30:47,117 --> 00:30:48,378
[SPEAKER_08]: It's enforcement.

474
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:56,663
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very large piece, but we are not unaware of the fact that these businesses have to function successfully to remain there.

475
00:30:57,323 --> 00:31:12,708
[SPEAKER_08]: and we'd like to help in terms of actually having a place for them to make the deliveries, but that's safe and not on sidewalks and not interrupting the peaceful enjoyment of our homes and our streets.

476
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:16,289
[SPEAKER_08]: So I look forward to action on this.

477
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:20,951
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that we as residents will be invited to participate.

478
00:31:21,591 --> 00:31:25,432
[SPEAKER_08]: I also hope that the businesses will participate because it's actually

479
00:31:25,923 --> 00:31:29,504
[SPEAKER_08]: They are benefiting greatly from this if we do, in fact, get a loading zone.

480
00:31:30,065 --> 00:31:38,568
[SPEAKER_08]: I know on Yale Street, the curb that was once dropped has now been restored, and I think it obviates the need for the bollards.

481
00:31:38,628 --> 00:31:49,472
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think we need bollards at that point as long as that is enforced, and we don't have people driving up over the curb to park next to the building, which is what they were doing.

482
00:31:51,272 --> 00:31:55,154
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, we need clear definition of where

483
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:58,034
[SPEAKER_08]: handicap ramp is, access ramp is.

484
00:31:58,074 --> 00:32:05,337
[SPEAKER_08]: We need markings on the loading zone and pedestrian walkway there.

485
00:32:05,377 --> 00:32:07,878
[SPEAKER_08]: The handicap access is not marked.

486
00:32:08,418 --> 00:32:11,259
[SPEAKER_08]: People do park right over that.

487
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:19,623
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are many aspects of this, and I, for one, would enjoy participating and finding resolutions to this.

488
00:32:20,043 --> 00:32:22,944
[SPEAKER_08]: I know some people were upset with the curb going back up.

489
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:24,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they've calmed down somewhat.

490
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:33,073
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also know that the delivery guys from Maze Cafe, for instance, are not using the loading zone on Yale Street.

491
00:32:33,273 --> 00:32:34,873
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a designated loading zone.

492
00:32:34,893 --> 00:32:35,933
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not marked off.

493
00:32:36,394 --> 00:32:37,214
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a sign.

494
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:43,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked him, he walks all the way down to the public lot to get in his car and make the deliveries.

495
00:32:43,876 --> 00:32:45,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, why aren't you using the loading zone?

496
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:46,777
[SPEAKER_08]: He said, he gets ticketed.

497
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:49,578
[SPEAKER_08]: So perhaps there can be some

498
00:32:50,568 --> 00:33:07,320
[SPEAKER_08]: immediate action to inform them that maybe they can park there to make deliveries, maybe something could be indicated in that regard so they're not getting ticketed and they're parking at the beginning of Yale rather than in the public lot and walking down and people's food will be getting cold when they get it brought to the door.

499
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,124
[SPEAKER_08]: But as a resident, I'm more than willing to cooperate with the businesses.

500
00:33:12,204 --> 00:33:19,109
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just it has become an issue of safety and we've been going round and round and round with this.

501
00:33:20,858 --> 00:33:24,440
[SPEAKER_08]: we can finally find a path to move forward on it.

502
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:33,123
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you've all seen the pictures that Mrs. Fritz provided, and one picture is worth a thousand words.

503
00:33:34,204 --> 00:33:36,364
[SPEAKER_08]: It speaks for itself.

504
00:33:36,445 --> 00:33:45,128
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to eradicate that problem, and I'm more than willing to do my part, and hopefully the city will do theirs.

505
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:49,150
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks as though we're moving forward on this, so I have some hope.

506
00:33:50,298 --> 00:33:54,600
[SPEAKER_08]: And hopefully, we'll resolve this satisfactorily for all concerned.

507
00:33:55,321 --> 00:33:55,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

508
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:00,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

509
00:34:00,103 --> 00:34:00,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

510
00:34:00,564 --> 00:34:02,204
[SPEAKER_05]: Please state your name and address for the record.

511
00:34:02,485 --> 00:34:02,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

512
00:34:03,185 --> 00:34:04,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Anne Fretz, 215 Harvard Street.

513
00:34:05,846 --> 00:34:16,332
[SPEAKER_13]: And to pick up on Anita's last comment, I had a quote written by Stephen Mamet, the playwright, who said, we all hope it's what keeps us alive, which is what keeps me coming back here.

514
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:17,476
[SPEAKER_13]: ad nauseam.

515
00:34:17,596 --> 00:34:19,257
[SPEAKER_13]: My apologies for appearing again.

516
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:33,102
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, I wish to thank the city council members for allowing me to frequently appear before you, sending feedback about our neighborhood, respond to phone calls and meet with us to discuss existing public safety conditions and potential solutions.

517
00:34:33,162 --> 00:34:37,684
[SPEAKER_13]: We have lots of ideas, yet we don't have any solution as of yet.

518
00:34:38,624 --> 00:34:42,826
[SPEAKER_13]: In particular, I want to thank Michael Marks for the bus stop resolution being addressed today.

519
00:34:43,354 --> 00:34:47,017
[SPEAKER_13]: and Brianna Longo-Cohen for last week's parking enforcement discussion.

520
00:34:47,598 --> 00:35:08,596
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to express my gratitude to Directors Karen Rose and Paul Mokey, Inspector Kimberly Fowler, and Constant Resource Building and Code Enforcement Officer John Bevuso, and Mayor Burke, in particular, for responding to requests for assistance for residents confronting a variety of health and quality of life issues at 159 Harvard Street.

521
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:14,427
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm grateful for their prompt actions and involvement in several long-term issues.

522
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:19,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I really want to thank all of you, in particular Mayor Burke.

523
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:27,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Our South Medford Square is a troubled square impacted by the rapid and unfettered growth of one restaurant.

524
00:35:28,354 --> 00:35:34,377
[SPEAKER_13]: We need corrective action to improve the quality of life for residents, the business owners, and the general public.

525
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:39,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke has planned economic meetings to assess where we are and where we need to be

526
00:35:39,868 --> 00:35:44,511
[SPEAKER_13]: for Medford's commercial success, satisfying the residents in the area.

527
00:35:44,831 --> 00:35:46,072
[SPEAKER_13]: I totally support this.

528
00:35:46,152 --> 00:35:48,153
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the best way to proceed.

529
00:35:48,514 --> 00:36:00,641
[SPEAKER_13]: The bus stop move, like the need for more parking enforcement, cannot wait, as it's critical for public safety, necessary for the survival of current commerce in all residents in South Medford Square neighborhood.

530
00:36:01,202 --> 00:36:05,705
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been addressing this concern for about three years, with no change to the current situation.

531
00:36:05,905 --> 00:36:09,407
[SPEAKER_13]: We're pretty much flaming out with physical risk to the public escalating.

532
00:36:09,953 --> 00:36:13,837
[SPEAKER_13]: There does seem to be some measure of public enforcement.

533
00:36:13,937 --> 00:36:23,367
[SPEAKER_13]: But driving down there yesterday, I noticed we now have bike motorcycles tied to the posts on the sidewalks on Main Street.

534
00:36:23,908 --> 00:36:24,969
[SPEAKER_13]: There were some this summer.

535
00:36:25,009 --> 00:36:26,050
[SPEAKER_13]: There are more there now.

536
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:28,853
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if they're employees or customers of Oasis.

537
00:36:29,393 --> 00:36:32,797
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's a motor vehicle that drives up onto the sidewalk.

538
00:36:35,582 --> 00:36:39,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Residents and the general public need safe sidewalks to walk on, healthier to breathe.

539
00:36:40,205 --> 00:36:46,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Schoolchildren in school buses who terminate at that corner need a safe zone for stops and walking.

540
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:52,953
[SPEAKER_13]: And the MBTA serving all citizens need a safe place to disembark and get on the bus.

541
00:36:53,013 --> 00:36:58,797
[SPEAKER_13]: They need to have it closed, as these ladies have often mentioned.

542
00:36:59,497 --> 00:37:04,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Currently, it's safer to walk on Main Street sometimes than it is to walk on the Harvard Street sidewalks.

543
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:10,485
[SPEAKER_13]: given the flow of traffic on the sidewalks, including the motorcycles, customer vehicles, delivery trucks, and bicycles.

544
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:18,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Reasons point to unchecked growth in a densely populated area, part of which I'm guilty of.

545
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,473
[SPEAKER_13]: We had 100 people move into the Lincoln County condos during 2009 and 2010.

546
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:34,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Prior to that, in 2006, Oasis owners spent a million dollars to buy a block of stores.

547
00:37:34,868 --> 00:37:45,599
[SPEAKER_13]: They increased their small business area with limited seating to three storefronts on half the block, operating from 6 a.m.

548
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:48,922
[SPEAKER_13]: to 11 a.m., whether they had a permit to do so or not.

549
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:56,280
[SPEAKER_13]: They are now able to accommodate 200 seated guests or more in their restaurant.

550
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:06,803
[SPEAKER_13]: So we basically doubled the number of seats in a restaurant, the number of vehicles in that particular square over a very short period of time, over a four or five year period.

551
00:38:07,323 --> 00:38:11,844
[SPEAKER_13]: None of the abutters were informed of the two expansions that Oasis went through.

552
00:38:12,084 --> 00:38:14,705
[SPEAKER_13]: This is one thing we should look at with our city ordinances.

553
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:19,906
[SPEAKER_13]: How did they expand so rapidly without any notice to us, the abutters,

554
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:25,914
[SPEAKER_13]: any input from the abutters, and now we're seeing the results of it and begging for support.

555
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:36,016
[SPEAKER_13]: Two expansions, just double the size right to what Bocelli said, and forgive me for repeating myself.

556
00:38:36,796 --> 00:38:47,098
[SPEAKER_13]: All of these expansions occurred without City Hall prior to 2016, adjusting limits, lending advice, or building a commerce support system

557
00:38:47,595 --> 00:39:00,665
[SPEAKER_13]: such as moving a loading zone or adding a loading zone to support Oasis fitting into an already established neighborhood that was also expanding at the same time.

558
00:39:01,686 --> 00:39:08,771
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that Ron Lopez purchased the Lincoln School and the Kennedy School in 2007, and our unit was completed in 2010.

559
00:39:08,871 --> 00:39:16,417
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a side note, but Oasis tripled in size over the past

560
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:34,519
[SPEAKER_13]: three years without increasing the size of their waste management facilities until the neighbors intervened due to chronically overflowing dumpsters filled to the brim and doubling the size with their smelly trash.

561
00:39:34,919 --> 00:39:36,899
[SPEAKER_13]: That promoted the growth of rats in the area.

562
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:42,362
[SPEAKER_13]: The people who live at 159 have had rats infiltrating their patio during the summer.

563
00:39:43,062 --> 00:39:45,983
[SPEAKER_13]: That was brought into control, yet we're seeing them again from

564
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:50,851
[SPEAKER_13]: in front of their condo, all the way down to Berwick, on the street, alive and dead.

565
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:54,012
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's one of the issues that the city is addressing at this point.

566
00:39:56,032 --> 00:40:04,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Neighbors of South Medford Square have long felt their concerns have gone unheard or dismissed, much like the first complaints by the residents of Flint, Michigan, who complained about the water.

567
00:40:04,954 --> 00:40:14,096
[SPEAKER_13]: We are of the opinion that parking enforcement is but one measure that can greatly improve residents' quality of life and easing of stress on the businesses in South Medford Square.

568
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:23,675
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been advocating through all relevant avenues available to us for City Hall to enforce the town's laws or the city's laws.

569
00:40:24,135 --> 00:40:26,216
[SPEAKER_13]: These are not laws we're asking for.

570
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:27,356
[SPEAKER_13]: These are laws that exist.

571
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:34,259
[SPEAKER_13]: If you look at a parking ticket or a parking violation, parking on sidewalks, parking on hash marks, they're all there.

572
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:44,843
[SPEAKER_13]: We just don't have the manpower in the public safety groups, whether it be the Republic Parking or

573
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:48,749
[SPEAKER_13]: police department to support our own laws.

574
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:51,330
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's going to change.

575
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,891
[SPEAKER_13]: I can hope that changes with Mayor Burke.

576
00:40:55,372 --> 00:41:04,157
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to support the traffic division, specifically in the police department, to move the trailer trucks and haulers off Harvard Street.

577
00:41:04,497 --> 00:41:07,699
[SPEAKER_13]: We have many roadblocks and naysayers that add to this.

578
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,960
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not just dealing with trucks on the sidewalk.

579
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,261
[SPEAKER_13]: We're dealing with them hauling back and forth.

580
00:41:12,561 --> 00:41:13,882
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a tremendous area.

581
00:41:17,594 --> 00:41:21,816
[SPEAKER_13]: For a long time, we didn't have the commercial centers with shops and restaurants.

582
00:41:22,276 --> 00:41:35,161
[SPEAKER_13]: So said Medford native, Nancy McLaughlin, as she was writing about the newly proclaimed hottest city in Boston was the South Medford neighborhood, which is great.

583
00:41:36,802 --> 00:41:42,304
[SPEAKER_13]: And we would like to see everyone coming to our South Medford Square and improve the area.

584
00:41:42,924 --> 00:41:44,425
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that city councilor,

585
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:54,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Dello Russo, Mr. President, and Anita D'Antonio and I shared some of those discussions on what we could do to draw.

586
00:41:54,580 --> 00:42:03,642
[SPEAKER_13]: Oasis is a huge draw for Main Street, as is Bocelli, as evidenced by the constant replenishment of food, beverages, and supplies to their location by their purveyors.

587
00:42:04,402 --> 00:42:08,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, their rapid and unsupported growth has been at the expense of the residents in the neighborhood.

588
00:42:08,963 --> 00:42:10,103
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't emphasize that more.

589
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:11,723
[SPEAKER_13]: We just didn't have any say in it.

590
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:12,544
[SPEAKER_13]: It just happened.

591
00:42:12,944 --> 00:42:14,984
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been asking for support and help

592
00:42:15,543 --> 00:42:19,324
[SPEAKER_13]: to help them be a better neighbor to us.

593
00:42:19,464 --> 00:42:23,046
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can go through everything they're doing wrong, but that's not fair to them at this point.

594
00:42:28,328 --> 00:42:43,793
[SPEAKER_13]: I would just like to say that moving the bus stop, installing five or six no parking, no standing, no stopping signs from the corner of Harvard and Main Street

595
00:42:44,422 --> 00:42:50,648
[SPEAKER_13]: at the traffic lights down to the driveway at 215 Harvard Street would be a huge improvement.

596
00:42:50,749 --> 00:42:56,154
[SPEAKER_13]: It would also be a temporary blockage to anyone wishing to park along the sidewalk there.

597
00:42:57,135 --> 00:43:05,644
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, it wouldn't cost more than $500 for the raw material of the posts and the signs at the labor costs in

598
00:43:06,421 --> 00:43:26,225
[SPEAKER_13]: to dig holes and what you would encounter putting them in there would be earth, as Councilman Caraviello said, there's pits now where we used to have grass, there's cracked concrete, which the science can be driven through, and there's probably two areas where you would have to actually drill a hole.

599
00:43:26,685 --> 00:43:28,166
[SPEAKER_13]: That's something we could do tomorrow.

600
00:43:28,726 --> 00:43:34,027
[SPEAKER_13]: That's something I would urge having done until we can move the bus stop and change everything.

601
00:43:35,507 --> 00:43:38,307
[SPEAKER_13]: putting those signs up will do, will protect the residents in the area.

602
00:43:38,668 --> 00:43:39,948
[SPEAKER_13]: We can't use our sidewalks.

603
00:43:40,428 --> 00:43:42,328
[SPEAKER_13]: My little dog will be two years old in May.

604
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,609
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't walk the sidewalks down there because it's unsafe.

605
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:48,909
[SPEAKER_13]: We haven't been able to walk on them for about a year and a half now.

606
00:43:49,850 --> 00:44:02,612
[SPEAKER_13]: I thank you all for your time and your effort to change this, but I would urge that we do a committee of the whole and do a physical tour as we did back in October of 2014 and recognize the needs and deal with it.

607
00:44:03,112 --> 00:44:03,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your time.

608
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,671
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Anne.

609
00:44:06,892 --> 00:44:09,494
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilman Marks for approval, all those in favor?

610
00:44:10,975 --> 00:44:11,535
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended.

611
00:44:12,096 --> 00:44:12,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilman Marks.

612
00:44:13,056 --> 00:44:14,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Just if I could, Mr. President.

613
00:44:14,438 --> 00:44:15,098
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion.

614
00:44:15,258 --> 00:44:22,704
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Anne brings up a great temporary fix for the Harvard Main Corner with the signage that she mentioned.

615
00:44:23,605 --> 00:44:28,689
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask that this council send that recommendation, Mr. President, to the Traffic Commission.

616
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:30,550
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's only a temporary fix.

617
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:31,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

618
00:44:31,611 --> 00:44:34,333
[SPEAKER_10]: But the no standing, no stopping signs

619
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:36,213
[SPEAKER_10]: how many they believe is needed.

620
00:44:36,233 --> 00:44:38,595
[SPEAKER_10]: You said four or five, but six.

621
00:44:38,935 --> 00:44:46,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever the Traffic Commission feels is necessary to solve that issue, Mr. President, I would ask that that be sent.

622
00:44:47,482 --> 00:44:56,869
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, Anne mentioned about Method, Salt Method in particular, receiving recognition, Mr. President.

623
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:03,835
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is a real estate brokerage firm, Redfin, which is a nationally known real estate brokerage firm

624
00:45:04,305 --> 00:45:07,788
[SPEAKER_10]: once a year comes out with their three hottest Boston neighborhoods.

625
00:45:08,729 --> 00:45:14,653
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, it's amazing to see Method number one, Cambridge and Somerville two and three.

626
00:45:16,034 --> 00:45:18,476
[SPEAKER_10]: You see how the tide is changing, Mr. President.

627
00:45:18,877 --> 00:45:28,264
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's incumbent upon us and groups like SMARTO and other involved residents in the South Method area to keep doing what they're doing.

628
00:45:28,775 --> 00:45:31,636
[SPEAKER_10]: because they're not doing it on behalf of themselves.

629
00:45:31,676 --> 00:45:35,117
[SPEAKER_10]: They're doing it on behalf of improving the quality of life in that neighborhood.

630
00:45:35,657 --> 00:45:43,299
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're already seeing the benefits of being named number one hottest market, real estate market, in Boston.

631
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:51,581
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an amazing, amazing feat, Mr. President, knowing that, in my opinion, very little has been done.

632
00:45:52,361 --> 00:45:54,001
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm not speaking out of school.

633
00:45:54,281 --> 00:45:57,622
[SPEAKER_10]: Very little has been done in the South Medford area, Mr. President.

634
00:45:57,952 --> 00:46:05,697
[SPEAKER_10]: to improve any type of pedestrian safety, to improve traffic flow, to improve business and economic development in the area.

635
00:46:06,317 --> 00:46:09,339
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, we're seeing that it's a hot market.

636
00:46:09,999 --> 00:46:27,050
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think as a community, it's incumbent upon us to parlay that into really moving forward these traffic improvements, pedestrian safety improvements, and making the South Medford area something that our

637
00:46:27,467 --> 00:46:37,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Neighboring communities will envy, Mr. President, the same way we envied what they did in Somerville and a lot of their business districts.

638
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:40,170
[SPEAKER_10]: We could be that, Mr. President.

639
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:47,452
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's starting to make a turn, but only if the city is able to cooperate and move these issues forward.

640
00:46:47,492 --> 00:46:55,534
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to thank Anne Fretz and Anita D'Antonio for coming up tonight.

641
00:46:55,554 --> 00:46:57,054
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank Jim Silva.

642
00:46:57,541 --> 00:47:08,150
[SPEAKER_10]: from the Salt Method Neighborhood Group, SMARTO, who organizes a lot of what goes on in that area and gets feedback from area residents.

643
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:16,457
[SPEAKER_10]: And I look forward, Mr. President, to a Salt Method that we're all going to be very proud of in the future, Mr. President.

644
00:47:17,478 --> 00:47:18,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

645
00:47:18,679 --> 00:47:19,840
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended, Mr. Clerk.

646
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:21,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

647
00:47:21,988 --> 00:47:24,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I'd ask that the questions be separated.

648
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:42,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I understand the reasoning for Councilor Marks bringing the last portion of the last amendment up, if the purpose of the council to go on site to have a committee of the whole meeting to talk with the traffic commission to see what we can do to move the bus stop and to improve the loading zone, I think that maybe we want to start from scratch.

649
00:47:42,047 --> 00:47:44,910
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we go down there and we already start making recommendations without

650
00:47:45,348 --> 00:47:50,672
[SPEAKER_03]: first sitting down and actually having the dialogue, I think that we're putting the cart a little bit before the horse, Mr. President.

651
00:47:51,232 --> 00:47:55,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd ask that the amendments be separated and be severed.

652
00:47:55,735 --> 00:47:58,817
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fully supportive of all the other amendments that were filed.

653
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:06,643
[SPEAKER_03]: However, at this point in time, I'm not comfortable supporting the erection of any signage until we can go actually on site and meet with the traffic commission to talk about what the options are.

654
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:09,605
[SPEAKER_05]: So the resolution is that the Medford City Council

655
00:48:10,794 --> 00:48:20,677
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, actually it would be the president of the city council would call for a, uh, committee of the whole meeting on site to relocate the bus stop and request the traffic commission to create a loading zone.

656
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to separate traffic commission.

657
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:26,279
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the initial, that was the initial paper, right?

658
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:26,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

659
00:48:26,999 --> 00:48:37,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, vote would vote to put the committee of the whole process in session and in motion rather than I amended for director patrols at the area until we can get this meeting done.

660
00:48:38,602 --> 00:48:39,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

661
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:40,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had several other amendments as well.

662
00:48:40,825 --> 00:48:42,206
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were several other amendments as well.

663
00:48:42,967 --> 00:48:46,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I really just have a problem with the amendment of putting up signage at this point in time.

664
00:48:46,171 --> 00:48:55,902
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're going down there to try to determine what's going to work best, I think that we should go down there and have an actual picture of what's going on as opposed to changing what's going on there right now and then going down and taking a look.

665
00:48:55,942 --> 00:48:58,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if we're going on the site, if we're going to the site to see the problems,

666
00:48:58,818 --> 00:49:01,340
[SPEAKER_03]: we put up the signs, the problems aren't going to be there anymore, right?

667
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:06,283
[SPEAKER_03]: So why aren't we going to go down there and witness what these problems are, show what an actual effect it is going to, it is having on the neighborhood.

668
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,884
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've all heard it before, Mr. President, there's, there's no doubt about that.

669
00:49:09,565 --> 00:49:13,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, however, I think that it would be best to be, uh, to be dealt with as a clean slate.

670
00:49:13,107 --> 00:49:17,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go down there and let's take a look at it in its current state of disrepair so that we can come up with a comprehensive plan.

671
00:49:20,152 --> 00:49:21,493
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information council members.

672
00:49:21,593 --> 00:49:28,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And I appreciate what council and I just had to say, uh, I consider this, uh, like the residents, a temporary fix.

673
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:33,903
[SPEAKER_10]: As we heard from the council president, this particular issue is already in the transportation subcommittee.

674
00:49:34,363 --> 00:49:37,504
[SPEAKER_10]: So it has to be voted on by the transportation subcommittee.

675
00:49:37,904 --> 00:49:40,804
[SPEAKER_10]: If I'm correct, Mr. President, I think that's what you were alluding to.

676
00:49:40,824 --> 00:49:50,106
[SPEAKER_10]: And the, it's under the council purview to move the bus stop, but the loading zone is not under the council purview.

677
00:49:50,146 --> 00:49:51,447
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be under the traffic commission.

678
00:49:51,887 --> 00:49:57,828
[SPEAKER_10]: So then we have to take another step, even when we do eventually move the bus stop, we have to wait for the traffic commission to meet.

679
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,881
[SPEAKER_10]: which, but they don't meet every day.

680
00:49:59,941 --> 00:50:03,203
[SPEAKER_10]: They meet twice a month, once a month.

681
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:13,448
[SPEAKER_10]: So you may be talking several months out before, and I know you're saying enforcement, but in my opinion, the enforcement will happen for a day or two and then it'll stop happening.

682
00:50:13,709 --> 00:50:14,709
[SPEAKER_10]: That's only my opinion.

683
00:50:15,189 --> 00:50:22,173
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd rather have signage at least there on a temporary basis, but you know, I don't mind separating it cause I'm going to vote.

684
00:50:22,213 --> 00:50:27,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I just, I don't think we should put up any signage if we're going to go down there and ask the traffic commission to do a comprehensive review.

685
00:50:27,513 --> 00:50:29,634
[SPEAKER_03]: And to go forward and to come up with a plan, let's let them do that.

686
00:50:29,714 --> 00:50:31,754
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're asking for enforcement anyhow.

687
00:50:32,134 --> 00:50:32,915
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's get the enforcement.

688
00:50:32,955 --> 00:50:34,315
[SPEAKER_03]: People know they're not supposed to park on the sidewalk.

689
00:50:34,355 --> 00:50:35,635
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's clear.

690
00:50:35,675 --> 00:50:39,756
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of them ignoring the rules, regulations, and so forth, Mr. President.

691
00:50:39,856 --> 00:50:41,597
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, I rest my case.

692
00:50:41,757 --> 00:50:43,297
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've explained where I'm coming from.

693
00:50:43,317 --> 00:50:44,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So you still have the motion to sever?

694
00:50:44,738 --> 00:50:45,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have a motion to sever, yes.

695
00:50:46,178 --> 00:50:49,779
[SPEAKER_03]: It can just be the last amendment, Mr. President, because I'm fully supportive of the rest of the paper.

696
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:50,479
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

697
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:52,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Ma'am?

698
00:50:52,873 --> 00:50:55,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Anne Fretz, 215 Harvard Street.

699
00:50:55,515 --> 00:51:05,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Long-suffering blocked sidewalks, unable to walk down them, was last here October 27, 2015, asking for relief from the area.

700
00:51:06,465 --> 00:51:18,115
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know how many weeks it is, or how many days, or how many trucks, but even with the parking enforcement, people don't respect the world of no parking on the sidewalks.

701
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,677
[SPEAKER_13]: I've written God knows how many letters to the truck

702
00:51:21,075 --> 00:51:24,456
[SPEAKER_13]: haulers themselves, the presidents of the company, and it continues.

703
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:30,679
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't understand why we can't put a temporary measure up for public safety to protect pedestrians.

704
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:32,020
[SPEAKER_13]: This is ridiculous.

705
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,640
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

706
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,221
[SPEAKER_13]: Forgive me for getting so upset.

707
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:37,742
[SPEAKER_13]: But to let you know, Jim Silva would be here this evening.

708
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:41,204
[SPEAKER_13]: He's away on vacation, a much deserved vacation, supporting the city.

709
00:51:42,284 --> 00:51:48,947
[SPEAKER_13]: And I put a resolution with a list of 10 items, one of which was temporary installation of

710
00:51:49,735 --> 00:52:03,365
[SPEAKER_13]: No parking, no stopping, no standing signs for the length of Harvard Street, where I might add that bollards were approved to be installed and were never installed around the corner to prevent trucks from parking on the parking lot.

711
00:52:03,886 --> 00:52:04,686
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going nowhere.

712
00:52:05,367 --> 00:52:06,608
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got parking enforcement.

713
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:10,591
[SPEAKER_13]: And as Mr. Marks kindly said, it lasts for a day.

714
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:12,852
[SPEAKER_13]: They relax, and the trucks come back.

715
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:13,893
[SPEAKER_13]: It's cyclical.

716
00:52:14,253 --> 00:52:15,694
[SPEAKER_13]: We've seen three years of it.

717
00:52:15,714 --> 00:52:17,055
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm starting to froth at the mouth.

718
00:52:17,516 --> 00:52:17,936
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

719
00:52:18,356 --> 00:52:18,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all.

720
00:52:21,395 --> 00:52:26,059
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for approval, we have a motion to sever all those.

721
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:28,120
[SPEAKER_14]: The last amendment.

722
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

723
00:52:29,641 --> 00:52:30,302
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a question.

724
00:52:30,402 --> 00:52:37,347
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if our DPW has access to those plastic Jersey barriers.

725
00:52:39,569 --> 00:52:46,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that would be a faster solution to put maybe some of those up there instead of signs that say, I don't know.

726
00:52:46,574 --> 00:52:48,375
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't, I don't know if we have them in our city.

727
00:52:48,696 --> 00:52:50,517
[SPEAKER_14]: I might tend to stand this as a resolution.

728
00:52:51,405 --> 00:53:05,610
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just asking that we look into if the city, if the city has plastic, uh, they, they have Jersey barriers that are plastic and they can go in, uh, almost immediately and come out as, uh, uh, as, as needed.

729
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

730
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:17,494
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we amended that the, uh, DPW, uh, installed temporary plastic, if they have them in the building, they may have them in that place and they'll be able to go up tomorrow.

731
00:53:18,174 --> 00:53:18,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

732
00:53:19,035 --> 00:53:20,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

733
00:53:20,648 --> 00:53:21,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

734
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:22,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a quick question.

735
00:53:22,289 --> 00:53:26,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if you know the answer to this, but do we know when the bollards were approved?

736
00:53:26,893 --> 00:53:27,453
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that.

737
00:53:27,473 --> 00:53:29,835
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's prior to me being elected, so I'm just kind of just.

738
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:36,160
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be a communication from the Traffic Commission to inform us of that.

739
00:53:38,763 --> 00:53:41,565
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a whole year?

740
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:41,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

741
00:53:45,605 --> 00:53:47,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know who's responsible for installing those?

742
00:53:47,626 --> 00:53:49,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know why they haven't been installed?

743
00:53:49,147 --> 00:53:52,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know if we paid for them and they've just never been installed?

744
00:53:52,549 --> 00:53:53,630
[SPEAKER_09]: These are questions that I have.

745
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:54,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm kind of curious.

746
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:56,491
[SPEAKER_09]: A whole year has gone by.

747
00:53:57,031 --> 00:53:59,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Some have been installed.

748
00:53:59,973 --> 00:54:01,054
[SPEAKER_14]: Two or three and two or three.

749
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,015
[SPEAKER_14]: One councilor at a time, please.

750
00:54:03,075 --> 00:54:09,218
[SPEAKER_09]: I was down in the neighborhood last night and Councilor Caraviello was there as well.

751
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:13,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And we noticed there were two bollards that were installed in the corner of Harvard and Maine.

752
00:54:14,111 --> 00:54:15,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we know when those were installed?

753
00:54:16,652 --> 00:54:17,632
[SPEAKER_14]: During the fall.

754
00:54:18,032 --> 00:54:18,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

755
00:54:18,392 --> 00:54:18,892
[SPEAKER_14]: The fall.

756
00:54:24,814 --> 00:54:30,055
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

757
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:34,196
[SPEAKER_09]: And those aren't really doing the job because

758
00:54:34,948 --> 00:54:43,771
[SPEAKER_09]: There's still, I've seen the pictures, all four wheels of these trucks are on top of the sidewalk, which is completely, does not make any sense at all.

759
00:54:43,831 --> 00:54:52,474
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and the Council Member Marks had mentioned it before, it really sounds like we need to install bollards up a good portion of Harvard Ave.

760
00:54:52,734 --> 00:54:53,695
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

761
00:54:54,055 --> 00:54:54,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

762
00:54:55,615 --> 00:54:57,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Ma'am, you wish to speak to us?

763
00:54:57,516 --> 00:54:57,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

764
00:54:58,036 --> 00:55:00,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Please state your name and address for the record.

765
00:55:02,028 --> 00:55:05,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixed J Spalding, 3610 Mystic Valley Parkway, Bedford, Mass.

766
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:15,511
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering if we aren't circling the wagon about trucks being on the sidewalk here.

767
00:55:15,531 --> 00:55:17,131
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't unique to Oasis.

768
00:55:17,211 --> 00:55:24,033
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week we were talking about the exact same thing regarding commercial vehicles parking on sidewalks throughout the city of Medford.

769
00:55:24,813 --> 00:55:33,016
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not you put ballards or a plastic cone out, if there's no enforcement, there's no enforcement.

770
00:55:33,076 --> 00:55:37,117
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering if we've heard back from Chief Sacco.

771
00:55:37,157 --> 00:55:49,201
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the mayor spoke with him, but until we find out about enforcement regarding parking, we're gonna continue to have these issues and they're not unique to Oasis, not at all.

772
00:55:51,341 --> 00:55:51,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

773
00:55:51,962 --> 00:55:52,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

774
00:55:52,702 --> 00:55:53,302
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion.

775
00:55:55,768 --> 00:55:58,209
[SPEAKER_05]: As severed and as amended.

776
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the severed piece was for the signs.

777
00:56:04,291 --> 00:56:07,052
[SPEAKER_05]: The erection of temporary signs.

778
00:56:07,552 --> 00:56:08,452
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

779
00:56:09,772 --> 00:56:10,713
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

780
00:56:11,613 --> 00:56:14,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Mark Councilor Knight as opposed.

781
00:56:15,054 --> 00:56:15,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

782
00:56:17,075 --> 00:56:19,516
[SPEAKER_05]: On the main motion as amended, all those in favor?

783
00:56:21,536 --> 00:56:24,057
[SPEAKER_05]: A roll call vote has been requested for the main motion.

784
00:56:24,602 --> 00:56:27,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

785
00:56:28,043 --> 00:56:28,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello?

786
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:29,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

787
00:56:30,043 --> 00:56:30,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco?

788
00:56:30,883 --> 00:56:30,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

789
00:56:31,644 --> 00:56:32,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight?

790
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:32,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

791
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Lowell-Kern?

792
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:34,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

793
00:56:35,104 --> 00:56:35,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Marks?

794
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:36,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

795
00:56:36,865 --> 00:56:37,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

796
00:56:38,905 --> 00:56:39,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Absent.

797
00:56:40,426 --> 00:56:41,106
[SPEAKER_02]: President Dello Russo?

798
00:56:41,486 --> 00:56:41,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

799
00:56:41,926 --> 00:56:45,107
[SPEAKER_05]: With the vote of six in the affirmative, one absent.

800
00:56:45,127 --> 00:56:45,967
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion carries.

801
00:56:45,987 --> 00:56:47,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

802
00:56:47,287 --> 00:56:50,348
[SPEAKER_05]: 16-050 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

803
00:56:51,079 --> 00:57:02,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss and hold public hearings regarding moving the bus stop from 17 to 19 Main Street to Riverside Avenue and reversing the direction of River Street on a temporary basis.

804
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:05,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Paraviello.

805
00:57:05,545 --> 00:57:06,326
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

806
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:19,872
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something we discussed earlier in the evening in regards to moving the bus stop on a temporary basis to alleviate some of the traffic and confusion that comes at that 17, 19 area.

807
00:57:22,838 --> 00:57:30,142
[SPEAKER_14]: It was my suggestion and this council from last year's suggestion that we move the bus stop to Riverside Avenue on a temporary basis.

808
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:42,830
[SPEAKER_14]: There's already a cut out there versus moving it under the bridge, which would be, I think, a further hindrance to have people walk all that way under a dark underpass.

809
00:57:43,891 --> 00:57:49,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Whereas you can move it into a business district, it's lit, there's other buses that stop there.

810
00:57:50,998 --> 00:58:06,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that would be the least of the inconvenience to the T. And probably the only, the hottest part would be the buses that come down Salem Street that would normally stop there.

811
00:58:07,503 --> 00:58:09,844
[SPEAKER_14]: That poses a little bit of a problem.

812
00:58:10,424 --> 00:58:15,146
[SPEAKER_14]: And my only other suggestion would be to let them turn onto River Street.

813
00:58:16,546 --> 00:58:18,287
[SPEAKER_14]: And there is a natural cut out there.

814
00:58:18,852 --> 00:58:22,856
[SPEAKER_14]: And put the parking that's on that side to the other side of the street, Mr. President.

815
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,300
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, so they can just turn and make the loop and continue on.

816
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,342
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know what the process is.

817
00:58:28,362 --> 00:58:33,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we need to hold a public hearing or is this something that we do on our own?

818
00:58:34,108 --> 00:58:39,253
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe when we had a rather incoherent presentation on this a year or two ago.

819
00:58:39,872 --> 00:58:58,365
[SPEAKER_05]: and the lead up to the construction process of the Craddock Bridge, we were reminded finally and quite clearly from representatives from the MBTA that any change in route of a bus may only be approved by the MBTA.

820
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:07,372
[SPEAKER_05]: And my consultation with the city solicitor, he pointed out that in fact, the council does have the power to move a bus stop

821
00:59:07,817 --> 00:59:16,378
[SPEAKER_05]: But that process must be done or ought to be done or should be done under the consultation of the Traffic Commission.

822
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:24,760
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can refer this matter to the Traffic Commission for the next meeting, I'd be happy to attend that meeting, Mr. President.

823
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:25,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

824
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:30,161
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello that, oh, I'm sorry, Madam Vice President.

825
00:59:30,961 --> 00:59:32,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

826
00:59:32,521 --> 00:59:36,622
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do think this needs a discussion, but I also want to just make sure we get

827
00:59:38,134 --> 00:59:39,515
[SPEAKER_12]: Diane McLeod involved.

828
00:59:39,935 --> 00:59:49,258
[SPEAKER_12]: I've received two or three emails from her within the last year or so with regards to her objection to moving the sidewalk.

829
00:59:49,298 --> 00:59:52,619
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just think maybe a discussion needs to be had, which includes her.

830
00:59:52,859 --> 00:59:54,680
[SPEAKER_12]: So I agree with your public hearing.

831
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:02,063
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe, you know, there's so many different things that need to be done in that area with construction, which is why we met with MassDOT today at 530.

832
01:00:03,705 --> 01:00:12,329
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think she needs to come to the table because she has outwardly spoken out as we had somebody on that commission as well before us at 5.30.

833
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,951
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to include her.

834
01:00:16,031 --> 01:00:20,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't you send it to the Transportation Committee of the Council instead of there?

835
01:00:20,693 --> 01:00:23,635
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, if that's your suggestion, Mr. President.

836
01:00:24,255 --> 01:00:30,338
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we're not going to send it to the Traffic Commission, but we're going to send that to the Committee on Traffic.

837
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:32,419
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be Mr. Scarpelli's commission?

838
01:00:32,823 --> 01:00:33,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Chairman Scarpelli.

839
01:00:34,104 --> 01:00:36,965
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are going to send it to the traffic commission also, correct?

840
01:00:37,525 --> 01:00:42,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Why don't we maybe let them send it or invite the traffic commission to be part of that?

841
01:00:42,447 --> 01:00:51,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, because we'll miss the meeting if we, if we, uh, cause they meet at the end of the month and, um, then we'll send it to both.

842
01:00:51,791 --> 01:00:52,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

843
01:00:52,171 --> 01:00:52,791
[SPEAKER_14]: You do both.

844
01:00:53,891 --> 01:00:54,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

845
01:00:55,952 --> 01:00:57,653
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, ma'am.

846
01:00:57,693 --> 01:00:58,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

847
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Please state your name and address for the record.

848
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:03,041
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi there, Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

849
01:01:04,141 --> 01:01:16,405
[SPEAKER_11]: I am the chair of the Medford Disability Commission and I have noticed that a number of things have come up that are relevant to the Disability Commission and that might be worth talking about.

850
01:01:16,925 --> 01:01:20,486
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to invite any and all of you to come to our

851
01:01:21,786 --> 01:01:22,526
[SPEAKER_11]: to our meetings.

852
01:01:23,987 --> 01:01:31,110
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have questions for us, obviously we only meet so often, so if you've got something that's really time-sensitive, of course you want to talk to Diane about it.

853
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:41,074
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just want to let you know that we do meet on the fourth Wednesday of the month, generally, from 5.30 to 7 o'clock.

854
01:01:41,834 --> 01:01:43,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Our next meeting is what?

855
01:01:49,550 --> 01:02:02,180
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, so I'm gonna be on a boat then, so I don't actually remember when it is, but it's February 24th, and you are more than welcome, and of course, we'll be meeting in March as well.

856
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:10,387
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you've got questions, and we also are happy to put any of these topics on our agenda, we just need sufficient notice.

857
01:02:10,827 --> 01:02:18,754
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you'd like to come in and talk in general about bus stops and what would be necessary to move bus stops,

858
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:24,863
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, what it's, what navigating the sidewalks in particular areas is like, that sort of thing.

859
01:02:25,263 --> 01:02:28,806
[SPEAKER_11]: We would actually really love to have a dialogue about that, so please come join us.

860
01:02:29,046 --> 01:02:29,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

861
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:32,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

862
01:02:32,608 --> 01:02:37,212
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor?

863
01:02:38,172 --> 01:02:38,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

864
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:42,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

865
01:02:42,255 --> 01:02:46,218
[SPEAKER_05]: 16-051, offered 50 motions already in this year.

866
01:02:46,718 --> 01:02:49,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Medford

867
01:02:49,608 --> 01:02:56,850
[SPEAKER_05]: vocational technical high school, explore offering evening courses to local residents for advanced manufacturing training.

868
01:02:57,370 --> 01:03:07,534
[SPEAKER_05]: There is an increased demand for skilled workers to fill these high-paying jobs where we already have the vocational school as a resource to prepare area residents.

869
01:03:07,594 --> 01:03:08,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

870
01:03:09,074 --> 01:03:10,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

871
01:03:10,235 --> 01:03:17,677
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to start by thanking Andrew Castagnetti, who brought this issue to my attention as a

872
01:03:18,423 --> 01:03:21,664
[SPEAKER_10]: former graduate of the Medford Vocational School.

873
01:03:23,264 --> 01:03:36,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm always looking for ways to improving upon our vocational education within our community and also by also bringing in other people to take advantage of the vocational school.

874
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:39,888
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is a unique opportunity, Mr. President.

875
01:03:40,968 --> 01:03:43,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Right now, the advanced manufacturing sector

876
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:51,015
[SPEAKER_10]: And the Commonwealth has, I guess, a boom in jobs and the need to fill these jobs.

877
01:03:51,776 --> 01:03:57,680
[SPEAKER_10]: The average salary is about $75,000 for someone in this particular field.

878
01:03:58,441 --> 01:04:04,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And the city of Somerville just recently put together a course that they're offering.

879
01:04:04,846 --> 01:04:07,168
[SPEAKER_10]: They have two courses, one during the day and one at night.

880
01:04:08,689 --> 01:04:11,471
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're offering local residents over the age of 18 to

881
01:04:14,373 --> 01:04:16,873
[SPEAKER_10]: and take courses in the advanced manufacturing training.

882
01:04:17,434 --> 01:04:24,595
[SPEAKER_10]: And this opens up a whole new networking for young adults that are 18, 19.

883
01:04:24,995 --> 01:04:26,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they didn't end up going to college.

884
01:04:27,035 --> 01:04:28,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Not everyone goes to college.

885
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:35,197
[SPEAKER_10]: They're stuck in a low-paid job, and they're looking for advancement, a way to create a career.

886
01:04:35,757 --> 01:04:43,638
[SPEAKER_10]: And this really, I think, would be a win-win, not only to promote our vocational school, but also to allow area residents to attend courses

887
01:04:44,058 --> 01:04:46,520
[SPEAKER_10]: at a local school that's accessible, Mr. President.

888
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,702
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it would be a win-win for our residents.

889
01:04:50,183 --> 01:05:10,898
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would just respectfully ask that the new director of the vocational school, who's doing yeoman's work in improving vocational education at the high school, and also bringing in new state-of-the-art technology equipment and courses at the vocational school, look into, Mr. President,

890
01:05:11,682 --> 01:05:33,127
[SPEAKER_10]: the offering of this advanced manufacturing training to see if we have, first of all, the capability of doing it, and secondly, if we can offer courses to local residents that may have an interest in potentially looking at jobs in the 75 to 80 grand range for this particular trade, Mr. President.

891
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:37,628
[SPEAKER_10]: So, again, I want to thank Mr. Castagnetti for bringing this to my attention.

892
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:41,169
[SPEAKER_10]: and ask that this be moved for approval, Mr. President.

893
01:05:41,209 --> 01:05:44,850
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Marks, all those in favor?

894
01:05:45,511 --> 01:05:47,631
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

895
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:48,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

896
01:05:48,752 --> 01:05:50,652
[SPEAKER_05]: 16-052 offered by Vice President Hungo Kern.

897
01:05:51,153 --> 01:06:06,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the administration update the Medford City Council and keep us appraised of what changes have and will be made with regards to plans and procedures of the Medford Police Department and Medford Fire Department, such as

898
01:06:07,261 --> 01:06:11,924
[SPEAKER_05]: implementation of interdepartmental email for the fire department.

899
01:06:12,845 --> 01:06:13,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Vice President.

900
01:06:13,906 --> 01:06:15,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

901
01:06:15,487 --> 01:06:16,607
[SPEAKER_12]: I put this on the agenda.

902
01:06:16,928 --> 01:06:25,213
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I've had requests for updates on changes, resolutions on the agenda for the last three or four weeks.

903
01:06:26,054 --> 01:06:34,860
[SPEAKER_12]: And some things obviously have shown my frustration with regards to, but I think people are ready for change.

904
01:06:36,047 --> 01:06:44,034
[SPEAKER_12]: in a number of ways and a little anxious to get those changes and see what's gonna happen and find out what's gonna happen when.

905
01:06:44,054 --> 01:06:53,802
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is just to piggyback with regards to last week, I brought up enforcement and how is it gonna change, how is it gonna increase and better our community.

906
01:06:54,462 --> 01:07:05,051
[SPEAKER_12]: With regards to the Medford Police Department, Medford Fire Department, there have been resolves throughout the last many years with regards to changes and updates, whether it be building-wise,

907
01:07:05,722 --> 01:07:09,703
[SPEAKER_12]: or inter-department issues that go on.

908
01:07:10,183 --> 01:07:21,925
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that I, as one Councilor, have asked for the fire department to have inter-departmental email for almost two years now, since I found out there was no such thing, and I think it's kind of archaic.

909
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:32,527
[SPEAKER_12]: We've also questioned, you know, the female locker rooms, which we issue, which we know is in arbitration, and, you know, now the females are getting gym passes.

910
01:07:33,128 --> 01:07:40,072
[SPEAKER_12]: We've gone in length with regards to the police department building and updates and the minor updates that were implemented.

911
01:07:40,292 --> 01:08:00,262
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'd like to know from our administration what additional updates may be taking place, what the plan is, how are we going to make changes in a positive way, where are we going to spend our money, what are we going to do, what type of push will there be towards different enforcement throughout

912
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:05,229
[SPEAKER_12]: the police department and, you know, how are those, you know, when are those changes going to take place?

913
01:08:05,249 --> 01:08:16,514
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's important, and I think it's important for us to be updated with regards to, you know, minor things that, you know, the administration may seem to think are minor.

914
01:08:16,534 --> 01:08:28,560
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the council should be apprised of it, and I hope that we can, you know, get a communication from the mayor's office with regards to changes that have already been addressed and discussed and changes that maybe

915
01:08:29,416 --> 01:08:43,745
[SPEAKER_12]: she would like to make in the future so that we can get an idea of how we're moving forward and hopefully get a better understanding of the positive changes that we know need to be made and hopefully will be made.

916
01:08:44,946 --> 01:08:45,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

917
01:08:45,366 --> 01:08:46,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

918
01:08:46,707 --> 01:08:55,112
[SPEAKER_05]: You might notice in your packets, we've gotten the swiftest responses to most resolutions than I can remember on my tenure on the council.

919
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:56,613
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

920
01:08:57,475 --> 01:09:02,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, Councilor Longo did speak a little bit about the female locker room at the police department.

921
01:09:02,838 --> 01:09:07,180
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my understanding that they're in the process right now of rectifying the situation.

922
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:21,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been brought to my attention that a certain area has been vacated by a certain department and they've been moved to the new DPW building and the administration is in the process of building out a female locker room for female officers, Mr. President.

923
01:09:21,887 --> 01:09:25,028
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to amend the paper and ask for an update on that item in particular.

924
01:09:25,688 --> 01:09:30,710
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo-Koehn as amended by Councilor Knight.

925
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:31,650
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

926
01:09:32,571 --> 01:09:33,391
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

927
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:35,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

928
01:09:35,152 --> 01:09:38,413
[SPEAKER_05]: 16-053 offered by Councilor Falco.

929
01:09:39,133 --> 01:09:47,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the Medford City Council receives a weekly agenda and an informational package each Friday to prepare for the weekly council meeting.

930
01:09:47,657 --> 01:09:53,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas each package contains various postings of upcoming public meetings throughout the city of Medford.

931
01:09:55,024 --> 01:10:05,793
[SPEAKER_05]: be it resolved that the city administration require all boards and commissions to post meeting notifications and agenda items on the Medford City website.

932
01:10:06,254 --> 01:10:07,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

933
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:08,315
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

934
01:10:08,455 --> 01:10:17,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, this, this resolution is about, uh, you know, government being open and more transparent to our residents in, and also just making government more accessible in general.

935
01:10:17,843 --> 01:10:22,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and I have to say when I first wrote this resolution last, uh, Thursday,

936
01:10:22,853 --> 01:10:24,234
[SPEAKER_09]: and sent it to the city clerk.

937
01:10:24,294 --> 01:10:29,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I did some research on the city website and I couldn't find any information on this.

938
01:10:29,378 --> 01:10:36,663
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's great, every week we receive, I don't know, at least 10 notices of open meetings and they're important.

939
01:10:36,883 --> 01:10:41,767
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the public should be encouraged to attend and be involved.

940
01:10:42,327 --> 01:10:49,593
[SPEAKER_09]: But last night as I was preparing for our meeting, I went back onto the city website and I noticed the city actually has a city calendar now.

941
01:10:50,073 --> 01:10:52,395
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually when it came online, I'm guessing,

942
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:57,622
[SPEAKER_09]: over maybe the past couple of days, but when I first wrote the resolution, it wasn't there.

943
01:10:58,503 --> 01:11:02,045
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but it's—I give the administration a lot of credit.

944
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:03,726
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's heading in the right direction.

945
01:11:04,267 --> 01:11:04,967
[SPEAKER_09]: It's nice.

946
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:05,888
[SPEAKER_09]: You click on the meetings.

947
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:06,869
[SPEAKER_09]: You get a link.

948
01:11:07,989 --> 01:11:12,973
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I didn't—what I noticed is not all meetings are posted.

949
01:11:13,053 --> 01:11:16,295
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's why my resolution is basically to require.

950
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:20,175
[SPEAKER_09]: that all of them, all of the, uh, boarding commission meetings be posted.

951
01:11:20,195 --> 01:11:22,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I think they should require an agenda.

952
01:11:22,757 --> 01:11:36,486
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I could, um, amend the resolution to require that the minutes be, uh, also posted, uh, once the meeting is, uh, has been completed, it's important that, you know, we involve our citizens and they, you know, have the right to go to a website, go to the city website.

953
01:11:36,546 --> 01:11:41,169
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they, they can see a list of meetings for the month, if they want to attend things, great.

954
01:11:41,249 --> 01:11:43,731
[SPEAKER_09]: If they don't, at least when they, or if they can't at least,

955
01:11:44,188 --> 01:11:48,972
[SPEAKER_09]: At the conclusion of the meeting, if the minutes are there, you know, they can actually see what happened during the meeting.

956
01:11:49,012 --> 01:11:49,932
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's important.

957
01:11:50,133 --> 01:11:57,398
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, if I could amend that to, um, if you can amend that to, uh, require the minutes as well, uh, that'd be great.

958
01:11:57,518 --> 01:12:01,201
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, I move for a motion of approval as amended council night.

959
01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:03,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, thank you very much, Mr. President.

960
01:12:03,363 --> 01:12:03,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

961
01:12:03,723 --> 01:12:05,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco for this resolution.

962
01:12:05,164 --> 01:12:06,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a great resolution.

963
01:12:07,321 --> 01:12:22,055
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to amend it, Mr. President, to request that the administration begin scheduling their board and commission meetings outside of normal business hours so those individuals that are working for a living have the opportunity to appear after their work day to participate.

964
01:12:22,956 --> 01:12:30,523
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd also ask that if and when possible, the meetings be televised or streamed.

965
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:42,116
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the twice amended motion, three times amended motion, twice by council night by council.

966
01:12:42,136 --> 01:12:51,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, while I'm on such a role, Mr. President, I have also filed a resolution under suspension of similar substance, asking that the three week look ahead.

967
01:12:52,725 --> 01:12:55,365
[SPEAKER_03]: schedule for the Craddock Bridge will be posted on the city's website as well.

968
01:12:55,446 --> 01:12:59,526
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to amend this paper to include that and I'll withdraw the paper under suspension.

969
01:12:59,706 --> 01:13:00,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.

970
01:13:00,266 --> 01:13:10,448
[SPEAKER_05]: So on that motion and second approval by Councilor Knight as amended of the resolution of Councilor Falco who made the first motion for approval.

971
01:13:10,868 --> 01:13:11,608
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

972
01:13:12,148 --> 01:13:12,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

973
01:13:12,748 --> 01:13:13,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Opposed?

974
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:17,889
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

975
01:13:17,989 --> 01:13:19,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

976
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:21,810
[SPEAKER_05]: 16-057 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

977
01:13:22,553 --> 01:13:41,103
[SPEAKER_05]: be resolved that the Medford City Council invite Rosemary Waltos, a library building specialist from the Massachusetts Libraries Board of Commissioners, along with members of our state delegation to a committee of the whole, to discuss funding opportunities for our public library, which is in need of major repairs and replacements.

978
01:13:41,563 --> 01:13:42,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

979
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:43,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

980
01:13:43,824 --> 01:13:52,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, it was only a few weeks ago that Barbara Kaye was here from the library, complaining how the roof was leaking and disrepair.

981
01:13:52,827 --> 01:14:00,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, two weeks ago, I attended for the fourth time the convention at Sheridan for the city officials.

982
01:14:01,272 --> 01:14:09,556
[SPEAKER_14]: And for the fourth year in a row, I've asked them if Medford, the library commission, if Medford has applied for any money.

983
01:14:10,317 --> 01:14:15,379
[SPEAKER_14]: And finally this year, she said that some talks were in discussion.

984
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:18,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it took us years to get this.

985
01:14:18,461 --> 01:14:20,122
[SPEAKER_14]: But what I want to point out is,

986
01:14:21,372 --> 01:14:31,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Over the last couple of years, Mr. President, over 100 libraries have been either built, reconstructed, under construction, or in the planning stage.

987
01:14:32,274 --> 01:14:41,455
[SPEAKER_14]: And just in our area, you've got Malden, Melrose, Arlington, Winchester, Cambridge, Everett, Woburn, Wakefield, Burlington, Lexington, Walton.

988
01:14:41,856 --> 01:14:48,337
[SPEAKER_14]: These are all cities and towns, Mr. President, that have taken advantage of the money from the Library Building Commission.

989
01:14:48,997 --> 01:14:50,577
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's time that

990
01:14:51,156 --> 01:14:52,817
[SPEAKER_14]: City of Medford get a chair.

991
01:14:54,317 --> 01:14:55,598
[SPEAKER_14]: She says there's money available.

992
01:14:56,878 --> 01:14:58,039
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke to her again today.

993
01:14:58,499 --> 01:15:05,942
[SPEAKER_14]: She's more than willing to come down to the city to talk with the librarian, the trustees, and anybody we want to talk to.

994
01:15:06,362 --> 01:15:15,966
[SPEAKER_14]: But she's willing to help us out, to do whatever's necessary to get the process started, to get us some funding, to get the library either rebuilt or reconstructed.

995
01:15:16,327 --> 01:15:19,528
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would ask that this

996
01:15:20,172 --> 01:15:22,514
[SPEAKER_14]: motion be sent to the mayor for her immediate action.

997
01:15:23,034 --> 01:15:32,321
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mr. President, while we're talking in the library, would it be possible that we can get a report back if the roof was ever repaired from a few weeks ago?

998
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:35,303
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll take that as an amendment to your resolution as well.

999
01:15:35,523 --> 01:15:35,763
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1000
01:15:36,083 --> 01:15:43,368
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, over 100 cities and towns, Mr. President, have taken advantage of funding for their libraries.

1001
01:15:44,009 --> 01:15:47,892
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the last four years that I've been on this council, we have not gotten $1.

1002
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:49,713
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's a shame.

1003
01:15:50,567 --> 01:15:52,487
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for this important measure, Councilor.

1004
01:15:52,867 --> 01:15:59,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for your participation on behalf of this body with the Mass Municipal Association.

1005
01:15:59,609 --> 01:16:01,329
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been a wealth of information for all of us.

1006
01:16:01,869 --> 01:16:05,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

1007
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:05,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1008
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:06,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President DeLaRusso.

1009
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:11,091
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for reaching out to the Commissioner.

1010
01:16:11,451 --> 01:16:13,031
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a huge help.

1011
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:16,492
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that the library needs a rehab.

1012
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,152
[SPEAKER_12]: It needs a lot of work.

1013
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:26,140
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been speaking about whether it be the bathrooms or the roof leaking, years and years, or underfunding the library.

1014
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:33,085
[SPEAKER_12]: So many people are interested to see this library updated, and I really hope it comes to fruition.

1015
01:16:33,605 --> 01:16:46,735
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that when I proposed that we hire a grant writer years back, one of my main reasons for it was because I read an article with regards to the grants that are out there for libraries in Massachusetts.

1016
01:16:47,230 --> 01:17:01,176
[SPEAKER_12]: And for us not to be taking part in trying to get these grants and trying to get state money, federal money to update our library, I think we're shortchanging something that could be so wonderful.

1017
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:06,338
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure about the roof, but I, too, would like to get an update on that.

1018
01:17:06,538 --> 01:17:10,740
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to thank you again, Councilor Caraviello, for reaching out to the board member.

1019
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:13,741
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully we can sit down and try to get some ideas.

1020
01:17:14,466 --> 01:17:22,468
[SPEAKER_12]: get the administration moving on some grants so that we can, whether we have to fund some ourself or not, I think we need to do it either way.

1021
01:17:23,968 --> 01:17:24,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1022
01:17:24,648 --> 01:17:28,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam Vice President, Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

1023
01:17:28,429 --> 01:17:29,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1024
01:17:29,509 --> 01:17:32,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up tonight.

1025
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:34,290
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a very important resolution.

1026
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:41,872
[SPEAKER_09]: The library is a very important asset to our community and I support the resolution completely.

1027
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:55,850
[SPEAKER_09]: The question I had with regarding the roof is, um, just because, uh, you caught some Kyriel brought it up is, uh, he had asked if, um, if it's been fixed, I'd like to know not whether or not it was fixed, but what's the plan.

1028
01:17:55,911 --> 01:17:58,972
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, as far as if it's not been fixed, what is the plan for the roof?

1029
01:17:59,132 --> 01:18:05,736
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, with regard to, I mean, for example, I was in the library, uh, I think about two weeks ago, I went to a, they had a trivia night.

1030
01:18:05,756 --> 01:18:07,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was a friends in Medford public library.

1031
01:18:08,037 --> 01:18:08,817
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was a great event.

1032
01:18:09,277 --> 01:18:10,098
[SPEAKER_09]: They raised a lot of money.

1033
01:18:10,718 --> 01:18:11,598
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was nice.

1034
01:18:11,618 --> 01:18:13,899
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the first time they had an event like that in the library.

1035
01:18:13,919 --> 01:18:14,699
[SPEAKER_09]: It was after hours.

1036
01:18:15,319 --> 01:18:16,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And open to the public.

1037
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:19,400
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're sitting there having a great time.

1038
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:25,321
[SPEAKER_09]: But as you look around, you see, you know, ceiling tiles that are not there, barrels collecting water.

1039
01:18:26,062 --> 01:18:29,342
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we're still only maybe halfway through winter.

1040
01:18:29,502 --> 01:18:35,464
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need to find out exactly, if we could find out exactly from the administration, what is the plan with regard to the roof?

1041
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:45,553
[SPEAKER_05]: be it further resolved by Councilor Falco that, uh, or amended by Councilor Falco to get a answer from the administration with a long range plan for dealing with the roof.

1042
01:18:46,573 --> 01:18:46,893
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1043
01:18:47,053 --> 01:18:47,433
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1044
01:18:48,033 --> 01:18:50,373
[SPEAKER_05]: And the chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1045
01:18:51,314 --> 01:18:52,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1046
01:18:52,054 --> 01:18:53,474
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank Councilor Caravielloli.

1047
01:18:53,494 --> 01:19:00,655
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been a real advocate for the public library and the children of this community when it comes to the public library.

1048
01:19:00,675 --> 01:19:02,955
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to thank him for his action on this.

1049
01:19:03,576 --> 01:19:05,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, the reason why we didn't receive funding for the past,

1050
01:19:06,337 --> 01:19:18,889
[SPEAKER_10]: four years was that the city of method during budgetary discussions didn't meet the state mandated threshold that's required for funding of a public library.

1051
01:19:19,269 --> 01:19:22,953
[SPEAKER_10]: So we therefore were ineligible to participate

1052
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:24,571
[SPEAKER_10]: in any state grants.

1053
01:19:25,151 --> 01:19:41,802
[SPEAKER_10]: And we also, anyone that uses their library card, we lost membership in surrounding communities, the ability to go to another library in the network, the Minuteman network, and use their library because of our lack of funding our library.

1054
01:19:42,422 --> 01:19:45,224
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm hoping to see that change, Mr. President.

1055
01:19:46,245 --> 01:19:52,369
[SPEAKER_10]: I also just want to touch upon the roof, because the report that we received

1056
01:19:53,138 --> 01:20:07,926
[SPEAKER_10]: had a various range from a couple of thousand dollars on a very temporary fix to I believe it was $125,000 or $130,000 for major roof repair and replacement throughout the entire library.

1057
01:20:08,306 --> 01:20:13,049
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's only incumbent upon the administration to at least update the council

1058
01:20:13,513 --> 01:20:24,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if the option three, which is I believe 130, 140,000 of repair is necessary, we're probably going to be looking for a bond for the roof.

1059
01:20:24,582 --> 01:20:26,384
[SPEAKER_10]: And that would be approval by this council.

1060
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:34,871
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's important that the city administration at least give us a direction on what the plans are.

1061
01:20:35,511 --> 01:20:39,715
[SPEAKER_10]: And that roof has not been touched in 25 years.

1062
01:20:40,215 --> 01:20:42,077
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the last time that roof was replaced.

1063
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:54,623
[SPEAKER_10]: And much of the pointing of the bricks, not only the roof, but the pointing around the bricks are accepting water, standing water from the roof itself, some of the flashing.

1064
01:20:54,943 --> 01:20:58,285
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a lot of work that needs to be done on that roof, Mr. President.

1065
01:20:58,665 --> 01:21:09,950
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask that I thank Councilor Falco and Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing that up, and Councilor Caraviello about the roof repair, Mr. President, that we get

1066
01:21:12,557 --> 01:21:13,738
[SPEAKER_10]: an immediate response on that.

1067
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:14,638
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

1068
01:21:15,258 --> 01:21:15,958
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

1069
01:21:15,998 --> 01:21:32,704
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, this is the reason if we can get this into the mayor's hands quickly and we can act on it quickly, rather than us going off for a bond, let's see what the state can do for us rather than burden our city taxpayers.

1070
01:21:33,524 --> 01:21:33,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

1071
01:21:34,785 --> 01:21:35,105
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1072
01:21:35,665 --> 01:21:38,606
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, as amended.

1073
01:21:38,626 --> 01:21:39,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

1074
01:21:40,127 --> 01:21:41,087
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Councilor Marks.

1075
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:56,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Just if I could, I'm under the impression that the new administration was putting on a position that was in the mayor's office that was also a liaison between the mayor's office and the council.

1076
01:21:58,061 --> 01:22:03,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I'm not mistaken, that position, I haven't seen anyone.

1077
01:22:03,686 --> 01:22:06,608
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't had any outreach like, hey, look at me.

1078
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:12,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm the new person that's going to be taking your request back and getting a quicker response to the mayor and

1079
01:22:12,819 --> 01:22:29,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't seen that yet, so maybe, Mr. President, maybe not to a resolution, but maybe if you could find out what the situation is with the liaison to the council, with the mayor, because that seemed to be a big point during the election.

1080
01:22:31,793 --> 01:22:32,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1081
01:22:32,574 --> 01:22:34,375
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

1082
01:22:34,795 --> 01:22:34,935
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

1083
01:22:35,296 --> 01:22:35,936
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1084
01:22:37,057 --> 01:22:37,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

1085
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:41,081
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple things.

1086
01:22:42,402 --> 01:22:42,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1087
01:22:45,644 --> 01:22:46,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry?

1088
01:22:46,705 --> 01:22:47,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Rules to talk about an issue.

1089
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:49,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1090
01:22:50,587 --> 01:23:00,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Next week, six o'clock, Committee of the Whole to address our goals as councillors.

1091
01:23:04,255 --> 01:23:05,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Committee of the Whole met this evening.

1092
01:23:06,996 --> 01:23:15,161
[SPEAKER_05]: at 5.30 and upon resolution by Councilor Marks, it was reported favorably out of committee.

1093
01:23:17,022 --> 01:23:17,902
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a long meeting.

1094
01:23:18,623 --> 01:23:32,531
[SPEAKER_05]: We addressed the issue of the Craddock Bridge construction, its impact on life in general in the neighborhood, its specific impact upon business there, pedestrian safety, traffic,

1095
01:23:33,394 --> 01:23:37,517
[SPEAKER_05]: congestion, buses, transportation in general.

1096
01:23:39,218 --> 01:23:40,299
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a good session.

1097
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:48,905
[SPEAKER_05]: We had representatives from Massachusetts Department of Transportation, project manager for the program.

1098
01:23:49,465 --> 01:23:52,527
[SPEAKER_05]: We had representatives from Zoppo Construction.

1099
01:23:53,468 --> 01:24:00,333
[SPEAKER_05]: The project manager was there for the construction progress, which I, on the sense of, on the part of DOT.

1100
01:24:01,430 --> 01:24:16,475
[SPEAKER_05]: We had department heads, Lauren DiLorenzo, Chief Sacco, Engineer Koudelakis, the acting commissioner of the DPW, Brian Cairns, and I might be missing some, as well as all six councillors were present.

1101
01:24:17,295 --> 01:24:20,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven citizens had the opportunity to speak and express their concerns.

1102
01:24:21,617 --> 01:24:24,378
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very grateful.

1103
01:24:24,478 --> 01:24:25,458
[SPEAKER_05]: How many councillors were there?

1104
01:24:25,518 --> 01:24:25,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven.

1105
01:24:26,124 --> 01:24:28,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilors and seven citizens spoke.

1106
01:24:28,446 --> 01:24:28,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there.

1107
01:24:28,926 --> 01:24:31,388
[SPEAKER_05]: I sat at the head of the table.

1108
01:24:31,488 --> 01:24:31,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1109
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:40,915
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the clerk is going to read off, if he would, the committee report.

1110
01:24:41,896 --> 01:24:44,438
[SPEAKER_02]: You had some recommendations from the committee.

1111
01:24:45,799 --> 01:24:50,623
[SPEAKER_02]: One was to do an ADA audit of the project.

1112
01:24:56,688 --> 01:25:04,991
[SPEAKER_02]: And the administration to designate a contact person with the project.

1113
01:25:08,273 --> 01:25:19,057
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have an update, and to have updates from MassDOT in a week or two on the issues that were discussed during the meeting.

1114
01:25:20,098 --> 01:25:20,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

1115
01:25:21,575 --> 01:25:31,001
[SPEAKER_12]: And was that, did that get your, uh, Madam Vice President had those, uh, just, if we could just make clear that the contact person be somebody from, from city hall.

1116
01:25:32,142 --> 01:25:33,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, just make that clear.

1117
01:25:33,643 --> 01:25:37,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe one of the three that have already been dealing with mass dot as of recent.

1118
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:42,889
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1119
01:25:43,829 --> 01:25:49,653
[SPEAKER_12]: And that we, and that we do get it, sorry that we do get an update within, you know, the next week or two with regards to,

1120
01:25:50,881 --> 01:25:54,503
[SPEAKER_12]: the many issues we discussed and recommendations and requests.

1121
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:55,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1122
01:25:55,984 --> 01:26:00,947
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to then get a report back and then reconvene for an update.

1123
01:26:01,627 --> 01:26:05,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion president, Oh, uh, council Marks, if you would please.

1124
01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:05,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1125
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:06,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1126
01:26:07,110 --> 01:26:09,192
[SPEAKER_10]: And I agree with all my colleagues.

1127
01:26:09,232 --> 01:26:17,076
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we all felt it was necessary to have a contact person, a clerk of the work, whatever you want to call them, uh, to be responsible.

1128
01:26:17,696 --> 01:26:18,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, you know,

1129
01:26:19,325 --> 01:26:24,988
[SPEAKER_10]: At one point in this city, we had a person by the name of Jack Buckley, who was a project manager.

1130
01:26:25,988 --> 01:26:36,173
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jack Buckley was responsible for the oversight of the building of the new schools, which was probably the largest endeavor in this city's history.

1131
01:26:36,533 --> 01:26:40,155
[SPEAKER_10]: He was responsible for the refurbishing of the fire stations.

1132
01:26:40,535 --> 01:26:43,197
[SPEAKER_10]: He was responsible for the

1133
01:26:44,634 --> 01:26:48,477
[SPEAKER_10]: oversight of a number of large projects happening in the community.

1134
01:26:49,177 --> 01:26:50,958
[SPEAKER_10]: And he retired recently.

1135
01:26:51,559 --> 01:26:56,482
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think one thing that's lacking in this community, Mr. President, is that type of oversight.

1136
01:26:56,902 --> 01:27:10,132
[SPEAKER_10]: Jack had great expertise on building trades, how to deal with manufacturers, how to make sure that these particular companies were compliant with contract.

1137
01:27:10,232 --> 01:27:13,574
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, he had a great depth of knowledge.

1138
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:24,116
[SPEAKER_10]: And you could rest assured if you asked him a question on anything regarding construction or what's taking place, timeframes, he was always there to answer the question.

1139
01:27:24,677 --> 01:27:36,066
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really believe someone in that capacity is needed, Mr. President, because what we heard tonight from the administration was the question was asked, who's the point person on this project?

1140
01:27:36,086 --> 01:27:38,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if it was, I think it was Councilor Knight that asked that.

1141
01:27:38,883 --> 01:27:42,386
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were told, well, Lawrence said, I can answer questions.

1142
01:27:43,047 --> 01:27:46,710
[SPEAKER_10]: The city engineer, Cassandra Koudelaitis, said I can answer questions.

1143
01:27:47,230 --> 01:27:49,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you can send them to Paul Mokey.

1144
01:27:49,672 --> 01:27:50,953
[SPEAKER_10]: He may be able to answer questions.

1145
01:27:52,134 --> 01:28:02,242
[SPEAKER_10]: I think when we get back to accountability, get back to having a central depository where you know who to call, I think it's very important, Mr. President.

1146
01:28:02,322 --> 01:28:06,486
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would just like to mention that to the city administration,

1147
01:28:07,354 --> 01:28:11,416
[SPEAKER_10]: The project manager was there for a number of years for a reason, and it was successful.

1148
01:28:11,456 --> 01:28:29,406
[SPEAKER_10]: In my opinion, it was very successful, maybe based on the person that we had in that position, but it was a successful position in moving projects forward and alerting residents on the ongoings of what's happening in the community, and I do want to point

1149
01:28:29,857 --> 01:28:30,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Point that out, Mr. President.

1150
01:28:31,158 --> 01:28:31,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilman.

1151
01:28:31,918 --> 01:28:42,425
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to point out that that project in person was for projects that were funded by the city as part of bonding processes and all of that.

1152
01:28:42,765 --> 01:28:49,989
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that this was a state project that we're dealing with and not a municipal one.

1153
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:55,533
[SPEAKER_10]: But Mr. President, with all due respect, it's on a Medford road.

1154
01:28:56,013 --> 01:28:57,354
[SPEAKER_10]: It's affecting Medford business.

1155
01:28:57,694 --> 01:28:59,075
[SPEAKER_10]: It's affecting Medford pedestrians.

1156
01:28:59,385 --> 01:29:00,707
[SPEAKER_10]: It's affecting method traffic.

1157
01:29:01,087 --> 01:29:09,316
[SPEAKER_10]: For us not to have a clerk of the work or a project manager, whether it's state or city, makes no sense.

1158
01:29:10,017 --> 01:29:11,599
[SPEAKER_10]: It has no bearing at all.

1159
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:13,481
[SPEAKER_10]: The project is a method project.

1160
01:29:13,881 --> 01:29:15,343
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in no disagreement with you.

1161
01:29:15,843 --> 01:29:19,748
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, but I think you were trying to point out that that was only for city projects.

1162
01:29:20,275 --> 01:29:24,958
[SPEAKER_10]: And even with the FAST-14 project, the bridge repair, that was a state project.

1163
01:29:24,998 --> 01:29:31,482
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the largest bridge repair in this state's history that went through this city, the heart of this city.

1164
01:29:31,902 --> 01:29:36,305
[SPEAKER_10]: And at the time, we had someone on board, and that was Jack Buckley, Mr. President.

1165
01:29:36,565 --> 01:29:44,450
[SPEAKER_10]: We had someone on board that was there to make sure that the I's were dotted and the T's were crossed and that all contractual language was adhered to.

1166
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:50,032
[SPEAKER_10]: and to make sure that resident, business owner, and everyone's questions were addressed.

1167
01:29:50,732 --> 01:29:52,613
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I would disagree with you.

1168
01:29:52,653 --> 01:30:06,278
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that position was for any project in the community, whether it was bonded by our city or not, to ensure that the rules and regulations and that this city is heard when issues need to be addressed, Mr. President.

1169
01:30:06,298 --> 01:30:07,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. McNerney.

1170
01:30:08,299 --> 01:30:09,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1171
01:30:09,659 --> 01:30:13,781
[SPEAKER_03]: And Councilor Marks, I think everything you said is 100 percent accurate.

1172
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:22,341
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely a need for someone to be the so-called clerk of the work, someone that has a set of eyes on these construction projects that are going on in our community.

1173
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:33,869
[SPEAKER_03]: As these private contractors come in and these private utility companies come in and tear up our streets and then say they'll be back in a year to fix it, we need to make sure that there's someone there saying, hey, remember nine months ago when you said you were going to be back?

1174
01:30:34,169 --> 01:30:35,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the nine months are up.

1175
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:37,251
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to start digging in the ground and fixing the street.

1176
01:30:38,367 --> 01:30:46,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I really support the position of the office of the project manager and the position of a project manager or the so-called clerk of the works, Mr. President, for the simple reason that it provides accountability.

1177
01:30:47,531 --> 01:30:55,394
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know if someone's not doing the job because we can see the ramifications and the aftereffects when the ground gets opened up and gets put back together.

1178
01:30:55,414 --> 01:30:56,094
[SPEAKER_03]: We know who to go to.

1179
01:30:56,134 --> 01:30:56,914
[SPEAKER_03]: We know who to talk to.

1180
01:30:57,654 --> 01:31:06,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I certainly echo Councilor Mack's sentiments and statement when he says that he'd like to see a project manager rehired here at the city level.

1181
01:31:08,475 --> 01:31:10,396
[SPEAKER_03]: was an unbelievable asset to this community.

1182
01:31:10,796 --> 01:31:16,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not just saying that because his backyard is right around the corner from my parents' backyard.

1183
01:31:16,559 --> 01:31:19,280
[SPEAKER_03]: He did a great job, and he did great work.

1184
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:33,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go down the list and you look at the projects that he oversaw, whether it was the pool or the science labs or the DPW yard or the renovations at the firehouse, he certainly was someone that made sure that we got our bang for our buck, Mr. President.

1185
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:35,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we need someone in that capacity

1186
01:31:36,053 --> 01:31:36,594
[SPEAKER_03]: to continue.

1187
01:31:36,654 --> 01:31:40,576
[SPEAKER_03]: So I certainly support Councilor Mark's position wholeheartedly and I move for approval on the paper.

1188
01:31:40,596 --> 01:31:45,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion for the approval of the committee report by Councilor Marks.

1189
01:31:49,183 --> 01:31:49,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1190
01:31:50,183 --> 01:31:50,944
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1191
01:31:50,964 --> 01:31:52,585
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1192
01:31:53,826 --> 01:31:55,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

1193
01:31:56,308 --> 01:31:59,510
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Falco for suspension of the rules.

1194
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:00,651
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1195
01:32:01,311 --> 01:32:02,032
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1196
01:32:02,912 --> 01:32:03,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

1197
01:32:04,473 --> 01:32:05,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Falco.

1198
01:32:05,398 --> 01:32:06,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1199
01:32:07,099 --> 01:32:15,064
[SPEAKER_09]: I received a phone call Saturday afternoon about 4.30 from Father Ed, Ed Doughty from St.

1200
01:32:15,104 --> 01:32:16,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe's, Joseph's.

1201
01:32:16,685 --> 01:32:22,788
[SPEAKER_09]: And he called to tell me that as he was welcoming parishioners into the 4 o'clock mass at St.

1202
01:32:22,828 --> 01:32:26,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe's, parishioners were getting tickets from Republic Parking.

1203
01:32:27,351 --> 01:32:32,174
[SPEAKER_09]: And I find this incredibly frustrating that after one year, I mean, that is not

1204
01:32:32,503 --> 01:32:38,286
[SPEAKER_09]: that's not part of the contract, and they shouldn't be ticketing during mass from what I know of the contract.

1205
01:32:38,846 --> 01:32:45,109
[SPEAKER_09]: And I find it very frustrating that after one year, they're still ticketing people when they shouldn't.

1206
01:32:46,109 --> 01:32:49,371
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like some sort of response back from Republic Parking.

1207
01:32:49,411 --> 01:32:52,492
[SPEAKER_09]: If we could get something in writing as to why this happened.

1208
01:32:53,253 --> 01:33:00,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Father Ed did go on to tell me that he actually approached the person writing the tickets and told them, you know, you shouldn't be doing this.

1209
01:33:00,876 --> 01:33:02,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And at no point in the time,

1210
01:33:03,074 --> 01:33:03,915
[SPEAKER_09]: did the person stop?

1211
01:33:03,935 --> 01:33:05,156
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't even call the office.

1212
01:33:05,296 --> 01:33:08,358
[SPEAKER_09]: You figured they would call the office and check just to get some clarification.

1213
01:33:08,999 --> 01:33:13,202
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could get some sort of a response from Republic Parking to find out why it happened.

1214
01:33:13,743 --> 01:33:26,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if it's a case, if it's a new employee or not, employee or not, but in a case like that, there should be some sort of backup for their employees to call the office to find out, you know, whether or not they're doing the right thing or following policy.

1215
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:30,677
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could get some sort of response from Republic Parking, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1216
01:33:31,174 --> 01:33:31,474
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1217
01:33:31,594 --> 01:33:32,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

1218
01:33:32,635 --> 01:33:33,355
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1219
01:33:33,575 --> 01:33:41,058
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, this goes back to my request, um, about three or four weeks ago, uh, to sit down with Republic and discuss their, their policies and practices.

1220
01:33:42,079 --> 01:33:50,562
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, and again, uh, no response, uh, to see we are, where we're going with this, uh, uh, you know, to talk about things that have been done wrong in the past and how to make them better going forward.

1221
01:33:51,002 --> 01:33:52,303
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you know, he talked about that.

1222
01:33:52,423 --> 01:33:57,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, uh, a few weeks ago I had a similar problem, uh, with the Republic president.

1223
01:33:57,745 --> 01:33:59,286
[SPEAKER_14]: He was, uh, harassing,

1224
01:34:00,443 --> 01:34:02,825
[SPEAKER_14]: a handicapped person for not moving his car fast enough.

1225
01:34:03,745 --> 01:34:27,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Granted, the guy was in violation, the parking was in violation, and the gentleman who was harassing was a triple amputee, and I explained to the parking person that the gentleman isn't able to walk that fast, and his response to me was, I don't really care, for which I took exception, and I did report him to Dan Nash at the company,

1226
01:34:28,798 --> 01:34:30,959
[SPEAKER_14]: since never heard anything back about that.

1227
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:37,081
[SPEAKER_14]: But I felt that the gentleman, I told Dan, I felt that the gentleman was doing an apology for the rude treatment that he was given.

1228
01:34:37,101 --> 01:34:41,243
[SPEAKER_14]: And I say, if I didn't see it for myself, it wasn't secondhand.

1229
01:34:42,163 --> 01:34:42,903
[SPEAKER_14]: It was something I saw.

1230
01:34:42,943 --> 01:34:49,286
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, this was a motion I asked for to sit down with them to discuss their policies going forward, Mr. President.

1231
01:34:50,966 --> 01:34:58,109
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for approval on Councilor Falco as amended by Councilor Caraviello, Councilor London Kern.

1232
01:34:58,401 --> 01:34:58,761
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1233
01:34:59,081 --> 01:35:07,003
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just would like to ask if I could further amend this because I received an email this week with regards to a business owner of a daycare.

1234
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:18,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Another portion of the, I'm not sure if it's in the contract or something they were going to adhere to is the leniency during pickup and drop off for daycares and schools in the city of Medford.

1235
01:35:18,765 --> 01:35:24,066
[SPEAKER_12]: And from what I understand over the last couple of weeks, that leniency is no more.

1236
01:35:24,694 --> 01:35:34,762
[SPEAKER_12]: and they're now ticketing, Republic Parking is now ticketing people who are going in three minutes to drop off somebody, you know, their child at a daycare or at a school.

1237
01:35:35,202 --> 01:35:36,903
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's something we were promised.

1238
01:35:36,943 --> 01:35:46,070
[SPEAKER_12]: This council specifically asked for leniency in schools and we were promised that there would be leniency before, you know, during the drop off and during the pickup.

1239
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:50,113
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not sure if this in mass coincides with

1240
01:35:50,548 --> 01:35:55,349
[SPEAKER_12]: The fact that revenues, the big article came out that revenues are short for public parking.

1241
01:35:55,869 --> 01:36:01,010
[SPEAKER_12]: But just because your revenues are short doesn't mean you can violate the rules, violate your promises.

1242
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:04,350
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would just like to ask for public parking that as well.

1243
01:36:04,850 --> 01:36:06,951
[SPEAKER_12]: This take care, I believe, is on Riverside Ave.

1244
01:36:07,411 --> 01:36:11,331
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm not sure if it's going on in other locations.

1245
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:18,893
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm assuming from what I've been hearing, there's some ticketing that should not be happening during certain times in certain places.

1246
01:36:20,703 --> 01:36:21,223
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a shame.

1247
01:36:21,904 --> 01:36:25,225
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended by vice-president local current council night.

1248
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:32,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Mr. President, I noticed in our packet that we had not received an update relative to the issues that we discussed on Marion street.

1249
01:36:32,748 --> 01:36:42,653
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was hoping we could amend this paper to, uh, ask for a update on that situation as well relative to the, uh, resident annual parking on Marion street that we discussed last week.

1250
01:36:43,193 --> 01:36:47,695
[SPEAKER_05]: As amended by council night on the motion for approval by council Falco as seconded by council cab yellow.

1251
01:36:48,172 --> 01:36:49,352
[SPEAKER_05]: and amended as noted.

1252
01:36:49,672 --> 01:36:50,372
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1253
01:36:50,993 --> 01:36:53,393
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1254
01:36:53,413 --> 01:36:54,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Councilor.

1255
01:36:55,553 --> 01:36:56,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we're on to suspension.

1256
01:36:56,654 --> 01:36:57,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caraviello.

1257
01:36:57,154 --> 01:37:09,536
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, in our package this evening, I made a resolution back in January 12, 16-206, in regards to the pay phones that are scattered around the city.

1258
01:37:09,816 --> 01:37:15,697
[SPEAKER_14]: We got a response back this evening, and I'm questioning a part of it.

1259
01:37:16,417 --> 01:37:19,639
[SPEAKER_14]: I have contacted Verizon in awaiting a response.

1260
01:37:20,159 --> 01:37:27,683
[SPEAKER_14]: The pedestal of 492 High Street is located on private property, and I request that Verizon contacts the property owner to discuss this rule.

1261
01:37:28,243 --> 01:37:30,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, all there is is a pedestal with no phone there.

1262
01:37:30,725 --> 01:37:32,726
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it just looks — it's unsightly.

1263
01:37:33,246 --> 01:37:39,169
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it goes on to say, the payphones at CVS and 43 Salem Street are active.

1264
01:37:39,649 --> 01:37:44,792
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, unless these people are very good, there's no — there's no thing to call on.

1265
01:37:47,070 --> 01:37:49,152
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you know, there's no receiver.

1266
01:37:49,172 --> 01:37:49,772
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no thing there.

1267
01:37:49,792 --> 01:37:52,214
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know how they're active.

1268
01:37:52,234 --> 01:38:01,120
[SPEAKER_14]: So if I, if you could send this back to the superintendent, why is I'm a little interested for clarification.

1269
01:38:01,961 --> 01:38:07,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion of council Caraviello to send back for clarification.

1270
01:38:07,992 --> 01:38:13,136
[SPEAKER_05]: to the Superintendent of Wires the recent response received.

1271
01:38:13,676 --> 01:38:14,477
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1272
01:38:15,358 --> 01:38:16,178
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1273
01:38:16,278 --> 01:38:20,402
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a paper in the hand of the clerk offered by Councilor Marks.

1274
01:38:20,462 --> 01:38:25,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the heavy trucking on Spring Street be discussed.

1275
01:38:25,305 --> 01:38:25,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

1276
01:38:26,466 --> 01:38:27,307
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1277
01:38:27,327 --> 01:38:31,830
[SPEAKER_10]: As we're all aware, there's a no heavy trucking ban on Spring Street.

1278
01:38:32,651 --> 01:38:37,535
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it was about a year and a half, two years ago, a number of residents came before this council

1279
01:38:38,015 --> 01:38:45,477
[SPEAKER_10]: concern that the city was not enforcing enough the trucks that are using Spring Street, the heavy trucks.

1280
01:38:46,257 --> 01:38:51,818
[SPEAKER_10]: And for a period of time, the problem was solved.

1281
01:38:52,319 --> 01:39:05,782
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's rearing its ugly head again that Spring Street is being used as a cut through for Penske truck, Budweiser, and a number of other businesses in the area, Mr. President.

1282
01:39:06,936 --> 01:39:12,120
[SPEAKER_10]: And for whatever reason, there's been a lack of enforcement by our police department.

1283
01:39:12,860 --> 01:39:17,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Back, I think it was a year and a half ago, I offered a resolution to create a trucking team.

1284
01:39:18,725 --> 01:39:21,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Many surrounding police departments have a trucking team.

1285
01:39:22,288 --> 01:39:25,470
[SPEAKER_10]: And it wasn't just to put on additional police officers.

1286
01:39:25,971 --> 01:39:33,977
[SPEAKER_10]: It was to address an issue of 18 wheelers traversing our roads, Mr. President, and at no fear of ever getting pulled over.

1287
01:39:34,968 --> 01:39:44,195
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is, from what I've been told by members of the police department, it's a particular training to pull these 18 wheelers over.

1288
01:39:44,215 --> 01:39:46,898
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to have the ability to be able to look at the log.

1289
01:39:47,218 --> 01:39:58,366
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got to have the ability to be able to read markings on the side of the truck, the type of liquids they may be carrying, the type of goods they may be carrying, the weight of the truck, and so forth.

1290
01:39:58,927 --> 01:40:04,251
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have to have ample training, and you have to have the equipment to pull these trucks over.

1291
01:40:04,977 --> 01:40:12,598
[SPEAKER_10]: And many of our police officers that I've spoken to aren't willing to pull these trucks over because they're not trained and not equipped.

1292
01:40:13,338 --> 01:40:15,059
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was the statement I got from them.

1293
01:40:15,459 --> 01:40:19,860
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think after a while, these truckers know, hey, you know what?

1294
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:21,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't go through Cambridge-Somerville.

1295
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:23,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Go through Method.

1296
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:24,400
[SPEAKER_10]: They won't pull you over.

1297
01:40:25,541 --> 01:40:29,341
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's posing a problem in our community.

1298
01:40:29,981 --> 01:40:33,982
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I would ask for enforcement, Mr. President,

1299
01:40:34,355 --> 01:40:36,656
[SPEAKER_10]: of the heavy trucking on Spring Street.

1300
01:40:37,776 --> 01:40:40,656
[SPEAKER_10]: We all know what happens after a period of time with heavy trucking.

1301
01:40:41,116 --> 01:40:43,537
[SPEAKER_10]: It creates the waves in the road.

1302
01:40:44,357 --> 01:40:45,137
[SPEAKER_10]: It really does.

1303
01:40:45,597 --> 01:40:48,778
[SPEAKER_10]: And we saw that firsthand on Spring Street in particular.

1304
01:40:49,158 --> 01:40:57,000
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if it was poor quality of tar that was put down or whatever it might have been, but it created a lot of ripples throughout the whole road.

1305
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:58,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was from the heavy trucking.

1306
01:40:58,980 --> 01:41:01,741
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask increased enforcement on Spring Street

1307
01:41:02,145 --> 01:41:08,032
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would also ask the chief of police to once again look at the creation of a truck team.

1308
01:41:09,274 --> 01:41:16,843
[SPEAKER_10]: I was told when you issue a ticket to an 18-wheeler, it could be upwards of $1,200 for a ticket.

1309
01:41:17,604 --> 01:41:20,288
[SPEAKER_10]: So the truck unit would pay for itself.

1310
01:41:20,876 --> 01:41:22,257
[SPEAKER_10]: doing the basic enforcement.

1311
01:41:22,477 --> 01:41:27,661
[SPEAKER_10]: And don't forget, we have major truck routes running through our community, through our neighborhoods.

1312
01:41:28,402 --> 01:41:38,069
[SPEAKER_10]: We saw what happened at Centilli Circle in Everett back some 10 years ago, when an 18-wheeler went off and went into the side of elderly housing over there.

1313
01:41:38,850 --> 01:41:45,535
[SPEAKER_10]: These are trucks speeding through our community and so forth, and it really poses a public safety concern.

1314
01:41:45,555 --> 01:41:49,018
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask that the chief look at the truck unit, Mr. President.

1315
01:41:49,714 --> 01:41:56,560
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I could just put in a plug while I'm speaking, we also don't have police patrol on the Mystic River.

1316
01:41:57,561 --> 01:42:01,064
[SPEAKER_10]: And people might say, oh, the Mystic River, you can walk over the Mystic River.

1317
01:42:01,584 --> 01:42:02,565
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's not the case.

1318
01:42:03,045 --> 01:42:07,609
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Medford High School, our young students, rowing on the Mystic River.

1319
01:42:08,109 --> 01:42:14,475
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't have, other than the fire department, which does have a way of getting onto the Mystic River.

1320
01:42:15,318 --> 01:42:17,580
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have any patrol of the Mystic River at all.

1321
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:21,562
[SPEAKER_10]: We would have to wait for state police to come through the locks in Boston.

1322
01:42:21,863 --> 01:42:24,424
[SPEAKER_10]: God forbid there was an accident on the Mystic River.

1323
01:42:25,325 --> 01:42:26,506
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had tournaments there.

1324
01:42:26,786 --> 01:42:33,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Just recently, the Medford Bowl Club had a tournament, a national tournament, actually, on the Mystic River.

1325
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:43,377
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, really, as a city, we fall short of the mark when it comes to protecting our riverway and also protecting against these 18-wheelers

1326
01:42:45,048 --> 01:42:50,489
[SPEAKER_10]: that are coming through our community without any fear of ever getting a ticket, Mr. President.

1327
01:42:50,809 --> 01:42:55,450
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would offer those two, as well as the enforcement on Spring Street for the heavy trucking.

1328
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:57,950
[SPEAKER_14]: So the motion of Councilor Marks as amended.

1329
01:42:57,990 --> 01:42:58,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

1330
01:42:58,850 --> 01:42:59,531
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1331
01:42:59,611 --> 01:43:02,211
[SPEAKER_14]: I commend Councilor Marks on bringing this forward.

1332
01:43:02,811 --> 01:43:07,232
[SPEAKER_14]: In the meantime, if the chief could contact the state police truck team.

1333
01:43:07,992 --> 01:43:14,033
[SPEAKER_14]: I see them occasionally on Mystic Avenue pulling trucks over, occasionally on the parkway, but they're not anywhere else.

1334
01:43:14,617 --> 01:43:17,738
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's right, when these trucks get pulled over, it's a pretty hefty fine.

1335
01:43:18,338 --> 01:43:27,321
[SPEAKER_14]: So if he could contact the state police or the DOT truck team to maybe increase its presence in the Method area, it would be greatly helped.

1336
01:43:27,381 --> 01:43:33,002
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the other thing you brought up, we have a position of harbormaster in the city.

1337
01:43:34,383 --> 01:43:36,843
[SPEAKER_14]: What does the harbormaster do?

1338
01:43:37,304 --> 01:43:41,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that something that should be looked upon as that safety?

1339
01:43:41,065 --> 01:43:42,445
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, who is the harbormaster?

1340
01:43:43,483 --> 01:43:44,684
[SPEAKER_14]: That's my other question.

1341
01:43:45,844 --> 01:43:46,484
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Mr. Burns.

1342
01:43:46,504 --> 01:43:57,670
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand Mr. Burns is maybe a little, he's an older gentleman, and I don't think we own a boat either for the harbormaster.

1343
01:43:58,510 --> 01:44:07,754
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe something, maybe having a harbormaster that's a little more up with the times might be something for the new administration to look at.

1344
01:44:08,235 --> 01:44:08,775
[SPEAKER_14]: Admiral Knight.

1345
01:44:09,866 --> 01:44:21,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I ask to amend the paper to request that the chief of police provide us with the number of complaints that they received in the past 12 months relative to heavy trucking on residential roadways, as well as the number of citations issued.

1346
01:44:21,913 --> 01:44:22,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

1347
01:44:22,914 --> 01:44:26,256
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Marks as amended.

1348
01:44:26,316 --> 01:44:27,236
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor.

1349
01:44:27,977 --> 01:44:28,897
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed.

1350
01:44:30,038 --> 01:44:33,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Records of the previous week's meeting were passed to Councilor Marks.

1351
01:44:33,453 --> 01:44:35,375
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Councilor, how did you find those records?

1352
01:44:35,896 --> 01:44:37,377
[SPEAKER_05]: I reviewed the records, Mr. President.

1353
01:44:37,417 --> 01:44:38,979
[SPEAKER_05]: I find them to be in order and move approval.

1354
01:44:39,159 --> 01:44:42,403
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion for approval of the previous records by Councilor Marks.

1355
01:44:42,463 --> 01:44:43,163
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1356
01:44:43,564 --> 01:44:44,305
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1357
01:44:44,345 --> 01:44:44,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion carries.

1358
01:44:45,546 --> 01:44:47,688
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello for adjournment.

1359
01:44:47,728 --> 01:44:48,469
[SPEAKER_05]: All those in favor?

1360
01:44:49,310 --> 01:44:49,871
[SPEAKER_05]: All those opposed?

1361
01:44:49,991 --> 01:44:50,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Meeting adjourned.
