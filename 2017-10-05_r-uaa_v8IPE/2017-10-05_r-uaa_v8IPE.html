    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=26.91s">President</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=27.891s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=29.111s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=31.753s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=45.942s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=47.932s">Motion</a>  to suspend the rules to take paper off the table.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=49.793s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo to suspend the rules to take what paper, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=54.936s">17-075,</a>  third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=57.217s">17-075,</a>  which would be the third reading for the law and order for the Newton Police Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=67.723s">Is</a>  the paper before us? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=69.044s">The</a>  paper is now before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=70.885s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=72.466s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo for approval, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=77.797s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Kramer.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=78.977s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=81.318s">I</a>  know before we took the first reading on this paper, we had discussed, and I think it was voted six to one, to take the next three months, along with the administration, to review and discuss cost analysis with regards to a potential dual station and discuss a number of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=103.677s">people's</a>  concerns with regards to the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=106.48s">So</a>  I wanted to see if we were going to schedule a meeting with the mayor on that before we.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=111.945s">The</a>  mayor did not respond to our resolution that I know of. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=116.409s">I</a>  haven't seen it in any of my packages. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=118.011s">I</a>  haven't either.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=119.092s">I</a>  haven't seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=120.833s">So</a>  I don't know what the council wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=124.877s">I</a>  just feel like that was a strong six to one vote with regards to <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=130.16s">looking</a>  into, and now I believe the fire station, I'm not sure, doesn't have any heat, and that's been going on, I think since the snowstorm, I was getting reports that there was no heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=140.704s">So</a>  I think it's pretty pertinent to, for at least a discussion, even if it's next week, we have a discussion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=147.346s">And</a>  I don't know if it's worth putting this off a week and seeing if we can get a response from the mayor's office on that resolution, but it was a strong six to one vote, and a number of people were in this audience in support of <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=160.637s">looking</a>  into a cost analysis and getting some numbers together, better than what we were provided, so we can really see if we can't afford the dual station and get a better idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=171.721s">I</a>  know a number of things were thrown around and certain contradictions were made a few weeks back, so I think some more clarity is in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=181.884s">I</a>  don't know how my colleagues feel.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=188.562s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=189.082s">I</a>  second the motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=191.864s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=199.89s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=201.131s">My</a>  name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=204.433s">I'm</a>  a former member of the Saugus Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=207.235s">I</a>  can appreciate what Councilor Lungelkorn is going to because apparently, I think folks, as I was speaking to them today, were led to believe it was going to be next Tuesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=215.888s">And</a>  here we are, we have nobody here from the fire department or the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=222.569s">But</a>  if you go back and look at your capital improvement plan that was offered by the mayor, there's quite a few locations and suggestions in here that raised itself well over two and a half million dollars as to where and how this is going to be funded as it relates to the fire station and into the police station part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=241.093s">You</a>  know, a lot of people don't even realize what just took place on the 14th of March <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=246.884s">the</a>  day of the storm, the unfortunate circumstance down the fire department and the police department, their generator went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=253.369s">Their</a>  backup generator to be supportive of their police operations, their telecommunications, their communications back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=261.034s">From</a>  what I understand and I believe it to be true, one if not maybe two of the doors of the fire department couldn't even be open because they had no electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=270.3s">And</a>  their backup generator, which apparently wasn't serviced like it should have been serviced, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=274.458s">was</a>  out for a couple of days and they had to wait for a pot, and that's all because of what took place with the storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=280.543s">You</a>  really have a whole host of issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=283.124s">You</a>  talk about a $2 billion seismic study for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=288.048s">None</a>  of you have gone through the reading of the over 690 pages of the $110,000 report that was written in January, submitted in January of 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=296.915s">You're</a>  going to be having here <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=301.613s">a</a>  little later this evening, because I see the superintendent here, and you're going to be having a discussion on something that relates to the high school in multi-millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=309.376s">And</a>  you really need to ask the same question. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=310.857s">You're</a>  going to have a seismic erratic study for that piece of property up there, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=315.018s">You</a>  know, I think it's unfair to the Medford taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=318.179s">Just</a>  like you folks, I am a taxpayer here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=321.981s">The</a>  building was built in 1962. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=325.542s">Same</a>  thing with the high school, honor about in that same year of category. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=329.026s">And</a>  they're looking for a major, major overhaul, if not reconstruction or additions to whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=336.754s">But</a>  the question really needs to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=338.796s">It's</a>  obvious that maintenance has not taken place in these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=342.228s">You,</a>  Councilor Caraviello, if you remember correctly, I think it was your first term, the beginning of your first term, you indicated that the all new schools at that point in time, which are 11 years old, was a million point one in arrears for fixtures. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=352.994s">And</a>  now it's still well in excess of a million, if not a million two, whatever it might be, 15 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=357.737s">And</a>  you don't want to get caught into the same trap that you got caught in before to buy and fix new schools, whether you go from 12 to three or whatever the amount was. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=365.662s">You</a>  built new schools because the old ones weren't maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=368.743s">And</a>  you're going to be looking at the same argument that's going to be presenting itself <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=371.999s">as</a>  it relates to the high school later on this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=374.6s">But</a>  this is too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=376.881s">You're</a>  talking about at the outset $22 million, $2 million for the alleged, I don't know where that dollar amount came from because I don't think any of you can answer how she came up with $2 million, and $20 million to pay for the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=389.168s">And</a>  as you heard here a couple of weeks ago when you had the director of finance up here, they're talking about 2022 before anything might be eligible for expiration of bonds that would be needed to pay for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=400.842s">So</a>  I think in all fairness, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to, there's no reason to jump into this thing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=408.106s">You've</a>  waited a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=410.687s">You</a>  haven't even satisfied the argument of where the training center would go and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=415.469s">And</a>  if we remember correctly, I think it was <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=417.657s">When</a>  the first reading took place, because the fire department were here in mass numbers, the mayor decided to include them in any future development as to where they might go. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=427.607s">To</a>  this date, the police department or its union have yet to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=432.692s">And</a>  you folks have yet to be involved in any type of involvement with this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=436.496s">And</a>  it just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=438.417s">It's</a>  not good political sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=439.919s">It's</a>  absolutely not good financial sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=442.949s">You</a>  know, you have over $28 million in the deficit in your pension system. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=446.931s">You</a>  have an application, as you're well aware of, Mr. President, before the Massachusetts Library Association for $20 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=453.094s">And</a>  if that comes through, the city of Medford pays 40% of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=456.295s">And</a>  you're looking at probably approximately over the next two or three years, if in fact the high school goes forward and gets its application approved with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=465.49s">$25</a>  million there of taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=468.194s">You're</a>  looking at a fire station and a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=471.359s">Can</a>  you please tell me who's going to pay for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=474.564s">This</a>  is nothing more than a leading to Proposition 2.5 override. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=478.53s">And</a>  if you look at your sister city of Somerville, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=480.913s">With</a>  all the development that has taken place over there, they have still raised their taxes on two, a single two and three family homes, which goes to prove and tell you that development for the sake of development is not always in the best interest of this community or any community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=497.186s">You</a>  really need to look at the long-term approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=500.175s">And</a>  the long-term approach right now would say, one more week, I don't think, is going to make a big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=505.537s">And</a>  you know, you're people all talking about transparency and being fluid and having this conversation with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=512.78s">Well,</a>  where is there all a branch extended to you to sit down and discuss and talk with you about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=518.663s">It's</a>  not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=519.863s">It's</a>  not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=521.084s">And</a>  what you're doing is the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=523.785s">And</a>  what you're doing, you're just accelerating the use and the argument <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=528.832s">to</a>  have more people run for this city council and to run for mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=533.138s">Because</a>  people are sick and tired and fed, and fed up of being told about all these expenses and not being a part of it, not being included. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=540.948s">And</a>  the council, likewise, not including them in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=544.958s">You're</a>  not talking about $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=547.059s">You're</a>  talking about $22 million right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=550.222s">$2</a>  million for the study, $20 million allegedly for the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=554.685s">None</a>  of you can explain how it's going to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=557.246s">None</a>  of you can explain how she got to the $2 million seismographic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=560.689s">You</a>  don't even know if an RFQ went out, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=564.151s">I</a>  think the move is wrong tonight if you vote for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=566.993s">That</a>  sends the wrong message. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=568.634s">And</a>  it's definitely, definitely not taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=571.176s">People</a>  are police department friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=573.922s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=574.642s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=577.844s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=581.945s">I</a>  would, with due respect, with regards to the resolve that was approved several weeks back, that we sit down and discuss this in more depth and ask the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=594.211s">I</a>  mean, like I said before, the headquarters building went down last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=599.153s">The</a>  backup generator went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=601.054s">There</a>  are a whole host of issues within that whole building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=604.334s">And</a>  when we're talking, I mean, the last speaker just hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=610.377s">We're</a>  talking about potential library, promised new fire station somewhere between 2022 and 2025, Medford High School potential updates, and maintenance of the rest of our schools and city buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=625.283s">I</a>  think we need to be on the same page and not just, I mean, I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=629.587s">This</a>  was so reactive, we need to be on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=632.889s">And</a>  I would ask that we table this for one week to sit down with the mayor before we vote on it or potentially vote on it next Tuesday so we can hash some things out.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=656.896s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=658.536s">I</a>  remember the vote that Council Lungo-Koehn is speaking about, and it was a 6 to 1 vote requesting that we meet with the administration, in particular the mayor, and discuss not only the building of the police department, also the feasibility and capital improvement plan of where we're going for future projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=681.984s">And</a>  as we'll hear tonight, we have the superintendent of schools here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=685.527s">And</a>  we're going to hear about a need for improvements within the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=690.53s">As</a>  was mentioned by Councilor Longo, we already know the public library is in need of some repairs or total rehab. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=699.537s">And</a>  there are a number of other issues, Mr. President, that I'm sure will be addressed when the superintendent gets up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=705.861s">But</a>  we should have a master plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=708.868s">And</a>  I know Councilor Falco has spoken about a master plan in the past and I've raised the issue to give at least a direction on where we're going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=718.039s">And</a>  we can't continue to operate and do business with the mayor's draft proposal of a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=725.207s">It's</a>  not even a capital plan, it's a draft proposal that the mayor is still working from. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=730.247s">And</a>  many of the issues in the draft proposal are not present in the letter that she wrote on March 17th to this council stating what the public schools needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=741.038s">needs</a>  are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=742.099s">So</a>  I'm not quite sure, Mr. President, where all this dialogue and debate is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=747.461s">It's</a>  probably happening in a vacuum in the mayor's office, but it's clearly not with the elected officials in this community and with the general public in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=755.665s">And</a>  I would agree, I think one week is not too long to wait to get some feedback on where we're going with the capital plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=765.71s">And</a>  as the council president, I think you should be wary of <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=769.922s">the</a>  fact that we're receiving things piecemeal again, and we've stated in the past that we refuse to do business like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=777.005s">I</a>  wouldn't operate my business, or I don't run my home that way, and we shouldn't operate a city government that way either, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=784.589s">So</a>  I support Councilor Lungo's motion to table for one week. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=790.171s">Councilor</a>  Lungo, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=791.272s">Just</a>  briefly, thank you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=793.673s">I</a>  think one simple thing that needs to be done, even if we can't discuss <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=798.43s">you</a>  know, everything within a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=799.811s">I</a>  think one thing that needs to be done is that capital plan that we were given about 9669 months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=806.373s">It's</a>  completely changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=807.894s">Um,</a>  something that was supposed to be done seven years from now is now being asked for the third reading tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=813.517s">So</a>  that needs to be revamped. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=815.457s">I</a>  mean, redrafted basically because the largest thing within that five year plan was the metric police station or, you know, an update in that of that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=824.021s">And</a>  that is completely changed the whole <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=826.588s">draft</a>  capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=828.308s">And</a>  I think that's just one simple thing that could be looked into and given to us within a week's time so that we have a better idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=835.85s">Even</a>  if it is just a draft, it's a better idea of where we're going, how we're moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=840.85s">And</a>  I think it's something that's necessary and we're not going to get it unless if we keep rubber stamping everything that's put before us.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=971.541s">Roy</a>  Bellison, Superintendent of Schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=978.562s">Mr.</a>  President, members of the Council, thank you for hearing us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=981.583s">The</a>  Medford School Committee recently approved a statement of interest to the Massachusetts School Building Authority, the purpose of which is to be very proactive and to find out, under the core program, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=996.908s">that</a>  is funded by MSBA, what projects would be fundable for Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1007.537s">This</a>  particular SOI does not bind the city financially in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1012.201s">What</a>  it does is it enables the process to begin and to bring out a team from MSBA to sit with us to go over the various projects that may be possible <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1024.022s">and</a>  to determine what they would be considered eligible for possible funding going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1031.484s">Now,</a>  if in fact they identify projects that are eligible for going forward, we would then have to come back to you and talk to you about the possibility of doing a feasibility study, which would then possibly lead to design, and then later construction documents, which would then lead to an actual implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1051.168s">But</a>  at this point, all we're asking <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1053.074s">you</a>  for is approval to submit to the state an opportunity to meet with their team to review what we have at our schools and determine what is eligible for funding under their current funding structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1068.365s">I</a>  think it's a very proactive thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1069.886s">I</a>  think it's consistent with what I just heard about being part of a plan rather than simply asking for an item at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1076.851s">And</a>  I think that it's the kind of thing that we want to do to know what we can go forward with on our own or what we should go forward with on our own and what we clearly need support from the state for or could be eligible for support from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1090.1s">I</a>  think it's particularly significant since as we look at the future, inflation of construction costs certainly goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1097.788s">and</a>  the possibility of the reduction of reimbursement goes down as the city's wealth increases and our eligibility for a higher reimbursement rate might decrease. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1108.297s">This</a>  is clearly something that would, if it goes forward, would be a two to three year activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1113.561s">It</a>  wouldn't be something that would happen overnight, but it would be something that enables us to get into the discussion range with the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1123.049s">So</a>  with that, I just ask that the City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1126.618s">approve</a>  what the school committee has already approved, allow us to submit a statement of interest to MSBA so that we can begin the process of exploring what might be helpful to us in Medford and what we can have the state share the cost of. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1142.848s">Happy</a>  to take any questions.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1144.029s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendents. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1145.83s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1147.411s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1149.633s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Billson for, Superintendent Billson, for coming before us with this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1155.677s">If</a>  you could <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1156.572s">maybe</a>  with your experience, go over what type of projects would be funded through these types of 55% reimbursement grants, just so we can kind of have an idea of, I guess, the history of the grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1172.196s">And</a>  that would be my first question.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1173.676s">So</a>  there are two programs at MSBA that take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1178.898s">One</a>  is called Accelerated Repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1181.267s">That's</a>  not the program we're applying under. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1183.029s">This</a>  is the core program for renovation and rebuilding and possible new construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1190.156s">There</a>  are priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1191.217s">There</a>  are different seven priorities that the state lists that they would consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1195.681s">We</a>  have selected four of them that we've brought in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1201.847s">All</a>  the items listed may not be items we're interested in, but we put them down because if the state comes out, we'll talk about everything that's possible and see what their interest level is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1213.174s">So,</a>  for example, it's highly unlikely that we're interested in boilers because we just replaced the boilers, okay, at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1220.698s">But</a>  we put it down because boilers lead to a discussion of heating systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1225.02s">An</a>  important thing to talk about is an upgrade, if you will, of the fire alarm system. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1230.025s">at</a>  Medford High School, it goes back to 1970. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1232.748s">So</a>  it's clear that this is a good time to look at the fire alarm system. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1238.173s">We</a>  know that the roof was replaced in 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1242.137s">We</a>  know that at some point in time, the roof is going to need <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1245.213s">a</a>  replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1245.893s">We</a>  think it's five, six years out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1247.974s">But</a>  if we got funding for it, it would be propitious to move forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1253.134s">We</a>  know that the vocational school is moving into very high-tech areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1259.736s">And</a>  anything that would allow us to improve our shops in ways that would enable us to offer state-of-the-art programs above and beyond what we're currently doing is an advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1269.938s">So</a>  anything that moves the show forward <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1272.823s">enables</a>  us to look at the things that would be useful going forward as something that we would like to explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1279.028s">Another</a>  example would be the floor tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1281.75s">The</a>  floor tiles contain a certain amount of asbestos in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1285.232s">Now,</a>  they're not dangerous because they're not friable, but you can't pick them up without an abatement, and an abatement costs a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1293.558s">So</a>  if we're going to have to change the flooring, if we're going to improve the flooring and things of that type, then we should have somebody else join with us and partner with us in the funding of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1302.855s">So</a>  those are the kinds of discussions we would like to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1306.436s">We</a>  certainly know that some things they'll tell us we're not high enough priority for because there are other places that are in greater need. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1314.439s">But</a>  there are some things that might actually fly through and we'd like to find out what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1319.2s">And</a>  that will inform not only a funding proposal potentially going forward, which would then come before you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1326.213s">But</a>  it also informs what we would then push for in local capital funding, which would be necessary to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1332.684s">Technology</a>  is another major area, with testing now being done on computers, with <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1338.338s">reporting</a>  all being done on computers and data management and the like, it's critical that, you know, our technology be totally up to date and 100% that we continue to move forward with that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1350.547s">That's</a>  an area that might be of interest to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1353.289s">We</a>  certainly would move forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1354.61s">We've</a>  also applied or will apply under the e-rate program, the universal libraries program, and we think we're eligible for about $600,000 there on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1364.941s">So</a>  these are things that we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1366.862s">We</a>  want to advance our possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1369.324s">We</a>  want to put before you all the possibilities for outside funding that will complement local funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1375.869s">And</a>  the only way we can find out is if we sit with the state in a formal process and review and explore what they would consider a priority for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1385.436s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1387.077s">That</a>  kind of answered what was going to be my second question, kind of as, what is Medford looking for for our high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1395.276s">versus</a>  what in the past these grants have been used for in other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1400.659s">So</a>  with that being said, did the school committee or did you bring anything for us tonight with regards to a list, something in writing that says what the city of Medford's needs are for the high school?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1413.666s">Well,</a>  the SOI includes everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1416.499s">The</a>  SOI just simply talks about everything possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1420.342s">We</a>  would look at the entire building with MSBA and not leave anything out that they might consider eligible for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1428.928s">The</a>  school committee obviously wants to anticipate possible needs going forward, as I indicated, flooring, staircases, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1437.217s">The</a>  fire alarm system, these are things, the roof, these are things that should be looked at because the building is going to be 50 years old in another couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1445.727s">And</a>  we have a very solid building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1448.591s">It's</a>  not a building that needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1451.354s">You</a>  can't buy a CMU building anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1455.978s">with</a>  the kind of money out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1457.338s">Somerville</a>  is, what, $250 million to replace a building? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1461.399s">Minuteman</a>  is $155 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1463.84s">Waltham's</a>  looking at a couple hundred million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1466.341s">We're</a>  not going to spend that kind of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1467.801s">We</a>  have the solid structure, but we have to make sure the internal systems are going to be up to date so they can go for another 40, 50 years before someone has to consider whether this building has any further life. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1480.67s">So</a>  that's sort of what we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1482.071s">I</a>  think the school committee wants to understand and hear what the state is willing to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1486.776s">And</a>  I think we have a very extensive list of just almost a laundry list of everything we would look at.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1492.041s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1495.144s">So</a>  you have the list to provide to us?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1497.286s">It's</a>  on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1498.587s">If</a>  you read through, you'll see the things that the school committee approved as things they would like the MSBA to look at.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1512.513s">Where</a>  is that list? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1513.313s">I</a>  have like a list that says number one and then on the second page it says number six, number seven.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1518.955s">That</a>  it references. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1521.096s">So</a>  under each of the four priorities to address, we list a whole series of things we'd like MSBA to look at with us.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1530.679s">Is</a>  that on the last page, number six, number seven?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1533.72s">Those</a>  are one, the last two pages.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1538.481s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1541.113s">Is</a>  that on the document dated March 17th, 2017? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1543.475s">March</a>  16th, 2017.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1546.457s">March</a>  16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1547.177s">Yeah,</a>  well, my address is March 17th, mine's March 16th.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1550.8s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor LaRusso.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1555.443s">So</a>  just so I understand it better, would the SOI come in and bring in their own experts so they would know how out of date our systems are or when they're going to eventually need updating? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1568.754s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1569.395s">So</a>  the heating experts, so they would be telling us, the first priority is the roof, then the heating, then the boilers have another 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1577.06s">So</a>  they'd give you a list and say, you are eligible for these funds and not these.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1581.744s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1582.264s">They</a>  would tell us, these are the things that we would consider funding with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1586.447s">These</a>  are the things you're going to do yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1588.829s">Point</a>  of information, if I can.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1591.151s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1593.412s">From</a>  what you just said, Mr. Superintendent, what Councilwoman <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1598.741s">Longo</a>  just mentioned, the confusion that I want to make clear is, you're telling us they'll tell us what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1609.186s">But</a>  let's say something is needed today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1617.11s">And</a>  we're saying, let's say the HVAC needs to be done today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1621.632s">But</a>  they had that on their list as three to be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1625.592s">Are</a>  we going to fund their request instead of what we think is, like the HVAC, that's probably the... So that's a discussion, Councilor, that we would have.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1636.176s">First</a>  we want to know who's going to join with us on what projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1639.777s">And</a>  then the school committee, and then obviously you, because you have to bond with us, to determine which items will take precedence and priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1649.42s">Because</a>  otherwise, you know, we have a plan that <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1652.646s">might</a>  avoid doing something that we consider more important and MSBA might not consider as a priority for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1660.929s">But</a>  we have to begin to understand what they will fund so we can understand how many dollars we might have left to tackle other issues and go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1670.333s">Now</a>  it may be something they're willing to fund that we don't care to fund in the short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1675.418s">We</a>  can keep it on the boards, but once they determine it's eligible, we can go back and apply for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1680.58s">So</a>  the goal is to know what we can apply for so that we know which items have to be funded by ourselves and which items can be funded in partnership, and then to determine the prioritization and the timing of each of these projects.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1695.227s">And</a>  one of my last questions, with regards to the amount of these grants that are given, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1702.461s">if</a>  you know from other cities and towns that have got them in the past, or if Medford has gotten any, what are we talking? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1708.925s">Are</a>  we talking you'll maybe get a grant for one or two things? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1713.728s">Is</a>  there a cap amount-wise? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1715.789s">Or</a>  are we talking, are we potentially $20, $30 million?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1720.732s">It</a>  really depends on what they determine eligibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1724.954s">Somerville,</a>  when they're rebuilding the high school, I guess, is eligible for about $130 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1729.967s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1730.528s">Now,</a>  we're not, I don't think we're in that category. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1734.03s">We're</a>  looking at something much smaller than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1735.892s">But</a>  clearly, whatever they determine we're eligible for, we'll put a price tag on it after we do some feasibility work. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1743.078s">And</a>  then we can decide how much this community wants to invest at this particular point in time or going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1749.043s">But</a>  at least we know <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1751.119s">what</a>  our partners are willing to put up on the table so that we can give you an informed proposal for both local capital planning and partnered capital planning.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1762.244s">And</a>  my last question, I guess, would be with regards to, I guess, the whole system, Medford High School and all of our other elementary and grade schools with regards to every school needing maintenance, having maintenance issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1776.65s">I've</a>  heard from a few <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1778.035s">parents</a>  over the last month or so and beyond with regards to issues within each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1783.917s">Have</a>  the grade schools and the elementary schools also been looked at with regards to their needs and how we are going to kind of assess it all, this and the grade schools?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1794.422s">So</a>  the school committee had several meetings on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1797.723s">And</a>  it's our impression that while there are things to be done at every school, obviously you have to keep it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1805.676s">The</a>  major issues will be going forward at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1808.498s">High</a>  school is now the oldest major building in our possession. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1814.541s">One</a>  of the things I told the school committee, so I feel comfortable sharing it here, is that in next year's budget, I will look to increase the amount of money put in for maintenance across the board so that we can do some of the things that people have raised independent of any capital planning and independent of any state-funded planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1834.296s">We</a>  also have grants, as we've indicated before, that are also giving us money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1839.18s">For</a>  example, we got $100,000 or just under $100,000 in biosciences recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1844.404s">We</a>  got a $500,000 grant in capital skills development from the state just the other day, a week ago Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1852.069s">And</a>  we've got some other grants out there they're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1854.271s">There's</a>  about $600,000, $700,000 in technology funding that we are eligible for that we're putting together the proposed for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1860.896s">It's</a>  an entitlement as long as we meet certain requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1863.965s">So</a>  we're putting all of this together to come so that we can actually deal with issues with other people's money as much as possible, but certainly recognizing that not everything that we want to do will be eligible for funding by an outside agency.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1880.493s">That's</a>  it for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1881.013s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1881.813s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1883.714s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1884.594s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1886.115s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent Felsen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1889.757s">Thanks</a>  for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1890.957s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1892.717s">The</a>  building is 50 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1894.318s">It</a>  was going to be 50 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1896.378s">It</a>  definitely needs improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1898.479s">I</a>  talk to parents on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1902.341s">And</a>  a lot of parents that don't have kids at the high school yet, but they've been up to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1907.623s">And</a>  the building does need work. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1909.644s">When</a>  I was on the school committee with Councilor Scarpelli, we had the science lab renovation, 17 new science labs, which was <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1921.124s">a</a>  great project for the community, for the school system, and really, you know, the state-of-the-art school labs and science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1929.827s">And</a>  these are important, especially for programming, future programming for the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1936.369s">And,</a>  you know, we want to make sure that we have these programs in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1939.97s">We</a>  want to make sure our buildings are up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1942.851s">I</a>  mean, there's one thing that I learned when I was on the school committee is people have an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1947.885s">people</a>  have a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1949.025s">Years</a>  ago, you went to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1951.246s">Maybe</a>  you went to parochial school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1952.746s">Now</a>  you can go to public school, public charter school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1955.307s">You</a>  can go to private school, parochial school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1957.047s">I</a>  mean, there's all kinds of options for people now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1959.327s">So</a>  I think a lot of people would like to go to school right here in Medford, but they want to make sure that their facilities are first class in nature and make sure that the programs that are being offered, for example, at the vocational school, are first rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1976.091s">And</a>  I think we're heading in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1978.442s">But</a>  I think we do need a cash infusion to make sure that a lot of this happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1982.184s">And</a>  it's nice to see that to potentially get 55% reimbursement from the state, that doesn't come along every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1989.807s">And</a>  we took advantage of that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1992.428s">When</a>  the science labs came across, I think we got 55, maybe even a little bit more, a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1999.311s">Between</a>  55 and 60%, I think, reimbursement on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2002.473s">So</a>  I think this is a great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2005.494s">And</a>  I think that it's something that we should take advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2008.773s">One</a>  of the questions that I had with regard to, you mentioned HVAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2013.774s">So</a>  would the HVAC include the actual individual heating systems in each of the classrooms at the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2018.656s">Okay,</a>  that's perfect because I know one of the complaints that I got when I was on the school committee was, you know, it'd be hot and cold in some of the buildings and sometimes there'd be no heat at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2028.719s">So</a>  I think that would be a definite good addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2035.604s">I</a>  also want to talk about the, let's see, you mentioned here in this memo it says, number seven, replacement of or addition to obsolete buildings in order to provide a full range of programs consistent with state and approved local requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2051.535s">MPS</a>  is seeking additional space on the high school campus by adding a cafeteria that can accommodate up to at least 500 students, a performing arts center that can accommodate up to 1,000 guests, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2061.75s">adequate</a>  locker room facilities for male and female athletes, a fitness and wellness center, and expansion of vocational technical space to create a career pathway model. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2072.952s">Can</a>  you comment on that a little bit? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2074.453s">Is</a>  that talking about possibly a new structure, or is that building off the structures that we currently have?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2080.334s">So</a>  let me give you a couple of examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2082.754s">Anyone</a>  who's been up to high school, by the way, with a lot of, and with your help, by the way, and I appreciate that, a lot of capital projects have been done, and I could enumerate them <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2091.13s">You</a>  know, at some point, if you're interested, the council has approved money for them, so I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2096.653s">But</a>  let's take the locker rooms at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2099.335s">You've</a>  been up to the locker rooms at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2100.815s">You</a>  know they're old, and you know that they're not particularly what we want them to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2105.578s">The</a>  girls' locker room, it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2108.159s">There's</a>  a lot of old things in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2110.221s">There's</a>  a lot of old marble, old shower stalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2113.229s">It's</a>  a lot of empty space, unutilized space. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2116.593s">That</a>  needs to be redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2118.214s">Because</a>  if it's redone, we'll recapture some space for other programming, and we can provide a state-of-the-art locker room for the young women to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2127.504s">The</a>  same thing is true with the men's locker room. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2131.033s">We</a>  need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2132.034s">It's</a>  just these are the things that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2133.735s">When</a>  you talk about a performing arts center, that may be a little aspirational, you know, in regard because, you know, we're talking about having a program that promotes the theater arts and promotes media and the like, but I don't know that we need to go to 1,000 seats right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2149.343s">So</a>  that may be a little bit aspirational, but the people doing the thinking raised it and said, you know, let's put it down and let's see if there's some interest in doing more with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2160.543s">I</a>  think those are the kinds of cafeteria right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2163.005s">There's</a>  three cafeterias. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2164.587s">It</a>  may be that we can reconfigure them, especially since right now, as you undoubtedly have heard, maybe read in the transcript recently, we're redoing the Cafe Electra into a brand new hospitality and restaurant suite with state money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2180.628s">And</a>  that's critical because that's going to be up on the first floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2183.409s">That's</a>  going to be a restaurant for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2185.39s">That's</a>  going to tie into our partnerships with WIN, which is creating the casino up the street and developing job opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2193.955s">That's</a>  going to tie into a whole pile of activities and revenue generating activities that will support other programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2201.565s">And</a>  that will free up space where Cafe Elector is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2204.126s">And</a>  we can do some other things with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2205.506s">So</a>  this is a whole process of looking at how we can reconfigure space to our greatest advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2212.028s">Now</a>  the print shop, because they don't use the big presses anymore, can now go down to a smaller place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2217.87s">We</a>  don't have to give them the big cavern that they had because they don't use that anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2222.131s">That's</a>  not what printing is about anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2224.651s">So</a>  Dr. Riccio, for example, has created what we'll call clusters or academies. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2230.808s">putting</a>  programs together, human service programs together, construction programs together, programs that deal with media and development together, so that they can interact with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2243.234s">So</a>  that a youngster, when they're trained, is cross-trained for more than one area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2248.076s">That</a>  creates great opportunities for our young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2250.617s">Instead</a>  of being trained only in one area, you're trained in multiple areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2253.719s">You</a>  may have noticed that we've virtually recaptured all the students from Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2258.261s">By</a>  next year, we'll have only eight students at Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2261.233s">We'll</a>  have saved a million dollars a year on that alone by putting these programs together. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2267.977s">By</a>  bringing some students in from the outside, we're recapturing revenue, possibly projecting over two or three years a million dollars a year in new revenue coming into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2277.103s">This</a>  is going to help us weather the storm, whether it's federal cutbacks, state failure to pay, or some of the local issues, the priorities that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2285.689s">So</a>  these are ways that I think we're moving forward, and I believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2290.38s">Looking</a>  at our school at 50 years of age and looking for another 50 years from that building is a really good time to start and be proactive now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2298.582s">Plan,</a>  recognizing we've got to come back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2302.084s">You're</a>  not voting for money tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2303.384s">You're</a>  voting for planning tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2305.084s">You're</a>  voting to be proactive, to look and see what's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2308.686s">And</a>  that's what we were asking you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2309.906s">And</a>  I think it's a great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2311.586s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2311.926s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2314.027s">I</a>  agree with you with regard to the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2317.306s">In</a>  my opinion, I think it's the hidden jewel of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2319.747s">I</a>  mean, there are so many great opportunities that are happening at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2324.249s">You</a>  know, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2325.189s">Riccio</a>  and her staff are doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2328.03s">And</a>  I mean, there's so much demand now to go to the vocational school, and it's kind of the best of both worlds. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2333.992s">You</a>  learn a trade, and you can still go to college if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2336.793s">So</a>  you really, you have the best of both worlds. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2340.535s">It's</a>  an exciting time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2341.375s">There</a>  are more and more young kids going to the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2344.997s">It's</a>  a great time to reinvest, not only in the high school, but in the shops of the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2351.081s">I</a>  mean, when you think about it, at the end of the day, our buildings are our most important assets with regard to the future of Method students. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2358.325s">We</a>  need to make sure that they are first class and make sure that all of our technology is current as can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2367.311s">You</a>  had mentioned previously about the potential for feasibility studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2373.07s">So</a>  if we have to do a feasibility study, is that something that we would have to pay for, or is that something that would be, would the MSBA help out with the cost of something like that?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2382.594s">If</a>  we become eligible, we would then petition MSBA for the feasibility, a feasibility study for the specific projects that we determined were the priority that we wanted to go with them for, or with, and they would reimburse us <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2400.462s">At</a>  the same rate, they would reimburse the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2403.164s">So</a>  if the feasibility study was $500,000 and we're eligible for 50%, we'd get $250,000 back. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2410.589s">We</a>  lay it out, but they reimburse us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2413.931s">I'm</a>  all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2415.312s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2415.952s">Thank</a>  you, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2416.812s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2417.993s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2419.534s">Mr.</a>  Bellson, thank you for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2421.536s">I</a>  think you do a great job, and I appreciate you coming down here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2425.938s">So</a>  I think it's safe to say that you feel as though <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2428.93s">going</a>  forward with this statement of interest is the most prudent course at this point in time?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2433.514s">It</a>  gets us in the game, and it allows us to consider our options, which I think is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2439.078s">Earlier</a>  this evening I heard you talking, you want to consider options, well you want to know who's going to pay for what. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2443.681s">And</a>  if you've got somebody else who wants to pay for it, or will help you pay for it, you want to know that before you put your own money on the table.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2451.019s">And</a>  this matter did come before the school committee and it was endorsed by the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2454.76s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2454.84s">I</a>  have the copies of the votes if you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2456.38s">Do</a>  you recall what the vote was? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2457.9s">Pardon</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2458.2s">Do</a>  you recall what the vote was?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2459.12s">7-0.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2459.56s">7-0.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2460.001s">So</a>  it's endorsed by the superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2462.541s">It's</a>  endorsed by the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2464.221s">And</a>  the purpose of the paper before us this evening, as I understand it, is that you're really seeking permission to meet with the state to examine what competitive grant opportunities the Massachusetts School Building Authority has out there for us that the Metro Public School District may be eligible for?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2479.044s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2480.716s">by</a>  submitting this application in the statement of interest, the Massachusetts School Building Authority in no way guarantees that we're going to receive money in the city of Medford, in no way guarantees that we're going to expend money?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2491.306s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2492.727s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2493.968s">Move</a>  for approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2496.491s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2498.833s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2500.014s">And</a>  I want to thank Superintendent Belson for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2504.458s">As</a>  the superintendent stated, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2507.505s">This</a>  council, over the last several years, has approved many building programs within the Medford High School and the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2519.391s">And</a>  I think we've been very supportive as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2523.113s">My</a>  question tonight, Mr. President, is not regarding whether or not the high school needs improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2529.075s">I</a>  have two students that attend Medford High School, and I can speak firsthand that Medford High School, indeed, needs improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2538.495s">But</a>  my question to the superintendent is, my first question, back in September of 2016, the school committee, along with Mayor Burke, formulated a priority facility improvement list, of which they outlined $13,787,000 worth of repairs in the high school and our other school buildings, of which $10,100,000 was earmarked to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2567.642s">Of</a>  that 10,100,000, Mr. Superintendent, what percentage of that 10,100,000 is in the current SOI?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2576.223s">So</a>  I can't tell you that because basically we listed almost everything that we possibly could think of in the SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2583.145s">So</a>  it really depends on what the state determines would be eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2588.886s">I</a>  would say most of the things that we listed on that would be something we would discuss with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2594.167s">There</a>  may be some things that they would say, that's your problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2597.403s">You</a>  know, okay.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2598.384s">So,</a>  so, and the reason why I asked Mr. Superintendent is, and I'll get into this a little bit later on, but, uh, we were recently told three weeks ago that, uh, in order to build a combined police and fire center, that we were told this by a treasurer collector and also by the mayor that, uh, the amount of money we were looking to bond would cause the city to have to go into a proposition two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2624.368s">And</a>  that was one of the factors the administration stated why we couldn't bond for $38 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2630.049s">So</a>  the reason why I'm trying to get some facts and figures tonight is I want to make sure that we're not going down the same avenue that the mayor and the treasurer-collector were so adamantly opposed to three weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2644.793s">And</a>  I'm hoping to get those answers from you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2648.474s">So</a>  as part of the SOI, from what I can see, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2652.902s">The</a>  capital plan that was put forth by the mayor and the school committee back in September of 2016 did not include a 500-student cafeteria, did not include a performing arts center for 1,000 students, did not include a fitness center, and did not include, from what I can see, windows and boilers. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2679.585s">Now</a>  if I could just finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2681.727s">So</a>  based on the $10 million that was out there for other renovations, which included Medford High School flooring, which you mentioned had asbestos, which I would agree needs to be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2694.354s">Roof</a>  replacement for $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2696.676s">Fire</a>  alarm system, which we know has been on the blink for a number of years, for $1,200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2705.028s">And</a>  $1 million to deconstruct the skateboard area and install modular units in the back of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2714.272s">So</a>  at what expense is the addition of a cafeteria for 500 students, a performing arts center for 1,000, fitness center, windows, and boilers going to add to the $10 million that the school committee came out in September of 2016? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2729.938s">OK,</a>  so let me try and answer this way.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2732.038s">They're</a>  all good questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2732.999s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2734.395s">Personally,</a>  I allowed the planning team at the high school to put down some of their aspirational things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2742.039s">Now,</a>  I don't personally think I need a 500-student cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2746.002s">Personally,</a>  I don't think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2747.543s">But</a>  I wouldn't tell my people they can't ask for it and let somebody else tell them, we don't think we'd fund that, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2753.926s">So</a>  I don't think that's going to be something MSBA is going to be interested in, because I think they already know we have cafeterias. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2760.57s">And</a>  they'd say, probably, why don't you just put a coat of paint on and do some other things? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2764.395s">So</a>  I don't think that's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2766.377s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2767.397s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2768.498s">And</a>  I appreciate what you're saying, but doesn't that just muddy the waters? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2771.46s">Because</a>  when I look at the SOI request, I'll be quite frank, it looks like we're building a brand new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2779.747s">I</a>  mean, if you go through the list from roof to boiler to windows to flooring, I mean, it looks like we're building a brand new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2786.612s">And</a>  I think to add stuff into the SOI that maybe you didn't agree upon as superintendent or thought it wasn't a priority, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2794.551s">I</a>  think muddies the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2796.852s">And</a>  what we have here, in my opinion, is a project that is probably closer to $30 or $40 million if we were to get total funding or total approval, I should say, from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2811.541s">And</a>  I know there's reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2813.622s">The</a>  number 55% has been tossed around. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2816.044s">I</a>  talked to the State Building Assistance Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2819.166s">Don't</a>  bet your bottom dollar on 55%. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2821.107s">In</a>  the past, we've received <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2823.285s">upwards</a>  of 59% for the science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2825.866s">But</a>  there is nothing set in stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2828.668s">I</a>  know the mayor put that in her letter, but according to the school building assistance, they have not arrived at any funding percentages as of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2837.292s">So</a>  in a good predicament, we could get 50%. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2842.115s">But</a>  my question, Mr. Superintendent, why throw everything into the mix? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2846.717s">Shouldn't</a>  we be looking at our major priorities? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2849.879s">We</a>  should be looking at the major deficiencies in the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2853.0s">Because</a>  that's what the SOI calls for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2854.961s">It</a>  calls for the major deficiencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2857.203s">And</a>  you yourself are saying, I don't think our deficiency is adding a 1,000-person performance center or a 500-person cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2865.817s">but</a>  it may be the alarm system or it may be an issue like Councilor Scarpelli talked about, other building improvements that need to be done immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2875.702s">So</a>  I think that's the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2877.323s">Why</a>  are we throwing everything at the wall right now?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2880.364s">Again,</a>  as I said to you, the SOI is a planning document. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2884.166s">It's</a>  to get you into an exploration process and to find out what the state is willing to pay for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2890.189s">So</a>  you put down everything to talk about, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2892.48s">And</a>  you find out that they're going to discard a few things here and a few things there, and maybe several things, and say that's really not important enough to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2899.365s">But</a>  we'll find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2901.967s">The</a>  document that you had in front of you is really a document that was produced in September, or early on, based on what people thought at that particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2911.394s">Different</a>  things emerge. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2912.828s">People</a>  want to talk about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2914.449s">There</a>  are some ideas that the headmaster has, that the vocational director has, that, you know, we put it down so that we could explore them with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2922.274s">Not</a>  because we necessarily think that they're going to fund all these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2926.256s">We</a>  want to get into an exploratory process to examine what is possible for partnership with state funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2934.261s">And</a>  then we'll merge the documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2936.622s">The</a>  key thing you have to remember is we have to come back to you for the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2940.248s">And</a>  any amount that we're going to spend, you're going to prioritize along with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2944.909s">It's</a>  not going to be the superintendent who makes the final call. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2947.39s">The</a>  superintendent might make a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2949.49s">But</a>  you're going to decide, and the mayor's going to decide, and the school committee's going to decide how much money you're willing to put on the table at any given point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2957.652s">But</a>  knowing what's eligible gives you a leg up on what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2962.754s">And</a>  as far as the percentage goes, I know what other people are getting at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2967.035s">I</a>  know what the relative things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2969.328s">The</a>  state's not going to commit to something before they see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2972.31s">I</a>  know we fall in that basic line of where we would be eligible, because I know what the economics are between the different communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2979.895s">It</a>  doesn't mean that it won't go down a little bit, because obviously the wealth of the community is increasing.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2987.62s">So</a>  Mr. Superintendent, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2990.239s">So</a>  based on the laundry list that we're submitting in the SOI, and it is a laundry list, wouldn't it make more sense for us to prioritize what our needs are so we don't count on or have to count on some state bureaucrat coming back saying, you know what, Method, we know you need a fire alarm system and a sprinkler system and windows and an HVA system, but we're gonna give you a cafeteria for 500 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3015.8s">They're</a>  not gonna do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3017.263s">Mr.</a>  Secretary, we don't know what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3019.865s">But</a>  why not put together a list of what our priorities are and not just put together a list of, it sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3028.212s">You</a>  put everything in there in the kitchen sink and say, hey, look, we're looking to get funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3032.255s">It</a>  sounds great in theory, but it's not practical. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3035.698s">I</a>  don't believe it's practical to put everything in the SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3039.001s">And</a>  I'd rather see, like Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, a list of what our top priorities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3044.31s">and</a>  have them go through our top priorities, Mr. Superintendent, and then make a selection from our top priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3051.451s">And</a>  if a 500 student cafeteria is not on the top of your priority list as superintendent of the school committee's priority list, then that should be at the bottom of the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3063.914s">Or</a>  not on the list at all, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3067.395s">I</a>  hear what you're saying, but I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3070.106s">My</a>  experience tells me in meeting, because I've had these meetings before. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3073.047s">As</a>  you know, we've had science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3074.527s">We've</a>  built new buildings and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3076.128s">My</a>  experience tells me that when we sit down with them, we'll focus in on the things that are high priority first. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3081.67s">And</a>  then we'll look at whether any of these other things are possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3086.331s">But</a>  they know the difference between a firearm system and a roof and a cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3092.693s">They</a>  know the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3093.513s">And</a>  they know where we would like to go first. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3096.354s">This</a>  is an attempt to give everybody, every stakeholder, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3099.648s">who</a>  was involved in the planning process of putting an SOI together, a chance to be heard, rather than say your idea is not worth being explored with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3110.156s">We're</a>  giving them a chance to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3111.957s">But</a>  you know and I know that the state will zero in on firearms and roofs and heating systems long before they worry about the cafeteria.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3121.956s">And</a>  if we were so concerned of having every stakeholder seat at the table, why don't we see the middle school and elementary schools as a separate S.O.I., Mr. Superintendent, which can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3133.06s">I'm</a>  sure you know that as superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3135.32s">There</a>  is no mention about the needs of, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn mentioned, the secondary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3141.659s">within</a>  this, and nor should it be, because this is a high school proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3145.742s">But</a>  there's also proposals that are in need, as you know, in our other schools, in dire need. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3151.865s">So</a>  my question is then, my second question, Mr. President, is the fact that I realize the order which takes place as you submit the SOI, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3165.672s">I</a>  didn't realize after you submit the SOI then you go sit down with the state people. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3169.656s">I</a>  didn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3170.276s">You're</a>  telling me you now then go sit down with the state people and you, what do you do, compromise with them?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3176.702s">No,</a>  you sit down and you go over and they'll tell you what they would consider to be priorities, what they would consider to be something that they would consider to be of concern to them, what they would like to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3187.742s">I</a>  mean, after all, they're accountable to their funding agency and their board as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3192.064s">So</a>  I think that they'd be more interested in a fire alarm system, a roof, heating systems, more so than some of the other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3199.926s">But,</a>  you know, we're giving them all these things, and they might say, you know, we're doing something with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3205.368s">Who</a>  knew a few years ago that they were going to be funding science labs? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3208.909s">But</a>  we put it in front of them, and we got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3212.41s">You</a>  know, you have to try all these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3214.571s">You</a>  put it in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3215.412s">You</a>  say, are you interested in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3216.512s">Could</a>  you consider this to be a reasonable investment? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3220.954s">Maybe</a>  someone's going to say, yes, you know, we've got an interest in this at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3225.357s">So</a>  we're moving forward with a planning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3228.678s">That's</a>  all we're doing tonight, asking you to allow us to go forward proactively and find out what the state wants to prioritize in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3237.863s">And</a>  this is going to take probably two to three years to actually actualize. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3242.48s">In</a>  the meantime, that will inform, you know, our other capital planning that may have to be locally funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3249.667s">And</a>  we will form also our maintenance issues, which will be locally funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3254.612s">So,</a>  and then grant applications we make. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3256.914s">If</a>  someone were to say we can't get grants for this, you know, for example, we built the, we're building the Culinary Arts and Hospitality Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3264.001s">That</a>  wasn't gonna be funded by MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3267.237s">But</a>  we got a grant to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3269.679s">So</a>  we have to know where we have to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3271.46s">We</a>  have to know what's possible under what set of funding and what's possible under other sets of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3276.184s">And</a>  then we can then lay it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3277.665s">And</a>  of course, we're going to have to work with you and the school committee for any kind of local money that's going to be needed to move the project forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3286.086s">This</a>  isn't you say yes tonight, and I go off and do whatever I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3290.327s">This</a>  is you say yes tonight, we get the process going, and then we come back to you and sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3295.048s">And</a>  it should be a robust process, because the city wants to move forward on some good projects, not only in the schools, but in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3302.87s">And</a>  we look forward to that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3305.31s">So</a>  if I could, Mr. Superintendent, I know you're probably not prepared tonight to put a dollar amount onto your deficiency request. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3314.013s">But</a>  you were able to put a dollar amount back <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3316.585s">in</a>  September 2016 on the laundry list of items that you mentioned needed repair at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3323.331s">Are</a>  you prepared tonight to put a dollar amount on your SOI request to the state?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3328.116s">No,</a>  because I don't know, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3330.753s">the</a>  extent to which any of these things would be funded.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3333.534s">But</a>  I do know... Now, I'm not talking about funding.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3336.116s">What</a>  is the actual cost of your SOI request? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3338.717s">You</a>  know, I wouldn't want to, you know, give you a guess right now, because quite frankly, it depends on the extent to which you do them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3346.741s">You</a>  know, and any one of these things might be a partial thing, maybe some windows, maybe some doors, and maybe not all, maybe all doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3355.365s">I</a>  don't think we, you know, we can do that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3357.826s">When</a>  we get back from a planning process, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3360.73s">and</a>  we get to a financial phase, then we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3364.791s">That's</a>  the most prudent way to do it, not to throw speculative numbers out there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3369.532s">And</a>  if people come and say, look, that's too much at any one time, then that'll be too much at any one time.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3374.513s">Okay,</a>  so what you're asking then is the council to let you go forward, and then in deliberations, when you submit your SOI with the state, you'll go back and forth with the state, and they'll determine what projects will be done or approved, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3390.083s">And</a>  if they come back and say, you know what, Method, we like everything in your SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3394.906s">There's</a>  been a lack of requests for school building assistance this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3399.97s">And</a>  we're going to fund you for $60 million, Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3402.992s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3404.413s">And</a>  we're even going to give you half. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3405.574s">We're</a>  going to give you $30 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3408.055s">So</a>  you're going to have to bond for $30 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3410.397s">Are</a>  you prepared to come back to this city, Mr. Superintendent, with a $30 million bond request within the next two to three years?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3418.797s">I'd</a>  be prepared to come back to you to tell you what your options are and to allow you to decide what the finances of this city is willing to support in support of your public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3430.163s">That's</a>  all, just like anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3431.284s">We</a>  come to you with a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3432.365s">We</a>  come to you with other kinds of financial things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3434.726s">You</a>  can tell us how much more you want to put into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3437.608s">But</a>  you know, for example, in five or six years, you're going to replace a roof at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3442.45s">You</a>  are going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3443.731s">The</a>  question is, who's going to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3445.76s">But</a>  if we are eligible to get somebody to share that with us, why not find out now? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3452.083s">You</a>  know that there are some heating things that we want to do at the high school that we should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3457.386s">If</a>  you don't do them in the next few years, you'll end up paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3460.388s">So</a>  we should find out if we have a partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3462.929s">And</a>  so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3464.31s">We</a>  know that technology is moving at a rapid rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3468.072s">And</a>  if we know that it's going to be expensive to increase all the technology that's going to be required of public schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3474.285s">So</a>  if someone's willing to partner with us, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3478.267s">You'll</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3479.567s">That</a>  gives you those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3480.648s">But</a>  you can decide that, you know, I'm not interested in a performing arts center, and I'm not interested in an expanded cafeteria, and I don't really care about some other things you're interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3489.672s">So</a>  even though someone's willing to partner with us, it's off the table for Medford because we have other things we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3496.474s">My</a>  job is to give you options. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3498.475s">My</a>  job is to give you an opportunity to look at it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3501.256s">And</a>  who's going to make that decision? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3503.085s">So</a>  let's just say, in a perfect scenario, the state comes back and said, Medford, we're giving you everything you wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3508.387s">Who</a>  ultimately is going to make that decision? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3509.968s">Are</a>  you saying it's this council that's going to sit there? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3512.388s">School</a>  committee, mayor, and council are the arbiters of dollars and cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3517.47s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3517.73s">But</a>  we ultimately have the final funding say, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3522.212s">So</a>  you think this council is going to sit back after the SOI is put in, and if everything works out perfectly, and they come to us and they pay for half, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3530.613s">And</a>  we're getting everything we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3532.633s">You</a>  think the city council is going to sit here and start slashing different items in the budget to make sure that we don't have a proposition two and a half override? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3544.296s">Is</a>  that what you expect this council to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3546.377s">That's</a>  my questioning, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3548.717s">Why</a>  are we throwing everything at the wall when we know what deficiencies we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3552.981s">we</a>  should prioritize them right now and move forward on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3556.023s">This</a>  program is going nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3557.724s">So</a>  to make people believe that, hey, that's, you know, let's get a partner today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3561.667s">We</a>  can get a partner today, tomorrow, next year, the year after this program has been around for years and we've taken advantage for many, many years, Mr. Superintendent, you know, uh, we, we got, uh, for a core program, uh, 59.79%. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3573.915s">Um,</a>  uh, it doesn't give the year 2008, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3581.095s">Then</a>  the science labs, we've got 59%, $6 million reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3586.399s">Then</a>  the accelerated repair, $2,409,000, they gave us a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3592.344s">So</a>  I know we've been great partners with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3595.587s">My</a>  concern is eventually, because I've been on this council a number of years, is that eventually the issue's gonna come back before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3603.453s">And</a>  we're gonna be the ones that are gonna be sitting there saying, geez, you know what, the state wants to give us all this money, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3609.819s">but</a>  the city council doesn't want to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3612.622s">They</a>  want to pay half of this and this and this, but they don't want to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3616.147s">And</a>  we know what the purse strings are, Mr. Superintendent, when we hear from the mayor three weeks ago, say that she can't afford to do a combined center for police and fire, because according to her and the treasurer collector, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3629.588s">that</a>  the school bonds will be coming offline in the year 2022, which is five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3635.952s">And</a>  she said we can't afford the spending that we want to do for a combined center until 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3641.955s">Now</a>  you're telling us that this project they could be looking for funding maybe two or three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3647.298s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3648.619s">Well,</a>  what I'm telling you is I'm telling you it'll take two to three years to get through the process to actually get <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3654.18s">construction</a>  going on something, any project that gets approved and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3657.941s">But</a>  we won't even get to design feasibility and design until we come back here and talk about what the state is interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3665.964s">And</a>  in the feasibility period, that's when you will make some decisions before we actually go forward with a final number. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3674.166s">I</a>  mean, the reality is that some things will be done over five years, some things may be done over 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3679.783s">The</a>  reality is to find out what we can get some funding for and what we can get support for.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3684.67s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3685.451s">And</a>  that is the reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3686.453s">And</a>  that's why I'm bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3688.015s">There</a>  is a reality behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3690.259s">And</a>  when I hear from the administration and the treasurer-collector saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3693.57s">that</a>  we can't afford any more bonds other than what we just did for the police department until the year 2022, unless we want to look at a Prop 2.5 override, I think every member of this council and every citizen should be concerned about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3707.076s">And</a>  we should have a handle on what we're potentially looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3710.878s">And</a>  from what you're telling me now, the process is you just submit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3714.239s">You</a>  really don't know what the dollar amount will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3716.52s">You</a>  just submit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3717.641s">You</a>  hope for the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3719.141s">And</a>  when it comes back, it comes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3721.21s">And</a>  then at that point, you look at the financials. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3723.851s">And</a>  what I'm telling you is, the mayor just told us three weeks ago, we're looking at five years down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3730.092s">And</a>  that doesn't seem what we're looking for for these schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3733.893s">I</a>  mean, I read the SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3734.974s">It</a>  says an SOI should only be filed for a facility where a district has the ability to gain the proper local approvals and to fund a project in the next two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3746.054s">So</a>  they're putting, you know, they want to see commitment, that's why they're asking for a vote, the school committee and the council, and they want to see a funding commitment.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3755.285s">And</a>  we're at such an early stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3757.688s">I</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3759.35s">And</a>  quite frankly, look, you get hit with a lot of decisions that require you to make tough decisions on money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3765.341s">on</a>  policies, on zoning, on any number of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3769.104s">You</a>  can't hide from, not that you want to, from making tough decisions that make some people happy and some people less happy.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3775.549s">With</a>  all due respect, you just stated that you put things in this SOI that you didn't want in there because you were hiding from dealing with other people at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3784.817s">So</a>  don't say people are hiding, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3786.638s">I</a>  said I respected the right of the planning team to forward things <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3792.927s">that</a>  I consider to be, that they consider to be important to them, because I want to respect my administrative team and the teachers and others who participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3800.569s">You're</a>  the educational leader of this community, Mr. Superintendent, and sometimes you have to make the tough decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3805.531s">And</a>  I like the participation of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3807.111s">I</a>  don't have to make all the decisions myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3809.852s">But</a>  the reality is that nothing is going to go forward financially unless you decide you can afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3815.947s">Nothing's</a>  going to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3816.868s">We're</a>  trying to explore who wants to partner with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3821.31s">And</a>  you know that the most important things will be systems that are important to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3826.153s">The</a>  operation of the building will get higher priority than some of the things that maybe are aspirational. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3832.397s">You</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3833.737s">So</a>  if you decide that certain things aren't something you want to fund, then you say, well, put that off for a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3840.304s">But</a>  certainly, you're going to face a roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3842.486s">Certainly,</a>  you're going to face technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3844.448s">Certainly,</a>  you're going to deal with other systems, heating systems and other things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3848.291s">And</a>  if we don't get in the game now, it'll be longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3852.833s">before</a>  we get funding, and if we don't, and if the funding dries up because of the Commonwealth not being able to keep things moving, you see the green line, other things like that, we talk about these things, and it keeps getting pushed off, keeps getting pushed off. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3866.035s">Let's</a>  get in the game, and then you can decide whether or not it's something you desire as a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3872.016s">That's</a>  what we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3873.577s">I</a>  think it's my job to put it in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3875.797s">I</a>  hope it's your job to, or I hope it's your willingness to let me find out what's possible going forward.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3883.339s">So</a>  Mr. Superintendent, just getting back to some of the building deficiencies, would you agree that the restrooms at the high school are a deficiency of Medford High School?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3893.566s">I</a>  would agree that restrooms are something that should be addressed, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3898.75s">How</a>  come they're not part of the SOI? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3900.271s">Because</a>  they're part of the general building envelope. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3902.452s">That's</a>  something that we can talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3903.873s">They're</a>  part of the plumbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3905.134s">They're</a>  part of the heating system, believe it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3907.295s">It's</a>  all part of the same consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3909.91s">And</a>  just because something isn't written here doesn't mean we can't talk about it with the team that comes out from MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3916.895s">If</a>  we think of other things, we can say, you know, by the way, we'd like you to look at this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3921.017s">This</a>  is to get them, to give them an idea of which communities are interested in seeking partnership with the state.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3929.563s">So</a>  just so I understand, you brought up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3932.945s">So</a>  after the April 7th deadline, you're stating that we can add stuff to the SOI? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3937.828s">We</a>  can talk to them about it, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3939.807s">Not</a>  talk, we can add stuff after the deadline.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3942.871s">We</a>  can talk stuff, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3944.774s">We</a>  can talk with them about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3945.815s">Maybe</a>  they'll let us add, maybe they won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3947.678s">But</a>  I'm sure they would consider some of the things that we would bring up.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3952.061s">With</a>  all due respect, Mr. Superintendent, I've been an advocate for a number of years regarding the cleanliness and the deplorable condition of the bathrooms at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3963.972s">And</a>  there's been some headway made, I have to give credit, there's been some headway made with the water bubbles and so forth, but many of the restrooms at the high school are locked down, not because we don't have the manpower to supervise them, it's because they're in deplorable condition, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3980.008s">And</a>  this is coming from first-hand knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3983.391s">And</a>  I can tell you that the fact that it's not addressed in a deficiency in this program and say, well, it's covered under other things, I think is not adequately addressing the deficiencies that we have at that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3996.22s">It</a>  may not be educational in nature, but what I can tell you is that there are kids at the high school that will hold <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4002.986s">and</a>  going to the restroom a whole day because they're so filthy dirty and you can't get toilet paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4008.671s">There's</a>  no soap. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4009.632s">There's</a>  no paper towels. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4011.795s">There's</a>  no doors on the urinals. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4013.937s">And</a>  I'm just telling you reality, Mr. Superintendent, because you have your own private bathroom and probably don't frequent other restrooms in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4021.404s">And</a>  I could just tell you that from what I hear from students, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4025.228s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, is that's what's happening up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4028.43s">And</a>  I'm saddened to see that it's not addressed in the SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4032.412s">But</a>  if you're telling me it could be added at a later date, that's fine, and I hope it does get added, because that would be my addition.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4039.976s">I</a>  guess I'm a stakeholder. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4041.096s">That</a>  would be my addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4042.157s">I</a>  certainly would bring that up in any kind of discussion, but I can tell you that I don't share your full assessment of our bathroom facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4049.741s">There</a>  may be a few that need some additional work, but there's a lot of them that work very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4054.182s">They're</a>  in good shape and are being cleaned on a regular basis.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4056.344s">That's</a>  my exact point. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4058.185s">I</a>  know you don't share them and that's why they've been in deplorable condition for so many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4062.669s">That's</a>  my exact point, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4066.152s">So</a>  we can go back and forth on that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4069.335s">And</a>  also, Mr. Superintendent, you were here several months back when we were talking about safety at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4075.821s">We</a>  had a great debate going back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4078.683s">and</a>  I see you mentioned in the SOI that you have the inability to close off certain parts of the building and have the inability to keep it cordoned off to people from outside and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4092.01s">I'm</a>  glad to see that you're finally admitting that there is a security issue at the high school and that there is concern, Mr. Superintendent, with access to that building throughout the course of the day and that we've been unable to control the access <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4108.285s">And</a>  I'm glad to see that you're offering some solutions to that effect, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4113.546s">So</a>  for the record, I'm going to tell you the high school is a safe place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4117.167s">There's</a>  always more we can do to improve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4120.508s">And</a>  some of the things we have here will add dimensions that we can't do by ourselves.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4131.691s">That's</a>  all for now, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4133.431s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4135.812s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4136.892s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4138.772s">President</a>  Caraviello, I think it's important that we do, as a group, as a city council, understand what the immediate needs are, a five-year plan, and I think, that was my question in the beginning, and it's not really answered, and I have to review on this in depth, it does seem like everything is included, but when you stated that when the state comes in, you will let them know what the priorities are, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4167.248s">I</a>  would just request through the chair that we do get a top five, top 10 list of things that need to be done and maybe why they need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4177.751s">Nothing</a>  extensive, just the first thing we would need is a, just so we could better understand what those 10 things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4185.573s">If</a>  the state is going to give us money, I think the city council, who will have to agree or disagree to bond for it, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4194.47s">should</a>  know that up front before we submit something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4198.573s">I</a>  think that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4199.774s">Number</a>  two, I just agree with Councilor Marks in the respect with regards to putting everything in the kitchen sink into this document, because we were told that we can't afford a fire station until 2022, 23, 24, and the fire department was also promised to be almost the next on the list <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4223.4s">So</a>  the administration told us that we can't afford probably a number of these larger items unless it's, you know, obviously a substantial need like a leaking roof or a blown boiler. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4236.903s">So</a>  I would hate to have one of these larger projects that is not necessarily a necessity be approved and us be given a grant and then we come and see 500 students here advocating for <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4251.458s">that</a>  500-person cafeteria or something that's almost a novelty that we can't afford and then have 75 firefighters in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4258.4s">But</a>  wait, saying wait, we were promised a new station, a healthy, safe environment for us to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4265.282s">And</a>  that's the way politics runs in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4267.423s">It's</a>  not going to be up to all the elected body. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4271.004s">How</a>  it's worked is it's going to come before the council to take that tough vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4275.846s">So</a>  whether or not, I think this needs to be narrowed down just a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4280.401s">Because</a>  I understand both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4281.961s">I</a>  understand you want to include everything your staff and administration wants in the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4286.502s">But</a>  it's a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4287.722s">We</a>  can't afford all these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4289.703s">And</a>  what we should be able to afford are the necessities, health, safety, and obviously the security within that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4297.785s">And</a>  that should be what's in this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4299.765s">And</a>  that's what I'd be comfortable approving tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4303.126s">And</a>  you would have my approval if it was narrowed down a little bit to maybe the top 10 items that need to be done at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4310.489s">and</a>  then we can do the necessities, do things that need to be done within the next five, six, seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4317.673s">So</a>  I mean, I agree, and I think that's some, those are two points, two things maybe that I think we should have before us, maybe a little updated document, a little less extravagant, and then also just a top 10 list of what needs to be done, what we're gonna need to do within the next five to 10 years, so that we can say, yes, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4340.622s">good</a>  request, and then see what the state is willing to give us, because we cannot afford, we were told we cannot afford 10 extra million now, and we won't be able to afford it until we do the fire station, and then at that point, we won't be able to afford a library, and basically what I heard is we won't be able to afford a lot of these items in this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4361.297s">So</a>  I'd rather ask for, hey, state, please, we need a roof, we need a new electrical system in A building, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4369.093s">These</a>  things are going to, obviously, we need them evaluated, and they're going to fall apart, or are going to have to be replaced within the next five to 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4376.816s">And</a>  I would ask the council to really think about that, because that's a situation we're going to face, or whoever's sitting behind this rail, four, five, three years from now, if we do get the monies for an extravagant item that we just really can't afford, that the kids are going to want so badly, and the administration's going to want. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4395.184s">But</a>  will they need it, and will we be able to afford it? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4398.486s">And</a>  we were told, no, it's not going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4400.286s">So</a>  let's, I think we need to be a little bit more realistic.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4405.367s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4406.847s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4408.268s">I</a>  think we're getting the cut way, way, way ahead of the horse here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4413.148s">If</a>  we look at the history of the Medford City Council, just several weeks ago, we voted unanimously for the administration to hire a grant writer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4420.03s">Before</a>  us right here, we have a grant that's been written and an opportunity to let the school department go and explore options and opportunities for the city to be given free money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4429.992s">I</a>  don't think that's a bad thing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4432.154s">We</a>  get elected to make tough decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4434.315s">And</a>  if there comes a point in time when there's a room full of students and a room full of firefighters that are sitting here arguing about whose project is going to get funded, I think that everybody behind this rail is committed to the understanding that public safety is our first priority, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4446.965s">But</a>  we will be the ones that have to make that tough decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4449.487s">But</a>  that's what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4452.369s">Ultimately,</a>  Mr. President, all this is, is the school district seeking permission to go and sit down and have a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4460.302s">That's</a>  what this is, the school district sitting down to have a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4463.585s">As</a>  such, Mr. President, I've made a motion to move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4465.827s">I</a>  make a motion to end all debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4467.568s">Move</a>  the question.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4622.838s">Mr.</a>  President, I had the floor before that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4625.121s">No,</a>  Councilor Dullos, you...

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4643.413s">I</a>  do, mister, I have a question for the superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4645.434s">Speak.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4645.574s">Are</a>  we here tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4646.474s">Speak.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4646.974s">To</a>  discuss, the superintendent came up here, took his time out of his busy schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4650.096s">No</a>  one's denying you an opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4652.917s">We're</a>  just trying to deny freedom of speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4654.478s">I</a>  was not trying to deny you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4655.978s">The</a>  people, the board spoke, and you were able to speak.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4659.119s">The</a>  board spoke is right, and I'm thankful for my colleagues that know what this legislative process is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4664.722s">You</a>  have the floor, Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4666.042s">I</a>  know I do, thank you, keep them interrupting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4670.304s">And</a>  I wanna thank my colleagues, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4673.197s">that</a>  had the gumption, Mr. President, to allow this dialogue to keep going on and not be rubber stamps. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4682.882s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, are you willing to put together a priority list, as Councilor Wendell Kern mentioned, in the SOI? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4690.446s">It</a>  seems like this is an ongoing, fluid discussion with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4694.508s">Are</a>  you willing to do that?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4696.469s">I</a>  think that the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4698.847s">would</a>  meet to talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4700.467s">And</a>  we could sit together, because I'm not going to speak solely for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4705.408s">They</a>  have a right to determine what they would consider priorities within this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4710.389s">And</a>  they're not going to meet for another two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4712.69s">And</a>  so I think that that slows this down. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4714.85s">This</a>  is due in a very short period of time into the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4718.671s">And</a>  I think that we can always send you a priority list afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4722.451s">But</a>  the things we would prioritize in our discussions with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4726.567s">But</a>  I think you should allow us to go forward and to get this going. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4730.749s">I</a>  mean, it doesn't hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4731.769s">You're</a>  not committing anything in terms of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4735.351s">You're</a>  just allowing us to submit an application to the state so that we can be heard with their team that evaluates issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4744.915s">And</a>  they won't even get to us for a couple of months, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4748.697s">They</a>  won't even get to us for a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4751.038s">But</a>  having said that, we have to be in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4753.999s">Because</a>  there are other communities going to submit as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4756.742s">And</a>  if we're not in, we don't get any consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4760.185s">So</a>  I think I'll be happy to bring that up with the school committee to give you some sort of what they consider priorities within this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4768.35s">But</a>  I don't think you should stop it tonight.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4771.012s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4773.034s">And</a>  I don't think anyone behind this reeling, and I'll speak for myself, was looking to stop this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4778.658s">We</a>  were looking to ask questions, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4781.72s">And</a>  that's not confused questioning with being in opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4786.347s">It's</a>  part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4788.509s">It's</a>  part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4789.469s">I</a>  know this is an early step, and it's the first step, and now we're hearing April 7th is the deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4794.934s">No</a>  surprise, not for you, but no surprise to this council, because we're always presented with, oh, the deadline's next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4802.039s">Make</a>  a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4803.38s">You</a>  can't table it for a week, because the deadline's next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4806.523s">So</a>  we're always presented that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4808.524s">But</a>  I'm not going to stand in the way of this tonight, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4811.947s">I</a>  think what Councilor Lungo-Koehn offered <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4813.907s">about</a>  going back, and if you need to go back to the school committee and get a priority list, I think that's a great suggestion, Mr. Superintendent, to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4822.053s">And</a>  I would ask that that be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4824.035s">And</a>  I would also ask that this council be privy to any discussions that you are having with the state regarding projects, of which projects may be taken off the board, which projects may be added to the SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4838.613s">So</a>  we're up to date and not just presented something on the last hour again for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4844.538s">And</a>  I would ask that you keep this council privy to that information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4850.143s">I</a>  certainly have no problem with any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4851.965s">I</a>  think, you know, look, let's not kid ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4854.607s">Any</a>  project to go forward needs a school committee, needs the mayor, needs the city council, and needs the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4861.792s">So</a>  there's a lot of deliberation that's going to have to take place and a lot of prioritization that's going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4867.357s">But</a>  if you're only asking me to go back to the school committee and sit down and ask them to tell you what's most important to them, happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4874.463s">I</a>  think that that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4876.845s">But</a>  I don't think we should stop getting in on the <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4882.215s">into</a>  the state with this so we can continue to move and get them to come out to us sooner rather than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4887.096s">Because</a>  everybody's going to be submitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4889.576s">And</a>  if we're the last one in the door, maybe our review date doesn't happen until August, September, October, whatever the case may be.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4898.298s">I</a>  was told, just so you know, there's no priority according to when the SOI is received. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4902.899s">So</a>  whether the last one in the door, first one in the door, second one in the door, I was also told that they're not going to look at applications or make any recommendations until December. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4911.85s">of</a>  2017, so there's plenty of time, and I'm just asking that we be part of any discussions that are ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4919.482s">You</a>  will have my support here tonight, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4922.971s">I</a>  could just tell you eventually, and as a longtime member of this council, eventually when something comes before us, whether it's a year, two or three years before us, and if it does, if and when it does require, maybe require a proposition two and a half override, you will not have my support. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4941.8s">And</a>  I just want to let that be known right now because I'm not going to hold back any punches. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4947.914s">You</a>  know, I voted not to have the combined center because we were told that it would require a proposition two and a half override for the police and fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4958.058s">And,</a>  you know, we have a library coming down the pike pretty soon with some grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4963.921s">We're</a>  going to have this project, and eventually we're going to have the fire department coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4967.662s">So</a>  I would just ask that whatever's done, that it stay within the confines of our budget without a proposition two and a half override.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4977.693s">I</a>  respect your right to make those decisions, and, you know, I understand them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4981.975s">I</a>  mean, I'm not a rookie. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4983.736s">I've</a>  been here a long time, and I've been in and out of these meetings many times, asking for funding and other forms of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4991.28s">So</a>  I respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4993.181s">But</a>  it's important that you know your options, and that's all I'm asking you to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4996.983s">Know</a>  your options.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5000.625s">Counsel</a>  Max, are you finished? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5001.745s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5003.686s">Counsel</a>  De La Rosa.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5005.947s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5008.155s">And</a>  thank you, Mr. Superintendent, for your leadership and your clarity and your foresight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5014.457s">The</a>  way I understand this request, it is to get us, as you've presented, into the door and to have items for discussion on the table for us to see what can be funded and what we can receive help with. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5027.622s">I'm</a>  all in favor of a priority list from the school board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5033.304s">My</a>  concern with priority lists from anybody is that they be responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5038.203s">and</a>  that they have in mind a larger picture that though this body makes the final decision that we all share a responsibility in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5052.248s">I</a>  approve of this request and I will support it, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5057.35s">I</a>  must say that I hope that when we get into further discussion on how or <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5064.133s">in</a>  what way some of this money and some of these grants might be directed, that we're able to address some of the money that we've spent in the past on the same thing several times. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5079.837s">It</a>  seems as though we're chasing leaks in those roofs and replacing them and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on those roofs in a frequent manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5090.14s">I'm</a>  concerned about that, and I hope we can get to the bottom of the top of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5095.544s">And</a>  so I think I've said enough, and I think perhaps we've heard enough tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5101.589s">And</a>  so I'd like to move approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5104.751s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5105.652s">Mr.</a>  President, just one quick thing to counsel, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5109.194s">Just</a>  that we did an infrared study of the high school roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5112.757s">We</a>  will repair those things that need to be repaired for about $25,000 this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5118.201s">OK,</a>  that's about all we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5120.179s">The</a>  long-term renovation or repair or reconstruction of the roof is five to six years out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5127.365s">And,</a>  you know, if we were to take it to the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5129.747s">So</a>  that's really where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5131.908s">We</a>  had a couple of very difficult snow periods a few years ago where shoveling was required on the roof to avoid collapse and the like that may have done some damage in certain areas, and we need to repair those. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5143.658s">But</a>  other than that, the roof's got another five, six years.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5146.54s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5148.081s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5149.943s">Mr.</a>  Caraviello, through the chair, I just want to ask for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5152.885s">So</a>  we're asking for a priority list and we're asking, I mean, I guess it would be a good compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5158.569s">Are</a>  we asking to keep the document as is and then put the priority list in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5163.672s">Did</a>  you state that, Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5165.434s">Put</a>  the priority list within the application? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5172.578s">I</a>  thought I heard you say that it will be within the document.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5175.625s">We</a>  could put in the document, or the superintendent says he sits down and meets with the state, so I have no problem with him presenting the priority list. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5183.548s">So</a>  it doesn't, I don't care about the avenue it gets to the state.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5188.229s">Okay,</a>  yeah, I just would like to add that, that our priority list that is drafted within the next week or two, even be added as an attachment to the application, so that the state knows, yes, we're looking for everything, but these are our top, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5204.678s">whatever</a>  it might be, 10, 11, 12 things that we need done within the next five to 10 years that we're going to be putting money forward anyway for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5211.742s">And</a>  we would love some state reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5215.404s">I</a>  think that I'd just like to add that to the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5218.265s">And</a>  I'd also like to just point out that I think I heard that this document maybe was produced in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5223.888s">And</a>  I think the school committee voted on it on the 6th of February, which was a month and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5228.871s">And</a>  for some reason, it came before us tonight with only a week or two left before it's actually due. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5234.696s">So</a>  in the future, it would be nice to, obviously the school committee has the right to review and to discuss first, but a little bit sooner so that maybe we could prepare a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5245.14s">We</a>  got it on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5246.201s">I</a>  think a lot of us review our packet over the weekend, leaving us only a couple days to form questions, do research, make calls, and get the questions we want answered before we have to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5255.685s">And</a>  it always just feels, not just, no offense to the superintendent, but no matter what we're presented, half the time, especially if it's something important, we're giving it <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5264.689s">the</a>  week of and it's just not the right way to run a city and to be transparent with not only us as the people who are elected to make the votes, but to the people who are electing us who are going to come and ask us the questions or who asks us the questions after they hear the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5281.18s">So</a>  I think just think in the future and I'll say that all the time and whether or not it happens, highly unlikely, but I think it's extremely important to be more transparent and to give the city council more time for review.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5294.208s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5294.588s">So</a>  Mr. President, if I could just respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5296.87s">I</a>  mean, I feel I have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5298.611s">The</a>  document you're referring to in September was a different document. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5301.532s">That's</a>  the capital plan that came from the mayor through the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5305.315s">The</a>  document you have in front of you was approved by the school committee on February 6th after a committee of the whole meeting that they had the week before on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5314.96s">And</a>  you received it, what do you call it, tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5318.879s">because,</a>  what do you call it, you were busy dealing with other capital considerations, in particular the police station and other things like that, so they confused those two items. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5326.95s">But</a>  the reality is that that's the two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5330.315s">And</a>  the other point I guess I would make is that the state has a form. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5334.731s">We</a>  filled out the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5336.132s">You</a>  don't add to the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5337.994s">We'll</a>  be happy to provide that priority list to them, but the form is the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5342.678s">That's</a>  what you submit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5344.079s">You</a>  don't add things to an application that is not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5347.782s">I</a>  think that would be not consistent with the way you make a submittal. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5355.388s">But</a>  certainly, we respect the right that the council has asked, and we certainly will honor that, to come up with a priority list, provide it to you, and provide it to MSBA, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5364.367s">as</a>  part of the discussions that take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5366.888s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5367.288s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5368.548s">I</a>  would, uh, my point was to be, uh, in support of that priority list attachment in so much as it, uh, it doesn't act as a hindrance or as an appropriate in that forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5381.172s">I,</a>  uh, trust that the superintendent, uh, through the process of meetings, uh, with the authority and, uh, his presence and his negotiating skills won't lead us to be bamboozled.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5395.019s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor DelaRosso. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5397.22s">And</a>  Mr. Superintendent, I thank you for your leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5399.602s">Our</a>  technical school and high school has moved forward in the last few years under your guidance, and I hope to see it continue moving forward.</p>
