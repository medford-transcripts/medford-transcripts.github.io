    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=26.91s">President</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=27.891s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=29.111s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=31.753s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=45.942s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=47.932s">Motion</a>  to suspend the rules to take paper off the table.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=49.793s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo to suspend the rules to take what paper, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=54.936s">17-075,</a>  third reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=57.217s">17-075,</a>  which would be the third reading for the law and order for the Newton Police Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=67.723s">Is</a>  the paper before us? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=69.044s">The</a>  paper is now before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=70.885s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=72.466s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo for approval, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=77.797s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Kramer.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=78.977s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=81.318s">I</a>  know before we took the first reading on this paper, we had discussed, and I think it was voted six to one, to take the next three months, along with the administration, to review and discuss cost analysis with regards to a potential dual station and discuss a number of different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=103.677s">people's</a>  concerns with regards to the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=106.48s">So</a>  I wanted to see if we were going to schedule a meeting with the mayor on that before we.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=111.945s">The</a>  mayor did not respond to our resolution that I know of. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=116.409s">I</a>  haven't seen it in any of my packages. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=118.011s">I</a>  haven't either.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=119.092s">I</a>  haven't seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=120.833s">So</a>  I don't know what the council wants to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=124.877s">I</a>  just feel like that was a strong six to one vote with regards to <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=130.16s">looking</a>  into, and now I believe the fire station, I'm not sure, doesn't have any heat, and that's been going on, I think since the snowstorm, I was getting reports that there was no heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=140.704s">So</a>  I think it's pretty pertinent to, for at least a discussion, even if it's next week, we have a discussion on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=147.346s">And</a>  I don't know if it's worth putting this off a week and seeing if we can get a response from the mayor's office on that resolution, but it was a strong six to one vote, and a number of people were in this audience in support of <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=160.637s">looking</a>  into a cost analysis and getting some numbers together, better than what we were provided, so we can really see if we can't afford the dual station and get a better idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=171.721s">I</a>  know a number of things were thrown around and certain contradictions were made a few weeks back, so I think some more clarity is in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=181.884s">I</a>  don't know how my colleagues feel.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=188.562s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=189.082s">I</a>  second the motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=191.864s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=199.89s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=201.131s">My</a>  name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=204.433s">I'm</a>  a former member of the Saugus Party. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=207.235s">I</a>  can appreciate what Councilor Lungelkorn is going to because apparently, I think folks, as I was speaking to them today, were led to believe it was going to be next Tuesday evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=215.888s">And</a>  here we are, we have nobody here from the fire department or the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=222.569s">But</a>  if you go back and look at your capital improvement plan that was offered by the mayor, there's quite a few locations and suggestions in here that raised itself well over two and a half million dollars as to where and how this is going to be funded as it relates to the fire station and into the police station part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=241.093s">You</a>  know, a lot of people don't even realize what just took place on the 14th of March <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=246.884s">the</a>  day of the storm, the unfortunate circumstance down the fire department and the police department, their generator went out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=253.369s">Their</a>  backup generator to be supportive of their police operations, their telecommunications, their communications back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=261.034s">From</a>  what I understand and I believe it to be true, one if not maybe two of the doors of the fire department couldn't even be open because they had no electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=270.3s">And</a>  their backup generator, which apparently wasn't serviced like it should have been serviced, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=274.458s">was</a>  out for a couple of days and they had to wait for a pot, and that's all because of what took place with the storm. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=280.543s">You</a>  really have a whole host of issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=283.124s">You</a>  talk about a $2 billion seismic study for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=288.048s">None</a>  of you have gone through the reading of the over 690 pages of the $110,000 report that was written in January, submitted in January of 2013. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=296.915s">You're</a>  going to be having here <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=301.613s">a</a>  little later this evening, because I see the superintendent here, and you're going to be having a discussion on something that relates to the high school in multi-millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=309.376s">And</a>  you really need to ask the same question. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=310.857s">You're</a>  going to have a seismic erratic study for that piece of property up there, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=315.018s">You</a>  know, I think it's unfair to the Medford taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=318.179s">Just</a>  like you folks, I am a taxpayer here in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=321.981s">The</a>  building was built in 1962. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=325.542s">Same</a>  thing with the high school, honor about in that same year of category. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=329.026s">And</a>  they're looking for a major, major overhaul, if not reconstruction or additions to whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=336.754s">But</a>  the question really needs to be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=338.796s">It's</a>  obvious that maintenance has not taken place in these buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=342.228s">You,</a>  Councilor Caraviello, if you remember correctly, I think it was your first term, the beginning of your first term, you indicated that the all new schools at that point in time, which are 11 years old, was a million point one in arrears for fixtures. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=352.994s">And</a>  now it's still well in excess of a million, if not a million two, whatever it might be, 15 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=357.737s">And</a>  you don't want to get caught into the same trap that you got caught in before to buy and fix new schools, whether you go from 12 to three or whatever the amount was. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=365.662s">You</a>  built new schools because the old ones weren't maintained. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=368.743s">And</a>  you're going to be looking at the same argument that's going to be presenting itself <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=371.999s">as</a>  it relates to the high school later on this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=374.6s">But</a>  this is too important of an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=376.881s">You're</a>  talking about at the outset $22 million, $2 million for the alleged, I don't know where that dollar amount came from because I don't think any of you can answer how she came up with $2 million, and $20 million to pay for the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=389.168s">And</a>  as you heard here a couple of weeks ago when you had the director of finance up here, they're talking about 2022 before anything might be eligible for expiration of bonds that would be needed to pay for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=400.842s">So</a>  I think in all fairness, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to, there's no reason to jump into this thing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=408.106s">You've</a>  waited a long period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=410.687s">You</a>  haven't even satisfied the argument of where the training center would go and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=415.469s">And</a>  if we remember correctly, I think it was <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=417.657s">When</a>  the first reading took place, because the fire department were here in mass numbers, the mayor decided to include them in any future development as to where they might go. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=427.607s">To</a>  this date, the police department or its union have yet to be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=432.692s">And</a>  you folks have yet to be involved in any type of involvement with this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=436.496s">And</a>  it just doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=438.417s">It's</a>  not good political sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=439.919s">It's</a>  absolutely not good financial sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=442.949s">You</a>  know, you have over $28 million in the deficit in your pension system. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=446.931s">You</a>  have an application, as you're well aware of, Mr. President, before the Massachusetts Library Association for $20 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=453.094s">And</a>  if that comes through, the city of Medford pays 40% of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=456.295s">And</a>  you're looking at probably approximately over the next two or three years, if in fact the high school goes forward and gets its application approved with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=465.49s">$25</a>  million there of taxpayers' money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=468.194s">You're</a>  looking at a fire station and a police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=471.359s">Can</a>  you please tell me who's going to pay for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=474.564s">This</a>  is nothing more than a leading to Proposition 2.5 override. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=478.53s">And</a>  if you look at your sister city of Somerville, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=480.913s">With</a>  all the development that has taken place over there, they have still raised their taxes on two, a single two and three family homes, which goes to prove and tell you that development for the sake of development is not always in the best interest of this community or any community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=497.186s">You</a>  really need to look at the long-term approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=500.175s">And</a>  the long-term approach right now would say, one more week, I don't think, is going to make a big thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=505.537s">And</a>  you know, you're people all talking about transparency and being fluid and having this conversation with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=512.78s">Well,</a>  where is there all a branch extended to you to sit down and discuss and talk with you about this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=518.663s">It's</a>  not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=519.863s">It's</a>  not there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=521.084s">And</a>  what you're doing is the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=523.785s">And</a>  what you're doing, you're just accelerating the use and the argument <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=528.832s">to</a>  have more people run for this city council and to run for mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=533.138s">Because</a>  people are sick and tired and fed, and fed up of being told about all these expenses and not being a part of it, not being included. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=540.948s">And</a>  the council, likewise, not including them in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=544.958s">You're</a>  not talking about $100,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=547.059s">You're</a>  talking about $22 million right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=550.222s">$2</a>  million for the study, $20 million allegedly for the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=554.685s">None</a>  of you can explain how it's going to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=557.246s">None</a>  of you can explain how she got to the $2 million seismographic study. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=560.689s">You</a>  don't even know if an RFQ went out, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=564.151s">I</a>  think the move is wrong tonight if you vote for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=566.993s">That</a>  sends the wrong message. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=568.634s">And</a>  it's definitely, definitely not taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=571.176s">People</a>  are police department friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=573.922s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=574.642s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=577.844s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=581.945s">I</a>  would, with due respect, with regards to the resolve that was approved several weeks back, that we sit down and discuss this in more depth and ask the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=594.211s">I</a>  mean, like I said before, the headquarters building went down last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=599.153s">The</a>  backup generator went down. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=601.054s">There</a>  are a whole host of issues within that whole building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=604.334s">And</a>  when we're talking, I mean, the last speaker just hit the nail on the head. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=610.377s">We're</a>  talking about potential library, promised new fire station somewhere between 2022 and 2025, Medford High School potential updates, and maintenance of the rest of our schools and city buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=625.283s">I</a>  think we need to be on the same page and not just, I mean, I feel like <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=629.587s">This</a>  was so reactive, we need to be on the same page. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=632.889s">And</a>  I would ask that we table this for one week to sit down with the mayor before we vote on it or potentially vote on it next Tuesday so we can hash some things out.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=656.896s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=658.536s">I</a>  remember the vote that Council Lungo-Koehn is speaking about, and it was a 6 to 1 vote requesting that we meet with the administration, in particular the mayor, and discuss not only the building of the police department, also the feasibility and capital improvement plan of where we're going for future projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=681.984s">And</a>  as we'll hear tonight, we have the superintendent of schools here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=685.527s">And</a>  we're going to hear about a need for improvements within the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=690.53s">As</a>  was mentioned by Councilor Longo, we already know the public library is in need of some repairs or total rehab. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=699.537s">And</a>  there are a number of other issues, Mr. President, that I'm sure will be addressed when the superintendent gets up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=705.861s">But</a>  we should have a master plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=708.868s">And</a>  I know Councilor Falco has spoken about a master plan in the past and I've raised the issue to give at least a direction on where we're going to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=718.039s">And</a>  we can't continue to operate and do business with the mayor's draft proposal of a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=725.207s">It's</a>  not even a capital plan, it's a draft proposal that the mayor is still working from. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=730.247s">And</a>  many of the issues in the draft proposal are not present in the letter that she wrote on March 17th to this council stating what the public schools needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=741.038s">needs</a>  are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=742.099s">So</a>  I'm not quite sure, Mr. President, where all this dialogue and debate is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=747.461s">It's</a>  probably happening in a vacuum in the mayor's office, but it's clearly not with the elected officials in this community and with the general public in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=755.665s">And</a>  I would agree, I think one week is not too long to wait to get some feedback on where we're going with the capital plan, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=765.71s">And</a>  as the council president, I think you should be wary of <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=769.922s">the</a>  fact that we're receiving things piecemeal again, and we've stated in the past that we refuse to do business like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=777.005s">I</a>  wouldn't operate my business, or I don't run my home that way, and we shouldn't operate a city government that way either, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=784.589s">So</a>  I support Councilor Lungo's motion to table for one week. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=790.171s">Councilor</a>  Lungo, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=791.272s">Just</a>  briefly, thank you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=793.673s">I</a>  think one simple thing that needs to be done, even if we can't discuss <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=798.43s">you</a>  know, everything within a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=799.811s">I</a>  think one thing that needs to be done is that capital plan that we were given about 9669 months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=806.373s">It's</a>  completely changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=807.894s">Um,</a>  something that was supposed to be done seven years from now is now being asked for the third reading tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=813.517s">So</a>  that needs to be revamped. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=815.457s">I</a>  mean, redrafted basically because the largest thing within that five year plan was the metric police station or, you know, an update in that of that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=824.021s">And</a>  that is completely changed the whole <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=826.588s">draft</a>  capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=828.308s">And</a>  I think that's just one simple thing that could be looked into and given to us within a week's time so that we have a better idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=835.85s">Even</a>  if it is just a draft, it's a better idea of where we're going, how we're moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=840.85s">And</a>  I think it's something that's necessary and we're not going to get it unless if we keep rubber stamping everything that's put before us.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=971.541s">Roy</a>  Bellison, Superintendent of Schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=978.562s">Mr.</a>  President, members of the Council, thank you for hearing us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=981.583s">The</a>  Medford School Committee recently approved a statement of interest to the Massachusetts School Building Authority, the purpose of which is to be very proactive and to find out, under the core program, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=996.908s">that</a>  is funded by MSBA, what projects would be fundable for Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1007.537s">This</a>  particular SOI does not bind the city financially in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1012.201s">What</a>  it does is it enables the process to begin and to bring out a team from MSBA to sit with us to go over the various projects that may be possible <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1024.022s">and</a>  to determine what they would be considered eligible for possible funding going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1031.484s">Now,</a>  if in fact they identify projects that are eligible for going forward, we would then have to come back to you and talk to you about the possibility of doing a feasibility study, which would then possibly lead to design, and then later construction documents, which would then lead to an actual implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1051.168s">But</a>  at this point, all we're asking <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1053.074s">you</a>  for is approval to submit to the state an opportunity to meet with their team to review what we have at our schools and determine what is eligible for funding under their current funding structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1068.365s">I</a>  think it's a very proactive thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1069.886s">I</a>  think it's consistent with what I just heard about being part of a plan rather than simply asking for an item at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1076.851s">And</a>  I think that it's the kind of thing that we want to do to know what we can go forward with on our own or what we should go forward with on our own and what we clearly need support from the state for or could be eligible for support from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1090.1s">I</a>  think it's particularly significant since as we look at the future, inflation of construction costs certainly goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1097.788s">and</a>  the possibility of the reduction of reimbursement goes down as the city's wealth increases and our eligibility for a higher reimbursement rate might decrease. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1108.297s">This</a>  is clearly something that would, if it goes forward, would be a two to three year activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1113.561s">It</a>  wouldn't be something that would happen overnight, but it would be something that enables us to get into the discussion range with the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1123.049s">So</a>  with that, I just ask that the City Council <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1126.618s">approve</a>  what the school committee has already approved, allow us to submit a statement of interest to MSBA so that we can begin the process of exploring what might be helpful to us in Medford and what we can have the state share the cost of. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1142.848s">Happy</a>  to take any questions.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1144.029s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendents. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1145.83s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1147.411s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1149.633s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Billson for, Superintendent Billson, for coming before us with this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1155.677s">If</a>  you could <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1156.572s">maybe</a>  with your experience, go over what type of projects would be funded through these types of 55% reimbursement grants, just so we can kind of have an idea of, I guess, the history of the grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1172.196s">And</a>  that would be my first question.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1173.676s">So</a>  there are two programs at MSBA that take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1178.898s">One</a>  is called Accelerated Repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1181.267s">That's</a>  not the program we're applying under. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1183.029s">This</a>  is the core program for renovation and rebuilding and possible new construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1190.156s">There</a>  are priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1191.217s">There</a>  are different seven priorities that the state lists that they would consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1195.681s">We</a>  have selected four of them that we've brought in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1201.847s">All</a>  the items listed may not be items we're interested in, but we put them down because if the state comes out, we'll talk about everything that's possible and see what their interest level is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1213.174s">So,</a>  for example, it's highly unlikely that we're interested in boilers because we just replaced the boilers, okay, at Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1220.698s">But</a>  we put it down because boilers lead to a discussion of heating systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1225.02s">An</a>  important thing to talk about is an upgrade, if you will, of the fire alarm system. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1230.025s">at</a>  Medford High School, it goes back to 1970. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1232.748s">So</a>  it's clear that this is a good time to look at the fire alarm system. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1238.173s">We</a>  know that the roof was replaced in 2001. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1242.137s">We</a>  know that at some point in time, the roof is going to need <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1245.213s">a</a>  replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1245.893s">We</a>  think it's five, six years out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1247.974s">But</a>  if we got funding for it, it would be propitious to move forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1253.134s">We</a>  know that the vocational school is moving into very high-tech areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1259.736s">And</a>  anything that would allow us to improve our shops in ways that would enable us to offer state-of-the-art programs above and beyond what we're currently doing is an advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1269.938s">So</a>  anything that moves the show forward <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1272.823s">enables</a>  us to look at the things that would be useful going forward as something that we would like to explore. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1279.028s">Another</a>  example would be the floor tiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1281.75s">The</a>  floor tiles contain a certain amount of asbestos in them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1285.232s">Now,</a>  they're not dangerous because they're not friable, but you can't pick them up without an abatement, and an abatement costs a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1293.558s">So</a>  if we're going to have to change the flooring, if we're going to improve the flooring and things of that type, then we should have somebody else join with us and partner with us in the funding of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1302.855s">So</a>  those are the kinds of discussions we would like to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1306.436s">We</a>  certainly know that some things they'll tell us we're not high enough priority for because there are other places that are in greater need. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1314.439s">But</a>  there are some things that might actually fly through and we'd like to find out what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1319.2s">And</a>  that will inform not only a funding proposal potentially going forward, which would then come before you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1326.213s">But</a>  it also informs what we would then push for in local capital funding, which would be necessary to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1332.684s">Technology</a>  is another major area, with testing now being done on computers, with <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1338.338s">reporting</a>  all being done on computers and data management and the like, it's critical that, you know, our technology be totally up to date and 100% that we continue to move forward with that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1350.547s">That's</a>  an area that might be of interest to the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1353.289s">We</a>  certainly would move forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1354.61s">We've</a>  also applied or will apply under the e-rate program, the universal libraries program, and we think we're eligible for about $600,000 there on top of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1364.941s">So</a>  these are things that we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1366.862s">We</a>  want to advance our possibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1369.324s">We</a>  want to put before you all the possibilities for outside funding that will complement local funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1375.869s">And</a>  the only way we can find out is if we sit with the state in a formal process and review and explore what they would consider a priority for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1385.436s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1387.077s">That</a>  kind of answered what was going to be my second question, kind of as, what is Medford looking for for our high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1395.276s">versus</a>  what in the past these grants have been used for in other cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1400.659s">So</a>  with that being said, did the school committee or did you bring anything for us tonight with regards to a list, something in writing that says what the city of Medford's needs are for the high school?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1413.666s">Well,</a>  the SOI includes everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1416.499s">The</a>  SOI just simply talks about everything possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1420.342s">We</a>  would look at the entire building with MSBA and not leave anything out that they might consider eligible for funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1428.928s">The</a>  school committee obviously wants to anticipate possible needs going forward, as I indicated, flooring, staircases, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1437.217s">The</a>  fire alarm system, these are things, the roof, these are things that should be looked at because the building is going to be 50 years old in another couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1445.727s">And</a>  we have a very solid building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1448.591s">It's</a>  not a building that needs to be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1451.354s">You</a>  can't buy a CMU building anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1455.978s">with</a>  the kind of money out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1457.338s">Somerville</a>  is, what, $250 million to replace a building? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1461.399s">Minuteman</a>  is $155 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1463.84s">Waltham's</a>  looking at a couple hundred million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1466.341s">We're</a>  not going to spend that kind of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1467.801s">We</a>  have the solid structure, but we have to make sure the internal systems are going to be up to date so they can go for another 40, 50 years before someone has to consider whether this building has any further life. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1480.67s">So</a>  that's sort of what we're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1482.071s">I</a>  think the school committee wants to understand and hear what the state is willing to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1486.776s">And</a>  I think we have a very extensive list of just almost a laundry list of everything we would look at.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1492.041s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1495.144s">So</a>  you have the list to provide to us?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1497.286s">It's</a>  on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1498.587s">If</a>  you read through, you'll see the things that the school committee approved as things they would like the MSBA to look at.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1512.513s">Where</a>  is that list? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1513.313s">I</a>  have like a list that says number one and then on the second page it says number six, number seven.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1518.955s">That</a>  it references. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1521.096s">So</a>  under each of the four priorities to address, we list a whole series of things we'd like MSBA to look at with us.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1530.679s">Is</a>  that on the last page, number six, number seven?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1533.72s">Those</a>  are one, the last two pages.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1538.481s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1541.113s">Is</a>  that on the document dated March 17th, 2017? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1543.475s">March</a>  16th, 2017.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1546.457s">March</a>  16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1547.177s">Yeah,</a>  well, my address is March 17th, mine's March 16th.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1550.8s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor LaRusso.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1555.443s">So</a>  just so I understand it better, would the SOI come in and bring in their own experts so they would know how out of date our systems are or when they're going to eventually need updating? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1568.754s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1569.395s">So</a>  the heating experts, so they would be telling us, the first priority is the roof, then the heating, then the boilers have another 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1577.06s">So</a>  they'd give you a list and say, you are eligible for these funds and not these.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1581.744s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1582.264s">They</a>  would tell us, these are the things that we would consider funding with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1586.447s">These</a>  are the things you're going to do yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1588.829s">Point</a>  of information, if I can.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1591.151s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1593.412s">From</a>  what you just said, Mr. Superintendent, what Councilwoman <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1598.741s">Longo</a>  just mentioned, the confusion that I want to make clear is, you're telling us they'll tell us what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1609.186s">But</a>  let's say something is needed today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1617.11s">And</a>  we're saying, let's say the HVAC needs to be done today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1621.632s">But</a>  they had that on their list as three to be funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1625.592s">Are</a>  we going to fund their request instead of what we think is, like the HVAC, that's probably the... So that's a discussion, Councilor, that we would have.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1636.176s">First</a>  we want to know who's going to join with us on what projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1639.777s">And</a>  then the school committee, and then obviously you, because you have to bond with us, to determine which items will take precedence and priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1649.42s">Because</a>  otherwise, you know, we have a plan that <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1652.646s">might</a>  avoid doing something that we consider more important and MSBA might not consider as a priority for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1660.929s">But</a>  we have to begin to understand what they will fund so we can understand how many dollars we might have left to tackle other issues and go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1670.333s">Now</a>  it may be something they're willing to fund that we don't care to fund in the short term. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1675.418s">We</a>  can keep it on the boards, but once they determine it's eligible, we can go back and apply for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1680.58s">So</a>  the goal is to know what we can apply for so that we know which items have to be funded by ourselves and which items can be funded in partnership, and then to determine the prioritization and the timing of each of these projects.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1695.227s">And</a>  one of my last questions, with regards to the amount of these grants that are given, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1702.461s">if</a>  you know from other cities and towns that have got them in the past, or if Medford has gotten any, what are we talking? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1708.925s">Are</a>  we talking you'll maybe get a grant for one or two things? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1713.728s">Is</a>  there a cap amount-wise? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1715.789s">Or</a>  are we talking, are we potentially $20, $30 million?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1720.732s">It</a>  really depends on what they determine eligibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1724.954s">Somerville,</a>  when they're rebuilding the high school, I guess, is eligible for about $130 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1729.967s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1730.528s">Now,</a>  we're not, I don't think we're in that category. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1734.03s">We're</a>  looking at something much smaller than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1735.892s">But</a>  clearly, whatever they determine we're eligible for, we'll put a price tag on it after we do some feasibility work. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1743.078s">And</a>  then we can decide how much this community wants to invest at this particular point in time or going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1749.043s">But</a>  at least we know <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1751.119s">what</a>  our partners are willing to put up on the table so that we can give you an informed proposal for both local capital planning and partnered capital planning.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1762.244s">And</a>  my last question, I guess, would be with regards to, I guess, the whole system, Medford High School and all of our other elementary and grade schools with regards to every school needing maintenance, having maintenance issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1776.65s">I've</a>  heard from a few <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1778.035s">parents</a>  over the last month or so and beyond with regards to issues within each school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1783.917s">Have</a>  the grade schools and the elementary schools also been looked at with regards to their needs and how we are going to kind of assess it all, this and the grade schools?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1794.422s">So</a>  the school committee had several meetings on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1797.723s">And</a>  it's our impression that while there are things to be done at every school, obviously you have to keep it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1805.676s">The</a>  major issues will be going forward at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1808.498s">High</a>  school is now the oldest major building in our possession. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1814.541s">One</a>  of the things I told the school committee, so I feel comfortable sharing it here, is that in next year's budget, I will look to increase the amount of money put in for maintenance across the board so that we can do some of the things that people have raised independent of any capital planning and independent of any state-funded planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1834.296s">We</a>  also have grants, as we've indicated before, that are also giving us money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1839.18s">For</a>  example, we got $100,000 or just under $100,000 in biosciences recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1844.404s">We</a>  got a $500,000 grant in capital skills development from the state just the other day, a week ago Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1852.069s">And</a>  we've got some other grants out there they're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1854.271s">There's</a>  about $600,000, $700,000 in technology funding that we are eligible for that we're putting together the proposed for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1860.896s">It's</a>  an entitlement as long as we meet certain requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1863.965s">So</a>  we're putting all of this together to come so that we can actually deal with issues with other people's money as much as possible, but certainly recognizing that not everything that we want to do will be eligible for funding by an outside agency.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1880.493s">That's</a>  it for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1881.013s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1881.813s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1883.714s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1884.594s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1886.115s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent Felsen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1889.757s">Thanks</a>  for the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1890.957s">I</a>  agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1892.717s">The</a>  building is 50 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1894.318s">It</a>  was going to be 50 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1896.378s">It</a>  definitely needs improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1898.479s">I</a>  talk to parents on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1902.341s">And</a>  a lot of parents that don't have kids at the high school yet, but they've been up to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1907.623s">And</a>  the building does need work. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1909.644s">When</a>  I was on the school committee with Councilor Scarpelli, we had the science lab renovation, 17 new science labs, which was <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1921.124s">a</a>  great project for the community, for the school system, and really, you know, the state-of-the-art school labs and science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1929.827s">And</a>  these are important, especially for programming, future programming for the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1936.369s">And,</a>  you know, we want to make sure that we have these programs in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1939.97s">We</a>  want to make sure our buildings are up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1942.851s">I</a>  mean, there's one thing that I learned when I was on the school committee is people have an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1947.885s">people</a>  have a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1949.025s">Years</a>  ago, you went to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1951.246s">Maybe</a>  you went to parochial school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1952.746s">Now</a>  you can go to public school, public charter school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1955.307s">You</a>  can go to private school, parochial school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1957.047s">I</a>  mean, there's all kinds of options for people now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1959.327s">So</a>  I think a lot of people would like to go to school right here in Medford, but they want to make sure that their facilities are first class in nature and make sure that the programs that are being offered, for example, at the vocational school, are first rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1976.091s">And</a>  I think we're heading in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1978.442s">But</a>  I think we do need a cash infusion to make sure that a lot of this happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1982.184s">And</a>  it's nice to see that to potentially get 55% reimbursement from the state, that doesn't come along every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1989.807s">And</a>  we took advantage of that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1992.428s">When</a>  the science labs came across, I think we got 55, maybe even a little bit more, a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=1999.311s">Between</a>  55 and 60%, I think, reimbursement on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2002.473s">So</a>  I think this is a great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2005.494s">And</a>  I think that it's something that we should take advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2008.773s">One</a>  of the questions that I had with regard to, you mentioned HVAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2013.774s">So</a>  would the HVAC include the actual individual heating systems in each of the classrooms at the high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2018.656s">Okay,</a>  that's perfect because I know one of the complaints that I got when I was on the school committee was, you know, it'd be hot and cold in some of the buildings and sometimes there'd be no heat at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2028.719s">So</a>  I think that would be a definite good addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2035.604s">I</a>  also want to talk about the, let's see, you mentioned here in this memo it says, number seven, replacement of or addition to obsolete buildings in order to provide a full range of programs consistent with state and approved local requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2051.535s">MPS</a>  is seeking additional space on the high school campus by adding a cafeteria that can accommodate up to at least 500 students, a performing arts center that can accommodate up to 1,000 guests, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2061.75s">adequate</a>  locker room facilities for male and female athletes, a fitness and wellness center, and expansion of vocational technical space to create a career pathway model. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2072.952s">Can</a>  you comment on that a little bit? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2074.453s">Is</a>  that talking about possibly a new structure, or is that building off the structures that we currently have?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2080.334s">So</a>  let me give you a couple of examples. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2082.754s">Anyone</a>  who's been up to high school, by the way, with a lot of, and with your help, by the way, and I appreciate that, a lot of capital projects have been done, and I could enumerate them <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2091.13s">You</a>  know, at some point, if you're interested, the council has approved money for them, so I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2096.653s">But</a>  let's take the locker rooms at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2099.335s">You've</a>  been up to the locker rooms at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2100.815s">You</a>  know they're old, and you know that they're not particularly what we want them to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2105.578s">The</a>  girls' locker room, it is what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2108.159s">There's</a>  a lot of old things in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2110.221s">There's</a>  a lot of old marble, old shower stalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2113.229s">It's</a>  a lot of empty space, unutilized space. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2116.593s">That</a>  needs to be redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2118.214s">Because</a>  if it's redone, we'll recapture some space for other programming, and we can provide a state-of-the-art locker room for the young women to use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2127.504s">The</a>  same thing is true with the men's locker room. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2131.033s">We</a>  need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2132.034s">It's</a>  just these are the things that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2133.735s">When</a>  you talk about a performing arts center, that may be a little aspirational, you know, in regard because, you know, we're talking about having a program that promotes the theater arts and promotes media and the like, but I don't know that we need to go to 1,000 seats right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2149.343s">So</a>  that may be a little bit aspirational, but the people doing the thinking raised it and said, you know, let's put it down and let's see if there's some interest in doing more with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2160.543s">I</a>  think those are the kinds of cafeteria right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2163.005s">There's</a>  three cafeterias. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2164.587s">It</a>  may be that we can reconfigure them, especially since right now, as you undoubtedly have heard, maybe read in the transcript recently, we're redoing the Cafe Electra into a brand new hospitality and restaurant suite with state money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2180.628s">And</a>  that's critical because that's going to be up on the first floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2183.409s">That's</a>  going to be a restaurant for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2185.39s">That's</a>  going to tie into our partnerships with WIN, which is creating the casino up the street and developing job opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2193.955s">That's</a>  going to tie into a whole pile of activities and revenue generating activities that will support other programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2201.565s">And</a>  that will free up space where Cafe Elector is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2204.126s">And</a>  we can do some other things with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2205.506s">So</a>  this is a whole process of looking at how we can reconfigure space to our greatest advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2212.028s">Now</a>  the print shop, because they don't use the big presses anymore, can now go down to a smaller place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2217.87s">We</a>  don't have to give them the big cavern that they had because they don't use that anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2222.131s">That's</a>  not what printing is about anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2224.651s">So</a>  Dr. Riccio, for example, has created what we'll call clusters or academies. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2230.808s">putting</a>  programs together, human service programs together, construction programs together, programs that deal with media and development together, so that they can interact with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2243.234s">So</a>  that a youngster, when they're trained, is cross-trained for more than one area. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2248.076s">That</a>  creates great opportunities for our young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2250.617s">Instead</a>  of being trained only in one area, you're trained in multiple areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2253.719s">You</a>  may have noticed that we've virtually recaptured all the students from Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2258.261s">By</a>  next year, we'll have only eight students at Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2261.233s">We'll</a>  have saved a million dollars a year on that alone by putting these programs together. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2267.977s">By</a>  bringing some students in from the outside, we're recapturing revenue, possibly projecting over two or three years a million dollars a year in new revenue coming into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2277.103s">This</a>  is going to help us weather the storm, whether it's federal cutbacks, state failure to pay, or some of the local issues, the priorities that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2285.689s">So</a>  these are ways that I think we're moving forward, and I believe that <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2290.38s">Looking</a>  at our school at 50 years of age and looking for another 50 years from that building is a really good time to start and be proactive now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2298.582s">Plan,</a>  recognizing we've got to come back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2302.084s">You're</a>  not voting for money tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2303.384s">You're</a>  voting for planning tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2305.084s">You're</a>  voting to be proactive, to look and see what's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2308.686s">And</a>  that's what we were asking you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2309.906s">And</a>  I think it's a great opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2311.586s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2311.926s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2314.027s">I</a>  agree with you with regard to the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2317.306s">In</a>  my opinion, I think it's the hidden jewel of the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2319.747s">I</a>  mean, there are so many great opportunities that are happening at the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2324.249s">You</a>  know, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2325.189s">Riccio</a>  and her staff are doing a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2328.03s">And</a>  I mean, there's so much demand now to go to the vocational school, and it's kind of the best of both worlds. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2333.992s">You</a>  learn a trade, and you can still go to college if you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2336.793s">So</a>  you really, you have the best of both worlds. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2340.535s">It's</a>  an exciting time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2341.375s">There</a>  are more and more young kids going to the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2344.997s">It's</a>  a great time to reinvest, not only in the high school, but in the shops of the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2351.081s">I</a>  mean, when you think about it, at the end of the day, our buildings are our most important assets with regard to the future of Method students. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2358.325s">We</a>  need to make sure that they are first class and make sure that all of our technology is current as can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2367.311s">You</a>  had mentioned previously about the potential for feasibility studies. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2373.07s">So</a>  if we have to do a feasibility study, is that something that we would have to pay for, or is that something that would be, would the MSBA help out with the cost of something like that?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2382.594s">If</a>  we become eligible, we would then petition MSBA for the feasibility, a feasibility study for the specific projects that we determined were the priority that we wanted to go with them for, or with, and they would reimburse us <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2400.462s">At</a>  the same rate, they would reimburse the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2403.164s">So</a>  if the feasibility study was $500,000 and we're eligible for 50%, we'd get $250,000 back. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2410.589s">We</a>  lay it out, but they reimburse us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2413.931s">I'm</a>  all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2415.312s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2415.952s">Thank</a>  you, Councilman. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2416.812s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2417.993s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2419.534s">Mr.</a>  Bellson, thank you for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2421.536s">I</a>  think you do a great job, and I appreciate you coming down here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2425.938s">So</a>  I think it's safe to say that you feel as though <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2428.93s">going</a>  forward with this statement of interest is the most prudent course at this point in time?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2433.514s">It</a>  gets us in the game, and it allows us to consider our options, which I think is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2439.078s">Earlier</a>  this evening I heard you talking, you want to consider options, well you want to know who's going to pay for what. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2443.681s">And</a>  if you've got somebody else who wants to pay for it, or will help you pay for it, you want to know that before you put your own money on the table.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2451.019s">And</a>  this matter did come before the school committee and it was endorsed by the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2454.76s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2454.84s">I</a>  have the copies of the votes if you need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2456.38s">Do</a>  you recall what the vote was? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2457.9s">Pardon</a>  me? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2458.2s">Do</a>  you recall what the vote was?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2459.12s">7-0.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2459.56s">7-0.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2460.001s">So</a>  it's endorsed by the superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2462.541s">It's</a>  endorsed by the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2464.221s">And</a>  the purpose of the paper before us this evening, as I understand it, is that you're really seeking permission to meet with the state to examine what competitive grant opportunities the Massachusetts School Building Authority has out there for us that the Metro Public School District may be eligible for?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2479.044s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2480.716s">by</a>  submitting this application in the statement of interest, the Massachusetts School Building Authority in no way guarantees that we're going to receive money in the city of Medford, in no way guarantees that we're going to expend money?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2491.306s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2492.727s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2493.968s">Move</a>  for approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2496.491s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2498.833s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2500.014s">And</a>  I want to thank Superintendent Belson for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2504.458s">As</a>  the superintendent stated, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2507.505s">This</a>  council, over the last several years, has approved many building programs within the Medford High School and the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2519.391s">And</a>  I think we've been very supportive as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2523.113s">My</a>  question tonight, Mr. President, is not regarding whether or not the high school needs improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2529.075s">I</a>  have two students that attend Medford High School, and I can speak firsthand that Medford High School, indeed, needs improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2538.495s">But</a>  my question to the superintendent is, my first question, back in September of 2016, the school committee, along with Mayor Burke, formulated a priority facility improvement list, of which they outlined $13,787,000 worth of repairs in the high school and our other school buildings, of which $10,100,000 was earmarked to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2567.642s">Of</a>  that 10,100,000, Mr. Superintendent, what percentage of that 10,100,000 is in the current SOI?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2576.223s">So</a>  I can't tell you that because basically we listed almost everything that we possibly could think of in the SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2583.145s">So</a>  it really depends on what the state determines would be eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2588.886s">I</a>  would say most of the things that we listed on that would be something we would discuss with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2594.167s">There</a>  may be some things that they would say, that's your problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2597.403s">You</a>  know, okay.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2598.384s">So,</a>  so, and the reason why I asked Mr. Superintendent is, and I'll get into this a little bit later on, but, uh, we were recently told three weeks ago that, uh, in order to build a combined police and fire center, that we were told this by a treasurer collector and also by the mayor that, uh, the amount of money we were looking to bond would cause the city to have to go into a proposition two and a half override. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2624.368s">And</a>  that was one of the factors the administration stated why we couldn't bond for $38 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2630.049s">So</a>  the reason why I'm trying to get some facts and figures tonight is I want to make sure that we're not going down the same avenue that the mayor and the treasurer-collector were so adamantly opposed to three weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2644.793s">And</a>  I'm hoping to get those answers from you tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2648.474s">So</a>  as part of the SOI, from what I can see, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2652.902s">The</a>  capital plan that was put forth by the mayor and the school committee back in September of 2016 did not include a 500-student cafeteria, did not include a performing arts center for 1,000 students, did not include a fitness center, and did not include, from what I can see, windows and boilers. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2679.585s">Now</a>  if I could just finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2681.727s">So</a>  based on the $10 million that was out there for other renovations, which included Medford High School flooring, which you mentioned had asbestos, which I would agree needs to be removed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2694.354s">Roof</a>  replacement for $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2696.676s">Fire</a>  alarm system, which we know has been on the blink for a number of years, for $1,200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2705.028s">And</a>  $1 million to deconstruct the skateboard area and install modular units in the back of the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2714.272s">So</a>  at what expense is the addition of a cafeteria for 500 students, a performing arts center for 1,000, fitness center, windows, and boilers going to add to the $10 million that the school committee came out in September of 2016? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2729.938s">OK,</a>  so let me try and answer this way.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2732.038s">They're</a>  all good questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2732.999s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2734.395s">Personally,</a>  I allowed the planning team at the high school to put down some of their aspirational things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2742.039s">Now,</a>  I don't personally think I need a 500-student cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2746.002s">Personally,</a>  I don't think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2747.543s">But</a>  I wouldn't tell my people they can't ask for it and let somebody else tell them, we don't think we'd fund that, OK? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2753.926s">So</a>  I don't think that's going to be something MSBA is going to be interested in, because I think they already know we have cafeterias. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2760.57s">And</a>  they'd say, probably, why don't you just put a coat of paint on and do some other things? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2764.395s">So</a>  I don't think that's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2766.377s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2767.397s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2768.498s">And</a>  I appreciate what you're saying, but doesn't that just muddy the waters? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2771.46s">Because</a>  when I look at the SOI request, I'll be quite frank, it looks like we're building a brand new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2779.747s">I</a>  mean, if you go through the list from roof to boiler to windows to flooring, I mean, it looks like we're building a brand new building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2786.612s">And</a>  I think to add stuff into the SOI that maybe you didn't agree upon as superintendent or thought it wasn't a priority, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2794.551s">I</a>  think muddies the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2796.852s">And</a>  what we have here, in my opinion, is a project that is probably closer to $30 or $40 million if we were to get total funding or total approval, I should say, from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2811.541s">And</a>  I know there's reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2813.622s">The</a>  number 55% has been tossed around. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2816.044s">I</a>  talked to the State Building Assistance Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2819.166s">Don't</a>  bet your bottom dollar on 55%. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2821.107s">In</a>  the past, we've received <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2823.285s">upwards</a>  of 59% for the science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2825.866s">But</a>  there is nothing set in stone. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2828.668s">I</a>  know the mayor put that in her letter, but according to the school building assistance, they have not arrived at any funding percentages as of today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2837.292s">So</a>  in a good predicament, we could get 50%. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2842.115s">But</a>  my question, Mr. Superintendent, why throw everything into the mix? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2846.717s">Shouldn't</a>  we be looking at our major priorities? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2849.879s">We</a>  should be looking at the major deficiencies in the school? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2853.0s">Because</a>  that's what the SOI calls for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2854.961s">It</a>  calls for the major deficiencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2857.203s">And</a>  you yourself are saying, I don't think our deficiency is adding a 1,000-person performance center or a 500-person cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2865.817s">but</a>  it may be the alarm system or it may be an issue like Councilor Scarpelli talked about, other building improvements that need to be done immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2875.702s">So</a>  I think that's the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2877.323s">Why</a>  are we throwing everything at the wall right now?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2880.364s">Again,</a>  as I said to you, the SOI is a planning document. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2884.166s">It's</a>  to get you into an exploration process and to find out what the state is willing to pay for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2890.189s">So</a>  you put down everything to talk about, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2892.48s">And</a>  you find out that they're going to discard a few things here and a few things there, and maybe several things, and say that's really not important enough to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2899.365s">But</a>  we'll find out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2901.967s">The</a>  document that you had in front of you is really a document that was produced in September, or early on, based on what people thought at that particular time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2911.394s">Different</a>  things emerge. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2912.828s">People</a>  want to talk about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2914.449s">There</a>  are some ideas that the headmaster has, that the vocational director has, that, you know, we put it down so that we could explore them with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2922.274s">Not</a>  because we necessarily think that they're going to fund all these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2926.256s">We</a>  want to get into an exploratory process to examine what is possible for partnership with state funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2934.261s">And</a>  then we'll merge the documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2936.622s">The</a>  key thing you have to remember is we have to come back to you for the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2940.248s">And</a>  any amount that we're going to spend, you're going to prioritize along with the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2944.909s">It's</a>  not going to be the superintendent who makes the final call. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2947.39s">The</a>  superintendent might make a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2949.49s">But</a>  you're going to decide, and the mayor's going to decide, and the school committee's going to decide how much money you're willing to put on the table at any given point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2957.652s">But</a>  knowing what's eligible gives you a leg up on what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2962.754s">And</a>  as far as the percentage goes, I know what other people are getting at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2967.035s">I</a>  know what the relative things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2969.328s">The</a>  state's not going to commit to something before they see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2972.31s">I</a>  know we fall in that basic line of where we would be eligible, because I know what the economics are between the different communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2979.895s">It</a>  doesn't mean that it won't go down a little bit, because obviously the wealth of the community is increasing.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2987.62s">So</a>  Mr. Superintendent, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=2990.239s">So</a>  based on the laundry list that we're submitting in the SOI, and it is a laundry list, wouldn't it make more sense for us to prioritize what our needs are so we don't count on or have to count on some state bureaucrat coming back saying, you know what, Method, we know you need a fire alarm system and a sprinkler system and windows and an HVA system, but we're gonna give you a cafeteria for 500 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3015.8s">They're</a>  not gonna do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3017.263s">Mr.</a>  Secretary, we don't know what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3019.865s">But</a>  why not put together a list of what our priorities are and not just put together a list of, it sounds great. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3028.212s">You</a>  put everything in there in the kitchen sink and say, hey, look, we're looking to get funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3032.255s">It</a>  sounds great in theory, but it's not practical. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3035.698s">I</a>  don't believe it's practical to put everything in the SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3039.001s">And</a>  I'd rather see, like Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, a list of what our top priorities are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3044.31s">and</a>  have them go through our top priorities, Mr. Superintendent, and then make a selection from our top priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3051.451s">And</a>  if a 500 student cafeteria is not on the top of your priority list as superintendent of the school committee's priority list, then that should be at the bottom of the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3063.914s">Or</a>  not on the list at all, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3067.395s">I</a>  hear what you're saying, but I'm <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3070.106s">My</a>  experience tells me in meeting, because I've had these meetings before. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3073.047s">As</a>  you know, we've had science labs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3074.527s">We've</a>  built new buildings and so on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3076.128s">My</a>  experience tells me that when we sit down with them, we'll focus in on the things that are high priority first. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3081.67s">And</a>  then we'll look at whether any of these other things are possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3086.331s">But</a>  they know the difference between a firearm system and a roof and a cafeteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3092.693s">They</a>  know the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3093.513s">And</a>  they know where we would like to go first. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3096.354s">This</a>  is an attempt to give everybody, every stakeholder, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3099.648s">who</a>  was involved in the planning process of putting an SOI together, a chance to be heard, rather than say your idea is not worth being explored with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3110.156s">We're</a>  giving them a chance to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3111.957s">But</a>  you know and I know that the state will zero in on firearms and roofs and heating systems long before they worry about the cafeteria.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3121.956s">And</a>  if we were so concerned of having every stakeholder seat at the table, why don't we see the middle school and elementary schools as a separate S.O.I., Mr. Superintendent, which can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3133.06s">I'm</a>  sure you know that as superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3135.32s">There</a>  is no mention about the needs of, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn mentioned, the secondary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3141.659s">within</a>  this, and nor should it be, because this is a high school proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3145.742s">But</a>  there's also proposals that are in need, as you know, in our other schools, in dire need. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3151.865s">So</a>  my question is then, my second question, Mr. President, is the fact that I realize the order which takes place as you submit the SOI, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3165.672s">I</a>  didn't realize after you submit the SOI then you go sit down with the state people. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3169.656s">I</a>  didn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3170.276s">You're</a>  telling me you now then go sit down with the state people and you, what do you do, compromise with them?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3176.702s">No,</a>  you sit down and you go over and they'll tell you what they would consider to be priorities, what they would consider to be something that they would consider to be of concern to them, what they would like to fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3187.742s">I</a>  mean, after all, they're accountable to their funding agency and their board as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3192.064s">So</a>  I think that they'd be more interested in a fire alarm system, a roof, heating systems, more so than some of the other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3199.926s">But,</a>  you know, we're giving them all these things, and they might say, you know, we're doing something with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3205.368s">Who</a>  knew a few years ago that they were going to be funding science labs? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3208.909s">But</a>  we put it in front of them, and we got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3212.41s">You</a>  know, you have to try all these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3214.571s">You</a>  put it in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3215.412s">You</a>  say, are you interested in this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3216.512s">Could</a>  you consider this to be a reasonable investment? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3220.954s">Maybe</a>  someone's going to say, yes, you know, we've got an interest in this at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3225.357s">So</a>  we're moving forward with a planning process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3228.678s">That's</a>  all we're doing tonight, asking you to allow us to go forward proactively and find out what the state wants to prioritize in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3237.863s">And</a>  this is going to take probably two to three years to actually actualize. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3242.48s">In</a>  the meantime, that will inform, you know, our other capital planning that may have to be locally funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3249.667s">And</a>  we will form also our maintenance issues, which will be locally funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3254.612s">So,</a>  and then grant applications we make. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3256.914s">If</a>  someone were to say we can't get grants for this, you know, for example, we built the, we're building the Culinary Arts and Hospitality Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3264.001s">That</a>  wasn't gonna be funded by MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3267.237s">But</a>  we got a grant to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3269.679s">So</a>  we have to know where we have to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3271.46s">We</a>  have to know what's possible under what set of funding and what's possible under other sets of funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3276.184s">And</a>  then we can then lay it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3277.665s">And</a>  of course, we're going to have to work with you and the school committee for any kind of local money that's going to be needed to move the project forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3286.086s">This</a>  isn't you say yes tonight, and I go off and do whatever I want. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3290.327s">This</a>  is you say yes tonight, we get the process going, and then we come back to you and sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3295.048s">And</a>  it should be a robust process, because the city wants to move forward on some good projects, not only in the schools, but in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3302.87s">And</a>  we look forward to that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3305.31s">So</a>  if I could, Mr. Superintendent, I know you're probably not prepared tonight to put a dollar amount onto your deficiency request. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3314.013s">But</a>  you were able to put a dollar amount back <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3316.585s">in</a>  September 2016 on the laundry list of items that you mentioned needed repair at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3323.331s">Are</a>  you prepared tonight to put a dollar amount on your SOI request to the state?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3328.116s">No,</a>  because I don't know, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3330.753s">the</a>  extent to which any of these things would be funded.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3333.534s">But</a>  I do know... Now, I'm not talking about funding.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3336.116s">What</a>  is the actual cost of your SOI request? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3338.717s">You</a>  know, I wouldn't want to, you know, give you a guess right now, because quite frankly, it depends on the extent to which you do them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3346.741s">You</a>  know, and any one of these things might be a partial thing, maybe some windows, maybe some doors, and maybe not all, maybe all doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3355.365s">I</a>  don't think we, you know, we can do that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3357.826s">When</a>  we get back from a planning process, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3360.73s">and</a>  we get to a financial phase, then we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3364.791s">That's</a>  the most prudent way to do it, not to throw speculative numbers out there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3369.532s">And</a>  if people come and say, look, that's too much at any one time, then that'll be too much at any one time.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3374.513s">Okay,</a>  so what you're asking then is the council to let you go forward, and then in deliberations, when you submit your SOI with the state, you'll go back and forth with the state, and they'll determine what projects will be done or approved, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3390.083s">And</a>  if they come back and say, you know what, Method, we like everything in your SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3394.906s">There's</a>  been a lack of requests for school building assistance this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3399.97s">And</a>  we're going to fund you for $60 million, Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3402.992s">Congratulations.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3404.413s">And</a>  we're even going to give you half. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3405.574s">We're</a>  going to give you $30 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3408.055s">So</a>  you're going to have to bond for $30 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3410.397s">Are</a>  you prepared to come back to this city, Mr. Superintendent, with a $30 million bond request within the next two to three years?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3418.797s">I'd</a>  be prepared to come back to you to tell you what your options are and to allow you to decide what the finances of this city is willing to support in support of your public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3430.163s">That's</a>  all, just like anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3431.284s">We</a>  come to you with a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3432.365s">We</a>  come to you with other kinds of financial things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3434.726s">You</a>  can tell us how much more you want to put into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3437.608s">But</a>  you know, for example, in five or six years, you're going to replace a roof at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3442.45s">You</a>  are going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3443.731s">The</a>  question is, who's going to pay for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3445.76s">But</a>  if we are eligible to get somebody to share that with us, why not find out now? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3452.083s">You</a>  know that there are some heating things that we want to do at the high school that we should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3457.386s">If</a>  you don't do them in the next few years, you'll end up paying for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3460.388s">So</a>  we should find out if we have a partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3462.929s">And</a>  so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3464.31s">We</a>  know that technology is moving at a rapid rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3468.072s">And</a>  if we know that it's going to be expensive to increase all the technology that's going to be required of public schools, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3474.285s">So</a>  if someone's willing to partner with us, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3478.267s">You'll</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3479.567s">That</a>  gives you those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3480.648s">But</a>  you can decide that, you know, I'm not interested in a performing arts center, and I'm not interested in an expanded cafeteria, and I don't really care about some other things you're interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3489.672s">So</a>  even though someone's willing to partner with us, it's off the table for Medford because we have other things we want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3496.474s">My</a>  job is to give you options. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3498.475s">My</a>  job is to give you an opportunity to look at it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3501.256s">And</a>  who's going to make that decision? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3503.085s">So</a>  let's just say, in a perfect scenario, the state comes back and said, Medford, we're giving you everything you wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3508.387s">Who</a>  ultimately is going to make that decision? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3509.968s">Are</a>  you saying it's this council that's going to sit there? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3512.388s">School</a>  committee, mayor, and council are the arbiters of dollars and cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3517.47s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3517.73s">But</a>  we ultimately have the final funding say, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3522.212s">So</a>  you think this council is going to sit back after the SOI is put in, and if everything works out perfectly, and they come to us and they pay for half, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3530.613s">And</a>  we're getting everything we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3532.633s">You</a>  think the city council is going to sit here and start slashing different items in the budget to make sure that we don't have a proposition two and a half override? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3544.296s">Is</a>  that what you expect this council to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3546.377s">That's</a>  my questioning, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3548.717s">Why</a>  are we throwing everything at the wall when we know what deficiencies we have? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3552.981s">we</a>  should prioritize them right now and move forward on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3556.023s">This</a>  program is going nowhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3557.724s">So</a>  to make people believe that, hey, that's, you know, let's get a partner today. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3561.667s">We</a>  can get a partner today, tomorrow, next year, the year after this program has been around for years and we've taken advantage for many, many years, Mr. Superintendent, you know, uh, we, we got, uh, for a core program, uh, 59.79%. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3573.915s">Um,</a>  uh, it doesn't give the year 2008, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3581.095s">Then</a>  the science labs, we've got 59%, $6 million reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3586.399s">Then</a>  the accelerated repair, $2,409,000, they gave us a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3592.344s">So</a>  I know we've been great partners with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3595.587s">My</a>  concern is eventually, because I've been on this council a number of years, is that eventually the issue's gonna come back before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3603.453s">And</a>  we're gonna be the ones that are gonna be sitting there saying, geez, you know what, the state wants to give us all this money, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3609.819s">but</a>  the city council doesn't want to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3612.622s">They</a>  want to pay half of this and this and this, but they don't want to approve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3616.147s">And</a>  we know what the purse strings are, Mr. Superintendent, when we hear from the mayor three weeks ago, say that she can't afford to do a combined center for police and fire, because according to her and the treasurer collector, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3629.588s">that</a>  the school bonds will be coming offline in the year 2022, which is five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3635.952s">And</a>  she said we can't afford the spending that we want to do for a combined center until 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3641.955s">Now</a>  you're telling us that this project they could be looking for funding maybe two or three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3647.298s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3648.619s">Well,</a>  what I'm telling you is I'm telling you it'll take two to three years to get through the process to actually get <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3654.18s">construction</a>  going on something, any project that gets approved and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3657.941s">But</a>  we won't even get to design feasibility and design until we come back here and talk about what the state is interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3665.964s">And</a>  in the feasibility period, that's when you will make some decisions before we actually go forward with a final number. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3674.166s">I</a>  mean, the reality is that some things will be done over five years, some things may be done over 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3679.783s">The</a>  reality is to find out what we can get some funding for and what we can get support for.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3684.67s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3685.451s">And</a>  that is the reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3686.453s">And</a>  that's why I'm bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3688.015s">There</a>  is a reality behind this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3690.259s">And</a>  when I hear from the administration and the treasurer-collector saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3693.57s">that</a>  we can't afford any more bonds other than what we just did for the police department until the year 2022, unless we want to look at a Prop 2.5 override, I think every member of this council and every citizen should be concerned about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3707.076s">And</a>  we should have a handle on what we're potentially looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3710.878s">And</a>  from what you're telling me now, the process is you just submit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3714.239s">You</a>  really don't know what the dollar amount will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3716.52s">You</a>  just submit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3717.641s">You</a>  hope for the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3719.141s">And</a>  when it comes back, it comes back. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3721.21s">And</a>  then at that point, you look at the financials. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3723.851s">And</a>  what I'm telling you is, the mayor just told us three weeks ago, we're looking at five years down the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3730.092s">And</a>  that doesn't seem what we're looking for for these schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3733.893s">I</a>  mean, I read the SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3734.974s">It</a>  says an SOI should only be filed for a facility where a district has the ability to gain the proper local approvals and to fund a project in the next two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3746.054s">So</a>  they're putting, you know, they want to see commitment, that's why they're asking for a vote, the school committee and the council, and they want to see a funding commitment.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3755.285s">And</a>  we're at such an early stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3757.688s">I</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3759.35s">And</a>  quite frankly, look, you get hit with a lot of decisions that require you to make tough decisions on money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3765.341s">on</a>  policies, on zoning, on any number of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3769.104s">You</a>  can't hide from, not that you want to, from making tough decisions that make some people happy and some people less happy.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3775.549s">With</a>  all due respect, you just stated that you put things in this SOI that you didn't want in there because you were hiding from dealing with other people at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3784.817s">So</a>  don't say people are hiding, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3786.638s">I</a>  said I respected the right of the planning team to forward things <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3792.927s">that</a>  I consider to be, that they consider to be important to them, because I want to respect my administrative team and the teachers and others who participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3800.569s">You're</a>  the educational leader of this community, Mr. Superintendent, and sometimes you have to make the tough decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3805.531s">And</a>  I like the participation of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3807.111s">I</a>  don't have to make all the decisions myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3809.852s">But</a>  the reality is that nothing is going to go forward financially unless you decide you can afford it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3815.947s">Nothing's</a>  going to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3816.868s">We're</a>  trying to explore who wants to partner with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3821.31s">And</a>  you know that the most important things will be systems that are important to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3826.153s">The</a>  operation of the building will get higher priority than some of the things that maybe are aspirational. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3832.397s">You</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3833.737s">So</a>  if you decide that certain things aren't something you want to fund, then you say, well, put that off for a couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3840.304s">But</a>  certainly, you're going to face a roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3842.486s">Certainly,</a>  you're going to face technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3844.448s">Certainly,</a>  you're going to deal with other systems, heating systems and other things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3848.291s">And</a>  if we don't get in the game now, it'll be longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3852.833s">before</a>  we get funding, and if we don't, and if the funding dries up because of the Commonwealth not being able to keep things moving, you see the green line, other things like that, we talk about these things, and it keeps getting pushed off, keeps getting pushed off. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3866.035s">Let's</a>  get in the game, and then you can decide whether or not it's something you desire as a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3872.016s">That's</a>  what we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3873.577s">I</a>  think it's my job to put it in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3875.797s">I</a>  hope it's your job to, or I hope it's your willingness to let me find out what's possible going forward.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3883.339s">So</a>  Mr. Superintendent, just getting back to some of the building deficiencies, would you agree that the restrooms at the high school are a deficiency of Medford High School?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3893.566s">I</a>  would agree that restrooms are something that should be addressed, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3898.75s">How</a>  come they're not part of the SOI? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3900.271s">Because</a>  they're part of the general building envelope. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3902.452s">That's</a>  something that we can talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3903.873s">They're</a>  part of the plumbing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3905.134s">They're</a>  part of the heating system, believe it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3907.295s">It's</a>  all part of the same consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3909.91s">And</a>  just because something isn't written here doesn't mean we can't talk about it with the team that comes out from MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3916.895s">If</a>  we think of other things, we can say, you know, by the way, we'd like you to look at this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3921.017s">This</a>  is to get them, to give them an idea of which communities are interested in seeking partnership with the state.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3929.563s">So</a>  just so I understand, you brought up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3932.945s">So</a>  after the April 7th deadline, you're stating that we can add stuff to the SOI? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3937.828s">We</a>  can talk to them about it, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3939.807s">Not</a>  talk, we can add stuff after the deadline.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3942.871s">We</a>  can talk stuff, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3944.774s">We</a>  can talk with them about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3945.815s">Maybe</a>  they'll let us add, maybe they won't. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3947.678s">But</a>  I'm sure they would consider some of the things that we would bring up.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3952.061s">With</a>  all due respect, Mr. Superintendent, I've been an advocate for a number of years regarding the cleanliness and the deplorable condition of the bathrooms at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3963.972s">And</a>  there's been some headway made, I have to give credit, there's been some headway made with the water bubbles and so forth, but many of the restrooms at the high school are locked down, not because we don't have the manpower to supervise them, it's because they're in deplorable condition, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3980.008s">And</a>  this is coming from first-hand knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3983.391s">And</a>  I can tell you that the fact that it's not addressed in a deficiency in this program and say, well, it's covered under other things, I think is not adequately addressing the deficiencies that we have at that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=3996.22s">It</a>  may not be educational in nature, but what I can tell you is that there are kids at the high school that will hold <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4002.986s">and</a>  going to the restroom a whole day because they're so filthy dirty and you can't get toilet paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4008.671s">There's</a>  no soap. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4009.632s">There's</a>  no paper towels. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4011.795s">There's</a>  no doors on the urinals. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4013.937s">And</a>  I'm just telling you reality, Mr. Superintendent, because you have your own private bathroom and probably don't frequent other restrooms in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4021.404s">And</a>  I could just tell you that from what I hear from students, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4025.228s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, is that's what's happening up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4028.43s">And</a>  I'm saddened to see that it's not addressed in the SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4032.412s">But</a>  if you're telling me it could be added at a later date, that's fine, and I hope it does get added, because that would be my addition.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4039.976s">I</a>  guess I'm a stakeholder. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4041.096s">That</a>  would be my addition. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4042.157s">I</a>  certainly would bring that up in any kind of discussion, but I can tell you that I don't share your full assessment of our bathroom facilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4049.741s">There</a>  may be a few that need some additional work, but there's a lot of them that work very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4054.182s">They're</a>  in good shape and are being cleaned on a regular basis.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4056.344s">That's</a>  my exact point. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4058.185s">I</a>  know you don't share them and that's why they've been in deplorable condition for so many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4062.669s">That's</a>  my exact point, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4066.152s">So</a>  we can go back and forth on that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4069.335s">And</a>  also, Mr. Superintendent, you were here several months back when we were talking about safety at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4075.821s">We</a>  had a great debate going back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4078.683s">and</a>  I see you mentioned in the SOI that you have the inability to close off certain parts of the building and have the inability to keep it cordoned off to people from outside and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4092.01s">I'm</a>  glad to see that you're finally admitting that there is a security issue at the high school and that there is concern, Mr. Superintendent, with access to that building throughout the course of the day and that we've been unable to control the access <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4108.285s">And</a>  I'm glad to see that you're offering some solutions to that effect, Mr. Superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4113.546s">So</a>  for the record, I'm going to tell you the high school is a safe place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4117.167s">There's</a>  always more we can do to improve it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4120.508s">And</a>  some of the things we have here will add dimensions that we can't do by ourselves.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4131.691s">That's</a>  all for now, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4133.431s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4135.812s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4136.892s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4138.772s">President</a>  Caraviello, I think it's important that we do, as a group, as a city council, understand what the immediate needs are, a five-year plan, and I think, that was my question in the beginning, and it's not really answered, and I have to review on this in depth, it does seem like everything is included, but when you stated that when the state comes in, you will let them know what the priorities are, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4167.248s">I</a>  would just request through the chair that we do get a top five, top 10 list of things that need to be done and maybe why they need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4177.751s">Nothing</a>  extensive, just the first thing we would need is a, just so we could better understand what those 10 things are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4185.573s">If</a>  the state is going to give us money, I think the city council, who will have to agree or disagree to bond for it, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4194.47s">should</a>  know that up front before we submit something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4198.573s">I</a>  think that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4199.774s">Number</a>  two, I just agree with Councilor Marks in the respect with regards to putting everything in the kitchen sink into this document, because we were told that we can't afford a fire station until 2022, 23, 24, and the fire department was also promised to be almost the next on the list <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4223.4s">So</a>  the administration told us that we can't afford probably a number of these larger items unless it's, you know, obviously a substantial need like a leaking roof or a blown boiler. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4236.903s">So</a>  I would hate to have one of these larger projects that is not necessarily a necessity be approved and us be given a grant and then we come and see 500 students here advocating for <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4251.458s">that</a>  500-person cafeteria or something that's almost a novelty that we can't afford and then have 75 firefighters in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4258.4s">But</a>  wait, saying wait, we were promised a new station, a healthy, safe environment for us to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4265.282s">And</a>  that's the way politics runs in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4267.423s">It's</a>  not going to be up to all the elected body. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4271.004s">How</a>  it's worked is it's going to come before the council to take that tough vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4275.846s">So</a>  whether or not, I think this needs to be narrowed down just a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4280.401s">Because</a>  I understand both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4281.961s">I</a>  understand you want to include everything your staff and administration wants in the document. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4286.502s">But</a>  it's a lie. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4287.722s">We</a>  can't afford all these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4289.703s">And</a>  what we should be able to afford are the necessities, health, safety, and obviously the security within that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4297.785s">And</a>  that should be what's in this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4299.765s">And</a>  that's what I'd be comfortable approving tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4303.126s">And</a>  you would have my approval if it was narrowed down a little bit to maybe the top 10 items that need to be done at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4310.489s">and</a>  then we can do the necessities, do things that need to be done within the next five, six, seven years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4317.673s">So</a>  I mean, I agree, and I think that's some, those are two points, two things maybe that I think we should have before us, maybe a little updated document, a little less extravagant, and then also just a top 10 list of what needs to be done, what we're gonna need to do within the next five to 10 years, so that we can say, yes, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4340.622s">good</a>  request, and then see what the state is willing to give us, because we cannot afford, we were told we cannot afford 10 extra million now, and we won't be able to afford it until we do the fire station, and then at that point, we won't be able to afford a library, and basically what I heard is we won't be able to afford a lot of these items in this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4361.297s">So</a>  I'd rather ask for, hey, state, please, we need a roof, we need a new electrical system in A building, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4369.093s">These</a>  things are going to, obviously, we need them evaluated, and they're going to fall apart, or are going to have to be replaced within the next five to 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4376.816s">And</a>  I would ask the council to really think about that, because that's a situation we're going to face, or whoever's sitting behind this rail, four, five, three years from now, if we do get the monies for an extravagant item that we just really can't afford, that the kids are going to want so badly, and the administration's going to want. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4395.184s">But</a>  will they need it, and will we be able to afford it? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4398.486s">And</a>  we were told, no, it's not going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4400.286s">So</a>  let's, I think we need to be a little bit more realistic.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4405.367s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4406.847s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4408.268s">I</a>  think we're getting the cut way, way, way ahead of the horse here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4413.148s">If</a>  we look at the history of the Medford City Council, just several weeks ago, we voted unanimously for the administration to hire a grant writer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4420.03s">Before</a>  us right here, we have a grant that's been written and an opportunity to let the school department go and explore options and opportunities for the city to be given free money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4429.992s">I</a>  don't think that's a bad thing, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4432.154s">We</a>  get elected to make tough decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4434.315s">And</a>  if there comes a point in time when there's a room full of students and a room full of firefighters that are sitting here arguing about whose project is going to get funded, I think that everybody behind this rail is committed to the understanding that public safety is our first priority, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4446.965s">But</a>  we will be the ones that have to make that tough decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4449.487s">But</a>  that's what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4452.369s">Ultimately,</a>  Mr. President, all this is, is the school district seeking permission to go and sit down and have a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4460.302s">That's</a>  what this is, the school district sitting down to have a conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4463.585s">As</a>  such, Mr. President, I've made a motion to move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4465.827s">I</a>  make a motion to end all debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4467.568s">Move</a>  the question.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4622.838s">Mr.</a>  President, I had the floor before that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4625.121s">No,</a>  Councilor Dullos, you...

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4643.413s">I</a>  do, mister, I have a question for the superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4645.434s">Speak.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4645.574s">Are</a>  we here tonight? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4646.474s">Speak.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4646.974s">To</a>  discuss, the superintendent came up here, took his time out of his busy schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4650.096s">No</a>  one's denying you an opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4652.917s">We're</a>  just trying to deny freedom of speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4654.478s">I</a>  was not trying to deny you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4655.978s">The</a>  people, the board spoke, and you were able to speak.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4659.119s">The</a>  board spoke is right, and I'm thankful for my colleagues that know what this legislative process is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4664.722s">You</a>  have the floor, Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4666.042s">I</a>  know I do, thank you, keep them interrupting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4670.304s">And</a>  I wanna thank my colleagues, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4673.197s">that</a>  had the gumption, Mr. President, to allow this dialogue to keep going on and not be rubber stamps. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4682.882s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, are you willing to put together a priority list, as Councilor Wendell Kern mentioned, in the SOI? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4690.446s">It</a>  seems like this is an ongoing, fluid discussion with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4694.508s">Are</a>  you willing to do that?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4696.469s">I</a>  think that the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4698.847s">would</a>  meet to talk about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4700.467s">And</a>  we could sit together, because I'm not going to speak solely for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4705.408s">They</a>  have a right to determine what they would consider priorities within this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4710.389s">And</a>  they're not going to meet for another two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4712.69s">And</a>  so I think that that slows this down. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4714.85s">This</a>  is due in a very short period of time into the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4718.671s">And</a>  I think that we can always send you a priority list afterwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4722.451s">But</a>  the things we would prioritize in our discussions with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4726.567s">But</a>  I think you should allow us to go forward and to get this going. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4730.749s">I</a>  mean, it doesn't hurt. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4731.769s">You're</a>  not committing anything in terms of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4735.351s">You're</a>  just allowing us to submit an application to the state so that we can be heard with their team that evaluates issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4744.915s">And</a>  they won't even get to us for a couple of months, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4748.697s">They</a>  won't even get to us for a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4751.038s">But</a>  having said that, we have to be in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4753.999s">Because</a>  there are other communities going to submit as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4756.742s">And</a>  if we're not in, we don't get any consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4760.185s">So</a>  I think I'll be happy to bring that up with the school committee to give you some sort of what they consider priorities within this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4768.35s">But</a>  I don't think you should stop it tonight.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4771.012s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4773.034s">And</a>  I don't think anyone behind this reeling, and I'll speak for myself, was looking to stop this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4778.658s">We</a>  were looking to ask questions, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4781.72s">And</a>  that's not confused questioning with being in opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4786.347s">It's</a>  part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4788.509s">It's</a>  part of the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4789.469s">I</a>  know this is an early step, and it's the first step, and now we're hearing April 7th is the deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4794.934s">No</a>  surprise, not for you, but no surprise to this council, because we're always presented with, oh, the deadline's next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4802.039s">Make</a>  a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4803.38s">You</a>  can't table it for a week, because the deadline's next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4806.523s">So</a>  we're always presented that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4808.524s">But</a>  I'm not going to stand in the way of this tonight, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4811.947s">I</a>  think what Councilor Lungo-Koehn offered <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4813.907s">about</a>  going back, and if you need to go back to the school committee and get a priority list, I think that's a great suggestion, Mr. Superintendent, to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4822.053s">And</a>  I would ask that that be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4824.035s">And</a>  I would also ask that this council be privy to any discussions that you are having with the state regarding projects, of which projects may be taken off the board, which projects may be added to the SOI. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4838.613s">So</a>  we're up to date and not just presented something on the last hour again for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4844.538s">And</a>  I would ask that you keep this council privy to that information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4850.143s">I</a>  certainly have no problem with any of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4851.965s">I</a>  think, you know, look, let's not kid ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4854.607s">Any</a>  project to go forward needs a school committee, needs the mayor, needs the city council, and needs the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4861.792s">So</a>  there's a lot of deliberation that's going to have to take place and a lot of prioritization that's going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4867.357s">But</a>  if you're only asking me to go back to the school committee and sit down and ask them to tell you what's most important to them, happy to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4874.463s">I</a>  think that that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4876.845s">But</a>  I don't think we should stop getting in on the <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4882.215s">into</a>  the state with this so we can continue to move and get them to come out to us sooner rather than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4887.096s">Because</a>  everybody's going to be submitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4889.576s">And</a>  if we're the last one in the door, maybe our review date doesn't happen until August, September, October, whatever the case may be.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4898.298s">I</a>  was told, just so you know, there's no priority according to when the SOI is received. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4902.899s">So</a>  whether the last one in the door, first one in the door, second one in the door, I was also told that they're not going to look at applications or make any recommendations until December. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4911.85s">of</a>  2017, so there's plenty of time, and I'm just asking that we be part of any discussions that are ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4919.482s">You</a>  will have my support here tonight, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4922.971s">I</a>  could just tell you eventually, and as a longtime member of this council, eventually when something comes before us, whether it's a year, two or three years before us, and if it does, if and when it does require, maybe require a proposition two and a half override, you will not have my support. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4941.8s">And</a>  I just want to let that be known right now because I'm not going to hold back any punches. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4947.914s">You</a>  know, I voted not to have the combined center because we were told that it would require a proposition two and a half override for the police and fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4958.058s">And,</a>  you know, we have a library coming down the pike pretty soon with some grant funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4963.921s">We're</a>  going to have this project, and eventually we're going to have the fire department coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4967.662s">So</a>  I would just ask that whatever's done, that it stay within the confines of our budget without a proposition two and a half override.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4977.693s">I</a>  respect your right to make those decisions, and, you know, I understand them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4981.975s">I</a>  mean, I'm not a rookie. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4983.736s">I've</a>  been here a long time, and I've been in and out of these meetings many times, asking for funding and other forms of support. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4991.28s">So</a>  I respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4993.181s">But</a>  it's important that you know your options, and that's all I'm asking you to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=4996.983s">Know</a>  your options.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5000.625s">Counsel</a>  Max, are you finished? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5001.745s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5003.686s">Counsel</a>  De La Rosa.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5005.947s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5008.155s">And</a>  thank you, Mr. Superintendent, for your leadership and your clarity and your foresight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5014.457s">The</a>  way I understand this request, it is to get us, as you've presented, into the door and to have items for discussion on the table for us to see what can be funded and what we can receive help with. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5027.622s">I'm</a>  all in favor of a priority list from the school board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5033.304s">My</a>  concern with priority lists from anybody is that they be responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5038.203s">and</a>  that they have in mind a larger picture that though this body makes the final decision that we all share a responsibility in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5052.248s">I</a>  approve of this request and I will support it, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5057.35s">I</a>  must say that I hope that when we get into further discussion on how or <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5064.133s">in</a>  what way some of this money and some of these grants might be directed, that we're able to address some of the money that we've spent in the past on the same thing several times. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5079.837s">It</a>  seems as though we're chasing leaks in those roofs and replacing them and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on those roofs in a frequent manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5090.14s">I'm</a>  concerned about that, and I hope we can get to the bottom of the top of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5095.544s">And</a>  so I think I've said enough, and I think perhaps we've heard enough tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5101.589s">And</a>  so I'd like to move approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5104.751s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5105.652s">Mr.</a>  President, just one quick thing to counsel, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5109.194s">Just</a>  that we did an infrared study of the high school roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5112.757s">We</a>  will repair those things that need to be repaired for about $25,000 this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5118.201s">OK,</a>  that's about all we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5120.179s">The</a>  long-term renovation or repair or reconstruction of the roof is five to six years out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5127.365s">And,</a>  you know, if we were to take it to the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5129.747s">So</a>  that's really where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5131.908s">We</a>  had a couple of very difficult snow periods a few years ago where shoveling was required on the roof to avoid collapse and the like that may have done some damage in certain areas, and we need to repair those. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5143.658s">But</a>  other than that, the roof's got another five, six years.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5146.54s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5148.081s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5149.943s">Mr.</a>  Caraviello, through the chair, I just want to ask for clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5152.885s">So</a>  we're asking for a priority list and we're asking, I mean, I guess it would be a good compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5158.569s">Are</a>  we asking to keep the document as is and then put the priority list in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5163.672s">Did</a>  you state that, Councilor Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5165.434s">Put</a>  the priority list within the application? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5172.578s">I</a>  thought I heard you say that it will be within the document.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5175.625s">We</a>  could put in the document, or the superintendent says he sits down and meets with the state, so I have no problem with him presenting the priority list. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5183.548s">So</a>  it doesn't, I don't care about the avenue it gets to the state.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5188.229s">Okay,</a>  yeah, I just would like to add that, that our priority list that is drafted within the next week or two, even be added as an attachment to the application, so that the state knows, yes, we're looking for everything, but these are our top, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5204.678s">whatever</a>  it might be, 10, 11, 12 things that we need done within the next five to 10 years that we're going to be putting money forward anyway for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5211.742s">And</a>  we would love some state reimbursement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5215.404s">I</a>  think that I'd just like to add that to the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5218.265s">And</a>  I'd also like to just point out that I think I heard that this document maybe was produced in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5223.888s">And</a>  I think the school committee voted on it on the 6th of February, which was a month and a half ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5228.871s">And</a>  for some reason, it came before us tonight with only a week or two left before it's actually due. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5234.696s">So</a>  in the future, it would be nice to, obviously the school committee has the right to review and to discuss first, but a little bit sooner so that maybe we could prepare a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5245.14s">We</a>  got it on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5246.201s">I</a>  think a lot of us review our packet over the weekend, leaving us only a couple days to form questions, do research, make calls, and get the questions we want answered before we have to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5255.685s">And</a>  it always just feels, not just, no offense to the superintendent, but no matter what we're presented, half the time, especially if it's something important, we're giving it <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5264.689s">the</a>  week of and it's just not the right way to run a city and to be transparent with not only us as the people who are elected to make the votes, but to the people who are electing us who are going to come and ask us the questions or who asks us the questions after they hear the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5281.18s">So</a>  I think just think in the future and I'll say that all the time and whether or not it happens, highly unlikely, but I think it's extremely important to be more transparent and to give the city council more time for review.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5294.208s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5294.588s">So</a>  Mr. President, if I could just respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5296.87s">I</a>  mean, I feel I have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5298.611s">The</a>  document you're referring to in September was a different document. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5301.532s">That's</a>  the capital plan that came from the mayor through the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5305.315s">The</a>  document you have in front of you was approved by the school committee on February 6th after a committee of the whole meeting that they had the week before on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5314.96s">And</a>  you received it, what do you call it, tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5318.879s">because,</a>  what do you call it, you were busy dealing with other capital considerations, in particular the police station and other things like that, so they confused those two items. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5326.95s">But</a>  the reality is that that's the two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5330.315s">And</a>  the other point I guess I would make is that the state has a form. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5334.731s">We</a>  filled out the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5336.132s">You</a>  don't add to the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5337.994s">We'll</a>  be happy to provide that priority list to them, but the form is the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5342.678s">That's</a>  what you submit. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5344.079s">You</a>  don't add things to an application that is not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5347.782s">I</a>  think that would be not consistent with the way you make a submittal. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5355.388s">But</a>  certainly, we respect the right that the council has asked, and we certainly will honor that, to come up with a priority list, provide it to you, and provide it to MSBA, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5364.367s">as</a>  part of the discussions that take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5366.888s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5367.288s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5368.548s">I</a>  would, uh, my point was to be, uh, in support of that priority list attachment in so much as it, uh, it doesn't act as a hindrance or as an appropriate in that forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5381.172s">I,</a>  uh, trust that the superintendent, uh, through the process of meetings, uh, with the authority and, uh, his presence and his negotiating skills won't lead us to be bamboozled.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5395.019s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor DelaRosso. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5397.22s">And</a>  Mr. Superintendent, I thank you for your leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5399.602s">Our</a>  technical school and high school has moved forward in the last few years under your guidance, and I hope to see it continue moving forward.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5405.706s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5409.668s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5412.19s">Excuse</a>  me, Mr. Penta, the gentleman was first.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5418.574s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5420.115s">David</a>  McKillop, 94 Rock Glen Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5422.996s">I</a>  was listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5424.473s">all</a>  the conversation tonight, and I guess being a business person, I'm all about planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5431.139s">It</a>  seems to be that for whatever reason, we're struggling with planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5435.302s">One</a>  of the things that really strikes me as curious is the MSBA. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5440.126s">The</a>  MSBA was presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5441.848s">Now,</a>  when it was presented is the question, because if it was presented <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5446.511s">Two</a>  months ago, six months ago, a year ago, then you may have had the opportunity to actually get more information a lot sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5453.495s">So</a>  that should be a question that should be asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5455.616s">When</a>  is the MSBA turn around and say, hey, when does the door open?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5460.939s">Mr.</a>  Subbotin, can you answer the gentleman's question?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5465.282s">The</a>  MSBA opens up a window for statements of interest in January and then expects it to <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5473.206s">follow</a>  through by the April date. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5475.569s">They</a>  actually pushed it out a little bit this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5477.151s">Normally</a>  it's in March, but they open up the window for the SOIs in January.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5481.737s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5482.679s">So</a>  that's the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5483.98s">So</a>  if it's being opened up in January, the meeting is being done in February, the finalization is then, now it's March, April, really the window is much, much smaller than you might actually anticipate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5493.802s">So</a>  the question isn't answered in the respect of how to plan this better. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5497.323s">So</a>  now, to be proactive, the next time the MSBA opens up, I think as a city council, I personally, if it were me, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5506.113s">would</a>  say, hey, the next time this opens, we want from day one to know when and how and what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5513.157s">We</a>  want to be part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5514.638s">So</a>  when the school committee goes into the committee of the whole, the discussion is made, you're already aware something's going to be coming to your desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5522.702s">And</a>  I think that would help. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5524.443s">To</a>  me, again, looking at a business perspective, I've been in business for 14 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5532.212s">My</a>  business needs a facelift really, really bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5534.954s">So</a>  if you guys want to help me with that, please contribute. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5537.995s">But</a>  in order to do that, four years ago, I had to start planning for this coming year, not 2017, 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5546.36s">Four</a>  years ago, I started to put that plan together. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5548.461s">Four</a>  years ago, I did a cost analysis. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5550.682s">Four</a>  years ago, we started to meet with people that could help us put this project together. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5556.145s">This</a>  year we're meeting with a designer who's going to take an entire year to put this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5560.892s">So</a>  I don't understand how we're looking at the police station, the fire station, the high school, and we're saying, oh my God. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5570.63s">The</a>  world is coming to an end today when this has been happening for 10, 15, 20, 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5576.734s">So</a>  the other thing I ask is, where's the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5580.856s">We</a>  just heard that it would be five years out for a new roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5584.999s">Where's</a>  the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5586.44s">Do</a>  we have a plan in front of us? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5588.381s">Do</a>  we know how much it's gonna cost in five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5590.462s">Have</a>  we started to map that out? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5592.944s">Are</a>  we planning for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5595.505s">Secondly</a>  is, if we're going to get 40 more years out of this high school, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5601.143s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5602.403s">What's</a>  the plan in 40 years? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5604.484s">What's</a>  the new high school? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5606.025s">Let's</a>  be visionaries and let's try to figure out how we can make this happen in the future for all of the people that are voting for you and all the people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5614.768s">Because</a>  I look at Medford as a gateway city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5617.689s">Cambridge</a>  is maxed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5619.15s">Somerville's</a>  maxed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5620.51s">This</a>  is the next city on the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5622.751s">You</a>  want it to be Medford or do you want it to be Malden or do you want it to be Everett? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5626.618s">I</a>  think you guys really have to take a look at that and start planning ahead and putting your best foot forward, because if you don't start investing now, it's going to catch up later on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5636.42s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5637.741s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5642.022s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5643.502s">Robert</a>  Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5647.803s">With</a>  all due respect to the superintendent, I appreciate the fact that he was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5651.864s">Knowing</a>  that in January that the application is out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5655.078s">And</a>  knowing that the school committee met, I believe, a week before February 6th, it really doesn't give much time, whether it be for the school committee or even before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5663.504s">You</a>  know, and this is something I believe, Mr. President, that you should have been advised of in a joint meeting between the school committee and the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5670.66s">While</a>  the council may have a lot of priorities and financial obligations to meet, that should be not an excuse or a red herring to say that's the reason why they didn't sit down or bring this out sooner. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5680.387s">It's</a>  not right, it's not fair, it doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5683.048s">The</a>  job is here to deal with everything that this city involves you with. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5686.651s">Finances,</a>  education, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5688.892s">And</a>  if you have to meet more than one night a week, wow, what a shame that would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5692.735s">Maybe</a>  if you met three or four times a week and you made the mayor become involved in all of this and make you to become involved with this, you'd have a better handle on what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5701.46s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, you state on your document that you are submitting, you state, the school which is structurally unsound or otherwise in a condition seriously jeopardizing the health and safety of school children where no alternatives exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5717.25s">You</a>  go on further to state that the renovation that took place in 2013 regarding the science labs for which the Medford City Council discussed on more than one night, I believe it was four times, and as a result of that, part of that was because of recertification with the Commonwealth of Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5733.438s">And</a>  further, the fact of the matter is that the building has not since then been renovated to meet ADA compliance standards and fire code standards that are needed to be current. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5744.169s">Now,</a>  how can our city allow that building right now not to go forward and have those requirements met? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5752.576s">That</a>  should be something that the school committee addresses on an annual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5756.98s">That's</a>  an everyday thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5757.88s">You're</a>  talking about the safety of the children in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5761.463s">You</a>  indicate at that point in time, you indicate that the fire code would be approximately $1,200,000 to do an upgrade on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5767.288s">You</a>  also indicated <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5771.942s">that</a>  there is no way to close off the sections of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5775.543s">to</a>  prevent citizens to enter restricted areas during non-school hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5779.565s">You</a>  can go back to 1991, when I was sitting up there as president of the council, and that was an issue that was presented to us as it relates to out-of-towners coming to Medford High School that were not certified to be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5790.411s">And</a>  in 2012, it was Councilman Marks who brought up the issue regarding the community schools on people coming in and out of the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5797.875s">And</a>  now you're talking about maybe having a program that cuts down the entrances, where and how you can get in? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5804.103s">You</a>  can walk up to that high school right now at any point in time, after hours, and walk into that building, and there's nobody there to check you in or to check you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5812.448s">It's</a>  totally unfair. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5813.228s">It's</a>  not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5814.929s">I</a>  can appreciate the fact that you might want to do all of these things now, but I beg the question, where has the school committee been on each and every one of these budgets, on each and every one of these years, especially on ADA compliance, especially on fire code compliance? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5831.95s">That's</a>  the thing that's necessary each and every day, that a child goes to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5836.253s">That's</a>  what you pay your taxes for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5837.974s">That's</a>  what a parent believes their elected officials are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5841.056s">They're</a>  making sure and ensuring that their children are protected when they go to school each and every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5848.423s">Mr.</a>  Belson further stated, with all due respect, that in next year's budget he's going to put a dollar amount in there for school renovations or school upgradings, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5859.373s">We've</a>  been talking about this thing for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5861.555s">The</a>  new school building program had a 5% annual charge that the city was supposed to put in each and every one of those new buildings to maintain themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5871.204s">And</a>  now, Councilor Caraviello, Mr. President, it's well over a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5874.607s">The</a>  buildings are less than, they're going on 14 to 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5877.549s">We're</a>  right back to where you were in the beginning as the reason why you had to build new schools, because the maintenance didn't take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5884.335s">Granted,</a>  Medford High School is a big school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5886.337s">It's</a>  a big school to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5888.739s">But</a>  you've got three roofs, three brand new roofs on that building, and now you're looking at a fourth one. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5895.925s">The</a>  question then becomes, is the quality of the work not right? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5901.053s">Are</a>  we not checking out to make sure that the quality of the work is not right? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5904.735s">Are</a>  we just paying to have something done? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5909.297s">Another</a>  part that I really think that needs to take place to be discussed is the fact that, you know, this is such an important issue because this isn't a million dollars or two million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5921.342s">This</a>  is well in excess of your $10 million, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5925.144s">The</a>  school committee should be here sitting with you <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5928.478s">And</a>  you, Mr. President, I would hope you would call for a joint meeting between the school committee to consider as you go forward on this particular project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5936.584s">You</a>  people got hit with this cold turkey tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5938.705s">You</a>  should have been called ahead of time to have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5942.628s">It's</a>  before the bodies, before the public here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5946.871s">And</a>  to shut off debate on millions of dollars being discussed is wrong.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5952.575s">Debate</a>  was not shut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5955.377s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5957.564s">It's</a>  not relative to millions and millions of dollars, it's relative to whether or not we're going to authorize the school district to sit down and meet with the Massachusetts School Building Assistance Program to determine whether or not there are any grant funding opportunities that are competitive in nature for the city of Medford to pursue.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5971.779s">And</a>  if that be the case, that's a dollar amount attached to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5975.961s">Because</a>  the application before the school building assistance program, no matter what they allow, is going to have a dollar amount attached to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5981.724s">That</a>  dollar amount has to be paid for by the city as to what portion of it they're going to accept, if not all of it or part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5988.567s">It's</a>  a dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5990.108s">You</a>  should never shut off anybody, colleague or citizen, at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5993.49s">This</a>  is the only place you have an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5995.071s">Nobody</a>  was shut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5996.091s">I</a>  just said you should not shut off anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=5998.573s">There</a>  was an attempt to end debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6000.334s">Nobody</a>  was shut off. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6001.454s">I</a>  said there was an attempt to end debate, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6017.143s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6017.904s">Robert's</a>  Rules of Order also allows <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6020.258s">Public</a>  participation, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6021.758s">Public</a>  participation is allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6023.579s">I</a>  don't want to hear it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6025.979s">What</a>  is that, a threat?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6027.8s">Is</a>  that a threat, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6029.8s">I</a>  have a right to say what I want.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6041.142s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6042.182s">This</a>  is a meeting of the Medford City Council.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6044.563s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6045.787s">Mr.</a>  President, Mr. Belson also alluded to the fact that, and he's probably right in part, but he says we need to be partners with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6052.252s">We</a>  need to be partners between and amongst ourselves, council, school committee people, to get the best of ideas that need to go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6058.116s">I</a>  can appreciate the fact that he wants to submit something now and you can't change it because the form is there, but it's been hanging around since January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6064.721s">That's</a>  the sad part, since January of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6067.244s">School</a>  committee allegedly only met once, if I understand that correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6070.547s">And</a>  if that be the case to discuss it, they probably didn't have the same opportunities, and I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6075.01s">Maybe</a>  the superintendent presented what he thought the priorities might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6077.632s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6078.453s">None</a>  of us know, because we haven't had that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6080.975s">That's</a>  why not having joint meetings with our other legislative body hurts the process that's before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6086.899s">It</a>  hurts the idea that you can get a better idea as to why and how it's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6091.201s">You</a>  get a better idea what the cost is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6093.402s">You</a>  can get a better idea what the priorities are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6095.602s">As</a>  the gentleman just came up here, Mr. McAuliffe, as he relates to the fact of how he has to run his business and what he has to plan for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6103.266s">No</a>  matter what the outcome is of this, whether they give you $1 million, $5 million, or $6 million, worthy, worthy of work to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6110.957s">You</a>  still have no priority program as it relates to any comprehensive financial program as to where this city is going. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6118.288s">Police,</a>  fire, retirement board that needs to be paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6121.951s">The</a>  deficit as it relates to the retirement fund, $28 million that the city has. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6126.754s">Again,</a>  nobody wants to discuss that and how you're going to go forward with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6129.917s">And</a>  more importantly, a fire and police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6131.898s">Does</a>  that mean now fire and police are going to be separated? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6134.72s">Or</a>  is it not going to be separated? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6136.601s">You</a>  haven't even gotten a final answer as it relates to the police department going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6140.423s">If</a>  they take down the station over there for the training tower for the fire department, and you're going to go to a regional location, that's going to put the fire department at issue for backup, because they're going to have to send their truck and their men to that regional location. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6154.91s">A</a>  public safety issue.</p>

    <p>[3UkqIlWnJXM_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6157.951s">One</a>  information, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6160.452s">Training</a>  tower is being addressed by a working group that's headed up by the chief and made up of members of the fire department's training division. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6166.436s">I</a>  do also believe that their wish, inclination, desire, and focus is to have a training tower that's located in the city of Medford that may be open to regional communities.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6177.263s">However,</a>  it would be maintained, dictated, and controlled by the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6180.785s">That's</a>  based upon some meetings that I've had with the training team and the administration, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6186.068s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6187.269s">Mr.</a>  President, the Medford Public Schools <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6190.216s">as</a>  in the commentary from the superintendent, would like to meet with state and local governments as it relates to current code, including fire doors, fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and safety conditions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6200.833s">All</a>  things that right now are in potential violation are, if not in violation, as we presently speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6206.456s">After</a>  the new, I believe we all can remember, after the new science labs were built, there was a major problem for almost a year where a fire person had to be up at the high school because the fire system, the fire alarm system didn't work as it related to something happened, whether through the electrical department or what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6222.303s">Then,</a>  if I understand this correctly, in Mr. Belson's commentary, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6228.352s">And</a>  I agree with you 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6230.033s">You</a>  said any decision regarding the specific projects and the financial commitments would be developed over time and after multiple meetings within city government and at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6242.017s">Well,</a>  at least he's got the ability to understand and recognize that city government officials need to sit down and discuss it, much more than the person who calls herself the mayor of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6253.605s">This</a>  is a big issue, whether you want to realize it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6257.066s">The</a>  building is 50 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6258.747s">You're</a>  talking about the same fire and police station that's down there right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6261.928s">Maintenance</a>  didn't take place in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6264.089s">Now,</a>  a lot of these things are maintenance driven, whether they be fire, whether they be the windows, whether they be the boiler or what have you, the asbestos. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6271.092s">It's</a>  a big building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6271.793s">I</a>  think it's four and a half miles long, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6275.274s">550,000</a>  square feet, whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6277.915s">It</a>  was built at a time to be a college campus type of a school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6283.069s">But</a>  that's not the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6284.69s">You're</a>  getting a lot of this all at once. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6287.172s">Maybe,</a>  to some degree, maybe, whether it's the cafeteria or whatever the auditorium is that they... Maybe if you just stuck to the real desperate needs that the building has on a slow annual basis, you can look at these other things and put them into the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6303.242s">Let</a>  me just remind you, and I'll just leave you with this last thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6306.144s">Just</a>  look at the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6307.785s">Look</a>  at all the development that's taken place over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6311.187s">All</a>  the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6312.978s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6314.299s">Many,</a>  many more jobs, and their taxes keep on going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6319.481s">You</a>  don't have that opportunity here in the city of Medford, because if we're going to follow the mainstream of Somerville and taxing the citizens of this community to pay for bond indebtedness that you can't afford, and as Council Marks and others have alluded to, you're going to get yourself into a Proposition 2.5 override, it'll lose. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6336.748s">Everyone</a>  behind this council, I guarantee you, will lose if you'll be supportive of that, if you're serving at that point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6342.334s">You</a>  need to plan ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6344.095s">And</a>  when you plan ahead, you'll be able to address these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6347.117s">These</a>  have been long overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6348.478s">This</a>  is a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6349.678s">Prior</a>  school committees ought to hang their head in embarrassment for allowing this to go this long. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6354.481s">And</a>  so should the city of Medford, because that's been their downfall, letting their buildings run into a demise situation year in and year out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6362.726s">And</a>  now you're going to pay the price for it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6364.667s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6366.368s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6367.929s">Mr.</a>  President, move the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6370.611s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6372.131s">As</a>  amended, Mr. Belson, do you want to finish up with anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6375.434s">I</a>  just want to finish a couple of quick statements, if I may, with your permission. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6379.817s">First</a>  of all, some of the things that were quoted were quoted as the priorities of the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6386.963s">When</a>  they say the building structurally unsound, that's not what we're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6390.566s">That's</a>  what the state is using as a category for things that you can put things under. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6395.29s">When</a>  the building says that the renovation of schools such as roofs, that's what they're saying you can ask for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6400.485s">That's</a>  not what we're saying is our need. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6403.027s">That's</a>  the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6404.147s">As</a>  far as handicapped accessibility, we put in three elevators, ramps, we've made the Little Theater or the Karen Theater now handicapped accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6412.133s">The</a>  building is handicapped accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6414.294s">There</a>  are a lot of things, and with all due respect to, I understand there's a give and take here, but the reality is that a lot of improvements have been made to that high school and that technical school, and you have helped to pay for it over the years as a city council and as a school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6428.802s">The</a>  school committee had a right, when this thing came out, to deliberate and determine what it considered to be important and to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6437.126s">And</a>  they had a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6438.426s">And</a>  they then had a follow-up meeting where they voted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6442.448s">You're</a>  getting it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6443.689s">And</a>  all we're asking is for you to allow us to submit it so we can then begin a process of finding out what's possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6450.832s">And</a>  then we can have a more robust interactive process between council, school committee, mayor, administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6457.661s">to</a>  determine what this city considers important, what this city wants to fund on its own, what this city wants to partner with, and what we're going to do in what time frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6466.764s">And</a>  that's all we're looking for tonight.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6765.616s">Yes,</a>  we currently have a cast-iron main that goes up through a lot that's for a new waypoint building going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6772.282s">We</a>  need to relocate 52 feet of 4-inch down the street, about 100 feet to cross, so it goes into the easement for a new main to go up the side so they can do their construction safely.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6781.789s">And</a>  this is Winthrop Street up by Smith Lane, is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6785.472s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6786.433s">And</a>  how much of the street will you be digging up?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6877.62s">That</a>  would be under the direction of the engineering department from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6881.224s">That</a>  has not been discussed yet, but we do a pre-construction walk once it's been approved by yourself.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6885.128s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6886.309s">Now,</a>  has anyone in the engineering department talked about the, I believe that street's going to be <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6893.576s">dug</a>  up again in a few weeks, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6896.017s">Is</a>  it maybe a few months?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6897.597s">Yeah,</a>  coming down the lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6899.398s">Is</a>  it three years? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6900.078s">Yeah,</a>  a year or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6900.978s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6901.378s">So</a>  again, I think just reiterating, just making sure that the sidewalk, you know, anything that's where people are walking, excuse me, the street, that it's put back where, and then revisited again in six months, making sure that there was no dippage or, you know, so any future holes later. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6923.617s">Understood.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6924.037s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6925.097s">Um,</a>  everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6926.098s">See,</a>  that's an order. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6926.958s">So</a>  I move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6929.618s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, uh, I am sure Mr. Kamadi is familiar with the area in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6936.48s">Um,</a>  and I'm sure he's also aware that we do have a public school in the vicinity of the location where they're going to be doing construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6943.921s">Um,</a>  it's my understanding as he just stated that the construction schedule will be up to the office of the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6949.262s">Um,</a>  I'd ask the city engineering office by way of an amendment or a second paper, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6953.829s">restrict</a>  the construction during the rush hour periods when schools drop off and school pickup is occurring, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6960.158s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6961.359s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6967.407s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6968.769s">Will</a>  there be any limitations for people using the driveways?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6972.658s">If</a>  there is anyone affected during the day for their driveways, our foreman on site will coordinate with them to let them know when they can go in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6978.86s">If</a>  not, we can also put a plate down for them to access the driveway, but only be for a day period, if anything, and they'd be notified prior.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6986.043s">So</a>  when will they receive notification?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6989.064s">48</a>  hours in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6990.485s">The</a>  new foreman will try to notify, leave a door hanger out on the door if they're going to be in front. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=6995.627s">We</a>  also post no parking signs in the location that we will be trenching for that day to let residents know.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7002.357s">And</a>  are there any expectations regarding the traffic flow? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7005.819s">Are</a>  you going to have to close a partial lane? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7008.24s">Or</a>  is there any consideration with that?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7012.203s">We</a>  should be able to keep two lanes of traffic flowing since our new installation will be in the curb line closer to the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7018.606s">So</a>  we won't have any issue keeping traffic flow. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7021.388s">As</a>  many details are needed will be directed by direction of the captain. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7024.91s">And</a>  whatever is needed for traffic flow, we certainly will do.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7027.531s">So</a>  you already have a detailed plan from the police department?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7031.155s">That</a>  is an on-site meeting that takes place at the start of the job.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7035.519s">Say</a>  that again?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7036.479s">The</a>  direction of how traffic is set up is an on-site meeting that happens at the prior or at the start of the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7041.884s">Because</a>  the beginning of the job is only verification holes, which is a very small portion of the roadway that will be taken up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7047.668s">Before</a>  trenching begins, it is under that direction.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7049.65s">So</a>  prior to Monday, because you said Monday the construction is going to start?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7053.033s">Once</a>  this is approved, then we can move forward with anything that needs to be done prior to construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7056.596s">But</a>  we need approval from the council first.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7058.735s">Right,</a>  but that traffic impact of mitigation will take place prior to the start date. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7065.599s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7065.959s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7067.58s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7067.961s">Councilor</a>  Knight, when the streets resurfaced, who's responsible for the striping? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7073.884s">We</a>  normally are responsible for the striping, unless the city has future plans.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7077.807s">And</a>  you are aware that there is a bike lane that's been put along Winthrop Street in that vicinity? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7084.831s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7085.171s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7085.992s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7087.467s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7088.027s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, as seconded by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7092.308s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7093.048s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7093.888s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7096.049s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7097.149s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7117.64s">Mr.</a>  President, I put this forward two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7121.303s">I</a>  guess it was wishful thinking, then the snow came, and here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7124.826s">It's</a>  not spring yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7126.368s">However,</a>  I'm just wondering when the DPW is going to go out and begin restriping our crosswalks and our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7133.714s">We</a>  have some faded paint out there that is annually in the need of repair and replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7139.279s">And</a>  I would like the DPW commissioner to provide us with a schedule as to when that is going to occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7144.043s">I'd</a>  ask my council colleagues to <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7145.86s">join</a>  me in supporting this resolution and move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7150.224s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7150.884s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7152.245s">If</a>  I can just add on to that, I know that it might be, I know that, uh, Mr. Cairns did respond to us about Evans street, but didn't respond back on Paris street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7162.374s">So</a>  if you can just, uh, if you could just reach back, uh, come back to us with a response on the repaving of Paris street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7169.54s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7170.841s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7172.064s">Council</a>  President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7173.446s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7174.186s">Mr.</a>  President, I know this is a topic of yours with the thermoplastic painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7180.894s">During</a>  this year's MMA show, I went there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7184.298s">I</a>  had an opportunity to meet with the company that does the, that sells the thermoplastic painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7189.74s">And</a>  I met with some other city officials who have done the thermoplastic painting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7196.103s">Not</a>  on all the lines or anything, but they have at least done the crosswalks at different schools in different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7203.066s">And</a>  they said that the thermoplastic lasts five to six years, and it's been a win for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7210.869s">And</a>  I'd like to see us do that again this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7214.37s">I</a>  know you've championed this for many years, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7216.898s">But</a>  again, I think it's something that it should be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7219.48s">The</a>  company even said they would come down here and do one for free to show us how it would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7223.963s">And</a>  I think we should take them up on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7226.205s">And</a>  I say at least to do the crosswalks, the schools, and different things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7229.728s">You</a>  don't have to do the whole city with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7232.67s">And</a>  I would like to amend that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7237.453s">As</a>  amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7238.55s">On</a>  the motion, if I just could add, Council President Caraviello is absolutely correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7243.033s">The</a>  thermoplastic crosswalks are highly reflective, they're slip resistant, they have a life expectancy of four to five years, and they're cost effective in the long run.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7254.342s">Bill</a>  O'Regan said six years, they've gotten out of this.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7256.323s">Six</a>  years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7257.644s">The</a>  state uses them for the state highway and many of their projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7261.447s">So</a>  it's a very effective and efficient way of laying down a painted crosswalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7267.531s">without</a>  the upkeep year to year of repainting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7270.173s">So</a>  on the motion by Councilor Dello Russo for approval as amended by Councilor Scott Peli, as further amended by Councilor President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7281.221s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7282.262s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7282.642s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7283.563s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7284.744s">The</a>  motion is adopted.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7285.724s">Thank</a>  you Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7294.167s">17-304,</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request an opinion as to if we can vote to change our zoning one section or even one street at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7307.718s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7309.479s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7312.121s">This</a>  is something that a number of residents and I have been discussing along with, I believe, a few other prior councilors <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7322.016s">something</a>  that this council is beginning to discuss and have meetings on in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7329.022s">After</a>  doing some research with regards to how Seminole is handling their zoning changes, I read a few articles on it, and it sounds like they started their process about two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7341.571s">And</a>  the last I read sometime this fall, they were still working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7347.145s">They're</a>  actively working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7348.526s">They've</a>  had community meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7350.148s">They've</a>  had subcommittee meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7351.989s">They've</a>  created a committee to review their zoning in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7356.053s">It</a>  seems like they're doing it extensively. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7359.416s">Obviously,</a>  it's been brought up before that we should reach out to, I forget the gentleman's name, but reach out to the person from Somerville who is overseeing this project and get some ideas on how we can do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7374.51s">But</a>  in the meantime, we have a situation where a number of huge developments have gone up, a number of highly dense residential dwellings have gone up, whether it be Luminaire, we have one coming up on Middlesex Ave, and obviously a couple of controversial properties that have come down the line and have created controversy, I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7396.145s">And</a>  it seems like the public and the public that have been reaching out to me and that I've been reading <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7404.368s">discussing</a>  these issues are interested in developing, they're interested in not seeing empty storefronts. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7412.375s">Our</a>  residents are interested in redeveloping to a point where it's beneficial for the city and beneficial, how I should say it, beneficial for the neighborhood in a way that complements the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7426.007s">And</a>  what we're seeing with regards to, especially in the past, the number of variances that have been allowed <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7432.58s">We're</a>  seeing a need for zoning change in this community, and we're seeing it, we're in need of it far prior to how long it would take this city council to review it in its entirety. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7445.386s">So</a>  my question, and I haven't reviewed any acts, and I know Councilor Knight just mentioned an act, so he can bring that up, but I'm looking for an opinion, whether that be from our city solicitor or reaching out to Somerville, some way to find out if we, as a city council, can review <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7462.719s">whether</a>  it be a section of the city at a time, a street at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7467.362s">We</a>  know of developers who are very interested in developing in certain areas, and we want to make sure that we protect our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7474.585s">And</a>  you've seen that at the last few zoning meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7478.428s">The</a>  public have been forced to have to come to the table and bring their concerns and questions and downright just opposition to certain projects, which is unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7492.72s">You</a>  know, it does, whether or not zoning is going to be the solve-all, I don't think so, because we do still have the process of variances. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7500.501s">But</a>  with the new board and with proper zoning changes, I think we can make this a better process, and I think we can protect our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7508.283s">So</a>  my question to our city solicitor would be, can we do this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7511.883s">Can</a>  we sit down as a committee of the whole and discuss, I think, the latest project, Salem Street, for example? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7518.764s">Somebody</a>  else has mentioned Fountain Street is zoned apartment one. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7523.214s">Can</a>  we take an individual section of our city and say, okay, what is zone where and this is the problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7530.661s">And</a>  then call that street or section in for a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7534.565s">I</a>  mean, ask the public to weigh in on what do you want to see in your residential neighborhood or your business districts that are right outside your residential neighborhood? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7545.221s">seems</a>  like the administration is pushing for housing, housing, housing everywhere, which is not great for our infrastructure, our schools, our traffic, our parking problems that we have on so many different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7557.303s">And</a>  what I'm hearing from the people is we don't want to turn into Somerville, Cambridge, or Boston, these chairlifts we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7563.685s">We</a>  don't want to turn into Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7565.045s">We</a>  have more single-family districts or single-double-family districts in Medford than Cambridge and Somerville have, and people do not want <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7574.685s">to</a>  see us turn into Boston, and nor do I. Our schools can't handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7579.646s">Our</a>  streets, sidewalks, infrastructure, parking, traffic cannot handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7584.267s">And</a>  I think zoning is something that we need to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7587.387s">Obviously,</a>  I have a long-term plan, but we need to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7591.108s">If</a>  we can do it in a quicker fashion, I think we need to at least explore that option. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7596.849s">And</a>  this is one way that I think it could be possible, and I'm hoping that we get a positive result from it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7603.433s">And</a>  we can take those sections of our city that are plugged hotspots for developers and really figure out what's best for our neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7613.38s">Councilor</a>  Knife. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7614.581s">Mr.</a>  President, I wholeheartedly support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7616.862s">I</a>  feel as though getting an opinion from the solicitor is a great start for this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7621.045s">I</a>  also think it's very important for the council as we move forward to consider the impact that zoning has on our tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7628.803s">Because</a>  we have a bifurcated tax rate, we have the ability to equitably shift the residential property tax burden from the residential properties to the industrial and commercially zoned properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7641.491s">And</a>  now we're seeing a lot of use variances where they're going to try and eliminate these commercial and industrial properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7646.854s">And</a>  it's very important that we maintain a good stock of commercial and industrial properties so that we do have the ability to provide residential property tax relief, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7655.9s">So,</a>  moving forward, I think that's a very important aspect. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7659.056s">of</a>  zoning here in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7660.997s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Kerr was absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7663.019s">You</a>  know, when we go back and we think five, six, and seven years ago when the website, the real estate website Reddit found Medford, the first thing that they said was unbelievable tracks of open space and natural resources and a large stock of single family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7676.271s">And</a>  as we begin to develop and grow here in Medford, we're moving away from our large stock of single family homes and we're moving into high density apartments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7684.3s">And</a>  in some areas of the city, that's OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7686.521s">And</a>  in some places, that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7687.761s">And</a>  the mixed-use growth, I think, is an excellent opportunity for us to pursue an equitable shift between the commercial, industrial, and residential tax properties and the burdens that are provided to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7696.865s">But</a>  going forward, there are a number of issues that we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7698.946s">And</a>  I think that one of them would be maintaining a good balance of commercial and industrial zone properties, as well as increasing our stock of affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7707.409s">Because</a>  as our real estate market begins to thrive, the people that have lived in this community for so long and made Medford such a great place to live are being displaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7714.272s">and</a>  they have no place to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7715.372s">So</a>  they're actually getting forced out of Medford because they can no longer afford to live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7718.954s">And</a>  our stock of affordable housing is so low at this point in time, Mr. President, there's really no other option for them but to leave the community that they helped make great. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7725.556s">So</a>  I want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this matter forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7728.918s">I</a>  support it wholeheartedly, and I would anxiously await the solicitor's opinion.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7732.979s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7733.88s">Good</a>  motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7734.34s">You</a>  both are 100% correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7736.661s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as seconded by Councilor Knight, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7742.625s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7743.666s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7745.889s">And</a>  I'm pretty happy to see that this is coming up, because I've spoken here countless times about that we need to follow zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7754.4s">But</a>  the second part of that is that we also need to look at the zoning that we currently have and see if that zoning is working for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7761.112s">I</a>  pulled out a zoning map of Medford today and I looked around my neighborhood and I saw that all of Salem Street and pretty much every street from Fulton Street to 93 was zoned apartment 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7773.138s">And</a>  as I drove here and took 10 minutes to drive from Park Street to City Hall, which is pretty crazy because it's four blocks, all the traffic, I thought, can we really handle that many apartment buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7785.385s">on</a>  Salem Street in that area with traffic, with the school that's the largest elementary school in the city, and overcrowded? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7794.211s">No,</a>  we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7794.952s">So</a>  we really need to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7796.653s">I</a>  know that there is calls for hiring consultants, but that can take a lot of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7801.216s">Anyone</a>  who attended the zoning meeting on the Salem Street project said, well, you know, one apartment building isn't going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7807.24s">But</a>  they did have a stack of support letters from people that owned property on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7813.845s">that</a>  would probably be the next buildings that come up and want to add apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7818.086s">So</a>  that could be six more buildings in the next year or two, 10 more buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7822.008s">Then</a>  we'd swing around down Fountain Street and add another 10 or 15 or 20 buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7826.209s">And</a>  we would cripple that entire side of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7828.69s">We</a>  would change the dynamic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7831.271s">My</a>  parents have lived in that neighborhood for more than 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7834.172s">It's</a>  a heavy owner-occupied neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7836.553s">I</a>  live on another side that's also heavily owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7840.774s">More</a>  than 80% of Medford is owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7843.904s">Shifting</a>  to more buildings where people are not coming out and talking to their neighbors is really not what Medford is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7851.133s">And</a>  we really need to be cognizant of whether our quality of life is more important than just adding more buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7857.7s">Because</a>  when you add more buildings, they don't just drop tax money off at the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7861.565s">They</a>  come with infrastructure needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7863.167s">They</a>  come with costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7864.735s">And</a>  do those costs exceed the tax money that we get? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7868.418s">Because</a>  I know it looks great when it said, look, we got this much more tax money this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7872.241s">But</a>  we really have to factor in our infrastructure costs as we see that we're short police and we're short fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7878.686s">And</a>  I don't believe that these additional tax revenues that we're getting from the Lumiere's or the, I don't even want to say, but the Locust Street that hopefully will never happen, will not exceed the costs that they will add to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7891.916s">They'll</a>  diminish our quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7894.3s">And</a>  we really need to think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7896.201s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7896.741s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7900.363s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7901.664s">David</a>  McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7905.145s">Point</a>  to Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7909.107s">Being</a>  able to balance zoning is an incredibly important thing for a city to do because of the actual tax base. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7918.311s">And</a>  having to be able to, or actually just being able to, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7921.883s">increase</a>  the commercial tax base so you can actually either balance or decrease the residential tax base is an amazing prospect for the residents of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7933.112s">And</a>  I think any resident in Medford would be more than happy to accept that kind of a balance or that shift in being able to kind of offset the burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7943.461s">Secondly,</a>  being an old retailer, there is a major, major shift <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7949.133s">for</a>  shoppers to get out of the malls and get into neighborhoods, back into neighborhoods, back into what they call fabricated cities as you see in Somerville and in Wellington and up in, there's so many different places. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7965.139s">So</a>  you really have to look at what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7968.141s">We</a>  have such great opportunity downtown and maybe reworking some of these zones to actually structure <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7973.963s">a</a>  future for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7975.467s">This</a>  would be an excellent downtown for something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=7981.042s">to</a>  be able to take advantage of the .75 tax, sales tax that you could take advantage of with additional restaurants and the hotel tax with the new hotel that's coming, you're really gonna position yourself to be able to go back to what we said earlier, which is plan for much bigger projects and better ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8000.451s">But</a>  you have to have the vision to understand that and you have to kind of try to fight your way towards that because I'll tell you, you've got a waterway, most cities don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8009.483s">You've</a>  got such a proximity to Boston that most cities don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8013.808s">You've</a>  got so many things working for us and in our favor that if we don't look at this and don't look at the rezoning, it's a missed opportunity for everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8024.381s">And</a>  I'm telling you right now, that's the opportunity to gain. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8027.124s">That's</a>  the opportunity to look at, because that is where most people are gravitating towards when it comes to shopping. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8034.029s">And</a>  they want that lifestyle. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8035.39s">They</a>  want that hometown feel again. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8037.811s">And</a>  I'm lucky enough to do business in a city like that, and that city does get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8042.975s">And</a>  I can tell you the residents of that city, their tax burden year after year after year is constantly offset by people like myself and some other friends that do business in that city as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8053.642s">And</a>  it's a great, great thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8055.022s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8063.266s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8063.726s">Jean</a>  Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8066.448s">I</a>  think it's no secret that I am extremely passionate about both Medford and its development. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8075.772s">I</a>  am totally heartened to see this come before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8081.154s">I</a>  think it is one of the most critical <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8083.587s">responsibilities</a>  that the City Council holds. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8087.089s">Residents</a>  of this city make a social contract when we purchase here that where we purchase will stay similar, not the same, but similar to where we buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8099.297s">And</a>  I think that we are in some ways under attack from developers around us that are starting to come in and cannibalize us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8109.143s">I'm</a>  concerned <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8110.598s">for</a>  people who've made the decision to age in place here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8115.579s">We</a>  historically have people come and stay for generations and that is with thought, not by accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8123.781s">And</a>  I feel that if we're not careful, those families are going to be pushed out and Medford will be gentrified just as Somerville has been gentrified and Cambridge before it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8135.208s">I</a>  think Medford is in an enviable position. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8138.311s">When</a>  you look at the surrounding cities, they don't have the green spaces that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8142.556s">When</a>  you look at their green maps, their teeny dots across the city, little islands, Medford has whole areas where we don't have development. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8153.007s">And</a>  I think we have an opportunity to be very purposeful about what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8158.169s">I</a>  always liken Medford to a diamond in the rough, because I do believe that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8164.072s">If</a>  you know a jeweler, they won't cleave a diamond until they're sure of what they're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8169.054s">And</a>  Medford has areas that are ripe for development, but it should be development that we deem necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8176.957s">And</a>  so I would encourage <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8179.161s">this</a>  council to continue to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8182.282s">And</a>  I would put forth for your consideration that we have a great deal of subject matter expertise within our city limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8190.124s">There</a>  are many people who are very passionate about this specific topic and have good visions. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8195.445s">I've</a>  talked with some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8197.186s">I've</a>  heard of some of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8198.686s">And</a>  I think that we have committees for Walk Medford, Bike Medford, the arts, but we do not have a citizen representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8209.205s">for</a>  development, which is the critical thing for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8213.686s">And</a>  I really think that that's one thing that's lacking because a good and meaningful committee or coalition of Medford residents with some subject matter expertise can help you in that, you know, and bring to bear. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8227.328s">It's</a>  a big undertaking, but I'm glad to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8230.589s">And</a>  again, I would stress that in my mind and in my opinion, it is one of the most crucial things <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8238.088s">the</a>  crucial contracts that you have between your constituents, that you're going to, you know, look to protect the interest of the Medford residents, recognizing that developers coming in are buying and they're property owners, but they're not the same type of property owners that are going to be here and stay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8255.131s">They're</a>  going to turn the property around and make their profit and usually leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8260.072s">So,</a>  I'm very encouraged to see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8261.832s">I</a>  appreciate the positive thoughts and I hope that we continue in this forward movement.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8276.479s">Thank</a>  you, Council President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8278.401s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8279.502s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8283.485s">Good</a>  development, I believe, most of the time is very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8288.268s">It's</a>  just that, how was this now? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8291.611s">How</a>  was I going to present this? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8295.433s">especially</a>  if it's mixed use, a la station landing, because that's how the Roman Empire did business way back. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8303.016s">If</a>  you lived here, if you worked here, you could eat downstairs, you didn't even need a bicycle, for God's sakes, in the T's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8312.4s">It'd</a>  be nice to have one in Method Square someday also. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8315.681s">Might</a>  as well get that in there again. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8318.823s">Council</a>  President, however, when the new growth <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8325.687s">That's</a>  the new real estate taxes from these brand new developments that grow out of ground are not applied to offset the prop two and a half increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8339.274s">This</a>  new growth doesn't help the taxpayer at all that pays real estate taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8346.378s">It</a>  hurts us because we have to get more schools, more teachers, more police, more fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8356.577s">infrastructure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8359.299s">So</a>  I don't see how it helps us. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8362.382s">As</a>  a matter of fact, it hurts us because the following year to the $100 million tax levy, they add the new growth, the 1.7 million, and then the two, prop two and a half, another two and a half million on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8376.272s">Then</a>  they take two and a half percent of that greater number. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8379.575s">Again,</a>  it's like the Russian lady used to say here 15, 20 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8383.396s">It's</a>  like an annuity that keeps on giving, but at the cost of the real estate taxpayers here. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8394.818s">I'd</a>  like to see the city to be a hopping place, because the location is strategic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8399.398s">It's</a>  probably the best in all of Massachusetts, proximity to Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8403.839s">There's</a>  a lot of open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8404.919s">We're</a>  being jammed in in East Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8410.051s">I'm</a>  not sure, maybe we should secede from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8415.312s">It's</a>  a capital idea, possibly. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8416.872s">Councilor</a>  Marks, you lived it yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8419.773s">West</a>  Medford can stay with Winchester, with your own zip code, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8425.194s">Well,</a>  that's okay, because who's gonna pay for their services, the squeaky wheels? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8429.095s">The</a>  salt won't be able to pay anymore if West Medford secedes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8432.216s">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8433.276s">You</a>  get all the money, but we have the territory. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8438.266s">From</a>  Route 93 all the way to Fells Lake, this is like Donald Trump land, very valuable. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8445.311s">If</a>  you ever have one of the two fires Chelsea ever had, hang on to your land. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8450.335s">I</a>  like new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8452.416s">But</a>  if you don't use the real estate taxes, and by the way, who says you have to raise real estate taxes $1 or actually $2.5 million at 2.5% of last year's $100 million levy? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8468.595s">Is</a>  there a law that says you have to? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8471.558s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Briana. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8473.68s">I</a>  knew I liked you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8475.101s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8476.582s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8477.002s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8478.063s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8479.124s">And</a>  I thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8483.588s">I</a>  fully support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8485.25s">I</a>  have been pretty vocal about zoning since I've been on this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8491.055s">And</a>  I made a resolution a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8494.308s">The</a>  resolution is still in subcommittee, but I still firmly believe that we need to hire someone from the outside to come in and look at zoning in every neighborhood throughout this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8507.264s">I</a>  understand going street by street, but every neighborhood needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8513.028s">It</a>  probably is the most important responsibility that we have, zoning as a board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8518.592s">That</a>  is one of our most important responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8521.053s">This</a>  needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8522.074s">It</a>  needs to be looked at sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8524.155s">I</a>  firmly believe that we need to bring in someone from the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8527.317s">I'll</a>  say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8528.138s">There's</a>  no one behind this reel that is qualified to look at zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8533.521s">I</a>  think we need an expert opinion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8535.022s">You</a>  talk about balanced zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8537.043s">You</a>  talk about different neighborhoods, residential versus commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8542.851s">the</a>  changes that are made, or the lack of changes that are made, really affect and impact the fabric of each neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8549.156s">So</a>  I want to just go on record, I do support this, but I also do think that we need to meet to address this and to bring in someone from the outside to look at this even further. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8558.182s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8559.183s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8561.204s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8562.785s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8564.446s">I,</a>  too, have <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8567.289s">have</a>  pushed for different avenues to oversee and review our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8572.213s">And</a>  I'll say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8573.354s">I</a>  think the mayor mentioned it at her State of the City and reaching out to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and getting their immediate sit down and set a plan with the city and the stakeholders to make sure that we could do what's right for our community and our vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8592.808s">As</a>  Mr. McKillop said, Medford is the jewel. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8595.89s">It's</a>  our term. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8597.037s">You</a>  know, we have the Chevalier, we have the Mystic, we have the Fells, 93, Mystic Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8603.689s">There's</a>  so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8607.412s">There's</a>  so much to plan in those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8609.532s">So</a>  again, if we can put an amendment, I appreciate Councilor Long and Kern for putting this in, but reaching out to the mayor and asking them, reaching out again to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council to set a plan in reviewing how we need to even start our process in zoning because things are happening so fast, it's going too fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8632.677s">And</a>  we need to slow it down so we can all share our vision and what we think Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8637.971s">should</a>  be and will be in years to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8640.132s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8732.41s">I</a>  did not say, I get the mayor's opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8734.991s">I</a>  said the mayor mentioned at a State of the City that we would reach out to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council to get them involved, to start dialogue, to get us moving for zoning in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8744.974s">That's</a>  what I said.</p>

do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8796.086s">Because</a>  there's already going to be six, 10 buildings already approved and ready to go, because it's apartment zoned. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8802.412s">And</a>  all they have to do is say, we'll do three stories, and they're good to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8805.636s">Because</a>  that's what the zoning says. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8807.217s">This</a>  is an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8808.759s">This</a>  needs to happen now. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8810.34s">The</a>  Roberts Elementary School currently has 569 children. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8813.701s">And</a>  just to put that into perspective, more than 100 of those students are ELL students that require extra services. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8819.804s">So</a>  while the schools are built to hold 600 students, they are not built to hold 600 students where 100 of them need extra services in this and 50 of them need extra services in that, because those are extra spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8831.568s">So</a>  this is extremely important to me as I have a third grader in that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8836.99s">and</a>  the largest third grade in the entire city at five classes and more than 100 students, just in the third grade, not including the ELL, not including the inclusion classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8846.695s">So</a>  this is very important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8849.416s">This</a>  is very personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8852.386s">but</a>  just to get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8854.207s">So</a>  I think that we really need to consider this before we think about waiting for a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8858.389s">This</a>  is one of the most important things that the city council's in charge of is zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8862.191s">And</a>  when zoning is going well, zoning is virtually invisible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8864.912s">For</a>  years, the zoning in Medford was virtually invisible. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8868.174s">A</a>  lot of people went in and they got their decks and they added their extra parking spaces, but all of a sudden, some developers noticed a hole and they came in and they're trying to fill us in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8878.459s">And</a>  so now we're paying attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8883.35s">So</a>  we need to look realistically at what these neighborhoods can handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8886.991s">When</a>  we saw the traffic loads at the meeting that I attended for Salem Street, they recorded more than 1,000 cars per hour going down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8894.854s">Think</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8895.494s">That's</a>  a lot of cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8897.955s">A</a>  lot of times that traffic is backed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8900.415s">I</a>  tried to get to Haines Square over the weekend and the traffic was backed up almost to the Rotary at 93 on just a random Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8909.463s">The</a>  zoning there calls for apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8911.444s">Those</a>  apartment buildings can be three stories high and probably between 12 to 15 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8917.549s">Imagine</a>  them on every plot on Salem Street and the street would just be closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8922.672s">The</a>  neighborhood would be decimated. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8925.114s">That</a>  is what the zoning intends for that area as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8928.916s">And</a>  that may have been true when they created that zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8932.659s">It's</a>  no longer true. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8934.36s">It's</a>  emergent that this council act to change that zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8939.133s">to</a>  a more appropriate scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8942.135s">What</a>  that scenario is, I can't say, but I can say that it's not apartments up and down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8947.94s">We</a>  also need to consider the load of those additional residents on our infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8953.344s">Our</a>  police and our fire are understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8956.246s">Our</a>  DPW is understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8961.934s">So</a>  we really need to consider the quality of life also of people that are living in those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8966.497s">What</a>  are their expectations when they moved in? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8968.819s">Because</a>  if you look at Salem Street, most of those buildings are one story. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8973.302s">There</a>  are some two family houses mixed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8976.624s">There's</a>  a couple of apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8979.206s">More</a>  of them are closer to 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8981.467s">These</a>  are not areas that we think of as high concentrated residences. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8988.658s">basically</a>  trying to overcrowd this side of the city if we now target this street to suddenly enact the apartment one zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=8996.084s">We</a>  need to consider, when we keep the zoning, if our infrastructure needs can meet the expanding population that this zoning allows. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9006.492s">I</a>  would say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9008.533s">We</a>  can't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9010.234s">We're</a>  not gonna suddenly be able to add one, five, 10% to our population and <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9018.645s">be</a>  able to have enough police and fire to support that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9020.746s">We</a>  know that it takes several months to train police and fire, but it also takes tax dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9027.189s">While</a>  we heard that these new buildings will bring 100,000, or I think Locust Street said they were going to bring a million dollars in new tax revenue, 490 families would bring in an incredible amount of additional needs on the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9043.328s">even</a>  if they just had a small 10% children, that's almost 50 children added to the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9049.271s">Can</a>  our school system handle that burden? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9051.271s">Can</a>  our budget handle the additional costs of those students? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9055.433s">So</a>  I urge you to immediately look at all the streets that are zoned apartment one. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9059.815s">Salem</a>  Street's not the only street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9061.396s">Fountain</a>  Street's not the only street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9063.297s">I'm</a>  sure there are pockets in other parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9066.318s">My</a>  map is pretty hard to read out the street names, so I could only pick out the ones that I recognize. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9073.755s">This</a>  is coming and this isn't just something that is going to maybe happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9078.859s">This</a>  is something that is actively happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9081.841s">People</a>  are watching to see if this project at the old break pro is going to be approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9087.065s">And</a>  while it's great to see something different there as opposed to an abandoned building, we have to consider if the street can handle the load of buildings up and down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9097.652s">So</a>  I hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9100.478s">you</a>  will take this seriously and responsibly try to change this zoning as quickly as possible before it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9108.4s">Because</a>  once those buildings are constructed and sitting on those sites, once those children are going up to the high school to enroll in our schools, it's too late. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9118.303s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9131.112s">G.</a>  Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street, right around the corner from Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9134.715s">This</a>  is my neighborhood, so I feel doubly strongly about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9139.558s">Again,</a>  as far as I can tell from all of the readings and all of my interactions in various cities that are structured similarly, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9149.679s">Zoning</a>  starts with the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9152.16s">With</a>  all respect, I'm disinterested in what the mayor's opinion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9156.242s">I'm</a>  disinterested in what the community development's opinion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9159.664s">And</a>  I'm disinterested at some level of what the ZBA's opinion is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9162.905s">This</a>  is the neighborhood that we live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9165.826s">We</a>  are the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9167.267s">We</a>  are the people who will drive by it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9169.708s">We</a>  are the people who will sit in the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9172.109s">We</a>  are the people that as these buildings go up will deal with the power outages. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9175.951s">We</a>  just had one not a week ago on Tuesday that was for hours for some people. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9182.635s">It's</a>  getting into the shower and not getting proper water supply because we're already getting developed more than we need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9189.818s">It's</a>  sewer systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9191.599s">It's</a>  backing up the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9193.12s">It's</a>  the fact that when you drive down the streets in our neighborhood, people are cutting through because they're trying to avoid <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9199.823s">93,</a>  and with the fast 14, the entire state has learned how to cut through the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9205.648s">So</a>  I mean, I think that we can't handle the additional volume that we're hearing someone somewhere is envisioning in this neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9215.936s">I</a>  mean, it looks like Beirut. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9217.538s">It</a>  looks like they test missiles around there. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9219.84s">The</a>  potholes are so big it'll eat a Subaru. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9222.502s">So</a>  I get that it's considered somewhat <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9225.907s">blighted,</a>  although I take exception to that term because it's blighted because it hasn't been cared for properly in budgeting, budgetary planning. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9235.389s">So</a>  I don't think that, you know, having a vision of putting 15, 20 of these down Stalem Street is really going to do anybody any favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9246.732s">I</a>  think we're going to get into a situation where the people who live in the neighborhood, their properties are going to be devalued because they're not going to be these new buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9256.616s">We're</a>  going to be dwarfed by these big buildings coming down Salem Street, and we're going to be gentrified out. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9262.698s">People</a>  who have been in those neighborhoods for two and three generations. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9266.439s">families</a>  that are young and have bought in because they like the neighborhood and they like the small feel of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9272.453s">So</a>  respectfully, I understand that there are different groups that <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9277.551s">have</a>  political, optical interests at play, but when it comes nine o'clock at night, they don't put their head on the pillow, you know, in the various areas of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9287.933s">It's</a>  just where they live, and I don't see any big circles being drawn around where their houses are. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9293.514s">So</a>  I would ask that you make this a top priority, because they are lining up. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9299.835s">There</a>  is a scuttlebutt. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9301.596s">We're</a>  starting to see some construction happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9304.296s">We</a>  started to see a few people apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9306.997s">Some,</a>  it looks like, are going to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9308.757s">Some</a>  looks like they may not. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9310.158s">I'm</a>  not sure what the rhyme or reason will be, but it would be very unfortunate to see an area that has some beautiful buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9318.38s">Some</a>  of the buildings in our neighborhood are quite lovely. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9320.961s">you</a>  know, be taken away and have it turn out to look like Main Street in Cambridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9326.345s">Not</a>  that there's anything wrong with Main Street in Cambridge, but that was Cambridge's decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9330.147s">I</a>  don't want it to be a developer's decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9332.249s">So</a>  I know it's a little bit strong, my commentary, but I feel like our neighbourhood is really on the chopping block very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9343.413s">And</a>  it will go like dominoes if we don't do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9346.676s">So</a>  I would urge you to please consider it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9349.858s">Because</a>  for those of us who live there, it's heartbreaking for us to consider that it might not be there anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9355.022s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9357.024s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9360.587s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Knight to receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9363.909s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Lungo-Koehn to revert back to regular business. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9367.632s">17305,</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9372.693s">Be</a>  it resolved that the sewer connection fees that are charged by the City of Medford, per lateral, be updated and charged per fixture as our fees have not been updated since 2013 and are due for reassessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9387.385s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9388.906s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9390.887s">This</a>  is a resolution I had on maybe two months ago with regards to connection fees, requesting an update from our city engineer, and she thankfully <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9401.08s">I</a>  thank her for giving us an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9403.161s">She</a>  did mention that they are due for a reassessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9405.643s">So</a>  I ask that we look into, rather than a per lateral fee, we look into a charging per fixture. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9412.968s">I</a>  believe our fee amounts are outdated by probably several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9418.172s">And</a>  if we look at other cities and towns, they're doing it much differently and capturing more revenue than the city of Medford is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9423.816s">This</a>  is just one area that was brought to my attention that I've been looking into. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9427.899s">And</a>  I think it's a good resolve. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9430.243s">can</a>  definitely be a start to updating what we need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9434.486s">I</a>  ask for a roll call vote.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9436.407s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Kern, seconded by Councilor Marks, roll call vote has been requested.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9445.974s">Vice</a>  President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9447.676s">Just</a>  so I understand, this is a connection fee for new construction you're talking? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9452.139s">Only</a>  new construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9453.039s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9460.261s">I</a>  believe a sewer connection fee is for new construction, yes.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9463.842s">Right,</a>  because as part of that paper you offered two months ago, we also asked if the, as a separate, I think it was a paper A or B, that if the water and sewer commissioners were looking at a sewer connection for existing homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9479.745s">And</a>  we never really got an answer on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9481.966s">We</a>  got an answer that there is a sewer connection for new construction.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9487.584s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, we can specify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9489.604s">This</a>  can be for new construction and maybe get an update with regards to any other, if a reassessment is looked at by our city engineer, that we get an update with regards to any other updates or, you know, any other updates or different assessments that she thinks are necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9508.989s">This</a>  is just one that I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9510.789s">I</a>  read the city of Cambridge's ordinance and it's very different than ours and they're capturing a new construction <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9518.553s">much</a>  more that could go towards our infrastructure needs, especially in those areas that are being developed.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9525.677s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9526.758s">So</a>  we amend the paper to say new construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9528.498s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9534.502s">Um,</a>  yes, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9535.522s">I</a>  was wondering if the sponsor of the resolution could explain, um, how more revenue was captured by changing the current situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9546.975s">and</a>  whether or not she spoke with anybody from the Water and Sewer Commission as to whether or not we would be able to actually capture more revenue or whether or not it would be a zero-sum game. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9555.737s">I</a>  know these are probably questions that you can't answer offhand, but something that raises a concern because I don't want to see raising fees and costing additional funds to individuals trying to develop certain properties if, in fact, we're not going to see a return on the other end, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9571.806s">But</a>  for the purposes of the resolution, I don't feel comfortable dictating to the Water and Sewer Commission what approach they should take. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9579.532s">I'd</a>  feel better having them present to us what our options are and then us making a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9586.096s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9589.038s">I</a>  think what we do as a city council is make recommendations anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9592.32s">This</a>  is a recommendation that this type of fee be added. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9595.742s">I</a>  did speak to somebody in the City of Cambridge Engineering Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9600.36s">Who</a>  did say by charging the per fixture, you do capture much more revenue because it's obviously per fixture versus whatever the per lateral is. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9611.002s">I</a>  believe it was just one set fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9614.062s">I</a>  think it's $100, the city of Medford charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9616.403s">And</a>  it sounded to me like it was per project. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9618.883s">So</a>  per fixture fee, obviously, if you have a larger project, you have many more fixtures, which you could capture. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9624.984s">And</a>  obviously, we have so much need to update our <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9629.205s">infrastructure,</a>  water and sewer, especially, that I believe this money could go to, obviously, to help with that.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9636.387s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9636.727s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9639.067s">Robert</a>  Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this board. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9643.388s">I</a>  understand the resolution is adopted, but the question I would have is that why would you want to charge somebody <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9652.583s">a</a>  connection fee, because right now you pay from your house to the middle of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9657.226s">So</a>  now you're saying that you connect to the city's lines for water and sewer, for which the city charges you for inflow and outflow of the water going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9665.891s">We</a>  have over $8.5 million in a surplus account that they can't figure out how and where it should be spent as it relates to infrastructure and water-sewer lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9675.4s">Now,</a>  if you want to talk about doing that for a commercial piece of property, that's one thing, because they're digging up the street, and there's a linkage fee that's attached to it as it relates to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9683.983s">But</a>  on single-family homes, two-family homes, or whatever it might be, you're already charging the homeowners, already paying for that hookup from the middle of the street to the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9694.127s">So</a>  I think what you need is probably a further clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9698.419s">as</a>  it relates to where it's going on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9700.04s">And</a>  I think this begs the question, where are you going with your $8.5 million in the surplus account? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9705.044s">Where's</a>  the infrastructure? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9705.985s">Where's</a>  the LNI that's taking place in the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9708.927s">Where</a>  are the projects that have been sitting there that need to be addressed? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9712.41s">Before</a>  you start charging another fee, possibly, to the taxpayer in this community, I mean, you've got a CPA tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9719.494s">that</a>  the state isn't even going to give you a dime back, because they have no money to give it back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9723.656s">So</a>  you're technically putting another tax on the Medford resident taxpayer in this community, and they're getting nothing back for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9730.139s">But</a>  you are charging them, and you don't even have a program set aside for what it's going to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9735.381s">You've</a>  got almost $8.5 million in water and sewer. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9737.582s">You've</a>  got close to $9 million in your free cash account. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9741.304s">And</a>  then you're talking about building all these new buildings that need to be built, that nothing can take place until after 2022, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9748.823s">going</a>  into 2023 to free up the bonds. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9751.465s">So</a>  what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9752.166s">Start</a>  taking from your free cash? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9754.088s">Or</a>  are you going to do an override of two and a half with the taxpayers? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9757.29s">Or</a>  are you going to start laying off people? <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9759.652s">You</a>  just spent $14.4 million to build a new Department of Public Works building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9764.176s">You</a>  don't have enough men to do it, to work it on a daily basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9770.856s">The</a>  problem that I see, and it's just my opinion, that you folks have got no relationship with this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9777.579s">You</a>  absolutely have nothing to do with her on anything in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9782.261s">She</a>  just uses you for whatever she wants, when she wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9786.862s">Listen,</a>  if this is going to be cohesive and a working relationship, you people need to put your foot down. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9791.484s">It</a>  only takes four of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9793.145s">Four</a>  of you have enough intestinal fortitude to tell the city administration enough is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9799.802s">Because</a>  I'll tell you right now, you folks keep going in this direction, your election this November is going to have a different audience out there and behind this rail, because people are fed up with the fact that they're paying for something, they're not getting it, there's no cooperation, there's no fluidness, there's no transparency, and there's no honesty coming out of this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9819.532s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=9820.032s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[l7j4K8jolL8_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10353.807s">Thank</a>  you, Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10356.269s">If</a>  the mayor listens to me on this, she's going to get a lot of hard phone calls and some emails. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10364.897s">Unfortunately,</a>  she has started a bad precedent for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10368.132s">While</a>  I appreciate the intent of public awareness of certain city-sponsored events, posting them on City Hall's outside wall is an inappropriate place to display such information. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10379.639s">City</a>  Hall is the seat of our government, not a billboard for city-wide information. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10385.022s">I</a>  find it cheapens the city in a few ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10388.104s">One,</a>  it unknowingly sets up favorite versus non-favorite groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10393.187s">While</a>  some are vocal, <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10394.902s">There</a>  may be other groups that feel intimidated to speak in opposition of the quote, favorite group, which has already attained preference in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10405.664s">This</a>  unseen bias can create unnecessary resentment. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10409.324s">It</a>  can pit one group against the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10412.105s">Eventually,</a>  we may have two groups who will oppose each other in concept, wanting to be represented on City Hall, i.e., pro-life versus pro-choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10421.527s">This</a>  is a dangerous practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10424.524s">It</a>  detracts from the visual image of the building itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10428.065s">Our</a>  City Hall was built in a time of magnificent architecture. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10431.867s">The</a>  banners detract from the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10433.507s">flag,</a>  which should be the only thing on a person's mind as they pass City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10438.469s">Yes,</a>  the MIA flag is there as well, for a reason that you should already also be thinking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10446.032s">Three,</a>  the banners are distracting to drivers. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10449.813s">Four,</a>  and most importantly, it detracts from the true purpose of City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10454.71s">to</a>  be the people's house, the building which holds the right of everyone to enter and express their views in the way that they would like to be governed. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10464.159s">We</a>  should revere this building as peoples all around the world would die to have a building such as this, where their voices could be heard, not to be an advertisement space. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10480.917s">I</a>  understand why the gay community wanted to see the rainbow flag up on City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10485.799s">It</a>  was simply for affirmation, which is an understandable goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10490.22s">So</a>  since I am asking the mayor not to put up the flag in June, I feel obligated to make at least three other suggestions to affirm the gay population in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10501.444s">They</a>  are as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10502.905s">We</a>  can interview people who are gay on a TV show through the new access station <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10509.058s">We</a>  can write a book on gays who live in Medford, and I would recommend Carl Seberg to top the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10515.443s">We</a>  can rent the Chevalier Theater and hold a celebration of gay life through a musical. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10520.266s">We</a>  can organize a pizza night for gays at a certain restaurant and invite straights who want to support them, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10527.611s">I</a>  hope that these other avenues will be received in the spirit that I offer them. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10531.955s">If</a>  the city would like to sponsor something, they could hold a night at the library in June <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10538.333s">where</a>  they have readings on gay material or have gay speakers. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10545.698s">These</a>  are actually more grassroots methods and require the gay community to advocate for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10550.781s">And</a>  seeing this, it will commit more people to participate in the rest of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10557.045s">And</a>  by example, they will lead and be better received. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10560.367s">In</a>  conclusion, I am therefore respectfully asking you to take down any and all ads for future events <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10567.168s">or</a>  community communications. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10570.769s">For</a>  they disrespect the purpose and solemnity in which this building deserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10575.229s">This</a>  is not to say that any of the causes are unworthy of respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10579.61s">This</a>  is just not the place for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/r-uaa_v8IPE&t=10581.39s">Thank</a>  you for considering my request.</p>
