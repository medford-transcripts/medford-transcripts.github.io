[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:26,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

[SPEAKER_07]: President Caraviello.

10
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:28,251
[SPEAKER_07]: Present.

11
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:30,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Please rise and salute the flag.

12
00:00:31,753 --> 00:00:42,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

13
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:44,882
Present.

14
00:00:45,942 --> 00:00:46,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dello Russo.

15
00:00:47,932 --> 00:00:49,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to suspend the rules to take paper off the table.

16
00:00:49,793 --> 00:00:54,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo to suspend the rules to take what paper, Mr. President?

17
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:57,197
[SPEAKER_07]: 17-075, third reading.

18
00:00:57,217 --> 00:01:04,662
[SPEAKER_07]: 17-075, which would be the third reading for the law and order for the Newton Police Station.

19
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:08,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the paper before us?

20
00:01:09,044 --> 00:01:10,205
[SPEAKER_07]: The paper is now before us.

21
00:01:10,885 --> 00:01:11,446
[SPEAKER_07]: Move approval.

22
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:16,268
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo for approval,

23
00:01:17,797 --> 00:01:18,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lungo-Kramer.

24
00:01:18,977 --> 00:01:21,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

25
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:41,905
[SPEAKER_14]: I know before we took the first reading on this paper, we had discussed, and I think it was voted six to one, to take the next three months, along with the administration, to review and discuss cost analysis with regards to a potential dual station and discuss a number of different things.

26
00:01:43,677 --> 00:01:46,420
[SPEAKER_14]: people's concerns with regards to the fire station.

27
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,725
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wanted to see if we were going to schedule a meeting with the mayor on that before we.

28
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,428
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor did not respond to our resolution that I know of.

29
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:57,891
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen it in any of my packages.

30
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:58,551
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't either.

31
00:01:59,092 --> 00:01:59,853
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen it.

32
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:04,797
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know what the council wants to do.

33
00:02:04,877 --> 00:02:09,382
[SPEAKER_14]: I just feel like that was a strong six to one vote with regards to

34
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:20,143
[SPEAKER_14]: looking into, and now I believe the fire station, I'm not sure, doesn't have any heat, and that's been going on, I think since the snowstorm, I was getting reports that there was no heat.

35
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:26,726
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think it's pretty pertinent to, for at least a discussion, even if it's next week, we have a discussion on that.

36
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:39,810
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't know if it's worth putting this off a week and seeing if we can get a response from the mayor's office on that resolution, but it was a strong six to one vote, and a number of people were in this audience in support of

37
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:51,701
[SPEAKER_14]: looking into a cost analysis and getting some numbers together, better than what we were provided, so we can really see if we can't afford the dual station and get a better idea.

38
00:02:51,721 --> 00:03:01,864
[SPEAKER_14]: I know a number of things were thrown around and certain contradictions were made a few weeks back, so I think some more clarity is in order.

39
00:03:01,884 --> 00:03:06,606
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how my colleagues feel.

40
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:09,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

41
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:10,423
[SPEAKER_07]: I second the motion for approval.

42
00:03:11,864 --> 00:03:13,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

43
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,910
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

44
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,592
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

45
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:26,094
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a former member of the Saugus Party.

46
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:35,020
[SPEAKER_17]: I can appreciate what Councilor Lungelkorn is going to because apparently, I think folks, as I was speaking to them today, were led to believe it was going to be next Tuesday evening.

47
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:41,869
[SPEAKER_17]: And here we are, we have nobody here from the fire department or the police department.

48
00:03:42,569 --> 00:04:00,553
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you go back and look at your capital improvement plan that was offered by the mayor, there's quite a few locations and suggestions in here that raised itself well over two and a half million dollars as to where and how this is going to be funded as it relates to the fire station and into the police station part of it.

49
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:04,894
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, a lot of people don't even realize what just took place on the 14th of March

50
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:12,968
[SPEAKER_17]: the day of the storm, the unfortunate circumstance down the fire department and the police department, their generator went out.

51
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:20,173
[SPEAKER_17]: Their backup generator to be supportive of their police operations, their telecommunications, their communications back and forth.

52
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:29,720
[SPEAKER_17]: From what I understand and I believe it to be true, one if not maybe two of the doors of the fire department couldn't even be open because they had no electricity.

53
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,883
[SPEAKER_17]: And their backup generator, which apparently wasn't serviced like it should have been serviced,

54
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:39,282
[SPEAKER_17]: was out for a couple of days and they had to wait for a pot, and that's all because of what took place with the storm.

55
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:42,544
[SPEAKER_17]: You really have a whole host of issues here.

56
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:47,348
[SPEAKER_17]: You talk about a $2 billion seismic study for that.

57
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:56,875
[SPEAKER_17]: None of you have gone through the reading of the over 690 pages of the $110,000 report that was written in January, submitted in January of 2013.

58
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:57,555
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going to be having here

59
00:05:01,613 --> 00:05:08,656
[SPEAKER_17]: a little later this evening, because I see the superintendent here, and you're going to be having a discussion on something that relates to the high school in multi-millions of dollars.

60
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,837
[SPEAKER_17]: And you really need to ask the same question.

61
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:14,258
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going to have a seismic erratic study for that piece of property up there, too.

62
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:17,659
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I think it's unfair to the Medford taxpayer.

63
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:20,620
[SPEAKER_17]: Just like you folks, I am a taxpayer here in the city.

64
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:23,041
[SPEAKER_17]: The building was built in 1962.

65
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:28,485
[SPEAKER_17]: Same thing with the high school, honor about in that same year of category.

66
00:05:29,026 --> 00:05:35,813
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're looking for a major, major overhaul, if not reconstruction or additions to whatever it might be.

67
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,496
[SPEAKER_17]: But the question really needs to be asked.

68
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,559
[SPEAKER_17]: It's obvious that maintenance has not taken place in these buildings.

69
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:52,414
[SPEAKER_17]: You, Councilor Caraviello, if you remember correctly, I think it was your first term, the beginning of your first term, you indicated that the all new schools at that point in time, which are 11 years old, was a million point one in arrears for fixtures.

70
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:57,417
[SPEAKER_17]: And now it's still well in excess of a million, if not a million two, whatever it might be, 15 years later.

71
00:05:57,737 --> 00:06:05,642
[SPEAKER_17]: And you don't want to get caught into the same trap that you got caught in before to buy and fix new schools, whether you go from 12 to three or whatever the amount was.

72
00:06:05,662 --> 00:06:08,043
[SPEAKER_17]: You built new schools because the old ones weren't maintained.

73
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,485
[SPEAKER_17]: And you're going to be looking at the same argument that's going to be presenting itself

74
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:13,800
[SPEAKER_17]: as it relates to the high school later on this evening.

75
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,121
[SPEAKER_17]: But this is too important of an issue.

76
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:28,827
[SPEAKER_17]: You're talking about at the outset $22 million, $2 million for the alleged, I don't know where that dollar amount came from because I don't think any of you can answer how she came up with $2 million, and $20 million to pay for the station.

77
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:39,633
[SPEAKER_17]: And as you heard here a couple of weeks ago when you had the director of finance up here, they're talking about 2022 before anything might be eligible for expiration of bonds that would be needed to pay for this.

78
00:06:40,842 --> 00:06:46,865
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think in all fairness, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to, there's no reason to jump into this thing tonight.

79
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:49,966
[SPEAKER_17]: You've waited a long period of time.

80
00:06:50,687 --> 00:06:55,169
[SPEAKER_17]: You haven't even satisfied the argument of where the training center would go and the fire department.

81
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:57,170
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we remember correctly, I think it was

82
00:06:57,657 --> 00:07:06,806
[SPEAKER_17]: When the first reading took place, because the fire department were here in mass numbers, the mayor decided to include them in any future development as to where they might go.

83
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:11,911
[SPEAKER_17]: To this date, the police department or its union have yet to be involved.

84
00:07:12,692 --> 00:07:16,476
[SPEAKER_17]: And you folks have yet to be involved in any type of involvement with this thing.

85
00:07:16,496 --> 00:07:17,577
[SPEAKER_17]: And it just doesn't make sense.

86
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:19,839
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not good political sense.

87
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,681
[SPEAKER_17]: It's absolutely not good financial sense.

88
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:26,291
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, you have over $28 million in the deficit in your pension system.

89
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:32,854
[SPEAKER_17]: You have an application, as you're well aware of, Mr. President, before the Massachusetts Library Association for $20 million.

90
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:35,615
[SPEAKER_17]: And if that comes through, the city of Medford pays 40% of that.

91
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:44,439
[SPEAKER_17]: And you're looking at probably approximately over the next two or three years, if in fact the high school goes forward and gets its application approved with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

92
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,174
[SPEAKER_17]: $25 million there of taxpayers' money.

93
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:50,638
[SPEAKER_17]: You're looking at a fire station and a police station.

94
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:53,522
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you please tell me who's going to pay for this?

95
00:07:54,564 --> 00:07:57,809
[SPEAKER_17]: This is nothing more than a leading to Proposition 2.5 override.

96
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,372
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you look at your sister city of Somerville,

97
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:16,706
[SPEAKER_17]: With all the development that has taken place over there, they have still raised their taxes on two, a single two and three family homes, which goes to prove and tell you that development for the sake of development is not always in the best interest of this community or any community.

98
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:19,308
[SPEAKER_17]: You really need to look at the long-term approach.

99
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:25,237
[SPEAKER_17]: And the long-term approach right now would say, one more week, I don't think, is going to make a big thing.

100
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:31,740
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, you're people all talking about transparency and being fluid and having this conversation with the mayor.

101
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:38,083
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, where is there all a branch extended to you to sit down and discuss and talk with you about this?

102
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:39,303
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not there.

103
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:40,464
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not there.

104
00:08:41,084 --> 00:08:43,465
[SPEAKER_17]: And what you're doing is the bottom line.

105
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:48,487
[SPEAKER_17]: And what you're doing, you're just accelerating the use and the argument

106
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:52,777
[SPEAKER_17]: to have more people run for this city council and to run for mayor of this community.

107
00:08:53,138 --> 00:09:00,547
[SPEAKER_17]: Because people are sick and tired and fed, and fed up of being told about all these expenses and not being a part of it, not being included.

108
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:03,871
[SPEAKER_17]: And the council, likewise, not including them in the process.

109
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,339
[SPEAKER_17]: You're not talking about $100,000.

110
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:09,541
[SPEAKER_17]: You're talking about $22 million right now.

111
00:09:10,222 --> 00:09:13,824
[SPEAKER_17]: $2 million for the study, $20 million allegedly for the station.

112
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:16,686
[SPEAKER_17]: None of you can explain how it's going to be paid.

113
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:20,388
[SPEAKER_17]: None of you can explain how she got to the $2 million seismographic study.

114
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:23,551
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't even know if an RFQ went out, whatever it might be.

115
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,553
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the move is wrong tonight if you vote for this.

116
00:09:26,993 --> 00:09:28,114
[SPEAKER_17]: That sends the wrong message.

117
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,815
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's definitely, definitely not taxpayer.

118
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:32,857
[SPEAKER_17]: People are police department friendly.

119
00:09:33,922 --> 00:09:34,302
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

120
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:34,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

121
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:41,025
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

122
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:54,091
[SPEAKER_14]: I would, with due respect, with regards to the resolve that was approved several weeks back, that we sit down and discuss this in more depth and ask the questions.

123
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:59,053
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, like I said before, the headquarters building went down last week.

124
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:00,614
[SPEAKER_14]: The backup generator went down.

125
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:03,715
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a whole host of issues within that whole building.

126
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:10,037
[SPEAKER_14]: And when we're talking, I mean, the last speaker just hit the nail on the head.

127
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:24,203
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about potential library, promised new fire station somewhere between 2022 and 2025, Medford High School potential updates, and maintenance of the rest of our schools and city buildings.

128
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:29,105
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we need to be on the same page and not just, I mean, I feel like

129
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,829
[SPEAKER_14]: This was so reactive, we need to be on the same page.

130
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:40,733
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would ask that we table this for one week to sit down with the mayor before we vote on it or potentially vote on it next Tuesday so we can hash some things out.

131
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:51,639
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn to table this for one week so we can have some discussion with the mayor.

132
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Marks.

133
00:10:56,896 --> 00:10:57,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

134
00:10:58,536 --> 00:11:21,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember the vote that Council Lungo-Koehn is speaking about, and it was a 6 to 1 vote requesting that we meet with the administration, in particular the mayor, and discuss not only the building of the police department, also the feasibility and capital improvement plan of where we're going for future projects.

135
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:24,546
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we'll hear tonight, we have the superintendent of schools here.

136
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:29,790
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to hear about a need for improvements within the Medford Public Schools.

137
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:38,896
[SPEAKER_08]: As was mentioned by Councilor Longo, we already know the public library is in need of some repairs or total rehab.

138
00:11:39,537 --> 00:11:45,341
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are a number of other issues, Mr. President, that I'm sure will be addressed when the superintendent gets up.

139
00:11:45,861 --> 00:11:48,403
[SPEAKER_08]: But we should have a master plan, Mr. President.

140
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:57,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know Councilor Falco has spoken about a master plan in the past and I've raised the issue to give at least a direction on where we're going to go.

141
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:04,606
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can't continue to operate and do business with the mayor's draft proposal of a capital plan.

142
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:09,552
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not even a capital plan, it's a draft proposal that the mayor is still working from.

143
00:12:10,247 --> 00:12:20,048
[SPEAKER_08]: And many of the issues in the draft proposal are not present in the letter that she wrote on March 17th to this council stating what the public schools needs.

144
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:21,518
[SPEAKER_08]: needs are.

145
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:26,921
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not quite sure, Mr. President, where all this dialogue and debate is happening.

146
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:35,065
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably happening in a vacuum in the mayor's office, but it's clearly not with the elected officials in this community and with the general public in this community.

147
00:12:35,665 --> 00:12:45,050
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would agree, I think one week is not too long to wait to get some feedback on where we're going with the capital plan, Mr. President.

148
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,532
[SPEAKER_08]: And as the council president, I think you should be wary of

149
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:56,965
[SPEAKER_08]: the fact that we're receiving things piecemeal again, and we've stated in the past that we refuse to do business like that.

150
00:12:57,005 --> 00:13:04,309
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't operate my business, or I don't run my home that way, and we shouldn't operate a city government that way either, Mr. President.

151
00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:08,431
[SPEAKER_08]: So I support Councilor Lungo's motion to table for one week.

152
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:10,872
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lungo, go ahead.

153
00:13:11,272 --> 00:13:13,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Just briefly, thank you, President Caraviello.

154
00:13:13,673 --> 00:13:17,755
[SPEAKER_14]: I think one simple thing that needs to be done, even if we can't discuss

155
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,751
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, everything within a week.

156
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:25,833
[SPEAKER_14]: I think one thing that needs to be done is that capital plan that we were given about 9669 months ago.

157
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,434
[SPEAKER_14]: It's completely changed.

158
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:33,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, something that was supposed to be done seven years from now is now being asked for the third reading tonight.

159
00:13:33,517 --> 00:13:34,857
[SPEAKER_14]: So that needs to be revamped.

160
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:43,861
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, redrafted basically because the largest thing within that five year plan was the metric police station or, you know, an update in that of that building.

161
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:46,182
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is completely changed the whole

162
00:13:46,588 --> 00:13:48,268
[SPEAKER_14]: draft capital plan.

163
00:13:48,308 --> 00:13:55,730
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's just one simple thing that could be looked into and given to us within a week's time so that we have a better idea.

164
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if it is just a draft, it's a better idea of where we're going, how we're moving forward.

165
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:08,372
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's something that's necessary and we're not going to get it unless if we keep rubber stamping everything that's put before us.

166
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:10,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

167
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:15,373
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Alango-Kern to table this for one week,

168
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:18,808

[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

208
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:33,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Can we take 17-312 out of order?

209
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:33,513
[SPEAKER_07]: 17-312.

210
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:40,415
[SPEAKER_07]: To the honorable presidents and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Method Mast.

211
00:15:40,435 --> 00:15:41,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Dear Mr. President and City Council,

212
00:15:42,698 --> 00:15:54,500
[SPEAKER_07]: On behalf of the School Committee, I respectfully request to recommend that the City Council approve and authorize the submission to the Massachusetts School Building Authority a statement of interest.

213
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,861
[SPEAKER_07]: The City of Method School Committee has previously approved the same.

214
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:08,063
[SPEAKER_07]: The documentation will be provided by Superintendent Roy Belson, who will be in attendance, to explain this matter in further depth and detail.

215
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, Mr. Superintendent.

216
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,341
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

217
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:17,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Roy Bellison, Superintendent of Schools, 2500 Mystic Valley Parkway, Medford, Massachusetts.

218
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:21,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, members of the Council, thank you for hearing us this evening.

219
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:35,847
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford School Committee recently approved a statement of interest to the Massachusetts School Building Authority, the purpose of which is to be very proactive and to find out, under the core program,

220
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:46,856
[SPEAKER_09]: that is funded by MSBA, what projects would be fundable for Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School going forward?

221
00:16:47,537 --> 00:16:51,600
[SPEAKER_09]: This particular SOI does not bind the city financially in any way.

222
00:16:52,201 --> 00:17:03,370
[SPEAKER_09]: What it does is it enables the process to begin and to bring out a team from MSBA to sit with us to go over the various projects that may be possible

223
00:17:04,022 --> 00:17:10,463
[SPEAKER_09]: and to determine what they would be considered eligible for possible funding going forward.

224
00:17:11,484 --> 00:17:30,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if in fact they identify projects that are eligible for going forward, we would then have to come back to you and talk to you about the possibility of doing a feasibility study, which would then possibly lead to design, and then later construction documents, which would then lead to an actual implementation.

225
00:17:31,168 --> 00:17:32,688
[SPEAKER_09]: But at this point, all we're asking

226
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:47,412
[SPEAKER_09]: you for is approval to submit to the state an opportunity to meet with their team to review what we have at our schools and determine what is eligible for funding under their current funding structure.

227
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:49,826
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a very proactive thing.

228
00:17:49,886 --> 00:17:56,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's consistent with what I just heard about being part of a plan rather than simply asking for an item at a time.

229
00:17:56,851 --> 00:18:09,480
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that it's the kind of thing that we want to do to know what we can go forward with on our own or what we should go forward with on our own and what we clearly need support from the state for or could be eligible for support from the state.

230
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:17,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's particularly significant since as we look at the future, inflation of construction costs certainly goes up.

231
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:27,776
[SPEAKER_09]: and the possibility of the reduction of reimbursement goes down as the city's wealth increases and our eligibility for a higher reimbursement rate might decrease.

232
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:33,501
[SPEAKER_09]: This is clearly something that would, if it goes forward, would be a two to three year activity.

233
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:42,549
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't be something that would happen overnight, but it would be something that enables us to get into the discussion range with the MSBA.

234
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:46,092
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that, I just ask that the City Council

235
00:18:46,618 --> 00:19:01,187
[SPEAKER_09]: approve what the school committee has already approved, allow us to submit a statement of interest to MSBA so that we can begin the process of exploring what might be helpful to us in Medford and what we can have the state share the cost of.

236
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:03,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy to take any questions.

237
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:05,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendents.

238
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:06,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

239
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,533
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

240
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:15,056
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Billson for, Superintendent Billson, for coming before us with this paper.

241
00:19:15,677 --> 00:19:16,097
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could

242
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:31,956
[SPEAKER_14]: maybe with your experience, go over what type of projects would be funded through these types of 55% reimbursement grants, just so we can kind of have an idea of, I guess, the history of the grants.

243
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:33,496
[SPEAKER_14]: And that would be my first question.

244
00:19:33,676 --> 00:19:38,818
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are two programs at MSBA that take place.

245
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:40,438
[SPEAKER_09]: One is called Accelerated Repair.

246
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,909
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not the program we're applying under.

247
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:49,195
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the core program for renovation and rebuilding and possible new construction.

248
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,177
[SPEAKER_09]: There are priorities.

249
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:54,861
[SPEAKER_09]: There are different seven priorities that the state lists that they would consider.

250
00:19:55,681 --> 00:20:00,226
[SPEAKER_09]: We have selected four of them that we've brought in front of you.

251
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:12,733
[SPEAKER_09]: All the items listed may not be items we're interested in, but we put them down because if the state comes out, we'll talk about everything that's possible and see what their interest level is.

252
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:20,378
[SPEAKER_09]: So, for example, it's highly unlikely that we're interested in boilers because we just replaced the boilers, okay, at Medford High School.

253
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:24,040
[SPEAKER_09]: But we put it down because boilers lead to a discussion of heating systems.

254
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,503
[SPEAKER_09]: An important thing to talk about is an upgrade, if you will, of the fire alarm system.

255
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:31,847
[SPEAKER_09]: at Medford High School, it goes back to 1970.

256
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:36,992
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's clear that this is a good time to look at the fire alarm system.

257
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:41,056
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that the roof was replaced in 2001.

258
00:20:42,137 --> 00:20:44,620
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that at some point in time, the roof is going to need

259
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:45,853
[SPEAKER_09]: a replacement.

260
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:47,293
[SPEAKER_09]: We think it's five, six years out.

261
00:20:47,974 --> 00:20:52,394
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we got funding for it, it would be propitious to move forward with that.

262
00:20:53,134 --> 00:20:59,196
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that the vocational school is moving into very high-tech areas.

263
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:09,317
[SPEAKER_09]: And anything that would allow us to improve our shops in ways that would enable us to offer state-of-the-art programs above and beyond what we're currently doing is an advantage.

264
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:12,478
[SPEAKER_09]: So anything that moves the show forward

265
00:21:12,823 --> 00:21:18,607
[SPEAKER_09]: enables us to look at the things that would be useful going forward as something that we would like to explore.

266
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,949
[SPEAKER_09]: Another example would be the floor tiles.

267
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,732
[SPEAKER_09]: The floor tiles contain a certain amount of asbestos in them.

268
00:21:25,232 --> 00:21:32,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, they're not dangerous because they're not friable, but you can't pick them up without an abatement, and an abatement costs a lot of money.

269
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:42,305
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we're going to have to change the flooring, if we're going to improve the flooring and things of that type, then we should have somebody else join with us and partner with us in the funding of it.

270
00:21:42,855 --> 00:21:45,216
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are the kinds of discussions we would like to have.

271
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:53,778
[SPEAKER_09]: We certainly know that some things they'll tell us we're not high enough priority for because there are other places that are in greater need.

272
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:58,760
[SPEAKER_09]: But there are some things that might actually fly through and we'd like to find out what they are.

273
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,302
[SPEAKER_09]: And that will inform not only a funding proposal potentially going forward, which would then come before you again.

274
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:12,343
[SPEAKER_09]: But it also informs what we would then push for in local capital funding, which would be necessary to do.

275
00:22:12,684 --> 00:22:17,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Technology is another major area, with testing now being done on computers, with

276
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:30,267
[SPEAKER_09]: reporting all being done on computers and data management and the like, it's critical that, you know, our technology be totally up to date and 100% that we continue to move forward with that area.

277
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:32,849
[SPEAKER_09]: That's an area that might be of interest to the state.

278
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:34,590
[SPEAKER_09]: We certainly would move forward with that.

279
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:42,936
[SPEAKER_09]: We've also applied or will apply under the e-rate program, the universal libraries program, and we think we're eligible for about $600,000 there on top of this.

280
00:22:44,941 --> 00:22:46,742
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are things that we're looking at.

281
00:22:46,862 --> 00:22:48,984
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to advance our possibilities.

282
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:55,129
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to put before you all the possibilities for outside funding that will complement local funding.

283
00:22:55,869 --> 00:23:04,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And the only way we can find out is if we sit with the state in a formal process and review and explore what they would consider a priority for Medford.

284
00:23:05,436 --> 00:23:06,697
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

285
00:23:07,077 --> 00:23:14,683
[SPEAKER_14]: That kind of answered what was going to be my second question, kind of as, what is Medford looking for for our high school?

286
00:23:15,276 --> 00:23:19,858
[SPEAKER_14]: versus what in the past these grants have been used for in other cities and towns.

287
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:32,885
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, did the school committee or did you bring anything for us tonight with regards to a list, something in writing that says what the city of Medford's needs are for the high school?

288
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the SOI includes everything.

289
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,861
[SPEAKER_09]: The SOI just simply talks about everything possible.

290
00:23:40,342 --> 00:23:48,447
[SPEAKER_09]: We would look at the entire building with MSBA and not leave anything out that they might consider eligible for funding.

291
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:56,453
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee obviously wants to anticipate possible needs going forward, as I indicated, flooring, staircases,

292
00:23:57,217 --> 00:24:05,046
[SPEAKER_09]: The fire alarm system, these are things, the roof, these are things that should be looked at because the building is going to be 50 years old in another couple of years.

293
00:24:05,727 --> 00:24:07,369
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have a very solid building.

294
00:24:08,591 --> 00:24:10,533
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a building that needs to be replaced.

295
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:14,458
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't buy a CMU building anymore.

296
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:17,298
[SPEAKER_09]: with the kind of money out there.

297
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:20,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Somerville is, what, $250 million to replace a building?

298
00:24:21,399 --> 00:24:23,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Minuteman is $155 million.

299
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Waltham's looking at a couple hundred million.

300
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:27,761
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not going to spend that kind of money.

301
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:39,744
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the solid structure, but we have to make sure the internal systems are going to be up to date so they can go for another 40, 50 years before someone has to consider whether this building has any further life.

302
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,051
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's sort of what we're looking at.

303
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:46,255
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the school committee wants to understand and hear what the state is willing to fund.

304
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:52,021
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we have a very extensive list of just almost a laundry list of everything we would look at.

305
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:54,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

306
00:24:55,144 --> 00:24:57,005
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have the list to provide to us?

307
00:24:57,286 --> 00:24:57,726
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on here.

308
00:24:58,587 --> 00:25:03,792
[SPEAKER_09]: If you read through, you'll see the things that the school committee approved as things they would like the MSBA to look at.

309
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:13,233
[SPEAKER_14]: Where is that list?

310
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:18,235
[SPEAKER_14]: I have like a list that says number one and then on the second page it says number six, number seven.

311
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:20,396
[SPEAKER_09]: That it references.

312
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:28,638
[SPEAKER_09]: So under each of the four priorities to address, we list a whole series of things we'd like MSBA to look at with us.

313
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:32,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that on the last page, number six, number seven?

314
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are one, the last two pages.

315
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:40,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Dello Russo.

316
00:25:41,113 --> 00:25:43,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that on the document dated March 17th, 2017?

317
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:45,236
[SPEAKER_03]: March 16th, 2017.

318
00:25:46,457 --> 00:25:47,137
[SPEAKER_09]: March 16th.

319
00:25:47,177 --> 00:25:50,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, well, my address is March 17th, mine's March 16th.

320
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor LaRusso.

321
00:25:55,443 --> 00:26:07,912
[SPEAKER_14]: So just so I understand it better, would the SOI come in and bring in their own experts so they would know how out of date our systems are or when they're going to eventually need updating?

322
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:09,214
[SPEAKER_14]: Exactly.

323
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:16,720
[SPEAKER_14]: So the heating experts, so they would be telling us, the first priority is the roof, then the heating, then the boilers have another 10 years.

324
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:21,584
[SPEAKER_14]: So they'd give you a list and say, you are eligible for these funds and not these.

325
00:26:21,744 --> 00:26:22,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

326
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:25,787
[SPEAKER_09]: They would tell us, these are the things that we would consider funding with you.

327
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:27,988
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the things you're going to do yourself.

328
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:29,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, if I can.

329
00:26:31,151 --> 00:26:33,112
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

330
00:26:33,412 --> 00:26:37,976
[SPEAKER_16]: From what you just said, Mr. Superintendent, what Councilwoman

331
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:48,305
[SPEAKER_16]: Longo just mentioned, the confusion that I want to make clear is, you're telling us they'll tell us what we can do.

332
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:57,090
[SPEAKER_16]: But let's say something is needed today.

333
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,211
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're saying, let's say the HVAC needs to be done today.

334
00:27:01,632 --> 00:27:04,393
[SPEAKER_16]: But they had that on their list as three to be funded.

335
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:15,736
[SPEAKER_16]: Are we going to fund their request instead of what we think is, like the HVAC, that's probably the... So that's a discussion, Councilor, that we would have.

336
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,177
[SPEAKER_09]: First we want to know who's going to join with us on what projects.

337
00:27:19,777 --> 00:27:28,760
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the school committee, and then obviously you, because you have to bond with us, to determine which items will take precedence and priority.

338
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Because otherwise, you know, we have a plan that

339
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:40,429
[SPEAKER_09]: might avoid doing something that we consider more important and MSBA might not consider as a priority for them.

340
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:50,293
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have to begin to understand what they will fund so we can understand how many dollars we might have left to tackle other issues and go back and forth.

341
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:53,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it may be something they're willing to fund that we don't care to fund in the short term.

342
00:27:55,418 --> 00:28:00,140
[SPEAKER_09]: We can keep it on the boards, but once they determine it's eligible, we can go back and apply for it.

343
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:13,486
[SPEAKER_09]: So the goal is to know what we can apply for so that we know which items have to be funded by ourselves and which items can be funded in partnership, and then to determine the prioritization and the timing of each of these projects.

344
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:21,150
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of my last questions, with regards to the amount of these grants that are given,

345
00:28:22,461 --> 00:28:28,885
[SPEAKER_14]: if you know from other cities and towns that have got them in the past, or if Medford has gotten any, what are we talking?

346
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:33,568
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we talking you'll maybe get a grant for one or two things?

347
00:28:33,728 --> 00:28:35,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a cap amount-wise?

348
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:39,691
[SPEAKER_14]: Or are we talking, are we potentially $20, $30 million?

349
00:28:40,732 --> 00:28:43,533
[SPEAKER_09]: It really depends on what they determine eligibility.

350
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:48,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Somerville, when they're rebuilding the high school, I guess, is eligible for about $130 million.

351
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:50,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?

352
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,990
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we're not, I don't think we're in that category.

353
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,812
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking at something much smaller than that.

354
00:28:55,892 --> 00:29:02,598
[SPEAKER_09]: But clearly, whatever they determine we're eligible for, we'll put a price tag on it after we do some feasibility work.

355
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:08,402
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we can decide how much this community wants to invest at this particular point in time or going forward.

356
00:29:09,043 --> 00:29:10,044
[SPEAKER_09]: But at least we know

357
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:20,963
[SPEAKER_09]: what our partners are willing to put up on the table so that we can give you an informed proposal for both local capital planning and partnered capital planning.

358
00:29:22,244 --> 00:29:36,610
[SPEAKER_14]: And my last question, I guess, would be with regards to, I guess, the whole system, Medford High School and all of our other elementary and grade schools with regards to every school needing maintenance, having maintenance issues.

359
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,450
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard from a few

360
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:43,497
[SPEAKER_14]: parents over the last month or so and beyond with regards to issues within each school.

361
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:54,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Have the grade schools and the elementary schools also been looked at with regards to their needs and how we are going to kind of assess it all, this and the grade schools?

362
00:29:54,422 --> 00:29:57,063
[SPEAKER_09]: So the school committee had several meetings on this topic.

363
00:29:57,723 --> 00:30:03,686
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's our impression that while there are things to be done at every school, obviously you have to keep it up.

364
00:30:05,676 --> 00:30:08,477
[SPEAKER_09]: The major issues will be going forward at the high school.

365
00:30:08,498 --> 00:30:12,540
[SPEAKER_09]: High school is now the oldest major building in our possession.

366
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:33,871
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things I told the school committee, so I feel comfortable sharing it here, is that in next year's budget, I will look to increase the amount of money put in for maintenance across the board so that we can do some of the things that people have raised independent of any capital planning and independent of any state-funded planning.

367
00:30:34,296 --> 00:30:38,539
[SPEAKER_09]: We also have grants, as we've indicated before, that are also giving us money.

368
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,883
[SPEAKER_09]: For example, we got $100,000 or just under $100,000 in biosciences recently.

369
00:30:44,404 --> 00:30:51,449
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a $500,000 grant in capital skills development from the state just the other day, a week ago Friday.

370
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:54,231
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've got some other grants out there they're looking for.

371
00:30:54,271 --> 00:31:00,876
[SPEAKER_09]: There's about $600,000, $700,000 in technology funding that we are eligible for that we're putting together the proposed for.

372
00:31:00,896 --> 00:31:03,498
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an entitlement as long as we meet certain requirements.

373
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:19,032
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're putting all of this together to come so that we can actually deal with issues with other people's money as much as possible, but certainly recognizing that not everything that we want to do will be eligible for funding by an outside agency.

374
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:20,973
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it for now.

375
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:21,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

376
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:22,173
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

377
00:31:23,714 --> 00:31:24,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

378
00:31:24,594 --> 00:31:26,095
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

379
00:31:26,115 --> 00:31:29,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent Felsen.

380
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:30,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for the report.

381
00:31:30,957 --> 00:31:31,978
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with you.

382
00:31:32,717 --> 00:31:34,078
[SPEAKER_15]: The building is 50 years old.

383
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:35,718
[SPEAKER_15]: It was going to be 50 years old.

384
00:31:36,378 --> 00:31:38,379
[SPEAKER_15]: It definitely needs improvements.

385
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,921
[SPEAKER_15]: I talk to parents on a daily basis.

386
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:47,303
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of parents that don't have kids at the high school yet, but they've been up to the high school.

387
00:31:47,623 --> 00:31:49,624
[SPEAKER_15]: And the building does need work.

388
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:59,028
[SPEAKER_15]: When I was on the school committee with Councilor Scarpelli, we had the science lab renovation, 17 new science labs, which was

389
00:32:01,124 --> 00:32:09,387
[SPEAKER_15]: a great project for the community, for the school system, and really, you know, the state-of-the-art school labs and science labs.

390
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:15,729
[SPEAKER_15]: And these are important, especially for programming, future programming for the vocational school.

391
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:19,950
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, we want to make sure that we have these programs in place.

392
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,531
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to make sure our buildings are up to date.

393
00:32:22,851 --> 00:32:27,413
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's one thing that I learned when I was on the school committee is people have an option.

394
00:32:27,885 --> 00:32:28,785
[SPEAKER_15]: people have a choice.

395
00:32:29,025 --> 00:32:30,566
[SPEAKER_15]: Years ago, you went to Medford High School.

396
00:32:31,246 --> 00:32:32,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe you went to parochial school.

397
00:32:32,746 --> 00:32:34,946
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you can go to public school, public charter school.

398
00:32:35,307 --> 00:32:36,987
[SPEAKER_15]: You can go to private school, parochial school.

399
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:38,887
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there's all kinds of options for people now.

400
00:32:39,327 --> 00:32:55,471
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think a lot of people would like to go to school right here in Medford, but they want to make sure that their facilities are first class in nature and make sure that the programs that are being offered, for example, at the vocational school, are first rate.

401
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:57,411
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we're heading in that direction.

402
00:32:58,442 --> 00:33:01,563
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think we do need a cash infusion to make sure that a lot of this happens.

403
00:33:02,184 --> 00:33:09,347
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's nice to see that to potentially get 55% reimbursement from the state, that doesn't come along every day.

404
00:33:09,807 --> 00:33:12,048
[SPEAKER_15]: And we took advantage of that opportunity.

405
00:33:12,428 --> 00:33:19,291
[SPEAKER_15]: When the science labs came across, I think we got 55, maybe even a little bit more, a little bit more.

406
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:21,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Between 55 and 60%, I think, reimbursement on those.

407
00:33:22,473 --> 00:33:24,053
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think this is a great opportunity.

408
00:33:25,494 --> 00:33:28,015
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that it's something that we should take advantage of.

409
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:33,054
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the questions that I had with regard to, you mentioned HVAC.

410
00:33:33,774 --> 00:33:38,176
[SPEAKER_15]: So would the HVAC include the actual individual heating systems in each of the classrooms at the high school?

411
00:33:38,656 --> 00:33:48,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that's perfect because I know one of the complaints that I got when I was on the school committee was, you know, it'd be hot and cold in some of the buildings and sometimes there'd be no heat at all.

412
00:33:48,719 --> 00:33:52,660
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that would be a definite good addition.

413
00:33:55,604 --> 00:34:11,355
[SPEAKER_15]: I also want to talk about the, let's see, you mentioned here in this memo it says, number seven, replacement of or addition to obsolete buildings in order to provide a full range of programs consistent with state and approved local requirements.

414
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:20,541
[SPEAKER_15]: MPS is seeking additional space on the high school campus by adding a cafeteria that can accommodate up to at least 500 students, a performing arts center that can accommodate up to 1,000 guests,

415
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:32,332
[SPEAKER_15]: adequate locker room facilities for male and female athletes, a fitness and wellness center, and expansion of vocational technical space to create a career pathway model.

416
00:34:32,952 --> 00:34:34,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you comment on that a little bit?

417
00:34:34,453 --> 00:34:40,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that talking about possibly a new structure, or is that building off the structures that we currently have?

418
00:34:40,334 --> 00:34:41,834
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me give you a couple of examples.

419
00:34:42,754 --> 00:34:50,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone who's been up to high school, by the way, with a lot of, and with your help, by the way, and I appreciate that, a lot of capital projects have been done, and I could enumerate them

420
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:55,753
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, at some point, if you're interested, the council has approved money for them, so I appreciate that.

421
00:34:56,653 --> 00:34:58,814
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's take the locker rooms at the high school.

422
00:34:59,335 --> 00:35:00,795
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been up to the locker rooms at the high school.

423
00:35:00,815 --> 00:35:05,078
[SPEAKER_09]: You know they're old, and you know that they're not particularly what we want them to be.

424
00:35:05,578 --> 00:35:08,139
[SPEAKER_09]: The girls' locker room, it is what it is.

425
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,201
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of old things in there.

426
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:12,762
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of old marble, old shower stalls.

427
00:35:13,229 --> 00:35:16,072
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot of empty space, unutilized space.

428
00:35:16,593 --> 00:35:18,194
[SPEAKER_09]: That needs to be redone.

429
00:35:18,214 --> 00:35:26,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if it's redone, we'll recapture some space for other programming, and we can provide a state-of-the-art locker room for the young women to use it.

430
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:29,967
[SPEAKER_09]: The same thing is true with the men's locker room.

431
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:31,713
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to do that.

432
00:35:32,034 --> 00:35:33,314
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just these are the things that are there.

433
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:48,842
[SPEAKER_09]: When you talk about a performing arts center, that may be a little aspirational, you know, in regard because, you know, we're talking about having a program that promotes the theater arts and promotes media and the like, but I don't know that we need to go to 1,000 seats right now.

434
00:35:49,343 --> 00:35:58,727
[SPEAKER_09]: So that may be a little bit aspirational, but the people doing the thinking raised it and said, you know, let's put it down and let's see if there's some interest in doing more with that.

435
00:36:00,543 --> 00:36:02,965
[SPEAKER_09]: I think those are the kinds of cafeteria right now.

436
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:04,226
[SPEAKER_09]: There's three cafeterias.

437
00:36:04,587 --> 00:36:19,580
[SPEAKER_09]: It may be that we can reconfigure them, especially since right now, as you undoubtedly have heard, maybe read in the transcript recently, we're redoing the Cafe Electra into a brand new hospitality and restaurant suite with state money.

438
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:23,369
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's critical because that's going to be up on the first floor.

439
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:24,990
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be a restaurant for the public.

440
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:33,574
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to tie into our partnerships with WIN, which is creating the casino up the street and developing job opportunities.

441
00:36:33,955 --> 00:36:40,598
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to tie into a whole pile of activities and revenue generating activities that will support other programs.

442
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:44,026
[SPEAKER_09]: And that will free up space where Cafe Elector is now.

443
00:36:44,126 --> 00:36:45,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can do some other things with that.

444
00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:51,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a whole process of looking at how we can reconfigure space to our greatest advantage.

445
00:36:52,028 --> 00:36:57,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the print shop, because they don't use the big presses anymore, can now go down to a smaller place.

446
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:01,791
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have to give them the big cavern that they had because they don't use that anymore.

447
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:03,911
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not what printing is about anymore.

448
00:37:04,651 --> 00:37:10,273
[SPEAKER_09]: So Dr. Riccio, for example, has created what we'll call clusters or academies.

449
00:37:10,808 --> 00:37:22,774
[SPEAKER_09]: putting programs together, human service programs together, construction programs together, programs that deal with media and development together, so that they can interact with each other.

450
00:37:23,234 --> 00:37:27,016
[SPEAKER_09]: So that a youngster, when they're trained, is cross-trained for more than one area.

451
00:37:28,076 --> 00:37:30,577
[SPEAKER_09]: That creates great opportunities for our young people.

452
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:33,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of being trained only in one area, you're trained in multiple areas.

453
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:37,401
[SPEAKER_09]: You may have noticed that we've virtually recaptured all the students from Minuteman.

454
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:40,302
[SPEAKER_09]: By next year, we'll have only eight students at Minuteman.

455
00:37:41,233 --> 00:37:46,656
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll have saved a million dollars a year on that alone by putting these programs together.

456
00:37:47,977 --> 00:37:56,783
[SPEAKER_09]: By bringing some students in from the outside, we're recapturing revenue, possibly projecting over two or three years a million dollars a year in new revenue coming into it.

457
00:37:57,103 --> 00:38:05,048
[SPEAKER_09]: This is going to help us weather the storm, whether it's federal cutbacks, state failure to pay, or some of the local issues, the priorities that we have.

458
00:38:05,689 --> 00:38:09,371
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are ways that I think we're moving forward, and I believe that

459
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:18,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking at our school at 50 years of age and looking for another 50 years from that building is a really good time to start and be proactive now.

460
00:38:18,582 --> 00:38:21,243
[SPEAKER_09]: Plan, recognizing we've got to come back to you.

461
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:23,344
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not voting for money tonight.

462
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,724
[SPEAKER_09]: You're voting for planning tonight.

463
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:27,845
[SPEAKER_09]: You're voting to be proactive, to look and see what's possible.

464
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:29,866
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what we were asking you to do.

465
00:38:29,906 --> 00:38:31,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's a great opportunity.

466
00:38:31,586 --> 00:38:31,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

467
00:38:31,926 --> 00:38:33,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

468
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:36,528
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with you with regard to the vocational school.

469
00:38:37,306 --> 00:38:39,547
[SPEAKER_15]: In my opinion, I think it's the hidden jewel of the district.

470
00:38:39,747 --> 00:38:44,189
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there are so many great opportunities that are happening at the vocational school.

471
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:45,149
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, Ms.

472
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Riccio and her staff are doing a great job.

473
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:53,632
[SPEAKER_15]: And I mean, there's so much demand now to go to the vocational school, and it's kind of the best of both worlds.

474
00:38:53,992 --> 00:38:56,713
[SPEAKER_15]: You learn a trade, and you can still go to college if you want.

475
00:38:56,793 --> 00:39:00,154
[SPEAKER_15]: So you really, you have the best of both worlds.

476
00:39:00,535 --> 00:39:01,335
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an exciting time.

477
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:04,116
[SPEAKER_15]: There are more and more young kids going to the vocational school.

478
00:39:04,997 --> 00:39:10,701
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a great time to reinvest, not only in the high school, but in the shops of the vocational school.

479
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:18,285
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, when you think about it, at the end of the day, our buildings are our most important assets with regard to the future of Method students.

480
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:26,090
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to make sure that they are first class and make sure that all of our technology is current as can be.

481
00:39:27,311 --> 00:39:31,713
[SPEAKER_15]: You had mentioned previously about the potential for feasibility studies.

482
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:42,534
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we have to do a feasibility study, is that something that we would have to pay for, or is that something that would be, would the MSBA help out with the cost of something like that?

483
00:39:42,594 --> 00:39:59,801
[SPEAKER_09]: If we become eligible, we would then petition MSBA for the feasibility, a feasibility study for the specific projects that we determined were the priority that we wanted to go with them for, or with, and they would reimburse us

484
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:02,683
[SPEAKER_09]: At the same rate, they would reimburse the construction.

485
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:09,828
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the feasibility study was $500,000 and we're eligible for 50%, we'd get $250,000 back.

486
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:12,049
[SPEAKER_09]: We lay it out, but they reimburse us.

487
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:15,231
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm all set.

488
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:15,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

489
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:16,752
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilman.

490
00:40:16,812 --> 00:40:17,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

491
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:19,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

492
00:40:19,534 --> 00:40:21,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Bellson, thank you for being here this evening.

493
00:40:21,536 --> 00:40:24,257
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you do a great job, and I appreciate you coming down here this evening.

494
00:40:25,938 --> 00:40:28,300
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's safe to say that you feel as though

495
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:32,493
[SPEAKER_05]: going forward with this statement of interest is the most prudent course at this point in time?

496
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:38,717
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets us in the game, and it allows us to consider our options, which I think is really important.

497
00:40:39,078 --> 00:40:43,081
[SPEAKER_09]: Earlier this evening I heard you talking, you want to consider options, well you want to know who's going to pay for what.

498
00:40:43,681 --> 00:40:50,086
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you've got somebody else who wants to pay for it, or will help you pay for it, you want to know that before you put your own money on the table.

499
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:54,220
[SPEAKER_05]: And this matter did come before the school committee and it was endorsed by the school committee?

500
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:54,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

501
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I have the copies of the votes if you need it.

502
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you recall what the vote was?

503
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Pardon me?

504
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you recall what the vote was?

505
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,540
[SPEAKER_09]: 7-0.

506
00:40:59,560 --> 00:40:59,740
[SPEAKER_09]: 7-0.

507
00:41:00,001 --> 00:41:02,481
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's endorsed by the superintendent of schools.

508
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:03,641
[SPEAKER_05]: It's endorsed by the school committee.

509
00:41:04,221 --> 00:41:18,764
[SPEAKER_05]: And the purpose of the paper before us this evening, as I understand it, is that you're really seeking permission to meet with the state to examine what competitive grant opportunities the Massachusetts School Building Authority has out there for us that the Metro Public School District may be eligible for?

510
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:19,504
[SPEAKER_09]: That's correct.

511
00:41:20,716 --> 00:41:30,865
[SPEAKER_05]: by submitting this application in the statement of interest, the Massachusetts School Building Authority in no way guarantees that we're going to receive money in the city of Medford, in no way guarantees that we're going to expend money?

512
00:41:31,306 --> 00:41:31,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

513
00:41:32,727 --> 00:41:33,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Mr. Belson.

514
00:41:33,968 --> 00:41:34,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Move for approval, Mr. President.

515
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:37,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Mox.

516
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:39,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

517
00:41:40,014 --> 00:41:43,477
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to thank Superintendent Belson for being here tonight.

518
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:46,640
[SPEAKER_08]: As the superintendent stated, Mr. President,

519
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:58,630
[SPEAKER_08]: This council, over the last several years, has approved many building programs within the Medford High School and the Medford Public Schools.

520
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,212
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we've been very supportive as a council.

521
00:42:03,113 --> 00:42:08,435
[SPEAKER_08]: My question tonight, Mr. President, is not regarding whether or not the high school needs improvements.

522
00:42:09,075 --> 00:42:16,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I have two students that attend Medford High School, and I can speak firsthand that Medford High School, indeed, needs improvements.

523
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:38,824
[SPEAKER_08]: But my question to the superintendent is, my first question, back in September of 2016, the school committee, along with Mayor Burke, formulated a priority facility improvement list, of which they outlined $13,787,000 worth of repairs in the high school and our other school buildings, of which $10,100,000 was earmarked to Medford High School.

524
00:42:47,642 --> 00:42:55,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Of that 10,100,000, Mr. Superintendent, what percentage of that 10,100,000 is in the current SOI?

525
00:42:56,223 --> 00:43:02,605
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can't tell you that because basically we listed almost everything that we possibly could think of in the SOI.

526
00:43:03,145 --> 00:43:08,146
[SPEAKER_09]: So it really depends on what the state determines would be eligible.

527
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:13,746
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say most of the things that we listed on that would be something we would discuss with them.

528
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:16,727
[SPEAKER_09]: There may be some things that they would say, that's your problem.

529
00:43:17,403 --> 00:43:18,183
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, okay.

530
00:43:18,384 --> 00:43:43,558
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so, and the reason why I asked Mr. Superintendent is, and I'll get into this a little bit later on, but, uh, we were recently told three weeks ago that, uh, in order to build a combined police and fire center, that we were told this by a treasurer collector and also by the mayor that, uh, the amount of money we were looking to bond would cause the city to have to go into a proposition two and a half override.

531
00:43:44,368 --> 00:43:49,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was one of the factors the administration stated why we couldn't bond for $38 million.

532
00:43:50,049 --> 00:44:03,033
[SPEAKER_08]: So the reason why I'm trying to get some facts and figures tonight is I want to make sure that we're not going down the same avenue that the mayor and the treasurer-collector were so adamantly opposed to three weeks ago.

533
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:07,014
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm hoping to get those answers from you tonight.

534
00:44:08,474 --> 00:44:12,035
[SPEAKER_08]: So as part of the SOI, from what I can see,

535
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:37,172
[SPEAKER_08]: The capital plan that was put forth by the mayor and the school committee back in September of 2016 did not include a 500-student cafeteria, did not include a performing arts center for 1,000 students, did not include a fitness center, and did not include, from what I can see, windows and boilers.

536
00:44:39,585 --> 00:44:41,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Now if I could just finish.

537
00:44:41,727 --> 00:44:54,314
[SPEAKER_08]: So based on the $10 million that was out there for other renovations, which included Medford High School flooring, which you mentioned had asbestos, which I would agree needs to be removed.

538
00:44:54,354 --> 00:44:56,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Roof replacement for $2 million.

539
00:44:56,676 --> 00:45:02,079
[SPEAKER_08]: Fire alarm system, which we know has been on the blink for a number of years, for $1,200,000.

540
00:45:05,028 --> 00:45:12,411
[SPEAKER_08]: And $1 million to deconstruct the skateboard area and install modular units in the back of the high school.

541
00:45:14,272 --> 00:45:29,678
[SPEAKER_08]: So at what expense is the addition of a cafeteria for 500 students, a performing arts center for 1,000, fitness center, windows, and boilers going to add to the $10 million that the school committee came out in September of 2016?

542
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:32,018
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so let me try and answer this way.

543
00:45:32,038 --> 00:45:32,959
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all good questions.

544
00:45:32,999 --> 00:45:33,299
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

545
00:45:34,395 --> 00:45:40,939
[SPEAKER_09]: Personally, I allowed the planning team at the high school to put down some of their aspirational things.

546
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:45,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I don't personally think I need a 500-student cafeteria.

547
00:45:46,002 --> 00:45:47,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Personally, I don't think that.

548
00:45:47,543 --> 00:45:53,466
[SPEAKER_09]: But I wouldn't tell my people they can't ask for it and let somebody else tell them, we don't think we'd fund that, OK?

549
00:45:53,926 --> 00:45:59,970
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think that's going to be something MSBA is going to be interested in, because I think they already know we have cafeterias.

550
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:03,972
[SPEAKER_09]: And they'd say, probably, why don't you just put a coat of paint on and do some other things?

551
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:05,396
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think that's an issue.

552
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:07,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information.

553
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

554
00:46:08,498 --> 00:46:11,440
[SPEAKER_08]: And I appreciate what you're saying, but doesn't that just muddy the waters?

555
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:18,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when I look at the SOI request, I'll be quite frank, it looks like we're building a brand new building.

556
00:46:19,747 --> 00:46:26,032
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if you go through the list from roof to boiler to windows to flooring, I mean, it looks like we're building a brand new building.

557
00:46:26,612 --> 00:46:34,218
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think to add stuff into the SOI that maybe you didn't agree upon as superintendent or thought it wasn't a priority,

558
00:46:34,551 --> 00:46:35,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I think muddies the water.

559
00:46:36,852 --> 00:46:51,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we have here, in my opinion, is a project that is probably closer to $30 or $40 million if we were to get total funding or total approval, I should say, from the state.

560
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,262
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know there's reimbursement.

561
00:46:53,622 --> 00:46:55,604
[SPEAKER_08]: The number 55% has been tossed around.

562
00:46:56,044 --> 00:46:58,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I talked to the State Building Assistance Program.

563
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:00,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't bet your bottom dollar on 55%.

564
00:47:01,107 --> 00:47:02,868
[SPEAKER_08]: In the past, we've received

565
00:47:03,285 --> 00:47:05,826
[SPEAKER_08]: upwards of 59% for the science labs.

566
00:47:05,866 --> 00:47:08,088
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is nothing set in stone.

567
00:47:08,668 --> 00:47:16,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I know the mayor put that in her letter, but according to the school building assistance, they have not arrived at any funding percentages as of today.

568
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:21,134
[SPEAKER_08]: So in a good predicament, we could get 50%.

569
00:47:22,115 --> 00:47:25,837
[SPEAKER_08]: But my question, Mr. Superintendent, why throw everything into the mix?

570
00:47:26,717 --> 00:47:29,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Shouldn't we be looking at our major priorities?

571
00:47:29,879 --> 00:47:32,980
[SPEAKER_08]: We should be looking at the major deficiencies in the school?

572
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that's what the SOI calls for.

573
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:36,722
[SPEAKER_08]: It calls for the major deficiencies.

574
00:47:37,203 --> 00:47:45,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And you yourself are saying, I don't think our deficiency is adding a 1,000-person performance center or a 500-person cafeteria.

575
00:47:45,817 --> 00:47:54,901
[SPEAKER_08]: but it may be the alarm system or it may be an issue like Councilor Scarpelli talked about, other building improvements that need to be done immediately.

576
00:47:55,702 --> 00:47:57,283
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's the question.

577
00:47:57,323 --> 00:48:00,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are we throwing everything at the wall right now?

578
00:48:00,364 --> 00:48:03,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, as I said to you, the SOI is a planning document.

579
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:09,749
[SPEAKER_09]: It's to get you into an exploration process and to find out what the state is willing to pay for.

580
00:48:10,189 --> 00:48:12,050
[SPEAKER_09]: So you put down everything to talk about,

581
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:18,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And you find out that they're going to discard a few things here and a few things there, and maybe several things, and say that's really not important enough to us.

582
00:48:19,365 --> 00:48:20,366
[SPEAKER_09]: But we'll find out.

583
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:30,794
[SPEAKER_09]: The document that you had in front of you is really a document that was produced in September, or early on, based on what people thought at that particular time.

584
00:48:31,394 --> 00:48:32,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Different things emerge.

585
00:48:32,828 --> 00:48:34,129
[SPEAKER_09]: People want to talk about them.

586
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:41,633
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some ideas that the headmaster has, that the vocational director has, that, you know, we put it down so that we could explore them with the state.

587
00:48:42,274 --> 00:48:45,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Not because we necessarily think that they're going to fund all these things.

588
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:53,180
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to get into an exploratory process to examine what is possible for partnership with state funding.

589
00:48:54,261 --> 00:48:56,122
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll merge the documents.

590
00:48:56,622 --> 00:48:59,424
[SPEAKER_09]: The key thing you have to remember is we have to come back to you for the money.

591
00:49:00,248 --> 00:49:04,209
[SPEAKER_09]: And any amount that we're going to spend, you're going to prioritize along with the school committee.

592
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:07,370
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not going to be the superintendent who makes the final call.

593
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,870
[SPEAKER_09]: The superintendent might make a recommendation.

594
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:16,852
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're going to decide, and the mayor's going to decide, and the school committee's going to decide how much money you're willing to put on the table at any given point in time.

595
00:49:17,652 --> 00:49:22,353
[SPEAKER_09]: But knowing what's eligible gives you a leg up on what's going on.

596
00:49:22,754 --> 00:49:26,975
[SPEAKER_09]: And as far as the percentage goes, I know what other people are getting at this point in time.

597
00:49:27,035 --> 00:49:28,295
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what the relative things are.

598
00:49:29,328 --> 00:49:31,690
[SPEAKER_09]: The state's not going to commit to something before they see it.

599
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:39,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we fall in that basic line of where we would be eligible, because I know what the economics are between the different communities.

600
00:49:39,895 --> 00:49:45,078
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't mean that it won't go down a little bit, because obviously the wealth of the community is increasing.

601
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,121
[SPEAKER_08]: So Mr. Superintendent, if I could.

602
00:49:50,239 --> 00:50:15,640
[SPEAKER_08]: So based on the laundry list that we're submitting in the SOI, and it is a laundry list, wouldn't it make more sense for us to prioritize what our needs are so we don't count on or have to count on some state bureaucrat coming back saying, you know what, Method, we know you need a fire alarm system and a sprinkler system and windows and an HVA system, but we're gonna give you a cafeteria for 500 students.

603
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,601
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not gonna do that.

604
00:50:17,263 --> 00:50:19,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Secretary, we don't know what's going to happen.

605
00:50:19,865 --> 00:50:27,772
[SPEAKER_08]: But why not put together a list of what our priorities are and not just put together a list of, it sounds great.

606
00:50:28,212 --> 00:50:31,915
[SPEAKER_08]: You put everything in there in the kitchen sink and say, hey, look, we're looking to get funding.

607
00:50:32,255 --> 00:50:35,138
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds great in theory, but it's not practical.

608
00:50:35,698 --> 00:50:38,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe it's practical to put everything in the SOI.

609
00:50:39,001 --> 00:50:43,685
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd rather see, like Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, a list of what our top priorities are.

610
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:50,751
[SPEAKER_08]: and have them go through our top priorities, Mr. Superintendent, and then make a selection from our top priorities.

611
00:50:51,451 --> 00:51:02,814
[SPEAKER_08]: And if a 500 student cafeteria is not on the top of your priority list as superintendent of the school committee's priority list, then that should be at the bottom of the list.

612
00:51:03,914 --> 00:51:07,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Or not on the list at all, Mr. Superintendent.

613
00:51:07,395 --> 00:51:09,375
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear what you're saying, but I'm

614
00:51:10,106 --> 00:51:13,027
[SPEAKER_09]: My experience tells me in meeting, because I've had these meetings before.

615
00:51:13,047 --> 00:51:14,247
[SPEAKER_09]: As you know, we've had science labs.

616
00:51:14,527 --> 00:51:15,848
[SPEAKER_09]: We've built new buildings and so on.

617
00:51:16,128 --> 00:51:21,249
[SPEAKER_09]: My experience tells me that when we sit down with them, we'll focus in on the things that are high priority first.

618
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:26,131
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll look at whether any of these other things are possible.

619
00:51:26,331 --> 00:51:31,953
[SPEAKER_09]: But they know the difference between a firearm system and a roof and a cafeteria.

620
00:51:32,693 --> 00:51:33,453
[SPEAKER_09]: They know the difference.

621
00:51:33,513 --> 00:51:35,974
[SPEAKER_09]: And they know where we would like to go first.

622
00:51:36,354 --> 00:51:38,915
[SPEAKER_09]: This is an attempt to give everybody, every stakeholder,

623
00:51:39,648 --> 00:51:49,755
[SPEAKER_09]: who was involved in the planning process of putting an SOI together, a chance to be heard, rather than say your idea is not worth being explored with the state.

624
00:51:50,156 --> 00:51:51,437
[SPEAKER_09]: We're giving them a chance to be heard.

625
00:51:51,957 --> 00:52:01,304
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know and I know that the state will zero in on firearms and roofs and heating systems long before they worry about the cafeteria.

626
00:52:01,956 --> 00:52:13,040
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we were so concerned of having every stakeholder seat at the table, why don't we see the middle school and elementary schools as a separate S.O.I., Mr. Superintendent, which can be done.

627
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure you know that as superintendent.

628
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:20,522
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no mention about the needs of, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn mentioned, the secondary schools.

629
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:25,281
[SPEAKER_08]: within this, and nor should it be, because this is a high school proposal.

630
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:31,345
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's also proposals that are in need, as you know, in our other schools, in dire need.

631
00:52:31,865 --> 00:52:44,832
[SPEAKER_08]: So my question is then, my second question, Mr. President, is the fact that I realize the order which takes place as you submit the SOI,

632
00:52:45,672 --> 00:52:49,255
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't realize after you submit the SOI then you go sit down with the state people.

633
00:52:49,656 --> 00:52:50,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know that.

634
00:52:50,276 --> 00:52:56,442
[SPEAKER_08]: You're telling me you now then go sit down with the state people and you, what do you do, compromise with them?

635
00:52:56,702 --> 00:53:06,932
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you sit down and you go over and they'll tell you what they would consider to be priorities, what they would consider to be something that they would consider to be of concern to them, what they would like to fund.

636
00:53:07,742 --> 00:53:11,523
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, after all, they're accountable to their funding agency and their board as well.

637
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:19,846
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that they'd be more interested in a fire alarm system, a roof, heating systems, more so than some of the other things.

638
00:53:19,926 --> 00:53:25,108
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, we're giving them all these things, and they might say, you know, we're doing something with this.

639
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Who knew a few years ago that they were going to be funding science labs?

640
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:31,350
[SPEAKER_09]: But we put it in front of them, and we got it.

641
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,551
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you have to try all these things.

642
00:53:34,571 --> 00:53:35,392
[SPEAKER_09]: You put it in front of them.

643
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:36,472
[SPEAKER_09]: You say, are you interested in this?

644
00:53:36,512 --> 00:53:40,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Could you consider this to be a reasonable investment?

645
00:53:40,954 --> 00:53:44,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe someone's going to say, yes, you know, we've got an interest in this at this point in time.

646
00:53:45,357 --> 00:53:48,638
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're moving forward with a planning process.

647
00:53:48,678 --> 00:53:57,263
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all we're doing tonight, asking you to allow us to go forward proactively and find out what the state wants to prioritize in our community.

648
00:53:57,863 --> 00:54:01,965
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is going to take probably two to three years to actually actualize.

649
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,726
[SPEAKER_09]: In the meantime, that will inform, you know, our other capital planning that may have to be locally funded.

650
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:13,651
[SPEAKER_09]: And we will form also our maintenance issues, which will be locally funded.

651
00:54:14,612 --> 00:54:16,874
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and then grant applications we make.

652
00:54:16,914 --> 00:54:23,360
[SPEAKER_09]: If someone were to say we can't get grants for this, you know, for example, we built the, we're building the Culinary Arts and Hospitality Center.

653
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:25,222
[SPEAKER_09]: That wasn't gonna be funded by MSBA.

654
00:54:27,237 --> 00:54:28,678
[SPEAKER_09]: But we got a grant to do it.

655
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:31,440
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have to know where we have to go.

656
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:35,524
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to know what's possible under what set of funding and what's possible under other sets of funding.

657
00:54:36,184 --> 00:54:37,205
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we can then lay it out.

658
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:45,632
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, we're going to have to work with you and the school committee for any kind of local money that's going to be needed to move the project forward.

659
00:54:46,086 --> 00:54:49,847
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't you say yes tonight, and I go off and do whatever I want.

660
00:54:50,327 --> 00:54:54,988
[SPEAKER_09]: This is you say yes tonight, we get the process going, and then we come back to you and sit down.

661
00:54:55,048 --> 00:55:02,250
[SPEAKER_09]: And it should be a robust process, because the city wants to move forward on some good projects, not only in the schools, but in the city.

662
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:03,890
[SPEAKER_09]: And we look forward to that.

663
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:12,932
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I could, Mr. Superintendent, I know you're probably not prepared tonight to put a dollar amount onto your deficiency request.

664
00:55:14,013 --> 00:55:15,893
[SPEAKER_08]: But you were able to put a dollar amount back

665
00:55:16,585 --> 00:55:22,931
[SPEAKER_08]: in September 2016 on the laundry list of items that you mentioned needed repair at the high school.

666
00:55:23,331 --> 00:55:28,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you prepared tonight to put a dollar amount on your SOI request to the state?

667
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,798
[SPEAKER_09]: No, because I don't know, you know,

668
00:55:30,753 --> 00:55:33,514
[SPEAKER_09]: the extent to which any of these things would be funded.

669
00:55:33,534 --> 00:55:35,695
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do know... Now, I'm not talking about funding.

670
00:55:36,116 --> 00:55:38,577
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the actual cost of your SOI request?

671
00:55:38,717 --> 00:55:46,140
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I wouldn't want to, you know, give you a guess right now, because quite frankly, it depends on the extent to which you do them.

672
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:53,504
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and any one of these things might be a partial thing, maybe some windows, maybe some doors, and maybe not all, maybe all doors.

673
00:55:55,365 --> 00:55:57,486
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we, you know, we can do that right now.

674
00:55:57,826 --> 00:55:59,907
[SPEAKER_09]: When we get back from a planning process,

675
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:04,311
[SPEAKER_09]: and we get to a financial phase, then we can do that.

676
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:08,972
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the most prudent way to do it, not to throw speculative numbers out there right now.

677
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And if people come and say, look, that's too much at any one time, then that'll be too much at any one time.

678
00:56:14,513 --> 00:56:29,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so what you're asking then is the council to let you go forward, and then in deliberations, when you submit your SOI with the state, you'll go back and forth with the state, and they'll determine what projects will be done or approved,

679
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:34,246
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they come back and say, you know what, Method, we like everything in your SOI.

680
00:56:34,906 --> 00:56:39,510
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been a lack of requests for school building assistance this year.

681
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:42,692
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to fund you for $60 million, Method.

682
00:56:42,992 --> 00:56:44,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations.

683
00:56:44,413 --> 00:56:45,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're even going to give you half.

684
00:56:45,574 --> 00:56:47,715
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to give you $30 million.

685
00:56:48,055 --> 00:56:50,017
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're going to have to bond for $30 million.

686
00:56:50,397 --> 00:56:57,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you prepared to come back to this city, Mr. Superintendent, with a $30 million bond request within the next two to three years?

687
00:56:58,797 --> 00:57:09,763
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be prepared to come back to you to tell you what your options are and to allow you to decide what the finances of this city is willing to support in support of your public schools.

688
00:57:10,163 --> 00:57:11,264
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all, just like anything else.

689
00:57:11,284 --> 00:57:12,225
[SPEAKER_09]: We come to you with a budget.

690
00:57:12,365 --> 00:57:14,406
[SPEAKER_09]: We come to you with other kinds of financial things.

691
00:57:14,726 --> 00:57:17,548
[SPEAKER_09]: You can tell us how much more you want to put into it.

692
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:22,210
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know, for example, in five or six years, you're going to replace a roof at the high school.

693
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:23,191
[SPEAKER_09]: You are going to do it.

694
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,952
[SPEAKER_09]: The question is, who's going to pay for it?

695
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,183
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we are eligible to get somebody to share that with us, why not find out now?

696
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:36,646
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that there are some heating things that we want to do at the high school that we should do.

697
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:40,088
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't do them in the next few years, you'll end up paying for it.

698
00:57:40,388 --> 00:57:41,889
[SPEAKER_09]: So we should find out if we have a partner.

699
00:57:42,929 --> 00:57:43,990
[SPEAKER_09]: And so on and so forth.

700
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:46,911
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that technology is moving at a rapid rate.

701
00:57:48,072 --> 00:57:53,175
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we know that it's going to be expensive to increase all the technology that's going to be required of public schools,

702
00:57:54,285 --> 00:57:58,227
[SPEAKER_09]: So if someone's willing to partner with us, great.

703
00:57:58,267 --> 00:57:58,847
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll know that.

704
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:00,588
[SPEAKER_09]: That gives you those things.

705
00:58:00,648 --> 00:58:09,632
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can decide that, you know, I'm not interested in a performing arts center, and I'm not interested in an expanded cafeteria, and I don't really care about some other things you're interested in.

706
00:58:09,672 --> 00:58:15,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So even though someone's willing to partner with us, it's off the table for Medford because we have other things we want to do.

707
00:58:16,474 --> 00:58:17,975
[SPEAKER_09]: My job is to give you options.

708
00:58:18,475 --> 00:58:20,576
[SPEAKER_09]: My job is to give you an opportunity to look at it.

709
00:58:21,256 --> 00:58:22,617
[SPEAKER_08]: And who's going to make that decision?

710
00:58:23,085 --> 00:58:27,627
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's just say, in a perfect scenario, the state comes back and said, Medford, we're giving you everything you wanted.

711
00:58:28,387 --> 00:58:29,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Who ultimately is going to make that decision?

712
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:32,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you saying it's this council that's going to sit there?

713
00:58:32,388 --> 00:58:37,270
[SPEAKER_08]: School committee, mayor, and council are the arbiters of dollars and cents.

714
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:37,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

715
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:41,792
[SPEAKER_08]: But we ultimately have the final funding say, Mr. Superintendent.

716
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:49,895
[SPEAKER_08]: So you think this council is going to sit back after the SOI is put in, and if everything works out perfectly, and they come to us and they pay for half,

717
00:58:50,613 --> 00:58:52,233
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're getting everything we want.

718
00:58:52,633 --> 00:59:03,776
[SPEAKER_08]: You think the city council is going to sit here and start slashing different items in the budget to make sure that we don't have a proposition two and a half override?

719
00:59:04,296 --> 00:59:06,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what you expect this council to do?

720
00:59:06,377 --> 00:59:08,377
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my questioning, Mr. Superintendent.

721
00:59:08,717 --> 00:59:12,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are we throwing everything at the wall when we know what deficiencies we have?

722
00:59:12,981 --> 00:59:15,823
[SPEAKER_08]: we should prioritize them right now and move forward on them.

723
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:17,344
[SPEAKER_08]: This program is going nowhere.

724
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:21,367
[SPEAKER_08]: So to make people believe that, hey, that's, you know, let's get a partner today.

725
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:33,515
[SPEAKER_08]: We can get a partner today, tomorrow, next year, the year after this program has been around for years and we've taken advantage for many, many years, Mr. Superintendent, you know, uh, we, we got, uh, for a core program, uh, 59.79%.

726
00:59:33,915 --> 00:59:35,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, uh, it doesn't give the year 2008, I'm sorry.

727
00:59:41,095 --> 00:59:45,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the science labs, we've got 59%, $6 million reimbursement.

728
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:51,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Then the accelerated repair, $2,409,000, they gave us a million dollars.

729
00:59:52,344 --> 00:59:55,046
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know we've been great partners with the state.

730
00:59:55,587 --> 01:00:02,693
[SPEAKER_08]: My concern is eventually, because I've been on this council a number of years, is that eventually the issue's gonna come back before this council.

731
01:00:03,453 --> 01:00:09,338
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're gonna be the ones that are gonna be sitting there saying, geez, you know what, the state wants to give us all this money,

732
01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:12,222
[SPEAKER_08]: but the city council doesn't want to approve it.

733
01:00:12,622 --> 01:00:15,866
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to pay half of this and this and this, but they don't want to approve it.

734
01:00:16,147 --> 01:00:28,802
[SPEAKER_08]: And we know what the purse strings are, Mr. Superintendent, when we hear from the mayor three weeks ago, say that she can't afford to do a combined center for police and fire, because according to her and the treasurer collector,

735
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:35,472
[SPEAKER_08]: that the school bonds will be coming offline in the year 2022, which is five years.

736
01:00:35,952 --> 01:00:40,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And she said we can't afford the spending that we want to do for a combined center until 2022.

737
01:00:41,955 --> 01:00:46,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you're telling us that this project they could be looking for funding maybe two or three years.

738
01:00:47,298 --> 01:00:47,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that correct?

739
01:00:48,619 --> 01:00:53,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what I'm telling you is I'm telling you it'll take two to three years to get through the process to actually get

740
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:57,901
[SPEAKER_09]: construction going on something, any project that gets approved and the like.

741
01:00:57,941 --> 01:01:05,504
[SPEAKER_09]: But we won't even get to design feasibility and design until we come back here and talk about what the state is interested in.

742
01:01:05,964 --> 01:01:13,426
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the feasibility period, that's when you will make some decisions before we actually go forward with a final number.

743
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:18,568
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the reality is that some things will be done over five years, some things may be done over 10 years.

744
01:01:19,783 --> 01:01:24,370
[SPEAKER_09]: The reality is to find out what we can get some funding for and what we can get support for.

745
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:25,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

746
01:01:25,451 --> 01:01:26,433
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is the reality.

747
01:01:26,453 --> 01:01:27,735
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I'm bringing this up.

748
01:01:28,015 --> 01:01:29,477
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a reality behind this.

749
01:01:30,259 --> 01:01:33,183
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I hear from the administration and the treasurer-collector saying,

750
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:46,676
[SPEAKER_08]: that we can't afford any more bonds other than what we just did for the police department until the year 2022, unless we want to look at a Prop 2.5 override, I think every member of this council and every citizen should be concerned about it.

751
01:01:47,076 --> 01:01:50,417
[SPEAKER_08]: And we should have a handle on what we're potentially looking at.

752
01:01:50,878 --> 01:01:54,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And from what you're telling me now, the process is you just submit.

753
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:56,300
[SPEAKER_08]: You really don't know what the dollar amount will be.

754
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,240
[SPEAKER_08]: You just submit it.

755
01:01:57,641 --> 01:01:58,501
[SPEAKER_08]: You hope for the best.

756
01:01:59,141 --> 01:02:00,502
[SPEAKER_08]: And when it comes back, it comes back.

757
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:03,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at that point, you look at the financials.

758
01:02:03,851 --> 01:02:09,212
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I'm telling you is, the mayor just told us three weeks ago, we're looking at five years down the line.

759
01:02:10,092 --> 01:02:13,393
[SPEAKER_08]: And that doesn't seem what we're looking for for these schools.

760
01:02:13,893 --> 01:02:14,954
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I read the SOI.

761
01:02:14,974 --> 01:02:24,536
[SPEAKER_08]: It says an SOI should only be filed for a facility where a district has the ability to gain the proper local approvals and to fund a project in the next two years.

762
01:02:26,054 --> 01:02:34,344
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're putting, you know, they want to see commitment, that's why they're asking for a vote, the school committee and the council, and they want to see a funding commitment.

763
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:37,447
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're at such an early stage.

764
01:02:37,688 --> 01:02:39,169
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that.

765
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:44,656
[SPEAKER_09]: And quite frankly, look, you get hit with a lot of decisions that require you to make tough decisions on money.

766
01:02:45,341 --> 01:02:48,524
[SPEAKER_09]: on policies, on zoning, on any number of issues.

767
01:02:49,104 --> 01:02:55,429
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't hide from, not that you want to, from making tough decisions that make some people happy and some people less happy.

768
01:02:55,549 --> 01:03:04,697
[SPEAKER_08]: With all due respect, you just stated that you put things in this SOI that you didn't want in there because you were hiding from dealing with other people at the table.

769
01:03:04,817 --> 01:03:06,458
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't say people are hiding, Mr. Superintendent.

770
01:03:06,638 --> 01:03:09,300
[SPEAKER_09]: I said I respected the right of the planning team to forward things

771
01:03:12,927 --> 01:03:20,249
[SPEAKER_09]: that I consider to be, that they consider to be important to them, because I want to respect my administrative team and the teachers and others who participate.

772
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:25,251
[SPEAKER_09]: You're the educational leader of this community, Mr. Superintendent, and sometimes you have to make the tough decisions.

773
01:03:25,531 --> 01:03:27,091
[SPEAKER_09]: And I like the participation of people.

774
01:03:27,111 --> 01:03:28,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have to make all the decisions myself.

775
01:03:29,852 --> 01:03:35,134
[SPEAKER_09]: But the reality is that nothing is going to go forward financially unless you decide you can afford it.

776
01:03:35,947 --> 01:03:36,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing's going to go forward.

777
01:03:36,868 --> 01:03:40,490
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to explore who wants to partner with us.

778
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:46,113
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know that the most important things will be systems that are important to the school.

779
01:03:46,153 --> 01:03:51,976
[SPEAKER_09]: The operation of the building will get higher priority than some of the things that maybe are aspirational.

780
01:03:52,397 --> 01:03:52,837
[SPEAKER_09]: You know that.

781
01:03:53,737 --> 01:03:59,823
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you decide that certain things aren't something you want to fund, then you say, well, put that off for a couple of years.

782
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:02,045
[SPEAKER_09]: But certainly, you're going to face a roof.

783
01:04:02,486 --> 01:04:04,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly, you're going to face technology.

784
01:04:04,448 --> 01:04:07,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Certainly, you're going to deal with other systems, heating systems and other things like that.

785
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:11,595
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we don't get in the game now, it'll be longer.

786
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:25,335
[SPEAKER_09]: before we get funding, and if we don't, and if the funding dries up because of the Commonwealth not being able to keep things moving, you see the green line, other things like that, we talk about these things, and it keeps getting pushed off, keeps getting pushed off.

787
01:04:26,035 --> 01:04:31,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get in the game, and then you can decide whether or not it's something you desire as a priority.

788
01:04:32,016 --> 01:04:33,096
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we need to look at.

789
01:04:33,577 --> 01:04:35,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's my job to put it in front of you.

790
01:04:35,797 --> 01:04:42,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope it's your job to, or I hope it's your willingness to let me find out what's possible going forward.

791
01:04:43,339 --> 01:04:52,465
[SPEAKER_08]: So Mr. Superintendent, just getting back to some of the building deficiencies, would you agree that the restrooms at the high school are a deficiency of Medford High School?

792
01:04:53,566 --> 01:04:57,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I would agree that restrooms are something that should be addressed, yes.

793
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:00,191
[SPEAKER_09]: How come they're not part of the SOI?

794
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Because they're part of the general building envelope.

795
01:05:02,452 --> 01:05:03,853
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something that we can talk about.

796
01:05:03,873 --> 01:05:05,114
[SPEAKER_09]: They're part of the plumbing.

797
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:06,975
[SPEAKER_09]: They're part of the heating system, believe it or not.

798
01:05:07,295 --> 01:05:09,577
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all part of the same consideration.

799
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:16,494
[SPEAKER_09]: And just because something isn't written here doesn't mean we can't talk about it with the team that comes out from MSBA.

800
01:05:16,895 --> 01:05:20,237
[SPEAKER_09]: If we think of other things, we can say, you know, by the way, we'd like you to look at this as well.

801
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:28,762
[SPEAKER_09]: This is to get them, to give them an idea of which communities are interested in seeking partnership with the state.

802
01:05:29,563 --> 01:05:32,565
[SPEAKER_08]: So just so I understand, you brought up a good point.

803
01:05:32,945 --> 01:05:37,328
[SPEAKER_08]: So after the April 7th deadline, you're stating that we can add stuff to the SOI?

804
01:05:37,828 --> 01:05:39,249
[SPEAKER_08]: We can talk to them about it, yes.

805
01:05:39,807 --> 01:05:42,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Not talk, we can add stuff after the deadline.

806
01:05:42,871 --> 01:05:43,872
[SPEAKER_09]: We can talk stuff, yes.

807
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:45,795
[SPEAKER_09]: We can talk with them about it.

808
01:05:45,815 --> 01:05:47,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'll let us add, maybe they won't.

809
01:05:47,678 --> 01:05:51,423
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm sure they would consider some of the things that we would bring up.

810
01:05:52,061 --> 01:06:03,151
[SPEAKER_08]: With all due respect, Mr. Superintendent, I've been an advocate for a number of years regarding the cleanliness and the deplorable condition of the bathrooms at the high school.

811
01:06:03,972 --> 01:06:19,325
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's been some headway made, I have to give credit, there's been some headway made with the water bubbles and so forth, but many of the restrooms at the high school are locked down, not because we don't have the manpower to supervise them, it's because they're in deplorable condition, Mr. Superintendent.

812
01:06:20,008 --> 01:06:22,710
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is coming from first-hand knowledge.

813
01:06:23,391 --> 01:06:35,160
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can tell you that the fact that it's not addressed in a deficiency in this program and say, well, it's covered under other things, I think is not adequately addressing the deficiencies that we have at that school.

814
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:41,705
[SPEAKER_08]: It may not be educational in nature, but what I can tell you is that there are kids at the high school that will hold

815
01:06:42,986 --> 01:06:48,511
[SPEAKER_08]: and going to the restroom a whole day because they're so filthy dirty and you can't get toilet paper.

816
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,432
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no soap.

817
01:06:49,632 --> 01:06:50,714
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no paper towels.

818
01:06:51,795 --> 01:06:53,456
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no doors on the urinals.

819
01:06:53,937 --> 01:07:01,004
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just telling you reality, Mr. Superintendent, because you have your own private bathroom and probably don't frequent other restrooms in the building.

820
01:07:01,404 --> 01:07:04,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And I could just tell you that from what I hear from students,

821
01:07:05,228 --> 01:07:07,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent, is that's what's happening up there.

822
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:11,531
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm saddened to see that it's not addressed in the SOI.

823
01:07:12,412 --> 01:07:19,035
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're telling me it could be added at a later date, that's fine, and I hope it does get added, because that would be my addition.

824
01:07:19,976 --> 01:07:21,016
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I'm a stakeholder.

825
01:07:21,096 --> 01:07:22,117
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be my addition.

826
01:07:22,157 --> 01:07:29,701
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly would bring that up in any kind of discussion, but I can tell you that I don't share your full assessment of our bathroom facilities.

827
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:33,863
[SPEAKER_09]: There may be a few that need some additional work, but there's a lot of them that work very well.

828
01:07:34,182 --> 01:07:36,304
[SPEAKER_09]: They're in good shape and are being cleaned on a regular basis.

829
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:37,345
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my exact point.

830
01:07:38,185 --> 01:07:41,949
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you don't share them and that's why they've been in deplorable condition for so many years.

831
01:07:42,669 --> 01:07:45,011
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my exact point, Mr. Superintendent.

832
01:07:46,152 --> 01:07:47,994
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can go back and forth on that.

833
01:07:49,335 --> 01:07:55,781
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, Mr. Superintendent, you were here several months back when we were talking about safety at the high school.

834
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:58,163
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a great debate going back and forth.

835
01:07:58,683 --> 01:08:11,510
[SPEAKER_08]: and I see you mentioned in the SOI that you have the inability to close off certain parts of the building and have the inability to keep it cordoned off to people from outside and so forth.

836
01:08:12,010 --> 01:08:27,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad to see that you're finally admitting that there is a security issue at the high school and that there is concern, Mr. Superintendent, with access to that building throughout the course of the day and that we've been unable to control the access

837
01:08:28,285 --> 01:08:33,446
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm glad to see that you're offering some solutions to that effect, Mr. Superintendent.

838
01:08:33,546 --> 01:08:36,347
[SPEAKER_09]: So for the record, I'm going to tell you the high school is a safe place.

839
01:08:37,167 --> 01:08:40,188
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always more we can do to improve it.

840
01:08:40,508 --> 01:08:44,509
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of the things we have here will add dimensions that we can't do by ourselves.

841
01:08:51,691 --> 01:08:52,911
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all for now, Mr. President.

842
01:08:53,431 --> 01:08:54,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Vice President Mox.

843
01:08:55,812 --> 01:08:56,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

844
01:08:56,892 --> 01:08:57,152
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

845
01:08:58,772 --> 01:09:25,207
[SPEAKER_14]: President Caraviello, I think it's important that we do, as a group, as a city council, understand what the immediate needs are, a five-year plan, and I think, that was my question in the beginning, and it's not really answered, and I have to review on this in depth, it does seem like everything is included, but when you stated that when the state comes in, you will let them know what the priorities are,

846
01:09:27,248 --> 01:09:37,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I would just request through the chair that we do get a top five, top 10 list of things that need to be done and maybe why they need to be done.

847
01:09:37,751 --> 01:09:45,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing extensive, just the first thing we would need is a, just so we could better understand what those 10 things are.

848
01:09:45,573 --> 01:09:53,395
[SPEAKER_14]: If the state is going to give us money, I think the city council, who will have to agree or disagree to bond for it,

849
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:57,432
[SPEAKER_14]: should know that up front before we submit something like this.

850
01:09:58,573 --> 01:09:59,734
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's number one.

851
01:09:59,774 --> 01:10:22,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Number two, I just agree with Councilor Marks in the respect with regards to putting everything in the kitchen sink into this document, because we were told that we can't afford a fire station until 2022, 23, 24, and the fire department was also promised to be almost the next on the list

852
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:36,243
[SPEAKER_14]: So the administration told us that we can't afford probably a number of these larger items unless it's, you know, obviously a substantial need like a leaking roof or a blown boiler.

853
01:10:36,903 --> 01:10:50,367
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would hate to have one of these larger projects that is not necessarily a necessity be approved and us be given a grant and then we come and see 500 students here advocating for

854
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:58,380
[SPEAKER_14]: that 500-person cafeteria or something that's almost a novelty that we can't afford and then have 75 firefighters in here.

855
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:04,942
[SPEAKER_14]: But wait, saying wait, we were promised a new station, a healthy, safe environment for us to work.

856
01:11:05,282 --> 01:11:07,403
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the way politics runs in Medford.

857
01:11:07,423 --> 01:11:10,824
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going to be up to all the elected body.

858
01:11:11,004 --> 01:11:15,326
[SPEAKER_14]: How it's worked is it's going to come before the council to take that tough vote.

859
01:11:15,846 --> 01:11:19,947
[SPEAKER_14]: So whether or not, I think this needs to be narrowed down just a bit.

860
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:21,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I understand both sides.

861
01:11:21,961 --> 01:11:26,002
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand you want to include everything your staff and administration wants in the document.

862
01:11:26,502 --> 01:11:27,602
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's a lie.

863
01:11:27,722 --> 01:11:29,583
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't afford all these items.

864
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:37,164
[SPEAKER_14]: And what we should be able to afford are the necessities, health, safety, and obviously the security within that school.

865
01:11:37,785 --> 01:11:39,725
[SPEAKER_14]: And that should be what's in this document.

866
01:11:39,765 --> 01:11:42,766
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what I'd be comfortable approving tonight.

867
01:11:43,126 --> 01:11:50,007
[SPEAKER_14]: And you would have my approval if it was narrowed down a little bit to maybe the top 10 items that need to be done at the high school.

868
01:11:50,489 --> 01:11:57,133
[SPEAKER_14]: and then we can do the necessities, do things that need to be done within the next five, six, seven years.

869
01:11:57,673 --> 01:12:19,787
[SPEAKER_14]: So I mean, I agree, and I think that's some, those are two points, two things maybe that I think we should have before us, maybe a little updated document, a little less extravagant, and then also just a top 10 list of what needs to be done, what we're gonna need to do within the next five to 10 years, so that we can say, yes,

870
01:12:20,622 --> 01:12:40,897
[SPEAKER_14]: good request, and then see what the state is willing to give us, because we cannot afford, we were told we cannot afford 10 extra million now, and we won't be able to afford it until we do the fire station, and then at that point, we won't be able to afford a library, and basically what I heard is we won't be able to afford a lot of these items in this document.

871
01:12:41,297 --> 01:12:48,683
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd rather ask for, hey, state, please, we need a roof, we need a new electrical system in A building,

872
01:12:49,093 --> 01:12:56,796
[SPEAKER_14]: These things are going to, obviously, we need them evaluated, and they're going to fall apart, or are going to have to be replaced within the next five to 10 years.

873
01:12:56,816 --> 01:13:15,124
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would ask the council to really think about that, because that's a situation we're going to face, or whoever's sitting behind this rail, four, five, three years from now, if we do get the monies for an extravagant item that we just really can't afford, that the kids are going to want so badly, and the administration's going to want.

874
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:18,085
[SPEAKER_14]: But will they need it, and will we be able to afford it?

875
01:13:18,486 --> 01:13:20,246
[SPEAKER_14]: And we were told, no, it's not going to happen.

876
01:13:20,286 --> 01:13:23,027
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's, I think we need to be a little bit more realistic.

877
01:13:25,367 --> 01:13:25,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

878
01:13:26,847 --> 01:13:28,248
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

879
01:13:28,268 --> 01:13:32,968
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're getting the cut way, way, way ahead of the horse here, Mr. President.

880
01:13:33,148 --> 01:13:39,069
[SPEAKER_05]: If we look at the history of the Medford City Council, just several weeks ago, we voted unanimously for the administration to hire a grant writer.

881
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:47,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Before us right here, we have a grant that's been written and an opportunity to let the school department go and explore options and opportunities for the city to be given free money.

882
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:51,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that's a bad thing, Mr. President.

883
01:13:52,154 --> 01:13:53,675
[SPEAKER_05]: We get elected to make tough decisions.

884
01:13:54,315 --> 01:14:06,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there comes a point in time when there's a room full of students and a room full of firefighters that are sitting here arguing about whose project is going to get funded, I think that everybody behind this rail is committed to the understanding that public safety is our first priority, Mr. President.

885
01:14:06,965 --> 01:14:08,926
[SPEAKER_05]: But we will be the ones that have to make that tough decision.

886
01:14:09,487 --> 01:14:10,307
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what we're here for.

887
01:14:12,369 --> 01:14:19,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, Mr. President, all this is, is the school district seeking permission to go and sit down and have a conversation.

888
01:14:20,302 --> 01:14:22,924
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what this is, the school district sitting down to have a conversation.

889
01:14:23,585 --> 01:14:25,807
[SPEAKER_05]: As such, Mr. President, I've made a motion to move for approval.

890
01:14:25,827 --> 01:14:27,108
[SPEAKER_05]: I make a motion to end all debate.

891
01:14:27,568 --> 01:14:28,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Move the question.

892
01:14:34,854 --> 01:14:36,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clark, could you read the amendment, please?

893
01:14:49,844 --> 01:14:52,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, motion to end all debate requires a two-thirds roll call vote.

894
01:14:54,185 --> 01:14:54,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Mox.

895
01:14:55,486 --> 01:14:58,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Thank you, Mr. President.

896
01:14:59,107 --> 01:15:00,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.

897
01:15:00,827 --> 01:15:01,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Non-debatable motion.

898
01:15:03,188 --> 01:15:04,748
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's up to Robert's Rules of Orders.

899
01:15:06,129 --> 01:15:07,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Why aren't we in the debate?

900
01:15:07,229 --> 01:15:09,029
[SPEAKER_08]: We just got the paper tonight.

901
01:15:09,049 --> 01:15:09,970
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the debate now?

902
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:12,670
[SPEAKER_08]: We just got the paper tonight.

903
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:13,211
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in the debate?

904
01:15:13,231 --> 01:15:17,932
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want to allow the school district to move forward and pursue whether or not they have an opportunity to receive free grant money?

905
01:15:18,268 --> 01:15:19,288
[SPEAKER_05]: based upon the history of the council.

906
01:15:19,308 --> 01:15:20,028
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're here discussing.

907
01:15:20,068 --> 01:15:22,029
[SPEAKER_05]: Voting in favor of hiring a grant writer.

908
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:23,229
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we're here discussing.

909
01:15:23,469 --> 01:15:24,670
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question is yes or no.

910
01:15:24,690 --> 01:15:26,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want him to go forward and apply or not?

911
01:15:27,150 --> 01:15:28,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you want to end debate?

912
01:15:28,851 --> 01:15:29,571
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are we going with this?

913
01:15:29,891 --> 01:15:30,391
[SPEAKER_05]: We're discussing it.

914
01:15:30,471 --> 01:15:31,972
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't seem to me like it's going anywhere.

915
01:15:32,012 --> 01:15:33,612
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't seem to me like it's going anywhere.

916
01:15:33,752 --> 01:15:34,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, maybe to you it doesn't.

917
01:15:35,553 --> 01:15:36,633
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of us have questions.

918
01:15:37,013 --> 01:15:38,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there's a motion on the floor.

919
01:15:38,173 --> 01:15:40,034
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an undebatable motion that requires a two thirds vote.

920
01:15:40,054 --> 01:15:40,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

921
01:15:41,034 --> 01:15:42,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, you want to stifle the people's speech again.

922
01:15:45,605 --> 01:15:45,745
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

923
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,746
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty sure three times in 10 minutes has been met.

924
01:15:47,766 --> 01:15:48,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

925
01:15:49,486 --> 01:15:49,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

926
01:15:51,767 --> 01:15:58,089
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the last question, the chair is just giving, I let you speak.

927
01:15:58,109 --> 01:15:58,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

928
01:15:58,609 --> 01:15:59,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I, or do I not have the chair?

929
01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:01,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the floor.

930
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:01,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

931
01:16:14,573 --> 01:16:15,574
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight is correct.

932
01:16:16,714 --> 01:16:17,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I call for it.

933
01:16:18,375 --> 01:16:25,599
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Knight to end all discussion, and it takes a two thirds vote, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

934
01:16:26,059 --> 01:16:32,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dello Russo.

935
01:16:32,763 --> 01:16:33,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

936
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:35,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

937
01:16:36,665 --> 01:16:36,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

938
01:16:39,267 --> 01:16:42,168
[SPEAKER_15]: I second the original motion, that is adopted.

939
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:44,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Layton.

940
01:16:44,573 --> 01:16:45,374
Yes.

941
01:16:45,815 --> 01:16:46,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello.

942
01:16:47,076 --> 01:16:47,336
No.

943
01:16:48,498 --> 01:16:49,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice-President Marks.

944
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:50,100
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

945
01:16:51,061 --> 01:16:51,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

946
01:16:51,922 --> 01:16:52,142
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

947
01:16:52,843 --> 01:16:53,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice-President Caraviello.

948
01:16:53,924 --> 01:16:56,327
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

949
01:16:56,347 --> 01:17:00,171
[SPEAKER_07]: Two in the affirmative, six in the negative, motion fails.

950
01:17:00,712 --> 01:17:02,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dello Russo has the floor.

951
01:17:02,838 --> 01:17:04,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I had the floor before that, Mr. President.

952
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:09,406
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Councilor Dullos, you... No, no, no, he said it was undebatable.

953
01:17:10,387 --> 01:17:11,268
[SPEAKER_08]: He said it was undebatable.

954
01:17:12,529 --> 01:17:14,571
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dullos, you had the floor when you were asking that question.

955
01:17:16,053 --> 01:17:16,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

956
01:17:17,034 --> 01:17:18,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Layton, do you have any more to add?

957
01:17:18,636 --> 01:17:19,637
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my motion, Mr. President.

958
01:17:19,657 --> 01:17:20,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

959
01:17:20,458 --> 01:17:21,059
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion fails.

960
01:17:21,699 --> 01:17:22,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks, do you want to add anything?

961
01:17:23,413 --> 01:17:25,414
[SPEAKER_08]: I do, mister, I have a question for the superintendent.

962
01:17:25,434 --> 01:17:25,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Speak.

963
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:26,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we here tonight?

964
01:17:26,474 --> 01:17:26,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Speak.

965
01:17:26,974 --> 01:17:30,076
[SPEAKER_08]: To discuss, the superintendent came up here, took his time out of his busy schedule.

966
01:17:30,096 --> 01:17:32,437
[SPEAKER_08]: No one's denying you an opportunity to speak.

967
01:17:32,917 --> 01:17:34,458
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just trying to deny freedom of speech.

968
01:17:34,478 --> 01:17:35,578
[SPEAKER_08]: I was not trying to deny you.

969
01:17:35,978 --> 01:17:39,099
[SPEAKER_07]: The people, the board spoke, and you were able to speak.

970
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:44,422
[SPEAKER_08]: The board spoke is right, and I'm thankful for my colleagues that know what this legislative process is all about.

971
01:17:44,722 --> 01:17:45,922
[SPEAKER_08]: You have the floor, Vice President.

972
01:17:46,042 --> 01:17:47,743
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I do, thank you, keep them interrupting.

973
01:17:50,304 --> 01:17:52,325
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanna thank my colleagues,

974
01:17:53,197 --> 01:17:58,780
[SPEAKER_08]: that had the gumption, Mr. President, to allow this dialogue to keep going on and not be rubber stamps.

975
01:18:02,882 --> 01:18:10,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent, are you willing to put together a priority list, as Councilor Wendell Kern mentioned, in the SOI?

976
01:18:10,446 --> 01:18:14,448
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems like this is an ongoing, fluid discussion with the state.

977
01:18:14,508 --> 01:18:15,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you willing to do that?

978
01:18:16,469 --> 01:18:18,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that the school committee

979
01:18:18,847 --> 01:18:20,287
[SPEAKER_09]: would meet to talk about that.

980
01:18:20,467 --> 01:18:25,068
[SPEAKER_09]: And we could sit together, because I'm not going to speak solely for them.

981
01:18:25,408 --> 01:18:29,669
[SPEAKER_09]: They have a right to determine what they would consider priorities within this list.

982
01:18:30,389 --> 01:18:31,949
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're not going to meet for another two weeks.

983
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:34,810
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I think that that slows this down.

984
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:38,611
[SPEAKER_09]: This is due in a very short period of time into the state.

985
01:18:38,671 --> 01:18:42,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that we can always send you a priority list afterwards.

986
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:45,892
[SPEAKER_09]: But the things we would prioritize in our discussions with the state.

987
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:50,709
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think you should allow us to go forward and to get this going.

988
01:18:50,749 --> 01:18:51,709
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it doesn't hurt.

989
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:54,731
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not committing anything in terms of money.

990
01:18:55,351 --> 01:19:04,555
[SPEAKER_09]: You're just allowing us to submit an application to the state so that we can be heard with their team that evaluates issues.

991
01:19:04,915 --> 01:19:07,996
[SPEAKER_09]: And they won't even get to us for a couple of months, I'm sure.

992
01:19:08,697 --> 01:19:10,938
[SPEAKER_09]: They won't even get to us for a short period of time.

993
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:13,559
[SPEAKER_09]: But having said that, we have to be in.

994
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:15,760
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there are other communities going to submit as well.

995
01:19:16,742 --> 01:19:19,804
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we're not in, we don't get any consideration.

996
01:19:20,185 --> 01:19:27,410
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think I'll be happy to bring that up with the school committee to give you some sort of what they consider priorities within this list.

997
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:29,771
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't think you should stop it tonight.

998
01:19:31,012 --> 01:19:32,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Superintendent, if I could.

999
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:37,997
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think anyone behind this reeling, and I'll speak for myself, was looking to stop this tonight.

1000
01:19:38,658 --> 01:19:41,040
[SPEAKER_08]: We were looking to ask questions, Mr. Superintendent.

1001
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:45,603
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's not confused questioning with being in opposition.

1002
01:19:46,347 --> 01:19:47,448
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part of the process.

1003
01:19:48,509 --> 01:19:49,449
[SPEAKER_08]: It's part of the process.

1004
01:19:49,469 --> 01:19:54,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this is an early step, and it's the first step, and now we're hearing April 7th is the deadline.

1005
01:19:54,934 --> 01:20:01,379
[SPEAKER_08]: No surprise, not for you, but no surprise to this council, because we're always presented with, oh, the deadline's next week.

1006
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:02,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Make a decision.

1007
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:05,642
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't table it for a week, because the deadline's next week.

1008
01:20:06,523 --> 01:20:08,184
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're always presented that way.

1009
01:20:08,524 --> 01:20:11,687
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm not going to stand in the way of this tonight, Mr. Superintendent.

1010
01:20:11,947 --> 01:20:13,548
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what Councilor Lungo-Koehn offered

1011
01:20:13,907 --> 01:20:21,493
[SPEAKER_08]: about going back, and if you need to go back to the school committee and get a priority list, I think that's a great suggestion, Mr. Superintendent, to do that.

1012
01:20:22,053 --> 01:20:23,415
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would ask that that be done.

1013
01:20:24,035 --> 01:20:37,866
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would also ask that this council be privy to any discussions that you are having with the state regarding projects, of which projects may be taken off the board, which projects may be added to the SOI.

1014
01:20:38,613 --> 01:20:43,858
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're up to date and not just presented something on the last hour again for approval.

1015
01:20:44,538 --> 01:20:49,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would ask that you keep this council privy to that information, Mr. President.

1016
01:20:50,143 --> 01:20:51,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly have no problem with any of that.

1017
01:20:51,965 --> 01:20:54,047
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, look, let's not kid ourselves.

1018
01:20:54,607 --> 01:21:00,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Any project to go forward needs a school committee, needs the mayor, needs the city council, and needs the state.

1019
01:21:01,792 --> 01:21:07,017
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of deliberation that's going to have to take place and a lot of prioritization that's going to take place.

1020
01:21:07,357 --> 01:21:13,983
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're only asking me to go back to the school committee and sit down and ask them to tell you what's most important to them, happy to do that.

1021
01:21:14,463 --> 01:21:16,345
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that's a good thing.

1022
01:21:16,845 --> 01:21:19,307
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't think we should stop getting in on the

1023
01:21:22,215 --> 01:21:27,036
[SPEAKER_09]: into the state with this so we can continue to move and get them to come out to us sooner rather than later.

1024
01:21:27,096 --> 01:21:29,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Because everybody's going to be submitting.

1025
01:21:29,576 --> 01:21:36,337
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we're the last one in the door, maybe our review date doesn't happen until August, September, October, whatever the case may be.

1026
01:21:38,298 --> 01:21:42,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I was told, just so you know, there's no priority according to when the SOI is received.

1027
01:21:42,899 --> 01:21:51,140
[SPEAKER_08]: So whether the last one in the door, first one in the door, second one in the door, I was also told that they're not going to look at applications or make any recommendations until December.

1028
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:58,801
[SPEAKER_08]: of 2017, so there's plenty of time, and I'm just asking that we be part of any discussions that are ongoing.

1029
01:21:59,482 --> 01:22:02,327
[SPEAKER_08]: You will have my support here tonight, Mr. Superintendent.

1030
01:22:02,971 --> 01:22:21,139
[SPEAKER_08]: I could just tell you eventually, and as a longtime member of this council, eventually when something comes before us, whether it's a year, two or three years before us, and if it does, if and when it does require, maybe require a proposition two and a half override, you will not have my support.

1031
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:26,862
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to let that be known right now because I'm not going to hold back any punches.

1032
01:22:27,914 --> 01:22:37,198
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I voted not to have the combined center because we were told that it would require a proposition two and a half override for the police and fire.

1033
01:22:38,058 --> 01:22:43,580
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we have a library coming down the pike pretty soon with some grant funding.

1034
01:22:43,921 --> 01:22:47,602
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have this project, and eventually we're going to have the fire department coming down.

1035
01:22:47,662 --> 01:22:57,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would just ask that whatever's done, that it stay within the confines of our budget without a proposition two and a half override.

1036
01:22:57,693 --> 01:23:01,735
[SPEAKER_09]: I respect your right to make those decisions, and, you know, I understand them.

1037
01:23:01,975 --> 01:23:03,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'm not a rookie.

1038
01:23:03,736 --> 01:23:10,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been here a long time, and I've been in and out of these meetings many times, asking for funding and other forms of support.

1039
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,220
[SPEAKER_09]: So I respect that.

1040
01:23:13,181 --> 01:23:16,943
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's important that you know your options, and that's all I'm asking you to know.

1041
01:23:16,983 --> 01:23:17,723
[SPEAKER_09]: Know your options.

1042
01:23:19,944 --> 01:23:20,244
Thank you.

1043
01:23:20,625 --> 01:23:21,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Counsel Max, are you finished?

1044
01:23:21,745 --> 01:23:22,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1045
01:23:23,686 --> 01:23:24,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Counsel De La Rosa.

1046
01:23:25,947 --> 01:23:27,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1047
01:23:28,155 --> 01:23:33,017
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, Mr. Superintendent, for your leadership and your clarity and your foresight.

1048
01:23:34,457 --> 01:23:46,921
[SPEAKER_03]: The way I understand this request, it is to get us, as you've presented, into the door and to have items for discussion on the table for us to see what can be funded and what we can receive help with.

1049
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:52,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all in favor of a priority list from the school board.

1050
01:23:53,304 --> 01:23:57,445
[SPEAKER_03]: My concern with priority lists from anybody is that they be responsible.

1051
01:23:58,203 --> 01:24:10,688
[SPEAKER_03]: and that they have in mind a larger picture that though this body makes the final decision that we all share a responsibility in.

1052
01:24:12,248 --> 01:24:16,810
[SPEAKER_03]: I approve of this request and I will support it, Mr. Superintendent.

1053
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:23,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I must say that I hope that when we get into further discussion on how or

1054
01:24:24,133 --> 01:24:38,297
[SPEAKER_03]: in what way some of this money and some of these grants might be directed, that we're able to address some of the money that we've spent in the past on the same thing several times.

1055
01:24:39,837 --> 01:24:49,560
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems as though we're chasing leaks in those roofs and replacing them and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on those roofs in a frequent manner.

1056
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:54,723
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm concerned about that, and I hope we can get to the bottom of the top of the building.

1057
01:24:55,544 --> 01:25:00,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think I've said enough, and I think perhaps we've heard enough tonight.

1058
01:25:01,589 --> 01:25:04,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'd like to move approval, Mr. President.

1059
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:05,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1060
01:25:05,652 --> 01:25:08,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, just one quick thing to counsel, if I may.

1061
01:25:09,194 --> 01:25:11,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Just that we did an infrared study of the high school roof.

1062
01:25:12,757 --> 01:25:17,420
[SPEAKER_09]: We will repair those things that need to be repaired for about $25,000 this summer.

1063
01:25:18,201 --> 01:25:19,502
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, that's about all we need to do.

1064
01:25:20,179 --> 01:25:26,724
[SPEAKER_09]: The long-term renovation or repair or reconstruction of the roof is five to six years out.

1065
01:25:27,365 --> 01:25:29,647
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, if we were to take it to the end.

1066
01:25:29,747 --> 01:25:31,228
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's really where we're at.

1067
01:25:31,908 --> 01:25:43,618
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a couple of very difficult snow periods a few years ago where shoveling was required on the roof to avoid collapse and the like that may have done some damage in certain areas, and we need to repair those.

1068
01:25:43,658 --> 01:25:45,940
[SPEAKER_09]: But other than that, the roof's got another five, six years.

1069
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:48,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1070
01:25:48,081 --> 01:25:48,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1071
01:25:49,943 --> 01:25:52,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Caraviello, through the chair, I just want to ask for clarification.

1072
01:25:52,885 --> 01:25:58,489
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're asking for a priority list and we're asking, I mean, I guess it would be a good compromise.

1073
01:25:58,569 --> 01:26:03,552
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we asking to keep the document as is and then put the priority list in there?

1074
01:26:03,672 --> 01:26:04,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you state that, Councilor Marks?

1075
01:26:05,434 --> 01:26:07,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Put the priority list within the application?

1076
01:26:12,578 --> 01:26:14,720
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought I heard you say that it will be within the document.

1077
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:22,447
[SPEAKER_08]: We could put in the document, or the superintendent says he sits down and meets with the state, so I have no problem with him presenting the priority list.

1078
01:26:23,548 --> 01:26:27,189
[SPEAKER_08]: So it doesn't, I don't care about the avenue it gets to the state.

1079
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:43,954
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, yeah, I just would like to add that, that our priority list that is drafted within the next week or two, even be added as an attachment to the application, so that the state knows, yes, we're looking for everything, but these are our top,

1080
01:26:44,678 --> 01:26:51,722
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever it might be, 10, 11, 12 things that we need done within the next five to 10 years that we're going to be putting money forward anyway for.

1081
01:26:51,742 --> 01:26:55,264
[SPEAKER_14]: And we would love some state reimbursement.

1082
01:26:55,404 --> 01:26:57,485
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that I'd just like to add that to the paper.

1083
01:26:58,265 --> 01:27:03,388
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd also like to just point out that I think I heard that this document maybe was produced in September.

1084
01:27:03,888 --> 01:27:08,851
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think the school committee voted on it on the 6th of February, which was a month and a half ago.

1085
01:27:08,871 --> 01:27:14,074
[SPEAKER_14]: And for some reason, it came before us tonight with only a week or two left before it's actually due.

1086
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:25,120
[SPEAKER_14]: So in the future, it would be nice to, obviously the school committee has the right to review and to discuss first, but a little bit sooner so that maybe we could prepare a little bit more.

1087
01:27:25,140 --> 01:27:26,181
[SPEAKER_14]: We got it on Friday.

1088
01:27:26,201 --> 01:27:35,624
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a lot of us review our packet over the weekend, leaving us only a couple days to form questions, do research, make calls, and get the questions we want answered before we have to vote on it.

1089
01:27:35,685 --> 01:27:44,108
[SPEAKER_14]: And it always just feels, not just, no offense to the superintendent, but no matter what we're presented, half the time, especially if it's something important, we're giving it

1090
01:27:44,689 --> 01:28:00,500
[SPEAKER_14]: the week of and it's just not the right way to run a city and to be transparent with not only us as the people who are elected to make the votes, but to the people who are electing us who are going to come and ask us the questions or who asks us the questions after they hear the meeting.

1091
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:13,689
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think just think in the future and I'll say that all the time and whether or not it happens, highly unlikely, but I think it's extremely important to be more transparent and to give the city council more time for review.

1092
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:14,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1093
01:28:14,588 --> 01:28:16,629
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mr. President, if I could just respond.

1094
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:18,070
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I feel I have to.

1095
01:28:18,611 --> 01:28:21,412
[SPEAKER_09]: The document you're referring to in September was a different document.

1096
01:28:21,532 --> 01:28:24,994
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the capital plan that came from the mayor through the school committee.

1097
01:28:25,315 --> 01:28:34,500
[SPEAKER_09]: The document you have in front of you was approved by the school committee on February 6th after a committee of the whole meeting that they had the week before on that.

1098
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:37,362
[SPEAKER_09]: And you received it, what do you call it, tonight.

1099
01:28:38,879 --> 01:28:46,890
[SPEAKER_09]: because, what do you call it, you were busy dealing with other capital considerations, in particular the police station and other things like that, so they confused those two items.

1100
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:50,274
[SPEAKER_09]: But the reality is that that's the two things.

1101
01:28:50,315 --> 01:28:54,260
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other point I guess I would make is that the state has a form.

1102
01:28:54,731 --> 01:28:55,772
[SPEAKER_09]: We filled out the form.

1103
01:28:56,132 --> 01:28:57,934
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't add to the form.

1104
01:28:57,994 --> 01:29:02,638
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll be happy to provide that priority list to them, but the form is the form.

1105
01:29:02,678 --> 01:29:03,538
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you submit.

1106
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:07,321
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't add things to an application that is not required.

1107
01:29:07,782 --> 01:29:14,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that would be not consistent with the way you make a submittal.

1108
01:29:15,388 --> 01:29:23,775
[SPEAKER_09]: But certainly, we respect the right that the council has asked, and we certainly will honor that, to come up with a priority list, provide it to you, and provide it to MSBA,

1109
01:29:24,367 --> 01:29:26,228
[SPEAKER_09]: as part of the discussions that take place.

1110
01:29:26,888 --> 01:29:27,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1111
01:29:27,288 --> 01:29:28,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1112
01:29:28,548 --> 01:29:40,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I would, uh, my point was to be, uh, in support of that priority list attachment in so much as it, uh, it doesn't act as a hindrance or as an appropriate in that forum.

1113
01:29:41,172 --> 01:29:53,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I, uh, trust that the superintendent, uh, through the process of meetings, uh, with the authority and, uh, his presence and his negotiating skills won't lead us to be bamboozled.

1114
01:29:55,019 --> 01:29:56,420
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor DelaRosso.

1115
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:59,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. Superintendent, I thank you for your leadership.

1116
01:29:59,602 --> 01:30:05,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Our technical school and high school has moved forward in the last few years under your guidance, and I hope to see it continue moving forward.

1117
01:30:05,706 --> 01:30:06,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1118
01:30:06,206 --> 01:30:06,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1119
01:30:07,207 --> 01:30:09,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have somebody that wants to speak in back here.

1120
01:30:09,668 --> 01:30:09,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1121
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:14,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, Mr. Penta, the gentleman was first.

1122
01:30:18,574 --> 01:30:19,614
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address of the record, please.

1123
01:30:20,115 --> 01:30:21,856
[SPEAKER_18]: David McKillop, 94 Rock Glen Road.

1124
01:30:22,996 --> 01:30:23,737
[SPEAKER_18]: I was listening to

1125
01:30:24,473 --> 01:30:30,458
[SPEAKER_18]: all the conversation tonight, and I guess being a business person, I'm all about planning.

1126
01:30:31,139 --> 01:30:34,281
[SPEAKER_18]: It seems to be that for whatever reason, we're struggling with planning.

1127
01:30:35,302 --> 01:30:38,685
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the things that really strikes me as curious is the MSBA.

1128
01:30:40,126 --> 01:30:41,507
[SPEAKER_18]: The MSBA was presented.

1129
01:30:41,848 --> 01:30:45,691
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, when it was presented is the question, because if it was presented

1130
01:30:46,511 --> 01:30:53,455
[SPEAKER_18]: Two months ago, six months ago, a year ago, then you may have had the opportunity to actually get more information a lot sooner.

1131
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:55,076
[SPEAKER_18]: So that should be a question that should be asked.

1132
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:59,979
[SPEAKER_18]: When is the MSBA turn around and say, hey, when does the door open?

1133
01:31:00,939 --> 01:31:03,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Subbotin, can you answer the gentleman's question?

1134
01:31:05,282 --> 01:31:12,266
[SPEAKER_09]: The MSBA opens up a window for statements of interest in January and then expects it to

1135
01:31:13,206 --> 01:31:15,189
[SPEAKER_09]: follow through by the April date.

1136
01:31:15,569 --> 01:31:17,111
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually pushed it out a little bit this year.

1137
01:31:17,151 --> 01:31:21,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Normally it's in March, but they open up the window for the SOIs in January.

1138
01:31:21,737 --> 01:31:22,358
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, thank you.

1139
01:31:22,679 --> 01:31:23,600
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's the first thing.

1140
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:33,762
[SPEAKER_18]: So if it's being opened up in January, the meeting is being done in February, the finalization is then, now it's March, April, really the window is much, much smaller than you might actually anticipate.

1141
01:31:33,802 --> 01:31:36,843
[SPEAKER_18]: So the question isn't answered in the respect of how to plan this better.

1142
01:31:37,323 --> 01:31:45,465
[SPEAKER_18]: So now, to be proactive, the next time the MSBA opens up, I think as a city council, I personally, if it were me,

1143
01:31:46,113 --> 01:31:52,797
[SPEAKER_18]: would say, hey, the next time this opens, we want from day one to know when and how and what we need to do.

1144
01:31:53,157 --> 01:31:54,197
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to be part of that.

1145
01:31:54,638 --> 01:32:02,642
[SPEAKER_18]: So when the school committee goes into the committee of the whole, the discussion is made, you're already aware something's going to be coming to your desk.

1146
01:32:02,702 --> 01:32:03,602
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that would help.

1147
01:32:04,443 --> 01:32:10,906
[SPEAKER_18]: To me, again, looking at a business perspective, I've been in business for 14 years.

1148
01:32:12,212 --> 01:32:14,713
[SPEAKER_18]: My business needs a facelift really, really bad.

1149
01:32:14,954 --> 01:32:17,115
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you guys want to help me with that, please contribute.

1150
01:32:17,995 --> 01:32:23,838
[SPEAKER_18]: But in order to do that, four years ago, I had to start planning for this coming year, not 2017, 2018.

1151
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:28,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Four years ago, I started to put that plan together.

1152
01:32:28,461 --> 01:32:30,582
[SPEAKER_18]: Four years ago, I did a cost analysis.

1153
01:32:30,682 --> 01:32:35,785
[SPEAKER_18]: Four years ago, we started to meet with people that could help us put this project together.

1154
01:32:36,145 --> 01:32:40,331
[SPEAKER_18]: This year we're meeting with a designer who's going to take an entire year to put this together.

1155
01:32:40,892 --> 01:32:49,785
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't understand how we're looking at the police station, the fire station, the high school, and we're saying, oh my God.

1156
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:56,013
[SPEAKER_18]: The world is coming to an end today when this has been happening for 10, 15, 20, 30 years.

1157
01:32:56,734 --> 01:33:00,016
[SPEAKER_18]: So the other thing I ask is, where's the plan?

1158
01:33:00,856 --> 01:33:04,459
[SPEAKER_18]: We just heard that it would be five years out for a new roof.

1159
01:33:04,999 --> 01:33:05,599
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's the plan?

1160
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,681
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we have a plan in front of us?

1161
01:33:08,381 --> 01:33:10,302
[SPEAKER_18]: Do we know how much it's gonna cost in five years?

1162
01:33:10,462 --> 01:33:12,323
[SPEAKER_18]: Have we started to map that out?

1163
01:33:12,944 --> 01:33:14,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we planning for that?

1164
01:33:15,505 --> 01:33:19,688
[SPEAKER_18]: Secondly is, if we're going to get 40 more years out of this high school,

1165
01:33:21,143 --> 01:33:21,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1166
01:33:22,403 --> 01:33:23,824
[SPEAKER_18]: What's the plan in 40 years?

1167
01:33:24,484 --> 01:33:25,485
[SPEAKER_18]: What's the new high school?

1168
01:33:26,025 --> 01:33:34,728
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's be visionaries and let's try to figure out how we can make this happen in the future for all of the people that are voting for you and all the people in this community.

1169
01:33:34,768 --> 01:33:37,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I look at Medford as a gateway city.

1170
01:33:37,689 --> 01:33:38,709
[SPEAKER_18]: Cambridge is maxed out.

1171
01:33:39,150 --> 01:33:40,110
[SPEAKER_18]: Somerville's maxed out.

1172
01:33:40,510 --> 01:33:41,911
[SPEAKER_18]: This is the next city on the line.

1173
01:33:42,751 --> 01:33:46,032
[SPEAKER_18]: You want it to be Medford or do you want it to be Malden or do you want it to be Everett?

1174
01:33:46,618 --> 01:33:55,600
[SPEAKER_18]: I think you guys really have to take a look at that and start planning ahead and putting your best foot forward, because if you don't start investing now, it's going to catch up later on.

1175
01:33:56,420 --> 01:33:56,721
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1176
01:33:57,741 --> 01:33:58,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1177
01:34:02,022 --> 01:34:03,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

1178
01:34:03,502 --> 01:34:07,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Robert Penter, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this board.

1179
01:34:07,803 --> 01:34:11,324
[SPEAKER_17]: With all due respect to the superintendent, I appreciate the fact that he was here.

1180
01:34:11,864 --> 01:34:14,645
[SPEAKER_17]: Knowing that in January that the application is out there,

1181
01:34:15,078 --> 01:34:23,144
[SPEAKER_17]: And knowing that the school committee met, I believe, a week before February 6th, it really doesn't give much time, whether it be for the school committee or even before the city council.

1182
01:34:23,504 --> 01:34:30,069
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, and this is something I believe, Mr. President, that you should have been advised of in a joint meeting between the school committee and the city council.

1183
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:40,046
[SPEAKER_17]: While the council may have a lot of priorities and financial obligations to meet, that should be not an excuse or a red herring to say that's the reason why they didn't sit down or bring this out sooner.

1184
01:34:40,387 --> 01:34:42,528
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not right, it's not fair, it doesn't make any sense.

1185
01:34:43,048 --> 01:34:46,150
[SPEAKER_17]: The job is here to deal with everything that this city involves you with.

1186
01:34:46,651 --> 01:34:48,572
[SPEAKER_17]: Finances, education, whatever it might be.

1187
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:52,154
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you have to meet more than one night a week, wow, what a shame that would be.

1188
01:34:52,735 --> 01:35:00,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe if you met three or four times a week and you made the mayor become involved in all of this and make you to become involved with this, you'd have a better handle on what's going on.

1189
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:16,490
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Superintendent, you state on your document that you are submitting, you state, the school which is structurally unsound or otherwise in a condition seriously jeopardizing the health and safety of school children where no alternatives exist.

1190
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:32,798
[SPEAKER_17]: You go on further to state that the renovation that took place in 2013 regarding the science labs for which the Medford City Council discussed on more than one night, I believe it was four times, and as a result of that, part of that was because of recertification with the Commonwealth of Mass.

1191
01:35:33,438 --> 01:35:43,343
[SPEAKER_17]: And further, the fact of the matter is that the building has not since then been renovated to meet ADA compliance standards and fire code standards that are needed to be current.

1192
01:35:44,169 --> 01:35:51,155
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, how can our city allow that building right now not to go forward and have those requirements met?

1193
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:56,419
[SPEAKER_17]: That should be something that the school committee addresses on an annual basis.

1194
01:35:56,980 --> 01:35:57,860
[SPEAKER_17]: That's an everyday thing.

1195
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:00,403
[SPEAKER_17]: You're talking about the safety of the children in the school.

1196
01:36:01,463 --> 01:36:07,248
[SPEAKER_17]: You indicate at that point in time, you indicate that the fire code would be approximately $1,200,000 to do an upgrade on that.

1197
01:36:07,288 --> 01:36:07,689
[SPEAKER_17]: You also indicated

1198
01:36:11,942 --> 01:36:15,102
[SPEAKER_17]: that there is no way to close off the sections of the building.

1199
01:36:15,543 --> 01:36:19,545
[SPEAKER_17]: to prevent citizens to enter restricted areas during non-school hours.

1200
01:36:19,565 --> 01:36:30,031
[SPEAKER_17]: You can go back to 1991, when I was sitting up there as president of the council, and that was an issue that was presented to us as it relates to out-of-towners coming to Medford High School that were not certified to be there.

1201
01:36:30,411 --> 01:36:37,255
[SPEAKER_17]: And in 2012, it was Councilman Marks who brought up the issue regarding the community schools on people coming in and out of the buildings.

1202
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:43,118
[SPEAKER_17]: And now you're talking about maybe having a program that cuts down the entrances, where and how you can get in?

1203
01:36:44,103 --> 01:36:52,408
[SPEAKER_17]: You can walk up to that high school right now at any point in time, after hours, and walk into that building, and there's nobody there to check you in or to check you out.

1204
01:36:52,448 --> 01:36:53,208
[SPEAKER_17]: It's totally unfair.

1205
01:36:53,228 --> 01:36:53,869
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not right.

1206
01:36:54,929 --> 01:37:10,559
[SPEAKER_17]: I can appreciate the fact that you might want to do all of these things now, but I beg the question, where has the school committee been on each and every one of these budgets, on each and every one of these years, especially on ADA compliance, especially on fire code compliance?

1207
01:37:11,950 --> 01:37:15,953
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the thing that's necessary each and every day, that a child goes to school.

1208
01:37:16,253 --> 01:37:17,754
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what you pay your taxes for.

1209
01:37:17,974 --> 01:37:21,016
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what a parent believes their elected officials are doing.

1210
01:37:21,056 --> 01:37:26,000
[SPEAKER_17]: They're making sure and ensuring that their children are protected when they go to school each and every day.

1211
01:37:28,423 --> 01:37:38,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Belson further stated, with all due respect, that in next year's budget he's going to put a dollar amount in there for school renovations or school upgradings, whatever it might be.

1212
01:37:39,373 --> 01:37:40,934
[SPEAKER_17]: We've been talking about this thing for years.

1213
01:37:41,555 --> 01:37:50,442
[SPEAKER_17]: The new school building program had a 5% annual charge that the city was supposed to put in each and every one of those new buildings to maintain themselves.

1214
01:37:51,204 --> 01:37:54,567
[SPEAKER_17]: And now, Councilor Caraviello, Mr. President, it's well over a million dollars.

1215
01:37:54,607 --> 01:37:57,309
[SPEAKER_17]: The buildings are less than, they're going on 14 to 15 years.

1216
01:37:57,549 --> 01:38:03,454
[SPEAKER_17]: We're right back to where you were in the beginning as the reason why you had to build new schools, because the maintenance didn't take place.

1217
01:38:04,335 --> 01:38:06,197
[SPEAKER_17]: Granted, Medford High School is a big school.

1218
01:38:06,337 --> 01:38:07,618
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a big school to take place.

1219
01:38:08,739 --> 01:38:15,484
[SPEAKER_17]: But you've got three roofs, three brand new roofs on that building, and now you're looking at a fourth one.

1220
01:38:15,925 --> 01:38:19,568
[SPEAKER_17]: The question then becomes, is the quality of the work not right?

1221
01:38:21,053 --> 01:38:24,335
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we not checking out to make sure that the quality of the work is not right?

1222
01:38:24,735 --> 01:38:27,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we just paying to have something done?

1223
01:38:29,297 --> 01:38:41,002
[SPEAKER_17]: Another part that I really think that needs to take place to be discussed is the fact that, you know, this is such an important issue because this isn't a million dollars or two million dollars.

1224
01:38:41,342 --> 01:38:44,424
[SPEAKER_17]: This is well in excess of your $10 million, Councilor Marks.

1225
01:38:45,144 --> 01:38:47,165
[SPEAKER_17]: The school committee should be here sitting with you

1226
01:38:48,478 --> 01:38:55,343
[SPEAKER_17]: And you, Mr. President, I would hope you would call for a joint meeting between the school committee to consider as you go forward on this particular project.

1227
01:38:56,584 --> 01:38:58,425
[SPEAKER_17]: You people got hit with this cold turkey tonight.

1228
01:38:58,705 --> 01:39:01,907
[SPEAKER_17]: You should have been called ahead of time to have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss it.

1229
01:39:02,628 --> 01:39:05,610
[SPEAKER_17]: It's before the bodies, before the public here tonight.

1230
01:39:06,871 --> 01:39:12,135
[SPEAKER_17]: And to shut off debate on millions of dollars being discussed is wrong.

1231
01:39:12,575 --> 01:39:13,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Debate was not shut off.

1232
01:39:15,377 --> 01:39:16,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1233
01:39:17,564 --> 01:39:30,920
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not relative to millions and millions of dollars, it's relative to whether or not we're going to authorize the school district to sit down and meet with the Massachusetts School Building Assistance Program to determine whether or not there are any grant funding opportunities that are competitive in nature for the city of Medford to pursue.

1234
01:39:31,779 --> 01:39:35,761
[SPEAKER_17]: And if that be the case, that's a dollar amount attached to it.

1235
01:39:35,961 --> 01:39:41,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Because the application before the school building assistance program, no matter what they allow, is going to have a dollar amount attached to it.

1236
01:39:41,724 --> 01:39:48,167
[SPEAKER_17]: That dollar amount has to be paid for by the city as to what portion of it they're going to accept, if not all of it or part of it.

1237
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:49,408
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a dollar amount.

1238
01:39:50,108 --> 01:39:53,470
[SPEAKER_17]: You should never shut off anybody, colleague or citizen, at the podium.

1239
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:55,051
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the only place you have an opportunity.

1240
01:39:55,071 --> 01:39:55,711
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody was shut off.

1241
01:39:56,091 --> 01:39:58,233
[SPEAKER_17]: I just said you should not shut off anyone.

1242
01:39:58,573 --> 01:40:00,314
[SPEAKER_17]: There was an attempt to end debate.

1243
01:40:00,334 --> 01:40:01,434
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody was shut off.

1244
01:40:01,454 --> 01:40:03,916
[SPEAKER_17]: I said there was an attempt to end debate, Mr. President.

1245
01:40:03,936 --> 01:40:04,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

1246
01:40:04,356 --> 01:40:05,617
[SPEAKER_05]: One information, Councilor Knight.

1247
01:40:05,977 --> 01:40:11,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Robert's Rules of Order have been adopted by the City Council as a standard to be used in the deliberation and discussion in the governing of our meetings.

1248
01:40:12,641 --> 01:40:14,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Section 18 of Robert's Rules of Order was raised.

1249
01:40:14,542 --> 01:40:14,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1250
01:40:14,762 --> 01:40:16,263
[SPEAKER_05]: Section of 18 of Robert's Rules of Order failed.

1251
01:40:16,503 --> 01:40:16,983
[SPEAKER_05]: No big deal.

1252
01:40:17,143 --> 01:40:17,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1253
01:40:17,904 --> 01:40:19,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Robert's Rules of Order also allows

1254
01:40:20,258 --> 01:40:21,738
[SPEAKER_17]: Public participation, Mr. President.

1255
01:40:21,758 --> 01:40:23,319
[SPEAKER_17]: Public participation is allowed.

1256
01:40:23,579 --> 01:40:24,699
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't want to hear it again.

1257
01:40:25,979 --> 01:40:27,019
[SPEAKER_17]: What is that, a threat?

1258
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a threat, Mr. President?

1259
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:31,020
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a right to say what I want.

1260
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:35,081
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a public forum, and I have a right to say what I want.

1261
01:40:35,481 --> 01:40:36,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1262
01:40:36,941 --> 01:40:37,461
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President.

1263
01:40:41,142 --> 01:40:42,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1264
01:40:42,182 --> 01:40:44,083
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a meeting of the Medford City Council.

1265
01:40:44,563 --> 01:40:44,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1266
01:40:45,787 --> 01:40:51,731
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, Mr. Belson also alluded to the fact that, and he's probably right in part, but he says we need to be partners with the state.

1267
01:40:52,252 --> 01:40:57,676
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to be partners between and amongst ourselves, council, school committee people, to get the best of ideas that need to go forward.

1268
01:40:58,116 --> 01:41:04,300
[SPEAKER_17]: I can appreciate the fact that he wants to submit something now and you can't change it because the form is there, but it's been hanging around since January of this year.

1269
01:41:04,721 --> 01:41:06,642
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the sad part, since January of this year.

1270
01:41:07,244 --> 01:41:10,166
[SPEAKER_17]: School committee allegedly only met once, if I understand that correctly.

1271
01:41:10,547 --> 01:41:14,610
[SPEAKER_17]: And if that be the case to discuss it, they probably didn't have the same opportunities, and I don't know.

1272
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:17,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe the superintendent presented what he thought the priorities might be.

1273
01:41:17,632 --> 01:41:18,032
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1274
01:41:18,453 --> 01:41:20,334
[SPEAKER_17]: None of us know, because we haven't had that opportunity.

1275
01:41:20,975 --> 01:41:26,259
[SPEAKER_17]: That's why not having joint meetings with our other legislative body hurts the process that's before you.

1276
01:41:26,899 --> 01:41:30,901
[SPEAKER_17]: It hurts the idea that you can get a better idea as to why and how it's going on.

1277
01:41:31,201 --> 01:41:33,222
[SPEAKER_17]: You get a better idea what the cost is going to be.

1278
01:41:33,402 --> 01:41:35,542
[SPEAKER_17]: You can get a better idea what the priorities are going to be.

1279
01:41:35,602 --> 01:41:41,725
[SPEAKER_17]: As the gentleman just came up here, Mr. McAuliffe, as he relates to the fact of how he has to run his business and what he has to plan for.

1280
01:41:43,266 --> 01:41:50,657
[SPEAKER_17]: No matter what the outcome is of this, whether they give you $1 million, $5 million, or $6 million, worthy, worthy of work to be done.

1281
01:41:50,957 --> 01:41:57,948
[SPEAKER_17]: You still have no priority program as it relates to any comprehensive financial program as to where this city is going.

1282
01:41:58,288 --> 01:42:01,630
[SPEAKER_17]: Police, fire, retirement board that needs to be paid.

1283
01:42:01,951 --> 01:42:06,194
[SPEAKER_17]: The deficit as it relates to the retirement fund, $28 million that the city has.

1284
01:42:06,754 --> 01:42:09,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, nobody wants to discuss that and how you're going to go forward with that.

1285
01:42:09,917 --> 01:42:11,658
[SPEAKER_17]: And more importantly, a fire and police department.

1286
01:42:11,898 --> 01:42:13,920
[SPEAKER_17]: Does that mean now fire and police are going to be separated?

1287
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:16,001
[SPEAKER_17]: Or is it not going to be separated?

1288
01:42:16,601 --> 01:42:20,403
[SPEAKER_17]: You haven't even gotten a final answer as it relates to the police department going forward.

1289
01:42:20,423 --> 01:42:34,009
[SPEAKER_17]: If they take down the station over there for the training tower for the fire department, and you're going to go to a regional location, that's going to put the fire department at issue for backup, because they're going to have to send their truck and their men to that regional location.

1290
01:42:34,910 --> 01:42:36,070
[SPEAKER_17]: A public safety issue.

1291
01:42:37,951 --> 01:42:39,172
[SPEAKER_04]: One information, Councilor Knight.

1292
01:42:40,452 --> 01:42:46,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Training tower is being addressed by a working group that's headed up by the chief and made up of members of the fire department's training division.

1293
01:42:46,436 --> 01:42:57,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I do also believe that their wish, inclination, desire, and focus is to have a training tower that's located in the city of Medford that may be open to regional communities.

1294
01:42:57,263 --> 01:43:00,745
[SPEAKER_05]: However, it would be maintained, dictated, and controlled by the city of Medford.

1295
01:43:00,785 --> 01:43:05,408
[SPEAKER_05]: That's based upon some meetings that I've had with the training team and the administration, Mr. President.

1296
01:43:06,068 --> 01:43:07,029
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1297
01:43:07,269 --> 01:43:08,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President, the Medford Public Schools

1298
01:43:10,216 --> 01:43:19,805
[SPEAKER_17]: as in the commentary from the superintendent, would like to meet with state and local governments as it relates to current code, including fire doors, fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and safety conditions.

1299
01:43:20,833 --> 01:43:25,875
[SPEAKER_17]: All things that right now are in potential violation are, if not in violation, as we presently speak.

1300
01:43:26,456 --> 01:43:41,683
[SPEAKER_17]: After the new, I believe we all can remember, after the new science labs were built, there was a major problem for almost a year where a fire person had to be up at the high school because the fire system, the fire alarm system didn't work as it related to something happened, whether through the electrical department or what have you.

1301
01:43:42,303 --> 01:43:47,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Then, if I understand this correctly, in Mr. Belson's commentary,

1302
01:43:48,352 --> 01:43:49,553
[SPEAKER_17]: And I agree with you 100%.

1303
01:43:50,033 --> 01:44:00,697
[SPEAKER_17]: You said any decision regarding the specific projects and the financial commitments would be developed over time and after multiple meetings within city government and at the state level.

1304
01:44:02,017 --> 01:44:12,881
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, at least he's got the ability to understand and recognize that city government officials need to sit down and discuss it, much more than the person who calls herself the mayor of this community.

1305
01:44:13,605 --> 01:44:16,766
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a big issue, whether you want to realize it or not.

1306
01:44:17,066 --> 01:44:18,707
[SPEAKER_17]: The building is 50 years old.

1307
01:44:18,747 --> 01:44:21,588
[SPEAKER_17]: You're talking about the same fire and police station that's down there right now.

1308
01:44:21,928 --> 01:44:23,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Maintenance didn't take place in the building.

1309
01:44:24,089 --> 01:44:30,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, a lot of these things are maintenance driven, whether they be fire, whether they be the windows, whether they be the boiler or what have you, the asbestos.

1310
01:44:31,092 --> 01:44:31,753
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a big building.

1311
01:44:31,793 --> 01:44:34,454
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's four and a half miles long, Mr. Superintendent.

1312
01:44:35,274 --> 01:44:37,175
[SPEAKER_17]: 550,000 square feet, whatever it might be.

1313
01:44:37,915 --> 01:44:41,036
[SPEAKER_17]: It was built at a time to be a college campus type of a school.

1314
01:44:43,069 --> 01:44:43,910
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's not the point.

1315
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:46,371
[SPEAKER_17]: You're getting a lot of this all at once.

1316
01:44:47,172 --> 01:45:02,402
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe, to some degree, maybe, whether it's the cafeteria or whatever the auditorium is that they... Maybe if you just stuck to the real desperate needs that the building has on a slow annual basis, you can look at these other things and put them into the budget.

1317
01:45:03,242 --> 01:45:05,344
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me just remind you, and I'll just leave you with this last thought.

1318
01:45:06,144 --> 01:45:07,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Just look at the city of Somerville.

1319
01:45:07,785 --> 01:45:10,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Look at all the development that's taken place over there.

1320
01:45:11,187 --> 01:45:12,068
[SPEAKER_17]: All the development.

1321
01:45:12,978 --> 01:45:13,278
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay?

1322
01:45:14,299 --> 01:45:18,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Many, many more jobs, and their taxes keep on going up.

1323
01:45:19,481 --> 01:45:36,708
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't have that opportunity here in the city of Medford, because if we're going to follow the mainstream of Somerville and taxing the citizens of this community to pay for bond indebtedness that you can't afford, and as Council Marks and others have alluded to, you're going to get yourself into a Proposition 2.5 override, it'll lose.

1324
01:45:36,748 --> 01:45:41,630
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone behind this council, I guarantee you, will lose if you'll be supportive of that, if you're serving at that point in time.

1325
01:45:42,334 --> 01:45:43,415
[SPEAKER_17]: You need to plan ahead.

1326
01:45:44,095 --> 01:45:46,557
[SPEAKER_17]: And when you plan ahead, you'll be able to address these issues.

1327
01:45:47,117 --> 01:45:48,438
[SPEAKER_17]: These have been long overdue.

1328
01:45:48,478 --> 01:45:49,138
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a shame.

1329
01:45:49,678 --> 01:45:54,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Prior school committees ought to hang their head in embarrassment for allowing this to go this long.

1330
01:45:54,481 --> 01:46:02,346
[SPEAKER_17]: And so should the city of Medford, because that's been their downfall, letting their buildings run into a demise situation year in and year out.

1331
01:46:02,726 --> 01:46:04,247
[SPEAKER_17]: And now you're going to pay the price for it.

1332
01:46:04,667 --> 01:46:04,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1333
01:46:06,368 --> 01:46:07,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1334
01:46:07,929 --> 01:46:10,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, move the question.

1335
01:46:10,611 --> 01:46:10,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

1336
01:46:12,131 --> 01:46:15,414
[SPEAKER_09]: As amended, Mr. Belson, do you want to finish up with anything?

1337
01:46:15,434 --> 01:46:18,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to finish a couple of quick statements, if I may, with your permission.

1338
01:46:19,817 --> 01:46:26,523
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, some of the things that were quoted were quoted as the priorities of the state.

1339
01:46:26,963 --> 01:46:30,546
[SPEAKER_09]: When they say the building structurally unsound, that's not what we're saying.

1340
01:46:30,566 --> 01:46:34,650
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what the state is using as a category for things that you can put things under.

1341
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:39,954
[SPEAKER_09]: When the building says that the renovation of schools such as roofs, that's what they're saying you can ask for.

1342
01:46:40,485 --> 01:46:42,586
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not what we're saying is our need.

1343
01:46:43,027 --> 01:46:43,767
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the first thing.

1344
01:46:44,147 --> 01:46:51,792
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as handicapped accessibility, we put in three elevators, ramps, we've made the Little Theater or the Karen Theater now handicapped accessible.

1345
01:46:52,133 --> 01:46:53,774
[SPEAKER_09]: The building is handicapped accessible.

1346
01:46:54,294 --> 01:47:08,263
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a lot of things, and with all due respect to, I understand there's a give and take here, but the reality is that a lot of improvements have been made to that high school and that technical school, and you have helped to pay for it over the years as a city council and as a school committee.

1347
01:47:08,802 --> 01:47:16,746
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee had a right, when this thing came out, to deliberate and determine what it considered to be important and to talk about it.

1348
01:47:17,126 --> 01:47:18,246
[SPEAKER_09]: And they had a committee of the whole.

1349
01:47:18,426 --> 01:47:21,808
[SPEAKER_09]: And they then had a follow-up meeting where they voted it.

1350
01:47:22,448 --> 01:47:23,068
[SPEAKER_09]: You're getting it.

1351
01:47:23,689 --> 01:47:30,252
[SPEAKER_09]: And all we're asking is for you to allow us to submit it so we can then begin a process of finding out what's possible.

1352
01:47:30,832 --> 01:47:37,335
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we can have a more robust interactive process between council, school committee, mayor, administration,

1353
01:47:37,661 --> 01:47:46,744
[SPEAKER_09]: to determine what this city considers important, what this city wants to fund on its own, what this city wants to partner with, and what we're going to do in what time frame.

1354
01:47:46,764 --> 01:47:48,104
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all we're looking for tonight.

1355
01:47:48,324 --> 01:47:48,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1356
01:47:48,624 --> 01:47:49,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Belson.

[SPEAKER_07]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1378
01:48:12,844 --> 01:48:13,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't get to speak on this?

1379
01:48:14,685 --> 01:48:15,446
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get to speak?

1380
01:48:16,206 --> 01:48:17,587
[SPEAKER_06]: We're done with that issue, Mr. Bignone.

1381
01:48:17,748 --> 01:48:19,509
[SPEAKER_06]: But you said that we could still speak.

[SPEAKER_06]: You said you weren't going to shut the- We're done with that issue, Mr. Bignone.

1383
01:48:22,251 --> 01:48:23,512
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you lost in criminal court.

1384
01:48:23,532 --> 01:48:24,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion's been disposed of.

1385
01:48:25,353 --> 01:48:30,597

1395
01:49:09,744 --> 01:49:12,925
[SPEAKER_13]: I reside at 75 Ashcroft Road in Medford.

1396
01:49:13,685 --> 01:49:26,371
[SPEAKER_13]: The brief synopsis is, in this case, the claimant, 62 years old, a Medford resident, slipped and fell in March of last year right around 392 Main Street.

1397
01:49:26,951 --> 01:49:33,334
[SPEAKER_13]: As a result, she broke several bones in her left foot, including twisting her left ankle.

1401
01:49:50,933 --> 01:49:51,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if I may?

1402
01:49:53,654 --> 01:49:55,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight, has the street defect been repaired?

1403
01:49:56,434 --> 01:49:57,755
[SPEAKER_13]: Across the street, it has.

1404
01:49:58,655 --> 01:50:03,996
[SPEAKER_13]: That particular location, though, in anticipation of your question, Councilor, I went out today to look at the property.

1405
01:50:04,490 --> 01:50:05,211
[SPEAKER_13]: and took pictures.

1406
01:50:05,251 --> 01:50:09,374
[SPEAKER_13]: That area that technically a lot of Main Street could use improvement.

1407
01:50:10,235 --> 01:50:18,882
[SPEAKER_13]: So I submitted an inquiry to DPW again to make sure that that particular area, as well as across the street, which was previously fixed, is repaired as well.

1408
01:50:19,102 --> 01:50:20,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

1409
01:50:20,123 --> 01:50:21,324

1410
01:50:21,344 --> 01:50:25,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd request that the solicitor forward that information to the council when she receives it.

1411
01:50:25,508 --> 01:50:25,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1413
01:50:26,649 --> 01:50:30,132

1457
01:52:42,974 --> 01:52:44,755
[SPEAKER_07]: You can give us a brief synopsis of the project, please.

1458
01:52:45,616 --> 01:52:51,861
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, we currently have a cast-iron main that goes up through a lot that's for a new waypoint building going up.

1459
01:52:52,282 --> 01:53:01,309
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to relocate 52 feet of 4-inch down the street, about 100 feet to cross, so it goes into the easement for a new main to go up the side so they can do their construction safely.

1460
01:53:01,789 --> 01:53:04,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is Winthrop Street up by Smith Lane, is that correct?

1461
01:53:05,472 --> 01:53:06,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

1462
01:53:06,433 --> 01:53:07,754
[SPEAKER_07]: And how much of the street will you be digging up?

1463
01:53:08,795 --> 01:53:10,376
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, part of the project is about 430 feet.

1464
01:53:11,603 --> 01:53:18,808
[SPEAKER_19]: and that's for a main replacement on a leak-prone pipe, along with the association of 52 feet that will be crossing Winthrop Street to the easement for the new main.

1465
01:53:21,450 --> 01:53:22,771
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1466
01:53:24,292 --> 01:53:32,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, first of all, I want to preface my remarks by saying I approve of this project and support of it, and I'm in support of it.

1467
01:53:33,399 --> 01:53:38,423
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I urge our friends from the utility company that they need to be

1468
01:53:39,492 --> 01:53:42,653
[SPEAKER_03]: extra sensitive to the neighbors in that area.

1469
01:53:42,693 --> 01:53:54,397
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been under tremendous duress of recent times with construction, repaving, utility work in that vicinity, and it's created great stress and unease with them.

1470
01:53:54,917 --> 01:54:06,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's essential that all efforts be made to prevent inconveniences to anybody who's there, whose houses may abut this digging.

1471
01:54:07,138 --> 01:54:21,088
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to hold up construction at all, but at the same time, we want to preserve the tranquility of those who reside there and see to it that the street is returned to its pristine condition.

1472
01:54:22,309 --> 01:54:23,510
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Donovan.

1473
01:54:23,770 --> 01:54:24,611
[SPEAKER_16]: Chairman Scarpelli.

1474
01:54:24,791 --> 01:54:29,054
[SPEAKER_16]: If I can, the dates publicly for the project, when are you looking to start?

1475
01:54:30,155 --> 01:54:31,596
[SPEAKER_19]: We're looking to start this upcoming Monday.

1476
01:54:32,215 --> 01:54:32,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Monday?

1477
01:54:32,676 --> 01:54:32,856
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1478
01:54:33,356 --> 01:54:36,800
[SPEAKER_16]: And the times of hours of work?

1479
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:40,703
[SPEAKER_19]: That would be under the direction of the engineering department from the city.

1480
01:54:41,224 --> 01:54:45,108
[SPEAKER_19]: That has not been discussed yet, but we do a pre-construction walk once it's been approved by yourself.

1481
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:46,269
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1482
01:54:46,309 --> 01:54:52,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, has anyone in the engineering department talked about the, I believe that street's going to be

1483
01:54:53,576 --> 01:54:55,977
[SPEAKER_16]: dug up again in a few weeks, correct?

1484
01:54:56,017 --> 01:54:57,277
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it maybe a few months?

1485
01:54:57,597 --> 01:54:58,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, coming down the lines.

1486
01:54:59,398 --> 01:55:00,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it three years?

1487
01:55:00,078 --> 01:55:00,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a year or two.

1488
01:55:00,978 --> 01:55:01,358
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1489
01:55:01,378 --> 01:55:22,404
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, I think just reiterating, just making sure that the sidewalk, you know, anything that's where people are walking, excuse me, the street, that it's put back where, and then revisited again in six months, making sure that there was no dippage or, you know, so any future holes later.

1490
01:55:23,617 --> 01:55:24,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Understood.

1491
01:55:24,037 --> 01:55:24,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1492
01:55:25,097 --> 01:55:25,877
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, everything else.

1493
01:55:26,098 --> 01:55:26,878
[SPEAKER_16]: See, that's an order.

1494
01:55:26,958 --> 01:55:29,518
[SPEAKER_16]: So I move for approval.

1495
01:55:29,618 --> 01:55:35,679
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Mr. President, uh, I am sure Mr. Kamadi is familiar with the area in the neighborhood.

1496
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:43,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I'm sure he's also aware that we do have a public school in the vicinity of the location where they're going to be doing construction.

1497
01:55:43,921 --> 01:55:48,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's my understanding as he just stated that the construction schedule will be up to the office of the city engineer.

1498
01:55:49,262 --> 01:55:53,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'd ask the city engineering office by way of an amendment or a second paper, um,

1499
01:55:53,829 --> 01:55:59,577
[SPEAKER_05]: restrict the construction during the rush hour periods when schools drop off and school pickup is occurring, Mr. President.

1500
01:56:00,158 --> 01:56:01,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor.

1501
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:02,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Mox.

1502
01:56:07,407 --> 01:56:08,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1503
01:56:08,769 --> 01:56:11,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Will there be any limitations for people using the driveways?

1504
01:56:12,658 --> 01:56:18,720
[SPEAKER_19]: If there is anyone affected during the day for their driveways, our foreman on site will coordinate with them to let them know when they can go in and out.

1505
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:25,083
[SPEAKER_19]: If not, we can also put a plate down for them to access the driveway, but only be for a day period, if anything, and they'd be notified prior.

1506
01:56:26,043 --> 01:56:27,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So when will they receive notification?

1507
01:56:29,064 --> 01:56:29,805
[SPEAKER_19]: 48 hours in advance.

1508
01:56:30,485 --> 01:56:35,587
[SPEAKER_19]: The new foreman will try to notify, leave a door hanger out on the door if they're going to be in front.

1509
01:56:35,627 --> 01:56:41,049
[SPEAKER_19]: We also post no parking signs in the location that we will be trenching for that day to let residents know.

1510
01:56:42,357 --> 01:56:45,739
[SPEAKER_08]: And are there any expectations regarding the traffic flow?

1511
01:56:45,819 --> 01:56:48,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to have to close a partial lane?

1512
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:51,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is there any consideration with that?

1513
01:56:52,203 --> 01:56:58,586
[SPEAKER_19]: We should be able to keep two lanes of traffic flowing since our new installation will be in the curb line closer to the side.

1514
01:56:58,606 --> 01:57:00,427
[SPEAKER_19]: So we won't have any issue keeping traffic flow.

1515
01:57:01,388 --> 01:57:04,770
[SPEAKER_19]: As many details are needed will be directed by direction of the captain.

1516
01:57:04,910 --> 01:57:07,011
[SPEAKER_19]: And whatever is needed for traffic flow, we certainly will do.

1517
01:57:07,531 --> 01:57:10,393
[SPEAKER_08]: So you already have a detailed plan from the police department?

1518
01:57:11,155 --> 01:57:14,077
[SPEAKER_19]: That is an on-site meeting that takes place at the start of the job.

1519
01:57:15,519 --> 01:57:15,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Say that again?

1520
01:57:16,479 --> 01:57:21,824
[SPEAKER_19]: The direction of how traffic is set up is an on-site meeting that happens at the prior or at the start of the job.

1521
01:57:21,884 --> 01:57:27,628
[SPEAKER_19]: Because the beginning of the job is only verification holes, which is a very small portion of the roadway that will be taken up.

1522
01:57:27,668 --> 01:57:29,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Before trenching begins, it is under that direction.

1523
01:57:29,650 --> 01:57:32,372
[SPEAKER_08]: So prior to Monday, because you said Monday the construction is going to start?

1524
01:57:33,033 --> 01:57:36,576
[SPEAKER_19]: Once this is approved, then we can move forward with anything that needs to be done prior to construction.

1525
01:57:36,596 --> 01:57:38,197
[SPEAKER_19]: But we need approval from the council first.

1526
01:57:38,735 --> 01:57:45,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, but that traffic impact of mitigation will take place prior to the start date.

1527
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:45,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1528
01:57:45,959 --> 01:57:46,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1529
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:47,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1530
01:57:47,961 --> 01:57:52,423
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight, when the streets resurfaced, who's responsible for the striping?

1531
01:57:53,884 --> 01:57:57,707
[SPEAKER_19]: We normally are responsible for the striping, unless the city has future plans.

1532
01:57:57,807 --> 01:58:04,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And you are aware that there is a bike lane that's been put along Winthrop Street in that vicinity?

1533
01:58:04,831 --> 01:58:05,011
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1534
01:58:05,171 --> 01:58:05,411
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

1535
01:58:05,992 --> 01:58:06,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1536
01:58:07,467 --> 01:58:07,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1537
01:58:08,027 --> 01:58:12,168
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, as seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1538
01:58:12,308 --> 01:58:13,028
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1539
01:58:13,048 --> 01:58:13,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1540
01:58:13,888 --> 01:58:14,668
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1541
01:58:16,049 --> 01:58:16,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1542
01:58:17,149 --> 01:58:17,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1543
01:58:18,009 --> 01:58:18,349
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1544
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:23,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

1545
01:58:23,690 --> 01:58:36,013
[SPEAKER_07]: 17303, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the DPW commissioner provide the council with the schedule for crosswalk and roadway re-striping.

1546
01:58:36,133 --> 01:58:36,733
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1547
01:58:37,640 --> 01:58:40,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I put this forward two weeks ago.

1548
01:58:41,303 --> 01:58:44,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess it was wishful thinking, then the snow came, and here we are.

1549
01:58:44,826 --> 01:58:45,587
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not spring yet.

1550
01:58:46,368 --> 01:58:53,634
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I'm just wondering when the DPW is going to go out and begin restriping our crosswalks and our streets.

1551
01:58:53,714 --> 01:58:58,578
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some faded paint out there that is annually in the need of repair and replacement.

1552
01:58:59,279 --> 01:59:03,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would like the DPW commissioner to provide us with a schedule as to when that is going to occur.

1553
01:59:04,043 --> 01:59:05,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd ask my council colleagues to

1554
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:08,843
[SPEAKER_05]: join me in supporting this resolution and move for approval.

1555
01:59:10,224 --> 01:59:10,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor.

1556
01:59:10,884 --> 01:59:11,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1557
01:59:12,245 --> 01:59:21,874
[SPEAKER_16]: If I can just add on to that, I know that it might be, I know that, uh, Mr. Cairns did respond to us about Evans street, but didn't respond back on Paris street.

1558
01:59:22,374 --> 01:59:29,300
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you can just, uh, if you could just reach back, uh, come back to us with a response on the repaving of Paris street.

1559
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:30,001
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1560
01:59:30,841 --> 01:59:31,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor.

1561
01:59:32,064 --> 01:59:33,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Council President Caraviello.

1562
01:59:33,446 --> 01:59:34,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1563
01:59:34,186 --> 01:59:40,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I know this is a topic of yours with the thermoplastic painting.

1564
01:59:40,894 --> 01:59:44,258
[SPEAKER_07]: During this year's MMA show, I went there.

1565
01:59:44,298 --> 01:59:49,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I had an opportunity to meet with the company that does the, that sells the thermoplastic painting.

1566
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:55,042
[SPEAKER_07]: And I met with some other city officials who have done the thermoplastic painting.

1567
01:59:56,103 --> 02:00:02,245
[SPEAKER_07]: Not on all the lines or anything, but they have at least done the crosswalks at different schools in different places.

1568
02:00:03,066 --> 02:00:10,208
[SPEAKER_07]: And they said that the thermoplastic lasts five to six years, and it's been a win for them.

1569
02:00:10,869 --> 02:00:14,130
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to see us do that again this year.

1570
02:00:14,370 --> 02:00:16,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you've championed this for many years,

1571
02:00:16,898 --> 02:00:19,140
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I think it's something that it should be done.

1572
02:00:19,480 --> 02:00:23,423
[SPEAKER_07]: The company even said they would come down here and do one for free to show us how it would work.

1573
02:00:23,963 --> 02:00:25,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we should take them up on it.

1574
02:00:26,205 --> 02:00:29,708
[SPEAKER_07]: And I say at least to do the crosswalks, the schools, and different things like that.

1575
02:00:29,728 --> 02:00:31,229
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to do the whole city with them.

1576
02:00:32,670 --> 02:00:33,971
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like to amend that.

1577
02:00:37,453 --> 02:00:37,994
[SPEAKER_08]: As amended.

1578
02:00:38,550 --> 02:00:43,013
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion, if I just could add, Council President Caraviello is absolutely correct.

1579
02:00:43,033 --> 02:00:54,262
[SPEAKER_08]: The thermoplastic crosswalks are highly reflective, they're slip resistant, they have a life expectancy of four to five years, and they're cost effective in the long run.

1580
02:00:54,342 --> 02:00:56,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Bill O'Regan said six years, they've gotten out of this.

1581
02:00:56,323 --> 02:00:56,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Six years.

1582
02:00:57,644 --> 02:01:00,966
[SPEAKER_08]: The state uses them for the state highway and many of their projects.

1583
02:01:01,447 --> 02:01:07,171
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a very effective and efficient way of laying down a painted crosswalk.

1584
02:01:07,531 --> 02:01:09,513
[SPEAKER_08]: without the upkeep year to year of repainting.

1585
02:01:10,173 --> 02:01:21,061
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion by Councilor Dello Russo for approval as amended by Councilor Scott Peli, as further amended by Councilor President Caraviello.

1586
02:01:21,221 --> 02:01:21,761
[SPEAKER_08]: All in favor?

1587
02:01:22,262 --> 02:01:22,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1588
02:01:22,642 --> 02:01:23,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

1589
02:01:23,563 --> 02:01:24,183
[SPEAKER_08]: The ayes have it.

1590
02:01:24,744 --> 02:01:25,704
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion is adopted.

1591
02:01:25,724 --> 02:01:28,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Mr. Vice President.

1592
02:01:34,167 --> 02:01:47,637
[SPEAKER_07]: 17-304, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request an opinion as to if we can vote to change our zoning one section or even one street at a time.

1593
02:01:47,718 --> 02:01:48,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1594
02:01:49,479 --> 02:01:51,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1595
02:01:52,121 --> 02:02:00,968
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that a number of residents and I have been discussing along with, I believe, a few other prior councilors

1596
02:02:02,016 --> 02:02:07,440
[SPEAKER_14]: something that this council is beginning to discuss and have meetings on in subcommittee.

1597
02:02:09,022 --> 02:02:21,011
[SPEAKER_14]: After doing some research with regards to how Seminole is handling their zoning changes, I read a few articles on it, and it sounds like they started their process about two years ago.

1598
02:02:21,571 --> 02:02:25,874
[SPEAKER_14]: And the last I read sometime this fall, they were still working on it.

1599
02:02:27,145 --> 02:02:28,486
[SPEAKER_14]: They're actively working on it.

1600
02:02:28,526 --> 02:02:30,088
[SPEAKER_14]: They've had community meetings.

1601
02:02:30,148 --> 02:02:31,849
[SPEAKER_14]: They've had subcommittee meetings.

1602
02:02:31,989 --> 02:02:36,033
[SPEAKER_14]: They've created a committee to review their zoning in its entirety.

1603
02:02:36,053 --> 02:02:38,975
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like they're doing it extensively.

1604
02:02:39,416 --> 02:02:54,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, it's been brought up before that we should reach out to, I forget the gentleman's name, but reach out to the person from Somerville who is overseeing this project and get some ideas on how we can do it.

1605
02:02:54,510 --> 02:03:16,125
[SPEAKER_14]: But in the meantime, we have a situation where a number of huge developments have gone up, a number of highly dense residential dwellings have gone up, whether it be Luminaire, we have one coming up on Middlesex Ave, and obviously a couple of controversial properties that have come down the line and have created controversy, I should say.

1606
02:03:16,145 --> 02:03:23,791
[SPEAKER_14]: And it seems like the public and the public that have been reaching out to me and that I've been reading

1607
02:03:24,368 --> 02:03:31,814
[SPEAKER_14]: discussing these issues are interested in developing, they're interested in not seeing empty storefronts.

1608
02:03:32,375 --> 02:03:45,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Our residents are interested in redeveloping to a point where it's beneficial for the city and beneficial, how I should say it, beneficial for the neighborhood in a way that complements the neighborhood.

1609
02:03:46,007 --> 02:03:52,072
[SPEAKER_14]: And what we're seeing with regards to, especially in the past, the number of variances that have been allowed

1610
02:03:52,580 --> 02:04:05,026
[SPEAKER_14]: We're seeing a need for zoning change in this community, and we're seeing it, we're in need of it far prior to how long it would take this city council to review it in its entirety.

1611
02:04:05,386 --> 02:04:22,034
[SPEAKER_14]: So my question, and I haven't reviewed any acts, and I know Councilor Knight just mentioned an act, so he can bring that up, but I'm looking for an opinion, whether that be from our city solicitor or reaching out to Somerville, some way to find out if we, as a city council, can review

1612
02:04:22,719 --> 02:04:26,921
[SPEAKER_14]: whether it be a section of the city at a time, a street at a time.

1613
02:04:27,362 --> 02:04:34,145
[SPEAKER_14]: We know of developers who are very interested in developing in certain areas, and we want to make sure that we protect our neighborhoods.

1614
02:04:34,585 --> 02:04:37,047
[SPEAKER_14]: And you've seen that at the last few zoning meetings.

1615
02:04:38,428 --> 02:04:52,055
[SPEAKER_14]: The public have been forced to have to come to the table and bring their concerns and questions and downright just opposition to certain projects, which is unfortunate.

1616
02:04:52,720 --> 02:05:00,441
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it does, whether or not zoning is going to be the solve-all, I don't think so, because we do still have the process of variances.

1617
02:05:00,501 --> 02:05:08,203
[SPEAKER_14]: But with the new board and with proper zoning changes, I think we can make this a better process, and I think we can protect our neighborhoods.

1618
02:05:08,283 --> 02:05:11,843
[SPEAKER_14]: So my question to our city solicitor would be, can we do this?

1619
02:05:11,883 --> 02:05:18,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we sit down as a committee of the whole and discuss, I think, the latest project, Salem Street, for example?

1620
02:05:18,764 --> 02:05:21,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody else has mentioned Fountain Street is zoned apartment one.

1621
02:05:23,214 --> 02:05:30,601
[SPEAKER_14]: Can we take an individual section of our city and say, okay, what is zone where and this is the problem?

1622
02:05:30,661 --> 02:05:34,505
[SPEAKER_14]: And then call that street or section in for a meeting.

1623
02:05:34,565 --> 02:05:44,356
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, ask the public to weigh in on what do you want to see in your residential neighborhood or your business districts that are right outside your residential neighborhood?

1624
02:05:45,221 --> 02:05:56,763
[SPEAKER_14]: seems like the administration is pushing for housing, housing, housing everywhere, which is not great for our infrastructure, our schools, our traffic, our parking problems that we have on so many different levels.

1625
02:05:57,303 --> 02:06:03,665
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I'm hearing from the people is we don't want to turn into Somerville, Cambridge, or Boston, these chairlifts we're talking about.

1626
02:06:03,685 --> 02:06:05,005
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't want to turn into Boston.

1627
02:06:05,045 --> 02:06:14,267
[SPEAKER_14]: We have more single-family districts or single-double-family districts in Medford than Cambridge and Somerville have, and people do not want

1628
02:06:14,685 --> 02:06:18,826
[SPEAKER_14]: to see us turn into Boston, and nor do I. Our schools can't handle it.

1629
02:06:19,646 --> 02:06:23,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Our streets, sidewalks, infrastructure, parking, traffic cannot handle it.

1630
02:06:24,267 --> 02:06:26,847
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think zoning is something that we need to discuss.

1631
02:06:27,387 --> 02:06:30,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, I have a long-term plan, but we need to discuss it.

1632
02:06:31,108 --> 02:06:36,789
[SPEAKER_14]: If we can do it in a quicker fashion, I think we need to at least explore that option.

1633
02:06:36,849 --> 02:06:43,070
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is one way that I think it could be possible, and I'm hoping that we get a positive result from it.

1634
02:06:43,433 --> 02:06:51,939
[SPEAKER_14]: And we can take those sections of our city that are plugged hotspots for developers and really figure out what's best for our neighborhoods.

1635
02:06:52,539 --> 02:06:53,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1636
02:06:53,380 --> 02:06:53,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knife.

1637
02:06:54,581 --> 02:06:56,802
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the resolution.

1638
02:06:56,862 --> 02:07:00,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel as though getting an opinion from the solicitor is a great start for this conversation.

1639
02:07:01,045 --> 02:07:07,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I also think it's very important for the council as we move forward to consider the impact that zoning has on our tax rate.

1640
02:07:08,803 --> 02:07:21,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we have a bifurcated tax rate, we have the ability to equitably shift the residential property tax burden from the residential properties to the industrial and commercially zoned properties.

1641
02:07:21,491 --> 02:07:26,834
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we're seeing a lot of use variances where they're going to try and eliminate these commercial and industrial properties.

1642
02:07:26,854 --> 02:07:35,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very important that we maintain a good stock of commercial and industrial properties so that we do have the ability to provide residential property tax relief, Mr. President.

1643
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:37,981
[SPEAKER_05]: So, moving forward, I think that's a very important aspect.

1644
02:07:39,056 --> 02:07:40,357
[SPEAKER_05]: of zoning here in the community.

1645
02:07:40,997 --> 02:07:42,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lungo-Kerr was absolutely right.

1646
02:07:43,019 --> 02:07:55,871
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when we go back and we think five, six, and seven years ago when the website, the real estate website Reddit found Medford, the first thing that they said was unbelievable tracks of open space and natural resources and a large stock of single family homes.

1647
02:07:56,271 --> 02:08:03,878
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we begin to develop and grow here in Medford, we're moving away from our large stock of single family homes and we're moving into high density apartments, Mr. President.

1648
02:08:04,300 --> 02:08:05,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And in some areas of the city, that's OK.

1649
02:08:06,521 --> 02:08:07,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And in some places, that's good.

1650
02:08:07,761 --> 02:08:16,545
[SPEAKER_05]: And the mixed-use growth, I think, is an excellent opportunity for us to pursue an equitable shift between the commercial, industrial, and residential tax properties and the burdens that are provided to the residents.

1651
02:08:16,865 --> 02:08:18,926
[SPEAKER_05]: But going forward, there are a number of issues that we need to look at.

1652
02:08:18,946 --> 02:08:27,069
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that one of them would be maintaining a good balance of commercial and industrial zone properties, as well as increasing our stock of affordable housing.

1653
02:08:27,409 --> 02:08:33,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as our real estate market begins to thrive, the people that have lived in this community for so long and made Medford such a great place to live are being displaced.

1654
02:08:34,272 --> 02:08:35,272
[SPEAKER_05]: and they have no place to go.

1655
02:08:35,372 --> 02:08:38,574
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're actually getting forced out of Medford because they can no longer afford to live here.

1656
02:08:38,954 --> 02:08:45,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And our stock of affordable housing is so low at this point in time, Mr. President, there's really no other option for them but to leave the community that they helped make great.

1657
02:08:45,556 --> 02:08:48,898
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this matter forward.

1658
02:08:48,918 --> 02:08:52,819
[SPEAKER_05]: I support it wholeheartedly, and I would anxiously await the solicitor's opinion.

1659
02:08:52,979 --> 02:08:53,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1660
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:54,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Good motion.

1661
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:56,181
[SPEAKER_07]: You both are 100% correct.

1662
02:08:56,661 --> 02:09:02,103
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, as seconded by Councilor Knight, name and address for the record, please.

1663
02:09:02,625 --> 02:09:03,626
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

1664
02:09:03,666 --> 02:09:05,088
[SPEAKER_01]: I live at 281 Park Street.

1665
02:09:05,889 --> 02:09:13,959
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty happy to see that this is coming up, because I've spoken here countless times about that we need to follow zoning.

1666
02:09:14,400 --> 02:09:20,067
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second part of that is that we also need to look at the zoning that we currently have and see if that zoning is working for us.

1667
02:09:21,112 --> 02:09:32,018
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled out a zoning map of Medford today and I looked around my neighborhood and I saw that all of Salem Street and pretty much every street from Fulton Street to 93 was zoned apartment 1.

1668
02:09:33,138 --> 02:09:43,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I drove here and took 10 minutes to drive from Park Street to City Hall, which is pretty crazy because it's four blocks, all the traffic, I thought, can we really handle that many apartment buildings?

1669
02:09:45,385 --> 02:09:54,151
[SPEAKER_01]: on Salem Street in that area with traffic, with the school that's the largest elementary school in the city, and overcrowded?

1670
02:09:54,211 --> 02:09:54,872
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we can't.

1671
02:09:54,952 --> 02:09:56,633
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really need to move forward.

1672
02:09:56,653 --> 02:10:00,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there is calls for hiring consultants, but that can take a lot of time.

1673
02:10:01,216 --> 02:10:07,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone who attended the zoning meeting on the Salem Street project said, well, you know, one apartment building isn't going to do it.

1674
02:10:07,240 --> 02:10:12,784
[SPEAKER_01]: But they did have a stack of support letters from people that owned property on Salem Street.

1675
02:10:13,845 --> 02:10:18,026
[SPEAKER_01]: that would probably be the next buildings that come up and want to add apartment buildings.

1676
02:10:18,086 --> 02:10:21,968
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could be six more buildings in the next year or two, 10 more buildings.

1677
02:10:22,008 --> 02:10:25,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'd swing around down Fountain Street and add another 10 or 15 or 20 buildings.

1678
02:10:26,209 --> 02:10:28,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would cripple that entire side of the city.

1679
02:10:28,690 --> 02:10:30,031
[SPEAKER_01]: We would change the dynamic.

1680
02:10:31,271 --> 02:10:34,112
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents have lived in that neighborhood for more than 15 years.

1681
02:10:34,172 --> 02:10:36,453
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a heavy owner-occupied neighborhood.

1682
02:10:36,553 --> 02:10:40,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I live on another side that's also heavily owner-occupied.

1683
02:10:40,774 --> 02:10:43,215
[SPEAKER_01]: More than 80% of Medford is owner-occupied.

1684
02:10:43,904 --> 02:10:50,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Shifting to more buildings where people are not coming out and talking to their neighbors is really not what Medford is about.

1685
02:10:51,133 --> 02:10:57,380
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really need to be cognizant of whether our quality of life is more important than just adding more buildings.

1686
02:10:57,700 --> 02:11:01,204
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you add more buildings, they don't just drop tax money off at the city.

1687
02:11:01,565 --> 02:11:03,127
[SPEAKER_01]: They come with infrastructure needs.

1688
02:11:03,167 --> 02:11:04,248
[SPEAKER_01]: They come with costs.

1689
02:11:04,735 --> 02:11:08,358
[SPEAKER_01]: And do those costs exceed the tax money that we get?

1690
02:11:08,418 --> 02:11:11,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know it looks great when it said, look, we got this much more tax money this year.

1691
02:11:12,241 --> 02:11:18,306
[SPEAKER_01]: But we really have to factor in our infrastructure costs as we see that we're short police and we're short fire.

1692
02:11:18,686 --> 02:11:31,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't believe that these additional tax revenues that we're getting from the Lumiere's or the, I don't even want to say, but the Locust Street that hopefully will never happen, will not exceed the costs that they will add to our city.

1693
02:11:31,916 --> 02:11:33,678
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll diminish our quality of life.

1694
02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:35,701
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really need to think about that.

1695
02:11:36,201 --> 02:11:36,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1696
02:11:36,741 --> 02:11:37,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1697
02:11:40,363 --> 02:11:41,343
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address of the record, please.

1698
02:11:41,664 --> 02:11:43,404
[SPEAKER_18]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1699
02:11:45,145 --> 02:11:48,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Point to Councilor Knight.

1700
02:11:49,107 --> 02:11:57,631
[SPEAKER_18]: Being able to balance zoning is an incredibly important thing for a city to do because of the actual tax base.

1701
02:11:58,311 --> 02:12:01,353
[SPEAKER_18]: And having to be able to, or actually just being able to,

1702
02:12:01,883 --> 02:12:12,752
[SPEAKER_18]: increase the commercial tax base so you can actually either balance or decrease the residential tax base is an amazing prospect for the residents of Medford.

1703
02:12:13,112 --> 02:12:23,100
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think any resident in Medford would be more than happy to accept that kind of a balance or that shift in being able to kind of offset the burden.

1704
02:12:23,461 --> 02:12:28,224
[SPEAKER_18]: Secondly, being an old retailer, there is a major, major shift

1705
02:12:29,133 --> 02:12:44,659
[SPEAKER_18]: for shoppers to get out of the malls and get into neighborhoods, back into neighborhoods, back into what they call fabricated cities as you see in Somerville and in Wellington and up in, there's so many different places.

1706
02:12:45,139 --> 02:12:47,400
[SPEAKER_18]: So you really have to look at what we have.

1707
02:12:48,141 --> 02:12:53,343
[SPEAKER_18]: We have such great opportunity downtown and maybe reworking some of these zones to actually structure

1708
02:12:53,963 --> 02:12:54,865
[SPEAKER_18]: a future for that.

1709
02:12:55,467 --> 02:13:00,257
[SPEAKER_18]: This would be an excellent downtown for something like that.

1710
02:13:01,042 --> 02:13:19,711
[SPEAKER_18]: to be able to take advantage of the .75 tax, sales tax that you could take advantage of with additional restaurants and the hotel tax with the new hotel that's coming, you're really gonna position yourself to be able to go back to what we said earlier, which is plan for much bigger projects and better ideas.

1711
02:13:20,451 --> 02:13:28,535
[SPEAKER_18]: But you have to have the vision to understand that and you have to kind of try to fight your way towards that because I'll tell you, you've got a waterway, most cities don't.

1712
02:13:29,483 --> 02:13:33,448
[SPEAKER_18]: You've got such a proximity to Boston that most cities don't.

1713
02:13:33,808 --> 02:13:43,820
[SPEAKER_18]: You've got so many things working for us and in our favor that if we don't look at this and don't look at the rezoning, it's a missed opportunity for everyone.

1714
02:13:44,381 --> 02:13:46,664
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm telling you right now, that's the opportunity to gain.

1715
02:13:47,124 --> 02:13:53,568
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the opportunity to look at, because that is where most people are gravitating towards when it comes to shopping.

1716
02:13:54,029 --> 02:13:55,350
[SPEAKER_18]: And they want that lifestyle.

1717
02:13:55,390 --> 02:13:57,231
[SPEAKER_18]: They want that hometown feel again.

1718
02:13:57,811 --> 02:14:02,494
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm lucky enough to do business in a city like that, and that city does get it.

1719
02:14:02,975 --> 02:14:13,601
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can tell you the residents of that city, their tax burden year after year after year is constantly offset by people like myself and some other friends that do business in that city as well.

1720
02:14:13,642 --> 02:14:14,942
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's a great, great thing.

1721
02:14:15,022 --> 02:14:15,783
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

1722
02:14:16,063 --> 02:14:16,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1723
02:14:16,683 --> 02:14:17,464
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Falco.

1724
02:14:18,564 --> 02:14:18,924
[SPEAKER_07]: I yield.

1725
02:14:19,845 --> 02:14:21,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco yields to the podium.

1726
02:14:21,746 --> 02:14:23,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

1727
02:14:23,266 --> 02:14:23,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1728
02:14:23,726 --> 02:14:25,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

1729
02:14:26,448 --> 02:14:34,511
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's no secret that I am extremely passionate about both Medford and its development.

1730
02:14:35,772 --> 02:14:40,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I am totally heartened to see this come before the council.

1731
02:14:41,154 --> 02:14:42,935
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it is one of the most critical

1732
02:14:43,587 --> 02:14:46,129
[SPEAKER_10]: responsibilities that the City Council holds.

1733
02:14:47,089 --> 02:14:58,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Residents of this city make a social contract when we purchase here that where we purchase will stay similar, not the same, but similar to where we buy.

1734
02:14:59,297 --> 02:15:08,283
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that we are in some ways under attack from developers around us that are starting to come in and cannibalize us.

1735
02:15:09,143 --> 02:15:09,924
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm concerned

1736
02:15:10,598 --> 02:15:14,119
[SPEAKER_10]: for people who've made the decision to age in place here in Medford.

1737
02:15:15,579 --> 02:15:21,981
[SPEAKER_10]: We historically have people come and stay for generations and that is with thought, not by accident.

1738
02:15:23,781 --> 02:15:34,224
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel that if we're not careful, those families are going to be pushed out and Medford will be gentrified just as Somerville has been gentrified and Cambridge before it.

1739
02:15:35,208 --> 02:15:38,131
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Medford is in an enviable position.

1740
02:15:38,311 --> 02:15:42,416
[SPEAKER_10]: When you look at the surrounding cities, they don't have the green spaces that we have.

1741
02:15:42,556 --> 02:15:52,347
[SPEAKER_10]: When you look at their green maps, their teeny dots across the city, little islands, Medford has whole areas where we don't have development.

1742
02:15:53,007 --> 02:15:57,689
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we have an opportunity to be very purposeful about what we do.

1743
02:15:58,169 --> 02:16:03,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I always liken Medford to a diamond in the rough, because I do believe that.

1744
02:16:04,072 --> 02:16:08,894
[SPEAKER_10]: If you know a jeweler, they won't cleave a diamond until they're sure of what they're doing.

1745
02:16:09,054 --> 02:16:16,457
[SPEAKER_10]: And Medford has areas that are ripe for development, but it should be development that we deem necessary.

1746
02:16:16,957 --> 02:16:18,138
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I would encourage

1747
02:16:19,161 --> 02:16:21,442
[SPEAKER_10]: this council to continue to move forward.

1748
02:16:22,282 --> 02:16:30,044
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would put forth for your consideration that we have a great deal of subject matter expertise within our city limits.

1749
02:16:30,124 --> 02:16:35,385
[SPEAKER_10]: There are many people who are very passionate about this specific topic and have good visions.

1750
02:16:35,445 --> 02:16:36,666
[SPEAKER_10]: I've talked with some of them.

1751
02:16:37,186 --> 02:16:38,506
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard of some of them.

1752
02:16:38,686 --> 02:16:48,549
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that we have committees for Walk Medford, Bike Medford, the arts, but we do not have a citizen representation.

1753
02:16:49,205 --> 02:16:53,206
[SPEAKER_10]: for development, which is the critical thing for our city.

1754
02:16:53,686 --> 02:17:07,108
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really think that that's one thing that's lacking because a good and meaningful committee or coalition of Medford residents with some subject matter expertise can help you in that, you know, and bring to bear.

1755
02:17:07,328 --> 02:17:10,089
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a big undertaking, but I'm glad to see it.

1756
02:17:10,589 --> 02:17:17,210
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I would stress that in my mind and in my opinion, it is one of the most crucial things

1757
02:17:18,088 --> 02:17:35,091
[SPEAKER_10]: the crucial contracts that you have between your constituents, that you're going to, you know, look to protect the interest of the Medford residents, recognizing that developers coming in are buying and they're property owners, but they're not the same type of property owners that are going to be here and stay here.

1758
02:17:35,131 --> 02:17:39,992
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to turn the property around and make their profit and usually leave.

1759
02:17:40,072 --> 02:17:41,792
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I'm very encouraged to see it.

1760
02:17:41,832 --> 02:17:46,373
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the positive thoughts and I hope that we continue in this forward movement.

1761
02:17:48,413 --> 02:17:48,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

1762
02:17:49,774 --> 02:17:50,234
[SPEAKER_07]: I yield as well.

1763
02:17:50,274 --> 02:17:53,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco yields to a gentleman from East Medford.

1764
02:17:56,479 --> 02:17:57,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Council President.

1765
02:17:58,401 --> 02:17:59,422
[SPEAKER_12]: Name and address of the record, please.

1766
02:17:59,502 --> 02:18:01,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Andrew Castagnetti, Medford.

1767
02:18:03,485 --> 02:18:06,547
[SPEAKER_12]: Good development, I believe, most of the time is very good.

1768
02:18:08,268 --> 02:18:11,491
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just that, how was this now?

1769
02:18:11,611 --> 02:18:12,652
[SPEAKER_12]: How was I going to present this?

1770
02:18:15,433 --> 02:18:22,236
[SPEAKER_12]: especially if it's mixed use, a la station landing, because that's how the Roman Empire did business way back.

1771
02:18:23,016 --> 02:18:31,580
[SPEAKER_12]: If you lived here, if you worked here, you could eat downstairs, you didn't even need a bicycle, for God's sakes, in the T's there.

1772
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:34,981
[SPEAKER_12]: It'd be nice to have one in Method Square someday also.

1773
02:18:35,681 --> 02:18:36,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Might as well get that in there again.

1774
02:18:38,823 --> 02:18:43,825
[SPEAKER_12]: Council President, however, when the new growth

1775
02:18:45,687 --> 02:18:57,893
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the new real estate taxes from these brand new developments that grow out of ground are not applied to offset the prop two and a half increases.

1776
02:18:59,274 --> 02:19:05,937
[SPEAKER_12]: This new growth doesn't help the taxpayer at all that pays real estate taxes.

1777
02:19:06,378 --> 02:19:14,682
[SPEAKER_12]: It hurts us because we have to get more schools, more teachers, more police, more fire.

1778
02:19:16,577 --> 02:19:17,358
[SPEAKER_12]: infrastructure.

1779
02:19:19,299 --> 02:19:21,881
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't see how it helps us.

1780
02:19:22,382 --> 02:19:35,772
[SPEAKER_12]: As a matter of fact, it hurts us because the following year to the $100 million tax levy, they add the new growth, the 1.7 million, and then the two, prop two and a half, another two and a half million on top.

1781
02:19:36,272 --> 02:19:38,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Then they take two and a half percent of that greater number.

1782
02:19:39,575 --> 02:19:43,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, it's like the Russian lady used to say here 15, 20 years ago.

1783
02:19:43,396 --> 02:19:50,937
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like an annuity that keeps on giving, but at the cost of the real estate taxpayers here.

1784
02:19:54,818 --> 02:19:59,338
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd like to see the city to be a hopping place, because the location is strategic.

1785
02:19:59,398 --> 02:20:03,379
[SPEAKER_12]: It's probably the best in all of Massachusetts, proximity to Boston.

1786
02:20:03,839 --> 02:20:04,859
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of open space.

1787
02:20:04,919 --> 02:20:06,980
[SPEAKER_12]: We're being jammed in in East Medford.

1788
02:20:10,051 --> 02:20:12,692
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure, maybe we should secede from the city.

1789
02:20:15,312 --> 02:20:16,752
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a capital idea, possibly.

1790
02:20:16,872 --> 02:20:18,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Marks, you lived it yourself.

1791
02:20:19,773 --> 02:20:23,114
[SPEAKER_12]: West Medford can stay with Winchester, with your own zip code, by the way.

1792
02:20:25,194 --> 02:20:28,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that's okay, because who's gonna pay for their services, the squeaky wheels?

1793
02:20:29,095 --> 02:20:31,936
[SPEAKER_12]: The salt won't be able to pay anymore if West Medford secedes.

1794
02:20:32,216 --> 02:20:32,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Good luck.

1795
02:20:33,276 --> 02:20:37,277
[SPEAKER_12]: You get all the money, but we have the territory.

1796
02:20:38,266 --> 02:20:44,851
[SPEAKER_12]: From Route 93 all the way to Fells Lake, this is like Donald Trump land, very valuable.

1797
02:20:45,311 --> 02:20:49,114
[SPEAKER_12]: If you ever have one of the two fires Chelsea ever had, hang on to your land.

1798
02:20:50,335 --> 02:20:51,255
[SPEAKER_12]: I like new growth.

1799
02:20:52,416 --> 02:21:02,824
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you don't use the real estate taxes, and by the way, who says you have to raise real estate taxes $1 or actually $2.5 million at 2.5% of last year's $100 million levy?

1800
02:21:08,595 --> 02:21:10,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a law that says you have to?

1801
02:21:11,558 --> 02:21:12,699
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Briana.

1802
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:14,460
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew I liked you.

1803
02:21:15,101 --> 02:21:15,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for listening.

1804
02:21:16,582 --> 02:21:16,922
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1805
02:21:17,002 --> 02:21:17,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Falco.

1806
02:21:18,063 --> 02:21:18,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1807
02:21:19,124 --> 02:21:23,028
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing this forward tonight.

1808
02:21:23,588 --> 02:21:25,230
[SPEAKER_15]: I fully support the resolution.

1809
02:21:25,250 --> 02:21:30,594
[SPEAKER_15]: I have been pretty vocal about zoning since I've been on this council.

1810
02:21:31,055 --> 02:21:33,477
[SPEAKER_15]: And I made a resolution a year ago.

1811
02:21:34,308 --> 02:21:45,742
[SPEAKER_15]: The resolution is still in subcommittee, but I still firmly believe that we need to hire someone from the outside to come in and look at zoning in every neighborhood throughout this city.

1812
02:21:47,264 --> 02:21:51,329
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand going street by street, but every neighborhood needs to be looked at.

1813
02:21:53,028 --> 02:21:58,532
[SPEAKER_15]: It probably is the most important responsibility that we have, zoning as a board.

1814
02:21:58,592 --> 02:22:01,013
[SPEAKER_15]: That is one of our most important responsibilities.

1815
02:22:01,053 --> 02:22:02,054
[SPEAKER_15]: This needs to be looked at.

1816
02:22:02,074 --> 02:22:04,075
[SPEAKER_15]: It needs to be looked at sooner than later.

1817
02:22:04,155 --> 02:22:07,277
[SPEAKER_15]: I firmly believe that we need to bring in someone from the outside.

1818
02:22:07,317 --> 02:22:07,858
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll say it again.

1819
02:22:08,138 --> 02:22:12,100
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no one behind this reel that is qualified to look at zoning.

1820
02:22:13,521 --> 02:22:15,002
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we need an expert opinion on this.

1821
02:22:15,022 --> 02:22:16,383
[SPEAKER_15]: You talk about balanced zoning.

1822
02:22:17,043 --> 02:22:21,306
[SPEAKER_15]: You talk about different neighborhoods, residential versus commercial.

1823
02:22:22,851 --> 02:22:28,395
[SPEAKER_15]: the changes that are made, or the lack of changes that are made, really affect and impact the fabric of each neighborhood.

1824
02:22:29,156 --> 02:22:38,002
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want to just go on record, I do support this, but I also do think that we need to meet to address this and to bring in someone from the outside to look at this even further.

1825
02:22:38,182 --> 02:22:38,522
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1826
02:22:39,183 --> 02:22:39,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1827
02:22:41,204 --> 02:22:42,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1828
02:22:42,785 --> 02:22:44,206
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1829
02:22:44,446 --> 02:22:46,208
[SPEAKER_16]: I, too, have

1830
02:22:47,289 --> 02:22:51,652
[SPEAKER_16]: have pushed for different avenues to oversee and review our zoning.

1831
02:22:52,213 --> 02:22:53,334
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll say it again.

1832
02:22:53,354 --> 02:23:12,488
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the mayor mentioned it at her State of the City and reaching out to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council and getting their immediate sit down and set a plan with the city and the stakeholders to make sure that we could do what's right for our community and our vision.

1833
02:23:12,808 --> 02:23:15,830
[SPEAKER_16]: As Mr. McKillop said, Medford is the jewel.

1834
02:23:15,890 --> 02:23:16,411
[SPEAKER_16]: It's our term.

1835
02:23:17,037 --> 02:23:23,629
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we have the Chevalier, we have the Mystic, we have the Fells, 93, Mystic Ave.

1836
02:23:23,689 --> 02:23:24,851
[SPEAKER_16]: There's so much.

1837
02:23:27,412 --> 02:23:29,472
[SPEAKER_16]: There's so much to plan in those areas.

1838
02:23:29,532 --> 02:23:52,617
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, if we can put an amendment, I appreciate Councilor Long and Kern for putting this in, but reaching out to the mayor and asking them, reaching out again to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council to set a plan in reviewing how we need to even start our process in zoning because things are happening so fast, it's going too fast.

1839
02:23:52,677 --> 02:23:57,318
[SPEAKER_16]: And we need to slow it down so we can all share our vision and what we think Medford

1840
02:23:57,971 --> 02:24:00,092
[SPEAKER_16]: should be and will be in years to come.

1841
02:24:00,132 --> 02:24:01,112
[SPEAKER_16]: So, thank you.

1842
02:24:02,992 --> 02:24:03,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1843
02:24:03,753 --> 02:24:04,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1844
02:24:05,093 --> 02:24:06,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Approval on the paper, Mr. President.

1845
02:24:07,134 --> 02:24:12,315
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Alango-Kern as amended and seconded by Councilor Knight.

1846
02:24:13,355 --> 02:24:14,116
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor.

1847
02:24:14,136 --> 02:24:14,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1848
02:24:15,616 --> 02:24:16,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

1849
02:24:17,937 --> 02:24:19,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to suspend the rules.

1850
02:24:19,157 --> 02:24:21,958
[SPEAKER_05]: We just had a discussion about zoning.

1851
02:24:25,275 --> 02:24:26,976
[SPEAKER_05]: We just had a discussion about zoning.

1852
02:24:27,177 --> 02:24:35,763
[SPEAKER_05]: As I look at the agenda, Mr. President, we have a petition on a similar matter, 17307, a petition by Ms.

1853
02:24:35,783 --> 02:24:37,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Rodriguez, who was just up here speaking.

1854
02:24:38,265 --> 02:24:43,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might be best to continue the discussion on zoning if we have two papers that are similar in nature.

1855
02:24:50,507 --> 02:24:51,647
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address of the record, please.

1856
02:24:52,288 --> 02:24:54,769
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't want to do it now, you can come back when you're not prepared.

1857
02:24:54,949 --> 02:24:55,969
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's totally fine.

1858
02:24:55,989 --> 02:24:56,630
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do it now.

1859
02:24:57,370 --> 02:24:59,471
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Cheryl Rodriguez at 281 Park Street.

1860
02:25:01,392 --> 02:25:05,954
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, I tried not to say exactly what I was going to say for the petition when I came up earlier.

1861
02:25:06,034 --> 02:25:08,615
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I begin, a couple of things.

1862
02:25:08,675 --> 02:25:13,097
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that Councilor Falco wants to slow down and wait for a consultant.

1863
02:25:18,658 --> 02:25:21,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Or no, actually, Councilor Scarpelli slowed slow down.

1864
02:25:21,203 --> 02:25:23,507
[SPEAKER_01]: You said to get a consultant.

1865
02:25:24,129 --> 02:25:27,114
[SPEAKER_01]: And Councilor Scarpelli said to slow down and get the mayor's opinion.

1866
02:25:27,916 --> 02:25:29,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that doesn't help me.

1867
02:25:30,669 --> 02:25:32,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote it down, it's an exact quote.

1868
02:25:32,410 --> 02:25:34,670
[SPEAKER_16]: I did not say, I get the mayor's opinion.

1869
02:25:34,991 --> 02:25:44,914
[SPEAKER_16]: I said the mayor mentioned at a State of the City that we would reach out to the Metropolitan Area Planning Council to get them involved, to start dialogue, to get us moving for zoning in our community.

1870
02:25:44,974 --> 02:25:45,634
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I said.

1871
02:25:45,854 --> 02:25:47,835
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't say to get the administration's opinion?

1872
02:25:47,995 --> 02:25:48,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we roll the tape back?

1873
02:25:48,815 --> 02:25:49,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely not.

1874
02:25:49,255 --> 02:25:49,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I wrote it down.

1875
02:25:49,996 --> 02:25:50,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely not.

1876
02:25:50,596 --> 02:25:54,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of order, Mr. President.

1877
02:25:54,077 --> 02:25:54,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1878
02:25:54,737 --> 02:25:56,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps it would be helpful that

1879
02:25:59,664 --> 02:26:04,519
[SPEAKER_03]: When speaking in the chambers, one ought not to put words in another's mouth.

1880
02:26:05,261 --> 02:26:05,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1881
02:26:06,988 --> 02:26:08,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, if you could proceed.

1882
02:26:08,629 --> 02:26:09,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1883
02:26:09,249 --> 02:26:09,549
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

1884
02:26:10,050 --> 02:26:19,394
[SPEAKER_01]: So either way, either of those courses is not going to help those of us living in the Salem Street area, because we are currently under siege.

1885
02:26:19,775 --> 02:26:29,720
[SPEAKER_01]: The first apartment building is on the block, and the line behind them is stretching all the way from Haines Square to 93, and it's taking a turn down Fountain Street.

1886
02:26:30,400 --> 02:26:31,261
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait a year.

1887
02:26:31,722 --> 02:26:35,025
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait six months for a consultant to come in and go, wow, are you crazy?

1888
02:26:35,065 --> 02:26:35,766
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that.

1889
02:26:36,086 --> 02:26:42,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's already going to be six, 10 buildings already approved and ready to go, because it's apartment zoned.

1890
02:26:42,412 --> 02:26:45,495
[SPEAKER_01]: And all they have to do is say, we'll do three stories, and they're good to go.

1891
02:26:45,636 --> 02:26:46,817
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what the zoning says.

1892
02:26:47,217 --> 02:26:48,478
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an emergency.

1893
02:26:48,759 --> 02:26:49,900
[SPEAKER_01]: This needs to happen now.

1894
02:26:50,340 --> 02:26:53,661
[SPEAKER_01]: The Roberts Elementary School currently has 569 children.

1895
02:26:53,701 --> 02:26:59,464
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to put that into perspective, more than 100 of those students are ELL students that require extra services.

1896
02:26:59,804 --> 02:27:11,128
[SPEAKER_01]: So while the schools are built to hold 600 students, they are not built to hold 600 students where 100 of them need extra services in this and 50 of them need extra services in that, because those are extra spaces.

1897
02:27:11,568 --> 02:27:16,550
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is extremely important to me as I have a third grader in that school.

1898
02:27:16,990 --> 02:27:26,235
[SPEAKER_01]: and the largest third grade in the entire city at five classes and more than 100 students, just in the third grade, not including the ELL, not including the inclusion classes.

1899
02:27:26,695 --> 02:27:29,376
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is very important to me.

1900
02:27:29,416 --> 02:27:30,537
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very personal.

1901
02:27:32,386 --> 02:27:33,266
[SPEAKER_01]: but just to get back.

1902
02:27:34,207 --> 02:27:38,329
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we really need to consider this before we think about waiting for a consultant.

1903
02:27:38,389 --> 02:27:41,691
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the most important things that the city council's in charge of is zoning.

1904
02:27:42,191 --> 02:27:44,792
[SPEAKER_01]: And when zoning is going well, zoning is virtually invisible.

1905
02:27:44,912 --> 02:27:47,654
[SPEAKER_01]: For years, the zoning in Medford was virtually invisible.

1906
02:27:48,174 --> 02:27:57,738
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people went in and they got their decks and they added their extra parking spaces, but all of a sudden, some developers noticed a hole and they came in and they're trying to fill us in.

1907
02:27:58,459 --> 02:28:00,660
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we're paying attention.

1908
02:28:03,350 --> 02:28:06,691
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to look realistically at what these neighborhoods can handle.

1909
02:28:06,991 --> 02:28:14,434
[SPEAKER_01]: When we saw the traffic loads at the meeting that I attended for Salem Street, they recorded more than 1,000 cars per hour going down Salem Street.

1910
02:28:14,854 --> 02:28:15,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that.

1911
02:28:15,494 --> 02:28:16,674
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of cars.

1912
02:28:17,955 --> 02:28:19,995
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times that traffic is backed up.

1913
02:28:20,415 --> 02:28:26,857
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to get to Haines Square over the weekend and the traffic was backed up almost to the Rotary at 93 on just a random Saturday.

1914
02:28:29,463 --> 02:28:31,404
[SPEAKER_01]: The zoning there calls for apartment buildings.

1915
02:28:31,444 --> 02:28:37,368
[SPEAKER_01]: Those apartment buildings can be three stories high and probably between 12 to 15 units.

1916
02:28:37,549 --> 02:28:42,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine them on every plot on Salem Street and the street would just be closed.

1917
02:28:42,672 --> 02:28:44,213
[SPEAKER_01]: The neighborhood would be decimated.

1918
02:28:45,114 --> 02:28:48,496
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what the zoning intends for that area as a whole.

1919
02:28:48,916 --> 02:28:52,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may have been true when they created that zoning.

1920
02:28:52,659 --> 02:28:53,720
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer true.

1921
02:28:54,360 --> 02:28:58,723
[SPEAKER_01]: It's emergent that this council act to change that zoning.

1922
02:28:59,133 --> 02:29:01,835
[SPEAKER_01]: to a more appropriate scenario.

1923
02:29:02,135 --> 02:29:07,580
[SPEAKER_01]: What that scenario is, I can't say, but I can say that it's not apartments up and down Salem Street.

1924
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:12,904
[SPEAKER_01]: We also need to consider the load of those additional residents on our infrastructure.

1925
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:15,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Our police and our fire are understaffed.

1926
02:29:16,246 --> 02:29:18,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Our DPW is understaffed.

1927
02:29:21,934 --> 02:29:26,157
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really need to consider the quality of life also of people that are living in those areas.

1928
02:29:26,497 --> 02:29:28,759
[SPEAKER_01]: What are their expectations when they moved in?

1929
02:29:28,819 --> 02:29:32,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you look at Salem Street, most of those buildings are one story.

1930
02:29:33,302 --> 02:29:36,144
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some two family houses mixed in.

1931
02:29:36,624 --> 02:29:38,986
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of apartment buildings.

1932
02:29:39,206 --> 02:29:40,947
[SPEAKER_01]: More of them are closer to 93.

1933
02:29:41,467 --> 02:29:45,890
[SPEAKER_01]: These are not areas that we think of as high concentrated residences.

1934
02:29:48,658 --> 02:29:55,363
[SPEAKER_01]: basically trying to overcrowd this side of the city if we now target this street to suddenly enact the apartment one zoning.

1935
02:29:56,084 --> 02:30:05,791
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to consider, when we keep the zoning, if our infrastructure needs can meet the expanding population that this zoning allows.

1936
02:30:06,492 --> 02:30:07,272
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say no.

1937
02:30:08,533 --> 02:30:09,814
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't support it.

1938
02:30:10,234 --> 02:30:17,060
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not gonna suddenly be able to add one, five, 10% to our population and

1939
02:30:18,645 --> 02:30:20,706
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to have enough police and fire to support that.

1940
02:30:20,746 --> 02:30:26,108
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it takes several months to train police and fire, but it also takes tax dollars.

1941
02:30:27,189 --> 02:30:42,875
[SPEAKER_01]: While we heard that these new buildings will bring 100,000, or I think Locust Street said they were going to bring a million dollars in new tax revenue, 490 families would bring in an incredible amount of additional needs on the city.

1942
02:30:43,328 --> 02:30:48,870
[SPEAKER_01]: even if they just had a small 10% children, that's almost 50 children added to the school system.

1943
02:30:49,271 --> 02:30:51,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Can our school system handle that burden?

1944
02:30:51,271 --> 02:30:54,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Can our budget handle the additional costs of those students?

1945
02:30:55,433 --> 02:30:59,395
[SPEAKER_01]: So I urge you to immediately look at all the streets that are zoned apartment one.

1946
02:30:59,815 --> 02:31:01,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Salem Street's not the only street.

1947
02:31:01,396 --> 02:31:02,896
[SPEAKER_01]: Fountain Street's not the only street.

1948
02:31:03,297 --> 02:31:05,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there are pockets in other parts of the city.

1949
02:31:06,318 --> 02:31:11,160
[SPEAKER_01]: My map is pretty hard to read out the street names, so I could only pick out the ones that I recognize.

1950
02:31:13,755 --> 02:31:18,839
[SPEAKER_01]: This is coming and this isn't just something that is going to maybe happen.

1951
02:31:18,859 --> 02:31:21,360
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that is actively happening.

1952
02:31:21,841 --> 02:31:26,604
[SPEAKER_01]: People are watching to see if this project at the old break pro is going to be approved.

1953
02:31:27,065 --> 02:31:37,152
[SPEAKER_01]: And while it's great to see something different there as opposed to an abandoned building, we have to consider if the street can handle the load of buildings up and down the street.

1954
02:31:37,652 --> 02:31:38,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that

1955
02:31:40,478 --> 02:31:48,080
[SPEAKER_01]: you will take this seriously and responsibly try to change this zoning as quickly as possible before it's too late.

1956
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:56,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once those buildings are constructed and sitting on those sites, once those children are going up to the high school to enroll in our schools, it's too late.

1957
02:31:58,303 --> 02:31:58,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1958
02:31:59,063 --> 02:31:59,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1959
02:32:01,124 --> 02:32:02,665
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Neistat.

1960
02:32:03,125 --> 02:32:07,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Any zoning change is a process that takes about 180 days, about six months, Mr. President.

1961
02:32:07,106 --> 02:32:07,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1962
02:32:09,311 --> 02:32:11,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

1963
02:32:11,112 --> 02:32:14,534
[SPEAKER_10]: G. Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street, right around the corner from Salem Street.

1964
02:32:14,715 --> 02:32:18,177
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my neighborhood, so I feel doubly strongly about this.

1965
02:32:19,558 --> 02:32:28,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, as far as I can tell from all of the readings and all of my interactions in various cities that are structured similarly,

1966
02:32:29,679 --> 02:32:31,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Zoning starts with the city council.

1967
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:35,702
[SPEAKER_10]: With all respect, I'm disinterested in what the mayor's opinion is.

1968
02:32:36,242 --> 02:32:39,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm disinterested in what the community development's opinion is.

1969
02:32:39,664 --> 02:32:42,885
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm disinterested at some level of what the ZBA's opinion is.

1970
02:32:42,905 --> 02:32:45,486
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the neighborhood that we live in.

1971
02:32:45,826 --> 02:32:47,067
[SPEAKER_10]: We are the residents.

1972
02:32:47,267 --> 02:32:49,068
[SPEAKER_10]: We are the people who will drive by it.

1973
02:32:49,708 --> 02:32:51,569
[SPEAKER_10]: We are the people who will sit in the traffic.

1974
02:32:52,109 --> 02:32:55,731
[SPEAKER_10]: We are the people that as these buildings go up will deal with the power outages.

1975
02:32:55,951 --> 02:33:01,954
[SPEAKER_10]: We just had one not a week ago on Tuesday that was for hours for some people.

1976
02:33:02,635 --> 02:33:09,218
[SPEAKER_10]: It's getting into the shower and not getting proper water supply because we're already getting developed more than we need to be.

1977
02:33:09,818 --> 02:33:11,519
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sewer systems.

1978
02:33:11,599 --> 02:33:12,940
[SPEAKER_10]: It's backing up the streets.

1979
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:18,363
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the fact that when you drive down the streets in our neighborhood, people are cutting through because they're trying to avoid

1980
02:33:19,823 --> 02:33:25,027
[SPEAKER_10]: 93, and with the fast 14, the entire state has learned how to cut through the city of Medford.

1981
02:33:25,648 --> 02:33:35,896
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean, I think that we can't handle the additional volume that we're hearing someone somewhere is envisioning in this neighborhood.

1982
02:33:35,936 --> 02:33:37,257
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it looks like Beirut.

1983
02:33:37,538 --> 02:33:39,419
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like they test missiles around there.

1984
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:41,981
[SPEAKER_10]: The potholes are so big it'll eat a Subaru.

1985
02:33:42,502 --> 02:33:44,824
[SPEAKER_10]: So I get that it's considered somewhat

1986
02:33:45,907 --> 02:33:54,889
[SPEAKER_10]: blighted, although I take exception to that term because it's blighted because it hasn't been cared for properly in budgeting, budgetary planning.

1987
02:33:55,389 --> 02:34:06,012
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think that, you know, having a vision of putting 15, 20 of these down Stalem Street is really going to do anybody any favor.

1988
02:34:06,732 --> 02:34:16,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're going to get into a situation where the people who live in the neighborhood, their properties are going to be devalued because they're not going to be these new buildings.

1989
02:34:16,616 --> 02:34:22,378
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to be dwarfed by these big buildings coming down Salem Street, and we're going to be gentrified out.

1990
02:34:22,698 --> 02:34:25,879
[SPEAKER_10]: People who have been in those neighborhoods for two and three generations.

1991
02:34:26,439 --> 02:34:31,952
[SPEAKER_10]: families that are young and have bought in because they like the neighborhood and they like the small feel of it.

1992
02:34:32,453 --> 02:34:36,322
[SPEAKER_10]: So respectfully, I understand that there are different groups that

1993
02:34:37,551 --> 02:34:47,893
[SPEAKER_10]: have political, optical interests at play, but when it comes nine o'clock at night, they don't put their head on the pillow, you know, in the various areas of the city.

1994
02:34:47,933 --> 02:34:52,974
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just where they live, and I don't see any big circles being drawn around where their houses are.

1995
02:34:53,514 --> 02:34:58,855
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask that you make this a top priority, because they are lining up.

1996
02:34:59,835 --> 02:35:00,995
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a scuttlebutt.

1997
02:35:01,596 --> 02:35:03,796
[SPEAKER_10]: We're starting to see some construction happen.

1998
02:35:04,296 --> 02:35:06,237
[SPEAKER_10]: We started to see a few people apply.

1999
02:35:06,997 --> 02:35:08,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Some, it looks like, are going to get it.

2000
02:35:08,757 --> 02:35:10,038
[SPEAKER_10]: Some looks like they may not.

2001
02:35:10,158 --> 02:35:18,120
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure what the rhyme or reason will be, but it would be very unfortunate to see an area that has some beautiful buildings.

2002
02:35:18,380 --> 02:35:20,541
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the buildings in our neighborhood are quite lovely.

2003
02:35:20,961 --> 02:35:26,025
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, be taken away and have it turn out to look like Main Street in Cambridge.

2004
02:35:26,345 --> 02:35:29,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that there's anything wrong with Main Street in Cambridge, but that was Cambridge's decision.

2005
02:35:30,147 --> 02:35:31,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want it to be a developer's decision.

2006
02:35:32,249 --> 02:35:42,816
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know it's a little bit strong, my commentary, but I feel like our neighbourhood is really on the chopping block very quickly.

2007
02:35:43,413 --> 02:35:46,636
[SPEAKER_10]: And it will go like dominoes if we don't do something about it.

2008
02:35:46,676 --> 02:35:49,358
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would urge you to please consider it.

2009
02:35:49,858 --> 02:35:55,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Because for those of us who live there, it's heartbreaking for us to consider that it might not be there anymore.

2010
02:35:55,022 --> 02:35:55,743
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

2011
02:35:57,024 --> 02:35:57,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2012
02:36:00,587 --> 02:36:03,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place on file.

2013
02:36:03,909 --> 02:36:07,612
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn to revert back to regular business.

2014
02:36:07,632 --> 02:36:11,015
[SPEAKER_07]: 17305, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

2015
02:36:12,693 --> 02:36:26,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the sewer connection fees that are charged by the City of Medford, per lateral, be updated and charged per fixture as our fees have not been updated since 2013 and are due for reassessment.

2016
02:36:27,385 --> 02:36:28,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

2017
02:36:28,906 --> 02:36:30,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

2018
02:36:30,887 --> 02:36:40,535
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a resolution I had on maybe two months ago with regards to connection fees, requesting an update from our city engineer, and she thankfully

2019
02:36:41,080 --> 02:36:42,781
[SPEAKER_14]: I thank her for giving us an update.

2020
02:36:43,161 --> 02:36:45,623
[SPEAKER_14]: She did mention that they are due for a reassessment.

2021
02:36:45,643 --> 02:36:52,928
[SPEAKER_14]: So I ask that we look into, rather than a per lateral fee, we look into a charging per fixture.

2022
02:36:52,968 --> 02:36:58,032
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe our fee amounts are outdated by probably several years.

2023
02:36:58,172 --> 02:37:03,536
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we look at other cities and towns, they're doing it much differently and capturing more revenue than the city of Medford is.

2024
02:37:03,816 --> 02:37:07,679
[SPEAKER_14]: This is just one area that was brought to my attention that I've been looking into.

2025
02:37:07,899 --> 02:37:09,460
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's a good resolve.

2026
02:37:10,243 --> 02:37:13,525
[SPEAKER_14]: can definitely be a start to updating what we need to.

2027
02:37:14,486 --> 02:37:15,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I ask for a roll call vote.

2028
02:37:16,407 --> 02:37:23,172
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Kern, seconded by Councilor Marks, roll call vote has been requested.

2029
02:37:25,974 --> 02:37:26,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Marks.

2030
02:37:27,676 --> 02:37:30,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so I understand, this is a connection fee for new construction you're talking?

2031
02:37:32,139 --> 02:37:33,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Only new construction.

2032
02:37:33,039 --> 02:37:34,180
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2033
02:37:40,261 --> 02:37:42,602
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe a sewer connection fee is for new construction, yes.

2034
02:37:43,842 --> 02:37:59,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, because as part of that paper you offered two months ago, we also asked if the, as a separate, I think it was a paper A or B, that if the water and sewer commissioners were looking at a sewer connection for existing homes.

2035
02:37:59,745 --> 02:38:01,526
[SPEAKER_08]: And we never really got an answer on that.

2036
02:38:01,966 --> 02:38:06,907
[SPEAKER_08]: We got an answer that there is a sewer connection for new construction.

2037
02:38:07,584 --> 02:38:09,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, we can specify that.

2038
02:38:09,604 --> 02:38:28,869
[SPEAKER_14]: This can be for new construction and maybe get an update with regards to any other, if a reassessment is looked at by our city engineer, that we get an update with regards to any other updates or, you know, any other updates or different assessments that she thinks are necessary.

2039
02:38:28,989 --> 02:38:30,749
[SPEAKER_14]: This is just one that I know.

2040
02:38:30,789 --> 02:38:37,371
[SPEAKER_14]: I read the city of Cambridge's ordinance and it's very different than ours and they're capturing a new construction

2041
02:38:38,553 --> 02:38:43,476
[SPEAKER_14]: much more that could go towards our infrastructure needs, especially in those areas that are being developed.

2042
02:38:45,677 --> 02:38:46,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2043
02:38:46,758 --> 02:38:48,478
[SPEAKER_08]: So we amend the paper to say new construction.

2044
02:38:48,498 --> 02:38:48,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

2045
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:52,140
[SPEAKER_07]: As amended.

2046
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:53,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

2047
02:38:54,502 --> 02:38:55,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yes, Mr. President.

2048
02:38:55,522 --> 02:39:06,068
[SPEAKER_05]: I was wondering if the sponsor of the resolution could explain, um, how more revenue was captured by changing the current situation.

2049
02:39:06,975 --> 02:39:14,957
[SPEAKER_05]: and whether or not she spoke with anybody from the Water and Sewer Commission as to whether or not we would be able to actually capture more revenue or whether or not it would be a zero-sum game.

2050
02:39:15,737 --> 02:39:30,641
[SPEAKER_05]: I know these are probably questions that you can't answer offhand, but something that raises a concern because I don't want to see raising fees and costing additional funds to individuals trying to develop certain properties if, in fact, we're not going to see a return on the other end, Mr. President.

2051
02:39:31,806 --> 02:39:39,472
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the purposes of the resolution, I don't feel comfortable dictating to the Water and Sewer Commission what approach they should take.

2052
02:39:39,532 --> 02:39:43,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd feel better having them present to us what our options are and then us making a recommendation.

2053
02:39:46,096 --> 02:39:46,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2054
02:39:47,617 --> 02:39:48,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Langlois-Carran.

2055
02:39:49,038 --> 02:39:52,280
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what we do as a city council is make recommendations anyway.

2056
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:55,622
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a recommendation that this type of fee be added.

2057
02:39:55,742 --> 02:39:59,585
[SPEAKER_14]: I did speak to somebody in the City of Cambridge Engineering Department.

2058
02:40:00,360 --> 02:40:10,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Who did say by charging the per fixture, you do capture much more revenue because it's obviously per fixture versus whatever the per lateral is.

2059
02:40:11,002 --> 02:40:14,002
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it was just one set fee.

2060
02:40:14,062 --> 02:40:16,343
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's $100, the city of Medford charges.

2061
02:40:16,403 --> 02:40:18,823
[SPEAKER_14]: And it sounded to me like it was per project.

2062
02:40:18,883 --> 02:40:24,884
[SPEAKER_14]: So per fixture fee, obviously, if you have a larger project, you have many more fixtures, which you could capture.

2063
02:40:24,984 --> 02:40:28,685
[SPEAKER_14]: And obviously, we have so much need to update our

2064
02:40:29,205 --> 02:40:35,266
[SPEAKER_14]: infrastructure, water and sewer, especially, that I believe this money could go to, obviously, to help with that.

2065
02:40:36,387 --> 02:40:36,707
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2066
02:40:36,727 --> 02:40:38,767
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

2067
02:40:39,067 --> 02:40:42,628
[SPEAKER_17]: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of this board.

2068
02:40:43,388 --> 02:40:50,950
[SPEAKER_17]: I understand the resolution is adopted, but the question I would have is that why would you want to charge somebody

2069
02:40:52,583 --> 02:40:56,545
[SPEAKER_17]: a connection fee, because right now you pay from your house to the middle of the street.

2070
02:40:57,226 --> 02:41:05,190
[SPEAKER_17]: So now you're saying that you connect to the city's lines for water and sewer, for which the city charges you for inflow and outflow of the water going through.

2071
02:41:05,891 --> 02:41:14,496
[SPEAKER_17]: We have over $8.5 million in a surplus account that they can't figure out how and where it should be spent as it relates to infrastructure and water-sewer lines.

2072
02:41:15,400 --> 02:41:23,563
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, if you want to talk about doing that for a commercial piece of property, that's one thing, because they're digging up the street, and there's a linkage fee that's attached to it as it relates to it.

2073
02:41:23,983 --> 02:41:33,386
[SPEAKER_17]: But on single-family homes, two-family homes, or whatever it might be, you're already charging the homeowners, already paying for that hookup from the middle of the street to the house.

2074
02:41:34,127 --> 02:41:37,368
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think what you need is probably a further clarification.

2075
02:41:38,419 --> 02:41:40,020
[SPEAKER_17]: as it relates to where it's going on that.

2076
02:41:40,040 --> 02:41:44,544
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think this begs the question, where are you going with your $8.5 million in the surplus account?

2077
02:41:45,044 --> 02:41:45,965
[SPEAKER_17]: Where's the infrastructure?

2078
02:41:45,985 --> 02:41:48,647
[SPEAKER_17]: Where's the LNI that's taking place in the city?

2079
02:41:48,927 --> 02:41:51,449
[SPEAKER_17]: Where are the projects that have been sitting there that need to be addressed?

2080
02:41:52,410 --> 02:41:58,655
[SPEAKER_17]: Before you start charging another fee, possibly, to the taxpayer in this community, I mean, you've got a CPA tax.

2081
02:41:59,494 --> 02:42:03,016
[SPEAKER_17]: that the state isn't even going to give you a dime back, because they have no money to give it back to you.

2082
02:42:03,656 --> 02:42:09,458
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're technically putting another tax on the Medford resident taxpayer in this community, and they're getting nothing back for it.

2083
02:42:10,139 --> 02:42:14,921
[SPEAKER_17]: But you are charging them, and you don't even have a program set aside for what it's going to be used for.

2084
02:42:15,381 --> 02:42:17,562
[SPEAKER_17]: You've got almost $8.5 million in water and sewer.

2085
02:42:17,582 --> 02:42:20,223
[SPEAKER_17]: You've got close to $9 million in your free cash account.

2086
02:42:21,304 --> 02:42:27,426
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you're talking about building all these new buildings that need to be built, that nothing can take place until after 2022,

2087
02:42:28,823 --> 02:42:31,045
[SPEAKER_17]: going into 2023 to free up the bonds.

2088
02:42:31,465 --> 02:42:32,146
[SPEAKER_17]: So what are you going to do?

2089
02:42:32,166 --> 02:42:33,327
[SPEAKER_17]: Start taking from your free cash?

2090
02:42:34,088 --> 02:42:36,710
[SPEAKER_17]: Or are you going to do an override of two and a half with the taxpayers?

2091
02:42:37,290 --> 02:42:38,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Or are you going to start laying off people?

2092
02:42:39,652 --> 02:42:43,856
[SPEAKER_17]: You just spent $14.4 million to build a new Department of Public Works building.

2093
02:42:44,176 --> 02:42:48,340
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't have enough men to do it, to work it on a daily basis.

2094
02:42:50,856 --> 02:42:56,978
[SPEAKER_17]: The problem that I see, and it's just my opinion, that you folks have got no relationship with this mayor.

2095
02:42:57,579 --> 02:43:02,181
[SPEAKER_17]: You absolutely have nothing to do with her on anything in this city.

2096
02:43:02,261 --> 02:43:05,442
[SPEAKER_17]: She just uses you for whatever she wants, when she wants.

2097
02:43:06,862 --> 02:43:11,444
[SPEAKER_17]: Listen, if this is going to be cohesive and a working relationship, you people need to put your foot down.

2098
02:43:11,484 --> 02:43:12,425
[SPEAKER_17]: It only takes four of you.

2099
02:43:13,145 --> 02:43:18,547
[SPEAKER_17]: Four of you have enough intestinal fortitude to tell the city administration enough is enough.

2100
02:43:19,802 --> 02:43:38,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I'll tell you right now, you folks keep going in this direction, your election this November is going to have a different audience out there and behind this rail, because people are fed up with the fact that they're paying for something, they're not getting it, there's no cooperation, there's no fluidness, there's no transparency, and there's no honesty coming out of this building.

2101
02:43:39,532 --> 02:43:39,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2102
02:43:40,032 --> 02:43:40,392
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2103
02:43:40,412 --> 02:43:43,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

2104
02:43:44,790 --> 02:43:47,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I had a little trouble hearing.

2105
02:43:47,792 --> 02:43:50,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I wondered if I could inquire clarification.

2106
02:43:50,734 --> 02:43:56,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard that there's a linkage fee, but is there a purpose identified for that fee?

2107
02:43:56,377 --> 02:44:03,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it going to go into a City Council account where you guys would be responsible to disburse the funds, or is it just general?

2108
02:44:04,242 --> 02:44:06,483
[SPEAKER_10]: The speakers went out, so I didn't hear.

2109
02:44:06,503 --> 02:44:10,205
[SPEAKER_07]: City Council does not have any of their own private accounts that I know of.

2110
02:44:10,465 --> 02:44:11,806
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just an additional fee?

2111
02:44:12,458 --> 02:44:22,540
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, it would seem like it would make more sense if you had the purview there is Use it for like, you know sidewalks or crosswalks or Whatever.

2112
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:23,120
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

2113
02:44:23,240 --> 02:44:23,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

2114
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:24,260
[SPEAKER_10]: I just didn't hear.

2115
02:44:24,280 --> 02:44:38,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks On the motion by council on current as amended and seconded by councillor mocks roll call vote has been requested His absence

2116
02:44:41,005 --> 02:44:41,905

2123
02:44:48,487 --> 02:44:48,727
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2125
02:44:51,428 --> 02:44:51,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

02:44:52,868 --> 02:44:53,568
[SPEAKER_02]: President Caraviello?

2127
02:44:53,948 --> 02:44:54,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2128

2130
02:45:03,911 --> 02:45:05,111
[SPEAKER_07]: 17.309 offered by Councilor Knight.

2131
02:45:05,611 --> 02:45:08,672
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the administration update the council on the status

2132
02:45:09,243 --> 02:45:12,806
[SPEAKER_07]: of the Community Preservation Act Commission Appointments.

2133
02:45:23,921 --> 02:45:32,266
[SPEAKER_05]: which establishes the Community Preservation Commission, which is required by law in order to execute the goals and objectives of the Community Preservation Act.

2134
02:45:33,467 --> 02:45:40,551
[SPEAKER_05]: The administration opened up a period of applications and that has since closed.

2135
02:45:40,711 --> 02:45:47,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm wondering if she can give us an update as to what the status is of appointing that board so that we can get to work on some good projects in recreation and affordable housing.

2136
02:45:48,534 --> 02:45:52,337
[SPEAKER_05]: open space and historic revitalization, Mr. President.

2137
02:45:52,657 --> 02:45:53,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2138

[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2139

02:45:57,861 --> 02:45:58,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

2141
02:45:59,743 --> 02:46:01,884
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to take hands in the hands of the clerk.

2142
02:46:07,148 --> 02:46:16,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the DPW commissioner update the council regarding the Spring Street sweeping schedule.

2143
02:46:18,235 --> 02:46:18,896
[SPEAKER_07]: It was hard to get out.

2144
02:46:20,557 --> 02:46:21,057
[SPEAKER_05]: It always is.

2145
02:46:21,157 --> 02:46:23,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet streaping, right?

2146
02:46:23,219 --> 02:46:35,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, again, in line with the paper that I offered earlier in the evening, relative to when the striping of sidewalks and roadways, I'm sorry, crosswalks and roadways is going to be performed, I know that every spring we also have our, what's termed the big sweep.

2147
02:46:36,380 --> 02:46:39,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe it's supposed to start relatively soon, weather permitting.

2148
02:46:39,861 --> 02:46:53,846
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping that the DPW commissioner can provide us with a schedule as to when it's going to happen so that we can help get the word out to the residents in the neighborhood so that they're not inconvenienced by any type of notification problems that may occur relative to the street sweeping program.

2149
02:46:54,726 --> 02:46:55,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2150
02:46:55,066 --> 02:46:58,107
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Light, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2151
02:46:59,437 --> 02:47:00,097
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

2152
02:47:01,477 --> 02:47:02,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor, Vice President Marks.

2153
02:47:03,418 --> 02:47:04,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2154
02:47:04,538 --> 02:47:13,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I must say, even though the weather is getting warmer, that the last snowstorm that we had on Tuesday, the plow trucks had gotten many complaints.

2155
02:47:13,800 --> 02:47:15,201
[SPEAKER_08]: They weren't plowing to the curb.

2156
02:47:16,221 --> 02:47:21,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And the next day, the city of Medford removed the restriction of parking on both sides.

2157
02:47:21,922 --> 02:47:25,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And cars were literally parking two or three feet

2158
02:47:26,082 --> 02:47:28,563
[SPEAKER_08]: from the curb itself because it was all snow there.

2159
02:47:29,204 --> 02:47:33,166
[SPEAKER_08]: And trash trucks, emergency vehicles couldn't get down many of the roads.

2160
02:47:33,846 --> 02:47:41,810
[SPEAKER_08]: And it maintains consistently a problem in this community about plowing to the curb.

2161
02:47:42,350 --> 02:47:55,157
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would just ask as part of this paper that we once again ask the administration and the DPW commissioner to make sure that if we're going to have cars be removed from one side or the other, that the trucks plow to the curb.

2162
02:47:55,732 --> 02:47:59,393
[SPEAKER_08]: so the cars have a place to park after the snow emergency is removed.

2163
02:48:01,033 --> 02:48:02,314
[SPEAKER_07]: As amended by Councilor Marks.

2164
02:48:03,674 --> 02:48:04,294
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

2165
02:48:05,174 --> 02:48:06,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

2166
02:48:06,935 --> 02:48:16,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Marks being resolved that the Medford City Council receive an update on the status of the property located at Maple Park Avenue known as

2167
02:48:17,396 --> 02:48:18,637
[SPEAKER_07]: the Hegner Center.

2168
02:48:37,672 --> 02:48:41,616
[SPEAKER_08]: provides services to the disability community.

2169
02:48:42,356 --> 02:48:50,964
[SPEAKER_08]: And this council requested that that property was given to the Hegnon Center for $1 back some many years ago.

2170
02:48:51,404 --> 02:49:03,855
[SPEAKER_08]: And when it changed hands to Bridgewell, and Bridgewell was looking to sell the property, we asked that the city solicitor meet with Bridgewell and state that because it was no longer being utilized for the purpose of the deed,

2171
02:49:04,255 --> 02:49:11,118
[SPEAKER_08]: which said it had to be used for disabilities, that it revert back to the City of Method.

2172
02:49:11,778 --> 02:49:22,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm proud to say that has happened, and there are dumpsters out in front there that are being filled up with items, and residents are concerned with what's taking place in the area.

2173
02:49:22,942 --> 02:49:32,026
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can get an update, I don't know if it's Bridgewell that's cleaning out the building, or if the City of Method is doing something with the building, but if we can get an update, Mr. President,

2174
02:49:32,670 --> 02:49:42,076
[SPEAKER_08]: for next council meeting regarding what is the status of the pharma-hegmas at the site and what's taking place.

2175
02:49:42,417 --> 02:49:42,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2176
02:49:42,877 --> 02:49:48,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I myself have received several phone calls on what was going on in the building because there seemed to be some meetings going on there also.

2177
02:49:49,841 --> 02:49:50,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

2178
02:49:51,022 --> 02:49:51,863
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2179
02:49:52,103 --> 02:49:54,344
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

2180
02:49:54,845 --> 02:49:57,486
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you wouldn't mind an amendment to the resolution.

2181
02:49:57,506 --> 02:49:59,768
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it would be ideal if we could actually have

2182
02:50:01,450 --> 02:50:03,011
[SPEAKER_15]: a tour of the building as a committee.

2183
02:50:03,271 --> 02:50:11,856
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if that building's coming back onto the city rolls, then we should actually go down, take a look at the facility, see what condition it's in.

2184
02:50:11,896 --> 02:50:15,158
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't had it, it hasn't been part of the city amendment for many years.

2185
02:50:15,878 --> 02:50:20,321
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we should really get a firsthand look at the condition of the facility.

2186
02:50:22,182 --> 02:50:26,164
[SPEAKER_15]: So if Councilor Marks wouldn't mind, I'd like to add that as an amendment to the resolution.

2187
02:50:30,146 --> 02:50:31,247
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Council.

2188
02:50:31,670 --> 02:50:37,092
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Falco, and seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2189
02:50:37,152 --> 02:50:37,752
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

2190
02:50:37,772 --> 02:50:37,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

2191
02:50:38,733 --> 02:50:39,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

2192
02:50:41,314 --> 02:50:43,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Petition presentation and similar matters.

2193
02:50:53,839 --> 02:50:59,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, earlier this evening at 6 p.m., the committee of the whole met to discuss two papers in committee.

2194
02:51:00,402 --> 02:51:01,062
[SPEAKER_05]: One paper was

2195
02:51:01,717 --> 02:51:04,159
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, regulating replica firearms in the city of Medford.

2196
02:51:04,199 --> 02:51:17,552
[SPEAKER_05]: That paper was, um, referred to remaining committee with, uh, some opinion from the city solicitor, uh, to take a look at some additional aspects of potentially, uh, regulating the sale of replica firearms in the community as well as recommended by councilor marks.

2197
02:51:18,033 --> 02:51:25,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, there was also a paper that was on the table, Mr. President, that has gone through the legislative process and that paper was related to the wage theft

2198
02:51:26,166 --> 02:51:29,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Ordinance Prevention of Wage Theft in the City of Medford, Mr. President.

2199
02:51:29,629 --> 02:51:31,690
[SPEAKER_05]: That paper was reported out of committee favorably.

2200
02:51:32,711 --> 02:51:36,434
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would move for adoption of the committee report this evening, Mr. President.

2201
02:51:37,034 --> 02:51:40,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And after the adoption of the committee report, I would move to put the paper through first reading.

2202
02:51:41,698 --> 02:51:45,441
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Knight to adopt the paper and let it take its first reading.

2203
02:51:46,782 --> 02:51:47,502
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

2204
02:51:48,063 --> 02:51:48,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

2205
02:51:48,563 --> 02:51:49,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

2206
02:51:50,365 --> 02:51:53,987
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Councilor Knight to let the paper take its first reading.

2207
02:51:54,328 --> 02:51:54,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Clerk.

2208
02:51:55,145 --> 02:51:56,065
[SPEAKER_07]: please call the roll.

2209
02:52:02,986 --> 02:52:03,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Dello Russo?

2210
02:52:04,307 --> 02:52:04,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco?

2211
02:52:05,287 --> 02:52:05,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2212
02:52:06,427 --> 02:52:06,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight?

2213
02:52:07,207 --> 02:52:07,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2214
02:52:08,627 --> 02:52:09,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Kern?

2215
02:52:09,468 --> 02:52:09,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2216
02:52:10,268 --> 02:52:11,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Marks?

2217
02:52:11,348 --> 02:52:11,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2218
02:52:11,908 --> 02:52:12,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scapelli?

2219
02:52:12,848 --> 02:52:13,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2220
02:52:13,888 --> 02:52:14,688
[SPEAKER_02]: President Caraviello?

2221
02:52:14,769 --> 02:52:15,029
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2222
02:52:15,349 --> 02:52:19,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Six in the affirmative, one absent, motion passes and takes its first reading.

2223
02:52:20,530 --> 02:52:22,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Petitions, presentations and similar matters.

2224
02:52:23,798 --> 02:52:31,565
[SPEAKER_07]: 17-306 petition by Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Bedford, to address the council on banners on the city hall.

2225
02:52:32,266 --> 02:52:33,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

2226
02:52:33,807 --> 02:52:35,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Gene Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

2227
02:52:36,269 --> 02:52:43,616
[SPEAKER_00]: If the mayor listens to me on this, she's going to get a lot of hard phone calls and some emails.

2228
02:52:44,897 --> 02:52:47,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, she has started a bad precedent for the city.

2229
02:52:48,132 --> 02:52:58,458
[SPEAKER_00]: While I appreciate the intent of public awareness of certain city-sponsored events, posting them on City Hall's outside wall is an inappropriate place to display such information.

2230
02:52:59,639 --> 02:53:04,122
[SPEAKER_00]: City Hall is the seat of our government, not a billboard for city-wide information.

2231
02:53:05,022 --> 02:53:07,184
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it cheapens the city in a few ways.

2232
02:53:08,104 --> 02:53:12,347
[SPEAKER_00]: One, it unknowingly sets up favorite versus non-favorite groups.

2233
02:53:13,187 --> 02:53:14,228
[SPEAKER_00]: While some are vocal,

2234
02:53:14,902 --> 02:53:24,544
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be other groups that feel intimidated to speak in opposition of the quote, favorite group, which has already attained preference in City Hall.

2235
02:53:25,664 --> 02:53:28,684
[SPEAKER_00]: This unseen bias can create unnecessary resentment.

2236
02:53:29,324 --> 02:53:31,045
[SPEAKER_00]: It can pit one group against the other.

2237
02:53:32,105 --> 02:53:40,586
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, we may have two groups who will oppose each other in concept, wanting to be represented on City Hall, i.e., pro-life versus pro-choice.

2238
02:53:41,527 --> 02:53:42,747
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a dangerous practice.

2239
02:53:44,524 --> 02:53:47,225
[SPEAKER_00]: It detracts from the visual image of the building itself.

2240
02:53:48,065 --> 02:53:51,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Our City Hall was built in a time of magnificent architecture.

2241
02:53:51,867 --> 02:53:53,467
[SPEAKER_00]: The banners detract from the U.S.

2242
02:53:53,507 --> 02:53:57,869
[SPEAKER_00]: flag, which should be the only thing on a person's mind as they pass City Hall.

2243
02:53:58,469 --> 02:54:05,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the MIA flag is there as well, for a reason that you should already also be thinking about.

2244
02:54:06,032 --> 02:54:08,613
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, the banners are distracting to drivers.

2245
02:54:09,813 --> 02:54:13,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Four, and most importantly, it detracts from the true purpose of City Hall.

2246
02:54:14,710 --> 02:54:23,318
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the people's house, the building which holds the right of everyone to enter and express their views in the way that they would like to be governed.

2247
02:54:24,159 --> 02:54:34,108
[SPEAKER_00]: We should revere this building as peoples all around the world would die to have a building such as this, where their voices could be heard, not to be an advertisement space.

2248
02:54:40,917 --> 02:54:45,239
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand why the gay community wanted to see the rainbow flag up on City Hall.

2249
02:54:45,799 --> 02:54:49,400
[SPEAKER_00]: It was simply for affirmation, which is an understandable goal.

2250
02:54:50,220 --> 02:55:00,584
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I am asking the mayor not to put up the flag in June, I feel obligated to make at least three other suggestions to affirm the gay population in Medford.

2251
02:55:01,444 --> 02:55:02,285
[SPEAKER_00]: They are as follows.

2252
02:55:02,905 --> 02:55:08,247
[SPEAKER_00]: We can interview people who are gay on a TV show through the new access station

2253
02:55:09,058 --> 02:55:14,042
[SPEAKER_00]: We can write a book on gays who live in Medford, and I would recommend Carl Seberg to top the list.

2254
02:55:15,443 --> 02:55:19,446
[SPEAKER_00]: We can rent the Chevalier Theater and hold a celebration of gay life through a musical.

2255
02:55:20,266 --> 02:55:26,731
[SPEAKER_00]: We can organize a pizza night for gays at a certain restaurant and invite straights who want to support them, et cetera.

2256
02:55:27,611 --> 02:55:31,234
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that these other avenues will be received in the spirit that I offer them.

2257
02:55:31,955 --> 02:55:37,919
[SPEAKER_00]: If the city would like to sponsor something, they could hold a night at the library in June

2258
02:55:38,333 --> 02:55:41,535
[SPEAKER_00]: where they have readings on gay material or have gay speakers.

2259
02:55:45,698 --> 02:55:50,361
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actually more grassroots methods and require the gay community to advocate for themselves.

2260
02:55:50,781 --> 02:55:56,665
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeing this, it will commit more people to participate in the rest of the community.

2261
02:55:57,045 --> 02:55:59,506
[SPEAKER_00]: And by example, they will lead and be better received.

2262
02:56:00,367 --> 02:56:06,671
[SPEAKER_00]: In conclusion, I am therefore respectfully asking you to take down any and all ads for future events

2263
02:56:07,168 --> 02:56:10,049
[SPEAKER_00]: or community communications.

2264
02:56:10,769 --> 02:56:14,669
[SPEAKER_00]: For they disrespect the purpose and solemnity in which this building deserves.

2265
02:56:15,229 --> 02:56:19,170
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not to say that any of the causes are unworthy of respect.

2266
02:56:19,610 --> 02:56:20,970
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just not the place for it.

2267
02:56:21,390 --> 02:56:22,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for considering my request.

2268
02:56:23,871 --> 02:56:24,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ms.

2269
02:56:24,311 --> 02:56:24,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Martin.

2270
02:56:24,911 --> 02:56:26,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to receive and place on file, Mr. President.

2271
02:56:26,071 --> 02:56:30,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion by Councilor Knight to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2272
02:56:31,352 --> 02:56:31,972
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

2273
02:56:32,912 --> 02:56:33,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion passes.

2274
02:56:35,133 --> 02:56:36,173
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, we have several

2275
02:56:36,746 --> 02:56:37,587
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, condolences.

2276
02:56:37,647 --> 02:56:41,830
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can wait to the end, uh, to do one moment of silence, it'd be appreciated.

2277
02:56:41,850 --> 02:56:55,180
[SPEAKER_07]: 17 three zero eight offered by council of Falco and president Caraviello be resolved at the Medford city council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Elaine board narrow on her recent passing.

2278
02:56:55,640 --> 02:56:56,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

2279
02:56:56,521 --> 02:56:57,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2280
02:56:57,681 --> 02:56:59,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, Elaine board, Nara Palachi was a,

2281
02:57:00,363 --> 02:57:01,143
[SPEAKER_15]: good friend of mine.

2282
02:57:01,203 --> 02:57:03,665
[SPEAKER_15]: She passed away a few weeks ago.

2283
02:57:04,425 --> 02:57:06,126
[SPEAKER_15]: She lived in Medford most of her life.

2284
02:57:07,386 --> 02:57:13,029
[SPEAKER_15]: She was a teacher for more than 30 years at the Lincoln Junior High School and at the McGlynn School as well.

2285
02:57:14,750 --> 02:57:17,571
[SPEAKER_15]: She was just a very friendly, outgoing person.

2286
02:57:17,631 --> 02:57:18,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone loved her.

2287
02:57:19,432 --> 02:57:26,655
[SPEAKER_15]: She actually won the Teacher of the Year award from the state of Massachusetts in World History and I believe Ancient History.

2288
02:57:27,874 --> 02:57:30,596
[SPEAKER_15]: And she'll be missed.

2289
02:57:30,656 --> 02:57:34,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Thoughts and prayers go out to her husband, Eric, and their family.

2290
02:57:35,038 --> 02:57:35,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

2291
02:57:36,039 --> 02:57:39,081
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, too, have known Elaine and her family.

2292
02:57:39,141 --> 02:57:41,482
[SPEAKER_07]: Our kids grew up together and did many things together.

2293
02:57:41,542 --> 02:57:43,863
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was sad to see her pass.

2294
02:57:47,245 --> 02:57:48,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record.

2295
02:57:48,486 --> 02:57:50,607
[SPEAKER_12]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushing Street.

2296
02:57:51,247 --> 02:57:52,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

2297
02:57:53,523 --> 02:57:54,704
[SPEAKER_12]: I knew Elaine Bordenaro.

2298
02:57:54,784 --> 02:57:57,765
[SPEAKER_12]: I think her name was Elaine Carrier back at high school when I knew her.

2299
02:57:59,126 --> 02:58:00,386
[SPEAKER_12]: And great person.

2300
02:58:01,527 --> 02:58:10,631
[SPEAKER_12]: And she ended up marrying one of the top five friends I ever had in my life, truest gentleman of all time, Michael Bordenaro, back in the 70s.

2301
02:58:10,691 --> 02:58:17,794
[SPEAKER_12]: And I remember going down to Michael's house when we were engaged, and he would be playing Emerson Lake and Pablo on the organ.

2302
02:58:18,254 --> 02:58:21,596
[SPEAKER_12]: And although he was educated at Berklee School of Music,

2303
02:58:22,713 --> 02:58:26,535
[SPEAKER_12]: And unfortunately, he passed away more than 25 years ago.

2304
02:58:27,655 --> 02:58:35,619
[SPEAKER_12]: And she was fortunate, and also her present husband was fortunate to meet each other, Eric.

2305
02:58:36,659 --> 02:58:37,920
[SPEAKER_12]: He's also a great person.

2306
02:58:38,540 --> 02:58:50,765
[SPEAKER_12]: And as I said at the wake to Elaine's daughter, Christine, and her brother, the children were very lucky to have three of the greatest parents that ever parented.

2307
02:58:51,626 --> 02:58:52,006
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2308
02:58:52,547 --> 02:58:53,528
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish him all the best.

2309
02:58:53,688 --> 02:58:53,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2310
02:58:54,128 --> 02:58:56,109
[SPEAKER_07]: He was very fortunate to have two very good husbands.

2311
02:58:56,129 --> 02:58:56,689
[SPEAKER_07]: You are correct.

2312
02:58:56,989 --> 02:58:57,850
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, incredible.

2313
02:58:58,730 --> 02:59:00,631
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2314
02:59:00,651 --> 02:59:08,676
[SPEAKER_07]: 17-310 offered by President Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its condolences to the family of Captain Joseph Conway in his recent passing.

2315
02:59:09,176 --> 02:59:13,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Captain Conway was a member of the Medford Police Department for 35 years.

2316
02:59:13,639 --> 02:59:17,241
[SPEAKER_07]: He was a Navy veteran who served his country in World War II.

2317
02:59:18,061 --> 02:59:20,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, another World War II veteran that's passed on.

2318
02:59:22,400 --> 02:59:29,925
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I say I knew him, and again, community will be sadly missed.

2319
02:59:31,326 --> 02:59:43,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a moment of silence for longtime Methodist resident Steve Honeycutt on his recent passing.

2320
02:59:44,776 --> 02:59:45,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Marks.

2321
02:59:46,797 --> 02:59:48,258
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2322
02:59:48,578 --> 02:59:52,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sad to say that a good friend of mine

2323
02:59:52,893 --> 02:59:55,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Steve Honeycutt passed away just recently.

2324
02:59:56,114 --> 03:00:07,857
[SPEAKER_08]: For any of us that know Steve, he was always around the community, served on the Disability Commission for a number of years, and was Method's disability monitor for a number of years.

2325
03:00:08,758 --> 03:00:20,661
[SPEAKER_08]: And Steve was just an all-around good guy, someone you could talk sports, politics, electrical, because he was an electrician, and just a great guy, great family man.

2326
03:00:21,342 --> 03:00:23,403
[SPEAKER_08]: And he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

2327
03:00:23,423 --> 03:00:23,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2328
03:00:25,023 --> 03:00:26,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Another colleague in the community going.

2329
03:00:28,224 --> 03:00:28,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

2330
03:00:29,264 --> 03:00:29,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2331
03:00:29,704 --> 03:00:32,845
[SPEAKER_14]: I wasn't aware that Steve passed away.

2332
03:00:32,865 --> 03:00:36,906
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say I served with him on the Disability Commission for a number of years.

2333
03:00:36,986 --> 03:00:42,448
[SPEAKER_14]: And he was such a great man and a great advocate for people with disabilities.

2334
03:00:42,548 --> 03:00:43,928
[SPEAKER_14]: And he will be sorely missed.

2335
03:00:45,389 --> 03:00:45,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2336
03:00:48,050 --> 03:00:49,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

2337
03:00:50,018 --> 03:00:56,180
[SPEAKER_07]: be resolved that a moment of silence be held for long-time Method resident, Jane Cangiano, on her recent passing.

2338
03:00:56,980 --> 03:00:57,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

2339
03:00:58,961 --> 03:00:59,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2340
03:00:59,841 --> 03:01:02,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it's lifelong Method resident.

2341
03:01:02,322 --> 03:01:09,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I might have wrote it down wrong, but Jane lived in the city, born and brought up here, went to school here, and was a nurse for many years.

2342
03:01:10,325 --> 03:01:12,605
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a very active member of her parish.

2343
03:01:13,246 --> 03:01:16,927
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a loving wife, mother, grandmother,

2344
03:01:17,848 --> 03:01:21,211
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, she will be sorely missed by her family, Mr. President.

2345
03:01:22,412 --> 03:01:22,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2346

[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Mox.

2348
03:01:37,985 --> 03:01:39,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2349
03:01:39,366 --> 03:01:41,087
[SPEAKER_08]: This was a real tough week for Method.

2350
03:01:41,607 --> 03:01:44,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Norma was a staple in this community for many years.

2351
03:01:44,986 --> 03:01:51,372
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone know the Andres, they used to own the movie theater in the square back some many, many years ago.

2352
03:01:52,132 --> 03:01:59,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And Norma and her late husband, Frank, shared life for 70 years together, 70 years married.

2353
03:02:00,119 --> 03:02:02,922
[SPEAKER_08]: And her focus was always on her family.

2354
03:02:03,643 --> 03:02:07,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Anytime you saw her, she'd talk about the grandkids or her son.

2355
03:02:07,726 --> 03:02:11,850
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, everything was family oriented and, again,

2356
03:02:12,705 --> 03:02:15,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Truly a remarkable woman, and she'll be sorely missed, Mr. President.

2357
03:02:16,166 --> 03:02:16,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I agree.

2358
03:02:16,667 --> 03:02:18,887
[SPEAKER_07]: The Andre family, a good family in the city of Medford.

2359
03:02:19,208 --> 03:02:21,729
[SPEAKER_07]: We all rise for a moment of silence, please.

2360
03:02:21,929 --> 03:02:22,889
[SPEAKER_07]: These great Medford people.

2361
03:02:29,832 --> 03:02:30,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2362
03:02:33,253 --> 03:02:36,314
[SPEAKER_07]: The records of the meeting of March 7th, 2017 were passed to Council of

2363
03:02:40,219 --> 03:02:48,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you investigated those records and how have you found them?

2364
03:02:48,245 --> 03:02:51,708
[SPEAKER_14]: I have two amendments to the records and I have written them down.

2365
03:02:51,728 --> 03:02:52,609
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll give them to the clerk.

2366
03:02:52,809 --> 03:02:55,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, I move approval with these two changes.

2367
03:02:55,991 --> 03:02:58,754
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion by Council, I'd like to adjourn.
