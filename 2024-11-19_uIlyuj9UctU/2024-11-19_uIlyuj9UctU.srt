1
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,453
[SPEAKER_07]: The eighth regular meeting in the Medford City Council will now come to order.

2
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

3
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:49,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Presence.

4
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:52,599
[SPEAKER_05]: All seven members are present.

5
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,963
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time, I would ask everyone to please rise to salute the flag.

6
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:14,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

7
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:22,983
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Consul Knight to suspend the rules, seconded by Consul of Beers.

8
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:24,345
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

9
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:25,786
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

10
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:26,687
[SPEAKER_07]: The rules are suspended.

11
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:27,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Consul of Knight.

12
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:31,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much and thank you to my council colleagues for entertaining the motion.

13
00:08:31,562 --> 00:08:40,785
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason that I asked to suspend the rules this evening is because we have the Mattarese family here who would like to make a public service announcement relative to Rare Disease Day taking place this Saturday.

14
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:50,367
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point in time, Mr. President, I'd like to ask the Mattareses to come on up and provide us with a little information about Rare Disease Day and this public service announcement.

15
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:51,648
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor.

16
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,188
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could please give us your name.

17
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:55,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I am Megan Mattarese.

18
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:01,145
[SPEAKER_10]: February 29th is Rare Disease Awareness Day.

19
00:09:01,425 --> 00:09:05,529
[SPEAKER_10]: There are over 7,000 rare diseases and my sister Emily has one of them.

20
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,351
[SPEAKER_10]: She has galactosemia.

21
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:12,216
[SPEAKER_10]: Galactosemia is just a big word that means your body can't process any milk products.

22
00:09:12,736 --> 00:09:17,822
[SPEAKER_10]: When you drink milk, it gets broken down into sugars and one of them is galactose.

23
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:22,591
[SPEAKER_10]: The only way you can get galactosemia is if both your parents have the gene.

24
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:29,654
[SPEAKER_10]: When someone is born with galactosemia, that means both their parents have given them their non-active gene, making it active.

25
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:39,018
[SPEAKER_10]: My mom and dad have a one in four chance every time they have a kid, having a kid with galactosemia.

26
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:47,362
[SPEAKER_10]: My sister was born, when my sister was born, she got jaundice, which means her skin looked yellow.

27
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,782
[SPEAKER_10]: and couldn't give her the formula down because the milk in it was making her sick.

28
00:09:56,442 --> 00:09:58,502
[SPEAKER_10]: She had to go back to the hospital for about a week.

29
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:02,643
[SPEAKER_10]: They did a test called PKU.

30
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:08,745
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a blood test they do on all newborn babies, and they did it again on my sister to confirm she had galactosemia.

31
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:12,100
[SPEAKER_10]: My sister had to follow a no-milk diet.

32
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,743
[SPEAKER_10]: If she doesn't follow her diet, the milk sugar will build up in her body and can make her kidneys and liver shut down.

33
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:21,465
[SPEAKER_10]: She can also get cataracts, which is something that affects your eyes.

34
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:26,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone born with glaucoma besides the diet has different complications.

35
00:10:26,947 --> 00:10:29,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Some don't have any, my sister has a lot.

36
00:10:29,569 --> 00:10:35,592
[SPEAKER_10]: She has speech apraxia, which means her mind knows what she wants to say, but doesn't know how to tell her mouth how to say it.

37
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:47,146
[SPEAKER_10]: She has hand tremors, which means her hands will shake, intellectual disabilities, which means even though her body says she's 16, her mind tells her that she's younger.

38
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:54,670
[SPEAKER_10]: She also has some medical problems that she goes to the children's hospital for.

39
00:10:55,831 --> 00:11:02,055
[SPEAKER_10]: The year my sister was born, the chances of being born with glaucoma were one out of 60,000.

40
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:05,197
[SPEAKER_10]: She was the only one born in Massachusetts that year.

41
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Inside of these envelopes is a ribbon.

42
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:16,581
[SPEAKER_10]: I ask you to wear them this Friday and Saturday for people with rare diseases and Emily.

43
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:17,422
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

44
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:18,042
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

45
00:11:31,612 --> 00:11:32,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

46
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:35,435
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to say thank you again and I'll be wearing the ribbon.

47
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:36,436
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for speaking.

48
00:11:37,521 --> 00:11:42,986
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'd also like to make a motion to suspend the rules to take paper 20 There's a number of there are a number of people that number of people to speak.

49
00:11:43,046 --> 00:11:46,249
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, then I'll wish Thank You council appears at this point.

50
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:49,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll call on councillor Scarpelli Thank you

51
00:11:50,987 --> 00:11:56,048
[SPEAKER_13]: Our speaker this evening, I want to thank you because it's the first time I've heard of this rare disease.

52
00:11:56,688 --> 00:12:06,231
[SPEAKER_13]: And your sister is very lucky to have a sister like you to make sure people are educated and learning what she has to deal with every day.

53
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:11,912
[SPEAKER_13]: So, congratulations and thank you for enlightening all of us.

54
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:14,353
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and I will also be wearing the ribbon.

55
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:15,513
[SPEAKER_13]: So, thank you.

56
00:12:16,493 --> 00:12:18,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

57
00:12:18,514 --> 00:12:19,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

58
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:20,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

59
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:32,188
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just like to take a moment to ask Mrs. Mattarese to come up here and explain to us a little bit about what's going on this weekend and the work that she's been able to put in to raise awareness for this rare disease on Rare Disease Day.

60
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:35,710
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some pretty cool stuff going on.

61
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:45,353
[SPEAKER_02]: She's gotten a lot of support from residents here in the community, my colleagues on the school committee, the chief of police, the Boston Celtics, and she's really put a lot of work into it.

62
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:56,396
[SPEAKER_02]: We just sat down and spoke a little bit before the meeting, and I'd just like her to tell everybody about what she's been doing over the past several weeks to get everybody prepared for this, because it's pretty amazing what you've been able to accomplish in such a short time.

63
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,457
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it was just an idea that I had.

64
00:12:59,117 --> 00:13:03,199
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have to really credit to the mayor, because she was the first person that said yes.

65
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:10,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I emailed her and I asked her if she would consider lighting up City Hall for rare disease awareness, and she said sure.

66
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:12,582
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I said, well, what else could I do?

67
00:13:14,423 --> 00:13:19,888
[SPEAKER_11]: It kind of went off on that, so now I have the Zacon Bridge being lit up blue on the 29th.

68
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:22,731
[SPEAKER_11]: The Boston South is going to light up the TD Garden.

69
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:24,853
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm waiting to hear back from the Prudential.

70
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:35,904
[SPEAKER_11]: And there are being over 2,000 ribbons worn from people up at Medford High School to you guys, to the school community, to the chief of police,

71
00:13:37,545 --> 00:13:45,473
[SPEAKER_11]: the fire department and then again I put it out there on Facebook and I was unbelievable from back from that.

72
00:13:46,194 --> 00:13:51,479
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's just a lot and I really thank you all for giving us this chance to share about galactosemia.

73
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:52,740
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

74
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for all the hard work you're putting in to do this.

75
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:02,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello.

76
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

77
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:10,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, I want to thank you for bringing an awareness to everybody about this.

78
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:14,815
[SPEAKER_14]: The city of Bedford, when someone has a problem or an issue, we all band together.

79
00:14:14,855 --> 00:14:18,837
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, you've seen many, many kids that have had problems and things that

80
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:22,710
[SPEAKER_14]: This whole community has come together to help them out.

81
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:32,379
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is another thing, we're fortunate to live in an area that have some of the finest medical facilities in the world to help you with these things.

82
00:14:32,419 --> 00:14:37,024
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, I thank you for bringing this forward and making us all aware of it.

83
00:14:38,185 --> 00:14:39,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

84
00:14:39,366 --> 00:14:40,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morell.

85
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:42,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

86
00:14:42,354 --> 00:14:49,776
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to echo my fellow Councilors and thank the Madaris family for coming out tonight and for doing all those extra steps to make sure our awareness is really raised.

87
00:14:50,216 --> 00:14:57,078
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a proud moment to have someone from our own community doing work that's going to reach so many people and raise awareness for so many people.

88
00:14:57,118 --> 00:14:59,359
[SPEAKER_15]: As I understand, there's 300 million people around the world.

89
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:01,100
[SPEAKER_15]: who are affected by rare diseases.

90
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,561
[SPEAKER_15]: So I appreciate the work you're doing in Medford and around greater Boston to raise awareness.

91
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:11,684
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank you for taking the time to come here and also share the ribbons that I know I'll wear with pride.

92
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:12,224
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

93
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

94
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

95
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:16,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

96
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,422
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank the Matariz family as well.

97
00:15:19,102 --> 00:15:31,627
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we can also recommend that the mayor use the city billboard, which we're allowed to use on 93 to promote this also, this terrible disease or these terrible diseases, Mr. President.

98
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:32,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

99
00:15:32,728 --> 00:15:33,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:43,364
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to thank all my colleagues and thank you for raising awareness to this cause and thank you for all your hard work.

101
00:15:44,065 --> 00:15:49,108
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great to see you putting all this effort into this and to bring awareness to everything.

102
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:53,230
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Council Marks, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

103
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,531
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

104
00:15:54,951 --> 00:15:55,611
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

105
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:56,672
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

110
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:43,917
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Juliette Franks.

111
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:46,602
[SPEAKER_16]: I live at 48 Summer Street, and I'm Ellie hunt.

112
00:16:46,662 --> 00:16:52,051
[SPEAKER_16]: I live at 41 Watson Street We have compiled a presentation that we're going to display on the project.

113
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:52,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh great.

114
00:16:52,852 --> 00:16:53,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

115
00:16:53,393 --> 00:16:54,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's dim the lights

116
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:35,803
Let's see.

117
00:17:35,883 --> 00:17:37,023
What's that?

118
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:39,784
Did it connect?

119
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:41,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Try this.

120
00:17:44,393 --> 00:17:48,876
[SPEAKER_16]: So as we said, I'm Ellie Hunt, and this is Juliette Franks.

121
00:17:49,456 --> 00:17:51,377
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are Medford High School students.

122
00:17:52,217 --> 00:17:57,300
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are part of the CCSR, which is the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility.

123
00:17:57,861 --> 00:18:06,966
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is a club that has allowed us to come up with these ideas on how to better our community and bring them forward to make a difference.

124
00:18:07,406 --> 00:18:10,648
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are trying to ban

125
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:15,443
[SPEAKER_16]: polystyrene, which is commonly known as styrofoam.

126
00:18:17,404 --> 00:18:18,964
[SPEAKER_09]: So a little bit about the petition.

127
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,787
[SPEAKER_09]: I started it in October of this year.

128
00:18:23,807 --> 00:18:27,709
[SPEAKER_09]: That's when I put the petition up and it went live, but a lot of work did go in before that.

129
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,611
[SPEAKER_09]: It is pushing for a citywide ban of foam polystyrene and

130
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:38,867
[SPEAKER_09]: The last we checked the petition there was about 1,016 supporters.

131
00:18:39,928 --> 00:18:44,114
[SPEAKER_09]: We're concerned about the destruction of the environment and then to raise awareness about the health impacts.

132
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:51,425
[SPEAKER_16]: So a list of the supporters as of Friday was sent by email for review.

133
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:54,647
[SPEAKER_16]: So what is styrofoam?

134
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Styrofoam is the name we commonly associate with polystyrene foam.

135
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:13,118
[SPEAKER_16]: Polystyrene is a chemical and way of, it's a material, but it's incredibly harmful for the environment due to how it is created and how it is used and where it ends up.

136
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:23,086
[SPEAKER_16]: So this foam can be up to 95% air, making it incredibly light, yet it is extremely expensive and hard to recycle.

137
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:31,854
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also difficult to recycle, especially when it's used for food service, because if you've ever broken apart styrofoam, you'll notice that it's made of a bunch of very small beads.

138
00:19:32,315 --> 00:19:38,080
[SPEAKER_09]: So when food gets caught in those, it's very difficult for it to wash out, and thus can be considered contaminated when brought to recycling plants.

139
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:49,925
[SPEAKER_09]: So during production, it will release ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons into the air, and it requires petroleum, which is a non-renewable fossil fuel, to produce.

140
00:19:50,366 --> 00:20:00,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So even when it is being produced, it is already polluting the air before even making human contact.

141
00:20:01,475 --> 00:20:06,559
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is contributing to climate change by putting out greenhouse gases.

142
00:20:08,563 --> 00:20:10,847
[SPEAKER_16]: So where does the styrofoam end up?

143
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:18,281
[SPEAKER_16]: The styrofoam has been known to end up in landfills, beaches, oceans, animal stomachs, and food chains.

144
00:20:19,117 --> 00:20:28,782
[SPEAKER_16]: So polystyrene, through this survey, was found to be the fifth, sixth, and seventh largest type of litter from land-based sources found on the U.S.

145
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:34,165
[SPEAKER_16]: coast, which means that the fifth, sixth, and seventh most common thing to wash up on the U.S.

146
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:48,053
[SPEAKER_16]: coast was made out of this polystyrene material, which is crazy that that much of it can be left in our oceans and just washes up on the beach, littering the lands, littering the oceans, and providing

147
00:20:48,593 --> 00:21:05,886
[SPEAKER_16]: harmful things to animals because these animals mistake these little beads and these little pieces of plastic and the styrofoam as food and they start eating it because they can't tell the difference between fish and foam.

148
00:21:06,326 --> 00:21:09,549
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so you'll see in this picture that birds will often use it to nest

149
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,039
[SPEAKER_09]: And it will offer no protection.

150
00:21:12,099 --> 00:21:18,284
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, these birds are not only eating litter, but they're using the styrofoam to nest because they don't know.

151
00:21:18,324 --> 00:21:20,446
[SPEAKER_09]: They think it's part of the environment.

152
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:25,110
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's causing them absolutely no protection and it's killing off animals.

153
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:37,400
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when animals do ingest the styrofoam, it'll block their digestive tracts, meaning anything they eat after ingesting the styrofoam won't digest and they will end up dying of starvation.

154
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:43,402
[SPEAKER_16]: So polystyrene does not biodegrade.

155
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:53,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper, cardboard, any of these plant-based materials, if you leave them outside long enough in the nature, they will break down and become part of the ecosystem.

156
00:21:53,631 --> 00:21:57,274
[SPEAKER_16]: But polystyrene will never biodegrade no matter how long you leave it out there.

157
00:21:57,374 --> 00:22:00,017
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's because of what it is made of and how it is made.

158
00:22:01,207 --> 00:22:11,981
[SPEAKER_16]: So it can take more than 200 years for polystyrene to break down into the little beads, let alone stay in the containers.

159
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:16,647
[SPEAKER_16]: And yet again, it is too expensive to realistically recycle.

160
00:22:18,775 --> 00:22:21,796
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are also a lot of health risks that come with using styrofoam.

161
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:25,577
[SPEAKER_09]: The World Health Organization has classified it as a possible carcinogen.

162
00:22:26,258 --> 00:22:38,582
[SPEAKER_09]: And when food is too hot and is put on styrofoam, it can break down the styrofoam and cause the synthetic chemicals it is made out of to leach into food, which will effectively poison any of your food and hot drinks.

163
00:22:39,062 --> 00:22:44,764
[SPEAKER_09]: So for example, if you get a coffee from Dunkin' Donuts, they will put their drinks into styrofoam cups

164
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:49,729
[SPEAKER_09]: And if those drinks are too hot, there is the possibility of it breaking down the styrofoam.

165
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:55,900
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are here to propose a polystyrene ban.

166
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:03,017
[SPEAKER_16]: In Massachusetts, 46 municipalities have already banned some forms of polystyrene.

167
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:06,621
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of these include Cambridge, Melrose, Somerville, and Winthrop.

168
00:23:07,321 --> 00:23:21,194
[SPEAKER_16]: So many of these communities have banned the retail sale of styrofoam and the food production and they've banned the ability for food to be served on styrofoam.

169
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:26,423
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of the countries that have banned it are up there on the bottom bullet.

170
00:23:26,463 --> 00:23:34,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Jamaica, Belize, the Bahamas, Barbados, Costa Rica, Granada, and Trinidad and Tobago have all banned the use of styrofoam.

171
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:38,807
[SPEAKER_09]: So the solution would be to ban serving prepared food in and on polystyrene.

172
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:42,109
[SPEAKER_09]: So this would include all businesses and schools in Medford.

173
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:52,252
[SPEAKER_09]: The proposed use of trays in Medford would hopefully be the reusable acrylic ones.

174
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:56,472
[SPEAKER_16]: There are other options if that is not.

175
00:23:58,495 --> 00:23:59,235
[SPEAKER_16]: Possible.

176
00:24:00,296 --> 00:24:03,097
[SPEAKER_16]: So this will impact our community.

177
00:24:03,658 --> 00:24:07,740
[SPEAKER_16]: It will make Medford overall a greener and more sustainable place to live in.

178
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:14,203
[SPEAKER_16]: And by making this change, we are paving the way for future generations to live in a healthier, better climate.

179
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:19,366
[SPEAKER_16]: And Dunkin' Donuts, it is not impossible to achieve.

180
00:24:19,806 --> 00:24:25,269
[SPEAKER_16]: Dunkin' Donuts has already said that it has already become polystyrene free.

181
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:27,830
[SPEAKER_16]: And if Dunkin' Donuts can do it, so can we.

182
00:24:29,289 --> 00:24:39,457
[SPEAKER_09]: We genuinely believe that it's our responsibility as a city to, you know, do things to step away from climate change, especially because in the recent years it has become such a big issue.

183
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:49,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, with things like the Green New Deal being talked about, I think that we should, as a city, take steps forward to clean up the earth.

184
00:24:51,003 --> 00:25:16,030
[SPEAKER_16]: So this project and presentation wouldn't have been possible without multiple people, including the CCSR and the funders for the CCSR, Katie Stefani, who helped make this presentation, Michael Skorka, who has been a head advisor, along with Rhetta Smith and Alicia Hunt, who have consulted with us, Andrew Milne, who created inspiration and for this project.

185
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Andrew Milne was my APUSH teacher last year, who really pushed me to pursue this.

186
00:25:21,112 --> 00:25:26,085
[SPEAKER_16]: view the council members for considering this and the community that has come out to support us.

187
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:28,992
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have our sources.

188
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:53,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Great job, nice presentation.

189
00:25:55,516 --> 00:26:00,619
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a number of Councilors that have questions or want to make comments on this, so I'll recognize them right now.

190
00:26:01,539 --> 00:26:02,900
[SPEAKER_07]: The first one, Councilor Bears.

191
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

192
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:06,442
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to thank both of you.

193
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:08,283
[SPEAKER_12]: Is Katie a student as well?

194
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:08,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

195
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:09,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, great.

196
00:26:09,984 --> 00:26:10,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Katie.

197
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:13,866
[SPEAKER_12]: CCSR.

198
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, good job, Katie.

199
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Skorka, who is my homeroom teacher.

200
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:29,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Retta, of course, and Mr. Milton.

201
00:26:30,203 --> 00:26:33,785
[SPEAKER_12]: No offense, Mr. Skorka was my favorite teacher from high school.

202
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:36,906
[SPEAKER_12]: And really, he's one of the reasons I'm here right now.

203
00:26:37,006 --> 00:26:39,467
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to thank you all off the top and everyone else who helped.

204
00:26:41,608 --> 00:26:48,431
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Morell and I worked on a proposed ordinance, which there's language for with the councilors right now.

205
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Addressing a lot of the stuff that's in your presentation.

206
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:57,312
[SPEAKER_12]: It is based on our city's plastic bag ordinance but obviously.

207
00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:00,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Addressing a different topic, but it's based on that structure.

208
00:27:00,402 --> 00:27:03,685
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's something that we've done recently around environmental protection.

209
00:27:04,386 --> 00:27:09,791
[SPEAKER_12]: Provides the same protections around for businesses, you know, if they have an undue hardship, that kind of thing.

210
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:16,077
[SPEAKER_12]: And so it addresses the city as well and businesses in terms of going into effect.

211
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:20,522
[SPEAKER_12]: It would go into effect in 2021, which gives we think enough time for the city.

212
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:28,123
[SPEAKER_12]: And especially the school committee is currently working on a report that would address the costs for the schools and how much that would, what the effects would be there.

213
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:33,084
[SPEAKER_12]: And it really gives time for everyone to adjust and get to a good place.

214
00:27:33,144 --> 00:27:45,027
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted you to know that we took it very seriously, drafted an ordinance, and after everyone speaks, we'd like to move it to a committee of the whole so we can have the conversation to get this on the books.

215
00:27:45,107 --> 00:27:49,948
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you so much, and to everyone who came out tonight as well, and everyone who worked on this.

216
00:27:51,095 --> 00:27:52,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

217
00:27:57,198 --> 00:27:58,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

218
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

219
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:01,420
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all,

220
00:28:03,592 --> 00:28:12,740
[SPEAKER_13]: It takes efforts from young ladies like yourself to come out and have the courage to see something and follow through with it.

221
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:17,404
[SPEAKER_13]: And you could see greatness upon the both of you as you move forward.

222
00:28:17,424 --> 00:28:24,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's tough to even just stand up there right now and to come out and present such an important topic.

223
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,657
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's what, you know, Mr. Trotto, Mr. Skorka do with CCSR.

224
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:32,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that it's something my son loves doing.

225
00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:39,911
[SPEAKER_13]: It's one of the reasons why a lot of kids are staying in Medford High, because they're seeing something that they can actually

226
00:28:40,932 --> 00:28:47,237
[SPEAKER_13]: touch, they can go after and we give them that opportunity to do great things in our community.

227
00:28:47,718 --> 00:28:50,320
[SPEAKER_13]: And I applaud our school system.

228
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,542
[SPEAKER_13]: It's what makes Medford as great as it is.

229
00:28:53,042 --> 00:28:57,666
[SPEAKER_13]: It's programs like this, it's leaders like Mr. Skorka, Mr. Trotto, it's students like yourselves.

230
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:03,491
[SPEAKER_13]: And I applaud my colleagues that have already done the legwork to

231
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:10,158
[SPEAKER_13]: to get the resolution started and move the ordinance forward, and it's something I'll support a thousand percent.

232
00:29:10,178 --> 00:29:12,500
[SPEAKER_13]: So, great job and congratulations.

233
00:29:12,621 --> 00:29:13,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

234
00:29:13,562 --> 00:29:14,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

235
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:16,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morell.

236
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:18,967
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

237
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:22,051
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank you both so much for coming out tonight and putting all the work into this.

238
00:29:22,671 --> 00:29:25,174
[SPEAKER_15]: My life outside this council is I work in sustainability.

239
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:29,868
[SPEAKER_15]: And I had a bunch of points I was going to make, but you guys hit them all in the presentation.

240
00:29:29,928 --> 00:29:31,348
[SPEAKER_15]: So I thank you for doing that.

241
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:38,130
[SPEAKER_15]: In the world of sustainability, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the task at hand.

242
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:44,671
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's why it's so important what you did, things where we can make change, places where we can start.

243
00:29:45,111 --> 00:29:47,291
[SPEAKER_15]: And then hopefully we can go farther from here even as well.

244
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:53,593
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm glad that there is the school, the research going on to see what we can do for a feasible replacement.

245
00:29:53,613 --> 00:29:55,293
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of things to think of when it comes in.

246
00:29:56,232 --> 00:30:02,700
[SPEAKER_15]: To that and I'm so glad that's already moving forward and as you pointed out there We are surrounded by areas that already have bands like this in place.

247
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:15,576
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think for local businesses and stuff like that that would be affected by that the ordinance of course builds in time to find alternatives and then there are these communities around us where businesses are making this work and they can reach out so

248
00:30:16,076 --> 00:30:23,961
[SPEAKER_15]: I thank you so much for taking the initiative to collect those signatures, bring this before the council, and just do such a thorough presentation.

249
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:25,843
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm so happy to support this.

250
00:30:26,243 --> 00:30:26,703
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

251
00:30:27,003 --> 00:30:27,544
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

252
00:30:28,264 --> 00:30:29,865
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

253
00:30:29,985 --> 00:30:30,586
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

254
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for the presentation.

255
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:35,011
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very enlightening.

256
00:30:35,511 --> 00:30:42,233
[SPEAKER_04]: I never realized when I would go out for takeout food and get something in a Styrofoam container, I'd bring it home, and it would taste different.

257
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:49,774
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I know why it tastes different, because the food's probably heating up that Styrofoam, and it's letting off chemicals into my food.

258
00:30:50,214 --> 00:30:51,755
[SPEAKER_04]: That's very enlightening.

259
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:59,857
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I found very interesting, it says that polystyrene showed me an expanded

260
00:31:02,217 --> 00:31:05,619
[SPEAKER_04]: styrofoam, which is a thermoplastic.

261
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:15,064
[SPEAKER_04]: And we use thermoplastic on our crosswalks because it's a very durable substance and it's highly reflective and it's slip resistant.

262
00:31:15,945 --> 00:31:21,948
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's amazing that this also transforms into a styrofoam container that you put your food in.

263
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:27,731
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can see the health effects and a reason why we should probably take a look at this.

264
00:31:28,672 --> 00:31:30,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember my days at the high school.

265
00:31:30,913 --> 00:31:32,975
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't even know who was on the city council.

266
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:40,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we have members of the high school that are putting forward ordinances and creating ordinances in our community.

267
00:31:41,882 --> 00:31:42,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Times have changed.

268
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:53,051
[SPEAKER_04]: And we really appreciate it from the plastic bag to the polystyrene, which I think is another logical step.

269
00:31:54,432 --> 00:31:56,854
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate all the effort that you put into this.

270
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:57,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

271
00:31:57,955 --> 00:31:58,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

272
00:31:58,435 --> 00:31:59,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

273
00:32:02,535 --> 00:32:03,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello.

297
00:33:49,369 --> 00:34:02,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Council night council night made the motion to revert to the regular order of business which was seconded oh Yes, okay while we're under suspension Councilor Marks has a public announcement oh

298
00:34:03,503 --> 00:34:04,504
[SPEAKER_07]: two public announcements.

299
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:05,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

300
00:34:06,165 --> 00:34:07,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Mr. President.

301
00:34:07,826 --> 00:34:30,800
[SPEAKER_04]: I was contacted recently through email by a Medford resident who was concerned about airplane noise over the city of Medford like many other residents and he asked that I use this council forum to reiterate the fact that last year Medford filed over 700 complaints to Massport regarding airplane noise.

302
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:50,569
[SPEAKER_04]: And based on the number of complaints, it's our belief through our representatives, Peter Hauk and Luke Presner, that the more complaints we file with Massport for Medford citizens regarding the noise, that Massport and the FAA may take a longer look at our concerns.

303
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:55,691
[SPEAKER_04]: So he asked me if I could just reiterate the contact numbers at Massport.

304
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:56,972
[SPEAKER_04]: And I told him I'd do so.

305
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:07,980
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone wants to make a complaint to Massport regarding airplane noise by phone, it's 617-561-3333.

306
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:25,333
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to do it online, it's www.massport.com backslash loganairport backslash aboutlogan backslash noise.

307
00:35:27,038 --> 00:35:41,256
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to do it online by Air Noise mobile friendly web, it's an application or a button subscription, it's HTPS double backslash airnoise.io.

308
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:46,139
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are the three ways residents can file a complaint, Mr. President.

309
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:57,447
[SPEAKER_04]: There is that button subscription that I'm not familiar with, but I know Medford residents carried around with them, and when they hear excessive noise, they press a button and it logs in a complaint automatically.

310
00:35:58,347 --> 00:36:04,931
[SPEAKER_04]: And I forget what the app costs it may be ten or fifteen dollars for the year But it's very helpful and the more complaints.

311
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:11,754
[SPEAKER_04]: We log mr. President the more our concerns will be heard by Massport and FAA I appreciate you taking the time off for that.

312
00:36:11,774 --> 00:36:18,078
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you counsel marks the other thing I wanted to mention mr. President briefly and we just had our

313
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:28,429
[SPEAKER_04]: This past Sunday, a community volunteer initiative that started at Medford High School, the main entrance of Medford High School.

314
00:36:28,889 --> 00:36:35,317
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a committee called Medford Beautification Committee, which organized an event this past Sunday from 8 to 4.

315
00:36:36,618 --> 00:36:40,461
[SPEAKER_04]: to paint the front foyer of Medford High School, to spruce it up a little bit.

316
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:43,983
[SPEAKER_04]: The co-chairs are Larry White and Bill Carr Jr.

317
00:36:44,323 --> 00:36:48,766
[SPEAKER_04]: They organized, must have been 75 people that showed up, Mr. President.

318
00:36:49,246 --> 00:36:54,889
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of local volunteers, a lot of businesses, which I'd like to name just a few, Mr. President.

319
00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:00,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's always helpful to let people feel that when they come out and help out,

320
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:05,518
[SPEAKER_04]: that they are involved and they are doing something good to get involved.

321
00:37:05,698 --> 00:37:10,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Lou and John Iantoppa from Iantoppa Painting did tremendous work.

322

326
00:37:33,689 --> 00:37:42,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan Tate, project supervisor for select paints and finishes, donated all the materials and painting stuff for the entire event.

327
00:37:43,757 --> 00:37:48,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I witnessed Mayor Lungo-Koehn painting herself, Mr. President, the stairway.

328
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:49,863
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very tedious work.

329
00:37:50,263 --> 00:37:54,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Superintendent Dr. Maurice-Edouard Vinson was using a roller.

330
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:56,328
[SPEAKER_04]: She seemed to be a master with the roller.

331
00:37:57,068 --> 00:38:00,832
[SPEAKER_04]: School committee members Kathy Kreatz, Melanie McLaughlin, Paul Rousseau,

332
00:38:01,652 --> 00:38:06,075

[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a great day.

335
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:22,566
[SPEAKER_04]: It showed a lot of community pride.

336
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:29,030
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first of many projects that this beautification committee is going to start working on, Mr. President.

337
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:36,097
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all volunteers, it's all donations, and it really was a win-win for the community of Method.

338
00:38:36,377 --> 00:38:37,759
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to thank everyone that showed up.

342
00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:48,790

346
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:19,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I defer to the senior member.

347
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:22,162
[SPEAKER_02]: In age and service.

348
00:39:22,602 --> 00:39:23,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

349
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:29,027
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank the Roach family for their 10 years.

350
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:33,911
[SPEAKER_14]: I was there when they opened up and I was happy to be there when they had their 10th anniversary party that night.

351
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:36,483
[SPEAKER_14]: We had that picture from the first day we were there.

352
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:42,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of us were a lot younger and had different color hair, but it was good to be there.

353
00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:47,714
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, Jeannie's the first to step up when somebody needs something.

354
00:39:48,474 --> 00:39:51,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Anytime there's a party, Jeannie's always there to help.

355
00:39:52,438 --> 00:39:55,922
[SPEAKER_14]: to make a donation with ice cream or help with anything.

356
00:39:55,962 --> 00:40:03,811
[SPEAKER_14]: So here in the family, they're good community citizens and I want to thank them for all the work they do in the community and they'll continue to do in the community.

357
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:05,753
[SPEAKER_14]: So I want to thank them personally.

358
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

359
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:08,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

360
00:40:08,851 --> 00:40:12,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and I certainly echo Councilor Caraviello's sentiments.

361
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:15,913
[SPEAKER_02]: The Roach family are fixtures in West Medford at this point in time.

362
00:40:16,134 --> 00:40:32,800
[SPEAKER_02]: The store's been open for a decade now, but it feels like they've been around for much longer based upon all the community work that they do, the volunteerism, their efforts and work with the Medford Family Network, for example, donating ice cream every year for the Valentine's Day scoop-off being just one of the many events that they participate in.

363
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoops to hope.

364
00:40:34,317 --> 00:40:39,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoops for Hope, Mr. President, they participated in Hoops for Hope, Medford Community Day, the list goes on and on.

365
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime that there's an event that says Medford up front and they need volunteers, Chucky and Ginny are the first people in line to be there.

366
00:40:45,382 --> 00:40:58,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to thank them for all that they do for the community, congratulate them on 10 successful years of business, and wish them 10 successful more years because we really need them in this community and we really need them to continue doing what they've been doing for all this time.

367
00:40:58,108 --> 00:41:02,210
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this matter forward with me.

368
00:41:02,757 --> 00:41:03,857
[SPEAKER_02]: And I move for approval of the paper.

369
00:41:04,598 --> 00:41:06,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

370
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:07,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

371
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilors Caraviello and Knight for bringing this forward.

372
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,761
[SPEAKER_12]: I just couldn't get, I went to school from first grade to 12th grade with Ariana.

373
00:41:16,921 --> 00:41:20,722
[SPEAKER_12]: So we, you know, we've been friends with the Roaches since I was a kid.

374
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:25,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and, uh, I can remember when they opened CB scoops and you know,

375
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:35,690
[SPEAKER_12]: It had been an ice cream shop, but especially at that point, it became a place that we were all excited to go to after, you know, a play or a concert or a game.

376
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:45,515
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a place where young people, and I think it's something, it's a place where young people can go and be together and know, you know, they're safe, they're getting ice cream, it's not, you know, they're not somewhere else.

377
00:41:45,595 --> 00:41:50,057
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's just a great community resource and a great place for young people to go.

378
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:51,638
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's my memory of CB Scoops.

379
00:41:52,478 --> 00:41:56,020
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just think that's a great thing and we need more of it in Medford.

380
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:56,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

381
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:57,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

382
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:58,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

383
00:41:59,166 --> 00:41:59,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

384
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:01,008
[SPEAKER_13]: I've never been there.

385
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:22,263
[SPEAKER_13]: But I will tell you, joking aside, I think that when we grew up, if you were a lifelong resident of Medford, you remember those businesses and those people that showed you what being a Medford Mustang and being from Medford was all about.

386
00:42:22,923 --> 00:42:30,048
[SPEAKER_13]: And unfortunately, in this time, you lose the Tony Luccis of the world, and those businesses move on.

387
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:45,769
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's refreshing to see that my kids have memories of that type of establishment, that you always remember where you came from and you always have a place to go when the doors open welcoming everybody.

388
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,371
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you look at a lot of my

389
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:56,955
[SPEAKER_13]: Our family picture is where John and Gianna would, first day of schools, it would always be sitting at the table at CB Scoops.

390
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:59,017
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's something they still do today.

391
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:10,348
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's refreshing to know that we still have people like the Roaches and businesses like CB Scoops that continue that type of tradition and

392
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:14,191
[SPEAKER_13]: community involvement and give back like they do.

393
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:16,573
[SPEAKER_13]: So I congratulate them in ten more years.

394
00:43:16,753 --> 00:43:22,257
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will do everything I can do in my power to make sure they stay in business.

395
00:43:22,877 --> 00:43:24,459
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you, Mr. President.

396
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

397
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,864
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to say congratulations to- We're going there after the meeting.

398
00:43:31,404 --> 00:43:31,764
[SPEAKER_13]: We're there.

399
00:43:31,844 --> 00:43:32,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody's coming.

400
00:43:33,686 --> 00:43:37,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations to Ginny and Chuckie Roach on their 10th anniversary at CB Scoops.

401
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:39,050
[SPEAKER_07]: We wish them well in the future.

402
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:41,911
[SPEAKER_07]: And we thank you for that continuous commitment to our community.

403
00:43:42,311 --> 00:43:44,752
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

404
00:43:44,912 --> 00:43:45,672
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

405
00:43:45,812 --> 00:43:45,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

406
00:43:46,132 --> 00:43:46,773
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

407
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:50,194
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

408
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:51,434
[SPEAKER_07]: 20-077 offered by Councilor Knight.

409
00:43:51,595 --> 00:44:00,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the City Auditor conduct an audit of Industry Solutions Company to ensure compliance with the wage thefts

410
00:44:02,452 --> 00:44:19,857
[SPEAKER_07]: ordinance and responsible employer ordinance for work being performed at the police headquarters construction project and be it further resolved that the building inspector initiate periodic random inspections of the work being performed in the construction of the police headquarters to ensure quality work.

411
00:44:20,857 --> 00:44:21,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

412
00:44:22,938 --> 00:44:25,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much for bringing this matter forward.

413
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:30,680
[SPEAKER_02]: As many of us have been aware in the community of recent weeks, there's been some picketing

414
00:44:31,393 --> 00:44:40,815
[SPEAKER_02]: over at the police station for work that's being done, an informational picket relative to a sub-bid that was awarded to a contractor that has a work history of shoddy work.

415
00:44:41,795 --> 00:44:49,056
[SPEAKER_02]: The subcontractor, Industry Solutions Company, is performing the mechanical insulation work down at the police station.

416
00:44:49,616 --> 00:44:58,458
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a work history showing that they were at a public work project in the town of Raleigh, where they performed poor workmanship and were thrown off the job, Mr. President, from what I understand.

417
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:09,038
[SPEAKER_02]: So that raises concern and to me because this is a multi multi-million dollar project it's something that we've been waiting on for a long time and we all know that the

418
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:33,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Wrapping of mechanical parts in the mechanical insulation process, as evident by the presentation that was given here last year by Jim Lister from Local 6, Mechanical Insulators Union, shows that if these jobs aren't done properly, they're one of the leading causes for increased energy inefficiencies, but also mold, mildew, bacteria buildup inside your systems, Mr. President.

419
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:50,582
[SPEAKER_02]: With that being said, I think it's very important that we have the city auditor conduct a wage theft analysis as well as a compliance check for our responsible employer ordinance to be sure that we have the appropriate parties that are best trained and

420
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:57,186
[SPEAKER_02]: have a proven track record of utilizing taxpayer dollars in an efficient fashion working at the police station.

421
00:45:57,586 --> 00:46:04,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And that the building commissioner keeps an eye on the work that's being performed down there just to ensure that we're getting the best bang for our buck, Mr. President.

422
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:13,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't bring this measure forward if this employer didn't have a track record, a track record of doing shoddy work on a public work, very similar to this project that's going on right now.

423
00:46:13,949 --> 00:46:15,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ask my council colleagues to support the measure.

424
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

425
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:18,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

426
00:46:19,928 --> 00:46:20,769
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. President.

427
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:30,361
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I strongly support this and I'd also like to amend the paper to see if the building commissioner can get from the general contractor a list of subcontractors and whether or not they are union or non-union.

428
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Council of Bears.

429
00:46:33,788 --> 00:46:34,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

430
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,389
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

431
00:46:36,409 --> 00:46:37,750
[SPEAKER_13]: I thank Councilor Knight.

432
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:49,115
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Councilor Knight has always been there for the working class and making sure that the job is done the right way.

433
00:46:49,135 --> 00:46:54,238
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's a recall that Councilor Knight had

434
00:46:55,702 --> 00:47:18,641
[SPEAKER_13]: these union workers approach us and having conversations with them and talking about what their roles are and having a company that has a shady past working on our buildings right now, especially what we're looking to do here in Medford with both the police station, the library, and as we move forward, hopefully, a fire station.

435
00:47:20,062 --> 00:47:22,784
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope that we have better

436
00:47:24,048 --> 00:47:29,173
[SPEAKER_13]: handle and who the subcontractors are coming in and working.

437
00:47:29,213 --> 00:47:45,089
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that if we can have a list or a verification that these are all approved, if we can, through the building department, that all the subcontractors that are working, I know the reason why

438
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:55,477
[SPEAKER_13]: that this is in the forefront is because we had picketers, but I want to make sure that they're doing their due diligence and approving all of our subcontractors through their company.

439
00:47:55,537 --> 00:48:01,321
[SPEAKER_13]: So if we can have that as a, as a, uh, amendment, that'd be appreciated.

440
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:01,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

441
00:48:01,761 --> 00:48:02,021
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

442
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:02,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli.

443
00:48:03,002 --> 00:48:04,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviellola.

444
00:48:05,804 --> 00:48:09,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I thank council and I for bringing this forward because he's always on top of these, these things here.

445
00:48:10,047 --> 00:48:10,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Um,

446
00:48:11,254 --> 00:48:17,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Similar to we've had other projects, is there a project manager on the job that's watching this, watching over us?

447
00:48:19,258 --> 00:48:28,806
[SPEAKER_14]: I would hope that the project manager is doing his job in making sure that this company is not doing shoddy work on that project there also.

448
00:48:30,067 --> 00:48:31,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we know who that person is?

449
00:48:31,127 --> 00:48:32,408
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we can get a report from him.

450
00:48:32,428 --> 00:48:33,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't we make an amendment?

451
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:42,736
[SPEAKER_14]: If I can amend that to have the project manager report back to us that he's inspected the work and that it's been done in the proper fashion.

452
00:48:48,919 --> 00:48:49,459
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it, thank you.

453
00:48:50,721 --> 00:49:01,789
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Bears and Councilor Scarpelli, we have a resident that would like, and Councilor Caraviello, sorry about that.

454
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:05,392
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could please have your name and address for the record.

455
00:49:06,013 --> 00:49:08,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Carolyn Jones, 32 Arlington Street.

456
00:49:08,555 --> 00:49:17,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been here for a couple of months because I was sick, but I'm back and ready.

457
00:49:17,758 --> 00:49:18,879
[SPEAKER_01]: and rearing to go again.

458
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:19,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome back.

459
00:49:21,221 --> 00:49:28,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been really angry, not so much of you people here, but I don't know how this started.

460
00:49:29,948 --> 00:49:41,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is some wacko people who are putting on a movie and they, I've spoken to the people who live on either side of me.

461
00:49:42,575 --> 00:49:43,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my- Ms.

462
00:49:43,376 --> 00:49:45,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Jones, I apologize for interrupting.

463
00:49:46,998 --> 00:49:53,902
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now we're talking about the employee ordinance and the, let's see, the wage theft ordinance.

464
00:49:54,623 --> 00:50:00,466
[SPEAKER_07]: And so while we're on this topic, it has to relate to this topic per the open meeting law.

465
00:50:00,506 --> 00:50:10,533
[SPEAKER_07]: So do you have a specific statement about this ordinance, or actually this topic that Councilor Knight has brought before us tonight?

466
00:50:11,705 --> 00:50:17,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think to a certain extent, he may be drawn into something like this.

467
00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:20,853
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to be specific to the wage theft ordinance.

468
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:27,559
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's not, we can talk about it or maybe put it on the agenda for next week, but it has to be on the agenda in order for us to speak about it.

469
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:30,614
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't talk off start off.

470
00:50:30,814 --> 00:50:56,963
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the open meeting law is pretty strict about actually what we can talk about and what we can't talk about and we need to this it actually has to be on the Agenda for us to to talk about if you want to if you want to put it on the agenda for next week I recommend that you contact the clerk turn the week you can add it to the agenda, but point of information console night Yeah

471
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:00,407
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

472
00:51:00,547 --> 00:51:10,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe that the petition, the individual would have the right to bring any matter forward that they'd like to discuss at the public participation portion of the meeting, Mr. President.

473
00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:15,310
[SPEAKER_02]: But as of right now, we're dealing with paper number 2077.

474
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,430
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're just about ready for a vote on that.

475
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,491
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, maybe we can take a vote on this.

476
00:51:20,591 --> 00:51:20,891
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ms.

477
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:26,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Jones, if you could, just for two minutes, till we vote on this, then we can go to public participation and then you can,

478
00:51:28,162 --> 00:51:29,503
[SPEAKER_07]: State your concerns, and we'll go from there.

479
00:51:29,603 --> 00:51:36,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that the open meeting law concerns come into play, Mr. President, not with the commentary of the individual, but with the deliberation of the council.

480
00:51:36,448 --> 00:51:36,948
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

481
00:51:36,988 --> 00:51:39,570
[SPEAKER_02]: So we won't be able to deliberate on any of the things that she brings up.

482
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:43,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we choose to do something with it, it would be placed on a future agenda.

483
00:51:43,953 --> 00:51:53,800
[SPEAKER_02]: But the petitioner can't place something on the agenda and then have us act on it under suspension or otherwise, because only a councilor can file a resolution.

484
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:55,401
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

485
00:51:56,118 --> 00:51:56,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

486
00:51:57,339 --> 00:52:04,904
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you could give us two minutes just to vote on this, and then we'll move to public participation, and you can tell us about your issue then.

487
00:52:05,245 --> 00:52:05,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

488
00:52:06,346 --> 00:52:08,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Were there any other further comments on the wage theft ordinance?

489
00:52:08,807 --> 00:52:10,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I call for a roll call, Mr. President?

490
00:52:10,288 --> 00:52:10,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

491
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:18,755
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Bears, Councilor Scarpelli, and Councilor Caraviello.

492
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:21,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

493
00:52:24,247 --> 00:52:28,929
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I mean the affirmative zero and the negative the motion passes

494
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:54,522
[SPEAKER_07]: The run finished business 20-069 petition by Cheryl Rodriguez to address zoning loopholes.

495
00:53:01,606 --> 00:53:03,247
[SPEAKER_07]: Please have your name and address for the record.

496
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, Medford.

497
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:13,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for my absence last week, but I was diagnosed with the flu and I decided to keep it all away from you.

498
00:53:13,812 --> 00:53:14,672
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're welcome.

499
00:53:17,343 --> 00:53:20,210
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I went through the Tamiflu, I am not contagious.

500
00:53:21,353 --> 00:53:21,835
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought.

501
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:26,272
[SPEAKER_00]: hand sanitizer, so.

502
00:53:26,432 --> 00:53:27,733
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to come up and speak.

503
00:53:28,154 --> 00:53:32,057
[SPEAKER_00]: I live next door to the notorious 277 Park Street.

504
00:53:33,198 --> 00:53:40,284
[SPEAKER_00]: That home was purchased by a flipper, and work commenced on Memorial Day weekend, and I've learned a lot about zoning.

505
00:53:40,324 --> 00:53:42,726
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I knew a lot about zoning, but now I know even more.

506
00:53:43,726 --> 00:53:52,554
[SPEAKER_00]: So you won't realize how many loopholes there are in our zoning laws until you have someone break ground on construction next door to you.

507
00:53:54,395 --> 00:53:57,496
[SPEAKER_00]: On that Memorial Day weekend, a dumpster was delivered at 7 a.m.

508
00:53:57,616 --> 00:54:09,721
[SPEAKER_00]: and the first sound we heard was a window being tossed out a hole on a second floor and then the entire contents, walls of that house, floors, everything flung from the second floor window.

509
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:21,525
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just imagine what a dust cloud that is to have that happen for two, three, four months every day because there are no procedures in Medford that require them to mitigate the dust.

510
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:28,850
[SPEAKER_00]: So once they pull the window out, they can just fling things willy-nilly out the window and cover your home in a cloud.

511
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:36,015
[SPEAKER_00]: So your heating and air conditioning filters will be clogged with the construction debris.

512
00:54:36,696 --> 00:54:38,837
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a swimming pool in the backyard,

513
00:54:39,698 --> 00:54:45,883
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't be able to swim in it because you'll never be able to get it clean because there'll be constant debris coming into the pool.

514
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:53,869
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no requirements to notify you that they're going to be flinging debris out the window for months on end.

515
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,933
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot protect your property, you can't protect your vehicle.

516
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:03,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Nails will fly into your driveway, you'll get flat tires.

517
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:09,452
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes on because this is entirely allowed in our zoning.

518
00:55:09,492 --> 00:55:15,975
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no regulation requiring them to mitigate the items that are coming into your yard.

519
00:55:16,935 --> 00:55:33,983
[SPEAKER_00]: So then one day they'll come with a big truck and they'll drop off an excavator because they're going to dig out a foundation behind the house and they'll back the excavator into your fence, knock down the fence, leave your yard entirely exposed, and there's no regulation to require them to

520
00:55:35,117 --> 00:55:36,818
[SPEAKER_00]: fix that fence or put it up.

521
00:55:36,858 --> 00:55:40,480
[SPEAKER_00]: So now your dog is running out into this hole in the ground.

522
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:49,805
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nearly 600 children going to school on your street and they're going, they can go into the hole because it's not required to be fenced off to the public.

523
00:55:50,265 --> 00:55:53,547
[SPEAKER_00]: I know zoning isn't of much interest to Councilor Knight, so he stepped out.

524
00:55:57,305 --> 00:56:08,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else that I found as I tried to go and see the plans for this project that are required to be available for the public to view is that I was told for three months that the plans were out being scanned.

525
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:13,652
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were no copies for me to view to find out what was going to be happening.

526
00:56:14,512 --> 00:56:18,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Next door, they said all they knew was there was some kind of a renovation going on.

527
00:56:19,474 --> 00:56:22,795
[SPEAKER_00]: When it started, they had a permit to do interior demo.

528
00:56:25,357 --> 00:56:34,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I called the building department when two men with sledgehammers were slamming into the porches on the front of the house until the porches fell into the middle of the street.

529
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,481
[SPEAKER_00]: They had an interior non-structural demo permit.

530
00:56:39,861 --> 00:56:42,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone came down around three o'clock, made them stop.

531
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,043
[SPEAKER_00]: By 7 a.m.

532
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:47,864
[SPEAKER_00]: the next morning, the stop work order was gone and work commenced.

533
00:56:48,684 --> 00:56:51,865
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were no plans, so there's no way to find out what it is.

534
00:56:51,905 --> 00:56:54,966
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 20 days to contest the plans, but there were no plans.

535
00:56:56,525 --> 00:56:57,546
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently saw the plans.

536
00:56:57,587 --> 00:56:58,888
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the plans two weeks ago.

537
00:56:59,089 --> 00:57:00,631
[SPEAKER_00]: It took that long to see the plans.

538
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:06,699
[SPEAKER_00]: Even after they said they were done being scanned, they were often unavailable because they were with an inspector.

539
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:11,385
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I wasn't allowed to see them unless an inspector was present.

540
00:57:12,831 --> 00:57:28,277
[SPEAKER_00]: When I finally did see them, it was with the building commissioner, Paul Moki, and I pointed out that the two plans they had, the initial site plan and the current site plan, showed that there's a two-family house on the front of the property.

541
00:57:28,397 --> 00:57:42,322
[SPEAKER_00]: The new site plan showed perhaps a difference of about 10 feet to scale and included a two-family home converted to a single, a two-car garage with two floors of housing above it, and another home in the back.

542
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:53,302
[SPEAKER_00]: So a 160-foot lot has a 105-foot, 34-foot, 9-inch building on it.

543
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:56,304
[SPEAKER_00]: And their paperwork says their lot coverage is 20%.

544
00:57:56,705 --> 00:58:03,970
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the dimensional requirements on our zoning, you're not allowed to build without a variance if you exceed 35%.

545
00:58:06,112 --> 00:58:10,415
[SPEAKER_00]: But mathematically, it's impossible that this home is only at 20% because 160 feet

546
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:23,267
[SPEAKER_00]: 105 feet of that is now house, and it's 30 to 35 feet wide with two driveways.

547
00:58:23,427 --> 00:58:29,871
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to add a second driveway without needing to get any approvals from the neighborhood, and they'll be removing two on-street parking spaces.

548
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:38,402
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was very concerned, and I spoke directly to Paul Moki and asked him why they were allowed to exceed lot coverage.

549
00:58:38,442 --> 00:58:41,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I still haven't gotten updated information on the lot coverage.

550
00:58:41,824 --> 00:58:46,187
[SPEAKER_00]: He went out last Friday before the President's Day weekend and ordered them to stop.

551
00:58:46,207 --> 00:58:47,368
[SPEAKER_00]: He took two measurements.

552
00:58:48,649 --> 00:58:55,834
[SPEAKER_00]: The measurement that they had from the back of their new property was 67 feet, 7 and 3 quarter inches.

553
00:58:56,135 --> 00:58:59,717
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual measurement at the job site was 55 feet.

554
00:59:01,253 --> 00:59:04,018
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, so that was a difference of over 12 and a half feet.

555
00:59:05,019 --> 00:59:08,425
[SPEAKER_00]: The work stopped for a week and then it just started back up again.

556
00:59:09,187 --> 00:59:14,315
[SPEAKER_00]: So some easy things that you can do to help us would be

557
00:59:15,994 --> 00:59:22,899
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone's going to build a house that's two to three times the size of what's already on the property, maybe a site plan review.

558
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,982
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone else could have looked at that math and said, there's no way this is 20%.

559
00:59:28,183 --> 00:59:31,425
[SPEAKER_00]: So this permit should not have been issued.

560
00:59:31,465 --> 00:59:33,007
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have had to go to the ZBA.

561
00:59:33,107 --> 00:59:34,508
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that's already in there.

562
00:59:35,068 --> 00:59:41,553
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could add, you know, so I'm thinking of things you could do quickly to try to improve quality of life, fencing at work zones.

563
00:59:42,707 --> 00:59:48,812
[SPEAKER_00]: If a person or an animal had fallen into that pit, that would be tragic and could easily be avoided.

564
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:50,774
[SPEAKER_00]: This pit was open for several months.

565
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,498
[SPEAKER_00]: It would also be nice to have a timeline.

566
00:59:55,538 --> 01:00:01,042
[SPEAKER_00]: When we call and ask about the timeline, they tell us they can take as long as they want, that they can start work at 7 a.m.

567
01:00:01,122 --> 01:00:01,843
[SPEAKER_00]: every single day.

568
01:00:02,347 --> 01:00:04,790
[SPEAKER_00]: work for one to two hours, stop and not come back.

569
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:13,119
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do complain about one of this gentleman's projects, he will assign someone to just hammer all day long.

570
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:15,962
[SPEAKER_00]: They never need to get another board.

571
01:00:16,022 --> 01:00:21,668
[SPEAKER_00]: They never need to get more nails because their job is just to bang and make noise to punish you for reporting them.

572
01:00:24,135 --> 01:00:28,399
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could have a requirement to maybe mitigate the dust or the debris, I do live there.

573
01:00:28,479 --> 01:00:31,162
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a construction zone for my family.

574
01:00:31,602 --> 01:00:36,627
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been enduring this since May and this home is not near completion.

575
01:00:37,228 --> 01:00:39,590
[SPEAKER_00]: It will probably go through this next summer.

576
01:00:41,091 --> 01:00:49,678
[SPEAKER_00]: Projects of this length of time, it would be nice if maybe Christmas Eve or the day after Thanksgiving, they don't have to start at 7 a.m.

577
01:00:49,718 --> 01:00:54,122
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a limit to how many days they could disrupt the neighborhood in a week.

578
01:00:55,903 --> 01:01:02,369
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're waiting for plans to be scanned, why can I not see the scan now?

579
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:04,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did they scan it to?

580
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:09,382
[SPEAKER_00]: So why can't I see it unless the physical plans are there?

581
01:01:10,442 --> 01:01:17,606
[SPEAKER_00]: I've permanently lost sunlight on the side of my yard, and I've lost the privacy in my yard, and there was no site plan review for that.

582
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:29,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the site plan shows that my yard is still private, the physical building is in my backyard, overlooks my pool, and I no longer have sunlight on that side of my house.

583
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:31,255
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no rights to stop that.

584
01:01:31,315 --> 01:01:35,357
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no rights to view the plans because of the way that the ordinances are written.

585
01:01:38,534 --> 01:01:47,059
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had many conversations with the building inspectors and then they'd scream that and told me that this is a nice guy and he does projects all over the city.

586
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:53,463
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard from other people all over the city that the projects that they have are exceeding 35% lot coverage there.

587
01:01:53,983 --> 01:02:01,168
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is our building department issuing permits that are exceeding our zoning allowances and not making them go to the ZBA?

588
01:02:01,588 --> 01:02:04,310
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing for them to go to the ZBA

589
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:12,273
[SPEAKER_00]: and be granted a variance, even if you disagree with it, you have the chance to be heard and say this project is larger than it's allowed to be.

590
01:02:12,914 --> 01:02:19,917
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's another thing for the projects to just be approved in the building department because they're skipping the variance process.

591
01:02:21,484 --> 01:02:27,312
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most important thing about this is we're not making these sacrifices for affordable units.

592
01:02:27,392 --> 01:02:29,254
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not affordable housing units.

593
01:02:29,655 --> 01:02:34,962
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a two family modest size home that housed two blue collar families.

594
01:02:36,412 --> 01:02:48,922
[SPEAKER_00]: This house was gutted and an additional house was built right in and the flippers promised me that these will be very expensive units and the quality of the neighbors will be extremely high, meaning that they'll be unaffordable for most people.

595
01:02:49,543 --> 01:02:54,948
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna drive up my valuation of my home, but not the actual value of my home.

596
01:02:56,233 --> 01:03:04,056
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get your zoning consultant, you may want to consider that they actually, in Texas, they had a bunch of flippers that were going in there.

597
01:03:04,116 --> 01:03:07,197
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a show, the Joe and Chip Gaines.

598
01:03:07,837 --> 01:03:17,761
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they did was they were increasing the values of the homes so much and pricing the families out of their homes that they created a separate tax rate for those homes.

599
01:03:18,241 --> 01:03:23,223
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those homes were, you'd have a $900,000 house next to a house that was only worth $400,000.

600
01:03:23,683 --> 01:03:34,647
[SPEAKER_00]: And to increase the property value assessment on that home next door without actual being value added to that home was pricing those people out.

601
01:03:34,707 --> 01:03:36,208
[SPEAKER_00]: So they created a separate structure.

602
01:03:36,708 --> 01:03:45,772
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be possibly a tiered option that you could look into that would, if these homes are that much greater in value, that they would bear the burden.

603
01:03:47,972 --> 01:03:53,815
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that there's some way that someone can look into this because I'm hitting the wall.

604
01:03:53,855 --> 01:04:00,438
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just a resident that happens to know a lot about zoning, but this is happening to a lot of people.

605
01:04:00,858 --> 01:04:07,922
[SPEAKER_00]: And the frustration of hitting the wall and seeing that your entire lifestyle is being changed beside you because someone is just

606
01:04:08,482 --> 01:04:10,543
[SPEAKER_00]: building a building that's blotting out the sun.

607
01:04:10,603 --> 01:04:18,786
[SPEAKER_00]: This building is nearly as tall as the apartment buildings being built on Salem Street in a residential neighborhood next to my small single family home.

608
01:04:19,206 --> 01:04:21,187
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was absolutely nothing I could do to stop it.

609
01:04:23,188 --> 01:04:23,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

610
01:04:23,968 --> 01:04:24,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Counsel Marks.

611
01:04:25,369 --> 01:04:26,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

612
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:28,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheryl, I had just a question for you.

613
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:33,152
[SPEAKER_04]: When the building commissioner came out regarding the lot coverage, he has not responded since?

614
01:04:34,668 --> 01:04:47,387
[SPEAKER_00]: The response that I received from him was he called later that day, he called about 12.45 on the Friday of President's Day weekend and said, I've ordered them to stop working and they won't be working again until this is resolved.

615
01:04:48,427 --> 01:04:56,532
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was on the phone with him, he could hear them hammering in the background, and he came out and had someone, Dennis, come out and issue a fine, but I haven't heard back since then.

616
01:04:56,773 --> 01:05:00,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're 100% correct, that should be before the Zoning Board of Appeals.

617
01:05:01,275 --> 01:05:06,859
[SPEAKER_04]: So they should require a variance if what you're stating is correct, and it exceeds the law coverage.

618
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:15,385
[SPEAKER_04]: That does require Zoning Board of Appeals, and also would trigger public hearings, so neighbors would be notified.

619
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's number one.

620
01:05:17,767 --> 01:05:22,270
[SPEAKER_04]: You bring up some great points regarding mitigation for dust, debris, dirt.

621
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:23,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you 1,000%.

622
01:05:24,732 --> 01:05:31,158
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone's working directly next door to you, there's no reason they should be throwing stuff out and impacting your quality of life.

623
01:05:31,578 --> 01:05:35,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they do, they should be able to mitigate it to keep the dust and dirt and debris down and so forth.

624
01:05:36,282 --> 01:05:43,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a great suggestion when we eventually start fine tuning zoning and so forth.

625
01:05:43,285 --> 01:05:47,467
[SPEAKER_04]: The digging or excavating does require fencing off.

626
01:05:47,507 --> 01:05:54,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I just went through something up in North Method where a developer came in, started digging a giant hole, left it there right in the middle of the neighborhood.

627
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I reached out to the building department.

628
01:05:57,211 --> 01:06:03,474
[SPEAKER_04]: They required them to go out and put one of those plastic, you know, four or five foot fences around the perimeter.

629
01:06:03,774 --> 01:06:06,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think that's zoning, I think that's according to building code.

630
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:11,021
[SPEAKER_04]: So they did go out and rectify that, and they should do that with your fence.

631
01:06:11,182 --> 01:06:12,223
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't do that for us.

632
01:06:12,423 --> 01:06:16,867
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure why you didn't call a lawyer if they knocked your fence down, but that's another issue.

633
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:19,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they should be responsible for that.

634
01:06:20,491 --> 01:06:21,492
[SPEAKER_04]: The length of a project.

635
01:06:22,332 --> 01:06:34,907
[SPEAKER_04]: That is an excellent point that you brought up, because there should be some definitive answer when someone comes in and says, I have a request to do x, y, and z on this particular property.

636
01:06:35,327 --> 01:06:36,989
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a permit for a length of time.

637
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:42,174
[SPEAKER_04]: And that length of time shouldn't exceed anything that's longer than a standard period.

638
01:06:42,674 --> 01:06:49,379
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they're doing renovation to the exterior house and that takes three months, it should be expected to be done in three months, not a year and a half.

639
01:06:49,859 --> 01:06:54,083
[SPEAKER_04]: So you shouldn't have to live next to an active construction zone for that length of time.

640
01:06:54,403 --> 01:06:57,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to check into that just to see if there's anything on the books.

641
01:06:57,825 --> 01:07:01,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've driven by that place.

642
01:07:01,548 --> 01:07:03,950
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like the Adams family home.

643
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:04,951
[SPEAKER_04]: It's awful.

644
01:07:06,394 --> 01:07:07,175
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is awful.

645
01:07:08,056 --> 01:07:09,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And what else?

646
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:11,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was it.

647
01:07:11,638 --> 01:07:16,061
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will check into the length of time, and I appreciate your comments on that.

648
01:07:16,081 --> 01:07:20,805
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry you have to go through this, but hopefully Paul Moky will give you some relief.

649
01:07:21,705 --> 01:07:33,754
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other thing that I noticed is that they can close off your entire street and dig a trench in front of your driveway so that you can't leave your driveway, and there's no city requirement to notify you.

650
01:07:34,816 --> 01:07:36,498
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did that for four days.

651
01:07:37,399 --> 01:07:43,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone came out to go to work, there was a hole in front of their driveway, and they were screaming and hollering that they couldn't go to work.

652
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:51,913
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to get a police detail, that was required by law, but notifying us that we'd be unable to access our driveways for four days.

653
01:07:52,854 --> 01:07:54,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Was not required.

654
01:07:54,575 --> 01:08:03,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what wasn't required is they left their equipment on the street in front of a gentleman with a wheelchair's home so that he couldn't get picked up and dropped off in front of his home.

655
01:08:03,657 --> 01:08:05,518
[SPEAKER_00]: That was left there for the weekend as well.

656
01:08:06,618 --> 01:08:10,520
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just little tiny loopholes that you would think would be common sense.

657
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,921
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it saves them a dollar, they're going to avoid doing.

658
01:08:15,001 --> 01:08:17,962
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the city's responsibility for notification of the residents.

659
01:08:18,252 --> 01:08:27,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's not what I was told by the building commissioner's office, so they're either giving me incorrect information, they don't know the proper information, because I went directly to the building commissioner.

660
01:08:27,856 --> 01:08:35,220
[SPEAKER_04]: We should be relying on a private contractor to notify our taxpaying residents whether a city street's going to be closed or not.

661
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:35,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

662
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,862
[SPEAKER_04]: The city street is a city street, and they have to get permission to close the city street.

663
01:08:40,268 --> 01:08:49,818
[SPEAKER_00]: When I asked the building commissioner's office when it was going to stop, if I had to have my husband park on another street for the next couple of days, they said they weren't sure.

664
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:50,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I should probably go over and ask.

665
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:52,401
[SPEAKER_04]: That's unacceptable.

666
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:53,322
[SPEAKER_04]: That's unacceptable.

667
01:08:54,703 --> 01:08:55,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bears.

668
01:08:56,005 --> 01:08:57,907
[SPEAKER_12]: Cheryl, just one question.

669
01:08:58,087 --> 01:09:00,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Have they started working after the fine was issued?

670
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Have they continued work after the fine was issued?

671
01:09:03,585 --> 01:09:13,948
[SPEAKER_00]: The fine was issued after they were told to stop work, they ended up having a fine issued because what they did was they knew it was a long holiday weekend, so they packed up and left and came back when they knew City Hall was closed.

672
01:09:14,388 --> 01:09:14,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Got it.

673
01:09:15,208 --> 01:09:15,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

674
01:09:15,888 --> 01:09:20,009
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the second time they've had a stop work order and violated the stop work order.

675
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:20,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

676
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:29,112
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to say that I also really strongly support looking into different incentives, fees, whatever we can on the flipping so that we aren't essentially having a

677
01:09:30,177 --> 01:09:35,298
[SPEAKER_12]: city ordinance and zoning code that incentivizes people to double the value of a house and displace working people.

678
01:09:35,398 --> 01:09:37,058
[SPEAKER_12]: So, just thank you for bringing that up.

679
01:09:39,379 --> 01:09:40,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

680
01:09:42,219 --> 01:09:42,539
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

681
01:09:43,699 --> 01:09:51,921
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Bears, do you want to receive and place on file?

682
01:09:51,941 --> 01:09:52,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, please.

683
01:09:52,981 --> 01:09:56,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Bears to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Marks.

684
01:09:56,342 --> 01:09:57,082
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

685
01:09:57,242 --> 01:09:57,922
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

686
01:09:58,959 --> 01:10:06,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Papers received and placed on file.

687
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:12,921
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight to take papers in the hands of the clerk.

688
01:10:12,961 --> 01:10:13,642
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

689
01:10:13,782 --> 01:10:14,382
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

690
01:10:14,402 --> 01:10:15,222
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

691
01:10:15,662 --> 01:10:16,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Knight.

692
01:10:16,702 --> 01:10:27,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to suspend the rules for the purpose of canceling the March 3rd City Council meeting in lieu of the Super Tuesday election.

693
01:10:29,132 --> 01:10:34,754
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, that the meeting on March 3rd be canceled.

694
01:10:34,894 --> 01:10:35,614
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

695
01:10:36,094 --> 01:10:36,715
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

696
01:10:36,735 --> 01:10:37,435
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

697
01:10:40,576 --> 01:10:41,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. Jones.

698
01:10:53,241 --> 01:10:54,941
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not Mrs. Jones.

699
01:10:55,541 --> 01:10:55,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

700
01:10:55,741 --> 01:10:56,722
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just Carol and Jim.

701
01:10:56,822 --> 01:10:57,262
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

702
01:10:59,498 --> 01:11:07,802
[SPEAKER_01]: I came here because I wanted to talk about this incident that's been going on now for about four months.

703
01:11:08,823 --> 01:11:10,724
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly when it started.

704
01:11:12,885 --> 01:11:17,668
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a gentleman who was a part of the beginning of starting this.

705
01:11:18,949 --> 01:11:24,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people spoke to him and said that this wasn't appropriate.

706
01:11:25,603 --> 01:11:50,683
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to start an organization where he could get groups of people together and take pictures and talk about the need for going around and telling people in the neighborhood that they needed to do more, to have more done about getting more air coming into the neighborhood, as he described it.

707
01:11:51,764 --> 01:11:53,825
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people sort of ganged up on him.

708
01:11:53,905 --> 01:11:55,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he left.

709
01:11:56,145 --> 01:12:00,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw him one day at the West Medford Community Center.

710
01:12:01,607 --> 01:12:08,109
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said to him, oh, you're the guy who has been having people run through my yard and other people's yards.

711
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:09,689
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, no, no, no.

712
01:12:09,769 --> 01:12:11,109
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, oh, yes, you are.

713
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:16,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And why didn't you talk to people who lived in those houses first?

714
01:12:17,651 --> 01:12:19,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, well, I had something better to do.

715
01:12:19,492 --> 01:12:20,252
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he said.

716
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:22,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that was the case.

717
01:12:23,496 --> 01:12:36,544
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have constantly had people who really can't act, but they're putting in, I think a movie or something, because they've always got these cameras around now.

718
01:12:37,565 --> 01:12:42,568
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've called the police down several times.

719
01:12:44,449 --> 01:12:48,811
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, oh, well, I walked all around your yard and I didn't really see anything.

720
01:12:48,851 --> 01:12:50,973
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, how well did you walk around?

721
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:53,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have shrubbery around part of my house.

722
01:12:53,454 --> 01:12:59,978
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these people, if they see a police car rolling up in front of my house, they roll under the bushes.

723
01:13:00,939 --> 01:13:05,362
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the police walk around and they say, well, I didn't see anybody in the yard.

724
01:13:05,402 --> 01:13:09,465
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, I can walk you around and show you where you can find them.

725
01:13:10,165 --> 01:13:13,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they say, oh, no, no, we can't do that.

726
01:13:13,795 --> 01:13:15,176
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, yeah, you can.

727
01:13:15,256 --> 01:13:21,901
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had, um, two, uh, officers who came out two different times.

728
01:13:22,542 --> 01:13:40,035
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like about the third and fourth who came out to my house and they walked around and they came back and they said, they told these guys, and it was, it was, it was also a few women that this was private property and they couldn't be there and either they leave or they were going to put them in jail.

729
01:13:40,861 --> 01:13:42,962
[SPEAKER_01]: So they left those couple of days.

730
01:13:43,022 --> 01:13:51,886
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next time I had to call the police department because I have really large windows all around my house.

731
01:13:52,186 --> 01:13:54,147
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like more windows than walls.

732
01:13:54,707 --> 01:14:01,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And they walk around and they stand on somebody's shoulder or they try to jump up and look in your house all the time.

733
01:14:02,331 --> 01:14:09,914
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, and when they've had animals with them, what I've done is I've taken moth balls and thrown them out.

734
01:14:11,288 --> 01:14:12,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

735
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:18,254
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally confused by this commentary, but are these teenage kids, young kids in the neighborhood?

736
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:22,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are these people that you're referring to?

737
01:14:22,098 --> 01:14:23,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the same group of people?

738
01:14:23,419 --> 01:14:25,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a random individual that keeps doing it?

739
01:14:25,922 --> 01:14:28,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it different people in the neighborhood that are performing this?

740
01:14:29,853 --> 01:14:35,255
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who I have seen out there are not people that I have seen being people from the neighborhood.

741
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:41,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of the people from the neighborhood have said, like, what can we do to get rid of these people?

742
01:14:42,437 --> 01:14:43,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.

743
01:14:43,897 --> 01:14:44,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're adults.

744
01:14:46,318 --> 01:14:48,759
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have spoken to them.

745
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the same individuals time after time?

746
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it different faces that you see in different times?

747
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,682
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some of them are people you see all the time.

748
01:14:59,627 --> 01:15:03,369
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of them are just sort of new people who come and go.

749
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:11,213
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked out of my window last night, and then again.

750
01:15:11,233 --> 01:15:12,973
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not just kids being kids in the neighborhood.

751
01:15:13,053 --> 01:15:13,614
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not kids at all.

752
01:15:13,634 --> 01:15:13,954
[SPEAKER_01]: They're adults.

753
01:15:13,974 --> 01:15:14,894
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm getting at.

754
01:15:14,934 --> 01:15:18,956
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just kids being kids in the neighborhood playing hide and go seek in your backyard or cutting through your yard to get to the park.

755
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:25,559
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're saying that these are grown adults that have video cameras and that are sitting on people's shoulders and looking in your windows?

756
01:15:25,819 --> 01:15:26,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

757
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:26,960
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.

758
01:15:29,865 --> 01:15:44,208
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have gone out a couple of times and it's just, especially those who are walking around with animals, I would bring out these mothballs and just sort of throw it at them.

759
01:15:44,828 --> 01:15:50,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And the animals didn't like the mothballs and so then they would have to move and then they would come back again later.

760
01:15:51,029 --> 01:15:56,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And one day I came out and I took the hose off and I turned water on them.

761
01:15:57,432 --> 01:16:02,375
[SPEAKER_01]: from that and they left, but they still keep coming back and back again.

762
01:16:02,735 --> 01:16:05,996
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know exactly what can be done to stop them.

763
01:16:06,777 --> 01:16:12,200
[SPEAKER_01]: But the houses on either side of me are much larger size.

764
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:16,462
[SPEAKER_01]: One guy just sort of moved out of his house because he couldn't take it.

765
01:16:16,502 --> 01:16:24,026
[SPEAKER_01]: They had broken a window in his son porch and he just, I haven't seen him around since then.

766
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:25,907
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on, um,

767
01:16:27,425 --> 01:16:42,517
[SPEAKER_01]: people on the other side of me, some of these people started out because this one guy's son, who was in college still, he knew some of these people and invited them to come in to their backyard.

768
01:16:42,557 --> 01:16:44,879
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're there back and forth and back and forth.

769
01:16:44,939 --> 01:16:51,725
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, as I started to say, yesterday, and then again this evening, I looked out

770
01:16:52,282 --> 01:16:54,385
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was before it started to get really dark.

771
01:16:55,326 --> 01:17:07,322
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a house on Jerome Street, and this was another person who looked like he was a part of this because they had him hanging up on the side of a wall of a house.

772
01:17:08,752 --> 01:17:10,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had people out there taking pictures of it.

773
01:17:10,754 --> 01:17:11,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Point of information, Mr. President?

774
01:17:11,715 --> 01:17:12,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

775
01:17:13,516 --> 01:17:16,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this matter would probably be appropriate for the police department.

776
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:17,359
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm thinking as well.

777
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,021
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to be police in nature.

778
01:17:19,541 --> 01:17:27,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the correct avenue is that we could also notify through our channels the police department.

779
01:17:27,848 --> 01:17:30,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they could do some mediation or see what's going on.

780
01:17:31,211 --> 01:17:32,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it would be helpful.

781
01:17:32,733 --> 01:17:35,355
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have talked to the police department.

782
01:17:36,373 --> 01:17:36,913
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a bit.

783
01:17:37,394 --> 01:17:38,294
[SPEAKER_01]: So they know.

784
01:17:38,494 --> 01:17:46,660
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I call the police department, they'll, they'll say, they know who I am and they'll say, oh, well, we'll get somebody out there as soon as we can.

785
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:48,601
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll do it from the council too.

786
01:17:48,861 --> 01:17:51,303
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll add a little more force to it.

787
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:58,047
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know whether they're supposed, if they were given the opportunity to do this kind of really stupid stuff.

788
01:17:59,068 --> 01:18:01,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, do they have to have a license to do that?

789
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:05,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I never heard the police saying, well, you have,

790
01:18:05,863 --> 01:18:09,147
[SPEAKER_01]: a license to do this, and therefore you can or not.

791
01:18:09,568 --> 01:18:10,950
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have the police look into it.

792
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:11,751
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the best.

793
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:12,592
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the best bet.

794
01:18:12,652 --> 01:18:16,076
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll contact the police, have the police look into it, and we'll go from there.

795
01:18:16,417 --> 01:18:16,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

796
01:18:16,917 --> 01:18:17,718
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.

797
01:18:17,758 --> 01:18:17,959
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

798
01:18:17,979 --> 01:18:21,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming up.

799
01:18:30,012 --> 01:18:37,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the motion, reports of committees, 2-0-0-6-3, February 18th, 2020 committee, the whole report to follow.

800
01:18:38,722 --> 01:18:40,263
[SPEAKER_07]: That report has not been completed yet.

801
01:18:40,343 --> 01:18:45,890
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to table the committee report, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

802
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:47,191
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

803
01:18:47,692 --> 01:18:48,372
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

804
01:18:48,412 --> 01:18:49,514
[SPEAKER_07]: That report has been tabled.

805
01:18:56,721 --> 01:19:01,204
[SPEAKER_07]: Records, the records of the meeting of February 18th, 2020 were passed to Councilor Knight.

806
