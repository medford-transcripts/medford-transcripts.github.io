1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:01,412
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:02,233 --> 00:00:02,493
Welcome.

3
00:00:02,513 --> 00:00:10,398
We're starting the April 30th Medford Zoning Appeals meeting with regards to 280 Mystic Now.

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:20,005
Dennis, could you read the notice?

5
00:00:20,025 --> 00:00:26,890
On March 29th, 2023, Governor Haley signed into law a Supplemental Budget Bill, which, among other things, extends to temporary provisions pertaining to the open meeting on March 31st, 2025.

6
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:37,244
Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely without a quorum of the public body physically present at any location, and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

7
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:44,746
The language that may make substantive changes to the Open Meeting Law is in extending the expiration date of the temporary provisions regarding remote meetings from March 31st, 2023 to March 31st, 2025.

8
00:00:44,786 --> 00:00:45,666
280 Mystic Avenue, case number 40B-2024-01.

9
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:12,924
The resumption of consideration of the petition of Combined Properties Incorporated for a comprehensive permit pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 40B for a multi-family, eight-story apartment development located in approximately 3.2 acres of land at 278-282 Mystic Avenue, property IDs 5018, 5019, 50110, 50110A, and 50110B.

10
00:01:17,584 --> 00:01:28,267
This proposal will be developed in approximately 378 units to a mix of one, two, and three bedroom apartments with 96, 25% of the total units of them being designated as affordable housing to low and moderate income households.

11
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:34,649
Thank you, Dennis.

12
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:36,869
Do we have representatives for the applicant?

13
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,731
Chris Mann, I see you're raising your hand.

14
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:45,492
Can you hear me?

15
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:46,932
We can.

16
00:01:48,452 --> 00:01:48,772
Oh, good.

17
00:01:51,553 --> 00:01:54,635
Yes, I'm Chris Meggeta with Combined Properties.

18
00:01:55,195 --> 00:01:58,657
I'm Senior Vice President of Business Development.

19
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:06,460
And will anybody else be speaking tonight?

20
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,781
Sure.

21
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:15,024
So I will just introduce, we have our development team here this evening.

22
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,801
So along with me is Brian Cafferty with Combined Properties.

23
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:22,862
He is our vice president of legal affairs.

24
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:26,184
We have Sean Burns from Combined Properties.

25
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:29,445
He is our vice president of design services.

26
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:35,627
John Carey from Combined Properties is our architectural project manager.

27
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:39,048
And then we have two consultants with us this evening.

28
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:44,890
Paul Avery of Oak Consulting Group is our site civil engineering consultant.

29
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:51,052
And Scott Thornton with Vanessa and Associates is our transportation consultant.

30
00:02:51,092 --> 00:02:57,693
Thank you.

31
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:06,796
Who wants to start?

32
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:08,316
Oh.

33
00:03:10,257 --> 00:03:12,618
So I can if you like, Mr. Chairman.

34
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:14,018
Please go ahead.

35
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:23,033
Sure, so is it possible that I can share screen and show you some slides?

36
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:25,814
Yes, you're all set.

37
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,118
And let's see, when I do that, will I lose my video?

38
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,820
Dennis, should I go full screen?

39
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,222
Yeah, I think if you do that, if you just do the share screen, it should.

40
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:49,880
Like, it'll basically move everything over to one, but what you want to show will pop up for everybody to see.

41
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,083
Sorry, Jamie, do we need to do a roll call just to open the meeting?

42
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:56,243
Thank you.

43
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:57,044
I apologize.

44
00:03:57,864 --> 00:03:59,565
You're correct.

45
00:04:00,065 --> 00:04:02,466
So attendance for the board.

46
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:06,548
Andrew in the room?

47
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:07,889
Present.

48
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,230
Mike Caldera?

49
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:11,331
Present.

50
00:04:13,012 --> 00:04:13,532
Jim Tirani?

51
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:14,518
Present.

52
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:16,359
Mary Lee.

53
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,520
Present.

54
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:20,841
Yvette Velez.

55
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:25,443
And Kristi Evano.

56
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:26,983
Present.

57
00:04:28,424 --> 00:04:28,804
Thank you.

58
00:04:28,824 --> 00:04:29,765
Appreciate that, Andre.

59
00:04:36,888 --> 00:04:37,128
Thank you.

60
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:45,996
So is there anything I need to do to share a screen?

61
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:52,141
On the bottom, you should have a button that says share screen.

62
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:53,902
Green share.

63
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:56,244
Let's see.

64
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:01,648
Let me go.

65
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,831
I see it, yes, share screen.

66
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:10,895
OK, and then I guess I would click on this.

67
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:16,988
So are you seeing a slide?

68
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:18,730
Yes.

69
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:21,653
I'm just curious.

70
00:05:21,673 --> 00:05:23,735
Does this slide fill up your whole screen?

71
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:25,957
Yes.

72
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:27,718
It does.

73
00:05:27,798 --> 00:05:28,419
OK.

74
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,161
All right.

75
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:34,845
So thank you, everybody, everyone, for your time this evening.

76
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:45,496
And we would like to share with you a background about this project, which we're calling 280 Mystic Avenue under the comprehensive permit application.

77
00:05:47,177 --> 00:05:53,800
I did introduce our project team who is here this evening and enthusiastic about the project.

78
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:59,843
And what we're hoping to do with a very brief agenda is tell you a bit about Combined Properties.

79
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:04,165
For those of you who might not be familiar, we'd like to say we're the local company that you never heard of.

80
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:34,034
give you some background about the project, the site itself, talk about the design and architecture and civil engineering, site civil engineering, address transportation planning, and then I think ideally turn it back over to you folks on the board and perhaps the public as well for any questions and comments that you might have, and then perhaps have a discussion with you folks on the board about next steps that you would see that would make sense in the process.

81
00:06:35,212 --> 00:06:36,933
So I'll go right ahead.

82
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:39,175
Feel free to ask any questions as I go along.

83
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:43,838
To tell you a little bit about Combined Properties, we're based in Malden.

84
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:48,621
We are a full-service real estate investment and development firm.

85
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:53,164
And let's see.

86
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:58,288
So interestingly enough, this slide has just changed.

87
00:06:58,388 --> 00:06:58,888
Oh, there it is.

88
00:06:58,928 --> 00:06:59,148
Look.

89
00:06:59,869 --> 00:07:00,269
Okay.

90
00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:01,089
So...

91
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:07,179
So our credo is creating better places to live, work, and play.

92
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:08,279
That's what we believe in.

93
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,040
We've actually been in Medford for 40 years.

94
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:19,364
We own five properties in Medford, all on Mystic Avenue, two of which are the subject of this project, 280 Mystic Avenue.

95
00:07:20,464 --> 00:07:27,707
The company dates from 1935, and we have acquired and developed over 3 million square feet of properties.

96
00:07:28,722 --> 00:07:33,806
One thing that's a little bit different about us is we are long-term owners and managers.

97
00:07:33,926 --> 00:07:42,031
So unlike some developers who develop and perhaps do it for a fee and then sell the property, we keep everything.

98
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:54,960
And so that informs the way that we form our relationships with communities and customers and residents, how we think about the care and development of our properties.

99
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:58,082
So I'll flip ahead here.

100
00:07:59,452 --> 00:08:01,234
And just give you a quick overview.

101
00:08:01,254 --> 00:08:14,783
I also want to mention that, and I think Dennis has shared with you, all of the project application materials are in a Dropbox folder that you can access.

102
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:22,789
If you have any difficulty accessing the folder, you should be able to view the documents as well as download them and print them.

103
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,952
If you have any difficulties, let Dennis know or let me know.

104
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,992
Dennis has asked me to share these slides with him after the presentation, and I will.

105
00:08:36,473 --> 00:08:40,014
And the first one here, you'll have my contact information.

106
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,195
Let me just move back ahead here.

107
00:08:43,215 --> 00:08:50,997
I also mentioned the project has not changed.

108
00:08:51,037 --> 00:08:58,640
We were first before the board in June of 2020 with this project, went into a period of hiatus,

109
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:02,546
Uh, we entered into a tolling agreement with the board.

110
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:16,974
Uh, there was a disagreement at the time about whether, um, the city would, uh, would, uh, uh, take advantage of safe harbor status under the 1.5% general land area minimum calculation.

111
00:09:18,135 --> 00:09:21,879
And there was a legal process going on before the Housing Appeals Committee.

112
00:09:21,939 --> 00:09:27,705
While that process was going along, we agreed with the board to enter into a tolling arrangement.

113
00:09:28,366 --> 00:09:32,450
And during that time, really, there was no activity.

114
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:34,753
So we're back before you again.

115
00:09:35,654 --> 00:09:39,477
The Housing Appeals Committee did issue a decision in that matter.

116
00:09:42,012 --> 00:09:46,675
recently, but we have made no changes to the project since then.

117
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:52,419
I will mention one change, which is a result of a zoning change.

118
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:59,843
The city put in place a modified way of calculating the amount of parking that would be required for a project.

119
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:10,070
If a project is within half a mile of a high-frequency transit resource and the project can have a somewhat reduced amount of parking on site,

120
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:28,602
And because this site, which is the subject of the project, is right across the street from the MBTA 95 bus line, which does meet the standards for high-frequency transit, the project can, by zoning, have a somewhat reduced number of parking spaces.

121
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:39,646
And looking at that, the new zoning, the amount of parking that we provide, which has not changed, actually falls within that, this new category.

122
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:47,282
And so in looking at the list of waivers that we would be requiring or requesting, one of them was going to be for parking spaces.

123
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:51,544
That waiver is no longer required because of the new zoning provision.

124
00:10:51,624 --> 00:10:56,546
So we did update the table of zoning waivers.

125
00:10:57,546 --> 00:11:08,290
And I did send that over to Dennis and chat with Dennis earlier this afternoon and also updated, I sent an updated version of the zoning table or I uploaded it to the Dropbox folder.

126
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:13,174
That's one modification, but everything else about the project is the same.

127
00:11:14,615 --> 00:11:20,239
So again, just a quick recap, a little bit about combined properties to show you some projects that we have completed.

128
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,182
This is Riverview Business Park on Commercial Street in Malden.

129
00:11:25,743 --> 00:11:27,124
We're showing you before and after.

130
00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:32,667
It's on the Malden River, which was historically a heavily industrialized river.

131
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:34,008
There was a U.S.

132
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,150
Navy Niter chemical depot there.

133
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:37,951
The Navy left.

134
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:43,766
It actually became Brother Gilbert Field, which was used by Malden Catholic High School.

135
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:45,687
They surplused it.

136
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:56,937
We acquired the property and redeveloped it into what we call Riverview Business Park, which is a pretty nice 100 or 95,000 square foot office and R&D building as you see it today.

137
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:01,237
This is a site in Peabody today called Centennial Park.

138
00:12:01,297 --> 00:12:16,685
It was really a dump site, and we were selected by the city of Peabody as the designated developer to kick off this project, and we have converted it into some first-class office and R&D facilities today.

139
00:12:18,426 --> 00:12:21,748
This is on the Malden River, 195 Canal Street.

140
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,830
It was a former chemical plant owned by a German company called Romtec.

141
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:34,825
They did some pretty heavy duty industrial chemical work there and surplus the property.

142
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:39,668
We bought it from them with some very serious geoenvironmental challenges.

143
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:48,013
We work with them to coordinate cleaning up the site and at the same time converting it into a medical office building.

144
00:12:48,673 --> 00:12:52,735
So today it's occupied by Cambridge Health Alliance as a clinic.

145
00:12:53,075 --> 00:12:55,937
So again, before and after pictures there on the Malden River.

146
00:12:58,155 --> 00:13:06,197
On the upper left, this is a site on Pleasant Street in Malden, a transit-oriented site, a block from the MBTA Orange Line.

147
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:13,759
Malden Center Station was some obsolescing, a very low-rise, rundown office and retail buildings.

148
00:13:14,499 --> 00:13:18,860
We redeveloped the site into 204 modern apartment buildings.

149
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,482
Today, 206, we've managed to add two more apartments there, so I think a pretty significant addition to the neighborhood.

150
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:28,716
to the downtown streetscape.

151
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:33,077
This is also in downtown Malden, also a block from the T Station.

152
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:35,358
We call it Exchange Street Apartments.

153
00:13:35,638 --> 00:13:40,220
It was a former grocery store and then became a fitness facility.

154
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,440
The fitness company left.

155
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,162
We acquired the site and converted it into 210 apartments.

156
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,263
So you can see the before and after pictures here.

157
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:52,787
This is the building that I'm in right now.

158
00:13:52,807 --> 00:13:55,028
I'm on the top floor of this building in the lower right.

159
00:13:55,088 --> 00:13:57,929
This is 295 Canal Street, also on the Malden River.

160
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:03,550
It was a single-story industrial building that was used for manufacturing of canvas products.

161
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,630
That company left.

162
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:16,593
The building was vacant for 20 years, and we converted it into a first-class office building and also managed to, I think, upgrade the Malden Riverfront in the process.

163
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:22,295
This is a pro bono project that we did for the Malden YMCA.

164
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:34,643
We were heavily involved in the capital campaign for their, really, it's not a redevelopment, it's a new Y. On the left in the before picture shows us what the Y used to look like.

165
00:14:34,683 --> 00:14:41,687
It was one of the oldest and original YMCA facilities in the US, very run down, serious structural problems.

166
00:14:42,647 --> 00:14:46,730
They were losing membership, so we got involved in a capital campaign also

167
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:57,884
in working with them to oversee the design and construction of a new Y. The site of the Y is a former National Guard armory in Malden.

168
00:14:57,984 --> 00:15:02,648
We managed to work with the city and the National Guard to have the Y surplused.

169
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:03,629
It was not being used.

170
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:15,079
And then ultimately transferred into the ownership of the YMCA and sort of redeveloped into a new state-of-the-art YMCA facility, and their membership has bounced right back.

171
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,694
Again, the pro bono project, not a profit-making project for us.

172
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:26,518
We do own five properties on the Malden River, totaling over half a mile of river frontage.

173
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:33,441
And we have been working step-by-step to bring public access back to the Malden River.

174
00:15:33,461 --> 00:15:38,063
Here are a couple pictures of a path that we have built along the Malden River.

175
00:15:39,804 --> 00:15:42,365
And then again, and lastly, on the subject of the river,

176
00:15:43,473 --> 00:15:51,795
We were, I think, in the vanguard of realizing that the Malden River has value as an environmental resource and a recreational resource.

177
00:15:52,895 --> 00:16:04,937
And about over 20 years ago, we worked with Tufts University for relocation of their rowing program from Harvard's Newell Boathouse on the Charles River over here to Malden, where they have taken root.

178
00:16:04,957 --> 00:16:08,178
They now, as you know, have a permanent boathouse in the River's Edge project.

179
00:16:09,247 --> 00:16:22,695
And the river is now being used by Tufts as well as by high school programs, including by Malden, I mean, sorry, Medford High School and Somerville High Schools, as well as Malden High School and Mystic Valley Regional Charter School.

180
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:31,540
So we have kind of adopted the river as a cause, again, to bring attention to its value for environmental purposes and recreation.

181
00:16:33,174 --> 00:16:46,460
So now finally coming to the site itself, the site of the project, the site we're calling 280 Mystic Avenue, and it's a combination of two existing properties, 278 Mystic Avenue and 282 Mystic Avenue.

182
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,761
I'm sure you're all very familiar with Mystic Avenue.

183
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:55,284
282 is the site of a former Staples store, a single-story building.

184
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:57,385
Staples was there for many years.

185
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:02,426
They relocated to assembly and vacated the site.

186
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:06,069
For a while, there was a Dunkin' Donuts and a Pizza Hut, and then they left.

187
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,652
Dunkin' Donuts actually moved across the street into their own building.

188
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,575
The building itself had some pretty severe structural issues.

189
00:17:13,795 --> 00:17:17,138
The soil there is very soft, built on wooden piles.

190
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:24,904
And ultimately, with the building being vacant and examining more closely the structural conditions, the building was not worth saving.

191
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:27,597
And we had to take it down a few years ago.

192
00:17:27,697 --> 00:17:31,040
So right now, the site is being used for parking by a car dealership.

193
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,542
Not exactly a high use, but some use.

194
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:38,006
And then 278 Mystic Avenue is a two-story office building.

195
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:42,950
If you're familiar with the area, you'll recognize Bank of America on the first floor.

196
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,354
They have a pretty good size banking office there, as well as a drive-through.

197
00:17:47,374 --> 00:17:49,957
There's a little bit of office space upstairs.

198
00:17:52,238 --> 00:18:08,025
And so the genesis of this project, the project that we're before you to talk about this evening, is a combination of those two sites that are really underutilized to create some much-needed housing.

199
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:11,646
I'm going to show you a view of this looking south.

200
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:15,028
So this is the same site looking south, thanks to Google Earth.

201
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:21,925
We can see the city of Boston on the horizon, giving you a sense of the proximity to the city of Boston.

202
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:24,687
The site itself is a little bit of an island.

203
00:18:25,547 --> 00:18:28,670
On the south end is what was Century Bank.

204
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,474
It's now Herb Chambers, the five-story office building down there in green with the ribbon windows.

205
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:37,797
And on the north end is the new bank branch.

206
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:50,875
So you can get a sense of the proximity of the site, certainly to Route 93, very handy for on and off 93, as well as Route 16 and Mystic Avenue and Route 38.

207
00:18:52,015 --> 00:18:59,378
And then lastly, looking at some of the transit connections, transportation connections, and it's a little bit difficult to see.

208
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:01,599
I don't know if my mouse works in sharing mode.

209
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:07,782
I'm going to kind of circle my mouse around this blue spot in the lower center that says 280.

210
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,452
And that is the project site.

211
00:19:12,692 --> 00:19:20,778
We have stepped back, so we're in our helicopter flying back a little bit, looking southward again with the City of Boston over here.

212
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:33,307
And so we can see the proximity of the site to the City of Boston, very good access to Route 93, certainly routes to Route 16, Mystic Valley Parkway, and Mystic Avenue, Route 38.

213
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,702
Right at the doorstep of the site are two bus stops for the MBTA Route 95 bus.

214
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,382
There's one on each side of Mystic Avenue, so very handy.

215
00:19:45,222 --> 00:19:46,383
Transit access there.

216
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:53,344
The new Green Line extension comes up this way, and there's a Ball Square station where I'm circling here.

217
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:57,625
It's not right on the doorstep, but there's some proximity there to the Green Line.

218
00:19:58,995 --> 00:20:08,022
In the lower right, we can see Tufts has some proximity to the site, and then going south and west, obviously Cambridge and Somerville.

219
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:19,312
And then further as we go south, we see the Orange Line coming out from Boston, there's the Sullivan Square Station, the Assembly Station, and the Wellington Station.

220
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:25,657
Maldon to the, obviously Medford continues to the east, and then if you keep going, we come into Maldon,

221
00:20:26,465 --> 00:20:31,309
And then we can see Everett, Chelsea, East Boston, and Logan Airport, along with Charlestown.

222
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,793
There, as you know, probably no numerous bike paths and walking paths here.

223
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:38,215
The river is a nice amenity.

224
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:41,337
And so just a little bit of an orientation.

225
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,481
So that's a bit of background that I wanted to share with you folks.

226
00:20:48,062 --> 00:20:52,006
I will turn it over to Sean Burns, who is our chief architect in the office.

227
00:20:52,902 --> 00:20:58,087
And he can talk about the design and planning of the project itself.

228
00:20:58,288 --> 00:21:07,256
So, Dennis, do you need me to do anything as far as the screen or Chairman Thompson?

229
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:10,359
I don't think so.

230
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:13,322
I'm going to just stop your sharing and then we can go on to the next one.

231
00:21:13,362 --> 00:21:15,264
I think that's what you seem to do.

232
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:15,504
Great.

233
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:15,845
Thank you.

234
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:24,105
Okay, thank you, Chris.

235
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:29,207
Thank you, board members for taking time out of your busy lives to come here today.

236
00:21:29,227 --> 00:21:33,968
I also, I'm going to share my screen.

237
00:21:38,389 --> 00:21:46,251
And I will start here with the overall description of our proposed project at 280 Mystic Avenue.

238
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:48,351
We're proposing 378 units.

239
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,529
25 percent of those units will be affordable.

240
00:21:56,171 --> 00:22:03,097
We have a mix of 50 studios, 167 one bedrooms, 122 bedrooms, and 41 three bedrooms.

241
00:22:03,117 --> 00:22:07,140
Each one of those bedroom types has a 25 percent affordable category.

242
00:22:19,702 --> 00:22:26,788
The building itself is eight stories, 85 feet high.

243
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:36,315
It is approximately 600,000 gross square feet over those eight floors onto the site.

244
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:47,364
We have a list of zoning relief required over here on the left, which you will fall, I'm sure, seen.

245
00:22:50,864 --> 00:23:08,651
We've eliminated the need for zoning relief for the parking with the advent of the lower parking ratio for transit-oriented or rapid transit-oriented businesses.

246
00:23:09,812 --> 00:23:13,113
And we have

247
00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:32,204
I'll move us to the next sheet, which is our landscape and planting plan.

248
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:37,569
As you can see, the building takes up the majority of the site.

249
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:44,955
The site is ordered here by the Mystic Valley Parkway.

250
00:23:45,984 --> 00:23:59,027
Mystic Ave, Route 38, and Winterbrook to our south, 93 directly east, and to the north is that bank lot.

251
00:24:03,448 --> 00:24:09,290
We are proposing that this eight-story building sits here.

252
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,450
The first two floors are parking.

253
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,951
Parking is all accessed from the

254
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:25,349
northernmost, or excuse me, southernmost entry here, farthest away from the Harvard Street intersection.

255
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,172
The garage is entered on this side.

256
00:24:30,693 --> 00:24:34,696
The main entry to the building is here, facing Mystic Avenue.

257
00:24:35,536 --> 00:24:45,103
There's a small landscaping area here and some visitor parkings in front of the building.

258
00:24:46,171 --> 00:24:59,801
We've suggested a multi-use path that circles the south and east and allows you to cut out this busy intersection to our north.

259
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:11,350
We've created a double O type of arrangement to give courtyards, and these would be on the third floor of the building,

260
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,964
These courtyards are 85 feet in this direction, and 135 in this direction.

261
00:25:16,984 --> 00:25:18,265
At its longest, it's 125 here, and basically 85 by 85.

262
00:25:18,305 --> 00:25:18,906
I think... continue?

263
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:36,324
This is our 1st floor plan.

264
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:43,027
It's typical parking deck for both the 1st and 2nd floors.

265
00:25:45,448 --> 00:25:48,709
Organized parking and a speed ramp up the back here.

266
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:58,353
Again, we have entries here, trash on both sides of the building, and our stairway systems.

267
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,714
We have a main lobby here.

268
00:26:03,124 --> 00:26:05,406
double height space.

269
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:07,828
We go back.

270
00:26:11,952 --> 00:26:19,839
As far as handling loading and trash, we've suggested a one-way access and this is a limited access drive.

271
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:29,327
It goes around the building in this direction for both emergency and non-emergency access to the building.

272
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:41,317
Typical, well, this is a third floor, so it's not quite typical because it's the floor that has the courtyards.

273
00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:59,393
So we have a number of units on the inside here that have access to the courtyards, and the units above them, of course, will have access to the light from the courtyards, and then the second double-loaded ring units on the outside of the building.

274
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:15,261
We have, this is the elevation from Mystic Ave and the elevation looking from 93.

275
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:31,748
We have a mix of materials, but we have primarily, we have a two-story visual podium that's made out of possibly architectural masonry block.

276
00:27:32,946 --> 00:27:41,693
We have some areas here on the facade in a red brick color in an attempt to break up some of the massing.

277
00:27:43,154 --> 00:28:01,327
And we have these bump-outs that occur pretty much at every unit and gives the opportunity to create some nice living space and also gives you some variety on that facade.

278
00:28:02,455 --> 00:28:07,099
And then we have capped off the building with lighter material.

279
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:16,646
And again, you'll see that we're at 85 feet to the roof level.

280
00:28:24,532 --> 00:28:31,057
And again, to the shorter, if you will, elevations.

281
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:35,267
of the building with the same mix of materials.

282
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:40,771
We've placed trees in the landscaping plan where we could fit them.

283
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:52,920
This is a section of the building showing that indeed the courtyard of the building is substantial.

284
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:56,882
The shortest dimension in the courtyard is 85 feet.

285
00:28:58,811 --> 00:29:08,819
and then the longest dimension in that south is 185 feet and close to 135 in the north most courtyard.

286
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:18,307
That's a brief overview of how we got to this place, the architecture.

287
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:25,574
I know that we'll be having lots of discussions about the architecture and that's

288
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,798
massing and the site plan in the future.

289
00:29:29,578 --> 00:29:53,605
But given that this is an introductory presentation, I think I'd like to stop there and turn the microphone over to Mr. Paul Avery, who is our site civil, to give us a brief description of the site and how the civil is going to work.

290
00:29:53,965 --> 00:29:54,425
Thank you, Paul.

291
00:29:56,513 --> 00:29:57,274
Thank you, Sean.

292
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:59,455
Can everyone see my screen?

293
00:29:59,475 --> 00:30:11,161
I will do a quick overview of the site grading drainage and site utilities.

294
00:30:12,562 --> 00:30:16,825
This plan on the screen now is just an existing conditions plan.

295
00:30:17,145 --> 00:30:18,906
There's a lot of detail here.

296
00:30:18,926 --> 00:30:20,707
I don't want to

297
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:28,474
get into too much detail here on this at all, but basically there are a number of drainage systems that are shown on this and

298
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:32,430
The systems do one of three things.

299
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:42,252
They either run off onto Mystic Avenue, they go into Winter Brook to the south, or they go onto Mystic Valley Parkway to the northwest.

300
00:30:42,932 --> 00:30:52,575
There are no stormwater management provisions on site, no detention features, no water quality features, and all of this is in disrepair.

301
00:30:54,163 --> 00:31:02,762
What we're proposing to do shown here in green is the two prominent features you see here, these green rectangles.

302
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:13,593
is we plan to take the rooftop runoff and infiltrate it into the subsurface below the parking, which occupies the first two levels of the building.

303
00:31:14,534 --> 00:31:19,817
That, as you can see, will accommodate the majority of the site area.

304
00:31:21,118 --> 00:31:29,343
The remainder of the site is the parking, not the parking, but the driveways which go around it, and we're proposing new systems to collect all of that.

305
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:34,866
We will eliminate surface runoff onto Mystic Avenue.

306
00:31:35,546 --> 00:31:41,129
We will, well, almost eliminate, just a little bit off the curb line, but effectively eliminate it.

307
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:54,676
We will eliminate entirely runoff onto Mystic Valley Parkway and the new systems will discharge into Winterbrook or the conduit that continues under Route 93.

308
00:31:56,614 --> 00:32:07,965
All of this will be treated for water quality in accordance with the applicable state and local stormwater management rules and regulations.

309
00:32:08,586 --> 00:32:19,577
But basically, through all the infiltration we're providing, and then the treatment of the remaining surface runoff, expect to significantly improve the existing conditions and be in compliance with current rules.

310
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:24,813
Utilities have color coded this out.

311
00:32:25,513 --> 00:32:31,556
Our utilities will come from existing systems on Mystic Avenue.

312
00:32:32,456 --> 00:32:34,717
In blue we have water systems.

313
00:32:34,777 --> 00:32:41,721
We're showing separate fire and water supply services coming off of Mystic Avenue.

314
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:46,843
The sewer we've shown coming out here just as a general location.

315
00:32:46,903 --> 00:32:50,065
We could possibly have multiple connections depending upon how

316
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:56,349
the building lays out, but the intent is to connect into the sewer system along Mystic Avenue.

317
00:32:57,069 --> 00:33:01,292
Again, with the gas and electric, connect off of those services too.

318
00:33:01,332 --> 00:33:09,037
There's a lot going on with some existing utilities on the site, some of which may need to be relocated to accommodate the project.

319
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:18,663
We anticipate doing full capacity analyses and confirming that the systems in Mystic Avenue have the capacities for the project.

320
00:33:19,323 --> 00:33:28,649
And earlier discussions, we talked about improvements to the water line, which I understand has some leaks along the property frontage.

321
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:34,953
And that is pretty much it from the snapshot on site utilities.

322
00:33:41,697 --> 00:33:45,139
Scott, do you want to talk about transportation?

323
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:47,614
Sure.

324
00:33:49,375 --> 00:33:49,915
Thanks, Chris.

325
00:33:50,935 --> 00:33:54,196
Mr. Chairman, members of the board, Scott Thornton with Van Ness & Associates.

326
00:33:55,296 --> 00:33:59,477
Excited to be working with Combined Properties on this residential project on Mystic Avenue.

327
00:34:00,797 --> 00:34:12,440
We prepared the original traffic study for this development in 2020 and the scope of that study was confirmed with the Medford Director of Traffic and Parking and included

328
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:20,324
11 intersections in proximity to the site along Mystic Ave, Harvard Street and Main Street.

329
00:34:20,944 --> 00:34:30,829
We expect to update that study and provide the same coverage to provide an assessment of the project's impacts.

330
00:34:32,202 --> 00:34:39,206
We'll conduct an assessment of the transit facilities and look at the MBTA schedule and ridership details.

331
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:44,149
As Chris indicated, the 95 bus runs along Mystic Ave.

332
00:34:44,189 --> 00:34:47,771
The 101 bus runs along Main and Medford streets.

333
00:34:48,512 --> 00:34:52,394
The 101 bus is a little further away.

334
00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:58,478
The Green Line is at Ball Square, which is about a mile away from the site or a 20-minute walk.

335
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:09,585
I'm not sure that that ridership data exists for the Green Line yet since the extension project is so new, but we will look into that as part of the analysis.

336
00:35:10,946 --> 00:35:16,410
We expect to include a number of background projects for future conditions.

337
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,690
We are aware of

338
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:30,514
plus or minus 11 in the area, including the Beer Hall up the road at 142 Mystic Ave and the Assembly Row full build out, as well as a number of others.

339
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:43,758
In terms of project generation or trip generation, we think the site should generate somewhere between 130 and 170 peak hour trips during the morning and the evening time periods.

340
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:46,239
That's a total of entering and exiting.

341
00:35:48,219 --> 00:36:07,045
and we'll look at census data for that tract to get an idea how many residents in the area currently use alternative transportation and factor this into our analysis and we expect to include in our future conditions a review of the

342
00:36:07,826 --> 00:36:21,065
of the intersection operations, capacity analysis of the study area locations to get an idea of the operating conditions, both pre and post development.

343
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:35,614
And we expect to work with the city staff and eventually with a peer review consultant to address any concerns that are raised during that process.

344
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:51,322
But we started the process, we're planning on conducting some traffic counts in the next couple of weeks to get an idea of existing conditions, and then we'll just roll into the traffic study.

345
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:58,953
Chris, I think that's it for a snapshot of the traffic analysis.

346
00:36:59,013 --> 00:36:59,853
I'll turn it back over to you.

347
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:00,393
Thank you.

348
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:05,334
Scott, thanks, and thanks, Paul, and thanks, Sean.

349
00:37:06,514 --> 00:37:21,937
And I guess, you know, Mr. Chairman, I think back over to you for whatever next steps you think, any comments or questions, whatever you think is productive.

350
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:23,812
Thank you, everyone.

351
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,413
I will open it to the board to any questions for the applicant.

352
00:37:30,294 --> 00:37:30,814
Mike Caldera.

353
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:33,535
Thanks, Jamie.

354
00:37:34,495 --> 00:37:44,338
So I understand the intention today is mostly to get the initial presentation and take some procedural steps, so I'll keep my comments brief.

355
00:37:47,077 --> 00:37:50,120
And also focused on just moving us in the right direction.

356
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:57,349
So I've had a chance to review the submitted application in full, and I have several concerns that I'd like to see addressed before our next meeting.

357
00:37:59,031 --> 00:38:04,258
One, the submitted materials are inadequate to understand the project in context.

358
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:13,469
The board relies on input from peer reviewers and city staff for its analysis, and currently there's insufficient details for those reviews to commence in earnest.

359
00:38:14,249 --> 00:38:27,096
I'm going to request that city staff ASAP compile and supply the proponent a list of information requests necessary to do this work, as well as requests from the peer review consultants once retained.

360
00:38:28,808 --> 00:38:36,654
The proponent should in turn supply these materials in a timely fashion to the city staff so that the board has this feedback in advance of our next meeting.

361
00:38:37,995 --> 00:38:42,558
Second, I think the unchanged plans here are a missed opportunity.

362
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:52,986
Back in 2020, some current and former city staff wrote letters to the board expressing multiple concerns with the project that have yet to be reflected in the plans.

363
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:58,130
The project is proposed in a focal location in a manner that's incongruous

364
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:00,619
with Medford's comprehensive plan.

365
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:14,383
I would like the proponent to take an opportunity to discuss with city staff and identify paths to modify the proposal in consideration of this plan and the likely uses that will pop up in proximity to the parcel.

366
00:39:15,223 --> 00:39:25,046
Additionally, the updated zoning evaluation stopped short of an updated waiver list, which should also include the non-dimensional requirements from which the project requires zoning relief.

367
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:26,807
And lastly,

368
00:39:27,828 --> 00:39:32,531
The project also misses an opportunity to remove pavement from the buffer zone around Winterbrook.

369
00:39:33,552 --> 00:39:42,678
I'd ask that they please work with the city to identify a path to increase the impervious surfaces in this portion of the property to improve the environment and reduce the risk of flooding.

370
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:50,863
The project would also benefit from publicly usable open space exterior to the structure for the benefit of its own residents and area residents.

371
00:39:57,398 --> 00:40:01,561
Thank you, Mike.

372
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:06,185
Mr. Maeda, do you want to respond to that?

373
00:40:06,245 --> 00:40:11,048
I appreciate the analysis, and I'm taking copious notes.

374
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:14,671
So we welcome your input.

375
00:40:17,473 --> 00:40:19,014
Thank you.

376
00:40:19,034 --> 00:40:19,915
Yeah, through the chair, thank you.

377
00:40:19,935 --> 00:40:24,959
Yeah, and my input is just we really need more details to fully review the project.

378
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:34,740
For the rest of the board, any other perspectives, questions for the applicant?

379
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:36,841
Andre?

380
00:40:38,422 --> 00:40:39,042
Yeah, thank you.

381
00:40:39,902 --> 00:40:42,343
Just a couple of some basic questions.

382
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:51,426
One is, so this is a wood frame over platform, is that correct?

383
00:40:51,586 --> 00:40:56,688
Is that six, look like six stories of wood frame?

384
00:41:01,012 --> 00:41:03,753
At this point, it would have done likely to be wood frame.

385
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:05,993
It would probably be metal frame.

386
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:07,714
Okay, great.

387
00:41:09,674 --> 00:41:20,737
And I remember one point, this may have been a long time ago, but way before my time on the board, but was there also a

388
00:41:22,777 --> 00:41:35,829
a time when there was consideration of a three-building redevelopment that extended to the other side of the drainage area on Mystic Ave?

389
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,740
Sean, do you want to comment?

390
00:41:49,537 --> 00:41:51,999
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry, Chris, I was waiting for you, too.

391
00:41:52,539 --> 00:42:03,627
In the past, we've done a few presentations to the city departments.

392
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:14,434
One of those did include residential buildings south of Winterbrook, and we also, over the past

393
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:24,798
I would say 18 months ago, we're looking at doing three life science buildings on the entirety of the site.

394
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:33,426
I think at this point, the life science sector of our economy is taking a pause.

395
00:42:34,647 --> 00:42:39,692
So any kind of development along those lines is also taking a pause.

396
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:59,893
Likewise, I think concentrating on this site is what the north of the Winterbrook site is the intention of the ownership at this point.

397
00:43:01,553 --> 00:43:08,016
It's a big site, likely it would have to be phased, a north phase and a south phase anyway.

398
00:43:09,197 --> 00:43:18,781
So we did want to get something going on the books for that north side as we develop plans for the south side.

399
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:19,822
Yeah.

400
00:43:20,282 --> 00:43:26,405
And has there been any discussion with the owner of the two-story bank building on the corner?

401
00:43:28,624 --> 00:43:29,785
of Route 16?

402
00:43:30,485 --> 00:43:40,553
Historically, they have been in touch with us, even predating the recent, let's say, reimagining of that building.

403
00:43:42,034 --> 00:43:52,942
And going back to when it was really used by their auto service business, they

404
00:43:54,585 --> 00:43:59,786
Really, I think they came down to, I guess, a difference of opinion as to what the value of that site is.

405
00:43:59,966 --> 00:44:10,528
As you know, it's a pretty small site and not, I have to say, not really necessary for redeveloping the site that we're talking about today.

406
00:44:10,868 --> 00:44:20,290
It just was apparent that they didn't want to sell it and there wasn't really an agreement on the value of it.

407
00:44:21,678 --> 00:44:24,379
Um, you know, they went their way, and I guess we're going our way.

408
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:46,425
Okay, and obviously these questions are just along the lines of, um, the whole Mystic Valley, you know, corridor, or Mystic Ave corridor is really a, uh, you know, in transformation right now, and so the opportunity to

409
00:44:47,607 --> 00:45:01,104
Be a little bit more comprehensive with the properties on either side could give a little bit more flexibility in terms of the design and setting kind of the stage for that kind of next.

410
00:45:02,558 --> 00:45:04,920
next era of Mystic Ave.

411
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:18,311
So I'm hearing that that's not possible right now, but certainly something that we, at least I would have welcomed quite a bit.

412
00:45:18,751 --> 00:45:20,633
And I think part of that is

413
00:45:22,214 --> 00:45:42,869
You know, from what I'm from what I'm seeing, it's it's a very large building footprint on the site, and so not as much flexibility in terms of being able to provide kind of public facing amenities and would certainly like to be.

414
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:48,433
You know, thinking about that and to the extent that we can.

415
00:45:50,377 --> 00:46:08,865
Minimize that footprint and get some more public amenities out of the project would be great, particularly just in terms of turning Mystic Ave into more of a boulevard that is a good place to live, frankly, right?

416
00:46:08,965 --> 00:46:13,127
It's not been a place where there's been much residential use on it.

417
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:18,267
I think those are my comments for them.

418
00:46:18,428 --> 00:46:28,475
Oh, the other question that I had was just to confirm, the landscaping and the architecture, is that all done in-house, combined properties?

419
00:46:31,457 --> 00:46:34,980
At this stage in the development, that's true.

420
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,061
Okay.

421
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:36,581
Thank you.

422
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:44,547
Can I also just add one note on the subject of the life science concept?

423
00:46:46,612 --> 00:47:04,078
I think it was after we reached the tolling arrangement with the ZBA in 2020, the mayor actually suggested to us thinking about life science as a possible use for not only this site, but the two properties to the south of it.

424
00:47:05,326 --> 00:47:08,488
And we looked into it and actually thought it was a great idea.

425
00:47:09,148 --> 00:47:19,393
And we invested quite a bit of effort into design and engineering to create a life science project there, three building life science project.

426
00:47:20,774 --> 00:47:30,079
And as Sean mentioned, really the kind of the water drained out of the pool, terms of life science market, not anybody's fault.

427
00:47:31,159 --> 00:47:31,940
It was a good idea.

428
00:47:32,877 --> 00:47:42,060
But if we look at the real estate aspects of the life science business today, there's a lot of vacant life science office and laboratory space out there.

429
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:45,581
There are life science companies dumping space back on the market.

430
00:47:45,801 --> 00:47:51,482
There's even vacancy in Cambridge, which has been ground zero for life science in the US for quite some time.

431
00:47:52,863 --> 00:48:01,725
There are, as you're probably aware, there are two very large buildings coming online in assembly that together are almost a million square feet.

432
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:04,971
of space, which so far as I know is still available.

433
00:48:05,972 --> 00:48:15,157
And there's quite an overhang of vacant office space, just plain office space out there that some of which could be positioned or repositioned as life science space.

434
00:48:15,197 --> 00:48:25,623
So altogether, the condition in the life science market for real estate went from, you know, the sun is out to shelter in place.

435
00:48:26,752 --> 00:48:34,136
And, you know, I'm not sure that my crystal ball is better than anyone else's, but I don't have a feeling of this is going to bounce back.

436
00:48:34,396 --> 00:48:40,740
I think this is going to be a long term situation of trying to absorb the space that's out there.

437
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,921
So we never lost our interest in multifamily.

438
00:48:43,961 --> 00:48:46,102
We always feel as though there's a need for housing.

439
00:48:46,142 --> 00:48:47,163
People need a place to live.

440
00:48:48,753 --> 00:48:55,336
We kind of came back to this after trying to make the life science concept work again.

441
00:48:55,376 --> 00:48:56,017
Nobody's fault.

442
00:48:56,037 --> 00:48:57,698
It's just the market did what the market did.

443
00:48:58,778 --> 00:49:06,882
So I guess I'm trying to explain how it is that we've come full circle back to you folks with a housing concept.

444
00:49:07,894 --> 00:49:08,615
Yeah, thank you.

445
00:49:08,635 --> 00:49:12,198
I understand that about the life sciences and what's happened in the market.

446
00:49:12,258 --> 00:49:25,349
There was a lot of speculative life science projects being built, and that was my concern when we were considering seeing different possible developments in Medford.

447
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:35,397
But it does remind me of my last question, which I forgot to ask, which is, is there a retail or mixed-use component to this on the first floor at all, or is this 100% residential?

448
00:49:37,769 --> 00:49:39,552
Right now it's it's pure residential.

449
00:49:39,572 --> 00:49:43,799
Great, thank you.

450
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:48,566
Go ahead.

451
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:54,006
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

452
00:49:54,787 --> 00:50:00,428
I guess, piggybacking somewhat on that, my first question was, is it all residential?

453
00:50:01,608 --> 00:50:07,170
I wanted to know, too, about the mixed-use component or lack thereof.

454
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,891
I think that's a real lost opportunity here.

455
00:50:11,571 --> 00:50:16,632
I think if you're going to activate that side of the road, which is, you know, there's no...

456
00:50:18,813 --> 00:50:22,377
Walkable retail right now on that whole stretch.

457
00:50:23,538 --> 00:50:29,024
From the highway on ramp down to the bank, except perhaps for the bank.

458
00:50:29,885 --> 00:50:32,207
At the end, there's the car.

459
00:50:33,315 --> 00:50:45,838
dealer, but there's no reason to really go down to that side of the road very much, at least out of normal business hours.

460
00:50:46,379 --> 00:51:01,723
So I guess what I have is a comment more than a question, and I don't confess to know the commercial real estate market

461
00:51:02,633 --> 00:51:29,244
such as you folks do, but what would prevent you from perhaps a larger building or two larger buildings of a combined office residential component, much like we're seeing in Assembly Square or, you know, that area?

462
00:51:30,115 --> 00:51:36,457
How are you seeing that that market is not there anymore?

463
00:51:36,897 --> 00:51:38,697
And I'm not talking about the life sciences market.

464
00:51:38,717 --> 00:51:42,438
I'm talking about just the commercial office market.

465
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:47,200
Can I?

466
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,320
So, good question.

467
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,520
Thank you.

468
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:50,860
Thanks.

469
00:51:53,902 --> 00:52:01,789
You know, the office market, what's called the pure office market itself, is very challenging right now.

470
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:03,971
There's a lot of vacant space.

471
00:52:05,272 --> 00:52:07,154
The building that I'm in would be a good example.

472
00:52:07,934 --> 00:52:14,180
So this is a 55,000 square foot office building, and I'm sitting on the top floor.

473
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:19,865
We have 45,000 square feet on the floors below me that are vacant, and

474
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,682
very little leasing activity.

475
00:52:24,343 --> 00:52:31,810
If I could count on one hand, the number of inquiries we've had from prospective tenants since the building opened in the last five years.

476
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:37,515
I think part of this is a reflection of the general condition of the economy.

477
00:52:37,575 --> 00:52:39,036
Part of it is the trend.

478
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:41,718
We keep reading about work from home, remote working.

479
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:45,822
And that seems to have, for now, taken hold.

480
00:52:47,103 --> 00:52:51,365
seems like office users are reevaluating the way that organized work.

481
00:52:52,325 --> 00:53:07,251
And many of them are coming to the conclusion that the kind of conventional wisdom of having an office, maybe it's really not so necessary or maybe necessary only for a few people or some people some of the time.

482
00:53:08,532 --> 00:53:12,934
And all of that has resulted in quite a bit of office space that's available.

483
00:53:12,954 --> 00:53:15,815
Of course, I don't have a number off the top of my head

484
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:30,085
But the office market itself is very difficult, certainly for a developer to approach a lender today for a development loan, a construction loan.

485
00:53:30,105 --> 00:53:31,745
The banks are very much aware of this too.

486
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:38,708
Many of the banks are taking back properties on which they had loaned money, office properties.

487
00:53:39,808 --> 00:53:44,250
And if you look in the right places, there's a lot of publicity about this.

488
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,231
So it's a reasonable question, Chris.

489
00:53:47,165 --> 00:53:56,129
And I think if the market were different, there might be more seeming feasibility.

490
00:53:57,149 --> 00:53:58,630
Sometimes we say we know too much.

491
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,191
Maybe this is one of those examples.

492
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:05,333
But the office market is pretty challenging out there.

493
00:54:05,353 --> 00:54:13,516
The second question I had is somewhat related, but are there any

494
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:18,331
reasons or geotechnical reasons you're not going higher with this building.

495
00:54:19,952 --> 00:54:33,397
Along that stretch of Mystic Ave, it's actually, it's not that tall because of the scale of everything there, the wide road and the other one-story buildings that are in there.

496
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:41,000
It will appear somewhat tall because you're compared and contrasted against those.

497
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,961
But in reality, when you're

498
00:54:45,158 --> 00:54:59,368
when you're looking at what was the, I guess it's now the Herb Chambers-owned building, it's the tallest one there, even in your flyovers, it doesn't really look all that tall.

499
00:54:59,969 --> 00:55:08,595
Is there a reason why you're not trying to actually build a larger structure there?

500
00:55:08,615 --> 00:55:11,977
Go ahead, Chris.

501
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:19,572
There's no real geotechnical reason why we're not going higher.

502
00:55:21,272 --> 00:55:37,818
We're just trying to gauge what is possible with zoning and with the economy and with the politics of everything surrounding this building.

503
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,000
The Herb Chambers building is probably about

504
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,501
75 feet at its tallest.

505
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:46,102
Ours is slightly taller.

506
00:55:47,522 --> 00:55:51,224
But there's no practical reason why it couldn't go higher.

507
00:55:52,144 --> 00:55:57,167
There may be some, you know, resistance for other reasons.

508
00:56:01,189 --> 00:56:01,789
Thank you, Mr. Burns.

509
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:03,610
Mr. Mahan.

510
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:09,092
Sure, I just would add to what Sean said that

511
00:56:10,687 --> 00:56:13,189
You know, taller also meant more units.

512
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:18,334
You know, along with that, there's some parking that would need to be provided.

513
00:56:20,515 --> 00:56:26,521
And it seems like a two-story podium of parking is pretty practical, pretty constructible.

514
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:28,242
Physically, yes, we could go taller.

515
00:56:29,863 --> 00:56:34,527
But if it meant more units, we would obviously need to accommodate the parking for that somehow.

516
00:56:34,968 --> 00:56:38,591
We did a little bit of looking at going down on the site for parking.

517
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:45,031
And yes, as the old saying would indicate, anything is possible.

518
00:56:47,051 --> 00:56:49,832
But it would be relatively more expensive to go down.

519
00:56:49,992 --> 00:56:54,453
There's a pretty high water table there because of the proximity to the Mystic River.

520
00:56:55,733 --> 00:57:01,495
And so this seemed like, I guess, kind of a sweet spot, I guess.

521
00:57:02,479 --> 00:57:04,200
balancing a number of factors.

522
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:11,103
And Chris, I don't know if that's, you know, as sharp an answer as you might like, but that's maybe the best way we could describe it.

523
00:57:12,403 --> 00:57:13,284
Yeah, no, thank you.

524
00:57:13,484 --> 00:57:13,764
Thank you.

525
00:57:14,344 --> 00:57:21,447
I mean, if you look at old photographs of that area, it's all swamp, you know, going back to the 30s or 40s.

526
00:57:23,128 --> 00:57:23,428
It is.

527
00:57:28,270 --> 00:57:29,751
Thank you, gentlemen.

528
00:57:30,351 --> 00:57:31,712
Any other questions from the board?

529
00:57:38,102 --> 00:57:40,897
Okay, I believe all the questions I had.

530
00:57:42,227 --> 00:57:46,451
Well, I just wanted to since nobody else jumped in, I just wanted to piggyback a little bit on what Chris was saying.

531
00:57:46,471 --> 00:57:50,554
I'm glad Chris made that comment because I do think there might be an opportunity here.

532
00:57:50,834 --> 00:58:02,504
Frankly, I'm a little tired of all the like the wood frame buildings that the apartment complexes that are I have to say very similar kind of characteristics to them.

533
00:58:02,644 --> 00:58:08,029
And I think there might be an opportunity here to do something that's that's different and exciting for.

534
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:17,933
I do think it's probably one of the few places in the city that would be really appropriate for maybe a taller building.

535
00:58:19,053 --> 00:58:25,795
Maybe a taller building, but a smaller footprint, which would allow some other things to happen around it.

536
00:58:26,775 --> 00:58:28,276
Just something to consider.

537
00:58:28,336 --> 00:58:33,137
Also, since you have 93 right there, the higher up you go, the more you get the river views.

538
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:39,222
Anyways, I think there's conversation to have there.

539
00:58:39,302 --> 00:58:42,723
I'd love to see some different imaginings of the site.

540
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,546
Thank you, Andrew.

541
00:58:51,327 --> 00:59:01,372
So for myself, I do echo Mike's feedback about the documents that we have available to us.

542
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:07,171
We definitely want to see improvement on that content.

543
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:11,796
And I think the feedback from the city and the peer reviewers will give us what we need there.

544
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:20,805
With regards to Chris and Andre's comments, I will also echo the opportunity that we have.

545
00:59:21,806 --> 00:59:22,808
Obviously, the

546
00:59:25,298 --> 00:59:30,681
sense of engagement is something that we as a community are looking for those opportunities.

547
00:59:31,462 --> 00:59:38,146
And where those buildings that we've looked at have been wood frame, that has been a challenge.

548
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:49,192
Where this is metal frame, changing the design, going up or providing some other capabilities at the street level would be interesting.

549
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:50,093
And

550
00:59:51,182 --> 00:59:59,990
I think that's something that we'd like to see considered as we move forward to see what opportunities you would have there.

551
01:00:03,673 --> 01:00:06,656
All right.

552
01:00:06,716 --> 01:00:08,777
I think that is it.

553
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,139
I will move to open public comment.

554
01:00:14,302 --> 01:00:16,164
Motion to open public comment.

555
01:00:18,306 --> 01:00:18,606
Second.

556
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:20,899
Thank you.

557
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,021
Roll call.

558
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:23,661
Mike Caldera.

559
01:00:24,982 --> 01:00:25,142
Aye.

560
01:00:26,903 --> 01:00:27,443
Jim Tarani.

561
01:00:28,184 --> 01:00:28,344
Aye.

562
01:00:29,705 --> 01:00:30,245
Andrew LaRue.

563
01:00:30,906 --> 01:00:31,046
Aye.

564
01:00:32,107 --> 01:00:32,627
Mary Lee.

565
01:00:35,209 --> 01:00:35,329
Aye.

566
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:37,070
Kristie Rivera.

567
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:38,331
Aye.

568
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:40,132
And Jamie Thompson.

569
01:00:40,152 --> 01:00:40,452
Aye.

570
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,480
We are open for public comment.

571
01:00:44,981 --> 01:00:55,769
If anybody has any questions, comments, please raise your hand and Zoom, or you can email Dennis at dmcdougall at medford-ma.gov.

572
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:57,951
I'll put that in the chat as well.

573
01:00:59,412 --> 01:01:07,618
I'll give that a minute.

574
01:01:07,698 --> 01:01:11,621
While we wait for that, I don't see any hands up yet.

575
01:01:13,642 --> 01:01:16,943
I'll wait until afterwards when we go to deliberation.

576
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:31,106
Jamie, I'll motion to close public comment on this session of the hearing.

577
01:01:31,126 --> 01:01:35,306
Do we have a second?

578
01:01:36,007 --> 01:01:36,547
I'll second.

579
01:01:37,787 --> 01:01:38,167
Thank you.

580
01:01:39,027 --> 01:01:39,407
Roll call.

581
01:01:39,507 --> 01:01:40,047
Andrea Leroux?

582
01:01:41,268 --> 01:01:41,388
Aye.

583
01:01:42,508 --> 01:01:42,908
Mary Lee?

584
01:01:44,068 --> 01:01:48,291
I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I.

585
01:02:13,047 --> 01:02:19,733
I haven't had, I actually just asked Aditi to remind me to follow up on that when I'm in the office tomorrow.

586
01:02:20,533 --> 01:02:21,554
So I'll let you know.

587
01:02:21,574 --> 01:02:26,018
I appreciate it.

588
01:02:26,158 --> 01:02:26,638
All right.

589
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:32,023
So I guess the discussion at the moment is next steps.

590
01:02:32,103 --> 01:02:32,803
Andre, go ahead.

591
01:02:34,545 --> 01:02:37,787
This is maybe a point of inquiry for the city director.

592
01:02:40,617 --> 01:02:57,148
Wondering what the kind of the latest city planning documents are for this area so that as we consider this project, we maybe can take that into that account and whether you consider that those are those are up to date or not.

593
01:02:57,808 --> 01:02:59,870
I know that's changed over the last few years.

594
01:03:01,263 --> 01:03:11,209
So we do have in the comprehensive plan, there was not what one would call a study of this area, but we did do a lot of asking questions of people about this area.

595
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:20,914
And there is either a page off the top of my head, either a page or a half page that addresses Mystic Ave and sort of what people would like to see there.

596
01:03:21,554 --> 01:03:24,576
There was definitely appetite for

597
01:03:25,396 --> 01:03:30,278
taller buildings, you know, more density on Mystic Ave, especially on the highway side.

598
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:32,840
There is some reasonable place, right?

599
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:39,243
Like the tallest building in Medford right now, I am pretty certain is about 120 feet.

600
01:03:40,303 --> 01:03:42,664
I actually don't know how tall this one proposed is.

601
01:03:42,684 --> 01:03:53,990
I would like, I actually am thinking, so there was some work done sort of studying Mystic Ave prior to my taking over as director, but I was familiar with it.

602
01:03:56,154 --> 01:03:57,295
Let me take a look at that.

603
01:03:57,455 --> 01:04:07,283
I also had a study done back as the sustainability director about green infrastructure opportunities on Mystic Ave as part of a redevelopment.

604
01:04:09,185 --> 01:04:13,508
Maybe I'll ask Aditi and I to take a look at those over the next couple of days.

605
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:21,955
If it seems that they're in line, they predate the comprehensive plan, but if they're in line with what we heard at the comprehensive plan, I'll send those over.

606
01:04:21,975 --> 01:04:23,196
Great.

607
01:04:23,216 --> 01:04:23,456
Thank you.

608
01:04:27,991 --> 01:04:56,485
Yeah, Jamie, I'd like to motion to authorize the city to retain peer review consultants for the architecture and design, the civil engineering, and the traffic considerations for the building, and also to authorize the city and the proponent to engage in direct working sessions without board participation between now and our next meeting.

609
01:04:57,145 --> 01:05:00,147
meeting to iterate on the plans.

610
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:05,269
I'd second that.

611
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:07,510
Thank you.

612
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:09,271
Roll call vote?

613
01:05:11,472 --> 01:05:12,893
Actually, any discussion on those topics?

614
01:05:13,093 --> 01:05:13,934
Fine.

615
01:05:14,874 --> 01:05:15,594
From anybody else?

616
01:05:19,817 --> 01:05:21,037
Okay, we'll do a roll call.

617
01:05:21,698 --> 01:05:22,198
Mike Caldera?

618
01:05:22,858 --> 01:05:23,018
Aye.

619
01:05:24,739 --> 01:05:25,259
Mary Lee?

620
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:26,460
Aye.

621
01:05:27,689 --> 01:05:28,229
Andre LeRoux.

622
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:29,110
Aye.

623
01:05:30,471 --> 01:05:31,051
Jim Torani.

624
01:05:31,911 --> 01:05:32,072
Aye.

625
01:05:33,172 --> 01:05:33,873
Chris D'Avena.

626
01:05:35,073 --> 01:05:35,193
Aye.

627
01:05:36,534 --> 01:05:37,215
Jamie Thompson.

628
01:05:37,395 --> 01:05:37,555
Aye.

629
01:05:43,718 --> 01:05:45,439
Any other items from the board?

630
01:05:45,499 --> 01:05:52,043
I know we have to, the next item from an agenda perspective is obviously to determine the next meeting date.

631
01:05:52,203 --> 01:05:55,525
Before we go to that item, is there any other topics that anybody wants to bring up?

632
01:06:02,563 --> 01:06:03,583
Okay.

633
01:06:04,303 --> 01:06:15,906
I know we looked at the calendar for next meeting and considering that we're looking at a lot of document updates, I know we have the traffic study to do.

634
01:06:16,466 --> 01:06:18,107
We have to get the peer reviewers on board.

635
01:06:18,127 --> 01:06:24,588
I know a month from now, we'd be looking at Memorial Day.

636
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:30,850
If we looked at May 28th, I think that we'd have to add a minimum go to

637
01:06:32,392 --> 01:06:32,652
June 4th.

638
01:06:32,712 --> 01:06:34,333
We're looking at a Tuesday.

639
01:06:34,353 --> 01:06:51,422
Typically these meetings run a little longer, so I would prefer not to have the next meeting on the regularly scheduled meeting unless we thought that we were going to be doing a quick update before scheduling the next deep dive.

640
01:06:53,063 --> 01:07:00,107
So I guess for discussion, thoughts on

641
01:07:02,164 --> 01:07:05,394
a full meeting scheduled for the 4th or later.

642
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:06,097
Mike?

643
01:07:07,546 --> 01:07:12,007
Yeah, Jamie, I totally understand your position on this.

644
01:07:12,687 --> 01:07:22,090
I do have some reservations in light of the updates that need to happen, the discussions that need to happen.

645
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:31,372
It does take some time to actually retain and pay for the peer review consultants, and they're going to be requesting information.

646
01:07:31,472 --> 01:07:33,553
So I really want to make sure that

647
01:07:34,773 --> 01:07:44,457
When we're next meeting, there's been an opportunity to have those discussions and actually add detail to the plans and update the plans.

648
01:07:44,537 --> 01:07:49,419
And I'm not convinced that early June gets us there.

649
01:07:49,519 --> 01:08:00,703
So just weighing in to say it would be my preference, even though I understand there's downsides, to continue this to the June 27th regular meeting.

650
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:17,567
And then we'll have an opportunity when we meet in May if things are moving along more quickly to maybe schedule an earlier meeting and reconsider.

651
01:08:17,587 --> 01:08:24,531
But I really do expect to see updates at our next session.

652
01:08:24,551 --> 01:08:29,734
And so I think the 27th of June gives time for that.

653
01:08:33,095 --> 01:08:35,977
That makes sense.

654
01:08:36,698 --> 01:08:38,319
Sorry just for discussion there.

655
01:08:38,539 --> 01:08:42,882
My only concern is like our last regular meeting went so long.

656
01:08:43,403 --> 01:08:49,067
Putting this at the same time might be problematic.

657
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:53,370
So I just to hear what maybe what the staff, city staff thinks about that.

658
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:56,372
Director Hunt.

659
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:02,108
Thank you, and actually I was about to raise my hand with a thought before even Andre said that.

660
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:21,217
So if we realize that things are moving along quickly, and we have, say, continued this to the next regular meeting in June, you know, to the end of June, but we realize in May that things are moving along quicker than we expected, I don't think we legally could

661
01:09:22,137 --> 01:09:27,200
open the hearing reopen the hearing earlier than that, because we have to continue to a date and time certain.

662
01:09:27,940 --> 01:09:36,785
So I have a workaround to suggest what if you literally continued this to the date and time certain of your next.

663
01:09:37,505 --> 01:09:50,448
regularly scheduled meeting at the end of May with the understanding for all the parties that it's not anticipated to actually hear any testimony, have any public comment, but rather that that's a scheduling meeting.

664
01:09:51,128 --> 01:09:57,849
Rather, you'll take your regular agenda and there'll be just a check-in to see where do we stand with the review of the consultants?

665
01:09:58,189 --> 01:09:59,389
Do we need one more week?

666
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:00,850
Do we need three more weeks?

667
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:02,190
Do we need six more weeks?

668
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:12,378
And then at that point, you could schedule something either for June or July, because my gut is it's going to be hard to get a quorum of the board in July.

669
01:10:12,398 --> 01:10:13,839
There are going to be many meetings.

670
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:19,564
You really want to have everybody whenever possible so that you don't lose people to the Mullen rule.

671
01:10:22,166 --> 01:10:24,187
It's just a thought off the top of my head.

672
01:10:26,806 --> 01:10:27,646
I think that's reasonable.

673
01:10:27,726 --> 01:10:33,088
We know we won't be ready for presentations, but it's a good opportunity to check in and coordinate the schedule.

674
01:10:34,888 --> 01:10:36,489
How does the board feel about a.

675
01:10:37,449 --> 01:10:40,210
30th scheduling time slot.

676
01:10:42,311 --> 01:10:46,532
I'm going to motion to continue this matter to.

677
01:10:48,047 --> 01:11:02,175
May 30th at 6.30 for the purpose of a status update and discussion of the schedule for the rest of the hearing.

678
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:07,838
Jim, you're on mute.

679
01:11:08,059 --> 01:11:08,419
Second.

680
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,701
Thank you, Jim.

681
01:11:12,461 --> 01:11:12,941
Roll call.

682
01:11:13,161 --> 01:11:13,702
Andre in the room.

683
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:14,682
Aye.

684
01:11:16,163 --> 01:11:16,703
Jim Tarani.

685
01:11:17,424 --> 01:11:17,544
Aye.

686
01:11:18,838 --> 01:11:19,478
Mike Caldera?

687
01:11:20,119 --> 01:11:20,219
Aye.

688
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:22,380
Mary Lee?

689
01:11:23,561 --> 01:11:23,661
Aye.

690
01:11:25,682 --> 01:11:26,362
And Christy Aveda?

691
01:11:27,703 --> 01:11:27,843
Aye.

692
01:11:29,464 --> 01:11:30,104
Jamie Thompson?

693
01:11:30,124 --> 01:11:30,464
Aye.

694
01:11:33,246 --> 01:11:35,807
Jamie, can I ask a question?

695
01:11:36,028 --> 01:11:42,471
If it's noticed and the public is obviously notified of the notice,

696
01:11:45,586 --> 01:11:55,308
Does it specify in the notice that it's a discussion or it's an update versus a public comment?

697
01:11:56,769 --> 01:11:57,229
Director Hunt?

698
01:11:58,749 --> 01:12:08,292
So to clarify, the legal public noticing for this hearing, this project, has actually already occurred and was for tonight.

699
01:12:09,372 --> 01:12:13,433
It's actually, it's interesting, there are not really very many members of the public here tonight.

700
01:12:14,873 --> 01:12:19,775
So we would not be putting it in the paper again, doing separate notices for it.

701
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:24,937
The way it would be, quote, noticed would be that it will be in the next agenda.

702
01:12:25,417 --> 01:12:31,480
And Dennis can put a little bit of text there that says scheduling update.

703
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:38,763
But anybody who actually wants to follow when will the next meeting want would want to tune in just for the scheduling update.

704
01:12:38,783 --> 01:12:40,503
Does that sort of answer your question?

705
01:12:45,445 --> 01:12:46,045
Thank you, director.

706
01:12:52,549 --> 01:12:56,952
So next steps to bring all the peer reviewers on board.

707
01:12:59,093 --> 01:13:03,696
Mr. Mayatta, you can work with city staff to coordinate the process for that.

708
01:13:03,716 --> 01:13:06,978
Do you have any questions for us going forward?

709
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:11,220
Oh, this is very helpful.

710
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:14,222
And thank you again, everybody, for your time this evening.

711
01:13:17,437 --> 01:13:18,918
All right.

712
01:13:21,219 --> 01:13:22,439
Chair awaits a motion to adjourn.

713
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,301
Motion to adjourn.

714
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:27,602
Just a point of order.

715
01:13:27,642 --> 01:13:30,123
We've still got two items on the agenda.

716
01:13:30,163 --> 01:13:32,064
Oh, I apologize.

717
01:13:33,805 --> 01:13:34,745
Thank you.

718
01:13:34,985 --> 01:13:35,325
Dennis?

719
01:13:38,347 --> 01:13:38,767
No updates.

720
01:13:39,287 --> 01:13:42,889
We've sort of gone over everything and there are no meeting minutes because this is the first meeting.

721
01:13:42,909 --> 01:13:45,130
So we wouldn't have any.

722
01:13:46,653 --> 01:13:47,733
but we're fine.

723
01:13:47,813 --> 01:13:53,794
Yeah, I mean, we've got the notice, we got the, just the peer reviewers have sent us their thing.

724
01:13:54,294 --> 01:14:01,696
And on Friday I sent the design and I realized today that it would be designed when it was in my outgoing mail.

725
01:14:01,716 --> 01:14:02,856
So I just sent it to Chris.

726
01:14:03,076 --> 01:14:06,116
I just sent it to you tonight, the information about the design.

727
01:14:06,156 --> 01:14:08,197
So you have that, so we can get forward on that.

728
01:14:08,217 --> 01:14:14,838
Okay.

729
01:14:15,058 --> 01:14:15,518
Thank you, Dennis.

730
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:22,031
Motion to adjourn.

731
01:14:23,573 --> 01:14:24,033
Thank you, Mike.

732
01:14:24,774 --> 01:14:27,516
Roll call.

733
01:14:28,056 --> 01:14:28,477
Mary Lee.

734
01:14:29,758 --> 01:14:29,878
Aye.

735
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:31,459
Kristi Avenna.

736
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:32,900
Aye.

737
01:14:34,021 --> 01:14:34,582
Jim Tirani.

738
01:14:34,602 --> 01:14:35,382
Aye.

739
01:14:35,402 --> 01:14:37,044
Sandra LaRue.

740
01:14:37,784 --> 01:14:37,904
Aye.

741
01:14:38,985 --> 01:14:39,606
Mike Caldara.

742
01:14:40,206 --> 01:14:40,306
Aye.

743
01:14:41,447 --> 01:14:42,188
And Jamie Thompson.

744
01:14:42,308 --> 01:14:42,408
Aye.

745
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:46,271
Thank you for everybody joining us tonight.

746
01:14:46,311 --> 01:14:47,152
Appreciate the presentation.
