31
00:02:45,328 --> 00:03:04,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Massachusetts, acting pursuant to the powers provided by Chapter 639 of the Acts of 1950 and Section 2A of Chapter 17 of the General Laws declare that there now exists in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts a state of emergency due to outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus COVID-19.

32
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:10,430
[SPEAKER_17]: And whereas many important functions of state and local government are executed by public bodies,

33
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:28,362
[SPEAKER_17]: As the term is defined in general law, chapter 30A, section 18, in meetings that are open to the public, consistent with requirements of law and sound public policy, and in order to ensure active public engagement with contributions to and oversight of the functions of government and

34
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:46,909
[SPEAKER_17]: whereas both the Federal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, and Massachusetts Department of Public Health, DPH, have advised residents to take extra measures to put distance between themselves and other people to further reduce the risk of being exposed to COVID-19.

39
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:30,023
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry?

40
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:32,024
[SPEAKER_02]: You froze for a second.

41
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:32,665
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

42
00:04:33,886 --> 00:04:47,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Whereas low-cost telephones, social media, and other internet-based technologies are currently available that will permit the convening of a public body through virtual means and allow real-time public access to the activities of the public body.

43
00:04:48,467 --> 00:05:00,577
[SPEAKER_17]: and whereas Section 20 of Chapter 30A in implementing regulations issued by the Attorney General currently authorized remote participation by members of a public body subject to certain limitations.

44
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:04,761
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, therefore, I hereby order the following.

45
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:15,349
[SPEAKER_17]: One, a public body as defined in Section 18 of Chapter 30A of the general laws is hereby relieved from the requirement of Section 20 of Chapter 30A

46
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:32,026
[SPEAKER_17]: that it conduct its meetings in a public place that is open and physically accessible to the public, provided that the public body makes provisions to ensure public access to the deliberations of the public body for interested members of the public through adequate alternative means.

47
00:05:32,977 --> 00:05:43,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Adequate alternative means of public access shall mean measures that provide transparency and permit timely and effective public access to the deliberations of the public body.

48
00:05:44,026 --> 00:06:01,760
[SPEAKER_17]: Such means may include, without limitation, providing public access through telephone, internet, or satellites-enabled audio or video conferencing, or any other technology that enables the public to clearly follow the proceedings of the public body while those activities are occurring.

49
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:17,181
[SPEAKER_17]: where allowance for active real-time participation by members of the public is a specific requirement of a general or special law or regulation or a local ordinance or bylaw pursuant to which the proceeding is conducted.

50
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:22,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Any alternative means of public access must provide for such participation.

51
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:50,692
[SPEAKER_17]: A municipal public body that, for reasons of economic hardship and despite best efforts, is unable to provide alternative means of public access that will enable the public to follow the proceedings of the municipal public body as those activities are occurring in real time, may instead post on its municipal website a full and complete transcript, recording, or other comprehensive record of the proceedings as soon as practicable

52
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,791
[SPEAKER_17]: upon conclusion of the proceedings.

53
00:06:55,831 --> 00:07:09,315
[SPEAKER_17]: The paragraph shall not apply to proceedings that are conducted pursuant to a general or special law or regulation or a law ordinance or bylaw that requires allowance for active participation by members of the public.

54
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:18,738
[SPEAKER_17]: A public body must operate selected alternative means of access to its proceedings without subscription toll or similar charge to the public.

55
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:26,349
[SPEAKER_17]: Number two, public bodies are hereby authorized to allow remote participation by all members in any meeting of the public body.

56
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:36,757
[SPEAKER_17]: The requirement that a quorum of the body and the chair be physically present at a specified meeting location as provided in general law, chapter 38, section 20D and in 940 CMR 29.104B is hereby suspended.

57
00:07:44,721 --> 00:08:06,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Number three, a public body that elects to conduct its proceedings under the relief provided in sections one or two above shall ensure that any party entitled or required to appear before it shall be able to through remote means as if the party were a member of the public body and participating remotely as provided in section two.

58
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:21,100
[SPEAKER_17]: All other provisions of Section 18 to 25 of Chapter 30A and the Attorney General's implementing regulations shall otherwise remain unchanged and fully applicable to the activities of public bodies.

59
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:29,407
[SPEAKER_17]: This order is effective immediately and shall remain in effect until rescinded or until the state of emergency is terminated, whichever happens first.

60
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:42,299
[SPEAKER_17]: So at the last meeting we had last week, we had a hearing that was tabled and that was 20-084.

61
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:45,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Would someone like to make a motion to take that from the table?

62
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to take that from the table, Mr. President.

68
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,061
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, President Falco, it was tabled to a date certain, so it's automatically coming off the table anyway.

69
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:07,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, okay, then we don't have to take them both then, right?

70
00:09:08,062 --> 00:09:08,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

71
00:09:08,402 --> 00:09:11,082

112
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:17,537

00:12:17,677 --> 00:12:19,358

00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:29,103

[SPEAKER_17]: There are none.

116
00:12:31,424 --> 00:12:32,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Clerk Hurtubise.

117
00:12:32,944 --> 00:12:35,766
[SPEAKER_17]: Hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

118
00:12:36,853 --> 00:12:44,135
[SPEAKER_17]: At this time, I'll recognize the chairperson on licensing, Councilor Scarpelli.

119
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:45,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Council President.

120
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:51,436
[SPEAKER_15]: We reviewed all the paperwork and documents that are needed.

121
00:12:51,496 --> 00:12:52,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything seems to be in order.

122
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:56,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Before we move on, could Ms.

123
00:12:56,177 --> 00:13:02,759
[SPEAKER_15]: Burrell give us a little, for the people that don't know what we do at that site, could you just give us a little insight and we'll go from there.

124
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:17,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so and bakery, um, we're opening a little small bakery, uh, 17 place that road is actually right across the street from the commuter rail that goes into Boston.

125
00:13:17,272 --> 00:13:28,556
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the reason that we were petitioning to open at 6am instead of seven, um, is because so that we could maybe be able to service.

126
00:13:29,316 --> 00:13:35,437
[SPEAKER_11]: more customers that were going into Boston that have to go into work at an earlier time.

127
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:38,898
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the reason that we wanted to open up the hour early.

128
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:53,961
[SPEAKER_11]: I put down six and we just put down for every day because when we first opened, which with what's happening now, we definitely have been pushed back and

129
00:13:57,257 --> 00:13:59,339
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had a lot of setbacks.

130
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:06,965
[SPEAKER_11]: I, myself, actually had a brain tumor removed in November, hence the little hat.

131
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:10,147
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've had setbacks.

132
00:14:10,347 --> 00:14:15,791
[SPEAKER_11]: And now this, so we don't know when our opening date is actually going to be.

133
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:26,260
[SPEAKER_11]: But when we do open, we plan to be open every day just to see what our busy day is, what's our slowest day.

134
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,802
[SPEAKER_11]: and then change our schedule accordingly.

135
00:14:30,822 --> 00:14:35,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so I see all the paperwork in order, Mr. President.

136
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:41,469
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that we have other very similar establishments that are open at that time.

137
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:49,494
[SPEAKER_15]: So sense of fairness, I think it just, it would be feasible that we move forward with this in favor.

138
00:14:49,554 --> 00:14:54,997
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know my fellow colleagues will have some questions, but I would move for approval.

139
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:58,266
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Knight.

140
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:04,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I certainly have no problem with this paper that's before us this evening.

141
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:05,349
[SPEAKER_08]: I live right down the street.

142
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,910
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very tough location, and I wish you the best of luck there.

143
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

144
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:27,134
[SPEAKER_08]: However, Mr. President, I do feel it will be appropriate for us to put a condition on the special permit that would grant the extended hours to the business, but not to the property address.

145
00:15:27,254 --> 00:15:28,915
[SPEAKER_08]: So in case there is a change.

146
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:32,877
[SPEAKER_08]: that application.

147
00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:40,943
[SPEAKER_08]: The next business would have to, or the successor business would have to petition the council for extent that it operates as well.

148
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:46,567
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the amendment that I'd often misrepresent.

149
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:53,532
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a conditional thing that goes with the business, not the property address.

150
00:15:53,992 --> 00:15:54,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

151
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:55,734
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Council.

152
00:15:55,934 --> 00:15:56,894
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knights.

153
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,511
[SPEAKER_17]: that is what I have as well.

154
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,162
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not, but I certainly wouldn't be opposed to it.

155
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:38,244
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

156
00:16:38,504 --> 00:16:40,125
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, I'll make that amendment that.

157
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:41,606
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

158
00:16:41,706 --> 00:16:44,307
[SPEAKER_17]: Amended by councilor Scarpelli for 90 day review.

159
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:46,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice president.

160
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:48,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

161
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I am supported this, uh, Carla.

162
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:59,456
[SPEAKER_04]: My only question is, um, why didn't you ask for five o'clock similar to, uh, Dunkin' Donuts to Magnificent Muffin and, uh, the other establishments over there.

163
00:16:59,837 --> 00:17:01,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're trying to capitalize on the, uh,

164
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:04,748
[SPEAKER_04]: the train traffic for the communities in the morning.

165
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:07,830
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other establishments are open at five.

166
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:15,796
[SPEAKER_11]: So well, actually, honestly, I didn't know what time those establishments opened.

167
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:23,922
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not usually there at that time to see what time they're opened.

168
00:17:25,323 --> 00:17:28,225
[SPEAKER_11]: I just thought that six o'clock would be okay.

169
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:28,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I

170
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:38,587
[SPEAKER_11]: can I be open at five or that's a whole new, that would be a whole new letter and a whole new, in the newspaper.

171
00:17:38,607 --> 00:17:39,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Originally, I was gonna ask.

172
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:50,015
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start with six and see where it goes, but the other businesses are all, Dunkin' is open at five, Magnificent Muffin opens at five, and I think Paul Revere is open at five also.

173
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:59,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, so I guess the people that are there early for five are gonna get like bad coffee, and then the people that can come at six will get some good coffee.

174
00:18:02,652 --> 00:18:08,296
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am in full support of this, Mr. President, and welcome to the neighborhood, because I am a resident of that neighborhood also.

175
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:09,797
[SPEAKER_04]: So welcome to the neighborhood.

176
00:18:09,817 --> 00:18:10,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope to see you soon.

177
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:11,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

178
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:13,679
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

179
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:15,600
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions from the councilors?

180
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,662
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't move approval.

181
00:18:19,283 --> 00:18:19,683
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

182
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:25,827
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by?

183
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:27,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Second, Mr. President.

[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor, Vice President Caraviello, as amended by Councilor Knight.

[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks, you still there?

194
00:18:51,972 --> 00:18:53,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Hang on.

195
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:54,373
[SPEAKER_16]: He was having trouble.

196
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:54,953
[SPEAKER_16]: He was muted.

197
00:18:54,973 --> 00:18:58,414
[SPEAKER_16]: You got him?

198
00:18:59,074 --> 00:18:59,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:00,734
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell?

00:19:01,678 --> 00:19:01,918
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli?

00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:04,599
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_16]: President Falco?

204
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:06,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

205
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,201
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

206
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:13,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Congratulations, good luck.

207
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

208
00:19:15,203 --> 00:19:16,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Stay safe.

209
00:19:16,524 --> 00:19:16,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

210
00:19:17,344 --> 00:19:18,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, you as well.

211
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:19,105
[SPEAKER_17]: See you soon.

212
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:20,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck.

213
00:19:21,826 --> 00:19:22,946
[SPEAKER_11]: Should I stay on?

214
00:19:22,966 --> 00:19:24,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you can go if you'd like.

215
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:26,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Only if you want to.

216
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,908
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be riveting.

217
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:28,709
[SPEAKER_17]: You're all done.

218
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:33,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Everyone's welcome.

219
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:37,352
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, thank you very much.

220
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:38,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

221
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:38,594
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a good night.

222
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:38,994
[SPEAKER_17]: Good luck.

223
00:19:39,775 --> 00:19:40,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Bye bye.

224
00:19:42,317 --> 00:19:44,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

225
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:55,370
[SPEAKER_17]: 20-042 offered by Councilor Morell, whereas the City of Medford currently exercising the local option for tax deferments

226
00:19:55,907 --> 00:20:00,988
[SPEAKER_17]: in accordance with Mass General Law, Chapter 59, Chapter 5, Paragraph 41A.

227
00:20:02,128 --> 00:20:10,070
[SPEAKER_17]: And whereas the upper income limit set by the City of Medford for eligible residents 65 and over is $20,000 per year.

228
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:19,793
[SPEAKER_17]: The result of this, Medford City Council discussed raising the income limit to better reflect the cost of living, the cost of living and housing in Medford.

229
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:21,013
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Morell.

230
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:30,246
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President, just since this was reprinted just from the original meeting where I had the erroneous information the current cap is at 40,000.

231
00:20:31,006 --> 00:20:43,455
[SPEAKER_10]: But in short, this is a program, as you read it allows seniors meeting certain criteria and the city, and under an income cap to defer their real estate taxes until they either sell their home or pass away.

232
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:50,914
[SPEAKER_10]: And currently our cap sits at $40,000, and the idea was to raise this.

233
00:20:50,954 --> 00:20:56,359
[SPEAKER_10]: We're able to raise this as high as the senior circuit breaker tax income credit.

234
00:20:56,679 --> 00:20:59,841
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe for fiscal year 21, that would be $60,000.

235
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:05,686
[SPEAKER_10]: We, by voting on this now, would go into effect for fiscal year 21.

236
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,810
[SPEAKER_10]: So it came up last year, last year, last week, the idea of a $50,000 cap.

237
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:14,233
[SPEAKER_10]: I think originally we were all thinking of doing more, but in light of

238
00:21:15,364 --> 00:21:17,165
[SPEAKER_10]: to raise the cap to $50,000 for fiscal year 21.

239
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:52,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, on the motion of Council Morell to raise the cap to $50,000, seconded by Councilor Bears.

240
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:54,431
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any questions from the council?

241
00:21:57,473 --> 00:21:59,595
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, no questions.

242
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:01,596
[SPEAKER_17]: Would anyone else have questions?

243
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:02,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, let's see.

244
00:22:03,658 --> 00:22:03,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

245
00:22:03,838 --> 00:22:04,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Cameron.

246
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:06,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

247
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm sorry, Councilor Knight goes first and then we'll go to Roberta Cameron.

248
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:17,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I certainly have no problem raising the deferment cap.

249
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:22,915
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something that we talked about back in 2019, I do believe as well.

250
00:22:24,096 --> 00:22:38,122
[SPEAKER_08]: The question that I do pose is this, is this paper offered in the proper form for us to adopt it this evening, or is there specific length which required per the division of local services that needs to be adopted in order to raise the cap?

251
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:41,264
[SPEAKER_17]: Good question, Councilor Morell,

252
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:51,299
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, as the statute is written, it says just, it says by a vote of the council alderman, whatever.

253
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:58,028
[SPEAKER_10]: I spoke, the clerk has his hand up.

254
00:22:58,909 --> 00:22:59,950
[SPEAKER_16]: I can interrupt for a second.

255
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:02,512
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe Ms.

256
00:23:02,552 --> 00:23:12,918
[SPEAKER_16]: Burdeaux last week at the committee, the whole put that into proper form when she suggested how the motion should be made.

257
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:17,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks made that motion in the committee report and you voted it out.

258
00:23:17,841 --> 00:23:18,881
[SPEAKER_16]: You voted on it in committee.

259
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:21,983
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you vote to adopt the committee report, I believe you should be

260
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:23,944
[SPEAKER_16]: to adopt the committee report.

261
00:23:23,964 --> 00:23:26,044
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it should be all set in terms of adopting it one way or the other.

262
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:31,827
[SPEAKER_16]: If you want to use the suspenders and belts approach, you can pass the resolution tonight and adopt the committee report.

263
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:32,987
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it should be all set either way.

264
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:40,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilmember Morell, did you want to comment further on that?

265
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:59,258
[SPEAKER_10]: But as I said, as the state statutes ran it, the wording I believe is by a vote of, it can be said by a vote of.

266
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:18,673
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually fairly kind of a... I was just gonna say if we wanna pass this resolution and then we have the committee reports at the end of the meeting to the correct point, whether it's through the...

267
00:24:19,198 --> 00:24:23,120
[SPEAKER_10]: this resolution or adopting the committee report, it seems like we should have our bases covered.

268
00:24:24,521 --> 00:24:25,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

269
00:24:25,962 --> 00:24:26,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

270
00:24:28,503 --> 00:24:29,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a question.

271
00:24:29,203 --> 00:24:30,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

272
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:31,164
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, thank you, Councilor Knight.

273
00:24:31,985 --> 00:24:32,565
[SPEAKER_17]: Roberta Cameron.

274
00:24:35,564 --> 00:24:35,804
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello.

275
00:24:36,104 --> 00:24:36,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

276
00:24:37,805 --> 00:24:53,292
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to suggest that if the participation rate in this program is currently very low, I wonder if the city could do more to increase the participation rate besides just increasing the income levels, but also maybe

277
00:24:55,117 --> 00:25:02,179
[SPEAKER_12]: sharing the availability of this program and helping people to understand what the implications of the program are.

278
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:17,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I understand that there are downsides to participating, but there are also benefits and it's better than some of the alternatives that people have used in the past who are having difficulty paying their property taxes.

279
00:25:18,403 --> 00:25:24,826
[SPEAKER_12]: so that it would be a more beneficial program than say a reverse mortgage, which people have used.

280
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:26,307
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would be helpful.

281
00:25:26,347 --> 00:25:33,990
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to see the city to take additional measures to increase the participation rate.

282
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:34,930
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all.

283
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

284
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:36,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

285
00:25:36,031 --> 00:25:36,791
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Morell.

286
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:38,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

287
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:46,476
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd be happy to add a B paper that when this is set and finalized, that it go out in the next send of real estate,

288
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:51,696
[SPEAKER_10]: tax bills, a notification that this program does exist in the deadline.

289
00:25:51,716 --> 00:26:01,725
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't, maybe it would be too soon to send in the next one as the deadline is April 1st of next year, but just actually including that with a future set of bills.

290
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:08,452
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have the language on the B paper?

291
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:10,346
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm working on the language.

292
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:11,747
[SPEAKER_16]: I need a little clarification.

293
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:17,531
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell, you wanted to go out in a future meeting, but not necessarily in a future mailing, but not necessarily the next future mailing.

294
00:26:18,191 --> 00:26:18,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

295
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:19,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

296
00:26:19,352 --> 00:26:22,834
[SPEAKER_10]: And it honestly, it might get lost during this time anyway.

297
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:25,616
[SPEAKER_10]: So perhaps closer to when the deadline is for the program.

298
00:26:26,057 --> 00:26:26,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Got that.

299
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:28,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

300
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:29,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks.

301
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,482
[SPEAKER_13]: I would support that increased notification

302
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:37,489
[SPEAKER_13]: as well as adding all the other exemptions that currently exist as well.

303
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:47,880
[SPEAKER_13]: So it wouldn't be just the deferment that goes out, it'd be the senior property tax exemption, it would be the disabled property tax exemption.

304
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,743
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe there's one for the blind, there's four or five of them out there.

305
00:26:51,163 --> 00:26:53,626
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would ask that they all be sent out as well if that's all right.

306
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,549
[SPEAKER_17]: That sounds good, that's a great idea, thank you.

307
00:26:59,053 --> 00:27:03,075
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other comments from the Council with regard to the motion or the B paper?

308
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,476
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Caraviello.

309
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:06,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

310
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:16,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I support the along with Councilor Miles amendment so that we do have all the options available to them.

311
00:27:16,723 --> 00:27:23,287
[SPEAKER_04]: With the next real estate tax bill, because we just saw last week.

312
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there what was the date that this had to be uh applied for?

313
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:32,885
[SPEAKER_10]: The deadline's actually april 1st of next year.

314
00:27:32,905 --> 00:27:52,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so if we sent it out in the next tax bill, everybody should have a correct That's the bill that everybody gets that owns homes Yeah, and it may be I mean i'm fine leaving uh it as um, just saying a future bill and perhaps deferring to the assessors when it would be

315
00:27:53,022 --> 00:27:57,343
[SPEAKER_10]: be most beneficial or there's not other stuff that has to go out as well to send it out.

316
00:27:58,863 --> 00:28:05,925
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we can conjecture as far as what people might do if they get it in there six months from now, whether they'll lose that paper and forget about it.

317
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:10,806
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd be happy to just defer to the administration.

318
00:28:12,226 --> 00:28:13,526
[SPEAKER_13]: This is only a recommendation.

319
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:14,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

320
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:14,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

321
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:15,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

322
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,047
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

323
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:20,288
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions from the council?

324
00:28:22,448 --> 00:28:26,271
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, any other questions from anyone that's, oh, yes, down here.

325
00:28:28,052 --> 00:28:29,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

326
00:28:42,162 --> 00:28:43,683
[SPEAKER_03]: We aren't able to hear you.

327
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:46,484
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we can't hear you.

328
00:28:47,745 --> 00:28:48,506
[SPEAKER_18]: I am muted too.

329
00:28:54,295 --> 00:28:55,015
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't hear you.

330
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:56,436
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that Dennis?

331
00:28:57,656 --> 00:28:58,096
[SPEAKER_18]: I think so.

332
00:28:58,796 --> 00:29:10,759
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

333
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe if he could send someone an email with his question.

334
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,620
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

335
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:21,002
[SPEAKER_13]: If you'd like to send an email to the clerk or yourself or anyone he's familiar with.

336
00:29:21,608 --> 00:29:24,089
[SPEAKER_16]: Or you can also try to chat the question.

337
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:26,470
[SPEAKER_17]: Dennis, can you try to chat the question?

338
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,532
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't had anybody do that yet.

339
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:43,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, while we're waiting, is there anyone else with a question?

340
00:29:43,797 --> 00:29:45,038
[SPEAKER_17]: And we can come back to Dennis.

341
00:29:54,523 --> 00:29:58,844
[SPEAKER_18]: Ask him to turn his volume up if it's not already up.

342
00:30:00,204 --> 00:30:01,424
[SPEAKER_18]: I see the question came through.

343
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:03,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Did a question come through?

344
00:30:03,405 --> 00:30:04,605
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, let's see.

345
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:09,106
[SPEAKER_10]: I can address it if... Sure.

346
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:14,747
[SPEAKER_10]: So the question is, so this item will be deferred until April 1st question.

347
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:17,948
[SPEAKER_10]: So the deadline for fiscal year 2020 was

348
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:26,427
[SPEAKER_10]: April 1st of this year, and we would have had to set the rate actually by the end of the previous fiscal year.

349
00:30:26,528 --> 00:30:34,574
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have to, this rate has to be decided by the end of this fiscal year in order for it to be enacted for fiscal year 2021.

350
00:30:35,254 --> 00:30:39,258
[SPEAKER_10]: And the deadline to apply for that is April 1st of 2021.

351
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:39,518
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

352
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:45,663
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I saw an okay.

353
00:30:45,763 --> 00:30:47,624
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking the same thing.

354
00:30:49,483 --> 00:30:54,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, then if there are no other questions, Clerk Harnabees, do you have any questions that came through email?

355
00:30:55,747 --> 00:30:57,048
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm checking, but I don't believe so.

356
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:01,251
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have any, correct.

357
00:31:01,271 --> 00:31:02,552
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Clerk Harnabees.

358
00:31:03,072 --> 00:31:06,455
[SPEAKER_17]: So what we'll do is we'll vote on the B paper first.

359
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:08,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Clerk Harnabees, could you please read back?

360
00:31:10,277 --> 00:31:11,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, quick question.

361
00:31:11,878 --> 00:31:14,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Is Council Marks' amendment a C paper or is it part of the B paper?

362
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:16,681
[SPEAKER_16]: Or is it an amendment to the main paper?

363
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,444
[SPEAKER_17]: If that's all right with Councilor Morell.

364
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:22,285
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep, yes.

365
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:25,706
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll make that part of the B paper.

366

[SPEAKER_17]: So on the B paper offered by Councilor Morell, seconded by Councilor Marks.

[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

402
00:32:35,358 --> 00:32:39,242
[SPEAKER_17]: 2-0-288, offered by Councilor Morell and Councilor Bears.

403
00:32:40,437 --> 00:32:59,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Whereas Massachusetts House Bill 4440 seeks to allow all independent public retirement systems subject to oversight by the Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission, PRAC, to divest their holdings in full or in part from the fossil fuel industry.

404
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:08,420
[SPEAKER_17]: And whereas H4440 authorizes independent public retirement systems to exercise their fiduciary duty

405
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:19,056
[SPEAKER_17]: as defined in Mass General Law chapter 32, section 23, 3, with respect to continued investment in the fossil fuel industry.

406
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:28,406
[SPEAKER_17]: And whereas such authorization is required by PRAC, PRAC communications to the Cambridge Retirement Board, CRB, dated October 23, 2017,

407
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:35,720
[SPEAKER_17]: and to the Salvador Retirement Board, SRB, dated November 7, 2017.

408
00:33:38,004 --> 00:33:44,974
[SPEAKER_17]: And whereas communities throughout Massachusetts, including Amherst, Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Concord,

409
00:33:45,321 --> 00:34:05,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Falmouth, Framingham, Great Barrington, Lexington, Lowell, Newton, Northampton, Provincetown, Somerville, Sudbury, and Truro have passed resolutions in support of fossil fuel divestment and be it resolved that the Medford City Council express its support for House Bill 4440 and urge the Massachusetts Legislature

410
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:16,832
[SPEAKER_17]: to take action to pass this measure to enable independent public retirement systems to use their prudent judgment in regards to fossil fuel divestment and

411
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:33,321
[SPEAKER_17]: We have further resolved that the city clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Medford legislative delegation, as well as the chairs and vice chairs of all committees to which H4440 is or will be assigned.

412
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:38,405
[SPEAKER_17]: House Speaker DeLeo, Senate President Spilka, and Governor Baker.

413
00:34:40,726 --> 00:34:44,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Morell, would you like to speak of it?

414
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

415
00:34:47,748 --> 00:35:02,075
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to note and really reiterate that House Bill 440 urges the Massachusetts legislature to take action to pass a measure to enable independent public retirement systems to use their prudent judgment in regards to fossil fuel divestment.

416
00:35:02,655 --> 00:35:16,802
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's important to note that this body's support of the bill does not codify any action by the city, but it simply expresses our support of a bill that would allow us to divest from fossil fuels at some time in the future, should we choose to do so.

417
00:35:17,276 --> 00:35:27,842
[SPEAKER_10]: So I bring this forth, Councilor Bears and I bring this forth at the behest of many citizens that have reached out in the city of Medford, and a number of which are actually in the retirement system in the city.

418
00:35:29,142 --> 00:35:40,869
[SPEAKER_10]: By de facto investing our retirement funds in fossil fuels, we tacitly support emissions that contribute to climate change and all the damage associated with it, including air pollution and any issues and ailments caused by it.

419
00:35:41,049 --> 00:35:43,050
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's, we as a city,

420
00:35:43,604 --> 00:35:52,869
[SPEAKER_10]: It's very hard for us to work towards climate change adaptation and mitigation in one office while we invest in the very industry that's caused the need for such things in another.

421
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:58,072
[SPEAKER_10]: So the current crisis also highlights just how vulnerable and sensitive our systems are.

422
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:04,075
[SPEAKER_10]: And we can't continue to invest in a system that damages the very planet we live on and exacerbates all natural crises.

423
00:36:05,116 --> 00:36:07,637
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's kind of my stump for that.

424
00:36:09,098 --> 00:36:10,278
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

425
00:36:10,299 --> 00:36:10,979
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears.

426
00:36:12,118 --> 00:36:13,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

427
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:15,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think everything Councilor Morales said is spot on.

428
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,622
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to add a couple of things.

429
00:36:17,782 --> 00:36:26,128
[SPEAKER_02]: One, which is that the folks who have been leading this fight, many of them are public employees themselves, the people whose retirement funds we're talking about here.

430
00:36:26,729 --> 00:36:32,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I know many of the large major public employee unions in the state support this bill.

431
00:36:32,553 --> 00:36:37,937
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a letter from the political director of Service Employees International Union, SEIU Local 509 today.

432
00:36:37,957 --> 00:36:37,997
[SPEAKER_02]: So

433
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:47,714
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think workers want to see their retirement invested prudently, and I think there's no actually better evidence of that.

434
00:36:47,754 --> 00:37:06,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this would have been good at any time, but what we've seen with the market over the past few weeks, and also combine that with a massive oil price war that has deeply dropped the price of oil and devalued stocks, this would not be the time for retirement funds to be buying into the fossil fuel industry anyway.

435
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:09,445
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we've seen a great evidence of the volatility.

436
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:21,270
[SPEAKER_02]: that's happening now and that's only going to get worse as our global energy system is disrupted by the fact that we can't use fossil fuels for much longer if we want to keep the planet healthy.

437
00:37:23,191 --> 00:37:24,192
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

438
00:37:24,232 --> 00:37:26,633
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight and then Councilor Caraviello.

439
00:37:26,673 --> 00:37:28,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

440
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

441
00:37:29,974 --> 00:37:32,115
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a good bill, House 4440.

442
00:37:32,496 --> 00:37:35,157
[SPEAKER_06]: It allows us to put our money where our mouth is, Mr. President.

443
00:37:35,177 --> 00:37:35,457
[SPEAKER_06]: We all

444
00:37:36,164 --> 00:37:44,946
[SPEAKER_06]: talk a good game when it comes down to protecting the environment, but this allows us to invest our money in areas like green energy and clean energy as opposed to with fossil fuels.

445
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:46,086
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this is a good measure.

446
00:37:47,147 --> 00:37:54,688
[SPEAKER_06]: It allows flexibility for us to exercise our community's values when it comes to the moral and ethical obligation to greenhouse gas pollution.

447
00:37:54,708 --> 00:37:59,190
[SPEAKER_06]: So I commend my fellow colleagues for bringing this issue forward and it's something that I support wholeheartedly.

448
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

449
00:38:01,585 --> 00:38:02,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Caraviello.

450
00:38:04,089 --> 00:38:04,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

451
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:06,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

452
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:14,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a problem with this bill because these people that run these retirement, they're independent and autonomous bodies.

453
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:19,615
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel that it's not up to us to be telling these people what to do.

454
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:27,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel that this is something that we should be, that people should be calling the state delegation about and not venting through us.

455
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:36,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I say these people are independent and autonomous, and let's say not that it's not the right thing to do, and you're asking them,

456
00:38:36,812 --> 00:39:03,060
[SPEAKER_04]: To use their prudent judgments in regards, uh, these people that that have their i'll assume are using uh prudent judgments Uh, and unless unless someone shows me difference So I say at this point, I uh, I I don't know that if this is a matter for us, but it should be a matter for uh, people should be voicing to the the state delegation and not the medford city council

457
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:06,932
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you Councilor Caraviello.

458
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:10,453
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other councilors like to speak on this?

459
00:39:10,793 --> 00:39:11,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Marks.

460
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:13,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

461
00:39:13,834 --> 00:39:15,294
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just posing a question.

462
00:39:15,774 --> 00:39:22,775
[SPEAKER_13]: What would prevent any retirement board currently from doing any different type of divestment they'd like to do?

463
00:39:26,236 --> 00:39:27,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Perak.

464
00:39:29,097 --> 00:39:30,157
[SPEAKER_10]: As I understand Perak,

465
00:39:30,812 --> 00:39:51,025
[SPEAKER_10]: In a previous decision brought forth from the Somerville City Council, and I know there are actually people on this call who are very well versed in that, they advised against it, but they actually, at a later date, they went back on that decision, I believe, or just decided that it was actually not the best advisement as far as ways to invest.

466
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:55,327
[SPEAKER_10]: So because that independent board had advised against it,

467
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:59,296
[SPEAKER_10]: they were, the Somerville City Council was unable to pass their measure.

468
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:04,939
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why this has come up in this form, because I see Councilor Scarpelli has his hand raised.

469
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,042
[SPEAKER_10]: If people can offer, yeah, I mean, that's my poor retelling of it, so.

470
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:32,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, just if I could, I had the opportunity to talk to one of our local board members, and he said at this current point, if the board decided to divest in any different option that they chose, they would go to their advisor and choose to do so, and nothing would prohibit them from doing so.

471
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless there was a conflict of interest of a board member,

472
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:42,359
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is a whole other ballgame.

473
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,683
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not bringing that in, but that's a whole other ballgame.

474
00:40:45,164 --> 00:40:47,427
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not sure quite what House 4440 does in

475
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:58,415
[SPEAKER_13]: moving this issue forward, if we're really talking about, you know, investing in our planet and so forth.

476
00:40:59,096 --> 00:41:02,379
[SPEAKER_13]: I think currently, these boards have the ability to do so.

477
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:04,501
[SPEAKER_13]: And they can exercise that right.

478
00:41:05,401 --> 00:41:07,283
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not quite sure what this does.

479
00:41:07,603 --> 00:41:11,687
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's just a feel good type initiative, then so be it.

480
00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:15,810
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm not sure what weight this really holds, to be quite honest with you.

481
00:41:16,812 --> 00:41:17,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

482
00:41:17,793 --> 00:41:24,576
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a number of people that want to ask questions and speak, so we will get to everybody, but just going to call out some of the councilors first.

483
00:41:24,936 --> 00:41:26,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Morell, I believe you wanted to comment on that.

484
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:28,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you, Mr. President.

485
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:43,426
[SPEAKER_10]: So this isn't just like a feel good kind of, so Bill, I mean, it does feel good, but the boards do need specific legislative authority because the way it is designed, and I do know that there are people on the call that can speak to this,

486
00:41:44,551 --> 00:41:48,614
[SPEAKER_10]: but it's not just that there is specific authority that is needed.

487
00:41:52,075 --> 00:41:52,456
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

488
00:41:52,736 --> 00:41:54,737
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Morell, I believe.

489
00:41:55,277 --> 00:42:13,027
[SPEAKER_13]: So Mr. President, if I could, cause I feel that a number of emails and phone calls and in my conversations and back and forth with residents, I asked each resident if they were a member of the retirement board and quite to my amazement,

490
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:21,173
[SPEAKER_13]: Not one retiree or member of the current retirement board reached out to me to express their opinion on this.

491
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:29,376
[SPEAKER_13]: It happened to be everyone outside of the retirement system and everyone's open to their own opinion, which is great.

492
00:42:29,796 --> 00:42:37,458
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think we have to remember this is $182 million worth of assets for our retirees in this community.

493
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:42,020
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have to be very mindful that any change

494
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:46,957
[SPEAKER_13]: could have a potential impact on the investments that are being made.

495
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:52,001
[SPEAKER_13]: And the future of many retirees in this community.

496
00:42:52,582 --> 00:42:54,924
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we have to be very mindful of that.

497
00:42:56,065 --> 00:42:58,066
[SPEAKER_13]: At least I am before I take any action.

498
00:42:58,547 --> 00:42:59,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information.

499
00:42:59,447 --> 00:43:01,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilmember Mox.

500
00:43:01,389 --> 00:43:02,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Councilmember Morell.

501
00:43:03,411 --> 00:43:07,975
[SPEAKER_10]: So this won't codify any decision by our public, our retirement system.

502
00:43:08,015 --> 00:43:10,477
[SPEAKER_10]: This will just say we have, it will give

503
00:43:11,016 --> 00:43:17,462
[SPEAKER_10]: bodies like the public retirement system in Medford, it will give them the option to make this decision.

504
00:43:17,502 --> 00:43:19,504
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't divest.

505
00:43:19,544 --> 00:43:20,345
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't do anything.

506
00:43:20,385 --> 00:43:24,449
[SPEAKER_10]: It just gives the option to make that decision at a future date, should they choose to.

507
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:25,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

508
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:30,835
[SPEAKER_13]: And specifically, the language states fossil fuels.

509
00:43:31,562 --> 00:43:35,104
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're making it sound like, oh, they can go off and do whatever they want.

510
00:43:35,144 --> 00:43:48,433
[SPEAKER_13]: But the legislation specifically says fossil fuels and to divest from fossil fuels, which is Exxon, Chevron, British Petroleum, a lot of the major S&P.

511
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:51,381
[SPEAKER_13]: bear holders.

512
00:43:52,022 --> 00:43:56,243
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we have to be very careful because this will have an impact.

513
00:43:56,883 --> 00:44:08,208
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if anyone could state what type of impact, but if we do move away from a certain energy, it will have an impact on retirees within this community.

514
00:44:08,948 --> 00:44:10,969
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we have to be very mindful of that.

515
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:13,850
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

516
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:14,791
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears.

517
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:16,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

518
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:17,672
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think,

519
00:44:18,882 --> 00:44:22,103
[SPEAKER_02]: There are definitely people on this call as well who can speak more to this than I can.

520
00:44:23,123 --> 00:44:38,946
[SPEAKER_02]: But what the bill does is essentially there's different categories that to my understanding and other people can describe it better of what different things you can factor into investment decisions.

521
00:44:39,006 --> 00:44:43,827
[SPEAKER_02]: This would authorize the retirement board to consider this as a factor in decisions that they make.

522
00:44:43,867 --> 00:44:44,727
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not saying

523
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:47,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now they're not authorized to do that.

524
00:44:47,954 --> 00:45:10,909
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like specifically what you said They're not authorized to say we don't want to invest in fossil fuel companies This would allow them to make that decision if they wanted to And it's just allowing the ledge asking the legislature to pass a bill to grant that authority to municipal retirement boards So we wouldn't be making this decision It would just say that the retirement board could make the decision in the future if they wanted to or any Any of those boards across the state?

525
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:12,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you

526
00:45:13,112 --> 00:45:17,535
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Bears, Councilor Knight, and then Councilor Scarpelli.

527
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:33,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Mr. President, I think it's very important to point out that this is nothing more than giving our retirement board flexibility and an option to make a determination as to whether or not we want to divest from fossil fuels in the investment of our public pension funds.

528
00:45:34,886 --> 00:45:38,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Because our public pension investment bodies are

529
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:50,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, autonomous in nature, legislative action will be necessary because the retirement board is telling them they need to get a return of a certain amount, whether it's 7% forecast, 6% forecast.

530
00:45:50,478 --> 00:45:53,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we're not getting that return.

531
00:45:53,401 --> 00:45:56,503
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't tell them what to invest in and then expect them to make a return.

532
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:58,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why this legislative authority is necessary.

533
00:46:00,246 --> 00:46:01,087
[SPEAKER_06]: This does nothing.

534
00:46:01,107 --> 00:46:02,908
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't mandate that we divest.

535
00:46:02,948 --> 00:46:05,190
[SPEAKER_06]: What it does is it gives us the opportunity to pursue it.

536
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and if our community has values that, uh,

537
00:46:09,065 --> 00:46:17,532
[SPEAKER_06]: reflect this lack of reliance on fossil fuels and a move towards green energy, a move towards being carbon neutral.

538
00:46:17,772 --> 00:46:20,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is a tool that we want inside our toolbox.

539
00:46:21,595 --> 00:46:31,503
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think it's going to hurt us any just to support the legislation, Mr. President, because it's still going to allow our retirement board to make the decisions that they made them in the past, but it's going to give them a little bit more flexibility.

540
00:46:31,843 --> 00:46:33,705
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's something I'd be willing to support.

541
00:46:34,946 --> 00:46:35,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

542
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:36,567
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpell.

543
00:46:38,078 --> 00:46:38,959
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Council President.

544
00:46:38,999 --> 00:46:55,217
[SPEAKER_15]: I just, I thank Councilor Morell for bringing that up and the fact that I am a member of the Somerville Retirement System, PARAC, and so that you've all answered it to the specifications that I as an employee for the City of Somerville

545
00:46:56,498 --> 00:46:57,239
[SPEAKER_15]: understand that.

546
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:10,410
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that it doesn't preclude anything yet, but what it does is it puts us in a position as a community to put our money where our mouth is, and that's what everybody's saying.

547
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:16,935
[SPEAKER_15]: But it doesn't actually, right now, there isn't anything that's prohibiting them from doing that.

548
00:47:17,015 --> 00:47:21,218
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is just moving the paper forward to show the support.

549
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:23,280
[SPEAKER_15]: So I support this.

550
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:24,001
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a

551
00:47:24,881 --> 00:47:32,147
[SPEAKER_15]: a great idea and it, you know, and it causes some more concern as you see what's going on right now in our environment.

552
00:47:32,187 --> 00:47:34,069
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you, Mr. President.

553
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

554
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:40,114
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other councilors, are there any other councilors that would like to speak on this?

555
00:47:40,674 --> 00:47:41,375
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President.

556
00:47:42,135 --> 00:47:42,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Marks.

557
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:58,563
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a very appropriate term, putting your money where your mouth is, because in fiscal 20 of last year, the taxpayers in this community invested $12.2 million into the retirement system to make that system whole.

558
00:47:59,123 --> 00:48:04,408
[SPEAKER_13]: And every year over the last 20-something years, Mr. President, the taxpayers have been supplementing

559
00:48:04,852 --> 00:48:06,634
[SPEAKER_13]: the retirement system to make it whole.

560
00:48:07,374 --> 00:48:15,362
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, I'm not saying this is going to happen, but eventually when you do open the door, uh, you will be putting your money where your mouth is.

561
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:21,728
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and the taxpayers will be paying the burden of that, Mr. President, as well as the retirees.

562
00:48:22,228 --> 00:48:24,250
[SPEAKER_13]: So this doesn't just impact retirees.

563
00:48:24,691 --> 00:48:28,514
[SPEAKER_13]: It impacts every taxpayer in this community down the road.

564
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:40,058
[SPEAKER_13]: potentially could be paying additional money depending on what investments made, what diversity is done in regards to investments and so forth.

565
00:48:40,799 --> 00:48:43,140
[SPEAKER_13]: And this could have a major impact, Mr. President.

566
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:49,685
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, the proponents of this would like you to believe that this is just another tool in the toolbox.

567
00:48:50,146 --> 00:48:58,033
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the opening of the door, Mr. President, to now go and put pressure on our local boards, because that's the next step.

568
00:48:58,373 --> 00:49:03,938
[SPEAKER_13]: The next step is to go put pressure on the local board members to start making the changes, Mr. President.

569
00:49:04,393 --> 00:49:05,013
[SPEAKER_13]: And so be it.

570
00:49:05,634 --> 00:49:09,775
[SPEAKER_13]: And I applaud anyone that's working towards a cause, Mr. President.

571
00:49:09,795 --> 00:49:12,616
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm mindful of the taxpayers of this community.

572
00:49:12,997 --> 00:49:15,177
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm mindful of keeping a strong system.

573
00:49:15,898 --> 00:49:21,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Our last five years, the return was 6.25 in our portfolio.

574
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,580
[SPEAKER_13]: The last three years was 8%.

575
00:49:24,001 --> 00:49:30,023
[SPEAKER_13]: And this year, before the issue that we're in, it was at 10.9%.

576
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:33,978
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's down very much from that.

577
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:48,681
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just want to state, Mr. President, based on what our portfolio has been over the last five years, any change could have a devastating impact, Mr. President, to the returns and to our retirees and to our taxpayers.

578
00:49:50,361 --> 00:49:51,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

579
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:53,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other councilors like to speak?

580
00:49:54,002 --> 00:49:56,862
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

581
00:49:57,423 --> 00:50:00,083
[SPEAKER_17]: At this point, I recognize Colby Cunningham.

582
00:50:05,073 --> 00:50:06,314
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

583
00:50:07,315 --> 00:50:12,178
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Colby Cunningham, and my address is 259 Highland Avenue, Arlington, Massachusetts.

584
00:50:12,498 --> 00:50:14,280
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am the president of MassDivest.

585
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:26,048
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to speak mainly to the first issue that was raised as to whether or not independent retirement systems are currently allowed to divest from any particular sector.

586
00:50:26,669 --> 00:50:30,251
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the root of this bill that's under consideration.

587
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:42,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Somerville attempted to divest its pension system in part, a small trial balloon of its funds from the fossil fuel industry back in 2017.

588
00:50:44,966 --> 00:51:00,295
[SPEAKER_09]: At that time, PARAC, which serves as the state regulator of all independent retirement systems, including both Somerville, Medford's, Boston's, et cetera, sent a letter to the Somerville Retirement Board stating very explicitly that

589
00:51:01,235 --> 00:51:16,921
[SPEAKER_09]: the wholesale divestment from any particular sector, whether it be energy or utilities or any sector of the S&P, would be a violation of fiduciary duty if that was done without explicit permission from the legislature.

590
00:51:18,837 --> 00:51:27,661
[SPEAKER_09]: And so at that time, because they were told that they did not have the authority to do that without a legislative intervention, Somerville unwound its divestment.

591
00:51:27,681 --> 00:51:31,403
[SPEAKER_09]: So they were divested in part for about a month.

592
00:51:32,243 --> 00:51:35,024
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they unwound that because PARAC made this ruling.

593
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,626
[SPEAKER_09]: PARAC also sent a similar notice, as the resolution states, to Cambridge.

594
00:51:39,026 --> 00:51:47,050
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's two cities in Massachusetts that were told explicitly by their regulator that they were not allowed to divest from fossil fuels or any other sector

595
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:51,154
[SPEAKER_09]: without the legislature providing explicit authorization to do so.

596
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:56,099
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is, in fact, explicitly necessary per their regulator.

597
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:02,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to address Councilor Marks' concerns regarding the finance element of it.

598
00:52:02,566 --> 00:52:08,752
[SPEAKER_09]: One of my colleagues is also on this call, Jamie, and he will

599
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:15,727
[SPEAKER_09]: He'll speak to the study that we did regarding the performance of Somerville's divested portfolio.

600
00:52:16,308 --> 00:52:25,678
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do want to point out that the energy sector, which is dominated by the fossil fuel industry, was the worst performing sector in the entire past decade.

601
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:28,581
[SPEAKER_09]: So when it comes to concerns regarding

602
00:52:29,822 --> 00:52:36,706
[SPEAKER_09]: the impact on pensioners and taxpayers in Medford, the impact of the fossil fuel industry is extremely negative.

603
00:52:37,386 --> 00:52:50,653
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the concerns that Councilor Marks raises I think are incredibly valid and really important, but they are oriented in the other way, because the fossil fuel industry is a huge drag on all pension systems and the S&P 500 in whole.

604
00:52:54,197 --> 00:53:00,162
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's those costs that are part of, to taxpayers, that are part of why we advocate for this legislation.

605
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:02,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

606
00:53:05,527 --> 00:53:06,107
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie Hall.

607
00:53:06,868 --> 00:53:08,109
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

608
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:15,615
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Jamie Hall, and my address is 233 Cedar Street in Somerville, Massachusetts.

609
00:53:15,655 --> 00:53:17,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, and thank you, city councilors.

610
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:29,110
[SPEAKER_20]: As Colby mentioned, the remarks that I've prepared I think can help answer a question that was raised by Councilor Marks regarding the impacts of, financial impacts of divestment from fossil fuel companies.

611
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:35,352
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm here in support of Resolution 20-288, which would support H4440.

612
00:53:36,252 --> 00:53:45,314
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a consultant at an economic consulting firm specializing in energy economics, but I'm speaking now as a citizen who's concerned about the climate crisis and a member of MassDivest.

613
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:52,702
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm also the author of a 2019 white paper that I developed for MassDivest, and it serves as a good divestment case study.

614
00:53:53,403 --> 00:54:08,348
[SPEAKER_20]: As Colby Cunningham mentioned earlier, in June 2017, the Somerville Retirement Board voted to divest 9.5 million of its assets from a portfolio that includes fossil fuels, and instead reinvest them in a fossil-free index fund.

615
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:13,330
[SPEAKER_20]: But in July 2017, PARAC intervened and Somerville's

616
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,542
[SPEAKER_20]: was required to reverse its divestment decision.

617
00:54:17,703 --> 00:54:28,310
[SPEAKER_20]: The analysis that we conducted explores the returns of Somerville's divested portfolio alongside the S&P 500 index fund over a two-year period from July 2017 to June 2019.

618
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:39,537
[SPEAKER_20]: And it shows that the divested portfolio would have achieved 5% higher growth than it did by remaining invested in the S&P 500 fund.

619
00:54:39,918 --> 00:54:41,839
[SPEAKER_20]: That includes fossil fuel companies.

620
00:54:43,062 --> 00:54:51,665
[SPEAKER_20]: According to the 2018 PARAC annual report, the Medford Retirement Board has over 40 million of its assets tied in with the S&P 500.

621
00:54:52,045 --> 00:55:02,289
[SPEAKER_20]: And so our findings that a divested portfolio would have achieved 5% higher growth over that two-year time period than the S&P 500 also applies to those $40 million in assets.

622
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:20,538
[SPEAKER_20]: We're working on an update to that white paper that extends it through March of this year, and the preliminary results show that the divested portfolio performed 6.4% better than the S&P 500 from July 2017 through to March 2020.

623
00:55:23,018 --> 00:55:32,760
[SPEAKER_20]: Because of this and because of the urgency of the climate crisis, I ask that the Medford City Council please pass Resolution 2288 in support of House Bill 4440.

624
00:55:34,912 --> 00:55:35,252
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

625
00:55:35,713 --> 00:55:36,013
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

626
00:55:43,461 --> 00:55:43,821
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

627
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:46,922
[SPEAKER_22]: City Councilors my name is Craig Slayton.

628
00:55:48,002 --> 00:55:50,262
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a resident of Medford living on Dover Street.

629
00:55:50,802 --> 00:55:53,983
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a retiree in the state pension system.

630
00:55:56,764 --> 00:56:08,646
[SPEAKER_22]: In addition to my pension funds I have some other retirement investments and I was just speaking with my financial advisor, couple of weeks, two weeks ago, as we watch the market tank.

631
00:56:10,087 --> 00:56:17,038
[SPEAKER_22]: And he said, boy, it's a really good thing that you convinced me to get you out of fossil fuels because they really took a hit.

632
00:56:21,805 --> 00:56:23,007
[SPEAKER_22]: If Medford

633
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:35,594
[SPEAKER_22]: wants to take responsibility for keeping fossil fuels in its retirement pension funds and screw the retirees of the city.

634
00:56:36,754 --> 00:56:38,676
[SPEAKER_22]: Shame on Medford, but it has the right to do it.

635
00:56:38,736 --> 00:56:45,801
[SPEAKER_22]: But this bill, this resolution would make it possible for any other municipalities, in addition to Medford,

636
00:56:46,341 --> 00:56:52,646
[SPEAKER_22]: that want to do right by the retirees to take the actions.

637
00:56:54,288 --> 00:56:57,710
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a member of the Massachusetts Teachers Association for several years.

638
00:56:58,651 --> 00:57:05,417
[SPEAKER_22]: We work to get the delegates to the annual meeting of the MTA, which is the largest union in the state of 110,000 members.

639
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:25,124
[SPEAKER_22]: to call on the legislature to support legislation and the legislature to have the Pension Reserves Investment Management Board, which manages the state pensions, to divest from fossil fuel holdings.

640
00:57:25,164 --> 00:57:26,824
[SPEAKER_22]: At that point, it was coal.

641
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:38,478
[SPEAKER_22]: The same kinds of arguments that Councilor Marx is raising were raised by our representatives to the PRIM for several years.

642
00:57:38,578 --> 00:57:53,011
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the third time that we moved this measure, we finally got the members of the delegates to the annual meeting to understand the dire consequences of staying with fossil fuels.

643
00:57:54,032 --> 00:57:57,814
[SPEAKER_22]: and they voted to support legislation to do this.

644
00:58:00,497 --> 00:58:19,251
[SPEAKER_22]: The fossil fuel industry, in addition to being largely responsible for the climate crisis that we face, which is going to bring tremendous cost to the city of Medford as it tries to cope with the consequences of this devastation,

645
00:58:22,352 --> 00:58:29,241
[SPEAKER_22]: In addition to that, though, the fossil fuel industry also is one of the greatest polluters of this area.

646
00:58:29,921 --> 00:58:32,545
[SPEAKER_22]: And in fact, Attorney General Healey

647
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:46,035
[SPEAKER_22]: has sued Exxon Mobil because of their facilities in Chelsea, which are polluting the Mystic River, the very river that flows into Medford, and we have to deal with that pollution.

648
00:58:46,556 --> 00:58:57,118
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think on lots of grounds, it makes a lot of sense for this city council to endorse this resolution and call upon the legislature to pass this.

649
00:58:58,058 --> 00:58:58,338
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

650
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:13,004
[SPEAKER_18]: John, are you there?

651
00:59:17,046 --> 00:59:18,667
[SPEAKER_18]: Nope.

652
00:59:20,868 --> 00:59:21,188
[SPEAKER_18]: Dennis?

653
00:59:23,909 --> 00:59:24,790
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm having problems.

654
00:59:29,712 --> 00:59:30,012
[SPEAKER_18]: Dennis?

655
00:59:32,634 --> 00:59:33,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you hear me?

656
00:59:33,994 --> 00:59:34,134
No.

657
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:35,575
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't.

658
00:59:36,776 --> 00:59:37,676
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really faint.

659
00:59:37,776 --> 00:59:39,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe just- Very faint, yeah.

660
00:59:39,717 --> 00:59:41,858
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear you a little bit.

661
00:59:43,067 --> 00:59:43,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

662
00:59:43,327 --> 00:59:43,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

663
00:59:43,808 --> 00:59:44,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

664
00:59:44,128 --> 00:59:44,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk right into it.

665
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:46,531
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to speak up.

666
00:59:47,152 --> 00:59:48,954
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, the mic's not working very well.

667
00:59:49,955 --> 00:59:53,219
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely in favor of this bill.

668
00:59:53,339 --> 01:00:00,568
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I've spoken to retirement boards and emailed them and so on, called people.

669
01:00:01,452 --> 01:00:04,214
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all say, well, it's not our decision.

670
01:00:04,414 --> 01:00:06,596
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a requirement by the state.

671
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:13,102
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that board that people talked about that says that they can't make those decisions.

672
01:00:13,182 --> 01:00:15,864
[SPEAKER_00]: The municipalities can't make those decisions right now.

673
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:28,875
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the bill asks for, again, is that the cities and towns be able to make those kind of decisions on their own about where they want to make investments.

674
01:00:29,745 --> 01:00:36,007
[SPEAKER_00]: The other point I want to make is that right now oil and so on is down.

675
01:00:36,707 --> 01:00:38,647
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean it won't go up later.

676
01:00:38,807 --> 01:00:45,129
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not advocating that if it goes up, the town should be allowed to invest in it.

677
01:00:45,389 --> 01:00:47,649
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they should be allowed to invest in it.

678
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:51,090
[SPEAKER_00]: The bill would not prevent them from doing that.

679
01:00:52,751 --> 01:00:54,891
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not in favor of that.

680
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,492
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point of this bill right now

681
01:00:58,579 --> 01:01:12,308
[SPEAKER_00]: is not just to save money for retirees, which is a great thing to do, but also to help mitigate the consequences of climate change, which is happening.

682
01:01:12,408 --> 01:01:13,709
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the weather problems.

683
01:01:14,089 --> 01:01:15,710
[SPEAKER_00]: There are gonna be storms this fall.

684
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:16,931
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have to say right now.

685
01:01:18,392 --> 01:01:18,712
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

686
01:01:19,312 --> 01:01:19,733
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

687
01:01:21,974 --> 01:01:22,815
[SPEAKER_18]: Any other questions?

688
01:01:30,575 --> 01:01:31,956
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I think I got everybody.

689
01:01:32,016 --> 01:01:32,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's see.

690
01:01:33,616 --> 01:01:33,716
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh.

691
01:01:34,697 --> 01:01:35,557
[SPEAKER_17]: See Curtis Tudin.

692
01:01:36,738 --> 01:01:41,560
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, so we have a Curtis, Curtis Tudin.

693
01:01:43,361 --> 01:01:44,321
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, good evening everyone.

694
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:45,282
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Curtis Tudin.

695
01:01:45,322 --> 01:01:47,162
[SPEAKER_24]: I live at 38 Early Ave in Medford.

696
01:01:47,763 --> 01:01:54,065
[SPEAKER_24]: And first I'd like to thank the council and the clerk's office for continuing to work in this time of crisis and making the meeting available online.

697
01:01:54,886 --> 01:01:59,788
[SPEAKER_24]: Second, I want to send my warmest regards to fellow residents who are trying to pull through this historically trying time.

698
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:05,300
[SPEAKER_24]: The disease will end someday and that's why my focus tonight is on a healthy future for our environment.

699
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:13,989
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been a city employee for the last 10 years and long from now when I'm able to retire, I want to know my money wasn't made at the expense of our natural world and future generations.

700
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:19,974
[SPEAKER_24]: The current situation where part of my paycheck is used to finance a failing and deadly industry cannot continue.

701
01:02:20,755 --> 01:02:22,777
[SPEAKER_24]: Though the final decision falls on our state reps,

702
01:02:23,152 --> 01:02:30,814
[SPEAKER_24]: Medford City Council voting in support tonight would send a clear message that the failure to act responsibly by confronting climate change will not be tolerated.

703
01:02:31,494 --> 01:02:34,295
[SPEAKER_24]: We have about 10 years to completely divest from fossil fuels.

704
01:02:34,775 --> 01:02:36,516
[SPEAKER_24]: So let's take this small step forward together.

705
01:02:37,116 --> 01:02:44,778
[SPEAKER_24]: And thanks to everyone who shows their support and solidarity with the environment this evening, and good luck to us all in the coming days and decades of crisis management.

706
01:02:45,038 --> 01:02:45,339
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

707
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

708
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Colby Cunningham, did you have?

709
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:54,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

710
01:02:54,970 --> 01:03:21,347
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, just one thing I I failed to mention in my original comments that I I added in the chat But I wanted to make sure the council was aware of uh, is that exxon mobil is currently being sued by uh attorney general healy, uh for not just the the pollution issues that were raised earlier, but in a separate lawsuit Uh is being charged with violations of the massachusetts consumer protection statute and those charges include deceiving institutional investors like

711
01:03:21,927 --> 01:03:30,577
[SPEAKER_09]: The medford retirement system and all the other retirement systems in massachusetts about the impact that climate change was going to have On exxon mobil's own business model.

712
01:03:31,178 --> 01:03:36,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, so we have a situation where the state of massachusetts is aware or is concerned or

713
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:44,365
[SPEAKER_09]: is concerned that institutional investors are being misled by a major actor in the fossil fuel industry and the energy sector generally.

714
01:03:45,265 --> 01:04:01,235
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it would really behoove the Medford retirement system, all the independent retirement systems, to have the opportunity to make their own decisions as to whether or not they would want to continue to be invested in an industry that is known to the state of Massachusetts to be lying to them about their own business model.

715
01:04:02,643 --> 01:04:08,345
[SPEAKER_09]: And I included a link to the Attorney General's press release about that lawsuit in the comments.

716
01:04:09,826 --> 01:04:10,086
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

717
01:04:10,406 --> 01:04:11,227
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

718
01:04:16,249 --> 01:04:18,230
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that was it as far as questions go.

719
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:21,591
[SPEAKER_17]: Clark, any emails that have recently arrived?

720
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:24,832
[SPEAKER_16]: There have been none during the meeting.

721
01:04:24,852 --> 01:04:27,614
[SPEAKER_16]: Anything that arrived before the meeting, I forwarded to you already.

722
01:04:28,074 --> 01:04:29,214

01:11:41,483 --> 01:11:42,304
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm from Bangladesh.

845
01:11:43,582 --> 01:11:47,146
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, my background, I had restaurant before in Portland, Maine.

846
01:11:47,206 --> 01:11:50,730
[SPEAKER_19]: I did very good on last 15 years.

847
01:11:52,071 --> 01:11:54,113
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm moving to the mass now.

848
01:11:55,034 --> 01:12:02,362
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm trying to open the... Actually, this is going to be my chain restaurant, franchise.

849
01:12:03,148 --> 01:12:05,210
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is my first location.

850
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:06,391
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is my logo.

851
01:12:07,712 --> 01:12:11,115
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, I'm preparing one also in New York, in Brooklyn.

852
01:12:11,495 --> 01:12:17,080
[SPEAKER_19]: So very soon it's going to be open over there too, I think, on Charles McDonald's.

853
01:12:18,621 --> 01:12:19,882
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, and the type of food?

854
01:12:21,123 --> 01:12:30,992
[SPEAKER_19]: It's Indian and also grilled chicken, grilled charcoal chicken, fried chicken, and Indian food also.

855
01:12:31,773 --> 01:12:32,393
[SPEAKER_15]: We're good, okay.

856
01:12:32,413 --> 01:12:38,878
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that we just recently lost the only Indian restaurant and it was a big loss to our community.

857
01:12:38,918 --> 01:12:42,260
[SPEAKER_15]: So how many people will be working in that location?

858
01:12:43,361 --> 01:12:46,283
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually for three, it's takeout only.

859
01:12:46,643 --> 01:12:48,064
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's not seating.

860
01:12:48,264 --> 01:12:48,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

861
01:12:48,945 --> 01:12:49,845
[SPEAKER_19]: Only for takeouts.

862
01:12:50,806 --> 01:12:51,106
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

863
01:12:51,646 --> 01:12:53,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

864
01:12:53,368 --> 01:12:55,249
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it for me, Mr. President.

865
01:12:55,629 --> 01:12:56,310
[SPEAKER_15]: I move approval.

866
01:12:56,550 --> 01:12:58,231
[SPEAKER_15]: I know my colleague says some questions.

867
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:01,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

868
01:13:01,136 --> 01:13:03,817
[SPEAKER_17]: In the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, Vice President Caraviello.

869
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:05,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

870
01:13:06,358 --> 01:13:07,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one question.

871
01:13:07,698 --> 01:13:09,979
[SPEAKER_04]: What is currently in 49 High Street now?

872
01:13:09,999 --> 01:13:12,160
[SPEAKER_19]: There's nothing.

873
01:13:12,280 --> 01:13:17,842
[SPEAKER_19]: It was before, I think, some wasabi store or ice cream store next to the UPS.

874
01:13:19,242 --> 01:13:19,462
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

875
01:13:19,482 --> 01:13:20,343
[SPEAKER_19]: So now it's nothing.

876
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,063
[SPEAKER_19]: Now it's empty.

877
01:13:21,443 --> 01:13:21,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

878
01:13:21,703 --> 01:13:22,724
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

879
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:25,865
[SPEAKER_04]: There was supposed to be another restaurant that was supposed to go in there and never went in there.

880
01:13:26,545 --> 01:13:26,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

881
01:13:26,825 --> 01:13:28,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to make sure I had the right address here.

882
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:29,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

883
01:13:31,166 --> 01:13:31,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

884
01:13:32,147 --> 01:13:32,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Any other questions?

885
01:13:33,487 --> 01:13:34,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

886
01:13:35,127 --> 01:13:35,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

887
01:13:37,028 --> 01:13:37,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

888
01:13:38,288 --> 01:13:45,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to reflect the report that the fire department report says pending final inspection.

889
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:57,073
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would ask that any approval of the council be contingent upon approval of final inspection by the fire department and the chief of the fire department.

890
01:13:58,885 --> 01:13:59,905
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

891
01:14:01,206 --> 01:14:08,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

892
01:14:08,168 --> 01:14:09,869
[SPEAKER_17]: That is approved by Councilor Marks.

893
01:14:11,889 --> 01:14:12,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions?

894
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:18,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Cernovich, any email traffic coming through to you?

895
01:14:20,432 --> 01:14:21,773
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm checking, Mr. President.

896
01:14:26,134 --> 01:14:26,954
[SPEAKER_16]: There are no emails.

897

936
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:47,187
[SPEAKER_17]: 0-299 offered by Councilor Morell and Councilor Villescaz.

937
01:15:50,482 --> 01:16:08,857
[SPEAKER_17]: We have resolved that the city council collaborate with the city administration to create a one-page coronavirus information sheet that can be physically delivered to every Medford resident and small business owner containing public health and safety information, emergency resources, and instructions on where to get more information.

938
01:16:09,317 --> 01:16:09,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Morell.

939
01:16:11,179 --> 01:16:12,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

940
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:19,766
[SPEAKER_10]: First, I want to start off commending the administration for the sheer amount of information they've been presenting online through reverse 911, social media,

941
01:16:21,293 --> 01:16:25,574
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely been helpful in these times when everything is changing so fast.

942
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:29,875
[SPEAKER_10]: But there is still a certain amount of our community that might not be reached by these measures.

943
01:16:30,255 --> 01:16:47,579
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's definitely whatever we can do to get a mailing out to or a physical piece of mail out to our residents so that they understand not only what's going on in the city, but relevant to recent congressional policy that's been passed as far as how it impacts individuals,

944
01:16:47,986 --> 01:16:51,828
[SPEAKER_10]: those seeking unemployment, as well as small businesses and that whole program.

945
01:16:51,888 --> 01:16:55,931
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, I do understand that everything is changing by the minute.

946
01:16:56,011 --> 01:17:02,714
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you can see it just in this meeting, the fact that where stuff is being withdrawn because stuff has changed in the few days since we submitted.

947
01:17:03,115 --> 01:17:12,240
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do think it's important that we view an opportunity to work with the administration to do a print material to reach people we might not be reaching otherwise.

948
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:15,061
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

949
01:17:15,101 --> 01:17:15,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears.

950
01:17:17,022 --> 01:17:17,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

951
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:21,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think everything Councilor Morell just said is correct.

952
01:17:22,727 --> 01:17:28,132
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do understand now City Hall is closed to staff and employees as well.

953
01:17:28,292 --> 01:17:40,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if we were to move ahead on this, understand the ability of city staff to participate in this while the building is closed, you know, want to be think we can be cognizant of that and

954
01:17:40,673 --> 01:17:54,675
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a great opportunity for the mayor's office and the council to collaborate, get something out with both of our messages on it so that they can see all of city government working for them and providing the information that they need in this time.

955
01:17:55,996 --> 01:17:56,976
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Peers.

956
01:17:57,516 --> 01:17:58,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Caraviello.

957
01:17:59,196 --> 01:17:59,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

958
01:18:00,576 --> 01:18:04,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, though, this is a good measure by both of our councilors.

959
01:18:05,897 --> 01:18:09,978
[SPEAKER_04]: As Councilor Morell said earlier, isn't it changing by the moment?

960
01:18:10,828 --> 01:18:13,992
[SPEAKER_04]: And anything we send out today, probably tomorrow isn't going to be the same.

961
01:18:14,452 --> 01:18:19,538
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, this message is coming from Governor Baker, from the mayor, from the president.

962
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:21,720
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many messages going out there.

963
01:18:23,022 --> 01:18:32,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if we're confusing people with sending them something that, by the time they get it, may not even be accurate anymore.

964
01:18:32,972 --> 01:18:40,077
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say, City Hall right now is stretched thin as it is, especially we're being closed today.

965
01:18:40,858 --> 01:18:55,228
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a good thing, but I'm concerned about sending out something that by the time people get it, it could be wrong and it might cause further confusion to the residents of Medford.

966
01:18:57,370 --> 01:18:59,752
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

967
01:19:00,052 --> 01:19:01,333
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears, did you want to comment?

968
01:19:01,865 --> 01:19:05,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I completely hear you on that council vice president Kirby yellow.

969
01:19:05,468 --> 01:19:14,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think we were hoping to focus on some of the things that might be more Certain like these are the locations for food service pantries.

970
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:18,398
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the options for some housing You can call if you're having an issue with housing.

971
01:19:18,438 --> 01:19:19,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hear you.

972
01:19:19,779 --> 01:19:27,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I understand that people are stretched in So I think you're working along a timeline and including information that that we know isn't going to change quickly is is important.

973
01:19:27,885 --> 01:19:30,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just think we should we should do our

974
01:19:30,988 --> 01:19:35,732
[SPEAKER_02]: do everything we can to get information out to everybody because this is a time we need everybody to be in the loop.

975
01:19:37,093 --> 01:19:38,094
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

976
01:19:38,834 --> 01:19:40,676
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other comments from the Council?

977
01:19:45,099 --> 01:19:47,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, anyone else that has questions?

978
01:19:49,062 --> 01:19:49,763
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Costas.

979
01:19:50,483 --> 01:19:52,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, John Costas, 56 Hayne Street.

980
01:19:55,187 --> 01:19:59,631
[SPEAKER_01]: What Councilor Cavill was saying is really is, I support it.

981
01:20:00,452 --> 01:20:13,022
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chamber of Commerce we've been sending out a whole lot of information, both on Facebook and emails, and I'm getting bombarded with all kinds of information from other chambers, and all the chambers are sharing the same information.

982
01:20:13,904 --> 01:20:16,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm finding out is all the information is all correct.

983
01:20:17,425 --> 01:20:21,667
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all saying the same thing but the problem is, it's saying in different ways.

984
01:20:22,267 --> 01:20:24,647
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just when you think you understand it.

985
01:20:25,348 --> 01:20:28,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone else said something out and I've been limiting how much I send out.

986
01:20:29,489 --> 01:20:36,051
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been pretty much gone with whatever the city of Medford, sending out for information to everybody.

987
01:20:37,312 --> 01:20:38,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree that.

988
01:20:39,118 --> 01:20:44,882
[SPEAKER_01]: A simplified version is definitely needed to help the businesses and the residents to understand what's going on.

989
01:20:45,462 --> 01:20:51,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we send out too many things, it's just gonna really make it worse than it is.

990
01:20:51,407 --> 01:20:56,470
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of confused people out there from very, very good information.

991
01:20:58,231 --> 01:20:58,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree.

992
01:20:58,972 --> 01:20:59,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

993
01:20:59,953 --> 01:21:00,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

994
01:21:01,133 --> 01:21:03,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Morell and then Vice President Caraviello.

995
01:21:04,616 --> 01:21:05,496
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

996
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, to to Councilor Baer's point, I think it's

997
01:21:08,222 --> 01:21:10,464
[SPEAKER_10]: It's including information that's not gonna change.

998
01:21:10,504 --> 01:21:12,386
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the city services that are available to people.

999
01:21:12,466 --> 01:21:25,577
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we also have to look at this through an equity lens and not every house has access to the internet or they follow on Facebook or they signed up for the reverse 911s and all that.

1000
01:21:25,757 --> 01:21:30,321
[SPEAKER_10]: There are people that are not aware of the resources that the city has right now.

1001
01:21:30,641 --> 01:21:36,786
[SPEAKER_10]: And there may very well be people who actually they need those resources and they don't have the information about them because of the methods

1002
01:21:37,196 --> 01:21:38,777
[SPEAKER_10]: of dissemination we have used so far.

1003
01:21:41,257 --> 01:21:42,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1004
01:21:42,938 --> 01:21:43,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Caraviello.

1005
01:21:44,518 --> 01:21:47,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I think the message is out there.

1006
01:21:47,779 --> 01:21:52,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the food bank is serving over 1,500 people a day.

1007
01:21:53,281 --> 01:21:55,982
[SPEAKER_04]: The lines are nonstop there, so obviously people know about that.

1008
01:21:56,522 --> 01:21:57,843
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, people know about testing.

1009
01:21:58,204 --> 01:22:11,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know how much more information uh, we can get out to people at this time again, uh, The again, yeah, I mean everyone has access to a television and to see again on television They're watching the president.

1010
01:22:11,314 --> 01:22:12,275
[SPEAKER_04]: They're watching the governor.

1011
01:22:12,615 --> 01:22:16,618
[SPEAKER_04]: They're watching they they're watching, uh mayor walsh in boston.

1012
01:22:16,638 --> 01:22:18,620
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, the message is getting out there.

1013
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:21,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody everybody watches television and um

1014
01:22:22,785 --> 01:22:28,466
[SPEAKER_04]: people are accessing the resources that the city of Medford does have and they're operating.

1015
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:43,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, the tax and overburden city staff right now is just, I feel, a waste of our time, again, with the message changing moment to moment.

1016
01:22:44,249 --> 01:22:50,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And like the president of the chamber said, everyone's saying the same thing and just using different words.

1017
01:22:51,590 --> 01:22:53,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how much more we can send out.

1018
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:55,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we were calling people.

1019
01:22:58,992 --> 01:23:01,873
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think we hit almost every senior in the city.

1020
01:23:03,594 --> 01:23:09,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I don't know how much more information we can give people that they're not getting from their own television.

1021
01:23:11,136 --> 01:23:12,256
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1022
01:23:13,276 --> 01:23:14,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1023
01:23:14,897 --> 01:23:15,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1024
01:23:15,717 --> 01:23:19,158
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate Councilor Morell and Councilor Villes coming forward with this.

1025
01:23:20,724 --> 01:23:26,208
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been following this and working for municipality and listening to my colleagues that are working on a daily basis.

1026
01:23:26,288 --> 01:23:34,675
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that what we've been hearing is the next seven to 10 days, the next seven to 14 days are the most dangerous days.

1027
01:23:35,035 --> 01:23:39,518
[SPEAKER_15]: They've come out and said some important pieces that we should listen to.

1028
01:23:39,558 --> 01:23:44,302
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you can't go to the doctor's office, you shouldn't go to the supermarket unless you have to.

1029
01:23:45,554 --> 01:23:46,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't have to go to the pharmacy.

1030
01:23:46,635 --> 01:23:47,516
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't go to the pharmacy.

1031
01:23:47,876 --> 01:24:11,778
[SPEAKER_15]: These are the seven to ten days to really stay in the house I think that's where I'm looking at it is if I had a loved one that's working for the city We're trying to to send the message out I I tend to think that we're a little if that's if the message isn't out yet I think this isn't the week to do it having anybody out in harm's way going door-to-door things out where we're interacting with other people and

1032
01:24:12,128 --> 01:24:22,027
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's imperative that we follow what every guideline is telling us throughout this country now, is trying to keep people off the streets and not interacting in any way.

1033
01:24:22,047 --> 01:24:23,029
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think by doing that,

1034
01:24:23,907 --> 01:24:26,348
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just lending to one more person to be on the street.

1035
01:24:26,368 --> 01:24:28,488
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why I don't support this right now.

1036
01:24:28,548 --> 01:24:47,034
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's, you know, I wouldn't want one of my family members that's working for the city to knock on a door or hand it out in the door or touch a mailbox or do something where they have to put this message into people's boxes and then possibly get infected.

1037
01:24:47,074 --> 01:24:50,155
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think right now, especially what we're hearing,

1038
01:24:50,881 --> 01:24:52,302
[SPEAKER_15]: for the next seven to 14 days.

1039
01:24:52,982 --> 01:24:54,603
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's keep everybody off the street.

1040
01:24:54,643 --> 01:24:55,824
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's not add any more to this.

1041
01:24:56,405 --> 01:24:57,265
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

1042
01:24:57,665 --> 01:24:58,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1043
01:24:59,026 --> 01:24:59,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Marks.

1044
01:25:01,128 --> 01:25:02,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1045
01:25:03,209 --> 01:25:10,494
[SPEAKER_13]: I think what this resolution is trying to accomplish is asking that the city council collaborate with the administration.

1046
01:25:11,379 --> 01:25:25,522
[SPEAKER_13]: whether it's a one-page document, whether it's through social media, whatever the avenue may be, I think what this resolution is trying to accomplish is saying, we're here to assist, we're here to help in any way we can do it.

1047
01:25:25,562 --> 01:25:35,464
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that should be the message to the administration, and maybe not saying we need to put together a one-page document and so forth, but we want to be here to assist.

1048
01:25:36,844 --> 01:25:40,545
[SPEAKER_13]: I personally want to do a shout out to our colleague, Councilor Caraviello,

1049
01:25:41,323 --> 01:25:44,265
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been working the food lines, Mr. President.

1050
01:25:44,585 --> 01:25:49,188
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been giving seniors, picking up food, delivering it to their homes.

1051
01:25:49,588 --> 01:25:54,211
[SPEAKER_13]: He's really been active on a level that I think is admirable to be quite honest with you.

1052
01:25:54,231 --> 01:25:57,673
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd like to thank Councilor Caraviello in his own way, Mr. President.

1053
01:25:58,013 --> 01:26:00,855
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's what people are doing now in their own way.

1054
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:02,136
[SPEAKER_13]: They're trying to assist.

1055
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:08,646
[SPEAKER_13]: And as members of the council, I think we all want to assist the administration in helping get the message out.

1056
01:26:08,706 --> 01:26:16,254
[SPEAKER_13]: So I support this, whether it's a document, whether it's anything, I support this and what it's trying to accomplish.

1057
01:26:16,747 --> 01:26:17,788
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1058
01:26:17,868 --> 01:26:19,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1059
01:26:19,328 --> 01:26:21,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli had a point of information.

1060
01:26:21,449 --> 01:26:22,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1061
01:26:22,670 --> 01:26:25,071
[SPEAKER_15]: If that's the way it was read, I would welcome that.

1062
01:26:25,411 --> 01:26:29,593
[SPEAKER_15]: But it says, the sheets that can be physically delivered to every Method resident.

1063
01:26:29,673 --> 01:26:30,353
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what it says.

1064
01:26:30,794 --> 01:26:31,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right.

1065
01:26:31,894 --> 01:26:39,318
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that doing something in one message is one thing, but to deliver it to every home right now, I can't support that.

1066
01:26:39,358 --> 01:26:39,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1067
01:26:40,118 --> 01:26:41,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1068
01:26:41,959 --> 01:26:42,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears.

1069
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:45,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that the phrase physically delivered was,

1070
01:26:47,230 --> 01:26:50,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It did not mean getting people out on the streets, putting it in mailboxes.

1071
01:26:50,352 --> 01:26:54,074
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that that could be interpreted that way.

1072
01:26:54,114 --> 01:26:56,175
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was not the intent of it.

1073
01:26:56,456 --> 01:26:59,778
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be mail, not having people out on the streets, touching mailboxes.

1074
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:01,279
[SPEAKER_02]: So I completely agree with you on that.

1075
01:27:01,319 --> 01:27:05,881
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think to Councilor Marks' point, that is the intent of this, whether it's a one-pager.

1076
01:27:06,282 --> 01:27:11,585
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a one-page document, but it's a PDF online, not something out in physical form, if necessary.

1077
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:15,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the intent of saying mail was just that there's

1078
01:27:17,635 --> 01:27:22,658
[SPEAKER_02]: there are people who aren't online, people who aren't on TV and all of that, and I understand the concerns.

1079
01:27:22,678 --> 01:27:23,778
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information.

1080
01:27:24,499 --> 01:27:32,003
[SPEAKER_15]: If I'm mistaken, I'm not saying it'd be difficult, but I thought Councilor Morell said there are people that don't have the means to get the information.

1081
01:27:32,563 --> 01:27:34,805
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm taking it as we want them to go and deliver.

1082
01:27:34,845 --> 01:27:35,805
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all, that's all I was saying.

1083
01:27:36,085 --> 01:27:39,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, and that was not what my intent was.

1084
01:27:39,507 --> 01:27:44,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I more meant people who aren't on TV or internet, but might get a piece in the mail and see that.

1085
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:48,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1086
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:51,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other comments from the council?

1087
01:27:52,612 --> 01:27:53,473
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Councilor Knight.

1088
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:56,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1089
01:27:57,956 --> 01:28:01,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, I think this is just a request to share information.

1090
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:14,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with Councilor Marks in that regard, is that the council, from time to time, whatever the issue may be, not just coronavirus, whether it comes to something as simple as street sweeping or

1091
01:28:15,851 --> 01:28:17,412
[SPEAKER_08]: road work that's being done in the neighborhood.

1092
01:28:18,333 --> 01:28:20,395
[SPEAKER_08]: We want the residents to know what's going on in the community.

1093
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:32,705
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think the most important thing is that we deliver a consistent message across government, between the school committee, the council, the Board of Health, the administration.

1094
01:28:33,025 --> 01:28:37,288
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to deliver a consistent message, Mr. President, because if we don't, it's irresponsible.

1095
01:28:37,949 --> 01:28:39,150
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the number one thing.

1096
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:40,871
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all for sharing information with people.

1097
01:28:40,911 --> 01:28:42,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all for doing reverse 911s.

1098
01:28:43,273 --> 01:28:44,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at it and saying,

1099
01:28:45,415 --> 01:28:48,938
[SPEAKER_08]: at $0.21 a postcard to the 20,000 households in the city.

1100
01:28:48,998 --> 01:28:55,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we can get out of this relatively cheap if that's what our intention is to do, is to mail an information sheet to everybody.

1101
01:28:55,563 --> 01:28:58,785
[SPEAKER_08]: It's something that's going to be relatively inexpensive, a drop in the bucket.

1102
01:28:59,206 --> 01:29:00,367
[SPEAKER_08]: You're looking at $182 million budget, Mr. President.

1103
01:29:02,648 --> 01:29:15,794
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I think that the most important item in this whole entire discussion is that the message is delivered as a consistent message across all levels of government so that the residents in this community understand what's going on.

1104
01:29:16,474 --> 01:29:23,097
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't tell you how many calls I got from people saying they didn't think they have to pay their rent on April 1st after last week's meeting, Mr. President.

1105
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:28,299
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so it's dangerous when we're delivering a message that's not consistent across the board.

1106
01:29:28,759 --> 01:29:29,560
[SPEAKER_08]: is all I'm saying.

1107
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:36,283
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it is very important moving forward, Mr. President, that the message is consistent and in lockstep with that of the administration in the school.

1108
01:29:39,345 --> 01:29:40,165
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1109
01:29:41,746 --> 01:29:43,007
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions from the Council?

1110
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:49,030
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Slayton.

1111
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:52,641
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, Craig Slayton, 54 Dover Street again.

1112
01:29:52,661 --> 01:29:58,303
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's wonderful that you're all discussing this.

1113
01:29:59,804 --> 01:30:13,950
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of people still are working, healthcare, foods, food retail, other businesses, and a lot of workers are really concerned about their exposures and their health and safety.

1114
01:30:14,650 --> 01:30:25,393
[SPEAKER_22]: And the Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health tomorrow, I believe, will release a website with lots of information about what people can do to stay healthy.

1115
01:30:25,533 --> 01:30:36,876
[SPEAKER_22]: And I can provide that link if you want to add that to the fact sheet, just as a way for people who are working to get information about what they need to protect themselves.

1116
01:30:37,176 --> 01:30:39,697
[SPEAKER_22]: And if it's too much to put on a list, that's fine.

1117
01:30:39,717 --> 01:30:40,857
[SPEAKER_22]: We can get it out other ways.

1118
01:30:40,937 --> 01:30:41,957
[SPEAKER_22]: But I thought I'd offer it.

1119
01:30:42,358 --> 01:30:42,678
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1120
01:30:43,358 --> 01:30:43,678
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1121
01:30:47,408 --> 01:30:48,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions?

1122
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:51,871
[SPEAKER_17]: Clerk Carter-Beast, you received any emails?

1123
01:30:54,693 --> 01:30:55,814
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, I have not.

1124
01:30:55,834 --> 01:30:56,755
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1125
01:30:57,596 --> 01:31:02,119
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Morell and Councilor Bears, seconded by?

1126
01:31:05,161 --> 01:31:05,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President?

1127
01:31:06,462 --> 01:31:07,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Marks?

1128
01:31:08,344 --> 01:31:11,366
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could, I just want to make sure we're all on the same page then.

1129
01:31:12,303 --> 01:31:15,905
[SPEAKER_13]: This is not specifically asking for a one-page document.

1130
01:31:16,325 --> 01:31:20,987
[SPEAKER_13]: We're asking just that information and collaboration be done.

1131
01:31:21,067 --> 01:31:21,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that correct?

1132
01:31:23,288 --> 01:31:23,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1133
01:31:23,548 --> 01:31:28,530
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm under the impression, but Councilor Bears and Councilor Morell, would you like to comment?

1134
01:31:30,311 --> 01:31:36,273
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to propose an amendment to that effect if that clarification is helpful.

1135
01:31:36,293 --> 01:31:37,114
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be helpful.

1136
01:31:38,613 --> 01:31:50,980
[SPEAKER_02]: and striking to create a one-page coronavirus information sheet that can be physically delivered, and adding to create a coronavirus information sheet that can be delivered.

1137
01:31:53,982 --> 01:31:55,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that still too specific?

1138
01:31:56,063 --> 01:31:58,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I can even make it less specific if we want to do that.

1139
01:31:58,384 --> 01:32:01,106
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it could be mailed.

1140
01:32:01,126 --> 01:32:04,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilman Marks, did you have a question?

1141
01:32:06,428 --> 01:32:09,069
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I, you know, I don't think we have to put the delivery in there.

1142
01:32:09,709 --> 01:32:13,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Let the administration do their job and decide how they want to disseminate the information.

1143
01:32:14,191 --> 01:32:14,551
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1144
01:32:14,571 --> 01:32:14,831
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

1145
01:32:15,131 --> 01:32:19,913
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, vice president cabio.

1146
01:32:20,433 --> 01:32:21,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, thank you, mr. President.

1147
01:32:21,533 --> 01:32:23,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, uh, I agree with Councilor Marks.

1148
01:32:23,494 --> 01:32:31,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, uh, I think we should let the, let the administration decide how they want to get the message out there by, uh, uh, a nine one, one call or, uh,

1149
01:32:32,685 --> 01:32:38,109
[SPEAKER_04]: via mail or whatever, Channel 3 or whatever, however they want to get it out there.

1150
01:32:38,129 --> 01:32:45,855
[SPEAKER_04]: But like Councilor Knight said, the objective is we need to stay consistent.

1151
01:32:46,916 --> 01:32:49,838
[SPEAKER_04]: We support the administration and what they're doing.

1152
01:32:50,999 --> 01:32:52,941
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, that's what the message has to be.

1153
01:32:53,341 --> 01:32:54,242
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't be going off.

1154
01:32:55,172 --> 01:32:57,813
[SPEAKER_04]: on different tangents, saying different things.

1155
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:03,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So I say, let the mayor and the administration decide how they wanna get the message out.

1156
01:33:04,196 --> 01:33:09,139
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I think we're all on board on what the mayor has been doing in the administration so far with this.

1157
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:11,660
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1158
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1159
01:33:14,101 --> 01:33:14,521
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm all set.

1160
01:33:15,001 --> 01:33:15,622
[SPEAKER_17]: You're all set, okay.

1161
01:33:16,502 --> 01:33:17,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions from the council?

1162
01:33:19,643 --> 01:33:22,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Bears and Councilor Morell,

1163
01:33:23,640 --> 01:33:25,301
[SPEAKER_17]: as amended by Councilor Bears.

1164
01:33:26,842 --> 01:33:26,982
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1165

[SPEAKER_17]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1166

[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, it's seconded by Councilor Marks?

1167
01:33:31,925 --> 01:33:32,145
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1168
01:33:33,786 --> 01:33:34,947
[SPEAKER_17]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1169
01:33:37,849 --> 01:33:38,469
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears?

01:33:38,969 --> 01:33:39,190
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1171
01:33:40,270 --> 01:33:41,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caraviello?

1172
01:33:41,471 --> 01:33:41,691
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1173
01:33:42,352 --> 01:33:42,832
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight?

1174
01:33:43,572 --> 01:33:43,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1175
01:33:44,493 --> 01:33:45,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks?

1176
01:33:45,574 --> 01:33:45,834
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1177
01:33:46,234 --> 01:33:46,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell?

1178
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:47,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1179
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:48,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1180
01:33:49,304 --> 01:33:49,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1181
01:33:50,065 --> 01:33:50,865
[SPEAKER_16]: President Falco?

1182
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:51,365
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1183
01:33:51,665 --> 01:33:58,908
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1184
01:33:58,928 --> 01:34:01,309
[SPEAKER_17]: 2-0-300 offered by Councilor Bears.

1185
01:34:01,589 --> 01:34:05,490
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it resolved that the city administration establish a housing stability task force

1186
01:34:06,018 --> 01:34:10,901
[SPEAKER_17]: to pull together information and guidance regarding housing resources and assistance for Medford residents.

1187
01:34:11,441 --> 01:34:23,207
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it further resolved that the city of Medford establish a housing stability hotline that residents can call to receive information about federal, state, and city resources regarding housing stability.

1188
01:34:23,787 --> 01:34:30,411
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it further resolved that the city of Medford work together with private landlords to cease all activities that require landlords, inspectors,

1189
01:34:31,311 --> 01:34:54,181
[SPEAKER_17]: or assesses to enter housing units with current occupants for the duration of the crisis, to seize any threat or eviction or utility shutoffs, to provide information about state and federal resources regarding mortgages and other available assistance to tenants and homeowners, and to work with tenants and landlords facing financial hardships to address rent payments.

1190
01:34:54,561 --> 01:34:55,281
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears.

1191
01:34:56,122 --> 01:34:57,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1192
01:34:57,683 --> 01:34:58,383
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have

1193
01:34:59,552 --> 01:35:02,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the text is pretty explanatory at face value.

1194
01:35:03,976 --> 01:35:22,271
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea here would be to work with the city administration to get a group together of people who are working on different housing issues I know that chairperson Cameron has been working on some stuff with CPA, the acting chair LaRue of Community Development Board has been working on some stuff around Community Development Board.

1195
01:35:23,019 --> 01:35:25,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Um as well as many other people alicia hunt and others.

1196
01:35:25,941 --> 01:35:31,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the idea would be to bring those folks together make sure that we are are That everyone is aligned.

1197
01:35:31,964 --> 01:35:33,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that we're moving forward together.

1198
01:35:33,746 --> 01:35:35,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone knows what each other's doing.

1199
01:35:35,106 --> 01:35:43,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, And then also, uh to create a hotline so have it on the city website This is where you can call if you're looking for information or assistance.

1200
01:35:44,032 --> 01:35:44,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then

1201
01:35:45,178 --> 01:35:58,105
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's a variety of things that we could work on through that, including entry to units, um, eviction and utility shutoffs, which I know the mayor has an executive order on, or that the, there has been an action on some of that.

1202
01:35:58,425 --> 01:36:03,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then especially providing resources regarding mortgage, um,

1203
01:36:05,451 --> 01:36:08,452
[SPEAKER_02]: and other assistance that's available from the state and federal level.

1204
01:36:08,612 --> 01:36:20,257
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spoken with the mayor, Director Hunt, Acting Director Hunt from Community Development, as well as some other folks regarding this, and it seems like there's willingness to do this.

1205
01:36:20,957 --> 01:36:24,098
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be trying to coordinate some of that with folks.

1206
01:36:24,138 --> 01:36:25,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be great to

1207
01:36:27,791 --> 01:36:32,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to pitch in my help and labor and try to take some of that pressure off that some of my fellow Councilors have mentioned.

1208
01:36:32,712 --> 01:36:34,112
[SPEAKER_02]: People are very stretched in right now.

1209
01:36:34,132 --> 01:36:35,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the mayor welcomed that.

1210
01:36:35,313 --> 01:36:38,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping that we can endorse that approach as well.

1211
01:36:39,154 --> 01:36:42,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And as folks have said, continue moving with one message on this.

1212
01:36:44,095 --> 01:36:45,075
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Perez.

1213
01:36:45,095 --> 01:36:46,055
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Caraviello.

1214
01:36:46,315 --> 01:36:47,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1215
01:36:47,115 --> 01:36:52,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I think this measure is far more important to send out than the one we just voted on.

1216
01:36:54,486 --> 01:36:58,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is where the real problem is going to come to the city of Medford.

1217
01:37:00,012 --> 01:37:02,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, this week, our tax bills came out last week.

1218
01:37:03,195 --> 01:37:04,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Water bills came out last week.

1219
01:37:05,378 --> 01:37:08,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where people are going to start to feel the crunch on this.

1220
01:37:09,062 --> 01:37:15,689
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say, I'd rather this letter be sent out to every household versus the one

1221
01:37:16,189 --> 01:37:29,832
[SPEAKER_04]: than 299 because this is a very, very, very important thing that landlords know what they should be doing with their tenants and the rules and what's expected of them.

1222
01:37:30,293 --> 01:37:39,015
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I said, if this can be incorporated with the other one, with 299, I feel that this is much more important than 299 is.

1223
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:46,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Because these are things that I've talked about on television and people don't get the word out on.

1224
01:37:46,773 --> 01:37:51,556
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, this year I do support what I said.

1225
01:37:52,337 --> 01:37:57,380
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to combine it with 299, that would be fine too.

1226
01:37:57,721 --> 01:38:00,102
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is where the real information needs to come out now.

1227
01:38:01,103 --> 01:38:02,464
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1228
01:38:03,025 --> 01:38:05,947
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Morell had her hand up to Councilor Bears.

1229
01:38:07,317 --> 01:38:08,077
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1230
01:38:08,097 --> 01:38:11,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just want to thank Councilor Bears for bringing this forth.

1231
01:38:11,158 --> 01:38:12,898
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is really important right now.

1232
01:38:12,958 --> 01:38:18,380
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're kind of building the plane as we're flying it as this crisis necessitates.

1233
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:26,582
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think setting up teams like this, task force like this to respond to the pressing needs of our community are really important.

1234
01:38:26,922 --> 01:38:29,943
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, getting that cohesive messaging moving forward too as well.

1235
01:38:30,123 --> 01:38:32,403
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thank him and I look forward to supporting this.

1236
01:38:33,663 --> 01:38:34,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1237
01:38:35,124 --> 01:38:35,724
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears.

1238
01:38:36,418 --> 01:38:43,840
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think to Vice President Caraviello's point, when I was thinking of what was in 299, this is the kind of thing I was thinking of wanting to include in something like that.

1239
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:56,244
[SPEAKER_02]: So providing, you know, this is where you can find housing resources from the city and have, you know, that be on the website, but have some of that information there, food resources, kind of all of the different ways the city is helping residents right now.

1240
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:57,424
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was what I had in mind.

1241
01:38:57,484 --> 01:38:59,365
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would 100% support what you just said.

1242
01:38:59,385 --> 01:39:01,706
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1243
01:39:02,066 --> 01:39:03,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions from the council?

1244
01:39:05,887 --> 01:39:06,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1245
01:39:07,403 --> 01:39:09,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Caraviello.

1246
01:39:09,324 --> 01:39:17,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President, I'd like to amend that to have it go out along with 299 at the same time.

1247
01:39:20,308 --> 01:39:23,249
[SPEAKER_04]: In the same package, however we want to do it.

1248
01:39:24,989 --> 01:39:27,630
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Pizza and Councilor Morell, are you okay with the amendment?

1249
01:39:29,391 --> 01:39:29,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1250
01:39:30,031 --> 01:39:31,332
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's just mine, but yes.

1251
01:39:31,892 --> 01:39:32,352
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1252
01:39:32,372 --> 01:39:32,692
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1253
01:39:33,152 --> 01:39:33,793
[SPEAKER_17]: You are corrected.

1254
01:39:33,853 --> 01:39:34,953
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry.

1255
01:39:37,011 --> 01:39:40,154
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay then, any other questions from the council?

1256
01:39:42,015 --> 01:39:43,757
[SPEAKER_17]: Does anyone else have, oh, Councilor Marks.

1257
01:39:44,737 --> 01:39:45,698
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1258
01:39:45,838 --> 01:39:49,621
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just a little confused on what exactly would go out.

1259
01:39:50,382 --> 01:39:54,405
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, this is the creation of a housing stability hotline.

1260
01:39:55,306 --> 01:39:59,950
[SPEAKER_13]: It also involves, I know, some other language regarding landlords and tenants and so forth.

1261
01:40:01,173 --> 01:40:04,395
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not quite sure we were just discussing not confusing people.

1262
01:40:04,895 --> 01:40:11,739
[SPEAKER_13]: And now we're talking about adding document after document, sending it out to people, which I think may be very confusing.

1263
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:17,422
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're talking to someone that actually works in housing stabilization for the state.

1264
01:40:18,522 --> 01:40:22,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I deal with thousands of homeless families on a daily basis.

1265
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:25,702
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is something very near and dear to me.

1266
01:40:26,182 --> 01:40:31,485
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think what you have to do, Mr. President, is do it in a way that makes sense.

1267
01:40:32,025 --> 01:40:40,410
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we're going to create a hotline and potentially even a task force, then I think we have to lay the foundation first.

1268
01:40:40,830 --> 01:40:43,091
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to crawl before you run.

1269
01:40:43,531 --> 01:40:44,952
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think we're trying to run first.

1270
01:40:45,392 --> 01:40:51,235
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we should do our homework first and then look at disseminating information.

1271
01:40:52,084 --> 01:40:52,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1272
01:40:52,364 --> 01:40:52,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1273
01:40:52,564 --> 01:40:52,804
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1274
01:40:52,824 --> 01:40:53,004
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1275
01:40:53,024 --> 01:40:53,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1276
01:40:53,224 --> 01:40:53,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Consulate Marks.

1277
01:40:53,565 --> 01:40:54,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Consulate bears.

1278
01:40:54,445 --> 01:41:02,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think to that point, um, I would think that we would develop something to be sent out after we kind of went through this process of getting people together.

1279
01:41:02,428 --> 01:41:02,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're right.

1280
01:41:02,968 --> 01:41:04,028
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to get everyone together.

1281
01:41:04,528 --> 01:41:10,450
[SPEAKER_02]: See what everyone's doing and then put something out so that that would be how I would like to work with the administration to approach it.

1282
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:14,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Um I think some of what would be included is in this third paragraph of the resolution.

1283
01:41:15,352 --> 01:41:15,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like

1284
01:41:22,013 --> 01:41:23,436
[SPEAKER_02]: that document hasn't been created yet.

1285
01:41:23,476 --> 01:41:25,018
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't had those conversations.

1286
01:41:25,098 --> 01:41:30,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we would put something out after these folks got together to have those conversations.

1287
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:54,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Just if I could I think we have to be mindful over the last several months We've sent dozens of requests to the city administration Working on a lot of different issues and requesting a lot of different things There's nothing that precludes of the council

1288
01:41:54,693 --> 01:42:00,256
[SPEAKER_13]: to get together in a subcommittee or a committee that would be appropriate to the topic and discussing.

1289
01:42:00,756 --> 01:42:02,177
[SPEAKER_13]: We can create a task force.

1290
01:42:02,757 --> 01:42:05,278
[SPEAKER_13]: The city administration doesn't have to create a task force.

1291
01:42:05,778 --> 01:42:10,701
[SPEAKER_13]: We as a council could do a lot of things legislatively and move issues forward.

1292
01:42:11,301 --> 01:42:24,447
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not saying I don't want to work with the city administration, but I just hate to see everything passed off to administration that's already in the midst of dealing with this horrible, uh, you know, Corona that's out there.

1293
01:42:24,907 --> 01:42:31,431
[SPEAKER_13]: a million things on their plate, and I just hate to say, well, here's another thing that we want you to do on top of that.

1294
01:42:31,991 --> 01:42:34,953
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd like to see the council take control.

1295
01:42:35,493 --> 01:42:37,214
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, send it to a subcommittee.

1296
01:42:37,794 --> 01:42:41,476
[SPEAKER_13]: We can call in all the different department heads and parties as a council.

1297
01:42:41,856 --> 01:42:42,797
[SPEAKER_13]: We can unite this.

1298
01:42:42,877 --> 01:42:43,817
[SPEAKER_13]: We can work on it.

1299
01:42:44,558 --> 01:42:48,820
[SPEAKER_13]: There's really no need other than to get support from the administration

1300
01:42:49,372 --> 01:42:51,652
[SPEAKER_13]: that the council can't run with this.

1301
01:42:52,233 --> 01:43:06,895
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to see more emphasis on the council and less emphasis on city administration, city administration, city administration, knowing that I believe they're already inundated and they're barely keeping their head above water now.

1302
01:43:07,575 --> 01:43:11,376
[SPEAKER_13]: And to add another task is gonna be extremely difficult.

1303
01:43:11,716 --> 01:43:15,116
[SPEAKER_13]: It may take their focus off something that is vital.

1304
01:43:16,777 --> 01:43:18,237
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is a very important issue,

1305
01:43:18,593 --> 01:43:20,334
[SPEAKER_13]: but I think we can accomplish this as well.

1306
01:43:21,054 --> 01:43:22,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1307
01:43:22,295 --> 01:43:24,476
[SPEAKER_17]: We have Councilor Bears and Vice President Caraviello.

1308
01:43:25,417 --> 01:43:28,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I think on general principle, I don't disagree with you, Councilor Marks.

1309
01:43:28,498 --> 01:43:32,960
[SPEAKER_02]: On this specific issue, again, I spoke with the mayor and some other folks.

1310
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:40,004
[SPEAKER_02]: They would see if we, I'm volunteering my personal time to help with this as a councilor as well.

1311
01:43:42,365 --> 01:43:46,187
[SPEAKER_02]: So they see it as taking something off their plate and helping to bring these things together.

1312
01:43:46,767 --> 01:43:53,591
[SPEAKER_02]: While the city staff has stretched in specifically on this issue, I don't disagree that I think we should do a lot more as a council and take more ownership.

1313
01:43:54,252 --> 01:44:00,755
[SPEAKER_02]: But on this issue at this time, I think to the point that some other Councilors have made, we need to speak with one voice, have that work.

1314
01:44:00,835 --> 01:44:09,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've spoken with the administration and they see this as a chance to both collaborate, get the message out and actually try to take some work off the plate of staff who are stretched right now.

1315
01:44:12,016 --> 01:44:12,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1316
01:44:12,977 --> 01:44:14,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Caraviello had a comment.

1317
01:44:14,918 --> 01:44:15,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1318
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:17,580
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Marks is right.

1319
01:44:17,621 --> 01:44:19,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we were jumping the gun a little bit there.

1320
01:44:20,022 --> 01:44:24,306
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a... Rick, you just went on mute.

1321
01:44:24,346 --> 01:44:24,886
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't hear you.

1322
01:44:28,850 --> 01:44:29,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1323
01:44:30,651 --> 01:44:32,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Council Marks is right.

1324
01:44:32,573 --> 01:44:39,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we did jump a little bit before.

1325
01:44:39,939 --> 01:44:41,580
[SPEAKER_04]: We do have a subcommittee on housing.

1326
01:44:42,691 --> 01:44:43,512
[SPEAKER_04]: if I'm not mistaken.

1327
01:44:44,312 --> 01:44:51,638
[SPEAKER_04]: And Council Marks with his resources, with his job would be an excellent source of information on this also.

1328
01:44:52,098 --> 01:44:58,904
[SPEAKER_04]: So I say, I don't have a problem sending this to a subcommittee for immediate action, if you wanna do that also.

1329
01:45:02,106 --> 01:45:07,470
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Peers, you are actually the subcommittee chair of elderly and housing affairs.

1330
01:45:08,371 --> 01:45:10,472
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure if that's what you wanna do with this,

1331
01:45:13,117 --> 01:45:20,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be happy to send it for discussion at a committee meeting subcommittee meeting if we could try to schedule it for next week.

1332
01:45:21,003 --> 01:45:21,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be good.

1333
01:45:22,084 --> 01:45:23,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also know you schedule it whenever you want.

1334
01:45:24,266 --> 01:45:25,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there we go.

1335
01:45:25,186 --> 01:45:27,648
[SPEAKER_02]: My first one in a trial by fire.

1336
01:45:28,309 --> 01:45:37,036
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know, we do have a subcommittee meeting that is a committee the whole next Tuesday, as far as you know, Wednesday's wide open.

1337
01:45:37,076 --> 01:45:38,957
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can take that completely up to you.

1338
01:45:39,941 --> 01:45:46,872
[SPEAKER_17]: Before we move forward, if the council doesn't have any further questions, there are a number of people that really want to ask questions.

1339
01:45:47,613 --> 01:45:49,957
[SPEAKER_17]: We have Roberta Cameron and then Kelly Catalo.

1340
01:45:50,017 --> 01:45:51,400
[SPEAKER_17]: So, Roberta Cameron.

1341
01:45:56,557 --> 01:45:58,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you again, Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

1342
01:45:58,938 --> 01:46:01,720
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think I gave my name and address for the record the last time I spoke.

1343
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:08,603
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to first of all point, thank you very much for this effort.

1344
01:46:08,643 --> 01:46:10,284
[SPEAKER_12]: This is spot on.

1345
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:20,590
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to point out that the Office of Community Development has actually already developed a webpage dedicated to emergency housing resources.

1346
01:46:21,271 --> 01:46:28,508
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'd like to see that everyone in the public knows that that page exists on the city's website.

1347
01:46:30,335 --> 01:46:38,261
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got some very important resources, both locally, regionally, the city and federal resources.

1348
01:46:39,302 --> 01:46:40,603
[SPEAKER_12]: So people should be aware of that.

1349
01:46:40,983 --> 01:46:44,125
[SPEAKER_12]: And secondly, I think that it is really critical.

1350
01:46:44,245 --> 01:46:49,489
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be very helpful to actually have a formal housing task force working together.

1351
01:46:49,509 --> 01:46:59,256
[SPEAKER_12]: As Councilor Bears mentioned earlier, the Community Preservation Committee, members of our committee have been working toward

1352
01:47:02,098 --> 01:47:12,695
[SPEAKER_12]: looking at ways that we can utilize CPA resources to be able to provide emergency housing assistance to help people deal with the crisis.

1353
01:47:13,497 --> 01:47:16,081
[SPEAKER_12]: And while this we're going to be hopefully

1354
01:47:17,629 --> 01:47:21,690
[SPEAKER_12]: we'll hopefully have a proposal next week that we can vote on in our committee.

1355
01:47:22,130 --> 01:47:31,993
[SPEAKER_12]: We also need to coordinate with the Office of Community Development and the Community Development Block Grant funding, which provides another set of resources that we can use for the same purpose.

1356
01:47:32,393 --> 01:47:35,574
[SPEAKER_12]: And we all want to be steering the bus in the same direction.

1357
01:47:35,734 --> 01:47:39,815
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would be really helpful if we were formally working together and not just

1358
01:47:41,795 --> 01:47:45,059
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of informally going around in circles each other.

1359
01:47:45,219 --> 01:47:50,065
[SPEAKER_12]: So I agree that it would be, and I know that we're...

1360
01:47:51,106 --> 01:47:58,027
[SPEAKER_12]: It's happening, but if we actually had a task force that was formally meeting, that might be helpful.

1361
01:47:58,447 --> 01:48:09,609
[SPEAKER_12]: I also know that there are a number of other housing initiatives going on right now that might be utilizing the attention of the same people who would be meeting about this.

1362
01:48:09,829 --> 01:48:12,430
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would be sensitive about that as well.

1363
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:15,050
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know.

1364
01:48:15,070 --> 01:48:19,611
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree that it would be helpful, and I also feel that maybe we need to

1365
01:48:21,266 --> 01:48:37,077
[SPEAKER_12]: defer to the administration and the staff and committee members to find the best way to work together in the really short time frame that all of this needs to be pulled together.

1366
01:48:37,917 --> 01:48:38,218
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1367
01:48:46,784 --> 01:48:47,965
[SPEAKER_26]: Hello, Mr. Falco.

1368
01:48:48,465 --> 01:48:51,828
[SPEAKER_26]: So, Zach, this is a great paragraph.

1369
01:48:52,128 --> 01:48:53,569
[SPEAKER_26]: Nobody wants anybody homeless.

1370
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:55,631
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we're all on the same page.

1371
01:48:56,252 --> 01:49:00,535
[SPEAKER_26]: However, there's an awful lot put in here, and it's very compounded.

1372
01:49:01,075 --> 01:49:03,958
[SPEAKER_26]: And what my eyes are going to is a rent freeze.

1373
01:49:04,478 --> 01:49:24,263
[SPEAKER_26]: So if we have a rent freeze we're going to have people in our city that can't pay their mortgages I cannot tell you how many people in our city own two family homes that are 80 years old Relying on their rent payments in order to be able to buy their medicines and buy their food Roberta, I agree with you 100.

1374
01:49:24,863 --> 01:49:27,004
[SPEAKER_26]: We do need a task force

1375
01:49:27,504 --> 01:49:35,587
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think that we need people from the entire circle that touch housing on this task force, so everybody can show what they're seeing.

1376
01:49:35,988 --> 01:49:46,172
[SPEAKER_26]: The landlords and the tenants, and I've talked to so many in the last week, because Adam, I also got a lot of phone calls from tenants who thought that they didn't have to pay their rent this month.

1377
01:49:47,133 --> 01:49:50,397
[SPEAKER_26]: Um, so we need the landlords and the tenants to work it out.

1378
01:49:50,517 --> 01:49:52,380
[SPEAKER_26]: They are working it out.

1379
01:49:52,861 --> 01:50:01,714
[SPEAKER_26]: I think when we put government restrictions on housing and on people's private property, it just kind of makes them angry and it's not good.

1380
01:50:02,114 --> 01:50:04,776
[SPEAKER_26]: You know, nobody is looking to evict tenants today.

1381
01:50:04,796 --> 01:50:07,418
[SPEAKER_26]: I have not heard one person say to me that they want to evict.

1382
01:50:07,858 --> 01:50:11,861
[SPEAKER_26]: I have landlords that are very, very afraid of not getting their rents.

1383
01:50:12,241 --> 01:50:19,185
[SPEAKER_26]: I have landlords that have had tenants serve them notice, and they can't go in their property to re-rent it or to sell it right now.

1384
01:50:19,646 --> 01:50:27,051
[SPEAKER_26]: So I think, again, if we can get everybody into one group and we can come up with a solution that benefits everybody, that could work.

1385
01:50:27,491 --> 01:50:28,971
[SPEAKER_26]: Freezing rents doesn't work.

1386
01:50:29,051 --> 01:50:33,652
[SPEAKER_26]: The only thing that's being offered right now from a lot of mortgage companies is forbearance.

1387
01:50:33,752 --> 01:50:40,433
[SPEAKER_26]: Forbearance means we're going to let you not pay your rent for three months, or your mortgage, but in three months, we want it all.

1388
01:50:40,953 --> 01:50:42,574
[SPEAKER_26]: So if it's a deferment, it's great.

1389
01:50:42,594 --> 01:50:43,534
[SPEAKER_26]: It goes to the end.

1390
01:50:43,814 --> 01:50:49,595
[SPEAKER_26]: But again, if we have a housing task force, we can get the message out to people, we're not going to end up in a mess.

1391
01:50:51,695 --> 01:50:52,075
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1392
01:50:52,755 --> 01:50:53,075
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1393
01:50:56,907 --> 01:51:00,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I don't think a rent freeze is mentioned in here.

1394
01:51:00,189 --> 01:51:02,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I think to your point exactly, we can't do that.

1395
01:51:02,991 --> 01:51:08,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tried as hard as possible last week to say it as many times as possible that that's not what we were doing.

1396
01:51:09,496 --> 01:51:15,660
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten a lot of messages, again, from landlords, tenants, and homeowners who are all really nervous about making payments.

1397
01:51:15,700 --> 01:51:17,782
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hear you on that.

1398
01:51:18,002 --> 01:51:19,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard from many people.

1399
01:51:19,243 --> 01:51:20,744
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we heard some on the call.

1400
01:51:21,024 --> 01:51:23,586
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea here, I think, is not to say

1401
01:51:24,623 --> 01:51:32,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important for us to look at one piece of the puzzle and say, No, you know, it's not just about about rampant saying that we're providing resources sharing the information that's out there.

1402
01:51:32,765 --> 01:51:34,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree.

1403
01:51:34,385 --> 01:51:36,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I think tenants and landlords are coming to agreements.

1404
01:51:36,506 --> 01:51:38,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the most important thing we have to do.

1405
01:51:38,506 --> 01:51:40,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think any way that the city can.

1406
01:51:40,947 --> 01:51:47,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Help provide information that facilitates those agreements or can make sure that landlords and tenants are all in

1407
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:55,942
[SPEAKER_02]: stay in our homes, keep up rent payments, because I think there's the concern, too, right?

1408
01:51:55,982 --> 01:52:01,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the logistics of trying to do something like that in three months, you would have to pay all your rent, too.

1409
01:52:01,404 --> 01:52:04,085
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think people can afford a balloon payment either.

1410
01:52:04,205 --> 01:52:05,426
[SPEAKER_02]: So I completely hear you on that.

1411
01:52:05,466 --> 01:52:06,646
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the aim of this.

1412
01:52:06,706 --> 01:52:13,429
[SPEAKER_02]: It's to make sure everyone has as much information as possible so that they can come to agreements so that everyone can weather this together.

1413
01:52:13,529 --> 01:52:15,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm right there with you on that, Kelly.

1414
01:52:20,900 --> 01:52:29,004
[SPEAKER_26]: I get where you're coming from we're on the same page Zach but I want you to look at your resolution in paragraph for the one that starts with be it further ordered.

1415
01:52:29,704 --> 01:52:36,187
[SPEAKER_26]: If you go down to line five, you did put in there and freeze rent payments.

1416
01:52:36,227 --> 01:52:39,369
[SPEAKER_26]: But this is where I think if we can have a group.

1417
01:52:39,969 --> 01:52:43,831
[SPEAKER_26]: Instead of a resolution, we can get everybody on the same page and help our whole city.

1418
01:52:44,602 --> 01:52:45,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

1419
01:52:45,703 --> 01:52:48,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I withdrew that resolution for that reason.

1420
01:52:48,104 --> 01:52:50,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to amend it last week to remove that as well.

1421
01:52:50,065 --> 01:52:50,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I withdrew 20-293.

1422
01:52:50,485 --> 01:52:51,226
[SPEAKER_02]: We are looking at 20-300.

1423
01:53:12,174 --> 01:53:14,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, John Costas, 56 Hayne Street.

1424
01:53:15,135 --> 01:53:16,476
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great conversation.

1425
01:53:16,496 --> 01:53:28,902
[SPEAKER_01]: It has lots of potential, and I know you're talking more residential and not business, but whatever you decide on doing, everything that everybody's talking about applies to business.

1426
01:53:29,623 --> 01:53:37,947
[SPEAKER_01]: I said at the last meeting that we have a lot of really good commercial landlords out there, and they're worried because

1427
01:53:39,441 --> 01:53:53,625
[SPEAKER_01]: their tenants may not be able to pay the rent and they're not looking to not pay the rent, but you need to provide some kind of funding or some kind of assistance to landlords in the commercial property.

1428
01:53:54,286 --> 01:53:58,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Some, well, they're not all nice, but some of them are really great.

1429
01:53:58,987 --> 01:54:07,970
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whatever you decide to do, if you can tailor it for commercial properties and especially in the business districts, that'd be great.

1430
01:54:08,230 --> 01:54:08,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1431
01:54:09,782 --> 01:54:10,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1432
01:54:14,345 --> 01:54:14,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears.

1433
01:54:16,066 --> 01:54:18,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and John, I hear you on that too.

1434
01:54:18,287 --> 01:54:21,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been following some of the state level legislation on this.

1435
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:31,616
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't been either hasn't been filed or the right things haven't been filed yet, but I'm hoping that we can have future meetings talk about help for the small businesses on that issue as well, because it's a huge issue.

1436
01:54:34,358 --> 01:54:35,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1437
01:54:35,218 --> 01:54:35,699
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

1438
01:54:36,766 --> 01:54:43,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I will say that it's going to be a very long term for the Medford City Council if we debate every single bill that's filed at the state legislature.

1439
01:54:45,293 --> 01:54:53,599
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of the paper that's before us this evening, I think we've talked this item up quite a bit, and I would move for a vote on the topic.

1440
01:54:54,260 --> 01:54:55,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor.

1441
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:58,643
[SPEAKER_17]: We have one more comment from Jason Wilk.

1442
01:55:07,588 --> 01:55:07,969
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe not.

1443
01:55:07,989 --> 01:55:09,610
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

1444
01:55:11,071 --> 01:55:12,872
[SPEAKER_18]: We can, you should be able to talk.

1445
01:55:26,622 --> 01:55:27,123
[SPEAKER_18]: We can't hear you.

1446
01:55:31,522 --> 01:55:37,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President, maybe in the alternative, you can type his question into the chat icon down below and we can read it.

1447
01:55:38,424 --> 01:55:40,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, yeah, he's got to type it now.

1448
01:55:41,886 --> 01:55:45,227
[SPEAKER_18]: While we're waiting for the question, Clerk Carden, do you have any emails that have come in on this issue?

1449
01:55:56,291 --> 01:55:57,591
[SPEAKER_18]: No, Mr. President, I don't.

1450
01:55:58,351 --> 01:55:58,652
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1451
01:56:07,897 --> 01:56:15,541
[SPEAKER_17]: It's my understanding that a rent freeze payments, rent increases while it's a rent moratorium that halts payments.

1452
01:56:15,681 --> 01:56:16,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that right?

1453
01:56:16,262 --> 01:56:21,304
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people are throwing around a lot of terms, but that would be my understanding.

1454
01:56:22,545 --> 01:56:22,785
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1455
01:56:24,046 --> 01:56:24,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1456
01:56:24,406 --> 01:56:26,968
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1457
01:56:26,988 --> 01:56:29,149
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears, did you want this to go to subcommittee?

1458
01:56:30,890 --> 01:56:33,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm fine referring this to elder and housing affairs.

1459
01:56:33,672 --> 01:56:34,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1460
01:56:34,806 --> 01:56:41,830
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion Councilor Bears to move this to the Elderly and Housing Affairs Subcommittee, seconded by?

1461
01:56:41,850 --> 01:56:44,732
[SPEAKER_18]: Second.

1462
01:56:45,532 --> 01:56:46,713
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Councilor Morell.

1463
01:56:48,053 --> 01:56:49,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

1464
01:56:52,936 --> 01:56:53,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears?

1465
01:56:54,177 --> 01:56:54,417
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1466
01:56:55,137 --> 01:56:56,078
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caraviello?

1467
01:57:00,701 --> 01:57:01,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caraviello?

1468
01:57:02,742 --> 01:57:02,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1469
01:57:05,232 --> 01:57:05,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

1470
01:57:08,193 --> 01:57:08,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1471
01:57:10,654 --> 01:57:11,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

1472
01:57:12,254 --> 01:57:12,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1473
01:57:13,054 --> 01:57:13,734
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell.

1474
01:57:14,415 --> 01:57:14,735
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1475
01:57:15,135 --> 01:57:15,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1476
01:57:16,335 --> 01:57:16,555
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1477
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,456
[SPEAKER_16]: President Falco.

1478
01:57:18,936 --> 01:57:19,176
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1479
01:57:19,516 --> 01:57:21,317
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1480
01:57:21,357 --> 01:57:24,698
[SPEAKER_17]: The paper goes to the elderly and housing affairs subcommittee.

1481
01:57:24,778 --> 01:57:33,040
[SPEAKER_17]: That subcommittee is chaired by Councilor Zach Beers and members of that subcommittee are Councilor Marks and Councilor Caraviello.

1482
01:57:36,298 --> 01:57:43,724
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1483
01:57:43,744 --> 01:57:45,125
[SPEAKER_17]: 20-301, offered by Councilor Bears.

1484
01:57:46,767 --> 01:57:59,417
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it ordered by the Medford City Council that the city administration amend the Mayor's 331-2020 executive order regarding the showing of housing units to specify the unoccupied housing units can still be entered and shown.

1485
01:58:00,318 --> 01:58:04,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears, before we continue on this, are you asking, can you clarify that?

1486
01:58:06,091 --> 01:58:08,732
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to, sorry, go ahead.

1487
01:58:09,252 --> 01:58:10,772
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you clarify the resolution?

1488
01:58:10,792 --> 01:58:17,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you asking us to amend it or the city administration to amend it?

1489
01:58:17,274 --> 01:58:19,155
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm asking the city administration to amend it.

1490
01:58:19,175 --> 01:58:22,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we can amend an executive order, my understanding of how that works.

1491
01:58:22,216 --> 01:58:22,976
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would change it.

1492
01:58:23,116 --> 01:58:25,497
[SPEAKER_02]: I would amend it just to say be it resolved instead of be it ordered.

1493
01:58:27,277 --> 01:58:33,219
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so the mayor's 331 executive order, which I think in general is a good thing to say that

1494
01:58:33,792 --> 01:58:37,934
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if you're living in an apartment, you can't have people come into that apartment and show it.

1495
01:58:38,034 --> 01:58:45,678
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's generally a good thing, but the mayor's order doesn't make clear that if a unit is unoccupied, it can be shown, at least from my reading of it.

1496
01:58:45,718 --> 01:58:47,279
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like it to be amended.

1497
01:58:47,319 --> 01:58:52,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've spoken to some folks from real estate industry who have said that it's important to them.

1498
01:58:52,282 --> 01:58:58,325
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Kelly's here and can talk about that as well, but that's just why I put this forward.

1499
01:58:58,345 --> 01:59:00,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you, council members.

1500
01:59:00,246 --> 01:59:03,348
[SPEAKER_17]: Would any council like to, council would like to speak of this before,

1501
01:59:04,102 --> 01:59:05,342
[SPEAKER_17]: I open up for further discussion.

1502
01:59:05,742 --> 01:59:06,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

1503
01:59:07,843 --> 01:59:14,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just wondering if the sponsor of the resolution spoke with the administration and asked for clarification prior to filing the resolution.

1504
01:59:15,544 --> 01:59:15,965
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

1505
01:59:15,985 --> 01:59:20,005
[SPEAKER_02]: They said they would look into it.

1506
01:59:21,366 --> 01:59:28,527
[SPEAKER_08]: So the administration has banned the showing of these units or they haven't?

1507
01:59:30,708 --> 01:59:32,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that's my reading.

1508
01:59:33,367 --> 01:59:36,789
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that some realtors are concerned, they feel that it does ban it.

1509
01:59:38,150 --> 01:59:42,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, and in the conversations you've had with the administration, did they clarify at all, no?

1510
01:59:43,634 --> 01:59:44,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Not yet, no.

1511
01:59:45,335 --> 01:59:45,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1512
01:59:47,377 --> 01:59:50,078
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight and Councilor Peers.

1513
01:59:50,138 --> 01:59:51,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions from the councilors?

1514
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:55,142
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Caraviello and then Councilor Marks.

1515
01:59:55,622 --> 01:59:58,464
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I'm understanding this, we are,

1516
02:00:01,945 --> 02:00:10,268
[SPEAKER_04]: would change this to suggest or recommend that the administration change this order, correct?

1517
02:00:12,808 --> 02:00:13,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1518
02:00:14,769 --> 02:00:22,591
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, and I think, Adam, I think, did you say that they were in favor of changing it or they had not made a decision?

1519
02:00:25,412 --> 02:00:29,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I was asking Councilor Caraviello whether or not they had taken a position on it.

1520
02:00:31,548 --> 02:00:34,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just- Talking to another city clerk.

1521
02:00:36,669 --> 02:00:37,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information.

1522
02:00:37,649 --> 02:00:40,130
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, Councilor Bears.

1523
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:44,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I brought it up last week and nothing has been changed.

1524
02:00:44,751 --> 02:00:46,051
[SPEAKER_02]: No order has been made to change it.

1525
02:00:46,151 --> 02:00:47,652
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where I am now.

1526
02:00:53,293 --> 02:00:54,613
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1527
02:00:54,653 --> 02:00:56,174
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Caraviello, are you all set?

1528
02:00:57,294 --> 02:00:57,734
[SPEAKER_04]: At the moment.

1529
02:00:58,614 --> 02:00:59,935
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you think it's gonna be a long meeting?

1530
02:01:00,295 --> 02:01:00,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Kelly Catello.

1531
02:01:02,241 --> 02:01:12,506
[SPEAKER_26]: So I guess my question is, since it's on the table here and you guys all might vote on it, do you have a problem with a homeowner that wants to allow us to show their home?

1532
02:01:12,566 --> 02:01:21,171
[SPEAKER_26]: So if they live in their home, and Zach, I get what you're getting, no tenant wants to feel like somebody is going to barge into their home and they're going to feel unsafe.

1533
02:01:21,611 --> 02:01:27,874
[SPEAKER_26]: However, if a homeowner puts their house on the market, is it okay for the homeowner to allow somebody in?

1534
02:01:27,894 --> 02:01:28,875
[SPEAKER_26]: Are you okay with that?

1535
02:01:33,493 --> 02:01:34,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

1536
02:01:35,514 --> 02:01:44,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, at this point in time, I think this is where we are beginning to tread into murky and dangerous waters where we're going to start delivering mixed messages.

1537
02:01:45,638 --> 02:01:52,541
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's important that the administration address this issue because the administration is really responsible for the enforcement of the executive order.

1538
02:01:52,581 --> 02:01:58,143
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the body of the government that has the tools and the responsibility to execute and implement.

1539
02:01:59,004 --> 02:02:01,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd be very cautious.

1540
02:02:03,227 --> 02:02:12,215
[SPEAKER_08]: going down this line of questioning if we're not all on the same page and have consistent answers because we're going to be giving mixed messages similar to what happened last week.

1541
02:02:12,855 --> 02:02:18,720
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to be very clear, Mr. President, that I think that we're treading down the wrong path at this point in time.

1542
02:02:18,740 --> 02:02:27,748
[SPEAKER_08]: And this might be a topic that needs to be clarified through the city administration very simply with a one-line response to the council, yes or no, it's allowed or it's not allowed.

1543
02:02:28,348 --> 02:02:33,349
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that that will nip this in the bud right now, but when Ms.

1544
02:02:33,369 --> 02:02:42,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Catalo, who's a local real estate agent who has a very successful business here in the community, asks the question, do you have a problem with this?

1545
02:02:42,211 --> 02:02:43,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a problem with that?

1546
02:02:43,172 --> 02:02:48,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that's going to start bringing us down the line of, well, I think this, I think that, he thinks this, she thinks this.

1547
02:02:49,393 --> 02:02:51,854
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a consistent message going forward, Mr. President.

1548
02:02:51,874 --> 02:02:56,115
[SPEAKER_08]: That message has to come through the administration through a clarification of their executive order.

1549
02:02:56,515 --> 02:02:56,935
[SPEAKER_18]: I would agree.

1550
02:02:59,059 --> 02:03:14,076
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mr. President, I would ask that this be offered in the form of a motion that the paper be forwarded to the administration for clarification on their executive order as to whether or not rental units are allowed to be shown when the units are unoccupied.

1551
02:03:16,098 --> 02:03:17,380
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1552
02:03:17,820 --> 02:03:20,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, housing units, not rental units, housing units.

1553
02:03:21,247 --> 02:03:22,427
[SPEAKER_02]: I would second that motion.

1554
02:03:22,448 --> 02:03:35,813
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, do you have the language that the council just... I know I talk fast as it is and on Zoom, it doesn't make it any easier.

1555
02:03:36,253 --> 02:03:38,874
[SPEAKER_17]: You are correct.

1556
02:03:38,894 --> 02:03:41,855
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you have the language that council and I just offered?

1557
02:03:42,416 --> 02:03:43,676
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have all of it, no.

1558
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:45,737
[SPEAKER_17]: If you could please phrase that again.

1559
02:03:47,127 --> 02:03:58,718
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion would be to refer the paper to the city administration for clarification on their executive order as to whether or not unoccupied housing units are able to be shown.

1560
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:01,780
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1561
02:04:09,747 --> 02:04:12,450
[SPEAKER_17]: So is that an amendment to the main resolution?

1562
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:15,381
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be a motion, Mr. President.

1563
02:04:15,521 --> 02:04:18,682
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion off on its own, okay.

1564
02:04:18,742 --> 02:04:19,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I second.

1565
02:04:19,663 --> 02:04:23,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor, you said something and I just missed it.

1566
02:04:23,464 --> 02:04:27,786
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a motion to refer the paper to the mayor and ask for clarification on that question.

1567
02:04:29,026 --> 02:04:30,267
[SPEAKER_17]: That's seconded by Councilor Bears.

1568
02:04:31,948 --> 02:04:33,208
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other comments from the council?

1569
02:04:36,029 --> 02:04:39,331
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, and Clerk Hurtubise, you have the language.

1570
02:04:40,071 --> 02:04:40,371
[SPEAKER_16]: I do.

1571
02:04:41,331 --> 02:04:42,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, can you read it back?

1572
02:04:43,830 --> 02:04:44,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1573
02:04:46,732 --> 02:04:57,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight is moving to forward the paper to the administration for clarification on the executive order as to whether unoccupied housing units can be shown during this crisis.

1574
02:04:58,738 --> 02:05:01,880
[SPEAKER_17]: On that motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Bears.

1575
02:05:03,281 --> 02:05:04,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Please call the roll.

1576
02:05:05,862 --> 02:05:06,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears?

1577
02:05:06,803 --> 02:05:07,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1578
02:05:08,644 --> 02:05:09,524
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caraviello?

1579
02:05:09,904 --> 02:05:10,104
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1580
02:05:10,665 --> 02:05:11,105
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Knight?

1581
02:05:15,861 --> 02:05:17,963
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Mr. President, Mr. Clerk rather.

1582
02:05:18,423 --> 02:05:18,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1583
02:05:18,763 --> 02:05:19,964
[SPEAKER_16]: Got some marks.

1584
02:05:20,865 --> 02:05:21,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1585
02:05:22,166 --> 02:05:22,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Council Morell.

1586
02:05:23,307 --> 02:05:24,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that's a scrub Kelly.

1587
02:05:27,269 --> 02:05:27,950
[SPEAKER_16]: President Falco.

1588
02:05:28,330 --> 02:05:38,918
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, any affirmative zero and the negative the motion passes to zero dash 30 to offer by consulate beer.

1589
02:05:40,059 --> 02:05:43,481
[SPEAKER_17]: You resolve that the medical committee, the mayor of border health.

1590
02:05:44,498 --> 02:05:56,329
[SPEAKER_17]: implement an emergency order to require that no landlord and or owner shall enforce eviction upon a resident of Medford residential or commercial during this public health crisis.

1591
02:05:56,690 --> 02:05:57,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears.

1592
02:05:58,171 --> 02:05:59,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you again, Mr. President.

1593
02:05:59,993 --> 02:06:05,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've included in the packet for councilors, the order that the city of Somerville put forward on this matter.

1594
02:06:06,379 --> 02:06:09,662
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, we sent a resolution supporting a statewide bill on this matter.

1595
02:06:10,570 --> 02:06:13,672
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there's also local action that we believe we can take.

1596
02:06:13,792 --> 02:06:20,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I've forwarded this to the administration, and I would appreciate if the council would support as well, asking the administration to implement such an order.

1597
02:06:20,056 --> 02:06:25,939
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it speaks also to Mr. Costa's point about, you know, our commercial as well.

1598
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:28,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1599
02:06:29,041 --> 02:06:30,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Any questions or comments from the council?

1600
02:06:33,183 --> 02:06:34,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed that whole thing, Mr. President.

1601
02:06:34,744 --> 02:06:35,364
[SPEAKER_08]: I fell offline.

1602
02:06:38,138 --> 02:06:40,879
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Peters, did you want to make a statement again on this?

1603
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:42,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I can repeat.

1604
02:06:42,759 --> 02:06:43,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try to repeat.

1605
02:06:43,519 --> 02:06:44,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'll get it verbatim.

1606
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:55,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So last week, we passed a resolution asking for the state to take action on eviction and foreclosure moratorium.

1607
02:06:55,881 --> 02:06:59,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I've included in the packet that there's local action we can take.

1608
02:07:00,122 --> 02:07:03,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Our neighbors in Somerville, their board of health and mayor issued a

1609
02:07:04,442 --> 02:07:08,423
[SPEAKER_02]: a local level residential and commercial eviction and foreclosure moratorium.

1610
02:07:08,763 --> 02:07:15,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I forwarded that to the mayor's office asking them to consider a similar order here.

1611
02:07:15,524 --> 02:07:22,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would ask that my fellow Councilors also join that we ask the mayor's office to consider such an order as well.

1612
02:07:25,846 --> 02:07:28,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1613
02:07:29,046 --> 02:07:32,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Hasn't the governor already issued something similar to this already?

1614
02:07:33,961 --> 02:07:46,890
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it I point of information I can answer uh, no, um It that's uh, why the legislature is planning to take action and also why somerville did that the governor's orders were more Well, we're not somerville.

1615
02:07:46,910 --> 02:08:02,882
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really care what somerville did So we're making so I think it's a smart thing for i'm just saying that they took an action They they found the uh approach that they can do under local law and I think that we should also do that see this is where the confusion comes from because we're

1616
02:08:04,170 --> 02:08:09,514
[SPEAKER_04]: that was sending too much information out on whether you can go, you can't go.

1617
02:08:10,014 --> 02:08:16,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the confusion comes in with we're passing too many resolutions on these things.

1618
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:18,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1619
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:19,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I hear you.

1620
02:08:19,741 --> 02:08:21,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a massive emergency.

1621
02:08:21,462 --> 02:08:22,803
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting a lot of people asking.

1622
02:08:22,923 --> 02:08:24,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard anybody being kicked out of anywhere yet.

1623
02:08:25,485 --> 02:08:28,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the couple that I did talk to was resolved.

1624
02:08:29,227 --> 02:08:29,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, again,

1625
02:08:30,521 --> 02:08:34,004
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're making a resolution for everything right now.

1626
02:08:35,286 --> 02:08:38,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, I think Mr. Costas just said that they're concerned about commercial as well.

1627
02:08:38,989 --> 02:08:40,991
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this is a crisis.

1628
02:08:43,053 --> 02:08:47,418
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think we're sending too many mixed messages here.

1629
02:08:48,999 --> 02:08:54,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, you're going back to 300 where this all needs to come out as one message.

1630
02:08:55,810 --> 02:08:58,791
[SPEAKER_04]: on this year.

1631
02:08:58,851 --> 02:09:08,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, let's say you get 300, 301, 302, and 303, and 304 are all saying the same thing in a different form.

1632
02:09:09,413 --> 02:09:11,233
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, this is where the confusion is coming in.

1633
02:09:13,493 --> 02:09:15,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week, the issue was that there was too much in one resolution.

1634
02:09:15,834 --> 02:09:18,194
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just trying to meet people where they are.

1635
02:09:18,314 --> 02:09:21,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're causing more confusion than anything else here.

1636
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:25,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1637
02:09:25,501 --> 02:09:26,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Marks.

1638
02:09:28,363 --> 02:09:29,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1639
02:09:30,004 --> 02:09:33,066
[SPEAKER_13]: This resolution is also open-ended as well.

1640
02:09:34,266 --> 02:09:38,429
[SPEAKER_13]: And who makes the determination when does this public health crisis end?

1641
02:09:39,469 --> 02:09:52,017
[SPEAKER_13]: Could I be sitting in my apartment a year and a half from now stating that I don't believe that this crisis has ended yet, at least for my family or me in particular, based on my employment, based on a number of things?

1642
02:09:53,198 --> 02:09:55,482
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a very slippery slope, Mr. President.

1643
02:09:55,542 --> 02:10:01,471
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate what Councilor Bears is trying to do, but this is a very slippery slope.

1644
02:10:02,292 --> 02:10:06,579
[SPEAKER_13]: I think as was mentioned by some of the other councilors, this could be misinterpreted.

1645
02:10:06,958 --> 02:10:12,542
[SPEAKER_13]: in many different ways, it's open-ended, and I don't believe it accomplishes what we're trying to accomplish.

1646
02:10:12,903 --> 02:10:28,375
[SPEAKER_13]: I think if maybe we set forth something saying that for the next 30 days, we would hope that landlords and so forth will not evict anyone, then that's something that maybe we can hang our hat on.

1647
02:10:28,735 --> 02:10:32,598
[SPEAKER_13]: But something open-ended, Mr. President, I cannot support here tonight.

1648
02:10:34,219 --> 02:10:35,080
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1649
02:10:37,226 --> 02:10:38,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilors have questions, any?

1650
02:10:40,507 --> 02:10:43,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1651
02:10:43,208 --> 02:10:44,809
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Council President.

1652
02:10:45,429 --> 02:10:46,509
[SPEAKER_15]: I applaud what you're trying to do.

1653
02:10:46,569 --> 02:10:49,470
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that, but I tend to agree with my fellow councilors.

1654
02:10:49,490 --> 02:10:52,531
[SPEAKER_15]: What you're putting, you know, as we keep going on 304, 305,

1655
02:10:55,950 --> 02:10:57,371
[SPEAKER_15]: it speaks to a lot of confusion.

1656
02:10:57,891 --> 02:11:06,914
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm versed in this and I still find it that, you know, you tend to on one, you could read it as contradicting another.

1657
02:11:07,014 --> 02:11:18,979
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's just something that I think I understand what you're trying to do, but I just think that right now the message is coming from the city and what we're trying to do with the state, it's getting convoluted.

1658
02:11:18,999 --> 02:11:20,140
[SPEAKER_15]: It's getting kind of mixed up here.

1659
02:11:20,180 --> 02:11:21,720
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think we should be careful.

1660
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:22,601
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we really should.

1661
02:11:23,281 --> 02:11:23,561
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1662
02:11:25,743 --> 02:11:34,049
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Mr. President, I'm taking a look and I'm just reading this article that the Councilor provided.

1663
02:11:35,017 --> 02:11:39,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and it just seems like there's a lot of the stuff that's on the agenda this evening.

1664
02:11:39,518 --> 02:11:42,319
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just mirrors what's in this article.

1665
02:11:42,359 --> 02:11:44,959
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost seems like, well, some of all did it, so it's a good idea.

1666
02:11:45,019 --> 02:11:45,979
[SPEAKER_08]: So we should do it here too.

1667
02:11:46,839 --> 02:11:49,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I don't necessarily think that cookie cutter approach works.

1668
02:11:49,580 --> 02:11:51,420
[SPEAKER_08]: That one size fits all approach does not work.

1669
02:11:52,060 --> 02:11:55,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, we are a different community that has different needs and different concerns.

1670
02:11:55,621 --> 02:12:03,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so in looking at this, um, you know, I understand what, what the council is trying to do and what direction he's trying to go in.

1671
02:12:04,423 --> 02:12:04,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

1672
02:12:05,023 --> 02:12:25,861
[SPEAKER_08]: But I also, again, feel as though the deliverance of mixed messages and the, you know, I don't want to say inundation, but certainly an extraordinary number of resolutions in the past two weeks relative to COVID-19 have been filed and it's creating confusion.

1673
02:12:35,196 --> 02:12:36,557
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I think we lost Councilor Knight.

1674
02:12:41,261 --> 02:12:42,822
[SPEAKER_17]: When we get him back, he can continue.

1675
02:12:43,663 --> 02:12:46,605
[SPEAKER_17]: But we have Councilor, Vice President.

1676
02:12:46,625 --> 02:12:47,646
[SPEAKER_17]: You back, Councilor Knight?

1677
02:12:49,087 --> 02:12:50,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm not saying that again.

1678
02:12:50,228 --> 02:12:52,590
[SPEAKER_17]: The last word was confusion.

1679
02:12:58,078 --> 02:12:58,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus.

1680
02:13:02,480 --> 02:13:12,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess Mr. President, the bottom line is Medford is that its own unique and individual community and mirroring what they're doing in neighboring communities just because

1681
02:13:14,532 --> 02:13:17,054
[SPEAKER_08]: It works there, doesn't necessarily mean it's going to work here.

1682
02:13:17,094 --> 02:13:23,179
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we're not going to be delivering a clear and concise message across all levels of government, then it raises concern.

1683
02:13:24,080 --> 02:13:32,246
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that we're in a position where we're almost somewhat overdoing it now when it comes to the coronavirus and the resolutions that are being filed.

1684
02:13:32,266 --> 02:13:34,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I think we really need to have a concise message.

1685
02:13:35,188 --> 02:13:50,210
[SPEAKER_08]: If we all want to get on the same page, I think that the appropriate course of action might be to sit down and meet with the administration, to meet with our Director of Civil Defense, our emergency management personnel, and figure out what's really going on with this situation here in our community.

1686
02:13:50,951 --> 02:13:52,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we've had that meeting yet.

1687
02:13:52,172 --> 02:14:03,261
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we've actually met with individuals from the administration and first responders to talk about where we are in Medford, whether or not we're flattening the curve, what we're supposed to expect over the next 14 days.

1688
02:14:03,321 --> 02:14:09,286
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't had that conversation yet, Mr. President, in terms of the public health emergency and what's happening here in our community.

1689
02:14:10,594 --> 02:14:13,637
[SPEAKER_08]: The public health emergency, I think, is the number one issue that we're facing.

1690
02:14:14,778 --> 02:14:17,040
[SPEAKER_08]: There are secondary issues that come along with that.

1691
02:14:17,501 --> 02:14:24,568
[SPEAKER_08]: But at this point in time, I think what we really need to be doing is looking at the impact that the COVID-19 coronavirus is having

1692
02:14:24,988 --> 02:14:32,910
[SPEAKER_08]: on our community in terms of the ability to deliver services, number one, and what to expect over the height of this over the next 14 days.

1693
02:14:32,950 --> 02:14:50,475
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to have a conversation with the director of the Board of Health, with the Civil Defense Department, with the administration to talk about these issues so that we have a better understanding as to what's going to happen here in Medford, and then we can take an approach that's going to work for Medford and not try to adopt what they're doing in other communities, because that cookie-cutter approach may not work here.

1694
02:14:51,756 --> 02:14:52,556
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilman.

1695
02:14:53,631 --> 02:14:54,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions from the Council?

1696
02:14:54,892 --> 02:14:57,113
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears, then Vice President Caraviello.

1697
02:14:58,654 --> 02:15:03,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I mean, I'm not, it's not a cookie cutter approach.

1698
02:15:03,518 --> 02:15:12,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying, you know, essentially, I don't disagree with you on the larger coronavirus question and then our plan and our discussions.

1699
02:15:12,944 --> 02:15:17,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree it's a massive public health emergency and an economic emergency and we need to address it.

1700
02:15:18,077 --> 02:15:24,161
[SPEAKER_02]: the intent of these resolutions and the ones I brought last week are to make sure that we are clear that we have a message on housing.

1701
02:15:24,301 --> 02:15:32,327
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the city's message on housing to work with the mayor's office on this, to make sure we have clarification of executive orders go out so that we don't have confusion.

1702
02:15:32,707 --> 02:15:33,888
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the intent of all of this.

1703
02:15:34,669 --> 02:15:39,552
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as Medford, you know, there's going to be a lot of impacts of this public health emergency.

1704
02:15:39,792 --> 02:15:42,254
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is going to be severe impacts on housing.

1705
02:15:42,274 --> 02:15:43,215
[SPEAKER_02]: We're already seeing that.

1706
02:15:43,737 --> 02:15:47,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've heard that housing and also real estate in general for commercial as well.

1707
02:15:47,600 --> 02:15:48,541
[SPEAKER_02]: We've heard that voiced.

1708
02:15:48,821 --> 02:16:05,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I proposed these resolutions, and I think we need to take action because housing is a local and a state issue, and it's going to present a big problem if in three weeks we don't have that clear message, we don't have a fact sheet, we don't have the information online, we haven't had the conversations.

1709
02:16:06,095 --> 02:16:08,197
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I put this forward.

1710
02:16:09,312 --> 02:16:11,193
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be happy if the mayor thought a different approach was fine.

1711
02:16:11,213 --> 02:16:13,355
[SPEAKER_02]: This is us saying we need to do something on this issue at the city level.

1712
02:16:37,274 --> 02:16:39,798
[SPEAKER_02]: to withdraw or send it to committee for more discussion.

1713
02:16:49,677 --> 02:16:59,904
[SPEAKER_15]: That subcommittee and talking about housing sustainability task force, guidance regarding housing resources, I think that does belong with everything that you're asking for.

1714
02:17:00,565 --> 02:17:03,587
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think maybe that might be the course that we go on.

1715
02:17:03,627 --> 02:17:06,649
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what, you know, these all fall into that.

1716
02:17:06,689 --> 02:17:07,630
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I agree with them.

1717
02:17:07,650 --> 02:17:14,795
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that that subcommittee can address all these to get a better defined message instead of boom, boom, boom, boom.

1718
02:17:14,855 --> 02:17:17,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I think that the separation of it

1719
02:17:17,877 --> 02:17:18,758
[SPEAKER_15]: is a little confusing.

1720
02:17:18,878 --> 02:17:20,118
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's my opinion.

1721
02:17:20,159 --> 02:17:20,779
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

1722
02:17:21,199 --> 02:17:28,223
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be happy to move to send this also either attach it to 20-300 and send it to that subcommittee separately.

1723
02:17:30,305 --> 02:17:31,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Knight.

1724
02:17:32,046 --> 02:17:33,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Second the motion, Mr. President.

1725
02:17:34,707 --> 02:17:41,932
[SPEAKER_17]: So Councilor Bears, are you making a motion to move this to the elderly and housing affairs?

1726
02:17:41,972 --> 02:17:42,032
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1727
02:17:44,575 --> 02:17:46,556
[SPEAKER_17]: That's been seconded by Councilor Knight.

1728
02:17:46,576 --> 02:17:49,718
[SPEAKER_17]: There are a few questions that a few people have their hands up.

1729
02:17:49,778 --> 02:17:55,562
[SPEAKER_17]: So I recognize Kelly Catalo, then Mima Sharma.

1730
02:17:56,002 --> 02:17:57,283
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, I hope we have that right.

1731
02:17:57,884 --> 02:17:59,004
[SPEAKER_17]: Amina Sharma.

1732
02:17:59,945 --> 02:18:01,446
[SPEAKER_17]: So let's go with Kelly Catalo first.

1733
02:18:02,732 --> 02:18:06,998
[SPEAKER_26]: So the eviction thing, the way that it's written, evictions are not easy.

1734
02:18:07,138 --> 02:18:12,385
[SPEAKER_26]: So to say nobody's going to be evicted if you mass murder somebody and somebody wants to evict you, you're gone.

1735
02:18:12,866 --> 02:18:17,513
[SPEAKER_26]: If you're dealing drugs out of the apartment, there's a two-year-old that lives downstairs, you should be gone.

1736
02:18:17,953 --> 02:18:20,195
[SPEAKER_26]: The House and the Senate are already dealing with this.

1737
02:18:20,255 --> 02:18:21,956
[SPEAKER_26]: The House bill is 4615.

1738
02:18:22,817 --> 02:18:25,118
[SPEAKER_26]: The Senate is bill 2621.

1739
02:18:25,559 --> 02:18:27,640
[SPEAKER_26]: And they are trying to come with a consensus.

1740
02:18:28,001 --> 02:18:35,586
[SPEAKER_26]: I think once this is already on the state level, we as a city need to back off and let our state legislatures do what they need to do.

1741
02:18:36,067 --> 02:18:40,130
[SPEAKER_26]: I do believe that your heart is in the right place, that we do need a housing task force.

1742
02:18:40,150 --> 02:18:41,211
[SPEAKER_26]: We want to protect people.

1743
02:18:41,631 --> 02:18:46,254
[SPEAKER_26]: But at the same instance, we don't want to do it at the financial, um,

1744
02:18:47,606 --> 02:18:49,947
[SPEAKER_26]: rhetoric of the property owner either.

1745
02:18:50,028 --> 02:18:58,153
[SPEAKER_26]: So the property owners aren't bad people, but they are the people that are paying you the taxes that you said in January that they wanted you to raise.

1746
02:18:58,193 --> 02:19:03,196
[SPEAKER_26]: They don't want you to raise them, but they're paying all your increased fees for everything else in the city.

1747
02:19:03,676 --> 02:19:08,259
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think at some point we need to back off as a city and let the state legislators do their job.

1748
02:19:08,279 --> 02:19:10,480
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1749
02:19:12,261 --> 02:19:12,781
[SPEAKER_17]: Mina Sham.

1750
02:19:12,982 --> 02:19:13,482
[SPEAKER_17]: Mina Sham.

1751
02:19:19,885 --> 02:19:23,468
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't tell you.

1752
02:19:23,628 --> 02:19:33,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Meena's trying to... Meena, we can't hear you that well.

1753
02:19:33,074 --> 02:19:33,374
[SPEAKER_14]: Meena?

1754
02:19:46,928 --> 02:19:49,349
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that better?

1755
02:19:49,790 --> 02:19:50,990
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that's better.

1756
02:20:25,863 --> 02:20:26,463
[SPEAKER_14]: Me neither.

1757
02:20:27,844 --> 02:20:28,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that better at all?

1758
02:20:29,625 --> 02:20:30,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

1759
02:20:30,226 --> 02:20:30,986
[SPEAKER_17]: Not really.

1760
02:20:31,006 --> 02:20:35,649
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you might need to type your question into the chat if you wouldn't mind.

1761
02:20:38,611 --> 02:20:38,971
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1762
02:21:04,295 --> 02:21:11,499
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, as an agent trying to navigate business in Somerville, Medford and Arlington, it's very unclear on how to proceed.

1763
02:21:11,519 --> 02:21:17,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Mr. President?

1764
02:21:24,508 --> 02:21:25,748
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Layton.

1765
02:21:29,890 --> 02:21:33,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I think, again, going back to.

1766
02:21:34,014 --> 02:21:36,095
[SPEAKER_14]: We can't hear you console night, you have the floor.

1767
02:21:49,958 --> 02:22:01,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, Mr. President, we want to deliver a consistent message, and that message has to come from the administration when it comes down to how to proceed and whether or not you're allowed to show units.

1768
02:22:01,627 --> 02:22:03,309
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why we're asking for clarification.

1769
02:22:03,429 --> 02:22:07,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the whole motion that's before this council and the whole paper that's before this council.

1770
02:22:08,212 --> 02:22:14,457
[SPEAKER_08]: The question is whether or not we want to ask the administration for clarification as to whether or not housing units that are vacant can be shown.

1771
02:22:14,898 --> 02:22:16,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's the paper that's before us.

1772
02:22:17,259 --> 02:22:19,061
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it can get any simpler than that.

1773
02:22:20,185 --> 02:22:28,960
[SPEAKER_17]: You are correct, and it's going to be going to a subcommittee as soon as we take a vote.

1774
02:22:29,220 --> 02:22:33,087
[SPEAKER_17]: There are a few people that want to make, actually have questions.

1775
02:22:37,795 --> 02:22:38,236
[SPEAKER_18]: Matt Hughes.

1776
02:22:38,836 --> 02:22:39,577
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, thank you.

1777
02:22:39,757 --> 02:22:40,799
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Matt Hughes.

1778
02:22:40,859 --> 02:22:43,902
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 76 Boston Avenue in Medford.

1779
02:22:44,343 --> 02:22:52,473
[SPEAKER_23]: And my question, I hear Mr. President, what a lot of the city councilors are saying about this

1780
02:22:55,782 --> 02:23:07,894
[SPEAKER_23]: this involving a number of mixed messages, issues being open-ended, and that this particular proposal may be read as contradicting another.

1781
02:23:07,914 --> 02:23:12,679
[SPEAKER_23]: I did want to ask, I think all of those are potential issues that could be

1782
02:23:14,200 --> 02:23:15,941
[SPEAKER_23]: address by proposing an amendment.

1783
02:23:16,842 --> 02:23:27,470
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that currently the effort of overdoing it, I also heard Councilor Knight mention that he thinks that we may be overdoing it now.

1784
02:23:27,530 --> 02:23:30,492
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we're actually dramatically underdoing it right now.

1785
02:23:31,133 --> 02:23:33,255
[SPEAKER_23]: And to get through as many

1786
02:23:36,777 --> 02:23:45,320
[SPEAKER_23]: As many policies as will benefit as many people as needed, we will actually need to be able to pass these things much more quickly.

1787
02:23:45,340 --> 02:23:57,064
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think the way forward right now is to collaborate on what the proposal that you want to pass as quickly as possible will look like and to pass it.

1788
02:23:58,805 --> 02:23:59,545
[SPEAKER_23]: So I would-

1789
02:24:04,689 --> 02:24:10,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe one of the frustrations that people always express with government is the slow pace that it moves.

1790
02:24:11,090 --> 02:24:17,972
[SPEAKER_08]: However, our forefathers had always thought that creating a process that was slow and deliberate and open and transparent was appropriate.

1791
02:24:18,032 --> 02:24:23,713
[SPEAKER_08]: So sometimes experience isn't necessarily the intended or best path.

1792
02:24:23,893 --> 02:24:26,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I can certainly understand where Mr. Hughes is coming from.

1793
02:24:26,554 --> 02:24:32,015
[SPEAKER_08]: However, just to put something out there as fast as we can just to get it out there so fast isn't necessarily the best path.

1794
02:24:33,055 --> 02:24:36,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Government is designed and structured to be slow for a reason.

1795
02:24:37,179 --> 02:24:45,747
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I can certainly appreciate his comments, but I did want to point out that, you know, everybody's very frustrated at the pace that government moves, but government moves slow for a reason.

1796
02:24:45,787 --> 02:24:49,050
[SPEAKER_08]: It was designed that way so that it can be open, transparent, and thorough.

1797
02:24:50,591 --> 02:24:51,973
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1798
02:24:52,193 --> 02:24:54,435
[SPEAKER_17]: Matt, do you have additional comments?

1799
02:24:56,199 --> 02:25:07,354
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, I did want to complete my question in asking, if we think that this may be contributing to confusion,

1800
02:25:11,698 --> 02:25:32,113
[SPEAKER_23]: Do we think, Mr. President, that an amendment could be proposed that instead focuses on what the difference is between this specific proposal and what is currently in whichever current rules are taking effect?

1801
02:25:34,365 --> 02:25:38,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that would be up to the sponsor of the resolution.

1802
02:25:38,468 --> 02:25:53,018
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, at this point, the consensus seems to be among the members that they should actually move to subcommittee where the subcommittee from what I'm hearing is running to him and the South ASAP.

1803
02:25:53,498 --> 02:26:02,584
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think the bottom line is from what I'm hearing from the members as well, and I would agree is we need to get some clear language from the administration as to

1804
02:26:04,035 --> 02:26:05,196
[SPEAKER_17]: really stand on this issue.

1805
02:26:06,276 --> 02:26:07,937
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears, you just had your hand up.

1806
02:26:07,957 --> 02:26:09,678
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure if you want to comment on this further.

1807
02:26:10,399 --> 02:26:20,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just that I am, you know, two things just very quickly, you know, we are in an emergency and in an emergency, government takes fast and quick action.

1808
02:26:21,025 --> 02:26:22,786
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually it happens through the executive.

1809
02:26:22,846 --> 02:26:28,369
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think as a legislative branch, we want to try to balance that as much as possible and be part of that process.

1810
02:26:28,409 --> 02:26:32,431
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want an emergency to mean that we are cut out of things.

1811
02:26:32,571 --> 02:26:33,652
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's just

1812
02:26:34,326 --> 02:26:37,328
[SPEAKER_02]: another treatise on government for this call.

1813
02:26:37,848 --> 02:26:44,273
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, just specifically, I think I had a motion on the floor to refer this to subcommittee and I would try to move.

1814
02:26:44,313 --> 02:26:46,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have a second as well from Councilor Knight.

1815
02:26:46,074 --> 02:26:47,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to move that.

1816
02:26:47,795 --> 02:26:54,039
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Bears to move this to subcommittee seconded by Councilor Knight.

1817
02:26:55,340 --> 02:26:56,501
[SPEAKER_17]: Please call the roll.

1818
02:26:57,942 --> 02:26:58,462
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears.

1819
02:26:59,064 --> 02:26:59,344
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1820
02:26:59,945 --> 02:27:00,125
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1821
02:27:00,165 --> 02:27:00,385
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1822
02:27:00,405 --> 02:27:00,585
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1823
02:27:00,605 --> 02:27:00,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1824
02:27:01,246 --> 02:27:01,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1825
02:27:16,220 --> 02:27:32,298
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a scarpelli clarification I can Mr. President with this, including all of the resolutions that Mr. Councilor Bears that has to do relevant to housing resolution for now we're in the middle of the roll call so just in this one.

1826
02:27:32,638 --> 02:27:32,839
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1827
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:34,741
[SPEAKER_16]: President Falco.

1828
02:27:35,181 --> 02:27:35,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1829
02:27:36,290 --> 02:27:38,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven the affirmative, zero the negative.

1830
02:27:38,893 --> 02:27:52,668
[SPEAKER_17]: The 20-302 will be going to the Subcommittee on Elderly and Housing Affairs, chaired by Councilor Bears with Councilor Marks and Councilor, Vice President Caraviello and his members.

1831
02:27:52,688 --> 02:27:55,371
[SPEAKER_17]: 20-303 offered by Councilor- Mr. President.

1832
02:27:55,761 --> 02:27:56,521
[SPEAKER_17]: Withdrawn, okay.

1833
02:27:56,781 --> 02:27:58,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bears withdraws 2-0-303.

1834
02:27:58,802 --> 02:28:04,525
[SPEAKER_17]: 2-0-304 offered by- I withdraw, Mr. President.

1835
02:28:04,665 --> 02:28:05,705
[SPEAKER_17]: That's withdrawn as well.

1836
02:28:05,745 --> 02:28:10,187
[SPEAKER_17]: So 2-0-304 has been withdrawn from Councilor Bears.

1837
02:28:10,207 --> 02:28:15,809
[SPEAKER_17]: 2-0-305 offered by Councilor Bears.

1838
02:28:16,270 --> 02:28:16,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Withdrawn.

1839
02:28:18,171 --> 02:28:19,111
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor withdraws 2-0-305.

1840
02:28:23,239 --> 02:28:34,515
[SPEAKER_17]: 20-306 offered by Council of Beers being resolved at the Medford City Council request that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts significantly increase the contribution to the COVID-19 rental assistance for families

1841
02:28:35,112 --> 02:28:42,698
[SPEAKER_17]: in transition, our AFT fund, to reflect the scope of the economic crisis caused by COVID-19.

1842
02:28:43,158 --> 02:28:50,563
[SPEAKER_17]: This can be done using funds from the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund and recent federal stimulus legislation.

1843
02:28:51,064 --> 02:28:52,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Bierce.

1844
02:28:52,925 --> 02:28:57,668
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, you know, this was part of the larger package of resolutions on housing.

1845
02:28:58,849 --> 02:29:02,572
[SPEAKER_02]: This would just be a request that there's been a temporary fund set up by the

1846
02:29:03,325 --> 02:29:14,150
[SPEAKER_02]: of Housing and Community Development at the state level to provide housing assistance for folks who are having difficulties, obviously, you know, with 40% of the population having already lost hours and wages.

1847
02:29:14,210 --> 02:29:15,070
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of people.

1848
02:29:16,091 --> 02:29:23,334
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to send this to subcommittee as well, but I think it's pretty self-explanatory just asking that an increased contribution be made.

1849
02:29:23,674 --> 02:29:28,396
[SPEAKER_02]: The initial contribution was only $5 million, and that's not going to be sufficient.

1850
02:29:29,757 --> 02:29:31,998
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to hear from other Councilors first.

1851
02:29:34,021 --> 02:29:35,062
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1852
02:29:35,202 --> 02:29:41,907
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any other Councilors that want to, Vice President Carmielo first, then Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Lee.

1853
02:29:42,448 --> 02:29:43,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1854
02:29:43,429 --> 02:29:49,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Mr. President, again, these are concerns that we should be sending over to our state delegation.

1855
02:29:51,975 --> 02:29:53,377
[SPEAKER_04]: We are the Medford City Council.

1856
02:29:53,417 --> 02:29:56,239
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not the state delegation in Medford.

1857
02:29:57,460 --> 02:30:00,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, not that it's not a good thing to do, but,

1858
02:30:04,597 --> 02:30:08,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're overdoing what we're doing here on this COVID-19.

1859
02:30:08,600 --> 02:30:12,182
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, let the state do their job on what they're supposed to do.

1860
02:30:14,304 --> 02:30:23,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, call up Representative Donato, call up Representative Gobley, call Representative Barber, call the Senator.

1861
02:30:24,391 --> 02:30:27,053
[SPEAKER_04]: These are things that they're supposed to be doing, not us.

1862
02:30:29,307 --> 02:30:38,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Our job is the two things, the residents of Medford, again, state representative jobs, state senators are supposed to be doing these things.

1863
02:30:39,331 --> 02:30:45,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Have the people call the state senators, state representatives and voice their support for this.

1864
02:30:46,514 --> 02:30:49,135
[SPEAKER_04]: All we're doing is sending more and more papers out.

1865
02:30:50,835 --> 02:30:55,077
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we had 10 things on the agenda tonight regarding COVID-19.

1866
02:30:57,751 --> 02:31:04,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're trying to send out a letter saying one thing, and we've got 10 things that none of us can agree on.

1867
02:31:06,597 --> 02:31:07,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information.

1868
02:31:07,378 --> 02:31:09,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Point of information, Councilor Bears.

1869
02:31:09,599 --> 02:31:12,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have spoken to members of the state delegation on this.

1870
02:31:13,362 --> 02:31:19,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a way for us to let people know that this fund exists, folks who might be watching the meeting.

1871
02:31:19,536 --> 02:31:25,779
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important for us as a body to say that the state action is in the interest of our residents here in Medford.

1872
02:31:25,799 --> 02:31:29,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't disagree that calling them up and talking to our state delegation is important.

1873
02:31:29,782 --> 02:31:32,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely agree with that.

1874
02:31:32,483 --> 02:31:38,746
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Kelly said, we need the state to take action, but that state action is going to affect us.

1875
02:31:38,886 --> 02:31:43,569
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we should at least be able to say that what we feel about state action.

1876
02:31:43,589 --> 02:31:46,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we probably would like more rental assistance for people who are in need.

1877
02:31:46,691 --> 02:31:48,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I'm getting emails and phone calls every day.

1878
02:31:49,750 --> 02:31:50,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

1879
02:31:50,150 --> 02:31:53,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, Kelly just commented, can't the new housing assistance group get that word out?

1880
02:31:53,553 --> 02:31:53,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1881
02:31:54,253 --> 02:31:56,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't exist yet.

1882
02:31:56,174 --> 02:31:57,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm using the vehicles that we have now.

1883
02:31:58,396 --> 02:31:59,637
[SPEAKER_02]: In a week, maybe we'll have new ones.

1884
02:32:01,118 --> 02:32:06,081
[SPEAKER_04]: There's too many things that were being sent out on this tonight.

1885
02:32:08,380 --> 02:32:09,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Vice President Caraviello.

1886
02:32:09,800 --> 02:32:10,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1887
02:32:12,041 --> 02:32:14,022
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, I thank Councilor Bears for bringing this forward.

1888
02:32:14,142 --> 02:32:18,003
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand what Councilor Caraviello is saying, but this is something that I agree with Councilor Bears.

1889
02:32:18,063 --> 02:32:21,304
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that there is something out there that we're just sending some support.

1890
02:32:21,804 --> 02:32:23,625
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't to the residents of the city of Medford.

1891
02:32:23,645 --> 02:32:31,687
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a delegation to say that we would support this and efforts for future, you know, with the additional crisis.

1892
02:32:32,107 --> 02:32:37,269
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to, if I can, Councilor President or Councilor Bears, although you withdrew, you are still going to

1893
02:32:38,089 --> 02:32:40,030
[SPEAKER_15]: present those questions during the subcommittee.

1894
02:32:40,050 --> 02:32:48,536
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to make sure that because I think they're important to think that clarifying it and making sure that it's it's in a better dialogue in that context.

1895
02:32:48,556 --> 02:32:49,076
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

1896
02:32:49,597 --> 02:32:50,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, if I can.

1897
02:32:52,498 --> 02:32:53,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yes, that's my plan.

1898
02:32:54,100 --> 02:33:06,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And after seeing this conversation, how it went, I think that we should have the discussion subcommittee and say these are all the state legislation we support do it as one thing if we want to do that at all, because that's what those last three Yeah, so so again, I'm we're working through this.

1899
02:33:07,567 --> 02:33:13,292
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm three months into being a Councilor and we're in a massive public health crisis and economic pandemic crisis.

1900
02:33:13,352 --> 02:33:20,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm just hearing concerns and trying to do whatever I can and work with everyone to get the message out there.

1901
02:33:22,098 --> 02:33:23,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1902
02:33:23,279 --> 02:33:25,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Scarpelli, are you all set?

1903
02:33:25,701 --> 02:33:26,302
[SPEAKER_02]: All set, thank you.

1904
02:33:28,263 --> 02:33:28,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

1905
02:33:30,285 --> 02:33:31,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1906
02:33:34,326 --> 02:33:47,709
[SPEAKER_08]: We're right now in a position economically where the city of Medford is not going to be afforded the same level of aid that we've received in the past, in my opinion.

1907
02:33:48,769 --> 02:33:54,731
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking at pretty much virtually every sector of our economy being shut down for a quarter.

1908
02:33:55,471 --> 02:34:03,793
[SPEAKER_08]: That's going to have a drastic impact on the amount of funds that are coming into the state coffers and that are going to trickle down into the city of Medford's coffers.

1909
02:34:04,713 --> 02:34:07,155
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly support increasing the subsidy for raft.

1910
02:34:07,195 --> 02:34:09,056
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no question about that, Mr. President.

1911
02:34:09,136 --> 02:34:17,282
[SPEAKER_08]: But one of the things that I think we really need to look along and hard at, if we're going to be asking our state delegation for money,

1912
02:34:18,610 --> 02:34:25,036
[SPEAKER_08]: in asking our state delegation where to invest money when we're going to come down to a situation where there's going to be a lot of belt tightening.

1913
02:34:25,477 --> 02:34:29,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what we really want to do, Mr. President, is beg for local aid.

1914
02:34:29,520 --> 02:34:30,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Beg for local aid.

1915
02:34:30,802 --> 02:34:32,844
[SPEAKER_08]: Say we want level-funded local aid.

1916
02:34:32,864 --> 02:34:35,846
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to see any 9C cuts to our local aid.

1917
02:34:36,687 --> 02:34:41,932
[SPEAKER_08]: We rely on our local aid, Mr. President, and without it, we're going to see drastic budget cuts.

1918
02:34:42,853 --> 02:34:59,768
[SPEAKER_08]: So in this economic pandemic, these uncertain fiscal times, the amount of financial obligations that the city has related to its debt service, I think it's very important that we balance the requests that we make from the state legislature for money

1919
02:35:00,769 --> 02:35:04,851
[SPEAKER_08]: are two issues that are going to actually inflate Medford's coffers.

1920
02:35:06,452 --> 02:35:16,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're going to be up against, quite frankly, a situation, Mr. President, where I don't see us getting a budget for the next fiscal year that's going to be anything better than level funded.

1921
02:35:17,838 --> 02:35:20,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see us getting a budget for the next fiscal year

1922
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:22,841
[SPEAKER_08]: that's going to fill vacant positions.

1923
02:35:22,901 --> 02:35:31,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I think those positions are going to be lost to attrition so that we can present a balanced budget based upon the economic uncertainties and the fiscal times that are facing us right now.

1924
02:35:32,647 --> 02:35:40,913
[SPEAKER_08]: So the only thing that I'd say is that, you know, as we continue to make requests from our delegation, that we really look long and hard at what we're asking for.

1925
02:35:40,933 --> 02:35:42,133
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to ask for too much.

1926
02:35:42,213 --> 02:35:44,615
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they always say you ask for two things and you get one.

1927
02:35:45,015 --> 02:35:47,216
[SPEAKER_08]: You ask for the loaf, and you get the loaf.

1928
02:35:47,236 --> 02:35:48,756
[SPEAKER_08]: You ask for two loaves, and you get one loaf.

1929
02:35:48,856 --> 02:35:58,858
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that if we're going to be asking the legislature to advocate for certain aspects of funding for our community, that it's funding that actually would inflate the city's coffers.

1930
02:35:59,659 --> 02:36:00,619
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my position on this.

1931
02:36:00,679 --> 02:36:03,039
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly support the resolution that the council made.

1932
02:36:03,059 --> 02:36:03,920
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a great idea.

1933
02:36:07,045 --> 02:36:09,348
[SPEAKER_08]: a meritorious effort.

1934
02:36:10,089 --> 02:36:12,331
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I will support the paper this evening.

1935
02:36:12,372 --> 02:36:21,322
[SPEAKER_08]: But going forward, Mr. President, as we make requests from our state legislature to fund initiatives and to fund programs, I think, quite frankly, the first place we've got to start is at home.

1936
02:36:21,382 --> 02:36:22,323
[SPEAKER_08]: Charity starts at home.

1937
02:36:22,604 --> 02:36:23,465
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to need the funds.

1938
02:36:23,505 --> 02:36:25,527
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to need the money going forward because these

1939
02:36:27,357 --> 02:36:29,201
[SPEAKER_08]: because of the economic downturn that we're seeing.

1940
02:36:29,422 --> 02:36:35,195
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not seeing the meals tax, we're not seeing the hotel tax, the city's not seeing the income tax.

1941
02:36:37,906 --> 02:36:40,628
[SPEAKER_08]: unprecedented amounts of people have been laid off from their jobs.

1942
02:36:40,648 --> 02:36:44,992
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're in a situation now, Mr. President, where the money's not gonna be coming into the coffers.

1943
02:36:45,032 --> 02:36:57,862
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we're gonna be asking the legislature for anything, it should be money to really inflate what we're doing here so that we can continue to provide at least the same level of services in the community.

1944
02:36:58,682 --> 02:36:59,503
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1945
02:36:59,703 --> 02:37:01,144
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Marks, did you have your hand up?

1946
02:37:01,965 --> 02:37:02,886
[SPEAKER_13]: I did, Mr. President.

1947
02:37:04,112 --> 02:37:08,676
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to clarify the RAF program has existed for many, many years.

1948
02:37:09,636 --> 02:37:13,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, this is not a COVID-19 RAF program.

1949
02:37:14,100 --> 02:37:19,744
[SPEAKER_13]: This is additional money that's being given to the RAF program because of what we're going through.

1950
02:37:19,764 --> 02:37:31,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and every time, uh, every year about this time, actually, this supplemental money that's put into the RAF program, along with the home-based program and many other programs that assist

1951
02:37:32,694 --> 02:37:39,240
[SPEAKER_13]: low income and residents that are maybe on the verge of losing their apartment.

1952
02:37:40,081 --> 02:37:44,645
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is the time of year, religiously, that additional supplemental money is given.

1953
02:37:45,125 --> 02:37:49,068
[SPEAKER_13]: So I appreciate the fact that Councilor Bears offered this.

1954
02:37:49,549 --> 02:37:57,676
[SPEAKER_13]: I can almost guarantee you that there will be additional money for raft, home base, and those other programs because of what's going on right now.

1955
02:37:58,376 --> 02:38:04,498
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't think us sending something to the state legislature in support of it would do any harm.

1956
02:38:05,638 --> 02:38:07,479
[SPEAKER_13]: And it can only do some good.

1957
02:38:07,859 --> 02:38:18,943
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would support this, Mr. President, in making sure, you know, this is the money that's, as Councilor Knight just alluded to, that's being sent to the most vulnerable.

1958
02:38:19,363 --> 02:38:26,105
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're someone that's living day to day in a time like we're going through now, one paycheck could mean losing your apartment.

1959
02:38:27,022 --> 02:38:37,328
[SPEAKER_13]: And so to many people, additional stimulus money, which I refer to as stimulus money, additional money for the RAF program may keep you in your apartment.

1960
02:38:37,788 --> 02:38:44,132
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're homeless, home base may be the additional money that you need to get you into your own permanent housing.

1961
02:38:44,532 --> 02:38:46,193
[SPEAKER_13]: So these are all important programs.

1962
02:38:46,814 --> 02:38:53,818
[SPEAKER_13]: And the state legislature, as Councilor Bears probably knows, they usually only fund at 60, 70% at the beginning of the year.

1963
02:38:54,258 --> 02:38:55,939
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's supplemental money that comes

1964
02:38:56,659 --> 02:38:57,560
[SPEAKER_13]: shortly after that.

1965
02:38:57,940 --> 02:38:59,181
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is what we're seeing now.

1966
02:38:59,761 --> 02:39:07,125
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will support this tonight because it's a good measure in keeping those most vulnerable in our population in their apartments.

1967
02:39:08,326 --> 02:39:09,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1968
02:39:09,987 --> 02:39:11,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Bears, did you have a comment?

1969
02:39:14,850 --> 02:39:15,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I was on mute.

1970
02:39:15,770 --> 02:39:16,591
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't usually do that.

1971
02:39:16,971 --> 02:39:24,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, um, I, Councilor Knight just got me thinking and whether it's a B paper, I'm not sure.

1972
02:39:24,876 --> 02:39:25,316
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um,

1973
02:39:26,572 --> 02:39:32,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be possible for the Intergovernmental Affairs Subcommittee to hold a meeting to talk about what Councilor Knight just talked about as well?

1974
02:39:32,837 --> 02:39:39,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I do think it's important that we understand the impact of what's going on at the state level on funding on the city.

1975
02:39:39,542 --> 02:39:42,965
[SPEAKER_17]: You mean from a budget perspective?

1976
02:39:43,625 --> 02:39:48,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just the local aid and all the stuff that Councilor Knight just more eloquently discussed.

1977
02:39:49,739 --> 02:40:01,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, that's, I mean, if you want to offer a resolution separate from this one to do that, or actually, you know, you might want to do is, it's either a B paper, if you want to put it in next week's agenda, that might be best.

1978
02:40:02,268 --> 02:40:05,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk to Councilor Nayton offline, and I'm going to step on his toes.

1979
02:40:05,771 --> 02:40:06,251
[SPEAKER_17]: That's good.

1980
02:40:06,832 --> 02:40:07,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think, my man?

1981
02:40:09,374 --> 02:40:13,356
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a number of people that have questions about this.

1982
02:40:17,259 --> 02:40:17,880
[SPEAKER_17]: Kelly Gattello.

1983
02:40:18,990 --> 02:40:36,559
[SPEAKER_26]: President Falco, so just for everybody's information, the city of Medford does have a page on the website which relates to everything that we've been talking about tonight with resources for tenants and homeowners relating to foreclosures, evictions, if they can't pay their rent.

1984
02:40:37,059 --> 02:40:41,662
[SPEAKER_26]: There are a ton of nonprofits out there that can help people

1985
02:40:42,382 --> 02:40:46,403
[SPEAKER_26]: We are just at the very beginning of this entire thing.

1986
02:40:46,423 --> 02:40:50,905
[SPEAKER_26]: But there's so many resources, and the city of Medford has actually compiled quite a bit of them.

1987
02:40:51,405 --> 02:40:53,005
[SPEAKER_26]: So maybe we can look at those.

1988
02:40:53,045 --> 02:40:55,366
[SPEAKER_26]: I love the idea of increasing the RAF funding.

1989
02:40:55,406 --> 02:40:56,347
[SPEAKER_26]: I think it's great.

1990
02:40:56,967 --> 02:41:00,808
[SPEAKER_26]: But we have a lot of other resources as well that I just want everybody to be aware of.

1991
02:41:01,868 --> 02:41:02,589
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

1992
02:41:04,229 --> 02:41:05,369
[SPEAKER_17]: Any other questions on this issue?

1993
02:41:08,210 --> 02:41:10,051
[SPEAKER_18]: Clerk Hurtubise, have you received any emails?

1994
02:41:15,720 --> 02:41:17,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I'm just checking, I have not.

1995
02:41:26,371 --> 02:41:32,477
[SPEAKER_17]: So the motion, so on the motion of council appears seconded by, was it seconded by council Marks?

1996
02:41:33,278 --> 02:41:33,579
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded.

1997
02:41:33,899 --> 02:41:34,700
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded.

1998
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:35,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, seconded by council Marks.

1999
02:41:36,662 --> 02:41:37,763

[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caraviello?

02:41:47,509 --> 02:41:47,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

2004
02:41:48,950 --> 02:41:49,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight?

2005
02:41:49,930 --> 02:41:50,230
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2006
02:41:50,750 --> 02:41:51,311
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks?

2007
02:41:52,251 --> 02:41:52,551
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2008
02:41:53,092 --> 02:41:53,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell?

2009
02:41:54,312 --> 02:41:54,553
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2010
02:41:55,013 --> 02:41:55,793
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2011
02:41:56,073 --> 02:41:56,333
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2012
02:41:56,714 --> 02:41:57,434
[SPEAKER_16]: President Falco?

2013
02:41:57,914 --> 02:41:58,154
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

2014
02:41:58,455 --> 02:42:00,656
[SPEAKER_17]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2015
02:42:03,506 --> 02:42:19,953
[SPEAKER_17]: 20-307 offered by Vice President Caraviello being resolved with the engineer looking to the contractor that did a waterline at 70 Auburn Street to replace the sidewalk with concrete and also replace the broken panel caused by the work that was done.

2016
02:42:21,494 --> 02:42:22,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice President Caraviello.

2017
02:42:22,915 --> 02:42:23,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2018
02:42:23,735 --> 02:42:29,998
[SPEAKER_04]: The street was recently redone with a new sidewalk and a new street.

2019
02:42:31,625 --> 02:42:41,182
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, during this good time when we're out there walking around, uh, I saw that a water line was put in there, um, with a, uh, hot top patch.

2020
02:42:41,743 --> 02:42:42,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how long it's been there.

2021
02:42:43,932 --> 02:42:45,834
[SPEAKER_04]: that broke up the brand new sidewalk.

2022
02:42:46,194 --> 02:42:50,837
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they put the water line in, they also broke the panel next to it.

2023
02:42:51,357 --> 02:43:02,865
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know who did the work on that, but if the engineer can find out who did it, so they can replace it with concrete and replace it, the panel beside it that was also broken.

2024
02:43:03,245 --> 02:43:04,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, these are brand new sidewalks.

2025
02:43:05,927 --> 02:43:07,848
[SPEAKER_04]: They're barely a year old.

2026
02:43:08,268 --> 02:43:12,231
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can get that done before it lingers on too long.

2027
02:43:13,795 --> 02:43:14,815
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

2028
02:43:14,835 --> 02:43:16,996
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by?

2029
02:43:17,016 --> 02:43:18,756
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded, Mr. President.

2030
02:43:20,557 --> 02:43:21,857
[SPEAKER_17]: Seconded by Councilor Knight?

2031
02:43:22,877 --> 02:43:23,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, sir.

2032
02:43:23,998 --> 02:43:25,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

2033
02:43:28,159 --> 02:43:28,699
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Bears?

2034
02:43:29,099 --> 02:43:29,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2035
02:43:30,279 --> 02:43:31,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Caraviello?

2036
02:43:31,420 --> 02:43:31,640
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2037
02:43:32,160 --> 02:43:32,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight?

2038
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:33,320
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2039
02:43:34,120 --> 02:43:34,680
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks?

2040
02:43:35,481 --> 02:43:35,781
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2041
02:43:36,381 --> 02:43:37,041
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell?

2042
02:43:37,561 --> 02:43:37,821
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2043
02:43:38,401 --> 02:43:39,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli?

2044
02:43:39,482 --> 02:43:39,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2045
02:43:40,142 --> 02:43:40,802
[SPEAKER_16]: President Falco?

2046
02:43:41,658 --> 02:43:44,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2047
02:43:44,479 --> 02:43:55,681
[SPEAKER_17]: 2-0-3-0-8 is offered by, it's a joint resolution offered by myself and Vice President Caraviello.

2048
02:43:56,161 --> 02:44:02,563
[SPEAKER_17]: If I could call on the senior member of Council of Marks to take the chair to read 2-0-3-0-8, please.

2049
02:44:04,383 --> 02:44:06,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Offered by President Falco and Vice President Caraviello.

2050
02:44:07,844 --> 02:44:10,565
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the administration update the city council

2051
02:44:11,391 --> 02:44:19,960
[SPEAKER_13]: as to when peer consultants will be hired and what type of peer consultants will be hired to assist the city of Medford through the 40B process.

2052
02:44:20,540 --> 02:44:21,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Council President.

2053
02:44:22,462 --> 02:44:23,683
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Larkin.

2054
02:44:23,703 --> 02:44:23,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2055
02:44:25,922 --> 02:44:31,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Back on March 11th, I went through the 40B training that was held at City Hall.

2056
02:44:31,206 --> 02:44:33,088
[SPEAKER_17]: I was there with Vice President Caraviello.

2057
02:44:33,108 --> 02:44:35,329
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Councilor Morell was there as well.

2058
02:44:36,010 --> 02:44:38,952
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was actually a pretty good training session.

2059
02:44:39,653 --> 02:44:42,675
[SPEAKER_17]: Judy Barrett was the person, I believe, that hosted the session.

2060
02:44:42,755 --> 02:44:46,898
[SPEAKER_17]: And she was very knowledgeable with 40Bs.

2061
02:44:47,259 --> 02:44:49,621
[SPEAKER_17]: She's pretty much an expert in it, but very knowledgeable.

2062
02:44:49,681 --> 02:44:51,602
[SPEAKER_17]: She had a significant amount of experience.

2063
02:44:52,183 --> 02:44:53,644
[SPEAKER_17]: She talked specifically about 40Bs.

2064
02:44:55,545 --> 02:45:04,615
[SPEAKER_17]: We have 340B developments coming into our community and this is something that we really need to get on top of as a community.

2065
02:45:04,715 --> 02:45:07,919
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we have a lot going on right now, of course, with COVID-19.

2066
02:45:10,415 --> 02:45:15,318
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure if it's a pandemic, but we really need to also jump on this as well.

2067
02:45:16,859 --> 02:45:22,923
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to find out, or actually the city can hire a peer team to help us out with regard to these developments.

2068
02:45:23,043 --> 02:45:39,333
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can hire architects, traffic engineers, civil engineers, 40B consultants that basically can help us through the process with regard to these developments that are experts in these areas that will really help the city and help safeguard

2069
02:45:40,507 --> 02:45:43,208
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, our best interest as a community and as a city.

2070
02:45:43,869 --> 02:46:00,334
[SPEAKER_17]: So simply stated, we just want to see, you know, when these peer consultants will be hired, what type of peer consultants will be hired, and if I could amend the resolution to see who is going to actually be in charge of the hiring process.

2071
02:46:00,515 --> 02:46:07,317
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it going to be the mayor, which I think it is, but if we could get some clarification from the administration on that, I'd greatly appreciate it.

2072
02:46:07,843 --> 02:46:08,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2073
02:46:18,087 --> 02:46:19,207
[SPEAKER_13]: Move for approval, Mr. President.

2074
02:46:19,868 --> 02:46:20,928
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Caraviello.

2075
02:46:21,568 --> 02:46:22,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2076
02:46:23,709 --> 02:46:25,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank the Council President for bringing this forward.

2077
02:46:25,910 --> 02:46:33,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there that night when we did the training, and it was a very informative session.

2078
02:46:34,454 --> 02:46:43,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we're talking about a lot of consultants that are going to be hired, and President Falco brought up some good points of who they are and who's going to be hiring them.

2079
02:46:44,478 --> 02:46:46,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, if we could also get

2080
02:46:47,119 --> 02:46:55,005
[SPEAKER_04]: a report back on to where the hiring of our zoning consultant is during this process also.

2081
02:46:56,286 --> 02:46:57,988
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can make that a B paper.

2082
02:47:00,710 --> 02:47:01,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Second the B paper.

2083
02:47:05,794 --> 02:47:13,920
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion offered by Council President John Falco and Council Vice President Rick Caraviello as amended by Councilor Caraviello.

2084
02:47:15,381 --> 02:47:16,082
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

2085
02:47:16,939 --> 02:47:20,121
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, roll call, roll call vote.

2086
02:47:20,181 --> 02:47:25,504

[SPEAKER_17]: One nine dash two eight seven.

2132
02:48:52,172 --> 02:48:56,835
[SPEAKER_17]: The whole meeting report Tuesday, February 25th, 2020 at 6 p.m.

2133
02:48:57,435 --> 02:49:04,480
[SPEAKER_17]: The purpose of the meeting was for the committee the whole to continue its discussion of hiring a zoning consultant, including an RFP RFP process.

2134
02:49:05,820 --> 02:49:06,461
[SPEAKER_17]: City Council's

2135
02:49:07,437 --> 02:49:09,958
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, with the city's chief procurement officer.

2136
02:49:09,978 --> 02:49:20,361
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a meeting, an interesting talk on basically how the process went with the RFP or actually how it didn't go.

2137
02:49:21,041 --> 02:49:26,803
[SPEAKER_17]: And the end result was basically that an RFQ is going to go out

2138
02:49:28,179 --> 02:49:31,800
[SPEAKER_17]: And we should actually, I think, be getting an update on that soon.

2139
02:49:32,661 --> 02:49:41,304
[SPEAKER_17]: But actually, as you heard just a second ago, Councilor Caraviello offered a resolution to get a further update on that.

2140
02:49:41,324 --> 02:49:48,367
[SPEAKER_17]: But that was basically, we basically decided that an RFQ process would go into effect.

2141
02:49:48,847 --> 02:49:49,348
[SPEAKER_17]: And Ms.

2142
02:49:49,388 --> 02:49:51,428
[SPEAKER_17]: Khan, Shab Khan has been working on that.

2143
02:49:51,889 --> 02:49:53,749
[SPEAKER_17]: So we should hopefully be getting an update soon.

2144
02:49:54,310 --> 02:49:57,451
[SPEAKER_17]: So on the motion of Vice President Caraviello

2145
02:49:58,623 --> 02:50:00,507
[SPEAKER_17]: to the committee report, seconded by?

2146
02:50:00,527 --> 02:50:01,709
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, John.

2147
02:50:02,130 --> 02:50:03,533
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Councilor Knight.

2148
02:50:04,850 --> 02:50:06,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2149
02:50:06,470 --> 02:50:16,752
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's very important to point out that when Mayor Lungo was on the council, she was an advocate for the hiring of a consultant.

2150
02:50:16,932 --> 02:50:26,854
[SPEAKER_08]: She was very outspoken about it, and I'm very happy to see that her administration is keeping that $40,000 commitment that the previous administration had made to this council.

2151
02:50:27,214 --> 02:50:33,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's very important, Mr. President, that the $40,000 commitment for a zoning consultant is carried over from the previous administration to this council.

2152
02:50:34,472 --> 02:50:34,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Correct.

2153
02:50:34,992 --> 02:50:39,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to point that out, that there is $40,000 of funds that are committed to this endeavor.

2154
02:50:40,654 --> 02:50:47,196
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also like to ask the question, Mr. President, this subcommittee meeting was sometime in late February.

2155
02:50:47,796 --> 02:50:53,097
[SPEAKER_08]: And at the time, we had asked for a list of all the consultants that had been hired since the change in administration.

2156
02:50:53,637 --> 02:50:56,518
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't believe the council has yet received that documentation.

2157
02:50:56,558 --> 02:51:02,440
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd just like to reiterate that request with the approval of this subcommittee report, Mr. President.

2158
02:51:02,460 --> 02:51:02,500
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

2159
02:51:03,608 --> 02:51:04,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2160
02:51:06,489 --> 02:51:09,190
[SPEAKER_08]: And offer that in the form of a motion to the administration.

2161
02:51:10,130 --> 02:51:11,651
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there an amendment to this then?

2162
02:51:11,911 --> 02:51:14,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I offer in the form of a motion to the administration for an update on that.

2163
02:51:15,652 --> 02:51:15,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2164
02:51:16,572 --> 02:51:22,174
[SPEAKER_17]: So we'll vote on the committee report first to approve the committee report.

2165
02:51:24,875 --> 02:51:27,476
[SPEAKER_17]: On the motion of Vice President Caraviello, does someone want to second this?

2166
02:51:27,996 --> 02:51:28,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

2167
02:51:28,756 --> 02:51:30,637

[SPEAKER_17]: Scott's like to do so you wanted to offer, but just to get an update on the.

2176
02:52:01,745 --> 02:52:01,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2177
02:52:02,365 --> 02:52:11,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mr. President, as part of that committee report, we did request from the administration a list of all of the consultants that had been hired since the change in administration.

2178
02:52:12,128 --> 02:52:17,209
[SPEAKER_08]: It was expressed by the chief of staff at that point in time that he would get that to us relatively speedy.

2179
02:52:17,869 --> 02:52:26,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I did bump into him shortly thereafter and that was the beginning of this coronavirus stuff So I just want to make sure that that's something that doesn't fall by the wayside.

2180
02:52:26,095 --> 02:52:26,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

2181

2200
02:53:23,062 --> 02:53:29,147

2201
02:53:29,428 --> 02:53:32,210
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we reviewed the three that came in during that time.

2202
02:53:32,330 --> 02:53:37,034
[SPEAKER_10]: And then Mr. Bravuso also provided some just ideas for future amendments

2203
02:53:37,825 --> 02:53:43,428
[SPEAKER_10]: to the sign ordinance that would help people compliant and really bring it up to date.

[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor, oh, Councilor Bears has a question.

2208
02:53:57,194 --> 02:54:05,698
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we didn't, the action was, I think it was to

2209
02:54:06,472 --> 02:54:08,413
[SPEAKER_10]: keep the papers in committee and then.

2210
02:54:10,294 --> 02:54:21,238
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe for Canada, I recall, I believe we asked Mr. Babuso to compile all the data and come back to us committee the whole meeting so we can all discuss the changes of the ordinance.

2211
02:54:21,338 --> 02:54:21,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Got it.

2212
02:54:21,938 --> 02:54:25,220

[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, you're correct.

2214

2223
02:55:08,116 --> 02:55:13,362
[SPEAKER_17]: Purpose of the meeting was for the committee of the whole to discuss the open meeting law and the rules of the council.

2224
02:55:13,382 --> 02:55:17,707
[SPEAKER_17]: The solicitor, we had a,

2225
02:55:20,477 --> 02:55:30,340
[SPEAKER_17]: discussion with the city solicitor with regard to the open meeting law or what things are allowed and what kind of resolutions can be offered under suspension and what cannot.

2226
02:55:30,940 --> 02:55:43,744
[SPEAKER_17]: It is pretty limited, so the advice given was basically just try to get everything onto the agenda because everything really needs to get on the agenda in advance before it can be taken up at a council meeting.

2227
02:55:49,072 --> 02:55:51,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Would anybody like to make a motion to approve the committee?
