[SPEAKER_17]: So the agenda for tonight, as approved by the committee on January 24th, 2022, the Rules and Policy Subcommittee will review the bullying prevention and intervention plan for recommended updates.

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,261
[SPEAKER_17]: I will take the roll call.

15
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:01,661
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham?

16
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:03,882
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.

17
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:05,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Member McLaughlin?

18
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:07,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.

19
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:09,723
[SPEAKER_17]: And Member Rousseau, present, three present.

20
00:02:09,843 --> 00:02:10,964
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a quorum.

21
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:14,445
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is a,

22
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:25,395
[SPEAKER_17]: The audience has had a chance to look at this document it's quite large, and it contains an awful lot of stuff that probably does not need to contain.

23
00:02:29,145 --> 00:02:30,066
[SPEAKER_17]: work going tonight.

24
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:50,126
[SPEAKER_17]: I had a receipt of a suggestion that if there was anybody here who wanted to speak on parts of this bullying prevention and intervention plan, if there's anything in it that you specifically think we need to focus on, I figure we would get that

25
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:55,470
[SPEAKER_17]: get your feedback to start rather than at the end.

26
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,412
[SPEAKER_17]: My guess is that we will need more than one meeting for this.

27
00:02:59,073 --> 00:03:00,694
[SPEAKER_17]: It's such a substantial document.

28
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:17,847
[SPEAKER_17]: And so without further ado, if anybody wants to raise their hand and provide any specifics about what you'd like us to be doing with this bullying prevention and intervention plan,

29
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:22,404
[SPEAKER_17]: Any particular weaknesses or strengths do you think we need to focus on?

30
00:03:23,384 --> 00:03:24,565
[SPEAKER_17]: That would certainly be helpful.

31
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:32,652
[SPEAKER_17]: And that includes the administration, obviously, school committee members, and any of the public as well.

32
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,554
[SPEAKER_17]: Member McLaughlin.

33
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:34,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

34
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,236
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make sure folks have the plan.

35
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:38,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Where can they locate it?

36
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:41,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I'll put it in the chat in a second.

37
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,720
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

38
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:48,105
[SPEAKER_06]: And everyone has access to the chat to be able to access the plan.

39
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,120
[SPEAKER_17]: You asked questions.

40
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me see.

41
00:03:53,401 --> 00:03:53,942
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure.

42
00:03:53,962 --> 00:03:57,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me just first grab the document and then I will see.

43
00:03:59,226 --> 00:03:59,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

44
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:03,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody who is a viewer will get the message as long as it's broadcast to all.

45
00:04:04,951 --> 00:04:05,551
Okay, great.

46
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:06,252
Thank you.

47
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:10,675
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is the Google document.

48
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:19,534
[SPEAKER_03]: It is available from our website under students and families.

49
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:25,718
[SPEAKER_17]: And in the dropdown, there's bullying, cyberbullying and internet safety.

50
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:29,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is the first link in that page that displays.

51
00:04:33,396 --> 00:04:54,079
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, Member Rousseau, just for the audience to know that this particular plan was approved in 2010, originally by the committee, and revised in August of 2014, and then just most recently revised in November of 2020.

52
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,261
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know that it's hard to be the first person to speak.

53
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:06,121
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, we got somebody.

54
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:08,442
[SPEAKER_17]: If you could just include your name and address.

55
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,203
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, your name and your address for the record.

56
00:05:14,123 --> 00:05:15,623
[SPEAKER_17]: Peter, do I have to click ask to unmute?

57
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:17,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I just did it.

58
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:18,544
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

59
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:19,064
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

60
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, it's Nicole Branley.

61
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:24,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't give my address.

62
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:28,306
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's saying I can't start my video because the host has disabled it.

63
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:29,227
[SPEAKER_08]: So just so you know.

64
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:30,807
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

65
00:05:31,172 --> 00:05:31,992
[SPEAKER_17]: Peter, welcome.

66
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:37,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Peter, is there something with the video that?

67
00:05:37,516 --> 00:05:38,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, I can do it right now.

68
00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:39,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

69
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:42,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to go.

70
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:45,980
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,203
[SPEAKER_17]: There we go.

72
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:53,525
[SPEAKER_17]: I like being able to see people.

73
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:53,825
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

74
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:55,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that.

75
00:05:55,768 --> 00:05:57,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, is it too bright, too dark?

76
00:05:57,448 --> 00:05:58,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't get on the laptop.

77
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:00,290
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're trying everything here.

78
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,251
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

79
00:06:02,731 --> 00:06:19,980
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to say that I've read this multiple times and I think the thing that really took my breath away about it is that it wasn't followed in my case for my daughter.

80
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I have never seen

81
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:27,042
[SPEAKER_08]: this bullying incident report form.

82
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:35,427
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think when I saw this, it kind of caught me off guard that I didn't even know that this existed.

83
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:40,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't think there's anybody on here that doesn't know our story at this point.

84
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:47,273
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that that was, you know, it took my breath away.

85
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:51,996
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know from the documentation that I have

86
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:58,676
[SPEAKER_08]: from the communications from the superintendent and from the principal that a bully investigation was never done.

87
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:16,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think everything that I've read in the actual plan is great, but we can have all the plans and all the rules and all the policies.

88
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:21,426
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think I've said this 8 million times, we can have all of these things,

89
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:25,615
[SPEAKER_08]: but if we're not following through, it all means nothing.

90
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:30,778
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, I've highlighted some things in here.

91
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:48,789
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to be the only one that talks the only time because, you know, you all deserve a voice, but we have fallen under many of the categories here that are the definition of bullying.

92
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,290
[SPEAKER_09]: And so,

93
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:59,572
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was very hard to see that there's actual paperwork that should have been done all along.

94
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:06,777
[SPEAKER_08]: We have incident reports, but that is being reactive in our situation.

95
00:08:07,837 --> 00:08:17,804
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe if some of this paperwork was done initially with some of our complaints, that maybe

96
00:08:19,062 --> 00:08:22,144
[SPEAKER_08]: we wouldn't be on our fourth police report at this time.

97
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:32,309
[SPEAKER_09]: So the plan is great, but it has to be done.

98
00:08:33,449 --> 00:08:46,716
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, in my case, and I think that I've probably been the most vocal person about everything that's happened to our child.

99
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:51,974
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are other people out there that I'm sure have had terrible things happen.

100
00:08:51,994 --> 00:08:57,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And where do they end up too?

101
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:59,217
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not just about me.

102
00:08:59,277 --> 00:09:00,618
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not just about my daughter.

103
00:09:01,658 --> 00:09:03,459
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a big picture.

104
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to make sure that that was stated.

105
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:13,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously, like always, I am more than willing to help.

106
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:24,245
[SPEAKER_08]: and do anything I can for the future of our city, for my daughter's future, for, you know, Medford means a lot to me.

107
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:25,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford High means a lot to me.

108
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:27,086
[SPEAKER_08]: My daughter means the most.

109
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:37,972
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I think it was just sad to see this form and know that it was never a plan.

110
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:40,313
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there was never an investigation.

111
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:44,575
[SPEAKER_08]: There was never a bullying form filled out until the day my daughter was attacked.

112
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,131
[SPEAKER_08]: the nurse wrote something out.

113
00:09:49,252 --> 00:09:52,033
[SPEAKER_08]: By then, we were already at the emergency room.

114
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:56,454
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to make sure that that is stated.

115
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,375
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sorry, my dog keeps barking, of course.

116
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:02,757
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just want to make sure that that's noted.

117
00:10:03,857 --> 00:10:04,738
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Nicole.

118
00:10:04,858 --> 00:10:10,900
[SPEAKER_17]: And certainly, once we get some opportunity for people to speak,

119
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:21,457
[SPEAKER_17]: The contents of the document, a lot of it surprised me as already being there.

120
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,621
[SPEAKER_17]: But I will let others speak.

121
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:27,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Member McLaughlin.

122
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:29,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

123
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:34,660
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to see the amount of people here tonight and folks that are able to speak up.

124
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,061
[SPEAKER_06]: It's appreciated.

125
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:38,903
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that there's some work to do in this area for sure.

126
00:10:38,923 --> 00:10:48,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is something that you know we've experienced personally in our family and over the years I've been supporting families that have experienced.

127
00:10:48,989 --> 00:10:49,770
[SPEAKER_06]: Similar scenarios.

128
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:55,593
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the documents a lot to digest, I will say that it's a lot for a family to sit down and read.

129
00:10:55,613 --> 00:11:02,576
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot for probably an educator or administrator, even though you know we know it's their job to also sit down and read.

130
00:11:03,216 --> 00:11:08,179
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, one of the off the top recommendations that I would have and I want to put out there is that

131
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:12,058
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, me, the visual learner, I talk about this a lot, right?

132
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:28,406
[SPEAKER_06]: Having a visual flow chart, you know, sort of image that is shared, what to do if, you know, if this, then that, what happens, what the process is and sort of a visual, you know, one page sort of chart that can help families and everybody understand what this process is and what happens.

133
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:31,107
[SPEAKER_06]: In middle school, we had a similar experience.

134
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:33,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not know anything about a bullying report form.

135
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:48,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Although we had gone to the principal at the time, just not a principal who's here with us any longer, but it was some time ago, but did not know anything about this, except for the fact that our CPAC, our Special Ed Parent Advisory Council, had a training on bullying.

136
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:59,741
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the time the special education director Kathy Medaglio came and helped give the training and that was when I learned that there was a bullying report form that was required to be filed in that training.

137
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:09,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was training for parents to be clear, professional training for parents to understand so that's the other thing I think really needs to happen in terms of I know this professional development.

138
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:17,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there's professional development that will be coming out as a result of recent events, but also as a result of this document.

139
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:24,580
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to ensure that there's also family training around this.

140
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:34,829
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was something that we had asked for specifically at the time as well, back in middle school, that there be some sort of, you know, they said there was an annual presentation in the auditorium

141
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:42,433
[SPEAKER_06]: or that they brought outside vendors in around this, but it was not really, you know, that I was aware of really fully understood or explained to parents.

142
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:49,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's something that should be happening regularly so that families can understand what their rights are and what the processes are.

143
00:12:49,157 --> 00:12:52,618
[SPEAKER_06]: So in summary, I would say one, a lot to digest.

144
00:12:52,899 --> 00:13:02,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, I really recommend a visual for also just for our families who have language barriers, a visual support and one that is translated to one page.

145
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:12,725
[SPEAKER_06]: visual support and one that's translated for our families, and three, that there be training offered for our families in addition to our professional development for staff.

146
00:13:12,985 --> 00:13:13,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

147
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:15,467
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

148
00:13:15,747 --> 00:13:16,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham?

149
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

150
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,133
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of things stood out to me.

151
00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:23,635
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally agree with

152
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:29,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Member McLaughlin, that this document is really undigestible in its current form.

153
00:13:29,646 --> 00:13:35,427
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, I don't know, it checks some boxes, but I don't think that's what we're here to do.

154
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:39,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanna make sure that we can get to a better place.

155
00:13:39,348 --> 00:13:45,669
[SPEAKER_04]: I think as I was doing a little bit of research, the school committee does not have a bullying policy.

156
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:54,031
[SPEAKER_04]: This plan is really supposed to be, I think, owned by the superintendent and the administration, which I am fine with.

157
00:13:54,531 --> 00:14:08,480
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think out of this work has to come an actual policy by the school committee that can then help inform the plan to implement the policy and execute the policy on a consistent basis.

158
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:22,009
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would tend to agree that this is one of those things like picking your health plan that you don't pay any attention to until you need it.

159
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:31,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And I use that example a lot because you can't predict if you're gonna need a chiropractor this year, if you've never needed a chiropractor before, right?

160
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,624
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you pick your plan.

161
00:14:34,346 --> 00:14:38,008
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't say, what kind of chiropractic coverage does this plan offer me?

162
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:40,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's just not even in your purview to understand.

163
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:46,112
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what happens then when the need arises, you have to educate yourself really quickly.

164
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:57,258
[SPEAKER_04]: And you are often like surprised and maybe disappointed at times, depending on what your choice was, about what you find as you try to educate yourself.

165
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:58,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think,

166
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:25,567
[SPEAKER_04]: when families find themselves in this position, some of the things that I have heard thematically are questions around consistency, are questions around I didn't know or who was supposed to tell me, so I think people really feel at a loss when this happens to them and they're trying to educate themselves quickly that there is a really quick and easy way

167
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:28,969
[SPEAKER_04]: to sort of get educated.

168
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:44,040
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as we think about sort of like bifurcating the policy from the plan and certainly the professional development that needs to happen, I think we also do need to think about what are those one-pagers.

169
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:51,165
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we have to get on a cadence of hosting regular forums about what bullying means.

170
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:54,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think the other thing that you hear happening in the community is,

171
00:15:55,328 --> 00:16:07,717
[SPEAKER_04]: that at each and every sort of altercation that you have that's unpleasant, everyone is making assessments about is or is that not bullying.

172
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:18,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we need to get to a place where we can educate the public with some consistency about what the definition of bullying really is.

173
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:34,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't think I don't think our residents are willfully ignorant, I think they want to know and I think it's really hard for them to figure this stuff out because they don't speak school and they don't come to school every day to be educators right so.

174
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:39,523
[SPEAKER_04]: we need to sort of help bridge the gap with families as we do that.

175
00:16:40,043 --> 00:16:49,011
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is like one of many topics where I think we could do more to help families feel educated and empowered.

176
00:16:49,511 --> 00:16:59,420
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think in this particular case, we need to find a way both in our policy and in our plan to insist on

177
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:09,951
[SPEAKER_04]: and require absolute consistency in how we handle these incidents when they come up.

178
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think that consistency is really important.

179
00:17:14,594 --> 00:17:24,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I think lack of consistency leads to all kinds of problems, including under-reporting, people looking the other way, people with the best of intentions.

180
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,763
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we have heard this in commentary here and there that,

181
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:31,080
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, reporting things doesn't really do anything.

182
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:47,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard that from students, and I want to make sure that on a very consistent basis, we can make sure that people know that we are, A, we have a policy, and B, that we are following it.

183
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:53,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully see that leads to better outcomes, right, because that's why we're doing this.

184
00:17:53,852 --> 00:18:07,336
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do think, you know, as we go through this work, we probably need to try to focus first on the school committee policies so that the administration can then do their work in terms of lining up the

185
00:18:10,312 --> 00:18:23,246
[SPEAKER_04]: The plan and the visuals and we probably need to work together on the parent education side of things, because I feel like that is a realm that is a little bit more squishy about, you know.

186
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:29,648
[SPEAKER_04]: whose responsibility it is, I think that's a collaborative effort would really make a lot of sense there.

187
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:34,530
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we're probably gonna have to take it one step at a time.

188
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:52,460
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think along the way, I wanna encourage people to speak and share their experience, but just ask people to be really cautious about disclosing specific student situations

189
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,280
[SPEAKER_04]: with us all.

190
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:55,481
[SPEAKER_04]: This is being recorded.

191
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to put that out there.

192
00:18:56,601 --> 00:19:07,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure that we're all sort of mindful that that is a really important thing for us to do as we do this work to try to protect all the kids in the mix too.

193
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:08,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

194
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:10,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

195
00:19:10,826 --> 00:19:11,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Downs.

196
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:23,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we just lose Mike?

197
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,741
[SPEAKER_03]: He went to unmute himself.

198
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:27,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you are.

199
00:19:27,581 --> 00:19:28,142
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry about that.

200
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:29,322
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry about that.

201
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:33,505
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, I've been an administrator when the bullying law first came out.

202
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:41,590
[SPEAKER_14]: And one of the things I'm going to piggyback what member Graham said is that people need to be a little educated on what's the difference between conflict and bullying.

203
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:54,318
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we can make that part of the training that you two members have now mentioned about with the community, that would be helpful because oftentimes there is a large disparity between a conflict and what actually constitutes bullying.

204
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:55,099
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you look at our

205
00:19:55,666 --> 00:20:04,353
[SPEAKER_14]: our bullying intervention plan, it does outline what bullying is, but maybe if we can add to whatever one page sheet or whatever it may be, what is conflict?

206
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:06,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Because a lot of the times it is conflict.

207
00:20:07,475 --> 00:20:09,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Kids are going to be in conflict from K through 12.

208
00:20:10,037 --> 00:20:15,841
[SPEAKER_14]: And sometimes, you know, we get, you know, we're the ones that do tease that difference out.

209
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,963
[SPEAKER_14]: But if people can be more aware of what that might be,

210
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:25,369
[SPEAKER_14]: And secondly, in some of the things that we cannot control, and I'll give you the biggest thing is anything anonymous online.

211
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:37,992
[SPEAKER_14]: We know when people come to us to solve this anonymous issue, we had a page on a social media website last year that we cannot find who it was, no matter what we do, because we're not tech people.

212
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:43,933
[SPEAKER_14]: I think education would help us a long ways because if we're bottled down with

213
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:50,535
[SPEAKER_14]: things that are simple conflict, you know, we won't want to take away from the actual cases of bullying because bullying is serious.

214
00:20:50,676 --> 00:20:53,418
[SPEAKER_14]: If it is actually bullying, it takes a long time.

215
00:20:53,858 --> 00:21:00,123
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we take a long time investigating every person who is there, every person who is mentioned as a potential witness.

216
00:21:00,663 --> 00:21:03,525
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, we want to be able to have that time to focus on those things.

217
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:04,706
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for your time.

218
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:05,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

219
00:21:07,468 --> 00:21:07,908
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

220
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:09,529
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham, is your hands just up?

221
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,070
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause it's still up.

222
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:12,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

223
00:21:12,763 --> 00:21:17,705
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I actually did just want to respond to something Mike said.

224
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:33,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a really good point that there is a difference between conflict and bullying and that we probably do need to start to create some language and some words from a consistency perspective around those two ideas.

225
00:21:34,452 --> 00:21:37,994
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the other thing we need to really be thinking about as we do that is

226
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:47,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a progression from conflict to bullying, and I think the answer is probably sometimes.

227
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:56,701
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the question that we are going to have to answer procedurally for the administration is how do we make sure that we are.

228
00:21:57,501 --> 00:22:05,786
[SPEAKER_04]: being proactive enough in conflict that we aren't allowing situations to like turn into bullying situations and issues.

229
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:13,652
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's sort of one thing that is really important for us to think about as we like explore this like educational space.

230
00:22:14,372 --> 00:22:23,358
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that that you said that sort of resonated with me is we take a long time to investigate these issues and

231
00:22:24,304 --> 00:22:38,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, again, from an education perspective, we need people to understand what those investigation steps are and what a reasonable timeline is to expect for these things to unfold.

232
00:22:38,954 --> 00:22:47,999
[SPEAKER_04]: And I fully expect everybody who has to actually execute those investigation steps to push back hard on the notion of like relative timelines.

233
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:50,741
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do think in the big scheme of

234
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:58,049
[SPEAKER_04]: How we sort of move the collective forward like we need to give people some some sort of like understanding of what that framework is.

235
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:10,004
[SPEAKER_04]: And, but I think also in the context of that i'm really interested in making sure that, while these investigations need to be thorough.

236
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:24,046
[SPEAKER_04]: they do need to be sort of as swift as they can possibly be so that there aren't like escalating issues going on while the investigation is happening.

237
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:37,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like for us at some point to talk about what are the like parent communication expectations when somebody is in like this process of an investigation and

238
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:54,857
[SPEAKER_04]: how can we make sure that the families as they are going through this feel supported even in the reality that they will probably

239
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:58,918
[SPEAKER_04]: never be satisfied with the information that we can share with them.

240
00:23:59,118 --> 00:24:17,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a reality but I don't think that precludes us from helping families feel supported along the way and I think we have to figure out how we do that and what the models are that again allow us to do that with consistency but those are the things that I

241
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:28,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking about as you were talking and I, but I could not agree with you more that this education space is super important.

242
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:40,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And even, you know, using this topic as a place to talk about curriculum, I think is a huge opportunity because I don't think

243
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,815
[SPEAKER_04]: know, parents don't know what the curriculum is.

244
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:50,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people go to curriculum night and they get like, you know, a very short spiel about a lot of topics.

245
00:24:50,583 --> 00:25:01,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And there, you know, there is and is going to continue to be changed, but curriculum around this and an approach that our school system takes when these things happen and

246
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:11,724
[SPEAKER_04]: how we are teaching kids conflict resolution that I think in this context would really help people like glue all those pieces together.

247
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:16,208
[SPEAKER_04]: That I think would be really beneficial.

248
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Member Graham.

249
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:26,517
[SPEAKER_03]: As anybody who does know me knows I have plenty I can say.

250
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:27,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Mr. Tucci.

251
00:25:29,673 --> 00:25:30,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, good evening, everyone.

252
00:25:30,393 --> 00:25:35,874
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to speak, if I could, to a little bit of proactive work that we do oftentimes with our students and staff.

253
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:53,178
[SPEAKER_12]: Over the course of the beginning of the school year, we are mandated in order to engage our staff members in a bullying training to make sure that they are fully in the know as to what constitutes bullying and steps they need to follow and are mandated to follow by law.

254
00:25:54,658 --> 00:26:04,321
[SPEAKER_12]: in order to report bullying and any concern of that to school administration so that we can conduct the investigation and go through all the steps that are needed to go through.

255
00:26:05,781 --> 00:26:23,326
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition, we are really proactive with regards to helping to engage our students and help them understand through some character education, bullying, prevention education, through the use of assembly, school assemblies, the use of our guidance, our wellness classes,

256
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:33,475
[SPEAKER_12]: the use of building a lot of this information in through other means to help students understand what bullying is and how they can go about reporting an issue to trusted adults.

257
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:50,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, a lot of our intentional work in social emotional learning and developing relationships with students in doing a lot of the restorative circles that we've begun to do to as well, certainly bode well in helping us get ahead and be proactive with regards to addressing these types of issues as they

258
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:52,791
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, kind of arise from that standpoint.

259
00:26:52,811 --> 00:27:03,496
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we like to be visible and out there and have the pulse of our student body, communicating, collaborating, and trying to prevent any type of issues like this taking place.

260
00:27:03,936 --> 00:27:18,224
[SPEAKER_12]: But of course, anytime there's an issue that, you know, does arise, we want to make sure that we're, you know, responsive, communicative with parents, and really collaborative in problem solving and following the process that we need to follow in order to maintain a really good environment.

261
00:27:19,582 --> 00:27:23,703
[SPEAKER_12]: One final thing I'll note is that, uh, I'm really encouraged by the work that we're about to do.

262
00:27:24,303 --> 00:27:37,786
[SPEAKER_12]: With the Sandy hook promise as, um, we're about to roll out, say something, which is another way that we can, uh, try to invite, you know, people to report and, uh, be, um, you know, not a bystander, but an upstander.

263
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:44,547
[SPEAKER_12]: If they see something or, uh, that they, that they perceive as being wrong, they can report it in these anonymous type of fashions.

264
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:47,448
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know that we're looking forward to rolling out this new program.

265
00:27:48,349 --> 00:27:50,534
[SPEAKER_12]: with our school communities in the next few weeks.

266
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:55,063
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want to chime in on that and certainly happy to answer any questions too as well.

267
00:27:55,263 --> 00:27:55,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

268
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:57,487
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

269
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Edward Vincent.

270
00:28:00,236 --> 00:28:01,977
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, good evening, everyone.

271
00:28:02,318 --> 00:28:11,164
[SPEAKER_11]: I also wanted to just piggyback on what was just being shared about some proactive measures at the lower grade levels.

272
00:28:11,745 --> 00:28:16,488
[SPEAKER_11]: We have students that participate during the first six weeks of school.

273
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:18,029
[SPEAKER_11]: We do the responsive classroom.

274
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:28,137
[SPEAKER_11]: And over the course of the year, we also have the Nexus classrooms, where during those sessions, the students learn about

275
00:28:29,978 --> 00:28:40,347
[SPEAKER_11]: the color coding for behavior controls and yellow and red and how are they feeling and green and blue and being able to identify how it is that they feel.

276
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:53,538
[SPEAKER_11]: And so some of those things, skills that are taught during those earlier grades, help the students come up with other strategies when they realize and they can identify their feelings in terms of

277
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:56,860
[SPEAKER_11]: If they're feeling happy if they're feeling sad.

278
00:28:58,001 --> 00:29:04,786
[SPEAKER_11]: So those are like the early building blocks, as you progress and move on to middle school.

279
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:09,730
[SPEAKER_11]: They have the what I need blocks, and I know a lot of.

280
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:23,863
[SPEAKER_11]: team building and circles restorative circles are some of the proactive measures that are used at the secondary levels 612 in different capacities.

281
00:29:24,524 --> 00:29:33,633
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just wanted to say some of the things that are done to help students be better regulated and I didn't know if that.

282
00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:54,207
[SPEAKER_11]: if any of the secondary or elementary administrators wanted to weigh in either on responsive classroom or nexus or restorative circles that help students become better regulated.

283
00:29:56,568 --> 00:29:56,928
[SPEAKER_07]: May I?

284
00:29:56,948 --> 00:29:57,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

285
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,431
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I don't know who said may I?

286
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:00,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

287
00:30:01,391 --> 00:30:02,472
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Member McLaughlin.

288
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:03,893
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, Member McLaughlin, yes.

289
00:30:04,212 --> 00:30:11,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, just as a committee member before we start dialogue with the specific other programming.

290
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:26,768
[SPEAKER_06]: I also just wanted to be clear and make sure that we point out that I know that Joan Bowen's not here tonight, understandably, but I also want to make very clear that students with disabilities have requirements in their IEPs.

291
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:35,832
[SPEAKER_06]: that they are given, you know, bullying information, that their families have bullying plans in place, and that the child has been educated regarding bullying.

292
00:30:35,892 --> 00:30:52,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's unclear how or when or in what ways those are followed, but there's very specific training for students with disabilities and with their families, and also, you know, training around manifestation hearings and whether an incident is related to

293
00:30:54,157 --> 00:30:59,140
[SPEAKER_06]: a disability or not, it's very important and very highly legislated.

294
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:10,787
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanna make sure that we're all really clear about that and that as we move forward, folks are provided that training or offered some training around that as well.

295
00:31:10,847 --> 00:31:12,488
[SPEAKER_06]: And I certainly have resources for that.

296
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:19,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Edward Vincent, if you're interested in them and I'm happy to share them with you offline, but just wanted to put that out there.

297
00:31:19,452 --> 00:31:19,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

298
00:31:20,553 --> 00:31:21,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

299
00:31:23,935 --> 00:31:24,675
[SPEAKER_11]: I did see Ms.

300
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:25,836
[SPEAKER_11]: Deimos raise her hand.

301
00:31:27,857 --> 00:31:27,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

302
00:31:27,977 --> 00:31:28,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Deimos.

303
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:30,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, thank you.

304
00:31:30,378 --> 00:31:34,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to piggyback on Maurice's comments about the elementary level.

305
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:41,262
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do think that we really do what she was referring to with the zones of regulation.

306
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:47,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Our guidance staff, our teachers and our nexus teacher really instill that at a young age.

307
00:31:47,692 --> 00:31:52,234
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that that's important so that students can feel safe and communicate their feelings.

308
00:31:53,174 --> 00:31:59,537
[SPEAKER_10]: We have initiated the morning meeting and responsive classroom with fidelity across the district.

309
00:31:59,637 --> 00:32:04,360
[SPEAKER_10]: So I feel comfortable that the students are building communities within their classrooms, that they feel safe.

310
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:10,103
[SPEAKER_10]: that now at six to 12, they're doing the meetings as well that I heard Nick speak to.

311
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:13,303
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think they'll have that consistency going forward.

312
00:32:13,703 --> 00:32:20,685
[SPEAKER_10]: But I definitely think that we had a learning curve last year with the nexus in the curriculum.

313
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:24,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really think this year we really are going strong at all four of the schools.

314
00:32:24,645 --> 00:32:33,967
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the students are really getting between Michigan model, zones of regulation and responsive classroom in that classroom setting that they're taking back into their homerooms

315
00:32:34,465 --> 00:32:36,865
[SPEAKER_10]: that I can't speak highly enough about that.

316
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:39,166
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's really just what I wanted to talk about.

317
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:40,206
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you for listening.

318
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:41,646
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

319
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:44,487
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham.

320
00:32:48,188 --> 00:33:01,971
[SPEAKER_04]: My kids are out of elementary school now, sadly, Miss Deimos, but Lucas was there in the inaugural year of Nexus.

321
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:03,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And

322
00:33:04,999 --> 00:33:17,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I pressed him for information many, many, many times and I was wildly unsuccessful in getting him to tell me anything other than his real feelings about going to Nexus class.

323
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:29,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it sounds particularly in tandem with everything else that's going on, like such a great,

324
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:34,628
[SPEAKER_04]: block of time and way to dedicate the space.

325
00:33:35,308 --> 00:33:50,439
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wonder if there is, again, some education for parents that helps them understand what happens in that class and how they might

326
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,001
[SPEAKER_04]: extract good conversations out of their kids about the class.

327
00:33:55,061 --> 00:34:00,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and maybe I just wasn't very good at it, but it was, I was unsuccessful for like an entire school year.

328
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:09,465
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I've heard that from other parents too, that they're like, we don't, I don't know what it is and I don't know how it works.

329
00:34:09,765 --> 00:34:15,447
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have, you know, there will always be a subset of parents that are like, tell me how to do it.

330
00:34:15,507 --> 00:34:17,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I struggle with this at home too.

331
00:34:17,907 --> 00:34:19,868
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just wondering if there's a way to

332
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:35,459
[SPEAKER_04]: When we think about education in this realm of bullying to be talking a little bit more about the nexus program and like why you all love it so much, and what they can expect to hear from their kids.

333
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,721
[SPEAKER_04]: and how they can expect to have a conversation.

334
00:34:38,881 --> 00:34:41,601
[SPEAKER_04]: How can they get engaged?

335
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:47,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And even better, where are those related resources for parents to meet their kids?

336
00:34:47,662 --> 00:34:56,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if my kid came home and said, I'm feeling orange today, I'm not sure I would know what to do with that other than to say, well, what do you mean by that?

337
00:34:57,164 --> 00:35:00,085
[SPEAKER_04]: But if there's language and capacity being built,

338
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:07,595
[SPEAKER_04]: in the schools, I think there are parents who might be interested in how that can help them at home.

339
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:09,538
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

340
00:35:09,558 --> 00:35:10,319
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Member Graham.

341
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Assistant Superintendent Galussi.

342
00:35:15,953 --> 00:35:16,453
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

343
00:35:17,895 --> 00:35:19,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for bringing that up.

344
00:35:20,257 --> 00:35:27,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham, I wanna just kind of like speak to a little bit about what you brought up, but I think it's really good feedback.

345
00:35:29,284 --> 00:35:43,156
[SPEAKER_15]: As many of you know on this call, coming out of the pandemic, Nexus was created by Stacey Shulman, Director of Guidance and Behavioral Health and myself, because we saw a gap in terms of social emotional need

346
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:51,839
[SPEAKER_15]: as well as executive functioning need, two things that students really lost during the ongoing pandemic.

347
00:35:52,479 --> 00:35:54,579
[SPEAKER_15]: So Nexus has definitely evolved.

348
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,740
[SPEAKER_15]: It's only year two.

349
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,141
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to kind of punctuate a little bit about what Ms.

350
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:04,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Demos said, because the group this year really works really closely together.

351
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:05,003
[SPEAKER_15]: They meet each week.

352
00:36:05,203 --> 00:36:07,944
[SPEAKER_15]: They meet with Stacey and I each month.

353
00:36:09,491 --> 00:36:15,614
[SPEAKER_15]: At the beginning of the year, they send out an informational greeting letter to all of the families.

354
00:36:16,795 --> 00:36:27,881
[SPEAKER_15]: It states the curriculum that they use, a little bit about the program, but I think that ongoing feedback of what you're talking about, we can easily build into regular communication at home.

355
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:35,145
[SPEAKER_15]: I do know that each time Nexus shifts their focus in terms of their lesson planning,

356
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:52,868
[SPEAKER_15]: They have been giving connectors to teachers so that teachers are aware of what's happening in nexus class and they have the additional extension for how they can bring it back into their classroom and kind of continue what's happening in nexus so there's a conversation.

357
00:36:53,548 --> 00:36:56,569
[SPEAKER_15]: constantly between the classroom teachers and the Nexus teachers.

358
00:36:57,349 --> 00:37:12,675
[SPEAKER_15]: But what we can do is really take those connectors and build them probably more into communication that can come home to families so that now parents can also have those conversations with students about what's going on at home.

359
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:18,617
[SPEAKER_15]: And I also wanted to mention this year, Nexus begin the year because

360
00:37:20,026 --> 00:37:23,828
[SPEAKER_15]: Stacey Schulman brought in the Sandy Hook start with hello.

361
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:29,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Nexus at the elementary level started with that as well at the beginning of the year.

362
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:34,294
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the whole beginning of the year was about friendship and start with hello.

363
00:37:34,674 --> 00:37:41,658
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that we can definitely work on building up the communication for the home piece.

364
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:43,559
[SPEAKER_15]: So I appreciate that.

365
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:43,959
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

366
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:45,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

367
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,300
[SPEAKER_17]: So

368
00:37:48,306 --> 00:38:01,075
[SPEAKER_17]: Unless there's somebody who urgently feels the need to speak now, I'm thinking we should probably try to move a little bit on to some more of the document and the policy stuff.

369
00:38:01,316 --> 00:38:03,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Does that sound okay to everybody?

370
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:06,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

371
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,324
[SPEAKER_17]: So I did want to also just add a couple of little things since I have a lot of thoughts on the document.

372
00:38:12,404 --> 00:38:14,665
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know,

373
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:19,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Once we've got some kind of a policy and a document.

374
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:29,518
[SPEAKER_17]: When I look at the current document, one thing sticks out when I look at other district documents, is that there's a, I get a sense that some of this was.

375
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:39,083
[SPEAKER_17]: actually written into, I mean, I have not looked at the law, but the consistency across districts makes me feel like there's perhaps stuff in there.

376
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:41,144
[SPEAKER_17]: We may be like, we need to cut all that out.

377
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:44,746
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it may turn out to be that it's just required to be in there.

378
00:38:44,806 --> 00:38:56,611
[SPEAKER_17]: So, but I think it's better if we just put that at the end, we'll send this off to our school attorney and he'll tell us that, no, you have to put this stuff back in because so,

379
00:38:59,578 --> 00:39:06,481
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's that stuff there about, you know, making sure that gets reviewed by our attorney to make sure we're complying with the bullying law.

380
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:18,845
[SPEAKER_17]: And then around the curriculum part, I am on the, the school committee had selected me to serve on the HECAT process, which is the Health Education Curriculum.

381
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:21,966
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the A?

382
00:39:23,286 --> 00:39:23,767
[SPEAKER_17]: Something tool.

383
00:39:25,509 --> 00:39:38,525
[SPEAKER_17]: For the entire health curriculum for the you know K to 12 and bullying is actually part of that process, and I have not looked that far ahead to that section.

384
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:39,306
[SPEAKER_17]: So,

385
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,813
[SPEAKER_17]: this will be getting quite a lot of attention, of course.

386
00:39:46,694 --> 00:39:54,360
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just didn't want anybody to think that when we get to the Michigan model listing of things in this document, that that's sort of like set in stone.

387
00:39:55,161 --> 00:40:00,445
[SPEAKER_17]: And I can't predict where the committee that's working on this will go.

388
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:07,050
[SPEAKER_17]: But my guess is that this will perhaps be part of the areas that we think we need an improvement.

389
00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:12,206
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to also quickly note that I have a few takeaways so far.

390
00:40:13,707 --> 00:40:23,591
[SPEAKER_17]: These are sort of things that I've heard, and that seems so obvious that they should end up as to dues, no matter what happens from here on.

391
00:40:24,935 --> 00:40:27,976
[SPEAKER_17]: translations of all of these documents don't seem to exist.

392
00:40:29,037 --> 00:40:33,099
[SPEAKER_17]: A visual flowchart, which I believe Dr. Cushing actually has one we can look at.

393
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:42,383
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know when that got created or where it is, but I did see it briefly today and I thought, yeah, that's a great idea.

394
00:40:42,543 --> 00:40:45,505
[SPEAKER_17]: And then definitions of conflict,

395
00:40:46,463 --> 00:40:48,144
[SPEAKER_17]: which are not in the document at all.

396
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:54,508
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are sort of the three that I mean, I have notes of what everybody said.

397
00:40:54,568 --> 00:40:55,529
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's certainly more.

398
00:40:56,629 --> 00:41:10,978
[SPEAKER_17]: But so I'm going to switch over to sharing my screen and really hoping that it isn't a situation where it's so tiny, nobody can see anything.

399
00:41:12,998 --> 00:41:15,539
[SPEAKER_17]: which is unfortunately happens a lot.

400
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:18,839
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a very large screen, 37 inches wide screen.

401
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:22,180
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have no sense of what you all will see.

402
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,320
[SPEAKER_17]: So please do tell me.

403
00:41:26,881 --> 00:41:28,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, thank you, Amber McLaughlin.

404
00:41:29,001 --> 00:41:30,602
[SPEAKER_17]: It was not new, it was created last year.

405
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:31,942
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, new last year.

406
00:41:32,342 --> 00:41:33,942
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, share.

407
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:37,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Am I missing the share button?

408
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:48,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Russo, just one quick thing, the flowchart, while it has been shared with members of the district, we do need to formally adopt that as part of the policy.

409
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:50,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, that sounds good.

410
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:54,246
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, there's the, I can never find share because it's the highlighted green button.

411
00:41:55,627 --> 00:41:56,568
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's see.

412
00:41:56,868 --> 00:41:57,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to here.

413
00:42:00,757 --> 00:42:01,037
[SPEAKER_03]: share.

414
00:42:01,918 --> 00:42:02,318
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

415
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:06,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to switch to a different tab.

416
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,981
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you see the other tabs?

417
00:42:08,821 --> 00:42:15,745
[SPEAKER_17]: When I switch, do you currently see a bullying prevention intervention file with MASC in the top left corner?

418
00:42:16,906 --> 00:42:17,226
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

419
00:42:18,107 --> 00:42:18,527
[SPEAKER_17]: Excellent.

420
00:42:18,607 --> 00:42:18,847
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

421
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:23,009
[SPEAKER_17]: So you do see all my tabs as I switch around, which is great.

422
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:27,432
[SPEAKER_17]: So I created a copy of this myself.

423
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:28,172
[SPEAKER_17]: And

424
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:34,201
[SPEAKER_17]: just sort of went at it with the proverbial pen.

425
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:42,186
[SPEAKER_17]: And at first, as I was reading it, I was like, oh, let's change this little bit here, this little bit here.

426
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:55,674
[SPEAKER_17]: And then as I kept going, I realized that it needed to be a bit more than a pen and more of like a, I don't know, I need to switch metaphors to find something more medical, but a big, huge chopping.

427
00:42:56,875 --> 00:43:00,958
[SPEAKER_17]: So this document, I don't know the source of this document.

428
00:43:01,658 --> 00:43:04,941
[SPEAKER_17]: Medford clearly did not sit down and just start typing.

429
00:43:06,101 --> 00:43:09,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Much of this is verbatim that you see in other districts.

430
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:23,814
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that tells you that perhaps the state or DESE or MASC, our professional association for school committees provided some sample and everybody just went and adopted it.

431
00:43:25,419 --> 00:43:29,701
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's these guidelines that start out.

432
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:36,664
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the things I noticed right off the bat is there's all this history information about where we've been.

433
00:43:37,224 --> 00:43:47,928
[SPEAKER_17]: And while I think maybe the Medford Historical Society cares, I don't think anybody reading this document to learn about our policies and procedures cares one bit.

434
00:43:48,689 --> 00:43:49,749
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Cushing, did you wanna speak?

435
00:43:51,227 --> 00:43:57,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so when this was first promulgated, there was a model plan and model forms issued by the state.

436
00:43:58,653 --> 00:44:06,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how much we have to strictly adhere to those as long as we're strictly adhering to the tenets of Mass General Law Chapter 37.

437
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:07,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry, Chapter 74, Section 37.

438
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so that will be like a critical thought.

439
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:21,844
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, and I'll get that reference from you later so I can type and do that too.

440
00:44:22,364 --> 00:44:28,450
[SPEAKER_17]: So, just as a sort of making this document usable, as Ms.

441
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:36,518
[SPEAKER_17]: Branley mentioned earlier, when I see really long documents,

442
00:44:37,392 --> 00:44:48,381
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel really like this incredible sorrow for the poor folks that are supposed to be following it because you presumably have to find the time to read the whole thing.

443
00:44:48,861 --> 00:44:50,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Then you have to remember the parts that matter.

444
00:44:51,323 --> 00:45:04,774
[SPEAKER_17]: This document is so long that I'm not gonna put anybody on the spot about whether every administrator and person who works in our school district read the entire 38 pages or whatever it is.

445
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:11,789
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think it would be kind of facetious to believe that, naive to believe that that really happened.

446
00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:16,450
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, getting this document way down in size is important.

447
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:19,011
[SPEAKER_17]: And it turns out that's gonna be pretty easy.

448
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:34,414
[SPEAKER_17]: If we get rid of all of the stuff that is the history of the document, that's chopping a bunch of stuff out, I'm gonna actually skip what all of this says, because here's the thing, it's repeated an entire second time.

449
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:43,204
[SPEAKER_17]: Right here, this is identical language, word for word, not like a little bit different, it's completely repeated.

450
00:45:44,725 --> 00:45:50,369
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's two and a half pages right off the top that just get cut out.

451
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:57,354
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think it makes sense for us as a group of 38 people to go word for word through this.

452
00:45:57,934 --> 00:46:05,519
[SPEAKER_17]: I think what makes sense is for, since I've gone through this, is to make some recommendations and we could take a vote that says, yes, Paul,

453
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:10,912
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, go through that as a sample and chop out all that stuff.

454
00:46:10,952 --> 00:46:17,436
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we can come back and look at it at another meeting to see what we have pared it down to.

455
00:46:17,497 --> 00:46:18,037
[SPEAKER_17]: Member McLaughlin.

456
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:20,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

457
00:46:21,443 --> 00:46:22,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate talking about the process.

458
00:46:23,264 --> 00:46:48,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for me, it would be really helpful to have a shared Google Doc that we're editing together, not necessarily during this meeting, but one that we can bring back to the next meeting as opposed to having just elements cut out all together and having a new document that we're working from, because I really want to make sure that it's collaborative, number one, and that we understand what is going and what isn't, because something that may look

459
00:46:50,802 --> 00:46:58,746
[SPEAKER_06]: non-essential to me or you might actually be extremely essential in terms of the law.

460
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:06,931
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I would recommend is that we have, this is, I love Google Docs, I think this is a great choice.

461
00:47:07,631 --> 00:47:14,796
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that we can be working on this document, as you know, simultaneously and also be keeping a record of

462
00:47:15,916 --> 00:47:27,023
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of the work that we're doing and the comments and what have you that we make as opposed to having one person do the bulk of the work and then coming back to the table with it.

463
00:47:27,103 --> 00:47:29,164
[SPEAKER_06]: So that would be my recommendation.

464
00:47:29,204 --> 00:47:32,186
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important that it's collaborative and that we really understand

465
00:47:33,081 --> 00:47:53,327
[SPEAKER_06]: the edits that you're proposing and being able to take time to absorb how that affects what's left in there and or whether or not there are some legal issues, as I said, because particularly with students with disabilities, there's a lot of legal matters that we have to make sure that we're abiding by.

466
00:47:53,347 --> 00:47:54,007
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

467
00:47:54,787 --> 00:47:55,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

468
00:47:55,187 --> 00:47:56,068
[SPEAKER_17]: I completely agree.

469
00:47:56,088 --> 00:47:56,468
[SPEAKER_17]: I will

470
00:47:58,837 --> 00:48:05,700
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll reach out to our attorney, but my understanding of meeting law is we could certainly do that, but we've got to be doing that in a public session.

471
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:12,443
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can't be making edits and you making edits and all of us making edits when we're not in public session.

472
00:48:13,063 --> 00:48:21,007
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't have any problem sharing this, but the only time any of us should be editing it is when we're on TV.

473
00:48:21,989 --> 00:48:30,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, sorry, to be clear, I think what I'm not suggesting that we're editing it simultaneously, unless that's what Howard is saying we need to do.

474
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:38,107
[SPEAKER_06]: Howard is our attorney, the school committee's attorney, attorney Greenspan, is suggesting that we need to do that.

475
00:48:38,307 --> 00:48:42,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying that we would, independent of each other, look at

476
00:48:43,482 --> 00:48:55,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the work that you're sharing here and be able to have our own input that potentially we could share at the next meeting so that we're not just cutting things today and not having a reference as to what was cut and why and where.

477
00:48:55,426 --> 00:49:02,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important to have documents that we can follow back the thread of thought in terms of what was being done.

478
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:09,011
[SPEAKER_06]: But I agree, I think it's worth asking Attorney Greenspan about what the open meeting law requirements are.

479
00:49:10,043 --> 00:49:30,487
[SPEAKER_06]: main purpose for speaking up with this is that I'm not comfortable just taking out big chunks of material without knowing and taking time to look at the document as a whole to see how or whether it affects other bits of material, particularly in terms of legal.

480
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:38,989
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm not really clear on what the process would be to do that because it's a 38 page document, but we should consider that.

481
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:46,681
[SPEAKER_17]: Certainly, I'll reach out to Howard and find out how this can be done technically where we don't.

482
00:49:48,862 --> 00:50:04,909
[SPEAKER_17]: My gut tells me he's going to be like, create your own versions of the document and do all you want to them and come together and make the document into one, which, you know, from a simple like process perspective, as messy as can be, the process that you propose is without a doubt

483
00:50:06,192 --> 00:50:09,433
[SPEAKER_17]: the easiest and cleanest and most efficient.

484
00:50:10,033 --> 00:50:14,855
[SPEAKER_17]: But as we are painfully aware of meeting lab doesn't give a hoot about any of that.

485
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:28,119
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Delay that I'm just curious, as you would know more than I but would it make more sense to just continue commenting, like not editing the document but allowing us to

486
00:50:29,909 --> 00:50:45,053
[SPEAKER_13]: like piggybacking off your comments, Paul, that you have already put in there, stating like, oh, this is law, we kind of can't move this, or, so it's not that you're physically editing, but we can come up with a final document based off of those comments.

487
00:50:45,554 --> 00:50:46,814
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if that makes sense.

488
00:50:48,034 --> 00:50:56,196
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that that would be fine if this document was posted on the Medford Public Schools website and the entire public could sit and monitor it at any moment in time.

489
00:50:56,256 --> 00:50:57,937
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that would probably pass muster.

490
00:50:59,105 --> 00:51:11,075
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, this is policy, we're talking about stuff within our authority so the public is supposed to have access to our thoughts and conversation like my comments here.

491
00:51:12,437 --> 00:51:17,481
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, member Graham remember McLaughlin looking at my comments responding to them.

492
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:25,217
[SPEAKER_17]: is more than one of us and only two takes to be a quorum of the subcommittee.

493
00:51:25,297 --> 00:51:33,439
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do not expect that he's gonna tell us we can do this on the other way other than everybody go create your own document.

494
00:51:33,479 --> 00:51:43,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Now to be clear, literally everybody other than the three school committee members could share a document and do this as member McLaughlin recommended.

495
00:51:43,443 --> 00:51:46,464
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we would all agree is the most efficient option.

496
00:51:47,388 --> 00:51:49,689
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the school committee members are the problem.

497
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Member Graham.

498
00:51:54,872 --> 00:51:55,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

499
00:51:55,892 --> 00:52:02,015
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would be interested in what our attorney has to say.

500
00:52:02,095 --> 00:52:13,961
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also would assume that the superintendent is going to want to coordinate her team's input on this in a cohesive way.

501
00:52:14,061 --> 00:52:15,302
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would,

502
00:52:16,385 --> 00:52:29,227
[SPEAKER_04]: think, although you can, you know, disagree, Superintendent, that you would not want 15 administrators in this document making live changes necessarily.

503
00:52:30,668 --> 00:52:36,909
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, you may want to think about how you want to sort of engage with this process.

504
00:52:37,649 --> 00:52:43,850
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the other thing that ultimately maybe becomes a little bit different is

505
00:52:44,608 --> 00:53:11,498
[SPEAKER_04]: if this really does become two documents, a policy and a plan to support that policy, if that is where we head, and I think it is where we should go, the policy is certainly a document that the school committee and how we proceed through it is really, really important according to the open meeting law, but the superintendent like building out the plan to demonstrate that

506
00:53:14,128 --> 00:53:20,171
[SPEAKER_04]: she and her team are implementing the policy is not subject to the open meeting law as it is created.

507
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:23,413
[SPEAKER_04]: And that work down the line may be different.

508
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:39,202
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think from a process standpoint, I am wondering if it makes sense first for us to maybe put this aside for a minute and think about the draft

509
00:53:40,336 --> 00:53:44,519
[SPEAKER_04]: of a policy that obviously probably has some like components in it.

510
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:52,425
[SPEAKER_04]: But do we first start with a policy like this?

511
00:53:53,506 --> 00:54:00,932
[SPEAKER_04]: And so do we start with something like this and we like work through this to the point where we feel like from a policy standpoint, it makes sense.

512
00:54:01,092 --> 00:54:06,376
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next step being we turn our attention to the plan from there.

513
00:54:07,717 --> 00:54:09,238
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Member Graham.

514
00:54:09,298 --> 00:54:10,039
[SPEAKER_17]: I do know that the

515
00:54:10,953 --> 00:54:21,879
[SPEAKER_17]: the bullying prevention and intervention plan within the language has an every five years we have to approve it as a committee.

516
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:31,844
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it feels a bit like it's this weird thing in the middle where we think of policies as ours and the superintendent can go and do whatever she wants.

517
00:54:32,685 --> 00:54:36,627
[SPEAKER_17]: And we think the word plan, typically that's her stuff, that's implementation.

518
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:38,588
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's interesting that the word plan is in here

519
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:47,072
[SPEAKER_17]: that's not typically our domain, but then the law explicitly says we have to reapprove it every five years.

520
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:51,793
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's kind of like somebody didn't, from MASC didn't talk to the folks writing the law.

521
00:54:52,773 --> 00:55:07,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So- And I guess it's my take that the superintendent can't update the plan until there is a policy for her to make sure she is tacking to as she does that.

522
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:10,051
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, we don't have a plan right now.

523
00:55:10,111 --> 00:55:15,716
[SPEAKER_17]: If we look at this plan number, this is, I forgot what school this is, Lexington.

524
00:55:16,877 --> 00:55:17,817
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, they have this.

525
00:55:18,758 --> 00:55:28,446
[SPEAKER_17]: Ours is sort of, so the way, as the members know, but for the public, we write policies, but if we don't write a policy,

526
00:55:29,195 --> 00:55:34,219
[SPEAKER_17]: the default is that the superintendent essentially writes the policy as she sees fit.

527
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:47,851
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's only when we write a policy that not to override her or anything, but just simply that when we haven't done our jobs to create a policy, it's not like she doesn't functionally have the ability to operate the schools.

528
00:55:48,391 --> 00:55:51,954
[SPEAKER_17]: So that is just defaults to being that the superintendent

529
00:55:53,928 --> 00:55:58,114
[SPEAKER_17]: is the policy maker in the absence of us making policy.

530
00:55:59,576 --> 00:56:03,281
[SPEAKER_17]: So, the member Graham member of my classroom sorry.

531
00:56:04,263 --> 00:56:08,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you know I was just, that was hard, a little bit for I think

532
00:56:09,602 --> 00:56:28,122
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds a little hard to understand maybe for the layperson, I guess, you know, I would concur with member Graham around maybe setting aside the plan, which is the 38 page document that folks are looking at this is what's been in place in Medford and is the currently published plan.

533
00:56:29,222 --> 00:56:38,167
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be created by the superintendent and her team, essentially, and if I understand correctly, the school committee has to approve the plan.

534
00:56:38,987 --> 00:56:42,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Every five years but I mean we certainly can have input into it.

535
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:47,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we create it, but we can have policy attached to, you know,

536
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:52,892
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the procedural stuff, when does the plan occur, some of the stuff of definition, what is the plan, that sort of thing.

537
00:56:52,932 --> 00:56:57,293
[SPEAKER_06]: And looking towards other systems that have created this, I think are good examples.

538
00:56:57,373 --> 00:56:59,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I know DESE has a ton of guidance on this.

539
00:57:00,353 --> 00:57:01,854
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's lots of other things that we could do.

540
00:57:01,914 --> 00:57:08,295
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would agree that we should, as the rules, policy and equity subcommittee, we should really be focusing on policy first.

541
00:57:09,155 --> 00:57:15,216
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's great to have the document of the plan and know that we have that as we are reviewing it and looking at it

542
00:57:15,856 --> 00:57:25,362
[SPEAKER_06]: as the superintendent and her team will clearly need to work on the revision of it and also have it vetted through obviously attorneys and all the things that we need to do.

543
00:57:25,662 --> 00:57:29,185
[SPEAKER_06]: We can offer advice like we think it needs an org chart.

544
00:57:29,505 --> 00:57:30,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, not an org chart, a flow chart.

545
00:57:31,526 --> 00:57:35,529
[SPEAKER_06]: We think it needs, you know, translation, you know, those sorts of things that we think.

546
00:57:35,629 --> 00:57:43,533
[SPEAKER_06]: But to be clear, you know, for folks who are on here, some folks know, some folks don't, you know, the school committee's role is to

547
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:54,857
[SPEAKER_06]: to hire and supervise the, sorry, hire and evaluate the superintendent, approve and plan the budget, and set policy.

548
00:57:55,178 --> 00:57:59,561
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are our three specific, you know, tasks that we're given.

549
00:57:59,581 --> 00:58:08,148
[SPEAKER_06]: And we, you know, do get a lot of training at the MASC around, you know, we had our recent conference, the MASC and MASS combined conference, but we get a lot of training around what

550
00:58:08,769 --> 00:58:22,050
[SPEAKER_06]: We can and cannot do and how you know we should not get in the weeds too much with administration and team so that you know folks can run but that we also have obviously our authority around approving material and.

551
00:58:23,943 --> 00:58:26,185
[SPEAKER_06]: and policy specifically.

552
00:58:26,525 --> 00:58:31,088
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that there is a little bit of, we're in the weeds a little bit with what's what here.

553
00:58:31,148 --> 00:58:37,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would agree with member Graham that if we could focus on policy first, I think that would be helpful.

554
00:58:38,072 --> 00:58:41,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that the plan obviously informs some of the policy.

555
00:58:41,815 --> 00:58:49,500
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is a little bit tricky, especially around some of the definitions, but I think it would be great if we could start maybe talking about what we think policy should look like.

556
00:58:53,066 --> 00:58:53,372
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

557
00:58:54,645 --> 00:58:55,145
[SPEAKER_16]: Dr. Edward Vincent.

558
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:55,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

559
00:58:56,226 --> 00:59:05,831
[SPEAKER_11]: And so where we have so many administrators on the call, Member Russo, I wasn't able to really see some of the comments that you made.

560
00:59:05,931 --> 00:59:15,216
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you're able to share your document with me, I definitely will be able to work with the administrators to have us look at where there is redundancy.

561
00:59:15,936 --> 00:59:21,659
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll also speak with legal to make sure that we have the key pieces of

562
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:30,403
[SPEAKER_11]: language that needs to remain within the policy because regarding bullying and both cyber bullying.

563
00:59:30,423 --> 00:59:32,964
[SPEAKER_06]: You mean within the policy or within the plan?

564
00:59:32,984 --> 00:59:33,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

565
00:59:33,284 --> 00:59:36,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Within the plan, within the bullying and intervention plan.

566
00:59:36,985 --> 00:59:45,769
[SPEAKER_11]: So within the plan, that could be something that I work with the administrators on and having us review that.

567
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:49,050
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do need to confirm what portions

568
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,692
[SPEAKER_11]: of the language should not be changed.

569
00:59:52,732 --> 00:59:59,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I do believe that there is certain language that needs to be, that needs to remain within the plan.

570
00:59:59,336 --> 01:00:01,757
[SPEAKER_11]: So I agree on that piece.

571
01:00:02,597 --> 01:00:02,898
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

572
01:00:02,918 --> 01:00:09,181
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to be clear about when I talked about language, it was there's like weird inconsistencies all the all over the place.

573
01:00:09,201 --> 01:00:14,024
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes it's the victim versus the target or the perpetrator versus the aggressor, or the

574
01:00:14,554 --> 01:00:19,558
[SPEAKER_17]: The parent or the parent slash caregiver, parent slash guardian, parent slash caregiver, guardian.

575
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:28,607
[SPEAKER_17]: The consistency within the document on a whole lot of things was not there.

576
01:00:28,887 --> 01:00:34,772
[SPEAKER_17]: And looking at some of the other plans, they all seem to have a great section on definitions.

577
01:00:36,243 --> 01:00:37,224
[SPEAKER_17]: that we don't have.

578
01:00:38,425 --> 01:00:43,491
[SPEAKER_17]: And that definitions thing is really critical.

579
01:00:46,461 --> 01:00:53,903
[SPEAKER_17]: I wasn't looking for changing any language around that would affect what the plan was saying or doing, just so everybody understands that.

580
01:00:54,203 --> 01:01:03,605
[SPEAKER_17]: I felt like the first draft that I was suggesting changing was simply to find and replace on parent and that whole thing to get it consistent.

581
01:01:03,905 --> 01:01:10,707
[SPEAKER_17]: And the two and a half pages that are duplicated, two and a half pages after the first time they're listed,

582
01:01:12,434 --> 01:01:16,417
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, verbatim, which I still am very confused by.

583
01:01:17,418 --> 01:01:18,899
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know we're over time.

584
01:01:18,919 --> 01:01:23,123
[SPEAKER_17]: Member McLaughlin, is your hand up still because you didn't take it down?

585
01:01:23,964 --> 01:01:26,546
[SPEAKER_06]: No, actually, it was up again.

586
01:01:26,566 --> 01:01:34,553
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually just wanted to ask if you could share, and we can also do this legwork before the next meeting as well, obviously, but it seems like you've done some

587
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,703
[SPEAKER_06]: in terms of looking at policies for other schools.

588
01:01:37,763 --> 01:01:42,507
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to share some of those links, that would be really helpful in the chat that we could sort of look at.

589
01:01:42,607 --> 01:01:56,860
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that, you know, if we, I guess I would ask the superintendent or some of the administration, if you were letting the lay people in the community know, what districts would you say are comparable to Medford in terms of

590
01:01:58,521 --> 01:02:03,504
[SPEAKER_06]: demographics, sort of, you know, so that we're comparing apples to apples in some ways.

591
01:02:03,544 --> 01:02:16,590
[SPEAKER_06]: We can also go with, you know, best practices that we think are from districts that we think are really working well, but I'm just, as we often compare districts to districts, I want folks to know which districts are sort of similar to Medford.

592
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:19,391
[SPEAKER_06]: If anyone can sort of share that, that would be helpful.

593
01:02:19,411 --> 01:02:25,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

594
01:02:25,574 --> 01:02:26,154
[SPEAKER_03]: Last commenter.

595
01:02:26,738 --> 01:02:28,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

596
01:02:31,934 --> 01:02:32,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you unmute yourself?

597
01:02:32,796 --> 01:02:33,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

598
01:02:42,256 --> 01:02:44,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you able to unmute yourself?

599
01:02:44,317 --> 01:02:44,997
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

600
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:45,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I am now.

601
01:02:46,438 --> 01:02:47,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

602
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:58,723
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think some of us out here in TV land might be a little bit confused about what is the difference between a policy and a plan?

603
01:02:59,603 --> 01:03:05,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like we have a plan now, but not a policy, if I'm understanding correctly.

604
01:03:05,285 --> 01:03:08,266
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we need both?

605
01:03:08,346 --> 01:03:09,467
[SPEAKER_01]: And which comes first?

606
01:03:10,896 --> 01:03:11,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

607
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:19,499
[SPEAKER_17]: That's an excellent question and I was trying to get to that point, a few minutes ago and I wasn't as direct as I should have been.

608
01:03:20,539 --> 01:03:27,181
[SPEAKER_17]: This is based on a law, and most of our policies, I mean some of our policies have legal references.

609
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:32,432
[SPEAKER_17]: this law was explicit in what the thing is called.

610
01:03:33,213 --> 01:03:34,694
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that's pretty unusual.

611
01:03:34,834 --> 01:03:44,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Usually there's a law and maybe the law has a name and it tells us what we're going to do generally, but it doesn't lay out that you're going to go create a document and it's going to be called this.

612
01:03:45,724 --> 01:03:52,790
[SPEAKER_17]: And unfortunately that is explicitly called the bullying prevention and intervention plan

613
01:03:54,915 --> 01:04:02,338
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just a very weird situation where it gets so exact as to what we have to do and what it will be called.

614
01:04:03,319 --> 01:04:08,441
[SPEAKER_17]: So your confusion is completely appropriate because it is confusing.

615
01:04:09,862 --> 01:04:19,946
[SPEAKER_17]: But my mind right now, until we adopt an actual policy as a school committee, the plan is the policy.

616
01:04:21,487 --> 01:04:23,948
[SPEAKER_17]: And looking at other districts that have actually,

617
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:29,114
[SPEAKER_17]: actually adopted a policy separate from the plan, they have both.

618
01:04:30,535 --> 01:04:33,097
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, it's messy.

619
01:04:33,377 --> 01:04:40,261
[SPEAKER_17]: It's definitely not the cleanest thing I've seen around policy stuff for sure.

620
01:04:42,403 --> 01:04:50,828
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you for asking that question, because that definitely is, I think we're gonna have to repeat that particular thing multiple times throughout this process.

621
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:53,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

622
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:54,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Brandley.

623
01:05:08,462 --> 01:05:08,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

624
01:05:08,902 --> 01:05:12,664
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to just say just a couple of things.

625
01:05:12,924 --> 01:05:16,806
[SPEAKER_08]: One, um, I worked in a responsive classroom for six years.

626
01:05:17,506 --> 01:05:22,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think it's definitely imperative that we have responsive classroom.

627
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:25,730
[SPEAKER_08]: I've sat in close to 180 nexus classes.

628
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:30,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's important.

629
01:05:30,952 --> 01:05:34,994
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think that it's great for the kids that are in elementary school now.

630
01:05:37,344 --> 01:05:41,407
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do feel that as we get to the high school, that there is a little bit more of a disconnect.

631
01:05:42,668 --> 01:05:50,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the wording, I don't think many kids in high school are gonna go to, let's just say Mr. DeLaver and say, I'm feeling like I'm in the red zone right now.

632
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,436
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I feel like I'm having rock brain.

633
01:05:54,836 --> 01:05:58,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are some of the terms that we use in elementary school, which are great.

634
01:05:59,819 --> 01:06:04,983
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't feel like as we get a little bit older and we're feeling a little bit more,

635
01:06:06,035 --> 01:06:06,916
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe confident.

636
01:06:08,237 --> 01:06:10,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, I think kids think they know everything.

637
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:18,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I think some of that is not going to be used as they grow up.

638
01:06:19,627 --> 01:06:30,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think from what I've seen at the middle school, um, I can't agree with Mr. Tucci enough that he is so proactive.

639
01:06:31,116 --> 01:06:32,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I think that, um,

640
01:06:33,885 --> 01:06:38,427
[SPEAKER_08]: that really needs to be carried out through all of the school years.

641
01:06:39,127 --> 01:06:41,168
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to be proactive.

642
01:06:43,789 --> 01:06:52,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the wording, you know, and even Mr. Rossell, you just said, I feel sorrow for those needing to know all 38 pages.

643
01:06:54,113 --> 01:06:55,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I read all 38 pages.

644
01:06:56,834 --> 01:06:57,374
[SPEAKER_08]: I read it more.

645
01:06:59,355 --> 01:07:03,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I did exactly what you did before going to bed.

646
01:07:04,713 --> 01:07:07,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I highlighted every single thing in here.

647
01:07:08,474 --> 01:07:16,817
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel like when you're a leader at our school, it is your job to study these things.

648
01:07:16,837 --> 01:07:20,818
[SPEAKER_08]: So is there sorrow that there has to be 38 pages of this?

649
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:21,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

650
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Does some have to be included law-wise, policy-wise, plan-wise?

651
01:07:27,827 --> 01:07:36,251
[SPEAKER_08]: but I don't know what parts we cut out besides duplicate, because there's a lot of duplicate information there, because I did turn back and say, oh my God, am I reading the same thing twice or am I going there?

652
01:07:36,311 --> 01:07:37,032
[SPEAKER_08]: I was late.

653
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:52,239
[SPEAKER_08]: But I feel like if we don't cover every base, it could be the one wording or one sentence that could matter in someone's life.

654
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,481
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to make sure that that is out there.

655
01:07:57,492 --> 01:07:59,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, elementary school responsive classroom.

656
01:07:59,633 --> 01:08:00,714
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked in a responsive classroom.

657
01:08:00,734 --> 01:08:02,615
[SPEAKER_08]: This is amazing.

658
01:08:02,895 --> 01:08:04,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't ever, there there's no bad children.

659
01:08:04,957 --> 01:08:06,598
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of unexpected behavior.

660
01:08:08,078 --> 01:08:10,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so that's part of the wording, right?

661
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:11,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Expected.

662
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:12,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that was very unexpected.

663
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:14,002
[SPEAKER_08]: This is very expected.

664
01:08:14,722 --> 01:08:18,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think that we need to see a lot more expected behavior.

665
01:08:18,985 --> 01:08:27,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I think it needs to be pushed up to, um, the upper levels where kids think that they're going to rule and they don't.

666
01:08:27,432 --> 01:08:30,213
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to make sure that that was out there.

667
01:08:30,533 --> 01:08:39,817
[SPEAKER_08]: And as always, whatever you need for me to help move forward with policies or plans or anything in between, I'm more than happy to work with anybody and everybody.

668
01:08:39,857 --> 01:08:40,657
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much.

669
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:42,658
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

670
01:08:43,098 --> 01:08:46,720
[SPEAKER_17]: And I certainly, I agree that

671
01:08:47,907 --> 01:08:53,370
[SPEAKER_17]: our staff needs to know what our policies and procedures are, and that is part of their job.

672
01:08:54,891 --> 01:08:58,893
[SPEAKER_17]: The, I feel sorry part was just like, there's so much that they didn't need to read in that.

673
01:08:59,393 --> 01:09:00,014
[SPEAKER_17]: I agree.

674
01:09:00,394 --> 01:09:06,117
[SPEAKER_17]: To actually have had the same, to be able to do it.

675
01:09:06,897 --> 01:09:11,620
[SPEAKER_17]: So let's see, member Graham, I'll let you have the final word.

676
01:09:12,998 --> 01:09:14,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

677
01:09:15,139 --> 01:09:22,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to circle back to Eunice's question about sort of there being a lot of confusion.

678
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,666
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's really fair.

679
01:09:24,686 --> 01:09:27,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I think of policy as the what.

680
01:09:28,288 --> 01:09:31,291
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we want the superintendent to do?

681
01:09:31,311 --> 01:09:36,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think of her procedures or her plans as the how.

682
01:09:36,815 --> 01:09:37,956
[SPEAKER_04]: how will it happen?

683
01:09:38,076 --> 01:09:51,971
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would expect things just as an example, like I would expect us to say, we want you to have two bullying information sessions per year.

684
01:09:53,092 --> 01:09:58,537
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're not gonna say in the policy is, and they should be on the third Tuesday of the month,

685
01:10:00,089 --> 01:10:11,273
[SPEAKER_04]: of the fourth month of the school year at 7pm, so I think of that as like a pretty simplistic example but it's it's always super murky, particularly when you.

686
01:10:13,723 --> 01:10:16,504
[SPEAKER_04]: care that the policies can be enacted.

687
01:10:16,664 --> 01:10:27,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where the collaboration between the school committee and the superintendent's office is really important because nobody wants to spend this time to write policy that can't be executed.

688
01:10:28,548 --> 01:10:41,632
[SPEAKER_04]: But we also wanna make sure that if something can't be executed, that we're having that dialogue about why not, so that either we can find a compromise that does not compromise

689
01:10:42,552 --> 01:10:55,527
[SPEAKER_04]: the what, or that we can prioritize the resources that are needed to actually make that what available by giving the right tools to the superintendent and her team to make the how happen.

690
01:10:55,587 --> 01:11:02,135
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it is murky, particularly when you talk about change, because you need both of those things and they need to work together.

691
01:11:02,677 --> 01:11:04,878
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you need to actually go forth and execute.

692
01:11:04,938 --> 01:11:14,383
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it is murky, but I think like for me and I get wrapped up in the how, because I'm an implementer at heart.

693
01:11:15,364 --> 01:11:22,348
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do try to remember what versus how, and that usually sort of brings me back to like the ground floor of like what we're trying to do with policy.

694
01:11:24,449 --> 01:11:25,309
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

695
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:30,952
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I think it's always helpful to hear the what versus the how.

696
01:11:32,845 --> 01:11:37,847
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, the name of this particular thing includes the house.

697
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's very awkward there.

698
01:11:41,488 --> 01:11:43,969
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like to thank everyone for being here.

699
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:46,409
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought this was very productive.

700
01:11:46,449 --> 01:11:49,010
[SPEAKER_17]: And I felt like we had a lot of great information.

701
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:51,251
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like we definitely have next steps.

702
01:11:52,031 --> 01:12:01,174
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will schedule another one of these meetings, probably the second or third week of January, I have to look at the other

703
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, rules and policy subcommittee meeting.

704
01:12:04,671 --> 01:12:08,013
[SPEAKER_17]: We have, we also need to schedule, uh, related to recess.

705
01:12:08,474 --> 01:12:15,879
[SPEAKER_17]: So it kind of, we're probably like leapfrog these two topics until we get one or both of them done.

706
01:12:15,899 --> 01:12:18,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so motion to adjourn.

707
01:12:19,361 --> 01:12:19,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

708
01:12:20,082 --> 01:12:20,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, second.

709
01:12:20,822 --> 01:12:21,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a second?

710
01:12:22,544 --> 01:12:23,364
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, thank you.

711
01:12:23,805 --> 01:12:25,065
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, member Graham.

712
01:12:25,826 --> 01:12:26,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

713
01:12:28,048 --> 01:12:28,868
[SPEAKER_17]: Member McLaughlin.

714
01:12:29,489 --> 01:12:29,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

715
01:12:31,115 --> 01:12:36,450
[SPEAKER_17]: And member so yes, this meeting is adjourned by 45pm have a great night everyone.

716
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:36,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
