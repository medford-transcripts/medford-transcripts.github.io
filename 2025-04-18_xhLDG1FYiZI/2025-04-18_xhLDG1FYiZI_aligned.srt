1
00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:04,453
No, it's not resilience, is it?

2
00:00:04,473 --> 00:00:05,914
A climate engagement associate.

3
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:08,176
Client engagement associate, yes, beautiful.

4
00:00:08,956 --> 00:00:20,104
Shannon engages community members and organizations in the upstream misted communities to ensure climate resilient solutions reflect their interests and needs.

5
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:28,550
She works on building relationships around the impacts of stormwater flooding and other issues residents are facing due to climate change.

6
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:37,336
Before joining MIRA, she completed a service term in public health through AmeriCorps, hosted by Everett Community Growers.

7
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:43,201
During that time, she grew a passion for community engagement and food justice.

8
00:00:43,721 --> 00:00:51,427
Shannon graduated from the University of Connecticut, go Huskies, with a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies and Human Rights.

9
00:00:51,907 --> 00:00:57,651
In her free time, this is interesting, she enjoys going for walks, crocheting,

10
00:00:58,572 --> 00:00:59,213
Cutting hair.

11
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:01,094
I was trying to figure that one out.

12
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:01,434
OK.

13
00:01:01,754 --> 00:01:03,195
And trying new foods.

14
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:08,139
Please allow me to introduce a new friend to the program, Myra Shannon Collins.

15
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:12,062
All righty.

16
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:12,602
All righty.

17
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:30,249
So as is my custom in hosting these evenings, those of you that have been to a number of them certainly know this, and particularly as we observe National Poetry Month, I'd like to share a bit of verse to help shape the evening.

18
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,732
I'm in my justice phase for a whole lot of reasons.

19
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:53,400
Okay, um, and since we're going to talk about being abutters to a great New England river, and since my mind is always on equity, um, and, um, and social justice, let's have a listen to Mystic River Melancholy.

20
00:01:55,561 --> 00:02:04,286
The freshly quaffed boho boys make real estate videos extolling the finer virtues of West Medford and life along the Mystic River.

21
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:10,449
Maybe they're new money kids or tough grads that don't know the rich history of the village.

22
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:21,356
They do have a sense that this is a minor mecca for ex-city dwellers, flush with IPO cash, NFT windfalls, or Bitcoin early adoptions.

23
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:30,183
A new gentry that wants to be landed for their dogs and their Range Rovers and their wine tastings and the next generation of trust fund babies.

24
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:35,166
The would-be property princes have a target market.

25
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:38,109
The YouTube appeal is slick and shiny.

26
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:42,192
Classic Americana with a side of sushi or a venti mocha latte.

27
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:45,357
They have no idea of what used to be.

28
00:02:45,978 --> 00:02:48,318
They know what the next wave wants to see.

29
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,939
They want to see the bikes, the hikes, and the kids on trikes.

30
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:54,559
They want to post pics that will get lots of likes.

31
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,440
They want to see the flowering trees and the birds and the bees.

32
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,080
Their high rise havens had none of these.

33
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:09,082
They want to see if they can grow something green in a backyard garden beyond the green that's growing in their bulging bank accounts.

34
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:13,975
Designer overalls and Doc Martens do not a farmer make.

35
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:21,680
No worries, Whole Foods has gone 100% organic with a great selection of finely curated herbs and spices.

36
00:03:23,258 --> 00:03:25,219
I know that this sounds like resentment.

37
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,741
Resignation frequently does.

38
00:03:28,461 --> 00:03:40,268
But when the private boat clubs bookend the public beach and the abutters don't want loud, unruly Dominicans descending on their hillsides for beachfront parking, well, what's a brother from the Ville to think?

39
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:43,830
My daddy taught me how to fish here.

40
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,454
Not much more than eels and sunfish in the water then, but we felt like it was legacy.

41
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:52,675
And we were happy to have it.

42
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:57,516
They really didn't want us at their beach back then either.

43
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:00,258
But we were mighty in our minority.

44
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:01,959
We didn't want to fight, folks.

45
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,924
But the lake wasn't exactly pristine, so why begrudge it to anybody?

46
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:15,491
We could walk the half mile or ride our stingray bikes down the infield connected to the small waves and the gentle wake.

47
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:20,695
We could wonder about the kayakers and the canoe paddlers.

48
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:27,493
the colorful sunfishes, occasional scholars, and the ubiquitous motor boaters.

49
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:35,414
We could dream a little dream about owning a dinghy and a trawling engine and making a few waves of our own.

50
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:37,395
Don't get me wrong.

51
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:48,897
I love the new fish ladders and the intrepid herring counters, the trout infusion, and the bald eagle sightings, and the focus on environmental sustainability.

52
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:56,074
Thing is, they love it too, and they can afford to pay for it.

53
00:04:56,094 --> 00:04:59,716
1.4 mil for Queen Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker's old homestead.

54
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:02,477
It should have been a historical landmark.

55
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:06,480
Instead, it's yet another preview of coming attractions.

56
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:18,827
Meanwhile, the sleepy little Nubian Hamlet has released its black and brown patina to the inexorable tug of real property values and the dying off of the old guard.

57
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:26,966
Mine is the last generation that knew about the first three streets, Arlington, Lincoln, and Jerome.

58
00:05:27,466 --> 00:05:34,613
That knew about the little store, the old Shiloh Baptist, and the library in the fire station.

59
00:05:35,554 --> 00:05:51,703
Mine is the last generation that knew about Charlie Booker and the Bruins, the five fighting Phillips brothers, Uncle Buddy's postal command, Doc Count's blue books, Faucina and Evelyn's beauty salon, and exactly why it's called Duggar Park.

60
00:05:52,929 --> 00:06:00,734
So many firsts, so much history, so little time to savor and to save, to preserve and to pass on.

61
00:06:01,574 --> 00:06:08,058
So many departures and so few arrivals of the black and the brown and the tan.

62
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:11,611
Meanwhile, the developers mostly have their way.

63
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:15,415
The Spanish day laborers tear it down, build it back up.

64
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:20,099
Like Lee Majors and the six million dollar man, they have the technology.

65
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:22,301
They can make them better than they were.

66
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,763
Better, stronger, faster.

67
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:30,501
Condos and townhouses, Tony and Trendy out with the old, in with the new.

68
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:33,203
Wash, rinse, and repeat.

69
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:44,850
Meanwhile, the freshly quaffed boho boys make real estate videos, extolling the finer virtues of West Medford and life along the Mystic River.

70
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:48,232
All right.

71
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:50,914
All right.

72
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:51,794
Very good.

73
00:06:51,974 --> 00:06:52,535
Very good.

74
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:58,299
So now let's have a look at Myra and see what's new and exciting.

75
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:02,982
It's time for a friendly chat with our friend Shannon Collins.

76
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:13,130
So Shannon, will you talk a little bit about your educational background and what attracted you to environmental studies and human rights as a major?

77
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:14,717
Absolutely.

78
00:07:15,378 --> 00:07:29,777
So I studied environmental studies at UConn and I started doing environmental science because I really just like being outside and then took my first lab class and realized I couldn't do the math and like microscope kind of science.

79
00:07:30,978 --> 00:07:44,729
But I really loved the environment still, and I knew I loved people, so I was like, how do I find a job where I can work with people all day, but it's for the betterment of the environment and addressing climate change, which I think is probably the issue of my generation.

80
00:07:45,870 --> 00:08:07,464
I immediately after school worked in Everett at the Everett Community Growers Community Farm organization and it was like a perfect combination of working with people and a local community and getting some really important things done but like for the earth and for the community and that's my favorite thing so at Mystic River Watershed I got to do a really similar work so I love it.

81
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:08,485
Fantastic.

82
00:08:08,505 --> 00:08:10,346
Now were you from here originally?

83
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:18,101
So I grew up in Melrose, my dad grew up in Arlington, and my parents' first apartment together was actually on High Street.

84
00:08:18,362 --> 00:08:20,162
Okay, so you're somewhat local.

85
00:08:20,322 --> 00:08:20,683
Pretty local.

86
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:22,123
Okay, very good, very good.

87
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:29,507
For the folks that may not be familiar with MIRA, can you talk about the mission and the work of the organization?

88
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:38,182
Yes, so the watershed, for those that don't know, is a big regional way of thinking about the connections from the Mystic River.

89
00:08:38,282 --> 00:08:46,023
So it's 21 communities from Boston up to Burlington and Reading, all in between, and it all drains into the Mystic River.

90
00:08:46,143 --> 00:08:48,264
So that's the area we work in.

91
00:08:48,464 --> 00:08:54,005
And because water doesn't care about town lines, we work throughout all those towns and communities.

92
00:08:54,885 --> 00:09:10,604
Myra works with keeping the river healthy, the communities healthy, and started as just a water quality organization and then has grown way more into looking at parks and paths like we're talking about today, looking at climate, looking at river herring.

93
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:13,368
So yeah, we do a lot of cool things.

94
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:16,107
Okay, very good, very good.

95
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:25,251
So my own experience with Myra has shown me that you're very much a volunteer-driven organization.

96
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:31,433
What sort of ways can community members be involved with the watershed?

97
00:09:32,292 --> 00:09:37,695
Yeah, so it's Poetry Month and it's also Earth Month, which is a really cool combination.

98
00:09:37,775 --> 00:09:44,539
So as it's getting warmer, there's so many ways to get out into the watershed and do some volunteering with us and other awesome groups.

99
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:46,140
So we do have a ton of events.

100
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,961
I wrote some down because it's a really exciting time.

101
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:54,204
We have a lot of tree plantings coming up, which are going to be really fun for Earth Month.

102
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,946
We do trash pickups as well.

103
00:09:57,026 --> 00:10:00,088
So get your gloves on and pick up some trash in your favorite park.

104
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:04,651
We're doing a refresh of the mural up at the Mystic Dam.

105
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:09,715
So we do lots of art projects, like educational programs too, which is cool.

106
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,236
You could help out with anything.

107
00:10:12,637 --> 00:10:14,318
We do invasive species removals.

108
00:10:14,678 --> 00:10:18,701
So plants that are suffocating, like the native plants, we rip them out.

109
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:22,044
We bring people with a bunch of clippers and gloves and rip them out.

110
00:10:23,524 --> 00:10:31,908
We do water quality monitoring so you can volunteer and you can learn about how we measure the water quality and get down in the water and look at samples there.

111
00:10:32,288 --> 00:10:35,249
We count the river herring and track their migration.

112
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,171
Yeah, and we have really cool events coming up this summer.

113
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,833
So if you subscribe to our newsletter, you can hear about something every month and get involved in.

114
00:10:45,173 --> 00:11:03,938
Yeah, I like the fact that there's virtually nothing that you do that you don't seek to hear the voices of the communities that are being impacted by whatever it is that you're talking about, whatever it is that you're planning and talking about.

115
00:11:04,518 --> 00:11:21,594
So, I know the big deal for the organization right now in terms of, you know, kind of planning projects and developing new strategies is our own Mystic Shoreline initiative.

116
00:11:22,075 --> 00:11:25,258
So would you like to enlighten us a little bit about that?

117
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:34,915
Absolutely, so the Mystic Shoreline Initiative is part of our Greenways program, so talking about the paths along the river or the parks too.

118
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:50,970
And in this project, it's been ongoing for a couple years, we're talking about the Mystic Lakes, the eastern shoreline and Mystic Valley Parkway, down past the Rotaries on High Street, all the way up around our beautiful West Medford shoreline to Boston Ave.

119
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,231
So that's our project area.

120
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,793
And through this project, we've also looked at roadway safety.

121
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,294
That came a lot more last year.

122
00:11:59,314 --> 00:12:04,877
And this year, we spent a lot more time on the West Medford chunk of the shoreline itself.

123
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:06,998
So it's been a really cool process.

124
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:11,380
And I can dive a little bit more into the specifics of the project.

125
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,841
Yes, absolutely.

126
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,742
But I want to give a disclaimer first.

127
00:12:15,749 --> 00:12:30,595
I actually had the pleasure in the enlightenment of serving on the steering committee for one half of this shoreline initiative and now serving on the steering committee for the other half, which is

128
00:12:31,455 --> 00:12:33,076
What's happening here in West Medford?

129
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:37,897
So I just want to want to let you know I'm a big fan.

130
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:42,178
I'm a big fan of what's being discussed Okay, so take it away.

131
00:12:42,378 --> 00:12:42,799
Yeah.

132
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:45,359
Yeah, and like you said, it's all community driven.

133
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:53,522
So we're glad to be chatting about it So basically, we know this is a amazing culturally rich area environmentally incredible

134
00:12:54,022 --> 00:13:02,486
historically significant for a lot of folks and we've also heard from a lot of folks in the community and the state and That there's some challenges there.

135
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:16,952
So we're looking at accessibility So people being able to use the path with all like needs and we're looking at ecological improvements so when it comes to erosion of the paths or the way stormwater is affecting in the river and

136
00:13:17,372 --> 00:13:18,833
And we're also looking at recreation.

137
00:13:18,853 --> 00:13:20,395
So do we need more benches?

138
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:21,215
Stuff like that.

139
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:25,119
So that's our project right now, which is really awesome.

140
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:31,924
And like you said, we have a steering committee, which is incredible, which is 14 people from the neighborhood.

141
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:36,188
They all have amazing backgrounds and stories related to the neighborhood and the river.

142
00:13:36,948 --> 00:13:40,512
And we come together and we talk about, okay, what do we want to see here?

143
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:44,737
And we also dive in with maps and really get into the specifics.

144
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:47,620
We also bring it out to the community at large.

145
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,664
I've been putting flyers up if anyone sees them on the streets.

146
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:52,085
I did see one today.

147
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,206
Good, good.

148
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:56,270
And last night we had our second meeting that was public on Zoom.

149
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,233
And so there we bring it to everyone and we say, here's our plan, what do you guys think?

150
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:07,358
We have people put their input right in Zoom, and if you can't make it to Zoom, you can fill out a survey after.

151
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:14,783
So we're trying to get as much comments as possible, and we've gotten thousands of comments of people's opinions on the idea, so it's awesome.

152
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:32,690
Yeah, and it may take a long time for it to happen, but in each case, the case from High Street down to the Mystic Lakes and slightly beyond that, as well as the case from this side of High Street and on down to Boston Ave,

153
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:44,244
both developments would dramatically change and enhance the way that people can use the resources.

154
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:47,648
I really believe that that's true.

155
00:14:50,330 --> 00:15:02,814
So, it's pretty extraordinary stuff, but it's also really, really ambitious, especially given, you know, kind of where we're at socially right now.

156
00:15:03,154 --> 00:15:05,534
So, and you talked about there being some challenges.

157
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:08,435
Can you talk a little bit more about what some of those challenges might be?

158
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:22,262
Yeah, so the current challenges that we're seeing along the path that people are bringing to us are a lot, a lot of comments about how it's a dirt path with a lot of roots and that just is not accessible for a wheelchair, for a stroller.

159
00:15:23,203 --> 00:15:28,988
So kind of just like, what can we do to make this actual path more connected and accessible for everybody?

160
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,429
So that's one of our huge goals.

161
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:50,011
We've also been looking at traffic safety a lot and the tragic passing By the rotary this winter is absolutely raising how important this is in this area So we've gotten so many comments to about just making crosswalks like speed, but whatever we can do So that's also a huge thing.

162
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:50,812
We're looking at and

163
00:15:51,693 --> 00:16:08,922
and then with erosion, so looking at the actual shoreline environment, and do we have invasive plants, do we have places where it's just not constructed well along the river, so it's not good for the river or the land, so yeah, lots of great opportunities.

164
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:20,288
Yeah, I mean, so many things have come up in our discussions in terms of the steering committee, and the issue of parking, obviously, and then there,

165
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:32,750
you know, the issues of, you know, kind of noise and, you know, the abutters, you know, having some issues with, you know, some of the things that are, you know, going on during the summer and, you know.

166
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:47,822
It's one of those you can't make everybody happy, but you try to find solutions that improve it a little for everybody and a lot for some folks, and hopefully everybody.

167
00:16:48,342 --> 00:17:00,987
So I guess the other thing is right now implementing expensive infrastructure improvements without having full control of the funding streams

168
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:12,209
and the required state and federal supports, it puts us in a real bind in terms of predicting how soon these things can happen.

169
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:25,438
Absolutely, and it's the hardest question because with this work, you do kind of have to realize it takes years just to get a plan and then to get the plan approved and then to get stuff constructed.

170
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:31,222
It takes so long, but my organization's role is pretty much just being the one to lead these

171
00:17:31,602 --> 00:17:49,040
Community processes and the meetings and the surveys and we're just collecting all the information so that eventually With obviously we can't promise anything, you know, you never really know but like what's important is just getting all this together so that we can hand it off and Hopefully see it through

172
00:17:49,500 --> 00:18:07,253
I mean, we at the community center really know about this first hand because we have been trying to provoke the powers that be, particularly the city of Medford and DCR in partnership, to make some improvements back out here so we could have two things.

173
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:22,592
One is a path across the DCR land to the street, so that people coming into the center from this side don't have to walk through mush and mud and snow, so that we could at least have a pavable path.

174
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:30,137
And then the other thing is safety issues and parking issues on Mystic River Road.

175
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:38,241
And we finally have pretty much all the nuts and bolts in place to have that happen.

176
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:39,622
And fortunately,

177
00:18:40,763 --> 00:18:50,030
it actually kind of went beyond what we're hoping and turned into a plan for basically from Harvard Ave all the way down to Fairfield Street.

178
00:18:50,630 --> 00:19:05,541
So it's gonna make some pretty dramatic improvements overall in how people can experience this part of the geography that you guys are talking about with the Mystic River side of the PATH project.

179
00:19:07,122 --> 00:19:15,172
So tell me more specifically what kind of your public engagement process looks like.

180
00:19:15,998 --> 00:19:27,880
Yeah, so it's been a really, really incredible process and I've had a lot of fun working on this because basically a lot of my job has been hanging up flyers and I've found nice, beautiful days.

181
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:41,343
I walk up and down, I walk through the neighborhoods and what we do is we have a steering committee put together, incredible folks with such amazing stories to bring and such great conversations across the table.

182
00:19:42,103 --> 00:20:00,122
Well you know it's important to have like some comments about we love a natural feel to things you know sometimes people really love the dirt right hiking feel so how do we how do we honor that and how do we also add accessibility and it's a really awesome dialogue and we're so grateful to have community leaders like you on our steering committee.

183
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:13,029
I had never heard of a ramble until we started talking about how the natural path in some instances is preferable to anything that's really engineered.

184
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,892
But also to counter that was, and you mentioned it earlier,

185
00:20:19,672 --> 00:20:37,697
all of the roots from the trees that can sometimes impact how that nice natural path can be accessed by people who have any disabilities, particularly that require a wheelchair or canes, crutches, etc.

186
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,357
and so forth.

187
00:20:39,097 --> 00:20:41,859
So yeah, it's very interesting.

188
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:42,839
It's great.

189
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:51,684
And people's different stories about like, well, one time I was putting my kayak in over here and or one time I was in Winchester and I saw this new bench.

190
00:20:51,724 --> 00:20:52,784
Can we get something like that?

191
00:20:52,844 --> 00:20:56,026
Like hearing people's specific input is so amazing.

192
00:20:56,526 --> 00:21:08,137
And it's really fun for me too because I get to listen to those conversations, then we open it up on Zoom and we invite all neighbors to come and chat with us and we get so many more comments there.

193
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:19,427
Then we go back to our offices and read through them all and sort them out and we say, okay, we got 100 comments about the path, we got 60 comments about benches, signs, it's really exciting.

194
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:21,809
I have some specifics for you if you're interested.

195
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:33,832
So we broke it up into three categories, so accessibility, like the paths and such, the environment, so the shorelines, environmental health, and the recreation.

196
00:21:33,912 --> 00:21:42,435
So we got 162 comments talking about safe roadway crossings, to no one's surprise, so that's a huge accessibility thing.

197
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:50,437
Also lots of comments about access to the shoreline, educational interpretive signage, which is really fun,

198
00:21:51,097 --> 00:22:14,322
Okay, that was me Lighting maybe some wayfinding signage so like to show people where they're at some more like history stuff like that So that was really cool some specific comments We got were a lot about the bridges and the rotaries and just connecting the trails And also, yeah, like I have a stroller.

199
00:22:14,342 --> 00:22:15,042
I have a wheelchair.

200
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:20,363
This is not accessible to me Like that's invaluable to hear for us and bring back to the project team.

201
00:22:20,383 --> 00:22:20,783
Absolutely

202
00:22:21,784 --> 00:22:33,670
And then also when we looked at the environment, we got 70 plus comments about the beautiful trees, making sure we're protecting the trees along the path, maybe having some more trees or better maintained new trees.

203
00:22:34,531 --> 00:22:37,872
We got a lot of comments about some native plantings.

204
00:22:38,072 --> 00:22:47,918
So ripping out those invasive species that are crowding and having like a pollinator meadow or like plants that are there to sustain and natural to the area.

205
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:50,279
So lots of comments about that.

206
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:52,520
We got a lot of trash receptacle comments.

207
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,443
That's a huge one So yeah Really cool stuff.

208
00:22:57,563 --> 00:23:16,472
I love the idea of like incorporating public art memorials like information And then for recreation we got a lot of comments about having more overlooks so like intentional clearings to look out to the river so maybe just that's removing a little bit of the shrubbery at the bottom and opening it up a little bit more and

209
00:23:17,853 --> 00:23:20,935
Improved non-motorized boating access is a big one.

210
00:23:20,995 --> 00:23:26,978
So that's such a question in our meetings is how do you let people put their kayaks, but it's not a jet ski.

211
00:23:28,099 --> 00:23:29,140
That came up so much.

212
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,043
And yeah, some cool comments about the open lawn areas.

213
00:23:34,203 --> 00:23:37,745
So like people sharing that they bring their dogs, how important it is for that.

214
00:23:38,805 --> 00:23:41,567
picnic tables, all really cool, really cool stuff.

215
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:44,429
So yeah, and we're still open to comments.

216
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:45,970
It's an ongoing process.

217
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,591
Absolutely, absolutely.

218
00:23:47,671 --> 00:24:06,563
So in terms of, so maybe folks can get an idea of some of the types of things that have kind of been teased out, especially in the plan from High Street down to almost to Winchester, or actually to Winchester, Wedgmere,

219
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:13,646
What kinds of things are, you know, have been scoped out in terms of implementation?

220
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:18,749
Yeah, so again, I have my notes here because there's a lot of great stuff.

221
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:36,078
So we have a lot of, again, breaking it into like safety, accessibility, environmental, we have a lot of proposed safer crossings, which is huge, and our design team makes really cool maps where they show all this out, and you can find that on our website, which I'll plug at the end.

222
00:24:37,519 --> 00:25:02,359
But safer crossings was a huge one So they mapped out a bunch of areas where they thought it'd be good to have some safety improvements on the road We also have that Improved path so not a paved path, but like a stone dust That's better for a wheelchair user or something and maybe why they widening the path a little bit making it more like accessible and regular and like just a little bit more connected along the stretch and

223
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:22,819
And then wayfinding signs, which I think are awesome some benches I think would be huge and yeah, maybe a scenic overview so like selective clearing of the Shrubbery to have some intentional spots to go and enjoy So those are some have some more

224
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:38,552
info We have yeah picnic tables nature play which I think is cute like a Natural little like set of logs for kids to jump on stuff like that Non-motorized boat launches.

225
00:25:38,612 --> 00:25:46,099
So just kind of formalizing where people are already putting their kayaks Maybe making some of the steeper sections a little bit more, you know

226
00:25:46,859 --> 00:26:08,911
regular The steps from Boston Ave that go down to the path that there's no steps It's just kind of like that weird block and you're kind of you feel like you're in someone's backyard Formalizing that entrance a little bit So yeah lots of really cool stuff and totally go on our website and check out the pictures Because that's such a good way to look absolutely put your input.

227
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:15,295
Yeah Fantastic Okay I

228
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:27,637
Okay, so again, if folks wanna get involved, whether they're folks in the audience or folks at home, what would be the best thing for them to do?

229
00:26:28,257 --> 00:26:36,543
Yeah, so for this process, we started last year and had our consultants and landscape architects survey the area.

230
00:26:36,583 --> 00:26:42,727
So they looked at everything, took pictures, checked out the erosion, the roads, everything.

231
00:26:44,048 --> 00:26:52,258
and then we went into our visioning process which is where I was saying we got thousands of comments and that was kind of just a What do you like?

232
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:53,159
What do you not like?

233
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:54,300
What do you think we should do?

234
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,842
What do you think we shouldn't touch?

235
00:26:56,643 --> 00:26:58,164
So that process is really huge.

236
00:26:58,204 --> 00:27:02,850
That was cool that was our first meeting to our first public meeting and steering committee meeting was just a

237
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,431
Generally, what do folks have to say about this area?

238
00:27:06,971 --> 00:27:11,012
And then last night, we had a meeting where we had these initial designs.

239
00:27:11,192 --> 00:27:20,015
So these are the maps that our team put together and it shows like, here's where we're proposing a new bench, here's where we're proposing a new crosswalk, stuff like that.

240
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:25,216
And we presented this to folks both at the steering committee meeting and then the public meeting last night.

241
00:27:25,756 --> 00:27:31,798
And also had an option for people to type if they support an idea, don't support an idea, have a different idea.

242
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,260
So our next step is going through all those comments.

243
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,480
Yeah.

244
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:58,956
Yeah a lot of polling a lot of polling but it's so fun because I like reading all the comments because it like I'm on my computer, but I feel like they're telling me about their walk along the path and I'm like But following that meeting last night We now have a survey open that has all these pictures and walks you down the short line and shows you the different proposed ideas and so you can look at each chunk and put

245
00:27:59,536 --> 00:28:00,576
I think this, this, and this.

246
00:28:00,756 --> 00:28:01,897
I don't like this, this, and this.

247
00:28:01,917 --> 00:28:03,097
You can put that on the survey.

248
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:07,438
So that's our next phase, which is really awesome and really important to have everyone be a part of.

249
00:28:08,139 --> 00:28:10,979
And then we'll have a third set of meetings.

250
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:15,060
So it'll be about, we've gotten your feedback from our initial plan.

251
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:17,921
We've changed it a little bit based on people's input.

252
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:23,103
This is what we're finalizing and sending off to hopefully go to construction.

253
00:28:24,183 --> 00:28:34,350
It's a really cool process, but June will be our last set of meetings, and you should go to our website and learn all about this, and then we can sign you up for emails to get info about it.

254
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:35,971
Absolutely, absolutely.

255
00:28:36,092 --> 00:28:45,218
And it's really a wonderful opportunity to have your voice heard on all of what is being discussed.

256
00:28:45,624 --> 00:29:08,825
Yeah, and I will not forget, next week we're actually having an in-person option too, so if an online survey or meeting isn't the best, we're going to be on Thursday, April 24th, we're going to be at Duggar Park, or if it's raining, we'll be right in here, from 3.30 to 5.30, and we're going to have big maps out on the table with all this stuff, so you can just talk to us and we'll write down what you think.

257
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:16,528
And then Friday, April 25th, so a week from today, we're going to be at Shannon Beach in Winchester with the same thing.

258
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:21,450
And if that's a rainy day, we'll be at the Winchester Public Library from 4 to 515.

259
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,651
So write that down or go to our website.

260
00:29:24,911 --> 00:29:26,052
Very good, very good.

261
00:29:26,152 --> 00:29:30,014
So, and here's the $64,000 question.

262
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:45,605
It's probably a lot more now, but what does the current state of racial reckoning and a growing retreat from a healthy dialogue about diversity, equity, and inclusion mean for the support of environmental justice in our community?

263
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:55,048
That is a huge question, but so glad you asked that because I think it's so important for us to all be thinking about that right now.

264
00:29:55,068 --> 00:30:08,532
And my perspective is basically we have to just keep trucking and do what we can and just kind of like, you know, if we let the hopelessness sink in, then you're like, oh, I'm not going to go to this meeting.

265
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:09,092
I'm not going to,

266
00:30:09,612 --> 00:30:16,239
Go to the shoreline and because I'm like what's gonna make a difference, you know And that kind of attitude is just like for me.

267
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:18,502
It's not not how we get through.

268
00:30:18,522 --> 00:30:26,029
No, so I think this is a great example of like what can I do in my backyard my local river and

269
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:45,785
That has some importance and meaning to me and I can't control The country I can't control the decisions of some people but I can control My input in my own processes like this and I think it's important to get involved because it helps Inspire you and connect you with people which is what we all need right now

270
00:30:45,865 --> 00:30:47,026
Absolutely agree too.

271
00:30:47,126 --> 00:31:05,139
I think in anyone that has ever been out to, you know, count the herring or help deal with some of the, you know, the Japanese knotweed and all of these different invasive plants, you know, I think that that's the attitude that they've taken.

272
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:10,063
They've decided that they're not going to let

273
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:20,836
you know, the affairs of the day, and the constant clanging of the newsreel keep them from doing whatever they feel like they can do.

274
00:31:21,457 --> 00:31:39,485
And you, as an organization, giving them the opportunity to do these things is really a tonic for the spirit, because in a lot of instances, if there's no entity out there that you can kind of formally attach yourself to and say, okay, I'm with these guys over here,

275
00:31:40,005 --> 00:31:43,889
And we're doing X and Y and Z, and we're making a difference.

276
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:56,742
And I think that's one thing that Myra does extremely well, is it gives everybody a home base to come to and say, OK, well, we can go out and we can do this because Myra's going to be over here.

277
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:59,445
We can go out and we can do that because Myra's going to be over there.

278
00:31:59,905 --> 00:32:15,989
Definitely, and I would say also working with places like the center and with folks like you all and it's like that's what inspires us and keeps us going is having partnerships with amazing other local groups and thinking what they say like Think globally act locally.

279
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:16,569
Act locally.

280
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:17,689
That's what we do.

281
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,750
You know Tip O'Neill said it best.

282
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:24,711
He said all politics is local at the end of the day all politics is local so

283
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:33,553
even looking at it from a political perspective, we have to do what we can where we are.

284
00:32:35,094 --> 00:32:46,016
Oh, and speaking of which, I know that one of the platforms that you're diving off of right now, so to speak, is flood resilience.

285
00:32:46,777 --> 00:32:48,237
Would you talk a little bit about that?

286
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:50,439
Absolutely, yeah, thank you.

287
00:32:50,459 --> 00:33:01,471
So my job is to help support a lot of these projects with community input and stuff and also something that I've been working on in my role is looking at stormwater flooding in the Mystic.

288
00:33:01,551 --> 00:33:10,120
So that's a very early phases project and we're going to be working with the center and other folks across 10 different communities in the watershed

289
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:24,231
And basically our goal this summer is to just, similar to this process, reach out and find a bunch of people and have a big community party or something and get people talking about their experiences with flooding.

290
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:28,774
And it's like I said earlier, where obviously it's a long process.

291
00:33:28,794 --> 00:33:34,959
You have to be patient with what can we actually do about this when it comes to constructing stuff differently.

292
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,503
But something about my job is we're just in the information collection phase.

293
00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:54,810
So this summer I'm going to be going out to different places like the center and around different communities and talking to people about where they're seeing flooding and I think it's really it's really a good thing to do because it's like again community conversations is how you get people

294
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:06,200
mobilized and inspired, so I'm gonna bring back that information to my organization and push it forward again to, okay, now we've collected where all this flooding is happening, what can we do about it?

295
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:13,106
And that's something that I think is also just important, to keep gathering the information even if you don't know what you're doing.

296
00:34:13,386 --> 00:34:21,053
So I have a follow-up question to that because, you know, I'm, and maybe it's just ignorance on my part, but I'm,

297
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:36,699
not aware of this area having had issues with the rising tide of the river and having the water come over into the neighborhood.

298
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:41,920
Now, have you seen evidence of this in the past?

299
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,501
Yeah, I should clarify.

300
00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:48,925
So specifically for this project, we're looking at stormwater flooding.

301
00:34:49,305 --> 00:34:56,592
So when it's raining like crazy and your drains can't hold it all and it's coming up or it's like you have a street that doesn't have the right drainage.

302
00:34:57,212 --> 00:35:01,456
So we're not actually talking about the river overflowing its banks, so to speak.

303
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:04,139
We're not talking about that right now.

304
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,520
We should talk about it.

305
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:08,142
But yeah, it's all related, too.

306
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:09,442
That makes perfect sense to me.

307
00:35:09,542 --> 00:35:14,105
But if people have stories about that, we need to hear that, too, because it all is related.

308
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:15,806
It is, indeed.

309
00:35:16,386 --> 00:35:17,227
OK.

310
00:35:18,428 --> 00:35:23,290
So this is kind of a corollary to the first question.

311
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:30,475
We have a seeming denial, by many, of a lot of bedrock climate science.

312
00:35:31,735 --> 00:35:44,786
in the retreat from environmental protections and the aspiration toward dealing with these things better by the federal administration.

313
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:47,868
How does that kind of stuff impact your organization?

314
00:35:48,565 --> 00:36:04,538
Yeah, so the way that I think is really helpful for me to think about it is when we're talking about climate change, so taboo sometimes, it's really helpful for me to phrase it without saying like, we're talking about climate resilience today.

315
00:36:04,558 --> 00:36:07,860
I just say we're talking about flooding or extreme heat.

316
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,243
Because even if you're talking to people who are a little bit more like,

317
00:36:11,863 --> 00:36:13,404
oh, I don't know if I believe in this.

318
00:36:14,124 --> 00:36:18,646
It's like, do you believe that you're really hot this summer and it hasn't been this hot before?

319
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:29,091
But just because we don't have to draw it back to the science if people don't wanna do that, you can say, okay, the river is eroding or you're not seeing as much birds.

320
00:36:29,511 --> 00:36:35,694
There's stuff that you don't have to say is climate but people can relate to and kinda gets the gears turning.

321
00:36:35,734 --> 00:36:36,975
That's what's helpful for me at least.

322
00:36:37,735 --> 00:37:00,386
So it ends up in a lot of instances being kind of terminology and how you approach it in terms of whether you talk to folks so that those who are, whether it's on the fence or whether they're outright deniers or whatever, they can kind of relate to it in terms that don't require them to think that, you know, there's an engineer up there who's trying to make them do stuff they don't want to do.

323
00:37:00,746 --> 00:37:01,707
Absolutely, yeah.

324
00:37:02,527 --> 00:37:03,947
Very good, very good.

325
00:37:04,287 --> 00:37:12,449
Okay, so I like to do this with my guests and hopefully we can play.

326
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:15,650
So I want to play a little game of word association.

327
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,130
Okay.

328
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:26,272
Okay, and what I would like to do is I want to give you a word-word phrase and ask you to please give me a few sentences on what that word-word phrase means to you.

329
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:26,632
Okay.

330
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:27,773
All right.

331
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:33,785
So, you know, and we've actually heard a couple of these words during the course of our conversation tonight.

332
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:38,755
But so when you hear the term invasive species, what do you think about?

333
00:37:39,218 --> 00:37:46,566
Okay, I think of like an evil monster that's like crawling and climbing and vining and wrapping around.

334
00:37:46,586 --> 00:37:51,210
Because the way it wraps around native plants, it can literally choke out.

335
00:37:51,591 --> 00:37:58,998
Like when I worked at the farm last year, beautiful stalks of corn getting suffocated by this vine and it's like, it's like a monster.

336
00:37:59,419 --> 00:38:00,300
And what was the vine?

337
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:03,103
I'm so bad.

338
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:07,586
It might be bittersweet fine, but I'm not the scientist.

339
00:38:07,646 --> 00:38:09,227
It's scary, it's scary.

340
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,350
All right, but physically choking out corn.

341
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,872
Yeah, it's scary, like a tentacle.

342
00:38:15,132 --> 00:38:20,516
Wow, sounds like wrestling or something like that.

343
00:38:20,616 --> 00:38:24,279
Okay, so jet skis.

344
00:38:27,379 --> 00:38:39,444
I think jet skis are really fun for like Cancun or something, but I understand that maybe they're not what a lot of people want to see on their neighborhood river.

345
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:42,825
Yeah, kind of overpowering for the Mystic Lakes.

346
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:53,413
It might be, and actually my friend has a cat named Jetski because he's fast and dangerous, so I have to plug him too.

347
00:38:53,673 --> 00:38:57,016
Okay, okay.

348
00:38:57,116 --> 00:38:58,677
Your namesake, Shannon Beach.

349
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:12,258
Oh, so my dad grew up in Arlington and he always tells us stories about how after his dinners when he was like 10, his great uncle or whatever would make him walk around the entire Mystic Lakes.

350
00:39:13,338 --> 00:39:18,640
So I've had a lot of funny stories about Shannon Beach and I remember it used to be called Sandy Beach.

351
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,200
Absolutely.

352
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,902
And I remember when they changed it, one of my other uncles was like, hey, you know, they called it Shannon Beach.

353
00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:24,542
I was like, what?

354
00:39:25,622 --> 00:39:27,162
But everyone else is kind of mad about it.

355
00:39:27,302 --> 00:39:46,106
Yeah, well, everybody down here for sure was mad about it because, you know, that was we had always grown up with Sandy Beach and we didn't always have great stories about it because, you know, like when I was young, you know, we we got harassed and hassled sometimes, you know, going down to the beach because, you know, we look like everybody else.

356
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:48,026
But but we got over it.

357
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,147
We dealt with it, you know.

358
00:39:49,627 --> 00:39:49,967
OK.

359
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:51,367
Herring run.

360
00:39:52,398 --> 00:39:55,282
Oh, the herring run.

361
00:39:55,302 --> 00:39:58,926
I will admit, I have not been to see the herring.

362
00:39:59,307 --> 00:40:00,688
So I just started in November.

363
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:04,212
But I think it's one of the coolest things that my organization does.

364
00:40:05,434 --> 00:40:10,299
And I think it's so incredible because we've gotten like the biggest count in New England now, I think.

365
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:19,806
So, and I think it's an incredible story of, like, there's so many beautiful indigenous stories about it, like, just the history of, like, the herring, it's incredible.

366
00:40:19,846 --> 00:40:23,228
But I haven't actually seen it, so that's on my list for, like, this month.

367
00:40:23,268 --> 00:40:36,917
Well, it's so, and the other thing is, it's so connective, connected to the history of, you know, kind of Native Americans in the area, because it was obviously a, you know, a great, you know, food source and food resource.

368
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:50,800
But it also, you know, just brings back all of the stories of how the natives really, really wanted initially to share the land and to be, you know, good neighbors.

369
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:55,321
And they were already good stewards and they already knew how to farm and fish and all of that.

370
00:40:56,842 --> 00:41:00,923
And things didn't work out, you know, very well in their favor.

371
00:41:02,004 --> 00:41:21,385
Also a beautiful story about resilience though because like as we keep connecting more and more fish ladders and stuff Yeah, it brings back the history and the fish remember the way, you know Well, I you know, I like the fact that you have so many people that come out to do this particular thing, you know when you have the

372
00:41:22,185 --> 00:41:31,311
the herring runs and you issue the call for folks to come out and count the fish, it's really cool that you have literally hundreds of people that wanna come out and count fish.

373
00:41:31,351 --> 00:41:35,333
Yeah, and the volunteer slots filled up in three days.

374
00:41:35,614 --> 00:41:37,735
Yeah, that's what I mean, it's pretty crazy.

375
00:41:37,755 --> 00:41:38,776
It's pretty crazy.

376
00:41:39,476 --> 00:41:49,202
Okay, so what should folks in our audience and in the watershed absolutely know about Myra?

377
00:41:49,977 --> 00:41:53,698
Okay, I would say you should know that you're always welcome.

378
00:41:53,898 --> 00:42:01,900
So go online and find an email and just email someone if you're interested in their project or like our offices are right in Arlington Center.

379
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,441
Show up there, write us a letter, whatever you want to do.

380
00:42:04,881 --> 00:42:12,463
Just come talk to us and we're always willing to hear your stories related to the river, the environment, hear your concerns.

381
00:42:13,103 --> 00:42:16,146
And it really is a community-driven organization.

382
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:23,032
We have grown so much because of all the power of the community and the new partnerships we've made and stuff.

383
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,995
So just find a way or find one thing you're interested in.

384
00:42:26,055 --> 00:42:33,182
If it's fish, trash, climate, anything, just find your way and someone will love to talk to you and get you involved.

385
00:42:33,682 --> 00:42:52,937
So they, and I'm not sure how it came into their possession, but the organization got this big old Victorian house off of Pleasant Street in Arlington, and it's really, really cool because it's like you're at work and at home at the same time.

386
00:42:54,698 --> 00:43:02,985
I've been there a couple of times for our meetings and such, and even going to the restroom or whatever,

387
00:43:03,345 --> 00:43:05,547
It's very much like being in your own home.

388
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:09,811
It's not at all like a business building, but it's real nice.

389
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:11,693
And they're very, very open and welcoming.

390
00:43:11,753 --> 00:43:22,663
So just like if you walked through the front door and said, what's what, they would take the time to hang out with you and show you around and talk to you about whatever you wanted to talk about.

391
00:43:22,783 --> 00:43:23,604
So it's real nice.

392
00:43:23,624 --> 00:43:23,924
Absolutely.

393
00:43:24,504 --> 00:43:24,705
Yeah.

394
00:43:25,105 --> 00:43:27,027
OK, so I want to give you the last word.

395
00:43:27,868 --> 00:43:29,109
What are your parting thoughts?

396
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:53,136
Okay parting thoughts are I'm just already feeling so inspired from this conversation and I hope you guys are all feeling a little awakened with the spring and everything happening and I think for me nature is one of like the best ways to just like re-center yourself with everything else we're dealing with right now like just go sit on the shoreline and you know

397
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:57,880
Whatever you want to do like get together with a neighbor like right now.

398
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:05,467
We need that more than ever So just get outside talk to someone you'll feel better all right, very good, so I

399
00:44:07,683 --> 00:44:19,413
Shannon, really thank you so much for bringing a broad perspective and really fantastic organizational and ecological insight into this community in greater Medford.

400
00:44:20,233 --> 00:44:25,858
Obviously it's important work that Myra does and I hope that folks all over Medford

401
00:44:26,253 --> 00:44:34,900
will become increasingly more aware of the watershed's importance, of its equity as a resource, and its health and safekeeping.

402
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:46,290
And to everyone that's been watching in the room, obviously, and also out there in TV land, as they used to call it, thanks so much for your attentiveness and your interest in our discussion.

403
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:54,877
And thanks for coming along with us as we continue to refresh for greater flexibility and bringing the best stories and entertainment possible.

404
00:44:55,417 --> 00:45:11,371
So get ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin right after we take a break to reset our stage, and I'll come back and share some WMCC announcements, and then we'll get started with the music portion of Words and Music.

405
00:45:11,471 --> 00:45:12,171
Thank you, Shannon.

406
00:45:12,311 --> 00:45:12,992
Thank you.

407
00:45:14,033 --> 00:45:14,453
Thank you.

408
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:16,715
All right.

409
00:50:22,578 --> 00:50:23,359
Okay, very good.

410
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:25,901
Check, check.

411
00:50:27,002 --> 00:50:29,864
Okay.

412
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:31,986
All right.

413
00:50:33,607 --> 00:50:34,007
Here we go.

414
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:37,090
Here we go.

415
00:50:39,212 --> 00:50:39,492
All right.

416
00:50:42,695 --> 00:50:43,816
Boom, boom, boom.

417
00:50:51,472 --> 00:50:51,993
All righty.

418
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:53,654
We're about ready.

419
00:50:54,035 --> 00:50:54,756
We're about ready.

420
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:00,101
OK.

421
00:51:00,902 --> 00:51:01,182
We're good?

422
00:51:01,423 --> 00:51:01,523
OK.

423
00:51:05,154 --> 00:51:07,495
I wait to get my high sign from my man back there.

424
00:51:07,715 --> 00:51:18,357
Okay, so more often than not, and I'm going to hold off to the end with all the promotional stuff and so forth, because I want to get into this.

425
00:51:18,977 --> 00:51:29,640
More often than not, when we do Words in Music, we go out there and we beat the bushes and we find wonderful singers and we find, you know,

426
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,562
outstanding musicians.

427
00:51:31,842 --> 00:51:44,534
We, you know, we've got, you know, we're looped into the Berkeley community and the New England Conservatory community, and we get some amazing folks to come in, you know, and do stuff for us.

428
00:51:45,795 --> 00:51:47,137
But it's Poetry Month.

429
00:51:48,253 --> 00:51:56,196
And my bishop, my pastor, would say to us all the time, he would say, it's a sorry frog that won't praise his own pond.

430
00:51:57,377 --> 00:52:01,359
So I'm calling my own number tonight.

431
00:52:02,179 --> 00:52:07,141
But, and I'm fortunate in this, I'm not doing it by myself.

432
00:52:07,641 --> 00:52:15,304
Several years ago, I had the outrageous fortune to link up with this guy.

433
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:16,745
His name is Jonathan Fagan.

434
00:52:18,695 --> 00:52:19,095
Okay.

435
00:52:19,835 --> 00:52:30,179
And, you know, John kind of heard it through the grapevine that, you know, there was this poet guy out there doing some stuff that, you know, he kind of liked.

436
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:38,643
And we talked, and one thing led to another, and we started talking about a collaboration.

437
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:43,985
And the collaboration became what's known as the Ally Project.

438
00:52:45,085 --> 00:53:03,656
And the ally part is obviously a throw to the fact that we were both seeking a way to make poetry and music address some of the social justice issues that we both really feel very strongly about.

439
00:53:04,297 --> 00:53:06,418
And that's what it became.

440
00:53:06,498 --> 00:53:13,362
And it became that to the effect that we developed this quartet

441
00:53:14,103 --> 00:53:16,668
And that's Greg Toro on the bass back there.

442
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:31,090
And our first drummer, John Dalton, real busy guy, doing a bunch of different stuff, and not always available to us.

443
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:42,833
But because Jonathan knows like a million musicians, he was able to find a great drummer that could step into John's shoes.

444
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:46,413
And we literally never missed a beat.

445
00:53:46,713 --> 00:53:49,074
So back here is Gordon Angleguy.

446
00:53:51,224 --> 00:54:08,613
Okay, and it was cool because we, you know, Jonathan is also the founder of the Medford Jazz Festival, which has been going on for several years now, in which we've had for the past three or four years, here at the community center right out in our backyard.

447
00:54:09,214 --> 00:54:20,180
And this summer it's gonna be in August, I think it's the 16th and the 17th, and it's a don't miss thing, because this kind of stuff just doesn't happen in West Medford very often.

448
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:36,214
You want to be able to, you know, we set about 60 or 70 chairs back in the back, and the sun is shining, and oh man, it's a great atmosphere, and it's August, so it's still nice and warm and sunny.

449
00:54:36,954 --> 00:54:40,359
So it's a Saturday and a Sunday afternoon, and it's free.

450
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:48,411
And you got access to Duggar Park, and there's refreshments, and we have a big time.

451
00:54:48,491 --> 00:54:50,534
So hopefully, you'll do that.

452
00:54:50,594 --> 00:54:51,375
But anyways.

453
00:54:53,398 --> 00:54:59,600
we've been playing together for several years now, and we actually, we cut a record.

454
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:05,982
So over there on the table is a CD, if anybody still has a CD player, it's crazy.

455
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,743
And it's called the Ally Project.

456
00:55:08,783 --> 00:55:19,346
So a lot of what we do tonight, and there's some new stuff too, because I'm working on my seventh book, but a lot of it is actually on that CD.

457
00:55:21,107 --> 00:55:30,372
So, Greg Toro, Gordon Engelgau, Jonathan Fagan, I'm Terry Cotter, and we are the Allied Project.

458
00:55:31,052 --> 00:55:31,393
All right?

459
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,253
Can we play for you?

460
00:55:33,374 --> 00:55:34,174
All right, let's do it.

461
00:55:35,675 --> 00:55:36,175
Okay, John.

462
00:55:36,836 --> 00:55:38,176
Okay.

463
00:55:38,216 --> 00:55:42,378
This first piece we're going to do is called Hired by the Mystic.

464
00:55:42,459 --> 00:55:46,201
And for me, as a poet in West Medford, this is kind of where it all started.

465
00:55:47,421 --> 00:55:48,902
So, hopefully you'll enjoy it.

466
00:55:51,902 --> 00:55:57,688
They gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it, just a few streets hard by the river.

467
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:03,435
Banks turned a blind eye behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money.

468
00:56:04,616 --> 00:56:07,839
Class was an irresistible force.

469
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,962
Race was an immovable object.

470
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:28,814
Perhaps it wasn't the written rule, but white folks knew the legal tool to keep us in our place in this mystic valley space, where slaves and rum and ships had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money.

471
00:56:30,535 --> 00:56:40,263
So it was hard by the mystic we went, muddy and a bit turned down, the only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town.

472
00:56:42,186 --> 00:56:46,827
But we named it, we claimed it, we made it our own.

473
00:56:48,747 --> 00:56:57,089
Even in the heat of summer when the shores were parched and the soil was rank with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river.

474
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:02,711
We followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beachfront.

475
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:08,432
On our own Jordan shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ.

476
00:57:09,378 --> 00:57:17,981
We caught the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread and became the teeming multitude who our Lord Jesus fed, hired by the mystic.

477
00:57:21,803 --> 00:57:24,404
We became community.

478
00:57:24,424 --> 00:57:25,825
We commanded unity.

479
00:57:27,525 --> 00:57:31,627
We embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go.

480
00:57:37,902 --> 00:57:42,965
As the river ebbs and flows, the tides will turn and our fortune grows.

481
00:57:43,385 --> 00:57:45,286
A few more streets become our home.

482
00:57:45,626 --> 00:57:48,387
Houses on Sharon join Kin on Jerome.

483
00:57:50,488 --> 00:57:55,250
From Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the white folks make more room for blacks.

484
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,712
The color line recedes a bit.

485
00:57:58,212 --> 00:58:01,033
Church and school and center fit.

486
00:58:01,694 --> 00:58:06,176
The Ville becomes the heart of it, hard by the mystic shore.

487
00:58:10,043 --> 00:58:16,048
Now the worm has surely learned and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same.

488
00:58:17,909 --> 00:58:20,211
That muddy mystic most days is clean.

489
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:23,633
The banks are freshly cut and green.

490
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:29,218
Faces once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town.

491
00:58:51,620 --> 00:59:09,867
These streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defines, condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, egress, invest, and dispossess.

492
00:59:12,588 --> 00:59:15,889
Now those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city.

493
00:59:16,569 --> 00:59:23,151
And sometimes that success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan friends.

494
00:59:32,794 --> 00:59:39,696
And yet, the river still turns and bends from where it begins to where it ends.

495
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:46,694
the only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town.

496
00:59:48,555 --> 00:59:56,141
But we named it, we claimed it, and made it our own.

497
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:03,226
Very good.

498
01:00:03,847 --> 01:00:04,327
Very good.

499
01:00:06,845 --> 01:00:18,412
So when I'm feeling nostalgic, I always go back to living in West Medford.

500
01:00:18,512 --> 01:00:21,453
I live in Randolph now.

501
01:00:21,513 --> 01:00:25,295
When my wife and I first got married, and we've been married almost 38 years now,

502
01:00:28,877 --> 01:00:36,559
The first five years that we were married, we lived on Arlington Street in a rental apartment that some friends of my family had.

503
01:00:37,499 --> 01:00:40,200
And loved it here in West Medford.

504
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:48,062
But she was working for, actually for Boston Water and Sewer at the time, and they pressed the residency requirement.

505
01:00:48,642 --> 01:00:51,603
And she was six months from getting grandfathered.

506
01:00:52,723 --> 01:00:55,944
So we had to move into Boston in order for her to keep her job.

507
01:00:57,085 --> 01:00:58,025
She liked her job.

508
01:00:58,305 --> 01:00:59,766
I liked her liking her job.

509
01:01:00,206 --> 01:01:02,627
So, you know, so we moved.

510
01:01:03,227 --> 01:01:04,888
And we moved to Dorchester.

511
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:10,230
And we lived in two different apartments in Dorchester for about 17 years.

512
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:19,193
And then it was, you know, when we thought that we had all of our ducks in a row to be able to buy a house, we came back to Medford first to look.

513
01:01:19,934 --> 01:01:20,494
Couldn't touch it.

514
01:01:21,314 --> 01:01:21,834
Couldn't touch it.

515
01:01:23,155 --> 01:01:24,375
So we started looking.

516
01:01:24,795 --> 01:01:27,196
We looked in Boston for like that long.

517
01:01:28,637 --> 01:01:35,440
But you could touch, if you couldn't touch Medford, you definitely couldn't touch Boston, especially in the areas where we, that we were interested in.

518
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:40,021
And we started looking south and we had some friends in Randolph.

519
01:01:40,101 --> 01:01:43,183
We started looking in Randolph and we finally found a nice place.

520
01:01:43,263 --> 01:01:48,365
We have a nice little split level ranch with a big yard in Randolph and that's home.

521
01:01:49,065 --> 01:01:49,325
But

522
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:52,608
Home is where the heart is, obviously.

523
01:01:53,208 --> 01:02:02,410
So again, whenever I want to reminisce and think back to the good old days, I come back to my West Medford home.

524
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:07,112
And I work here during the week, and it keeps me connected.

525
01:02:07,452 --> 01:02:14,834
And the beauty of it is that my mother, my father, and my baby brother all had cancer, and they passed away.

526
01:02:16,374 --> 01:02:18,035
And I had it, but I beat it.

527
01:02:19,415 --> 01:02:20,659
You know, God is good.

528
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:23,887
And they're looking down on me and I hope they're proud of me.

529
01:02:24,288 --> 01:02:24,869
But anyways.

530
01:02:27,022 --> 01:02:40,510
It gave me an opportunity, coming back to work at the community center, to be in West Medford, to be with my family, to go through some of what they were going through, and to be there as a resource for them while they were going through it.

531
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:46,093
So, you know, they say, never curse the bridge that brought you safely over.

532
01:02:46,653 --> 01:02:49,335
So I never, never curse West Medford.

533
01:02:50,235 --> 01:02:57,281
But I do care some of the things that have happened to West Medford that have made it less West Medford for a lot of folks.

534
01:02:58,062 --> 01:02:59,943
So this is a little bit of that.

535
01:03:00,304 --> 01:03:01,164
I'm not mad.

536
01:03:01,705 --> 01:03:02,686
I'm just truthful.

537
01:03:03,006 --> 01:03:04,447
This is called Corner Lot.

538
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:07,610
Okay.

539
01:03:08,671 --> 01:03:10,652
Getting a little bit of fuzzy fuzzy.

540
01:03:11,053 --> 01:03:11,353
Okay.

541
01:03:11,613 --> 01:03:11,913
We good?

542
01:03:12,154 --> 01:03:12,514
We better?

543
01:03:12,774 --> 01:03:12,994
Okay.

544
01:03:13,935 --> 01:03:14,235
Okay.

545
01:03:15,837 --> 01:03:16,117
Thank you.

546
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:48,073
standing at the apex of Arlington and Jerome, trying to remember the black and the brown and the tan.

547
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:52,395
Ronnie and Otis used to live in the big house on the corner lot.

548
01:03:53,175 --> 01:03:56,096
It's probably changed hands half a dozen times since then.

549
01:03:57,737 --> 01:03:59,418
Current owner's been there for a minute.

550
01:04:00,098 --> 01:04:03,440
He's good with his hands and knows his way around wood and tools.

551
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,981
Place has been gussied up quite a bit.

552
01:04:07,021 --> 01:04:10,303
Picket fence is off-white, but if you know, you know.

553
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:22,781
Asian kid in a Tufts hoodie just whipped by in a helmet and rollerblades.

554
01:04:23,682 --> 01:04:25,562
Didn't see much of that back in the day.

555
01:04:26,542 --> 01:04:31,644
The university sort of hit on a hillside trying its best to be a baby Ivy.

556
01:04:32,404 --> 01:04:34,545
But the cohorts come here all the time now.

557
01:04:35,085 --> 01:04:43,147
Basketballs, tennis rackets, and pickleball paddles in tow on bikes, benzos, and rollerblades.

558
01:04:44,645 --> 01:04:50,146
We used to bust ourselves up pretty good on rickety metal skates with clunky keys and leather straps.

559
01:04:51,006 --> 01:04:54,347
Nothing a little Vaseline and Mercura comb couldn't handle.

560
01:04:55,347 --> 01:04:57,188
How did Henley put it in Invictus?

561
01:04:57,728 --> 01:05:00,028
Oh yeah, bloodied but unbowed.

562
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:10,891
Not too many white and off-white kids hanging out down here back then.

563
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:18,312
It was as if the invisible lines once drawn to keep us in sometimes kept other folks out too.

564
01:05:20,474 --> 01:05:22,036
Now they've pretty much taken over.

565
01:05:22,656 --> 01:05:31,924
Duggar Park, the Rhone Tennis Courts, the Hervey Schoolyard, and a hundred addresses on Arlington, Lincoln, and Jerome.

566
01:05:32,905 --> 01:05:37,449
A host of our remembered places, so few of our original faces.

567
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:53,840
Meanwhile, back at Ronnie and Otis's old place, I'm still standing like that centurion, knowing that Jesus doesn't have to go in to heal his servant.

568
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,022
He just has to speak a word.

569
01:05:57,482 --> 01:06:04,947
I keep hoping that he'll speak a word to the Cornelot, too, and bring back the black and the brown and the tan.

570
01:06:09,573 --> 01:06:11,314
Across the street is the river.

571
01:06:12,174 --> 01:06:16,275
It's low tide, but the smell is gone and the grass is greener than I recall.

572
01:06:23,237 --> 01:06:27,818
That was our little park, away from Duggar and a lot less hectic.

573
01:06:28,198 --> 01:06:32,719
We had makeshift bases or discarded cones for football and softball.

574
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:38,561
We lost a few in the river, but nobody was going in that muck to retrieve anything.

575
01:06:39,937 --> 01:06:42,098
We'd probably wade in that water today.

576
01:06:44,139 --> 01:06:46,640
They planted some trees there many years ago.

577
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:48,880
They're all pretty big now.

578
01:06:49,781 --> 01:06:51,521
Maple and ash, I think.

579
01:06:52,602 --> 01:06:55,403
Nobody plays baseball or football there anymore.

580
01:06:56,243 --> 01:07:06,367
But there are lots of dogs frolicking off leash and gaggles of fat geese daring pitties, pugs, and poodles to chase them off.

581
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:20,036
I can't imagine my childhood without losing a few softballs there.

582
01:07:20,056 --> 01:07:32,251
I can't imagine not hearing Mrs. Allen calling James Michael to come eat, or little Charlie watching us play from his folding chair, because his spindly legs were too weak to let him run.

583
01:07:33,725 --> 01:07:36,666
I can't imagine that I'm still here.

584
01:07:37,446 --> 01:07:45,049
But Ronnie and Otis, Darryl King, Frankie French, Aaron McDaniel, and Marky Davis are all gone.

585
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:49,971
Everyone had a nickname back then.

586
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:54,193
Darryl was super fast, so we called him Road Runner and Jack Rabbit.

587
01:07:55,258 --> 01:08:00,423
Mark was thick as a big tree trunk, so we came up with oak for him.

588
01:08:00,983 --> 01:08:05,507
Aaron was bud, Frankie was fruit man, and I was top cat.

589
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:07,789
Too cool, ran the school.

590
01:08:14,175 --> 01:08:16,117
Everyone wants the corner lot.

591
01:08:16,877 --> 01:08:21,582
Little more land, and perhaps the new perspectives that angles create.

592
01:08:22,758 --> 01:08:30,383
I wonder if that meant anything to Ronnie and Otis, or Jed and Miles and Gib, Barry, Coco, Keith Wing, and Kenny Byfield.

593
01:08:32,085 --> 01:08:38,189
It certainly meant something to the white folks looking to displace, transplant, and uproot the local color.

594
01:08:40,531 --> 01:08:51,899
Black folks built homes here, only place where we were allowed to be, where they could color inside the lines Medford once drew against the perceived discomforts of darker skin.

595
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:55,850
We were here first.

596
01:08:56,791 --> 01:09:06,595
First firefighters, police officers, war heroes, shop owners, tradesmen, postal chiefs, teachers, artists, and preachers.

597
01:09:08,096 --> 01:09:12,417
We were the human bedrock of the only neighborhood they'd let us build.

598
01:09:16,639 --> 01:09:18,020
The old church is gone.

599
01:09:18,961 --> 01:09:25,525
Nelson even changed the street number as if to erase the fact that the original Shiloh Baptist ever existed.

600
01:09:29,867 --> 01:09:31,948
But if you know, you know.

601
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:37,231
That corner lot still has a cornerstone.

602
01:09:37,251 --> 01:09:37,231
1900.

603
01:09:37,512 --> 01:09:43,595
And Nelson couldn't do nothing about it without a more draconian demolition.

604
01:09:45,580 --> 01:10:00,839
two more condos in the house of the Lord, two more houses that us first folk can't afford, two more dismissals of the blessing of his word, one more holy stone rejected and ignored.

605
01:10:13,782 --> 01:10:16,764
Okay, nostalgia is hard sometimes, whew.

606
01:10:17,544 --> 01:10:22,788
Okay, so, but it's also happy sometimes, so that's what this next piece is about.

607
01:10:23,168 --> 01:10:27,531
And you may have heard it before, but you're getting ready to hear it once again more.

608
01:10:29,192 --> 01:10:29,552
Okay.

609
01:10:33,115 --> 01:10:33,375
Okay.

610
01:10:34,776 --> 01:10:35,396
Thank you.

611
01:10:37,698 --> 01:10:39,819
The Little Store, you're right there.

612
01:10:42,035 --> 01:10:42,396
All right.

613
01:10:42,837 --> 01:10:43,217
Good, good.

614
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:44,820
Okay.

615
01:10:58,737 --> 01:11:00,999
It was a tiny red hovel on Upper Jerome.

616
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:04,082
A bit run down and rough around the edges.

617
01:11:05,143 --> 01:11:13,090
And Mr. Henry seemed so old to us, even then, with a lot of whiskers, impatient and a little scary.

618
01:11:14,231 --> 01:11:16,633
One would suspect that he didn't even like kids.

619
01:11:17,814 --> 01:11:20,036
But he really must have loved us.

620
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:25,680
Or else, where did all that penny candy come from?

621
01:11:26,803 --> 01:11:28,705
He had all of it, no seriously.

622
01:11:30,046 --> 01:11:35,491
We'd bust in there with a few nickels or a handful of pennies, all loud and unruly.

623
01:11:35,511 --> 01:11:40,135
He'd hush us up while he finished up with grown folks' business.

624
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:44,940
Then he'd be back, like a black Willy Wonka up in that old shack.

625
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:50,565
He'd peer over those old horn-rimmed glasses and tell us he didn't have all day.

626
01:11:52,727 --> 01:12:04,876
Then he'd blow open one of those small brown craft paper bags and get to stuffing while we were oohing and aahing and huffing and puffing.

627
01:12:06,217 --> 01:12:12,742
See, Mr. Henry had all the treats, all of our favorites, a hundred great sweets.

628
01:12:13,968 --> 01:12:22,897
root beer barrels and pixie stip, squirrel nut zippers and banana splits, green mint juleps and button strips, red licorice ropes and bottle nips.

629
01:12:23,317 --> 01:12:33,186
He had bazooka Joe bubblegum and a tiny sucker called a dum-dum, jawbreakers and tootsie rolls, sugary love for little kids' souls.

630
01:12:33,887 --> 01:12:38,570
Candy necklaces to wear and bite, and waxy red lips was such a sight.

631
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:44,313
Fat gum cigars and kids cigarettes, right beside the crunchy six-lets.

632
01:12:45,214 --> 01:12:49,396
Mary Jane chewies and BB bats, hot fireballs and Mexican hats.

633
01:12:50,117 --> 01:12:55,640
Just the genuine Hershey's kisses, all the hits and none of the misses.

634
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:07,211
Like kits, taffy squares, and Necco wafers, liquor made in Boston baked beans, gold rocks, nuggets of gum in a bag, a kid's idea, sweet to swag.

635
01:13:09,133 --> 01:13:12,917
Before the days of Laffy Taffys, we would gobble up peppermint patties.

636
01:13:13,257 --> 01:13:17,902
Before we knew about gummy bears, Twizzlers always came in pairs.

637
01:13:19,232 --> 01:13:23,414
Chewy cow tails had a creamy filling, but sugar babies had top billing.

638
01:13:23,854 --> 01:13:28,335
Reese's peanut butter cups had us squealing like newborn pups.

639
01:13:29,236 --> 01:13:34,077
Mike and Ikes and orange slices, saltwater taffy and tiny prices.

640
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:40,580
Lifesavers and charms and fruity flavors, we grabbed those bags like potty favors.

641
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,883
Chuckles were a favorite choice, and Milk Duds made us all rejoice.

642
01:13:45,283 --> 01:13:50,667
Jolly Ranchers and Bitter Honey, we always got a lot for our money.

643
01:13:55,051 --> 01:13:57,612
Talk about kids getting excited.

644
01:13:58,053 --> 01:14:00,415
You can't imagine the flame he ignited.

645
01:14:00,815 --> 01:14:05,859
Our greedy fingers could barely wait to take that candy like fish take bait.

646
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:14,492
From cold January to chilly December, more kinds of candy than I can remember.

647
01:14:15,152 --> 01:14:20,494
At the Ville storefront on Upper Jerome, I knew I had to write this poem.

648
01:14:21,414 --> 01:14:30,257
See, Mr. Henry had all the treats, all of our favorites, 100 great sweets.

649
01:14:31,417 --> 01:14:33,318
Yeah, a little nicer, a little nicer.

650
01:14:33,598 --> 01:14:34,939
OK, very good.

651
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:36,399
Where we going, Jenny?

652
01:14:39,357 --> 01:14:41,257
Yes, yes, absolutely.

653
01:14:43,338 --> 01:14:43,758
Okay.

654
01:14:47,238 --> 01:14:55,800
So in many ways, we as a country are in a bit of a crisis.

655
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:07,322
And unless you were Massachusetts, Pawtucket,

656
01:15:08,864 --> 01:15:14,066
Nipmuck, Wampanoag, in this area, you came from someplace else.

657
01:15:15,126 --> 01:15:19,148
So this piece is called Beloved Country, and you'll get it.

658
01:15:34,274 --> 01:15:35,654
Ah, pat it now, kid.

659
01:15:35,934 --> 01:15:37,855
I love it.

660
01:16:09,617 --> 01:16:10,978
I can love this country, too.

661
01:16:11,998 --> 01:16:14,399
I didn't have to be born on these barney shores.

662
01:16:15,220 --> 01:16:19,022
I didn't have to be a son of the Pentacook, Quinnipiac, or Mohican.

663
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:24,464
I didn't have to have a pilgrim pedigree or be a Connecticut Yankee from King Arthur's Corps.

664
01:16:25,565 --> 01:16:31,868
I can be the Dahomey, the Pole, or the child of Caribbean suns in Amazon shade.

665
01:16:33,698 --> 01:16:35,260
I can love this country too.

666
01:16:36,281 --> 01:16:40,026
My green card was a welcome ticket to a new life in a new land.

667
01:16:41,107 --> 01:16:44,150
My passport was stamped with new hopes and new dreams.

668
01:16:44,991 --> 01:16:50,978
My suitcases were packed full with new aspirations and some apprehensions too.

669
01:16:53,395 --> 01:16:59,780
Perhaps I didn't see the harbor sign that said, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.

670
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:05,324
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore, send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me.

671
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:10,988
I lift my lamp beside the golden door.

672
01:17:11,408 --> 01:17:20,154
Perhaps I didn't see the lady in the lamp, but I did see the gleaming city on a hill that couldn't be hid, and my soul responded.

673
01:17:26,227 --> 01:17:27,528
I can love this country too.

674
01:17:28,388 --> 01:17:31,130
I can love its rolling meadows and its gospel songs.

675
01:17:31,931 --> 01:17:35,873
I can love its asphalt highways and its born-to-run boss.

676
01:17:36,854 --> 01:17:40,756
I can love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl.

677
01:17:41,497 --> 01:17:46,440
I can love its old spires, new minarets, and golden menorahs.

678
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:04,944
But can America love me too?

679
01:18:06,065 --> 01:18:09,286
Can she love my curry spices, roti, and oxtails?

680
01:18:10,207 --> 01:18:12,829
Can she love my hijab and henna tattoos?

681
01:18:13,509 --> 01:18:16,891
Can she love my Hajj, my Mecca, and my Medina?

682
01:18:17,892 --> 01:18:21,114
Can she love my Cinco de Mayo and Dia de los Muertos?

683
01:18:22,114 --> 01:18:26,137
Can she love my kente cloth, dredge, twist, and locks?

684
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:29,681
Can she love the skin I'm in?

685
01:18:30,441 --> 01:18:35,282
Be it ebony, ivory, dulce de leche, or cafe au lait.

686
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:39,984
Can she love me by name?

687
01:18:40,644 --> 01:18:49,046
Chicana Glory, Muhammad bin Said, Anastasia Kozov, Cleophis Dorsey, or Claudia Gonzalez.

688
01:18:49,106 --> 01:18:51,547
Can she love me by name?

689
01:18:57,350 --> 01:19:03,494
And what if I am among those huddled masses in that wretched refuge or that homeless, tempest-tossed?

690
01:19:04,355 --> 01:19:06,497
Will she continue to lift her lamp?

691
01:19:08,758 --> 01:19:22,848
Or do war and rumors of war, IEDs, sleeper cells, and faith distortions make me a pariah to be eliminated, a scourge to be annihilated, and a plague to be exterminated?

692
01:19:31,284 --> 01:19:32,145
I come in peace.

693
01:19:34,568 --> 01:19:35,849
And I love this country too.

694
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:39,293
I love its boundless opportunity.

695
01:19:39,873 --> 01:19:41,915
I love its generosity of spirit.

696
01:19:42,456 --> 01:19:44,778
I love the audacity of its hope.

697
01:19:45,459 --> 01:19:48,362
I love its rolling meadows and its joyful songs.

698
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:53,247
I love its asphalt highways and its little red Corvette.

699
01:19:54,350 --> 01:19:57,392
I love its teeming ghetto and its urban sprawl.

700
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:03,096
I love its old spires, new minarets, and golden menorahs.

701
01:20:03,356 --> 01:20:06,759
I come in peace.

702
01:20:23,423 --> 01:20:27,746
And I love America too.

703
01:20:28,626 --> 01:20:29,467
I come in peace.

704
01:20:30,147 --> 01:20:32,969
And I love America too.

705
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:35,671
All right.

706
01:20:36,931 --> 01:20:37,452
All right.

707
01:20:37,572 --> 01:20:38,012
All right.

708
01:20:38,933 --> 01:20:40,754
Greg Toro on the big sexy bass.

709
01:20:41,954 --> 01:20:43,675
Gordon Angle Gow on the drums.

710
01:20:44,956 --> 01:20:46,677
Jonathan Fagan on the keys.

711
01:20:47,418 --> 01:20:47,898
All right.

712
01:20:48,058 --> 01:20:48,398
All right.

713
01:20:53,532 --> 01:20:54,873
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

714
01:20:55,313 --> 01:20:57,674
All right, so here's the corollary.

715
01:20:57,694 --> 01:21:01,755
All right, because there's always got to be some connective tissue to this stuff.

716
01:21:02,576 --> 01:21:05,977
All right, so we're going to do a piece called Alienation.

717
01:21:06,457 --> 01:21:09,399
And it's really, really on my mind right now.

718
01:21:09,499 --> 01:21:12,340
So maybe on a lot of y'all's as well.

719
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:13,900
So here we go.

720
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:21,684
Is this great?

721
01:21:21,764 --> 01:21:22,184
What does this mean?

722
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:24,741
Okay, all right.

723
01:21:26,264 --> 01:21:27,726
Here is a fence without a gate.

724
01:21:28,186 --> 01:21:29,749
You can't get in, you have to wait.

725
01:21:30,249 --> 01:21:32,693
You can't be foreign or somehow strange.

726
01:21:33,334 --> 01:21:35,317
This isn't your home, home on the range.

727
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,185
You can't arrive in a rickety boat.

728
01:21:38,705 --> 01:21:40,746
Our castle has a treacherous moat.

729
01:21:41,127 --> 01:21:43,908
We won't host refugees at our door.

730
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:46,009
You're not the sort we're looking for.

731
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:47,790
Take good note.

732
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:48,871
We stay on guard.

733
01:21:48,931 --> 01:21:50,792
We don't want you in our backyard.

734
01:21:51,152 --> 01:21:56,555
Despite the dangers you seek to avoid, our best deterrents have been deployed.

735
01:21:58,391 --> 01:22:00,212
You say your country's full of peril.

736
01:22:00,872 --> 01:22:03,392
But like stray cats, we think you're feral.

737
01:22:03,993 --> 01:22:06,593
We think you're prone to filth and crime.

738
01:22:06,873 --> 01:22:08,914
We don't want either at this time.

739
01:22:10,774 --> 01:22:12,415
We don't care what the nations say.

740
01:22:12,755 --> 01:22:14,956
They won't do more than hope and pray.

741
01:22:15,416 --> 01:22:17,416
Our stance is clear on human rights.

742
01:22:17,956 --> 01:22:18,657
Lock the door.

743
01:22:19,097 --> 01:22:19,937
Turn off the lights.

744
01:22:21,877 --> 01:22:23,558
You saw that statue in the bay.

745
01:22:24,699 --> 01:22:26,421
It stood for liberty until today.

746
01:22:27,041 --> 01:22:31,686
It welcomed tired and huddled masses, not criminals from your underclasses.

747
01:22:33,127 --> 01:22:34,909
We've got militias on the border.

748
01:22:35,209 --> 01:22:37,512
They own big guns to keep the order.

749
01:22:38,032 --> 01:22:42,797
Law enforcement lets them stay to help them keep your kind at bay.

750
01:22:44,443 --> 01:22:45,886
Why do we feel that this is good?

751
01:22:46,307 --> 01:22:47,911
Why can't we share the neighborhood?

752
01:22:48,512 --> 01:22:50,877
Is it because you're black and brown?

753
01:22:51,378 --> 01:22:54,926
No, we just choose to stand our ground.

754
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:06,151
stay in your place, deal with your issues.

755
01:23:06,591 --> 01:23:08,992
We'll send lots of coal and tissues.

756
01:23:09,772 --> 01:23:11,913
Don't form caravans and run.

757
01:23:12,213 --> 01:23:14,154
You'll find yourself in the sight of a gun.

758
01:23:16,855 --> 01:23:19,696
There are no streets here lined with gold.

759
01:23:20,236 --> 01:23:22,597
Our eyes are closed, our hearts are cold.

760
01:23:22,657 --> 01:23:25,118
There is no flowing milk and honey.

761
01:23:25,518 --> 01:23:28,019
American skies are not that sunny.

762
01:23:31,065 --> 01:23:33,446
The fences we build keep aliens out.

763
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:36,147
They serve to keep our faith devout.

764
01:23:36,507 --> 01:23:41,668
This land we scheme to make our own, it's ours, you see, and ours alone.

765
01:23:44,409 --> 01:23:48,990
As long as you stay on the other side, we can maintain our national pride.

766
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:52,091
Please don't show us your anguished faces.

767
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:54,392
We're cutting back on other races.

768
01:23:56,182 --> 01:23:58,143
We've had enough of this global inclusion.

769
01:23:58,503 --> 01:24:00,644
We're ridding this country of race confusion.

770
01:24:01,165 --> 01:24:06,668
We know how to win these fights and limit all these civil rights.

771
01:24:09,469 --> 01:24:13,791
Safety nets in the welfare state will have to stop for the lost and late.

772
01:24:14,792 --> 01:24:17,433
A rising tide that favors the rich.

773
01:24:18,234 --> 01:24:20,375
That's our favorite campaign pitch.

774
01:24:21,902 --> 01:24:24,163
Me Too movements and Black Lives Matter?

775
01:24:24,703 --> 01:24:26,944
In all due time, your ranks will scatter.

776
01:24:27,224 --> 01:24:29,665
You think that you shall overcome?

777
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:31,185
Just cross this line.

778
01:24:31,905 --> 01:24:32,806
We'll give you some.

779
01:24:35,246 --> 01:24:39,968
We'll give you a taste of burning churches and black boys hung from oaks and birches.

780
01:24:40,568 --> 01:24:45,770
We'll give you a taste of incarceration in prisons.com, the corporate plantation.

781
01:24:48,187 --> 01:24:57,355
We're taking this country back to a time when a brown life wasn't worth a dime, except for the way it worked in the field, except for a bushel of crops to yield.

782
01:24:57,795 --> 01:25:07,243
We're taking this country back to the day when white meant right in every way, when men of privilege could rape and beat and kill for spite, then lie and cheat.

783
01:25:09,126 --> 01:25:22,033
We're taking this homeland back to the season when hooded marauders needed no reason to hunt folks down with rifles and dogs through the lonely woods, the swamps, and bogs.

784
01:25:24,014 --> 01:25:34,560
When Confederate flags were boldly raised and crosses in the darkness blazed and the land was full of racial hate served with grits on a breakfast plate.

785
01:25:42,491 --> 01:25:47,973
You thought this worm had surely turned and young black bodies no longer burned.

786
01:25:48,553 --> 01:25:53,714
Yet here you are again today with the specter of prejudice winning the day.

787
01:25:55,455 --> 01:25:59,616
The MAGA caps we wear with pride, they let us know who's on our side.

788
01:26:00,196 --> 01:26:05,918
That pointed hood and long white robe, fine clothes for the xenophobe.

789
01:26:08,367 --> 01:26:14,469
Perhaps this place that immigrants covet can somehow heal and rise above it.

790
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:20,292
Until that day, our best advice to call this home, you'll pay a price.

791
01:26:22,112 --> 01:26:27,314
You'll pay a price as many misguided embrace the hate their voice provided.

792
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:33,637
His Twitter rants and sound bites full of ethnocentric cock and bull.

793
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:40,419
You'll pay a price as higher walls lead great climbers to greater falls.

794
01:26:46,226 --> 01:26:52,213
Where fences are the new condition announcing the refugees abolition.

795
01:26:54,767 --> 01:26:59,629
This isn't our nation's greatest hour, this flexing of white supremacist power.

796
01:27:00,229 --> 01:27:06,352
And yet, the season is fully revealing the stain of hatred we've been concealing.

797
01:27:11,775 --> 01:27:15,836
So take good note and be on guard of deadly traps around the yard.

798
01:27:16,437 --> 01:27:21,359
Our agents are on high alert to keep you foreigners off this dirt.

799
01:27:26,667 --> 01:27:28,608
Tolerance is in short supply.

800
01:27:29,168 --> 01:27:34,431
We won't let your kind occupy this sacred land our forebears built.

801
01:27:35,191 --> 01:27:37,872
We don't subscribe to Anglo guilt.

802
01:27:40,773 --> 01:27:45,776
This fence was built without a gate to keep out all who come here late.

803
01:27:46,556 --> 01:27:50,318
To all you aliens, we don't like strange.

804
01:27:51,158 --> 01:27:55,300
No room at the inn in our home on the range.

805
01:28:07,347 --> 01:28:08,328
Yeah, okay.

806
01:28:08,688 --> 01:28:16,334
All right, so you've had a lot of the social justice, but not as much as the outright jazz.

807
01:28:16,354 --> 01:28:18,575
So we're going to do the outright jazz right now.

808
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:20,197
This is called

809
01:28:22,236 --> 01:28:35,588
Okay, so backstory on this is Herbie Hancock wrote a beautiful composition many years ago called Tell Me a Bedtime Story, and Quincy Jones re-recorded it beautifully.

810
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:42,415
So this is a reimagining of Tell Me a Bedtime Story, and it's called Tell Me Another Bedtime Story.

811
01:29:09,782 --> 01:29:16,326
Is this where the Sandman picks up each grain, restoring the beauty, reducing the pain?

812
01:29:17,607 --> 01:29:23,490
Is this where we fly to never, never land like a troop of lost boys with Peter Pan?

813
01:29:27,232 --> 01:29:31,495
All of the mystery of hidden dreams, nothing now is as it seems.

814
01:29:32,175 --> 01:29:38,438
Tell a sweet tale that sugars and creams with flashes of stardust and shining moonbeams.

815
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:46,174
As I lay down to my slumber, paint a landscape of ochre and umber.

816
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:49,576
Let there be a hint of romance.

817
01:29:50,276 --> 01:29:51,317
Turn up the quiet.

818
01:29:51,877 --> 01:29:53,157
Love wants to dance.

819
01:29:59,588 --> 01:30:17,436
tell me a bedtime story please of secret gardens and pecan trees of babbling brooks and waterfalls of gentle breezes that summer calls of hidden havens and wondrous spaces of astral planes and mystical places

820
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:29,722
Let there be a melody that sings in four-part harmony.

821
01:30:30,382 --> 01:30:35,803
Let it resound in symphony, then fold into dreamland's reverie.

822
01:30:38,144 --> 01:30:50,868
Tell me a fable of Arabian nights spread on a table of earthly delights, free from the label of anger and fights, willing and able to scale higher heights.

823
01:30:58,495 --> 01:31:22,656
Tell me a bedtime story now, as the baby rocks in the maple bough, as the blue ox puts his nose to the plow, and the sweaty farmer wipes his brow, as each green seedling happily vows to yield each fruit the ground allows, and seven dwarves whistle a happy tune, and sleeping beauty awakens soon.

824
01:31:27,793 --> 01:31:33,315
Let there be a melody that sings in four-part harmony.

825
01:31:34,796 --> 01:31:40,639
Let it resound in symphony, then fold into dreamland's reverie.

826
01:31:59,850 --> 01:32:13,045
This is a time when the sandman whispers, and seven grooms meet seven sisters, and the prairie sings an ode to love as angels release the turtle dove.

827
01:32:47,822 --> 01:32:56,232
For now, I lay me down to sleep and pray to God my soul to keep.

828
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:04,902
Gordon Angle got on the drums.

829
01:33:07,183 --> 01:33:08,203
Yeah, buddy.

830
01:33:11,344 --> 01:33:13,064
Real nice, real nice, real nice.

831
01:33:13,164 --> 01:33:17,785
Okay, so let's do another jazz piece.

832
01:33:17,885 --> 01:33:18,966
Is this just me and you?

833
01:33:19,206 --> 01:33:34,050
Okay, so if you know the jazz canon at all, you know like the big names and you know, Miles Davis and you know, John Coltrane and you know,

834
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:39,817
Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, you know, you just, you know the big names.

835
01:33:39,877 --> 01:33:43,679
Sometimes the folks that could go by a first name only.

836
01:33:44,539 --> 01:33:46,100
This was one of those people.

837
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:49,861
And you could use either his first name or his last name.

838
01:33:50,221 --> 01:33:54,402
You could call him Monk or you could call him Thelonious.

839
01:33:55,103 --> 01:33:57,023
And everybody knew who you were talking about.

840
01:33:59,064 --> 01:34:00,004
I call him Thelonious.

841
01:34:00,924 --> 01:34:01,545
All right, anyways.

842
01:34:05,322 --> 01:34:07,664
This piece is called Thelonious Assault.

843
01:34:09,406 --> 01:34:10,487
Kind of play on words.

844
01:34:10,507 --> 01:34:11,327
Okay.

845
01:34:16,352 --> 01:34:22,598
You were the mystic and the mage with every scribble on each lined page.

846
01:34:23,478 --> 01:34:29,344
So deadly serious at that bench with eyes ablaze and teeth in clench.

847
01:34:31,262 --> 01:34:36,446
Tones that spin, discordant perfection, harmonic twists in every direction.

848
01:34:36,466 --> 01:34:42,752
What is the meaning of all this scatter as you summon rhythmic anti-matter?

849
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:53,681
Why must you rage and violently pound each key to achieve such a potent sound, reveling in a cerulean funk?

850
01:34:54,181 --> 01:34:56,303
You were the least obedient monk.

851
01:34:58,081 --> 01:35:00,886
Sometimes you'd wax melodic and quiet.

852
01:35:01,728 --> 01:35:04,112
Then you'd revert to the din of a riot.

853
01:35:05,615 --> 01:35:10,043
Every chord with a stranglehold on conventional music's centerfold.

854
01:35:12,045 --> 01:35:18,087
A bit of the Duke's panache in style with James P. Johnson's strident guile.

855
01:35:18,928 --> 01:35:24,710
Yours was the most ambitious spirit in every bar the night can hear it.

856
01:35:26,690 --> 01:35:28,691
The grand piano majestically sits.

857
01:35:29,111 --> 01:35:31,172
It has no sense of the crimes it commits.

858
01:35:31,592 --> 01:35:36,854
It tolerates explosive bits of cosmic slop as the maestro sits.

859
01:35:39,768 --> 01:35:43,109
In a soft felt fez or a pork pie hat?

860
01:35:43,989 --> 01:35:45,790
You are a different kind of cat.

861
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:50,771
Fingers like Harlem stickball bats, scurrying quick like tenement rats.

862
01:35:51,151 --> 01:35:53,492
Over those keys while the saxophone scats.

863
01:35:53,872 --> 01:35:55,792
Over those keys while the drummer pats.

864
01:35:56,213 --> 01:36:01,134
Over those keys with sharps and flats while the bass man thumbs out welcome mats.

865
01:36:01,174 --> 01:36:03,975
In front of the door of Handy and Fats.

866
01:36:04,435 --> 01:36:07,296
Real conversation, not idle chats.

867
01:36:10,114 --> 01:36:15,521
Wed to the notes like a pretty young wife, you brought jazz piano back to life.

868
01:36:16,422 --> 01:36:22,469
And made the music cut like a knife, skipping chords and dissonant strife.

869
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:28,817
Never to march like a drum and fife, with crackling sparks your soul was rife.

870
01:36:33,363 --> 01:36:36,207
Yet waves of sickness embraced your spirit.

871
01:36:37,008 --> 01:36:39,712
The music allowed you to hardly hear it.

872
01:36:40,493 --> 01:36:43,277
Oceans of darkness and you didn't fear it.

873
01:36:44,018 --> 01:36:47,022
A constant hurdle, we watched you clear it.

874
01:36:49,220 --> 01:37:09,613
Oh, rather we listened in special awe As camels buckled with every straw You piled on top of harmonic law As bop and stride made doubters thaw You'd ever succumb to a tragic flaw And be undone by depression's claw

875
01:37:13,005 --> 01:37:19,228
So still, the vinyl adorns the platter as we revel in musical anti-matter.

876
01:37:20,388 --> 01:37:26,871
Madame Panonica's lilting splatter round midnight with a truly mad hatter.

877
01:37:29,702 --> 01:37:38,445
Solitude embraces a tortured soul that scales the peaks of an opposite pole through a Thorazine haze that takes its toll.

878
01:37:39,165 --> 01:37:42,727
And still the maestro maintains control.

879
01:37:45,068 --> 01:37:49,929
The Steinway bursts in dynamic tone, and yet the madness won't leave him alone.

880
01:37:50,670 --> 01:37:57,252
The abbot cowers and runs to pray as the musical friar prepares to slay.

881
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:13,850
The Steinway engages in mystical work while legions of demons quietly lurk, ready to take the altar away to assault the monk as we hear him play.

882
01:38:19,574 --> 01:38:24,738
Jonathan Fagan on the keys, channeling his inner Thelonious.

883
01:38:25,819 --> 01:38:26,279
Very good.

884
01:38:38,595 --> 01:38:42,218
Okay, let's do Legacy and if Bobby had a choice.

885
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:44,220
Okay, all right.

886
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:51,486
So, we're gonna do a piece called Legacy that we really, really love.

887
01:38:54,269 --> 01:38:55,229
I hope I can find it.

888
01:38:56,170 --> 01:38:56,831
Okay, here we go.

889
01:39:00,154 --> 01:39:00,454
All right.

890
01:39:02,872 --> 01:39:04,955
This is for the storytellers in all of us.

891
01:39:07,638 --> 01:39:09,019
Okay, here we go.

892
01:39:33,965 --> 01:39:36,307
It's not for you to tell your own story.

893
01:39:37,468 --> 01:39:39,249
That is the burden of your children.

894
01:39:40,230 --> 01:39:43,893
They must shoulder this yoke with love and loyalty.

895
01:39:45,234 --> 01:39:52,660
And yet, you have not gathered them and bid them sit before the campfires of their elders.

896
01:39:53,801 --> 01:39:59,826
You have not seasoned their meals with the spice of their identity and the savor of their names.

897
01:40:01,027 --> 01:40:04,888
How will they learn to walk the walk and talk the talk?

898
01:40:05,408 --> 01:40:14,469
How will they learn to tell your stories even as they live out their own?

899
01:40:19,990 --> 01:40:28,332
Sons and daughters and heirs, if you didn't smell the burning ash or feel the warmth of the flame on your neck, you don't know.

900
01:40:30,564 --> 01:40:39,490
If you didn't revel in the growl of the griot's earthy reply or the trill of the mockingbird's cry, you don't know.

901
01:40:40,831 --> 01:40:49,798
If mama was too tired and daddy too long gone to carry the wood, light the spark, and stoke the flames, you don't know.

902
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:58,244
And until the lion cub knows how to tell the pride stories, the hunters will always tell them first.

903
01:41:06,073 --> 01:41:08,896
The good book says, train up the child in the way they should go.

904
01:41:09,916 --> 01:41:21,187
Will we let them depart from the community of faith and the city on a hill without the master's touch, without the oil of his anointing and his full measure of grace?

905
01:41:23,363 --> 01:41:37,765
Will we not show them Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fufina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda, and Songololo's new tackies?

906
01:41:51,588 --> 01:41:56,311
The prophet says he will encourage fathers and their children to return.

907
01:41:56,811 --> 01:42:07,918
But how will they know the way home if no map charts the seas, measures the roads, sites, the peaks and valleys, and names each forest despite the thickening trees?

908
01:42:09,639 --> 01:42:13,241
Will the burden of the elder stories be too heavy for the children?

909
01:42:14,442 --> 01:42:15,723
Will they care to carry?

910
01:42:16,847 --> 01:42:18,148
Will they dare to tarry?

911
01:42:18,188 --> 01:42:20,810
Will they linger at the foot of the griot?

912
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:24,813
Will they hunger for the wisdom of the sage?

913
01:42:29,737 --> 01:42:40,385
We must put them on the page, where hard work earns the man his wage, where power is measured by God's own gauge, where miracles scoff at the wand of a mage.

914
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:57,467
We must share with them the truth that is loyal and fierce, like Naomi and Ruth, that doesn't wait for the confessional booth, that has the bite of the panther's tooth.

915
01:43:00,288 --> 01:43:09,873
This is a gift of legacy, where a glorious past sets the captives free, and a candle's light beckons liberty.

916
01:43:15,338 --> 01:43:29,386
Sons and daughters and heirs, I bid you sit before the campfires of your elders, hear their stories, gather up their stones, and build up your strength.

917
01:43:31,027 --> 01:43:44,275
They will show you Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fafina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda and Songololo's new tackies.

918
01:43:46,911 --> 01:43:49,296
Soon, you will be the herald.

919
01:43:50,218 --> 01:43:53,585
Write these things down on the tablets of your spirit.

920
01:43:54,207 --> 01:43:56,471
Let them put a running in your feet.

921
01:44:06,338 --> 01:44:13,005
With each quickening step, you repel the arrows of the hunter with the shield of abiding faith.

922
01:44:13,886 --> 01:44:18,351
You capture the flags of your enemies and gather up their spoils.

923
01:44:19,312 --> 01:44:25,800
You remain the lions of the pride and your tails will always be your children's brand.

924
01:44:37,968 --> 01:44:57,842
You will never abandon the community of faith, though you build a thousand cities on a hill, drawing wonderous strength from the master's touch as the oil of his anointing fills your clay jars with his grace.

925
01:44:58,943 --> 01:45:03,186
OK.

926
01:45:04,187 --> 01:45:04,507
Cool.

927
01:45:05,968 --> 01:45:06,308
All right.

928
01:45:08,914 --> 01:45:19,462
A long while ago, I wrote this piece, and Ruth Youngblood, God Rest Her Gentle Soul, it was her favorite, favorite poem.

929
01:45:19,502 --> 01:45:25,326
And whenever she would hear me, you know, or be somewhere where I was going to read poetry, she would always say,

930
01:45:25,766 --> 01:45:27,127
Are you gonna do the Barbie poem?

931
01:45:27,167 --> 01:45:28,468
Are you gonna do the Barbie poem?

932
01:45:28,949 --> 01:45:30,990
And the poem was called Barbie Doesn't Live Here.

933
01:45:32,571 --> 01:45:47,043
I hope that Ruth is in eternity smiling down on us right now, because I wrote a corollary to that poem that I think that she would like as well, and it's called If Barbie Had a Choice.

934
01:46:03,218 --> 01:46:09,825
If Barbie had a choice, I believe that from day one, she would have made it a black thing.

935
01:46:11,227 --> 01:46:16,232
She would have ditched the creamsicle skin and gone with the lustrous ebony you.

936
01:46:17,774 --> 01:46:24,702
She would have spoken with an evil dialect with a true queen's attitude and said, to hell with you colonizers.

937
01:46:25,878 --> 01:46:32,006
package me up in a pink box with white lettering and a bunch of beachy palms and sand in the background?

938
01:46:32,727 --> 01:46:34,289
I think not.

939
01:46:35,991 --> 01:46:43,821
You can't get these ample breasts and these curvaceous hips into that Goldie Hawn psychedelic mini.

940
01:46:45,037 --> 01:46:47,279
I'ma need a little something more substantial.

941
01:46:48,040 --> 01:46:55,727
I'ma need copious yards of single-leaf cotton with shiny batik totems and all the colors of the motherland.

942
01:46:57,088 --> 01:47:04,815
I'ma need a Wakanda seamstress straight out of the Ruth Powder School to hook the thing right and show the world what I'm working with.

943
01:47:05,636 --> 01:47:09,240
I'ma need Maiden Dahomey, not by Mattel and Disney.

944
01:47:13,317 --> 01:47:22,678
If Barbie had a choice, Ken would have looked more like Ali or Denzel or that fine ass dark chocolate British cat Idris Elba.

945
01:47:23,843 --> 01:47:27,206
He would have been melanated, not barely suntanned.

946
01:47:27,867 --> 01:47:34,794
And by no means would he have seen more holiday tissue wrap than 150 grit sandpaper.

947
01:47:35,494 --> 01:47:44,003
He would have been swashbuckling like Marvel's T'Challa, woke like Tupac, and standing on business like Brother Malcolm.

948
01:47:54,214 --> 01:48:04,749
She would have kissed that man with unretouched, un-botoxed, black girl lips, lush and full as a tropical rainforest.

949
01:48:08,564 --> 01:48:14,828
She would have engulfed her man in every quaking inch of the last poet's black thighs.

950
01:48:15,509 --> 01:48:17,430
If you don't know, YouTube it.

951
01:48:18,251 --> 01:48:25,936
She would have no need for a Brazilian butt lift or a Beverly Hills boob job or an Adobe Photoshop session.

952
01:48:25,996 --> 01:48:30,519
Mother Africa and a generous genome took care of all of that.

953
01:48:30,839 --> 01:48:31,440
You feel me?

954
01:48:39,382 --> 01:48:44,646
If Barbie had a choice, you would never have been able to buy her at Toys R Us, F.A.O.

955
01:48:44,666 --> 01:48:46,487
Schwartz, or Mary Arnold's.

956
01:48:47,048 --> 01:48:51,871
She wouldn't have been a fake trophy bride, a chick on the side, or a Bonnie for Clyde.

957
01:48:52,231 --> 01:48:57,455
She wouldn't have been an American Girl Addie, a hot Lana Batty, or Dance Moms Maddie.

958
01:48:57,775 --> 01:49:03,740
She wouldn't have been It Girl Margot Robbie, or Cherry Pie's Barbie, or P. Diddy Harvey.

959
01:49:06,508 --> 01:49:12,972
I'ma close the flow with a few more rhymes, just a few bronze bars to end this on time.

960
01:49:15,854 --> 01:49:18,635
A new newbie and Bobby wouldn't stand for nonsense.

961
01:49:19,136 --> 01:49:21,317
A brother's pursuit couldn't sit on the fence.

962
01:49:21,717 --> 01:49:24,399
Her womanly wiles would be truly immense.

963
01:49:24,919 --> 01:49:27,601
A player would just find her game too intense.

964
01:49:28,041 --> 01:49:31,223
With never a true shot at love's recompense.

965
01:49:32,695 --> 01:49:40,600
Though he might pull up in a Bentley or Rolls, he'd lose by a landslide at a real queen's pose.

966
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,122
A new newbie in Bobby would demand mad respect.

967
01:49:45,623 --> 01:49:47,704
She wouldn't suffer abuse or neglect.

968
01:49:48,224 --> 01:49:51,106
She'd fight for her own like a goji elite.

969
01:49:51,726 --> 01:49:54,748
She wouldn't be tame, demure, or petite.

970
01:50:00,927 --> 01:50:04,948
No, things would be different on this I make bet.

971
01:50:05,428 --> 01:50:07,789
A pimp or a hustler would not be a threat.

972
01:50:08,289 --> 01:50:15,210
As fine as the print on the national debt, her beauty and wisdom would not break a sweat.

973
01:50:19,351 --> 01:50:25,333
That glitzy white Barbie might have a toy jet, but she hasn't landed a soul plane yet.

974
01:50:26,373 --> 01:50:29,634
My African queen makes the real kings forget.

975
01:50:33,445 --> 01:50:37,690
though she might wanna keep that fly pink Corvette.

976
01:50:41,234 --> 01:50:42,315
All right, all right.

977
01:50:43,857 --> 01:50:46,000
Greg Toro on the bass.

978
01:50:47,113 --> 01:50:48,635
Gordon Angle, guy on the drums.

979
01:50:49,376 --> 01:50:51,578
My man, Jonathan Fagan on the piano.

980
01:50:52,099 --> 01:50:53,260
I'm Terry E. Carter.

981
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:56,464
You've been a very gracious and lovely audience.

982
01:50:57,585 --> 01:51:02,110
That's pretty much it for the music portion of this evening.

983
01:51:02,590 --> 01:51:07,136
I just want to make a few announcements, a few pauses for the cause.

984
01:51:07,156 --> 01:51:08,317
So give me just a second.

985
01:51:27,571 --> 01:51:33,598
All right, so again, thanks to everyone who's joined us for the more recent Fresh Fridays program.

986
01:51:33,658 --> 01:51:42,228
We've had a lot, we have lots more great conversations to explore and more great music to discover and connect you with.

987
01:51:43,389 --> 01:51:48,533
Elders, join us each week, Tuesday through Thursday, for a nutritious lunch and a vibrant fellowship.

988
01:51:48,894 --> 01:51:50,355
Lunch is served at 12 noon.

989
01:51:50,415 --> 01:51:55,139
Call 781-483-3042 to make a reservation.

990
01:51:55,880 --> 01:52:03,467
Please join us in WMCC membership and make sure that we have your contact information for future outreach and noise.

991
01:52:04,087 --> 01:52:11,033
Check our indoor and outdoor bulletin boards regularly for all kinds of valuable information and community updates.

992
01:52:12,054 --> 01:52:20,781
WMCC is planning a few special events for the celebration of our 90th anniversary as a legacy neighborhood organization in Medford.

993
01:52:21,282 --> 01:52:27,547
Stay tuned for more news about these events that will take place over Memorial Day weekend.

994
01:52:29,329 --> 01:52:30,530
How you can help us?

995
01:52:32,091 --> 01:52:37,656
Your tax-deductible donations help to support the mission of WMCC.

996
01:52:39,257 --> 01:52:43,441
We're dealing with the probability of less money from

997
01:52:45,182 --> 01:52:56,710
CDBG grant because of them potentially getting less or potentially no money from the federal government who we are in deep doo-doo with apparently because we live here in Massachusetts.

998
01:52:57,090 --> 01:52:58,671
But that's another story for another day.

999
01:52:59,271 --> 01:53:01,913
Partner with us in carrying the mission forward.

1000
01:53:02,774 --> 01:53:07,717
Please consider making a tax deductible donation to this vital community organization.

1001
01:53:07,757 --> 01:53:08,758
You make your donation,

1002
01:53:09,618 --> 01:53:20,408
by phone, online, or by check, please contact Lisa Crossman at 781-483-3042 for more information or to become a member.

1003
01:53:21,029 --> 01:53:22,911
Okay, so Wednesday, May 7th, 2025,

1004
01:53:25,433 --> 01:53:38,022
from 6 to 8 p.m., commemorate the significant roles that black people played in the battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19th, 1775.

1005
01:53:39,283 --> 01:53:47,609
Military Patriot Silas Burdue had a key role in that battle.

1006
01:53:48,549 --> 01:53:58,676
He was an active combatant, and there's been a documentary made about that called the Black Patriots of Lexington.

1007
01:53:59,516 --> 01:54:02,058
And there's some screenings that will be taking place.

1008
01:54:03,738 --> 01:54:23,232

1010
01:54:38,463 --> 01:54:44,147
So, you know, she's available and she definitely wants to talk with folks here in West Medford.

I'm Terry E. Carter.

1020
01:56:29,379 --> 01:56:31,781
I'm happy to have shared this time with you tonight.

1021
01:56:32,301 --> 01:56:33,842
That's the Ally Project.

1022
01:56:34,362 --> 01:56:38,405
And we've loved presenting for you here this evening.

1023

And we'll hopefully see you back here again soon.

1026

Thank you.

1027
01:56:54,055 --> 01:56:55,740
Oh yeah, if you're interested.
