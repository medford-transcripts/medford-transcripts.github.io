    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3.053s">No,</a>  it's not resilience, is it?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4.473s">A</a>  climate engagement associate.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=5.954s">Client</a>  engagement associate, yes, beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=8.956s">Shannon</a>  engages community members and organizations in the upstream misted communities to ensure climate resilient solutions reflect their interests and needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=20.584s">She</a>  works on building relationships around the impacts of stormwater flooding and other issues residents are facing due to climate change. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=29.17s">Before</a>  joining MIRA, she completed a service term in public health through AmeriCorps, hosted by Everett Community Growers. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=37.837s">During</a>  that time, she grew a passion for community engagement and food justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=43.721s">Shannon</a>  graduated from the University of Connecticut, go Huskies, with a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies and Human Rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=51.907s">In</a>  her free time, this is interesting, she enjoys going for walks, crocheting, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=58.572s">Cutting</a>  hair. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=59.233s">I</a>  was trying to figure that one out. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=61.154s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=61.754s">And</a>  trying new foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=63.636s">Please</a>  allow me to introduce a new friend to the program, Myra Shannon Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=71.481s">All</a>  righty. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=72.162s">All</a>  righty. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=73.321s">So</a>  as is my custom in hosting these evenings, those of you that have been to a number of them certainly know this, and particularly as we observe National Poetry Month, I'd like to share a bit of verse to help shape the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=91.829s">I'm</a>  in my justice phase for a whole lot of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=97.572s">Okay,</a>  um, and since we're going to talk about being abutters to a great New England river, and since my mind is always on equity, um, and, um, and social justice, let's have a listen to Mystic River Melancholy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=115.561s">The</a>  freshly quaffed boho boys make real estate videos extolling the finer virtues of West Medford and life along the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=125.485s">Maybe</a>  they're new money kids or tough grads that don't know the rich history of the village. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=131.269s">They</a>  do have a sense that this is a minor mecca for ex-city dwellers, flush with IPO cash, NFT windfalls, or Bitcoin early adoptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=142.017s">A</a>  new gentry that wants to be landed for their dogs and their Range Rovers and their wine tastings and the next generation of trust fund babies. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=151.604s">The</a>  would-be property princes have a target market. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=155.527s">The</a>  YouTube appeal is slick and shiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=158.189s">Classic</a>  Americana with a side of sushi or a venti mocha latte. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=163.117s">They</a>  have no idea of what used to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=165.978s">They</a>  know what the next wave wants to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=168.878s">They</a>  want to see the bikes, the hikes, and the kids on trikes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=171.999s">They</a>  want to post pics that will get lots of likes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=175.359s">They</a>  want to see the flowering trees and the birds and the bees. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=178.52s">Their</a>  high rise havens had none of these. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=181.881s">They</a>  want to see if they can grow something green in a backyard garden beyond the green that's growing in their bulging bank accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=190.353s">Designer</a>  overalls and Doc Martens do not a farmer make. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=194.756s">No</a>  worries, Whole Foods has gone 100% organic with a great selection of finely curated herbs and spices. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=203.258s">I</a>  know that this sounds like resentment. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=205.88s">Resignation</a>  frequently does. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=208.461s">But</a>  when the private boat clubs bookend the public beach and the abutters don't want loud, unruly Dominicans descending on their hillsides for beachfront parking, well, what's a brother from the Ville to think? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=221.288s">My</a>  daddy taught me how to fish here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=224.51s">Not</a>  much more than eels and sunfish in the water then, but we felt like it was legacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=231.054s">And</a>  we were happy to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=234.093s">They</a>  really didn't want us at their beach back then either. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=238.076s">But</a>  we were mighty in our minority. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=240.799s">We</a>  didn't want to fight, folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=242.94s">But</a>  the lake wasn't exactly pristine, so why begrudge it to anybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=248.685s">We</a>  could walk the half mile or ride our stingray bikes down the infield connected to the small waves and the gentle wake. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=255.731s">We</a>  could wonder about the kayakers and the canoe paddlers. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=262.872s">the</a>  colorful sunfishes, occasional scholars, and the ubiquitous motor boaters. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=267.973s">We</a>  could dream a little dream about owning a dinghy and a trawling engine and making a few waves of our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=276.535s">Don't</a>  get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=278.075s">I</a>  love the new fish ladders and the intrepid herring counters, the trout infusion, and the bald eagle sightings, and the focus on environmental sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=289.71s">Thing</a>  is, they love it too, and they can afford to pay for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=296.094s">1.4</a>  mil for Queen Dorothy Elizabeth Tucker's old homestead. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=300.356s">It</a>  should have been a historical landmark. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=303.058s">Instead,</a>  it's yet another preview of coming attractions. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=307.64s">Meanwhile,</a>  the sleepy little Nubian Hamlet has released its black and brown patina to the inexorable tug of real property values and the dying off of the old guard. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=319.578s">Mine</a>  is the last generation that knew about the first three streets, Arlington, Lincoln, and Jerome. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=327.466s">That</a>  knew about the little store, the old Shiloh Baptist, and the library in the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=335.554s">Mine</a>  is the last generation that knew about Charlie Booker and the Bruins, the five fighting Phillips brothers, Uncle Buddy's postal command, Doc Count's blue books, Faucina and Evelyn's beauty salon, and exactly why it's called Duggar Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=352.929s">So</a>  many firsts, so much history, so little time to savor and to save, to preserve and to pass on. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=361.574s">So</a>  many departures and so few arrivals of the black and the brown and the tan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=369.089s">Meanwhile,</a>  the developers mostly have their way. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=372.012s">The</a>  Spanish day laborers tear it down, build it back up. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=375.815s">Like</a>  Lee Majors and the six million dollar man, they have the technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=380.579s">They</a>  can make them better than they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=382.681s">Better,</a>  stronger, faster. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=385.718s">Condos</a>  and townhouses, Tony and Trendy out with the old, in with the new. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=391.021s">Wash,</a>  rinse, and repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=394.143s">Meanwhile,</a>  the freshly quaffed boho boys make real estate videos, extolling the finer virtues of West Medford and life along the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=407.692s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=408.252s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=411.074s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=411.974s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=413.375s">So</a>  now let's have a look at Myra and see what's new and exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=418.679s">It's</a>  time for a friendly chat with our friend Shannon Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=423.923s">So</a>  Shannon, will you talk a little bit about your educational background and what attracted you to environmental studies and human rights as a major?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=434.176s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=435.378s">So</a>  I studied environmental studies at UConn and I started doing environmental science because I really just like being outside and then took my first lab class and realized I couldn't do the math and like microscope kind of science. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=450.978s">But</a>  I really loved the environment still, and I knew I loved people, so I was like, how do I find a job where I can work with people all day, but it's for the betterment of the environment and addressing climate change, which I think is probably the issue of my generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=465.87s">I</a>  immediately after school worked in Everett at the Everett Community Growers Community Farm organization and it was like a perfect combination of working with people and a local community and getting some really important things done but like for the earth and for the community and that's my favorite thing so at Mystic River Watershed I got to do a really similar work so I love it.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=487.884s">Fantastic.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=488.505s">Now</a>  were you from here originally?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=491.058s">So</a>  I grew up in Melrose, my dad grew up in Arlington, and my parents' first apartment together was actually on High Street.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=498.362s">Okay,</a>  so you're somewhat local. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=500.322s">Pretty</a>  local. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=500.763s">Okay,</a>  very good, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=503.884s">For</a>  the folks that may not be familiar with MIRA, can you talk about the mission and the work of the organization?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=510.02s">Yes,</a>  so the watershed, for those that don't know, is a big regional way of thinking about the connections from the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=518.282s">So</a>  it's 21 communities from Boston up to Burlington and Reading, all in between, and it all drains into the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=526.143s">So</a>  that's the area we work in. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=528.464s">And</a>  because water doesn't care about town lines, we work throughout all those towns and communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=534.885s">Myra</a>  works with keeping the river healthy, the communities healthy, and started as just a water quality organization and then has grown way more into looking at parks and paths like we're talking about today, looking at climate, looking at river herring. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=551.806s">So</a>  yeah, we do a lot of cool things.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=553.766s">Okay,</a>  very good, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=557.708s">So</a>  my own experience with Myra has shown me that you're very much a volunteer-driven organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=566.831s">What</a>  sort of ways can community members be involved with the watershed?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=572.292s">Yeah,</a>  so it's Poetry Month and it's also Earth Month, which is a really cool combination. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=577.775s">So</a>  as it's getting warmer, there's so many ways to get out into the watershed and do some volunteering with us and other awesome groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=584.579s">So</a>  we do have a ton of events. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=586.18s">I</a>  wrote some down because it's a really exciting time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=590.122s">We</a>  have a lot of tree plantings coming up, which are going to be really fun for Earth Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=595.045s">We</a>  do trash pickups as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=597.026s">So</a>  get your gloves on and pick up some trash in your favorite park. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=601.449s">We're</a>  doing a refresh of the mural up at the Mystic Dam. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=604.731s">So</a>  we do lots of art projects, like educational programs too, which is cool. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=609.755s">You</a>  could help out with anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=612.637s">We</a>  do invasive species removals. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=614.678s">So</a>  plants that are suffocating, like the native plants, we rip them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=618.781s">We</a>  bring people with a bunch of clippers and gloves and rip them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=623.524s">We</a>  do water quality monitoring so you can volunteer and you can learn about how we measure the water quality and get down in the water and look at samples there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=632.288s">We</a>  count the river herring and track their migration. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=636.31s">Yeah,</a>  and we have really cool events coming up this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=639.231s">So</a>  if you subscribe to our newsletter, you can hear about something every month and get involved in.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=645.173s">Yeah,</a>  I like the fact that there's virtually nothing that you do that you don't seek to hear the voices of the communities that are being impacted by whatever it is that you're talking about, whatever it is that you're planning and talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=664.518s">So,</a>  I know the big deal for the organization right now in terms of, you know, kind of planning projects and developing new strategies is our own Mystic Shoreline initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=682.075s">So</a>  would you like to enlighten us a little bit about that?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=685.847s">Absolutely,</a>  so the Mystic Shoreline Initiative is part of our Greenways program, so talking about the paths along the river or the parks too. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=696.156s">And</a>  in this project, it's been ongoing for a couple years, we're talking about the Mystic Lakes, the eastern shoreline and Mystic Valley Parkway, down past the Rotaries on High Street, all the way up around our beautiful West Medford shoreline to Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=711.39s">So</a>  that's our project area. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=713.791s">And</a>  through this project, we've also looked at roadway safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=717.833s">That</a>  came a lot more last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=719.314s">And</a>  this year, we spent a lot more time on the West Medford chunk of the shoreline itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=724.977s">So</a>  it's been a really cool process. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=728.139s">And</a>  I can dive a little bit more into the specifics of the project.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=731.94s">Yes,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=732.881s">But</a>  I want to give a disclaimer first. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=735.749s">I</a>  actually had the pleasure in the enlightenment of serving on the steering committee for one half of this shoreline initiative and now serving on the steering committee for the other half, which is <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=751.455s">What's</a>  happening here in West Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=753.416s">So</a>  I just want to want to let you know I'm a big fan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=758.257s">I'm</a>  a big fan of what's being discussed Okay, so take it away.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=762.378s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=762.859s">Yeah,</a>  and like you said, it's all community driven. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=765.419s">So</a>  we're glad to be chatting about it So basically, we know this is a amazing culturally rich area environmentally incredible <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=774.022s">historically</a>  significant for a lot of folks and we've also heard from a lot of folks in the community and the state and That there's some challenges there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=782.626s">So</a>  we're looking at accessibility So people being able to use the path with all like needs and we're looking at ecological improvements so when it comes to erosion of the paths or the way stormwater is affecting in the river and <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=797.372s">And</a>  we're also looking at recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=798.853s">So</a>  do we need more benches? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=800.495s">Stuff</a>  like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=801.315s">So</a>  that's our project right now, which is really awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=805.659s">And</a>  like you said, we have a steering committee, which is incredible, which is 14 people from the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=811.944s">They</a>  all have amazing backgrounds and stories related to the neighborhood and the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=816.948s">And</a>  we come together and we talk about, okay, what do we want to see here? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=820.673s">And</a>  we also dive in with maps and really get into the specifics. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=824.837s">We</a>  also bring it out to the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=827.68s">I've</a>  been putting flyers up if anyone sees them on the streets.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=830.844s">I</a>  did see one today.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=832.205s">Good,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=833.527s">And</a>  last night we had our second meeting that was public on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=836.97s">And</a>  so there we bring it to everyone and we say, here's our plan, what do you guys think? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=841.273s">We</a>  have people put their input right in Zoom, and if you can't make it to Zoom, you can fill out a survey after. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=847.458s">So</a>  we're trying to get as much comments as possible, and we've gotten thousands of comments of people's opinions on the idea, so it's awesome.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=855.13s">Yeah,</a>  and it may take a long time for it to happen, but in each case, the case from High Street down to the Mystic Lakes and slightly beyond that, as well as the case from this side of High Street and on down to Boston Ave, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=873.852s">both</a>  developments would dramatically change and enhance the way that people can use the resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=885.666s">I</a>  really believe that that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=890.33s">So,</a>  it's pretty extraordinary stuff, but it's also really, really ambitious, especially given, you know, kind of where we're at socially right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=903.154s">So,</a>  and you talked about there being some challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=905.574s">Can</a>  you talk a little bit more about what some of those challenges might be?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=909.232s">Yeah,</a>  so the current challenges that we're seeing along the path that people are bringing to us are a lot, a lot of comments about how it's a dirt path with a lot of roots and that just is not accessible for a wheelchair, for a stroller. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=923.203s">So</a>  kind of just like, what can we do to make this actual path more connected and accessible for everybody? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=929.028s">So</a>  that's one of our huge goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=931.51s">We've</a>  also been looking at traffic safety a lot and the tragic passing By the rotary this winter is absolutely raising how important this is in this area So we've gotten so many comments to about just making crosswalks like speed, but whatever we can do So that's also a huge thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=950.031s">We're</a>  looking at and <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=951.693s">and</a>  then with erosion, so looking at the actual shoreline environment, and do we have invasive plants, do we have places where it's just not constructed well along the river, so it's not good for the river or the land, so yeah, lots of great opportunities.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=969.082s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, so many things have come up in our discussions in terms of the steering committee, and the issue of parking, obviously, and then there, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=980.788s">you</a>  know, the issues of, you know, kind of noise and, you know, the abutters, you know, having some issues with, you know, some of the things that are, you know, going on during the summer and, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=993.917s">It's</a>  one of those you can't make everybody happy, but you try to find solutions that improve it a little for everybody and a lot for some folks, and hopefully everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1008.342s">So</a>  I guess the other thing is right now implementing expensive infrastructure improvements without having full control of the funding streams <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1022.022s">and</a>  the required state and federal supports, it puts us in a real bind in terms of predicting how soon these things can happen.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1032.829s">Absolutely,</a>  and it's the hardest question because with this work, you do kind of have to realize it takes years just to get a plan and then to get the plan approved and then to get stuff constructed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1045.538s">It</a>  takes so long, but my organization's role is pretty much just being the one to lead these <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1051.602s">Community</a>  processes and the meetings and the surveys and we're just collecting all the information so that eventually With obviously we can't promise anything, you know, you never really know but like what's important is just getting all this together so that we can hand it off and Hopefully see it through</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1069.5s">I</a>  mean, we at the community center really know about this first hand because we have been trying to provoke the powers that be, particularly the city of Medford and DCR in partnership, to make some improvements back out here so we could have two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1087.894s">One</a>  is a path across the DCR land to the street, so that people coming into the center from this side don't have to walk through mush and mud and snow, so that we could at least have a pavable path. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1103.293s">And</a>  then the other thing is safety issues and parking issues on Mystic River Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1110.777s">And</a>  we finally have pretty much all the nuts and bolts in place to have that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1118.561s">And</a>  fortunately, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1120.763s">it</a>  actually kind of went beyond what we're hoping and turned into a plan for basically from Harvard Ave all the way down to Fairfield Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1130.63s">So</a>  it's gonna make some pretty dramatic improvements overall in how people can experience this part of the geography that you guys are talking about with the Mystic River side of the PATH project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1147.122s">So</a>  tell me more specifically what kind of your public engagement process looks like.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1155.998s">Yeah,</a>  so it's been a really, really incredible process and I've had a lot of fun working on this because basically a lot of my job has been hanging up flyers and I've found nice, beautiful days. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1167.94s">I</a>  walk up and down, I walk through the neighborhoods and what we do is we have a steering committee put together, incredible folks with such amazing stories to bring and such great conversations across the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1182.103s">Well</a>  you know it's important to have like some comments about we love a natural feel to things you know sometimes people really love the dirt right hiking feel so how do we how do we honor that and how do we also add accessibility and it's a really awesome dialogue and we're so grateful to have community leaders like you on our steering committee.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1201.103s">I</a>  had never heard of a ramble until we started talking about how the natural path in some instances is preferable to anything that's really engineered. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1215.03s">But</a>  also to counter that was, and you mentioned it earlier, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1219.672s">all</a>  of the roots from the trees that can sometimes impact how that nice natural path can be accessed by people who have any disabilities, particularly that require a wheelchair or canes, crutches, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1237.737s">and</a>  so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1239.097s">So</a>  yeah, it's very interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1242.039s">It's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1242.919s">And</a>  people's different stories about like, well, one time I was putting my kayak in over here and or one time I was in Winchester and I saw this new bench. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1251.724s">Can</a>  we get something like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1252.844s">Like</a>  hearing people's specific input is so amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1256.526s">And</a>  it's really fun for me too because I get to listen to those conversations, then we open it up on Zoom and we invite all neighbors to come and chat with us and we get so many more comments there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1268.537s">Then</a>  we go back to our offices and read through them all and sort them out and we say, okay, we got 100 comments about the path, we got 60 comments about benches, signs, it's really exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1279.447s">I</a>  have some specifics for you if you're interested. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1282.449s">So</a>  we broke it up into three categories, so accessibility, like the paths and such, the environment, so the shorelines, environmental health, and the recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1293.912s">So</a>  we got 162 comments talking about safe roadway crossings, to no one's surprise, so that's a huge accessibility thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1303.475s">Also</a>  lots of comments about access to the shoreline, educational interpretive signage, which is really fun, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1311.097s">Okay,</a>  that was me Lighting maybe some wayfinding signage so like to show people where they're at some more like history stuff like that So that was really cool some specific comments We got were a lot about the bridges and the rotaries and just connecting the trails And also, yeah, like I have a stroller. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1334.342s">I</a>  have a wheelchair. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1335.102s">This</a>  is not accessible to me Like that's invaluable to hear for us and bring back to the project team. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1340.383s">Absolutely</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1341.784s">And</a>  then also when we looked at the environment, we got 70 plus comments about the beautiful trees, making sure we're protecting the trees along the path, maybe having some more trees or better maintained new trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1354.531s">We</a>  got a lot of comments about some native plantings. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1358.072s">So</a>  ripping out those invasive species that are crowding and having like a pollinator meadow or like plants that are there to sustain and natural to the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1369.138s">So</a>  lots of comments about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1370.299s">We</a>  got a lot of trash receptacle comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1372.94s">That's</a>  a huge one So yeah Really cool stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1377.563s">I</a>  love the idea of like incorporating public art memorials like information And then for recreation we got a lot of comments about having more overlooks so like intentional clearings to look out to the river so maybe just that's removing a little bit of the shrubbery at the bottom and opening it up a little bit more and <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1397.853s">Improved</a>  non-motorized boating access is a big one. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1400.995s">So</a>  that's such a question in our meetings is how do you let people put their kayaks, but it's not a jet ski. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1408.099s">That</a>  came up so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1410.62s">And</a>  yeah, some cool comments about the open lawn areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1414.203s">So</a>  like people sharing that they bring their dogs, how important it is for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1418.805s">picnic</a>  tables, all really cool, really cool stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1421.587s">So</a>  yeah, and we're still open to comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1424.529s">It's</a>  an ongoing process.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1426.13s">Absolutely,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1427.671s">So</a>  in terms of, so maybe folks can get an idea of some of the types of things that have kind of been teased out, especially in the plan from High Street down to almost to Winchester, or actually to Winchester, Wedgmere, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1447.663s">What</a>  kinds of things are, you know, have been scoped out in terms of implementation?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1454.267s">Yeah,</a>  so again, I have my notes here because there's a lot of great stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1459.149s">So</a>  we have a lot of, again, breaking it into like safety, accessibility, environmental, we have a lot of proposed safer crossings, which is huge, and our design team makes really cool maps where they show all this out, and you can find that on our website, which I'll plug at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1477.519s">But</a>  safer crossings was a huge one So they mapped out a bunch of areas where they thought it'd be good to have some safety improvements on the road We also have that Improved path so not a paved path, but like a stone dust That's better for a wheelchair user or something and maybe why they widening the path a little bit making it more like accessible and regular and like just a little bit more connected along the stretch and <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1503.62s">And</a>  then wayfinding signs, which I think are awesome some benches I think would be huge and yeah, maybe a scenic overview so like selective clearing of the Shrubbery to have some intentional spots to go and enjoy So those are some have some more <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1523.459s">info</a>  We have yeah picnic tables nature play which I think is cute like a Natural little like set of logs for kids to jump on stuff like that Non-motorized boat launches. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1538.612s">So</a>  just kind of formalizing where people are already putting their kayaks Maybe making some of the steeper sections a little bit more, you know <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1546.859s">regular</a>  The steps from Boston Ave that go down to the path that there's no steps It's just kind of like that weird block and you're kind of you feel like you're in someone's backyard Formalizing that entrance a little bit So yeah lots of really cool stuff and totally go on our website and check out the pictures Because that's such a good way to look absolutely put your input.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1568.991s">Yeah</a>  Fantastic Okay I <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1576.59s">Okay,</a>  so again, if folks wanna get involved, whether they're folks in the audience or folks at home, what would be the best thing for them to do?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1588.257s">Yeah,</a>  so for this process, we started last year and had our consultants and landscape architects survey the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1596.583s">So</a>  they looked at everything, took pictures, checked out the erosion, the roads, everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1604.048s">and</a>  then we went into our visioning process which is where I was saying we got thousands of comments and that was kind of just a What do you like? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1612.318s">What</a>  do you not like? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1613.239s">What</a>  do you think we should do? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1614.32s">What</a>  do you think we shouldn't touch? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1616.643s">So</a>  that process is really huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1618.204s">That</a>  was cool that was our first meeting to our first public meeting and steering committee meeting was just a <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1623.33s">Generally,</a>  what do folks have to say about this area? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1626.971s">And</a>  then last night, we had a meeting where we had these initial designs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1631.192s">So</a>  these are the maps that our team put together and it shows like, here's where we're proposing a new bench, here's where we're proposing a new crosswalk, stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1640.555s">And</a>  we presented this to folks both at the steering committee meeting and then the public meeting last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1645.756s">And</a>  also had an option for people to type if they support an idea, don't support an idea, have a different idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1652.918s">So</a>  our next step is going through all those comments.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1655.34s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1655.52s">Yeah</a>  a lot of polling a lot of polling but it's so fun because I like reading all the comments because it like I'm on my computer, but I feel like they're telling me about their walk along the path and I'm like But following that meeting last night We now have a survey open that has all these pictures and walks you down the short line and shows you the different proposed ideas and so you can look at each chunk and put <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1679.536s">I</a>  think this, this, and this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1680.756s">I</a>  don't like this, this, and this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1681.917s">You</a>  can put that on the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1683.417s">So</a>  that's our next phase, which is really awesome and really important to have everyone be a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1688.139s">And</a>  then we'll have a third set of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1690.999s">So</a>  it'll be about, we've gotten your feedback from our initial plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1695.481s">We've</a>  changed it a little bit based on people's input. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1698.361s">This</a>  is what we're finalizing and sending off to hopefully go to construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1704.183s">It's</a>  a really cool process, but June will be our last set of meetings, and you should go to our website and learn all about this, and then we can sign you up for emails to get info about it.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1714.49s">Absolutely,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1716.092s">And</a>  it's really a wonderful opportunity to have your voice heard on all of what is being discussed.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1725.624s">Yeah,</a>  and I will not forget, next week we're actually having an in-person option too, so if an online survey or meeting isn't the best, we're going to be on Thursday, April 24th, we're going to be at Duggar Park, or if it's raining, we'll be right in here, from 3.30 to 5.30, and we're going to have big maps out on the table with all this stuff, so you can just talk to us and we'll write down what you think. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1749.465s">And</a>  then Friday, April 25th, so a week from today, we're going to be at Shannon Beach in Winchester with the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1756.608s">And</a>  if that's a rainy day, we'll be at the Winchester Public Library from 4 to 515. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1761.81s">So</a>  write that down or go to our website.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1764.911s">Very</a>  good, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1766.152s">So,</a>  and here's the $64,000 question. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1770.035s">It's</a>  probably a lot more now, but what does the current state of racial reckoning and a growing retreat from a healthy dialogue about diversity, equity, and inclusion mean for the support of environmental justice in our community?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1786.025s">That</a>  is a huge question, but so glad you asked that because I think it's so important for us to all be thinking about that right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1795.068s">And</a>  my perspective is basically we have to just keep trucking and do what we can and just kind of like, you know, if we let the hopelessness sink in, then you're like, oh, I'm not going to go to this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1808.572s">I'm</a>  not going to, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1809.612s">Go</a>  to the shoreline and because I'm like what's gonna make a difference, you know And that kind of attitude is just like for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1816.299s">It's</a>  not not how we get through. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1818.522s">No,</a>  so I think this is a great example of like what can I do in my backyard my local river and <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1826.99s">That</a>  has some importance and meaning to me and I can't control The country I can't control the decisions of some people but I can control My input in my own processes like this and I think it's important to get involved because it helps Inspire you and connect you with people which is what we all need right now</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1845.865s">Absolutely</a>  agree too. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1847.126s">I</a>  think in anyone that has ever been out to, you know, count the herring or help deal with some of the, you know, the Japanese knotweed and all of these different invasive plants, you know, I think that that's the attitude that they've taken. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1865.179s">They've</a>  decided that they're not going to let <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1871.472s">you</a>  know, the affairs of the day, and the constant clanging of the newsreel keep them from doing whatever they feel like they can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1881.457s">And</a>  you, as an organization, giving them the opportunity to do these things is really a tonic for the spirit, because in a lot of instances, if there's no entity out there that you can kind of formally attach yourself to and say, okay, I'm with these guys over here, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1900.005s">And</a>  we're doing X and Y and Z, and we're making a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1904.069s">And</a>  I think that's one thing that Myra does extremely well, is it gives everybody a home base to come to and say, OK, well, we can go out and we can do this because Myra's going to be over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1916.842s">We</a>  can go out and we can do that because Myra's going to be over there.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1919.905s">Definitely,</a>  and I would say also working with places like the center and with folks like you all and it's like that's what inspires us and keeps us going is having partnerships with amazing other local groups and thinking what they say like Think globally act locally.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1936.149s">Act</a>  locally. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1936.689s">That's</a>  what we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1937.769s">You</a>  know Tip O'Neill said it best. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1939.77s">He</a>  said all politics is local at the end of the day all politics is local so <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1945.811s">even</a>  looking at it from a political perspective, we have to do what we can where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1955.094s">Oh,</a>  and speaking of which, I know that one of the platforms that you're diving off of right now, so to speak, is flood resilience. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1966.777s">Would</a>  you talk a little bit about that?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1968.677s">Absolutely,</a>  yeah, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1970.459s">So</a>  my job is to help support a lot of these projects with community input and stuff and also something that I've been working on in my role is looking at stormwater flooding in the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1981.551s">So</a>  that's a very early phases project and we're going to be working with the center and other folks across 10 different communities in the watershed <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=1990.8s">And</a>  basically our goal this summer is to just, similar to this process, reach out and find a bunch of people and have a big community party or something and get people talking about their experiences with flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2004.951s">And</a>  it's like I said earlier, where obviously it's a long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2008.794s">You</a>  have to be patient with what can we actually do about this when it comes to constructing stuff differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2015.48s">But</a>  something about my job is we're just in the information collection phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2020.043s">So</a>  this summer I'm going to be going out to different places like the center and around different communities and talking to people about where they're seeing flooding and I think it's really it's really a good thing to do because it's like again community conversations is how you get people <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2035.41s">mobilized</a>  and inspired, so I'm gonna bring back that information to my organization and push it forward again to, okay, now we've collected where all this flooding is happening, what can we do about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2046.8s">And</a>  that's something that I think is also just important, to keep gathering the information even if you don't know what you're doing.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2053.386s">So</a>  I have a follow-up question to that because, you know, I'm, and maybe it's just ignorance on my part, but I'm, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2061.975s">not</a>  aware of this area having had issues with the rising tide of the river and having the water come over into the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2077.879s">Now,</a>  have you seen evidence of this in the past?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2083.16s">Yeah,</a>  I should clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2084.561s">So</a>  specifically for this project, we're looking at stormwater flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2089.305s">So</a>  when it's raining like crazy and your drains can't hold it all and it's coming up or it's like you have a street that doesn't have the right drainage.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2097.212s">So</a>  we're not actually talking about the river overflowing its banks, so to speak.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2101.838s">We're</a>  not talking about that right now.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2104.199s">We</a>  should talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2106.161s">But</a>  yeah, it's all related, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2108.162s">That</a>  makes perfect sense to me.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2109.542s">But</a>  if people have stories about that, we need to hear that, too, because it all is related.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2114.385s">It</a>  is, indeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2116.386s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2118.428s">So</a>  this is kind of a corollary to the first question. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2124.471s">We</a>  have a seeming denial, by many, of a lot of bedrock climate science. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2131.735s">in</a>  the retreat from environmental protections and the aspiration toward dealing with these things better by the federal administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2145.086s">How</a>  does that kind of stuff impact your organization?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2148.565s">Yeah,</a>  so the way that I think is really helpful for me to think about it is when we're talking about climate change, so taboo sometimes, it's really helpful for me to phrase it without saying like, we're talking about climate resilience today. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2164.558s">I</a>  just say we're talking about flooding or extreme heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2168.3s">Because</a>  even if you're talking to people who are a little bit more like, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2171.863s">oh,</a>  I don't know if I believe in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2174.124s">It's</a>  like, do you believe that you're really hot this summer and it hasn't been this hot before? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2179.667s">But</a>  just because we don't have to draw it back to the science if people don't wanna do that, you can say, okay, the river is eroding or you're not seeing as much birds. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2189.511s">There's</a>  stuff that you don't have to say is climate but people can relate to and kinda gets the gears turning. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2195.734s">That's</a>  what's helpful for me at least.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2197.735s">So</a>  it ends up in a lot of instances being kind of terminology and how you approach it in terms of whether you talk to folks so that those who are, whether it's on the fence or whether they're outright deniers or whatever, they can kind of relate to it in terms that don't require them to think that, you know, there's an engineer up there who's trying to make them do stuff they don't want to do.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2220.746s">Absolutely,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2222.527s">Very</a>  good, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2224.287s">Okay,</a>  so I like to do this with my guests and hopefully we can play. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2232.809s">So</a>  I want to play a little game of word association. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2235.67s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2236.31s">Okay,</a>  and what I would like to do is I want to give you a word-word phrase and ask you to please give me a few sentences on what that word-word phrase means to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2246.292s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2247.432s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2247.833s">So,</a>  you know, and we've actually heard a couple of these words during the course of our conversation tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2254.085s">But</a>  so when you hear the term invasive species, what do you think about?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2259.218s">Okay,</a>  I think of like an evil monster that's like crawling and climbing and vining and wrapping around. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2266.586s">Because</a>  the way it wraps around native plants, it can literally choke out. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2271.591s">Like</a>  when I worked at the farm last year, beautiful stalks of corn getting suffocated by this vine and it's like, it's like a monster.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2279.419s">And</a>  what was the vine?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2282.542s">I'm</a>  so bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2283.183s">It</a>  might be bittersweet fine, but I'm not the scientist.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2287.646s">It's</a>  scary, it's scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2289.287s">All</a>  right, but physically choking out corn. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2292.39s">Yeah,</a>  it's scary, like a tentacle. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2295.132s">Wow,</a>  sounds like wrestling or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2300.616s">Okay,</a>  so jet skis.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2307.379s">I</a>  think jet skis are really fun for like Cancun or something, but I understand that maybe they're not what a lot of people want to see on their neighborhood river.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2320.084s">Yeah,</a>  kind of overpowering for the Mystic Lakes.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2323.325s">It</a>  might be, and actually my friend has a cat named Jetski because he's fast and dangerous, so I have to plug him too.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2333.673s">Okay,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2337.116s">Your</a>  namesake, Shannon Beach.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2339.533s">Oh,</a>  so my dad grew up in Arlington and he always tells us stories about how after his dinners when he was like 10, his great uncle or whatever would make him walk around the entire Mystic Lakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2353.338s">So</a>  I've had a lot of funny stories about Shannon Beach and I remember it used to be called Sandy Beach.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2358.72s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2359.24s">And</a>  I remember when they changed it, one of my other uncles was like, hey, you know, they called it Shannon Beach. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2363.922s">I</a>  was like, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2365.622s">But</a>  everyone else is kind of mad about it.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2367.302s">Yeah,</a>  well, everybody down here for sure was mad about it because, you know, that was we had always grown up with Sandy Beach and we didn't always have great stories about it because, you know, like when I was young, you know, we we got harassed and hassled sometimes, you know, going down to the beach because, you know, we look like everybody else. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2386.186s">But</a>  but we got over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2388.086s">We</a>  dealt with it, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2389.627s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2390.747s">Herring</a>  run.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2392.398s">Oh,</a>  the herring run. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2395.302s">I</a>  will admit, I have not been to see the herring. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2399.307s">So</a>  I just started in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2401.249s">But</a>  I think it's one of the coolest things that my organization does. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2405.434s">And</a>  I think it's so incredible because we've gotten like the biggest count in New England now, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2410.92s">So,</a>  and I think it's an incredible story of, like, there's so many beautiful indigenous stories about it, like, just the history of, like, the herring, it's incredible.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2419.846s">But</a>  I haven't actually seen it, so that's on my list for, like, this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2423.268s">Well,</a>  it's so, and the other thing is, it's so connective, connected to the history of, you know, kind of Native Americans in the area, because it was obviously a, you know, a great, you know, food source and food resource. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2437.937s">But</a>  it also, you know, just brings back all of the stories of how the natives really, really wanted initially to share the land and to be, you know, good neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2451.22s">And</a>  they were already good stewards and they already knew how to farm and fish and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2456.842s">And</a>  things didn't work out, you know, very well in their favor.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2462.004s">Also</a>  a beautiful story about resilience though because like as we keep connecting more and more fish ladders and stuff Yeah, it brings back the history and the fish remember the way, you know Well, I you know, I like the fact that you have so many people that come out to do this particular thing, you know when you have the</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2482.185s">the</a>  herring runs and you issue the call for folks to come out and count the fish, it's really cool that you have literally hundreds of people that wanna come out and count fish.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2491.351s">Yeah,</a>  and the volunteer slots filled up in three days.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2495.614s">Yeah,</a>  that's what I mean, it's pretty crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2497.755s">It's</a>  pretty crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2499.476s">Okay,</a>  so what should folks in our audience and in the watershed absolutely know about Myra?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2509.977s">Okay,</a>  I would say you should know that you're always welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2513.898s">So</a>  go online and find an email and just email someone if you're interested in their project or like our offices are right in Arlington Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2521.94s">Show</a>  up there, write us a letter, whatever you want to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2524.881s">Just</a>  come talk to us and we're always willing to hear your stories related to the river, the environment, hear your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2533.103s">And</a>  it really is a community-driven organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2536.566s">We</a>  have grown so much because of all the power of the community and the new partnerships we've made and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2543.173s">So</a>  just find a way or find one thing you're interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2546.055s">If</a>  it's fish, trash, climate, anything, just find your way and someone will love to talk to you and get you involved.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2553.682s">So</a>  they, and I'm not sure how it came into their possession, but the organization got this big old Victorian house off of Pleasant Street in Arlington, and it's really, really cool because it's like you're at work and at home at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2574.698s">I've</a>  been there a couple of times for our meetings and such, and even going to the restroom or whatever, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2583.345s">It's</a>  very much like being in your own home. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2585.887s">It's</a>  not at all like a business building, but it's real nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2589.891s">And</a>  they're very, very open and welcoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2591.753s">So</a>  just like if you walked through the front door and said, what's what, they would take the time to hang out with you and show you around and talk to you about whatever you wanted to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2602.783s">So</a>  it's real nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2603.624s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2604.504s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2605.105s">OK,</a>  so I want to give you the last word. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2607.868s">What</a>  are your parting thoughts?</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2609.9s">Okay</a>  parting thoughts are I'm just already feeling so inspired from this conversation and I hope you guys are all feeling a little awakened with the spring and everything happening and I think for me nature is one of like the best ways to just like re-center yourself with everything else we're dealing with right now like just go sit on the shoreline and you know <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2633.756s">Whatever</a>  you want to do like get together with a neighbor like right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2638.18s">We</a>  need that more than ever So just get outside talk to someone you'll feel better all right, very good, so I</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2647.683s">Shannon,</a>  really thank you so much for bringing a broad perspective and really fantastic organizational and ecological insight into this community in greater Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2660.233s">Obviously</a>  it's important work that Myra does and I hope that folks all over Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2666.253s">will</a>  become increasingly more aware of the watershed's importance, of its equity as a resource, and its health and safekeeping. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2675.481s">And</a>  to everyone that's been watching in the room, obviously, and also out there in TV land, as they used to call it, thanks so much for your attentiveness and your interest in our discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2686.63s">And</a>  thanks for coming along with us as we continue to refresh for greater flexibility and bringing the best stories and entertainment possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2695.417s">So</a>  get ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin right after we take a break to reset our stage, and I'll come back and share some WMCC announcements, and then we'll get started with the music portion of Words and Music. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2711.471s">Thank</a>  you, Shannon.</p>

    <p>[Shannon Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2712.311s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2714.033s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=2716.255s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3022.578s">Okay,</a>  very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3025.46s">Check,</a>  check. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3027.002s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3030.565s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3033.607s">Here</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3036.169s">Here</a>  we go.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3039.212s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3042.695s">Boom,</a>  boom, boom.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3051.472s">All</a>  righty. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3052.834s">We're</a>  about ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3054.035s">We're</a>  about ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3059.801s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3060.902s">We're</a>  good? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3061.423s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3065.154s">I</a>  wait to get my high sign from my man back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3067.715s">Okay,</a>  so more often than not, and I'm going to hold off to the end with all the promotional stuff and so forth, because I want to get into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3078.977s">More</a>  often than not, when we do Words in Music, we go out there and we beat the bushes and we find wonderful singers and we find, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3089.98s">outstanding</a>  musicians. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3091.842s">We,</a>  you know, we've got, you know, we're looped into the Berkeley community and the New England Conservatory community, and we get some amazing folks to come in, you know, and do stuff for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3105.795s">But</a>  it's Poetry Month. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3108.253s">And</a>  my bishop, my pastor, would say to us all the time, he would say, it's a sorry frog that won't praise his own pond. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3117.377s">So</a>  I'm calling my own number tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3122.179s">But,</a>  and I'm fortunate in this, I'm not doing it by myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3127.641s">Several</a>  years ago, I had the outrageous fortune to link up with this guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3135.344s">His</a>  name is Jonathan Fagan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3138.695s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3139.835s">And,</a>  you know, John kind of heard it through the grapevine that, you know, there was this poet guy out there doing some stuff that, you know, he kind of liked. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3150.94s">And</a>  we talked, and one thing led to another, and we started talking about a collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3159.583s">And</a>  the collaboration became what's known as the Ally Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3165.085s">And</a>  the ally part is obviously a throw to the fact that we were both seeking a way to make poetry and music address some of the social justice issues that we both really feel very strongly about. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3184.297s">And</a>  that's what it became. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3186.498s">And</a>  it became that to the effect that we developed this quartet <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3194.103s">And</a>  that's Greg Toro on the bass back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3199.447s">And</a>  our first drummer, John Dalton, real busy guy, doing a bunch of different stuff, and not always available to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3211.23s">But</a>  because Jonathan knows like a million musicians, he was able to find a great drummer that could step into John's shoes. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3223.353s">And</a>  we literally never missed a beat. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3226.713s">So</a>  back here is Gordon Angleguy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3231.224s">Okay,</a>  and it was cool because we, you know, Jonathan is also the founder of the Medford Jazz Festival, which has been going on for several years now, in which we've had for the past three or four years, here at the community center right out in our backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3249.214s">And</a>  this summer it's gonna be in August, I think it's the 16th and the 17th, and it's a don't miss thing, because this kind of stuff just doesn't happen in West Medford very often. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3260.9s">You</a>  want to be able to, you know, we set about 60 or 70 chairs back in the back, and the sun is shining, and oh man, it's a great atmosphere, and it's August, so it's still nice and warm and sunny. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3276.954s">So</a>  it's a Saturday and a Sunday afternoon, and it's free. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3281.601s">And</a>  you got access to Duggar Park, and there's refreshments, and we have a big time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3288.491s">So</a>  hopefully, you'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3290.594s">But</a>  anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3293.398s">we've</a>  been playing together for several years now, and we actually, we cut a record. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3299.86s">So</a>  over there on the table is a CD, if anybody still has a CD player, it's crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3307.263s">And</a>  it's called the Ally Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3308.783s">So</a>  a lot of what we do tonight, and there's some new stuff too, because I'm working on my seventh book, but a lot of it is actually on that CD. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3321.107s">So,</a>  Greg Toro, Gordon Engelgau, Jonathan Fagan, I'm Terry Cotter, and we are the Allied Project. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3331.052s">All</a>  right? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3331.453s">Can</a>  we play for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3333.374s">All</a>  right, let's do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3335.675s">Okay,</a>  John. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3336.836s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3338.216s">This</a>  first piece we're going to do is called Hired by the Mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3342.459s">And</a>  for me, as a poet in West Medford, this is kind of where it all started. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3347.421s">So,</a>  hopefully you'll enjoy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3351.902s">They</a>  gave my people the lowlands, and not much of it, just a few streets hard by the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3359.19s">Banks</a>  turned a blind eye behind the red lines, and it wasn't about the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3364.616s">Class</a>  was an irresistible force. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3367.94s">Race</a>  was an immovable object. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3371.82s">Perhaps</a>  it wasn't the written rule, but white folks knew the legal tool to keep us in our place in this mystic valley space, where slaves and rum and ships had built some mansions, made some millionaires, and hid some old money. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3390.535s">So</a>  it was hard by the mystic we went, muddy and a bit turned down, the only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3402.186s">But</a>  we named it, we claimed it, we made it our own. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3408.747s">Even</a>  in the heat of summer when the shores were parched and the soil was rank with the decay of aquatic alchemy, we were one with the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3419.69s">We</a>  followed its flow to the lakes and the sandy beachfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3424.091s">On</a>  our own Jordan shore, we baptized and blessed our brothers and sisters in Christ. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3429.378s">We</a>  caught the little fishes to go with our loaves of bread and became the teeming multitude who our Lord Jesus fed, hired by the mystic. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3441.803s">We</a>  became community. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3444.424s">We</a>  commanded unity. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3447.525s">We</a>  embraced the village and raised up our children in the way they should go. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3457.902s">As</a>  the river ebbs and flows, the tides will turn and our fortune grows. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3463.385s">A</a>  few more streets become our home. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3465.626s">Houses</a>  on Sharon join Kin on Jerome. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3470.488s">From</a>  Duggar Park to the railroad tracks, the white folks make more room for blacks. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3475.711s">The</a>  color line recedes a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3478.212s">Church</a>  and school and center fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3481.694s">The</a>  Ville becomes the heart of it, hard by the mystic shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3490.043s">Now</a>  the worm has surely learned and folks who left have surely learned things couldn't stay the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3497.909s">That</a>  muddy mystic most days is clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3501.011s">The</a>  banks are freshly cut and green. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3504.734s">Faces</a>  once distinctly brown are not the only ones in town. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3531.62s">These</a>  streets that once were our confines must now embrace what gentry defines, condominium culture, bedroom convenience, university sprawl, access, egress, invest, and dispossess. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3552.588s">Now</a>  those lowlands have become the highlights of a trending city. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3556.569s">And</a>  sometimes that success isn't pretty when it's at the expense of your black and brown and tan friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3572.794s">And</a>  yet, the river still turns and bends from where it begins to where it ends. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3581.07s">the</a>  only place where one could be brown in this ancient Middlesex County town. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3588.555s">But</a>  we named it, we claimed it, and made it our own.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3602.666s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3603.847s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3606.845s">So</a>  when I'm feeling nostalgic, I always go back to living in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3618.512s">I</a>  live in Randolph now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3621.513s">When</a>  my wife and I first got married, and we've been married almost 38 years now, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3628.877s">The</a>  first five years that we were married, we lived on Arlington Street in a rental apartment that some friends of my family had. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3637.499s">And</a>  loved it here in West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3640.7s">But</a>  she was working for, actually for Boston Water and Sewer at the time, and they pressed the residency requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3648.642s">And</a>  she was six months from getting grandfathered. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3652.723s">So</a>  we had to move into Boston in order for her to keep her job. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3657.085s">She</a>  liked her job. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3658.305s">I</a>  liked her liking her job. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3660.206s">So,</a>  you know, so we moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3663.227s">And</a>  we moved to Dorchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3665.708s">And</a>  we lived in two different apartments in Dorchester for about 17 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3670.85s">And</a>  then it was, you know, when we thought that we had all of our ducks in a row to be able to buy a house, we came back to Medford first to look. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3679.934s">Couldn't</a>  touch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3681.314s">Couldn't</a>  touch it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3683.155s">So</a>  we started looking. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3684.795s">We</a>  looked in Boston for like that long. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3688.637s">But</a>  you could touch, if you couldn't touch Medford, you definitely couldn't touch Boston, especially in the areas where we, that we were interested in. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3695.46s">And</a>  we started looking south and we had some friends in Randolph. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3700.101s">We</a>  started looking in Randolph and we finally found a nice place. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3703.263s">We</a>  have a nice little split level ranch with a big yard in Randolph and that's home. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3709.065s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3710.887s">Home</a>  is where the heart is, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3713.208s">So</a>  again, whenever I want to reminisce and think back to the good old days, I come back to my West Medford home. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3722.57s">And</a>  I work here during the week, and it keeps me connected. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3727.452s">And</a>  the beauty of it is that my mother, my father, and my baby brother all had cancer, and they passed away. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3736.374s">And</a>  I had it, but I beat it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3739.415s">You</a>  know, God is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3741.822s">And</a>  they're looking down on me and I hope they're proud of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3744.288s">But</a>  anyways. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3747.022s">It</a>  gave me an opportunity, coming back to work at the community center, to be in West Medford, to be with my family, to go through some of what they were going through, and to be there as a resource for them while they were going through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3760.59s">So,</a>  you know, they say, never curse the bridge that brought you safely over. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3766.653s">So</a>  I never, never curse West Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3770.235s">But</a>  I do care some of the things that have happened to West Medford that have made it less West Medford for a lot of folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3778.062s">So</a>  this is a little bit of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3780.304s">I'm</a>  not mad. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3781.705s">I'm</a>  just truthful. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3783.006s">This</a>  is called Corner Lot.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3787.37s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3788.671s">Getting</a>  a little bit of fuzzy fuzzy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3791.053s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3791.613s">We</a>  good? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3792.154s">We</a>  better? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3792.774s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3793.935s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3795.837s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3822.15s">standing</a>  at the apex of Arlington and Jerome, trying to remember the black and the brown and the tan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3829.333s">Ronnie</a>  and Otis used to live in the big house on the corner lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3833.175s">It's</a>  probably changed hands half a dozen times since then. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3837.737s">Current</a>  owner's been there for a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3840.098s">He's</a>  good with his hands and knows his way around wood and tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3844.0s">Place</a>  has been gussied up quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3847.021s">Picket</a>  fence is off-white, but if you know, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3858.14s">Asian</a>  kid in a Tufts hoodie just whipped by in a helmet and rollerblades. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3863.682s">Didn't</a>  see much of that back in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3866.542s">The</a>  university sort of hit on a hillside trying its best to be a baby Ivy. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3872.404s">But</a>  the cohorts come here all the time now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3875.085s">Basketballs,</a>  tennis rackets, and pickleball paddles in tow on bikes, benzos, and rollerblades. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3884.645s">We</a>  used to bust ourselves up pretty good on rickety metal skates with clunky keys and leather straps. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3891.006s">Nothing</a>  a little Vaseline and Mercura comb couldn't handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3895.347s">How</a>  did Henley put it in Invictus? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3897.728s">Oh</a>  yeah, bloodied but unbowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3906.91s">Not</a>  too many white and off-white kids hanging out down here back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3912.107s">It</a>  was as if the invisible lines once drawn to keep us in sometimes kept other folks out too. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3920.474s">Now</a>  they've pretty much taken over. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3922.656s">Duggar</a>  Park, the Rhone Tennis Courts, the Hervey Schoolyard, and a hundred addresses on Arlington, Lincoln, and Jerome. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3932.905s">A</a>  host of our remembered places, so few of our original faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3944.274s">Meanwhile,</a>  back at Ronnie and Otis's old place, I'm still standing like that centurion, knowing that Jesus doesn't have to go in to heal his servant. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3954.36s">He</a>  just has to speak a word. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3957.482s">I</a>  keep hoping that he'll speak a word to the Cornelot, too, and bring back the black and the brown and the tan. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3969.573s">Across</a>  the street is the river. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3972.174s">It's</a>  low tide, but the smell is gone and the grass is greener than I recall. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3983.237s">That</a>  was our little park, away from Duggar and a lot less hectic. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3988.198s">We</a>  had makeshift bases or discarded cones for football and softball. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3993.66s">We</a>  lost a few in the river, but nobody was going in that muck to retrieve anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=3999.937s">We'd</a>  probably wade in that water today. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4004.139s">They</a>  planted some trees there many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4007.38s">They're</a>  all pretty big now. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4009.781s">Maple</a>  and ash, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4012.602s">Nobody</a>  plays baseball or football there anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4016.243s">But</a>  there are lots of dogs frolicking off leash and gaggles of fat geese daring pitties, pugs, and poodles to chase them off. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4035.25s">I</a>  can't imagine my childhood without losing a few softballs there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4040.056s">I</a>  can't imagine not hearing Mrs. Allen calling James Michael to come eat, or little Charlie watching us play from his folding chair, because his spindly legs were too weak to let him run. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4053.725s">I</a>  can't imagine that I'm still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4057.446s">But</a>  Ronnie and Otis, Darryl King, Frankie French, Aaron McDaniel, and Marky Davis are all gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4068.131s">Everyone</a>  had a nickname back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4070.672s">Darryl</a>  was super fast, so we called him Road Runner and Jack Rabbit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4075.258s">Mark</a>  was thick as a big tree trunk, so we came up with oak for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4080.983s">Aaron</a>  was bud, Frankie was fruit man, and I was top cat. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4085.948s">Too</a>  cool, ran the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4094.175s">Everyone</a>  wants the corner lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4096.877s">Little</a>  more land, and perhaps the new perspectives that angles create. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4102.758s">I</a>  wonder if that meant anything to Ronnie and Otis, or Jed and Miles and Gib, Barry, Coco, Keith Wing, and Kenny Byfield. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4112.085s">It</a>  certainly meant something to the white folks looking to displace, transplant, and uproot the local color. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4120.531s">Black</a>  folks built homes here, only place where we were allowed to be, where they could color inside the lines Medford once drew against the perceived discomforts of darker skin. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4134.79s">We</a>  were here first. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4136.791s">First</a>  firefighters, police officers, war heroes, shop owners, tradesmen, postal chiefs, teachers, artists, and preachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4148.096s">We</a>  were the human bedrock of the only neighborhood they'd let us build. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4156.639s">The</a>  old church is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4158.961s">Nelson</a>  even changed the street number as if to erase the fact that the original Shiloh Baptist ever existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4169.867s">But</a>  if you know, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4173.269s">That</a>  corner lot still has a cornerstone. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4177.512s">And</a>  Nelson couldn't do nothing about it without a more draconian demolition. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4185.58s">two</a>  more condos in the house of the Lord, two more houses that us first folk can't afford, two more dismissals of the blessing of his word, one more holy stone rejected and ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4213.782s">Okay,</a>  nostalgia is hard sometimes, whew. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4217.544s">Okay,</a>  so, but it's also happy sometimes, so that's what this next piece is about. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4223.168s">And</a>  you may have heard it before, but you're getting ready to hear it once again more.</p>

    <p>[Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4229.192s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4233.115s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4234.776s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4237.698s">The</a>  Little Store, you're right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4242.035s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4242.837s">Good,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=4244.579s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Terry Carter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=5973.965s">It's</a>  not for you to tell your own story. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=5977.468s">That</a>  is the burden of your children. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=5980.23s">They</a>  must shoulder this yoke with love and loyalty. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=5985.234s">And</a>  yet, you have not gathered them and bid them sit before the campfires of their elders. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=5993.801s">You</a>  have not seasoned their meals with the spice of their identity and the savor of their names. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6001.027s">How</a>  will they learn to walk the walk and talk the talk? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6005.408s">How</a>  will they learn to tell your stories even as they live out their own? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6019.99s">Sons</a>  and daughters and heirs, if you didn't smell the burning ash or feel the warmth of the flame on your neck, you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6030.564s">If</a>  you didn't revel in the growl of the griot's earthy reply or the trill of the mockingbird's cry, you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6040.831s">If</a>  mama was too tired and daddy too long gone to carry the wood, light the spark, and stoke the flames, you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6051.279s">And</a>  until the lion cub knows how to tell the pride stories, the hunters will always tell them first. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6066.073s">The</a>  good book says, train up the child in the way they should go. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6069.916s">Will</a>  we let them depart from the community of faith and the city on a hill without the master's touch, without the oil of his anointing and his full measure of grace? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6083.363s">Will</a>  we not show them Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fufina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda, and Songololo's new tackies? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6111.588s">The</a>  prophet says he will encourage fathers and their children to return. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6116.811s">But</a>  how will they know the way home if no map charts the seas, measures the roads, sites, the peaks and valleys, and names each forest despite the thickening trees? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6129.639s">Will</a>  the burden of the elder stories be too heavy for the children? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6134.442s">Will</a>  they care to carry? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6136.847s">Will</a>  they dare to tarry? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6138.188s">Will</a>  they linger at the foot of the griot? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6141.21s">Will</a>  they hunger for the wisdom of the sage? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6149.737s">We</a>  must put them on the page, where hard work earns the man his wage, where power is measured by God's own gauge, where miracles scoff at the wand of a mage. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6163.1s">We</a>  must share with them the truth that is loyal and fierce, like Naomi and Ruth, that doesn't wait for the confessional booth, that has the bite of the panther's tooth. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6180.288s">This</a>  is a gift of legacy, where a glorious past sets the captives free, and a candle's light beckons liberty. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6195.338s">Sons</a>  and daughters and heirs, I bid you sit before the campfires of your elders, hear their stories, gather up their stones, and build up your strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6211.027s">They</a>  will show you Anansi's clever ways, Popo and Fafina's journey, Mufaro's beautiful daughters, the people who could fly, the wonders of Wakanda and Songololo's new tackies. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6226.911s">Soon,</a>  you will be the herald. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6230.218s">Write</a>  these things down on the tablets of your spirit. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6234.207s">Let</a>  them put a running in your feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6246.338s">With</a>  each quickening step, you repel the arrows of the hunter with the shield of abiding faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6253.886s">You</a>  capture the flags of your enemies and gather up their spoils. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6259.312s">You</a>  remain the lions of the pride and your tails will always be your children's brand. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6277.968s">You</a>  will never abandon the community of faith, though you build a thousand cities on a hill, drawing wonderous strength from the master's touch as the oil of his anointing fills your clay jars with his grace. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6304.187s">Cool.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6305.968s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6308.914s">A</a>  long while ago, I wrote this piece, and Ruth Youngblood, God Rest Her Gentle Soul, it was her favorite, favorite poem. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6319.502s">And</a>  whenever she would hear me, you know, or be somewhere where I was going to read poetry, she would always say, <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6325.766s">Are</a>  you gonna do the Barbie poem? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6327.167s">Are</a>  you gonna do the Barbie poem? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6328.949s">And</a>  the poem was called Barbie Doesn't Live Here. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6332.571s">I</a>  hope that Ruth is in eternity smiling down on us right now, because I wrote a corollary to that poem that I think that she would like as well, and it's called If Barbie Had a Choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6363.218s">If</a>  Barbie had a choice, I believe that from day one, she would have made it a black thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6371.227s">She</a>  would have ditched the creamsicle skin and gone with the lustrous ebony you. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6377.774s">She</a>  would have spoken with an evil dialect with a true queen's attitude and said, to hell with you colonizers. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6385.878s">package</a>  me up in a pink box with white lettering and a bunch of beachy palms and sand in the background? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6392.727s">I</a>  think not. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6395.991s">You</a>  can't get these ample breasts and these curvaceous hips into that Goldie Hawn psychedelic mini. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6405.037s">I'ma</a>  need a little something more substantial. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6408.04s">I'ma</a>  need copious yards of single-leaf cotton with shiny batik totems and all the colors of the motherland. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6417.088s">I'ma</a>  need a Wakanda seamstress straight out of the Ruth Powder School to hook the thing right and show the world what I'm working with. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6425.636s">I'ma</a>  need Maiden Dahomey, not by Mattel and Disney. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6433.317s">If</a>  Barbie had a choice, Ken would have looked more like Ali or Denzel or that fine ass dark chocolate British cat Idris Elba. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6443.843s">He</a>  would have been melanated, not barely suntanned. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6447.867s">And</a>  by no means would he have seen more holiday tissue wrap than 150 grit sandpaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6455.494s">He</a>  would have been swashbuckling like Marvel's T'Challa, woke like Tupac, and standing on business like Brother Malcolm. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6474.214s">She</a>  would have kissed that man with unretouched, un-botoxed, black girl lips, lush and full as a tropical rainforest. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6488.564s">She</a>  would have engulfed her man in every quaking inch of the last poet's black thighs. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6495.509s">If</a>  you don't know, YouTube it. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6498.251s">She</a>  would have no need for a Brazilian butt lift or a Beverly Hills boob job or an Adobe Photoshop session. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6505.996s">Mother</a>  Africa and a generous genome took care of all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6510.839s">You</a>  feel me? <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6519.382s">If</a>  Barbie had a choice, you would never have been able to buy her at Toys R Us, F.A.O. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6524.666s">Schwartz,</a>  or Mary Arnold's. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6527.048s">She</a>  wouldn't have been a fake trophy bride, a chick on the side, or a Bonnie for Clyde. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6532.231s">She</a>  wouldn't have been an American Girl Addie, a hot Lana Batty, or Dance Moms Maddie. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6537.775s">She</a>  wouldn't have been It Girl Margot Robbie, or Cherry Pie's Barbie, or P. Diddy Harvey. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6546.508s">I'ma</a>  close the flow with a few more rhymes, just a few bronze bars to end this on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6555.854s">A</a>  new newbie and Bobby wouldn't stand for nonsense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6559.136s">A</a>  brother's pursuit couldn't sit on the fence. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6561.717s">Her</a>  womanly wiles would be truly immense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6564.919s">A</a>  player would just find her game too intense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6568.041s">With</a>  never a true shot at love's recompense. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6572.695s">Though</a>  he might pull up in a Bentley or Rolls, he'd lose by a landslide at a real queen's pose. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6581.84s">A</a>  new newbie in Bobby would demand mad respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6585.623s">She</a>  wouldn't suffer abuse or neglect. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6588.224s">She'd</a>  fight for her own like a goji elite. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6591.726s">She</a>  wouldn't be tame, demure, or petite. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6600.927s">No,</a>  things would be different on this I make bet. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6605.428s">A</a>  pimp or a hustler would not be a threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6608.289s">As</a>  fine as the print on the national debt, her beauty and wisdom would not break a sweat. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6619.351s">That</a>  glitzy white Barbie might have a toy jet, but she hasn't landed a soul plane yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6626.373s">My</a>  African queen makes the real kings forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6633.445s">though</a>  she might wanna keep that fly pink Corvette. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6641.234s">All</a>  right, all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6643.857s">Greg</a>  Toro on the bass. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6647.113s">Gordon</a>  Angle, guy on the drums. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6649.376s">My</a>  man, Jonathan Fagan on the piano. <a href="https://youtu.be/xhLDG1FYiZI&t=6652.099s">I'm</a>  Terry E.
