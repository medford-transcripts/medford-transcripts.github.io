    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=0.743s">The</a>  39th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4.226s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5.727s">7</a>  members present, none absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8.71s">Please</a>  rise to salute the flag.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=24.5s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=37.983s">Justice</a>  for all, we have our tax rate public hearing, 16-768. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=42.044s">Tax</a>  hearing, legal notice, notice of public hearing, City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=49.872s">A</a>  public hearing will be held by the Medford City Council in the Howard F. Alden Memorial Chamber at City Hall, Medford, Mass., on Tuesday, December 13, 2016, at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=61.085s">The</a>  purpose of the hearing is to hear the Board of Assessors on the following items for the purpose of allocation of the fiscal year 2017 property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=71.888s">One,</a>  to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=76.79s">Two,</a>  select an open space discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=79.351s">Three,</a>  select a residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=81.752s">Four,</a>  select a small commercial exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=86.114s">Call</a>  781-393-2501 for any aids or accommodations, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=91.156s">By</a>  order of the Medford City Council, Edward P. Finn, City Clerk, Medford Daily Mercury, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=97.679s">November</a>  28th and November 5th, 2016 chair recognizes Ed O'Neill and Aleesha Nunley. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=109.161s">Ed</a>  O'Neill, our assessor, Alicia, our, um, uh, finance director for the city of Medford, uh, to address us on the proceedings. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=118.924s">We've</a>  met twice in the past two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=121.547s">in</a>  committee of the whole and report it out favorably to consider the four questions before us.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=130.61s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=132.751s">As</a>  chairman of the board of assessors, I am respectfully appearing before your honorable board body tonight for the purpose of holding a public hearing to discuss the following items concerning the allocation of the fiscal year 2017 property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=147.596s">Number</a>  one, to determine the residential factor to be used <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=151.062s">for</a>  fiscal year 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=153.583s">By</a>  selecting the minimum residential factor, percentage of the total tax levy will be shifted from the residential taxpayer to the commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=164.668s">This</a>  results in a lower tax rate for residential properties and a higher tax rate for commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=173.011s">Historically,</a>  the council has chosen the minimum residential factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=176.813s">If</a>  this is, once again, the council choice, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=179.702s">The</a>  minimum residential factor is .903265. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=186.787s">Number</a>  two, to adopt an open space discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=189.789s">This</a>  does not apply in the city of Medford, but a no vote is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=193.951s">Number</a>  three, adopt a residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=196.853s">If</a>  adopted, owner-occupied residential properties may receive an exemption of up to 35% of the average residential value. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=204.398s">This</a>  is accomplished by shifting a portion of the tax levy <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=207.394s">from</a>  the owner-occupied residential properties to non-owner-occupied properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=212.518s">Since</a>  this shift causes a higher residential tax rate, a number of owner-occupied properties would also see an increase in their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=221.203s">Number</a>  four, to adopt a small commercial exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=224.706s">If</a>  adopted, commercial properties housing a business employing 10 or less people and valued at less than $1 million may receive an exemption of up to 10% of their assessed value. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=235.626s">This</a>  is accomplished by shifting a portion of the commercial industrial tax levy from these eligible properties to other commercial industrial properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=244.912s">Since</a>  this shift causes a higher commercial industrial tax rate, all commercial industrial not receiving the exemption would see an increase in their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=253.577s">As</a>  part of this hearing, it is the duty of the board of assessors to notify the council of any excess levy capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=260.101s">Fiscal</a>  year 2017 excess levy capacity <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=264.246s">is</a>  $96,627.99. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=265.806s">For</a>  you, Mr. President, we'd like to go through the, uh, the handout that the council received, um, explaining the various, uh, parts of the tax classification hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=289.831s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=291.553s">Refer</a>  to the table of contents. <a

href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=326.837s">Number</a>  seven, the seven package evaluation summary or history percent of land use change, the average assessed value of surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=335.46s">Number</a>  eight is the LA-13 form, which is the new growth form. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=339.182s">Number</a>  nine is the tax dollar

exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=366.684s">To</a>  you, Mr. President, I'd like to open up some discussion on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=370.366s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=372.807s">Just</a>  for the public's information, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=378.953s">the</a>  council met for over an hour last week and, uh, for 45 minutes, uh, this week with the, uh, assessor and a finance director and review and a consultant last week, the city's hired consultant on these matters, uh, to, uh, review these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=397.324s">Uh,</a>  we did, uh, as we, uh, tend to do, um, uh, some significant research and analysis of figures regarding the resident, uh, exception, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=408.815s">uh,</a>  exemption issue and, uh, looked at that in, in quite, uh, a bit of detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=415.678s">So,</a>  uh, if you have anything more for us, uh, Mr. O'Neill, or if you'd, uh, like to have some questions from the Councilors, otherwise the chair will, uh, await a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=436.805s">and</a>  also a reported out of the committee report. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=439.065s">Uh,</a>  the clerk just pointed out to me, uh, we're asking for a report to come to us, uh, to learn the total amount of tax dollars that are tax deferred. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=451.468s">And</a>  those tax dollars are, um, uh, people who are eligible for tax deferment under certain circumstances pointed out in statute. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=460.229s">And</a>  so that was part of our committee report and we're awaiting that report, uh, for the future, but it's not, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=466.408s">conditioned</a>  upon our deliberations here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=469.729s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Lerner.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=471.729s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=474.67s">Mr.</a>  O'Neill, if maybe we could go over. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=477.171s">I</a>  know the information we have is a great deal, but there were a couple of people that did call asking what the new rate was going to be and also, you know, what the increases were going to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=488.294s">So</a>  maybe you're the best to go over page nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=491.775s">And</a>  I think that's the simplest way to put it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=494.476s">People</a>  want to know <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=495.403s">what,</a>  what will their property taxes go up and how much will that be? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=498.385s">Um,</a>  so I think that's an important page. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=501.486s">That's</a>  very understandable.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=503.067s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=504.308s">Uh,</a>  through you, Mr. President, uh, page nine is the, uh, if the, the council adopts the residential factor, uh, of 0.9 0 3 2 6 5, that would, um, with the existing levy of 105 million, 43,572 dollars and 1 cent. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=524.337s">it</a>  would yield a residential rate of $10 and 56 cents and a commercial industrial personal property rate of $20 and 46 cents, both going down from last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=536.524s">Um,</a>  so if he took the average single family, which is 475,910 per single family at the, at that, uh, proposed rate of 10 56, the average increase for a single would be two 79 93 cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=544.629s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=553.399s">The</a>  average condominium was $362,561 at the $10 rate would yield a $271.34 average tax increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=565.128s">And</a>  that's average from last year's averages to this year's averages. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=568.991s">Some</a>  would be lower, some would be higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=571.733s">The</a>  two families, the average assessed value was 554,641 at the 1056 rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=579.707s">would</a>  be, uh, two families would be $169 and 13 cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=582.829s">Uh,</a>  it's a little bit lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=586.051s">Um,</a>  I believe the two families increased last year, so the average was already a little bit higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=591.654s">Um,</a>  so it's a little bit less of an increase this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=594.296s">The</a>  average three family at 600, 672,212 at the $10 56 tax rate would be an average increase of $401 and 34 cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=598.058s">Again,</a>  that's average from last year to this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=607.807s">And</a>  the commercial industrial at $1,227,988 at $20.46, the average increase would be $426.58. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=616.674s">So</a>  what we've seen a little bit is the residential rate, residential appreciation factor as a class has gone up 10 to 12%, whereas the commercial industrials are about 7 or 8%, 9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=635.53s">So</a>  that's why it's less of an increase for the commercial industrial. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=639.973s">So</a>  those will be strictly averages.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=643.115s">So</a>  the, um, the reason for the drop in the rate is because of the assessments being higher this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=650.3s">Um,</a>  cause the rate, the rate last year was 11 19 for residential and 21 82 for commercial, but because the assessments are higher, the rate has gone down. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=663.955s">But</a>  the properties will still see an increase in their taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=668.237s">And</a>  then the fiscal year 2016 levy was $4.2 million less. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=670.118s">Last</a>  year's levy was $100,854,325.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=689.344s">The</a>  levy has gone up with the 2.5% and the new growth for about 4.2, correct?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=700.226s">And</a>  my next question, we had a long discussion last week and then we followed up this week with additional information you provided us, thank you, with regards to non-owner occupied properties and the potential vote we have with regards to the shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=718.949s">adopt</a>  a residential exemption, which in the past we've always voted against due to the fact that with the recalculation over 1,000 homes would also, if we made the shift to non-occupied, we'd also hit any home that is valued over 648,000, which totals about 1,050 pieces of property that would get hit extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=749.257s">I</a>  just think that's important for the public to know because we do get a lot of questions of why we don't do the shift compared to, I think you said Malden, the breakeven point was about 450, 500,000 and they only shifted to about a hundred parcels compared to Medford that would be over a thousand. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=766.189s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=768.03s">Their</a>  impact on the high end, the breakeven was 480 and it was just over a hundred parcels that would be affected. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=777.391s">where</a>  the break-even point is 650, 648 to 650, depending upon the percentage of the residential exemption adopted, which is maybe higher break-even point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=788.677s">The</a>  number is higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=789.578s">It's</a>  1,057 at 20%, 1,057 at 15%, 1,063 at 10%, 1,084 at 5%. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=790.618s">So</a>  what that means is anyone over the 648, 650, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=809.045s">is</a>  seeing an increase in value anyway, and potentially an increase even with the rate dropping. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=814.987s">If</a>  this party approves a residential exemption, they would also see another bump up because the rate would change. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=820.208s">So</a>  they would get the residential exemption, but they would also pay more in taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=824.629s">So,</a>  um, to summarize the residential exemption, the larger portion of properties below the breakeven point would receive a tax break at the expense of the higher value properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=838.86s">The</a>  non-owner occupied the apartment buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=843.125s">So</a>  that's the decision by this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=847.351s">The</a>  tax policy decision, you want to treat the city as a whole or do you want to take care of a certain class of properties? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=853.358s">And</a>  that's where the. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=855.023s">conflict</a>  is in voting this one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=858.104s">In</a>  other communities, they have different situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=862.105s">They</a>  might not have a high-end district, a high-end value. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=870.647s">Their</a>  primary class might not be in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=873.167s">It's</a>  the single families, the primary class. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=875.128s">Other</a>  communities, it might not be the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=877.588s">Could</a>  be condominiums, could be two families. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=880.109s">So</a>  there's a number of factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=881.249s">That's</a>  why there's only a handful, 15 communities have adopted it so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=885.438s">It's</a>  not a uniform percent for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=888.659s">So</a>  somebody pays the burden. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=890.699s">And</a>  you'll see that in the commercial, same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=892.52s">If</a>  you try to give a certain segment of the commercial properties a tax break, that burden gets shifted to the other parts of the commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=901.662s">Industrial</a>  doesn't, it'll come into play in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=905.463s">So</a>  somebody has to pay the levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=907.788s">And</a>  these are just options that you can shift burdens amongst them. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=912.489s">There's</a>  a, Dr. Starello used to say he'd like to have a single tax rate and everybody would pay the same thing and there'd be nobody, no special class benefiting one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=923.332s">But</a>  since classification, I believe in 1981, the city has voted to the maximum shift of 175.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=934.454s">And</a>  I agree, thank you, I agree with <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=937.606s">the</a>  fact that we have to increase the levy and we have to, we need the levy obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=944.889s">But</a>  isn't it true we're going to increase it 4.2 million, but on average, especially the last four plus years, we've put 1 to 3 million into our free cash at the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=959.115s">In</a>  essence, good to have some reserves, but we've built up our reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=963.417s">We're</a>  at a free cash of almost 10 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=966.33s">We</a>  have Water and Sewer between $8 million and $10 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=970.212s">So</a>  at some point, will we be giving—I mean, I've questioned that the last two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=975.854s">I've</a>  put motions forward to reduce—to not tax to the max and possibly reduce the levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=983.618s">So</a>  is that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=984.418s">We've</a>  put $1 million to $3 million into our free cash every year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=989.641s">I'll</a>  defer to Alicia on this.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=992.622s">Your</a>  Honorable President, through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=996.869s">Not</a>  every year, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=997.849s">Within</a>  the last three years, yes, based on the analysis that I have given you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1002.413s">And</a>  when doing the free cash, it is one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1006.016s">It</a>  is not something that you will see every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1009.458s">So</a>  I think that the city is being fiscally prudent in the way that they are generating and keeping their free cash and using it as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1015.983s">They're</a>  not just expending it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1021.51s">In</a>  2015, we put almost $2.5 million into free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1024.371s">This</a>  year, we'll probably put in close to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1028.673s">2014,</a>  looks like over, you know, $1.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1033.115s">Isn't</a>  there a point where we should say, okay, we'd really like to put a million in each year, but anything over that, we maybe should be giving the taxpayer a little break?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1042.418s">I</a>  think that the city is using it like reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1044.999s">I</a>  know that one of the Councilors put forth a fiscal policy talking about stabilization. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1050.118s">So</a>  it's putting money aside, they're just keeping it inside free cash as reserves and used as necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1055.081s">I</a>  know the mayor has plans for some of that money, but she's very fiscally prudent, and as was the mayor before, in keeping reserves for the city.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1065.046s">Is</a>  there a point where the mayor wants to keep the reserves too? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1068.348s">I</a>  think we've asked that question in the past, because one wants to build up her reserves, but there's also people that obviously can't afford their taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1078.232s">complain</a>  to us that they can't afford their taxes, senior citizens on fixed income that we probably would like to give a little break to if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1085.477s">And</a>  I think, and I questioned this the last two years, I think at this point we probably can.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1091.381s">Through</a>  the chair, I believe that's understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1094.403s">And</a>  this is where I would have Ed step in is it's very, if we used $500,000, it's very minor in the impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1104.611s">It's</a>  very minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1105.531s">Whereas</a>  to the city, depending on what kind <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1108.34s">a</a>  project or if something happened unforeseen, they have those reserves ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1112.301s">They</a>  don't need to go out and borrow.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1120.803s">For</a>  you, Mr. President, um, please take that a step further. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1124.344s">I've</a>  done the analysis, uh, and distributed to the council and their package and Friday, the various scenarios. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1131.526s">And,</a>  um, as Alicia stated, it would be the impact, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1139.083s">For</a>  every $500,000, it would be 5 cents on the residential tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1143.745s">So</a>  every million, it would be 10 cents. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1146.367s">So</a>  $2 million decrease in the levy would be a 20 cent reduction in the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1152.229s">So</a>  it's a minimal impact versus having reserves set aside. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1162.114s">And</a>  that was in your handout as well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1164.415s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1165.036s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1165.356s">I</a>  requested those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1168.801s">Thank</a>  you for providing those to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1170.342s">I</a>  think minimal to one person might not be minimal to the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1173.423s">$25</a>  for a single family. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1175.904s">This</a>  is just a $500,000 decrease to the levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1178.926s">I</a>  mean, you're still talking about $125 for each commercial property that's seeing an increase of over $300. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1186.149s">It</a>  may be minimal to somebody, but there are businesses out there that are obviously struggling too. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1192.652s">So</a>  that, based on the fact we have in the <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1198.017s">tax</a>  recap, fiscal year 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1201.439s">I</a>  mean, we are averaging our actual receipts for 2016 as the same for 2017, which we expect to come in for 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1210.704s">So</a>  we don't account for any increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1214.726s">And</a>  the biggest one, I guess, we've already discussed it at our Committee of the Whole meetings, is the new hotel that came on board in mid-2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1224.01s">So</a>  there's six months here that really isn't calculated for <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1228.163s">We</a>  have actual receipts in 2016 of $462,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1231.004s">And</a>  then we're placing our estimated receipts at $462,000 as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1237.447s">And</a>  I believe, you know, meals tax goes up marginally every year, et cetera, et cetera.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1242.63s">So</a>  we base it on what we actually received. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1247.032s">We</a>  didn't want to be too aggressive because if you go above what you receive, you have to justify that to DOR. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1252.395s">And</a>  then if we didn't reach that, we'd have a problem with DOR. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1256.036s">So</a>  we have to match. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1260.613s">Through</a>  the chair, may I also in addition on the free cash as well, I just want to point out that the mayor also does have plans to use that for a futurely proposed police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1270.499s">She</a>  wants to use free cash to fund that debt.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1274.008s">Has</a>  she given you any paperwork for us to submit tonight with regards to a plan on that?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1278.731s">No,</a>  she just had a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1280.352s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1280.892s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1281.333s">You</a>  don't have to say through the chair.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1282.453s">I</a>  don't think to the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1285.695s">I</a>  have had a discussion with her. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1287.056s">She</a>  did tell me that she does have a plan for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1289.157s">I</a>  don't have paperwork with me, but she did tell me that is what she's planning to use some of the free cash for us to fund the debt.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1296.726s">did,</a>  I mean, we, we've got the capital plan, but it didn't look like it was until 2018 and there's really no specifics given to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1305.028s">So</a>  that might've been, you know, pertinent information before we made, took any type of vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1310.409s">Um,</a>  cause I'd like to see a commitment of the, you know, the police station as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1314.77s">I</a>  think this whole council would, um, and I haven't heard any specific dollar amount of it's, it's always been when she met with us, it was that we were going to go out to bond for the 18 million.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1325.73s">She</a>  told me her plan is for a proposed $20 million police station that she's going to use free cash to pay for that, that she's for the debt, for the debt proposed.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1336.177s">So</a>  she told you she's going to use the 20 million out of free cash.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1338.638s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1340.019s">She</a>  said for the proposed police station that will cost around roughly $20 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1346.443s">She's</a>  going to use free cash to fund some of that debt.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1358.283s">That's</a>  my questions for now, thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1372.237s">No,</a>  we don't, we don't have any open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1374.019s">We</a>  have no open space in the whole city? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1375.26s">Classified</a>  open space, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1377.442s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1398.206s">I</a>  would just like to precede that motion and request that we reduce the tax levy by 500,000 based on the estimated receipts being, being low and the fact that we're putting millions into free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1410.012s">Um,</a>  and I was, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1411.293s">We</a>  were, I believe I was told that the police station would be bonded after 2018-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1415.434s">So</a>  I would just like to put that motion forward.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1419.434s">Is</a>  that SB paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1420.635s">Whereas</a>  we have a paper here that's immutable.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1424.615s">I</a>  looked at, that's the contradict. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1427.076s">So</a>  that paper is always called first. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1429.556s">I've</a>  done it the last two years.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1431.457s">So</a>  your motion is to reduce the levy by, so I have it correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1441.917s">It's</a>  five zeros. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1444.318s">I</a>  think there's a citizen that wants to address us before the, uh, uh, vote takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1451.141s">Mr.</a>  Citizen, please step forward and state your name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1455.563s">Welcome.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1456.843s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1458.144s">So,</a>  um, Andrew Castagnetti, cushion street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1466.087s">You</a>  usually I'm very prepared with some sort of statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1470.856s">It's</a>  the owner occupied real estate tax exemption because I'd like to see that happen here for the first time ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1477.963s">However,</a>  due to family circumstances and I don't have, I'm not privy to all the paperwork on this year's proposal from the assessor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1489.053s">So</a>  therefore I'm going to have to ad lib this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1492.096s">Please</a>  bear with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1501.693s">In</a>  a nutshell, I've been here five years, standing every December when you set the tax rate, and I am pushing for the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1515.541s">They</a>  do this in Somerville, Everett, and in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1519.884s">And</a>  I would like to see us get the automatic 20% advantage for our owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1530.859s">as</a>  long as the council votes for it in majority and also the mirror says yes and you automatically just meal it, send it into the state house and it's automatically approved up to 20% other cities around here that are bordering us are at higher than 20% they asked for a special exclusion up to 35% and maybe others are at even 37.5% <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1560.337s">Last</a>  year I made my first ever petition presentation and similar matter document. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1568.5s">S</a>  15-seven nine four. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1571.281s">I</a>  made a petition by Andrew P Castagnetti 23 asking that the council to adopt mass general laws chapter 59 section five C for owner occupied real estate tax exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1588.258s">Thank</a>  you for allowing me to present that prior to your vote last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1594.201s">Also</a>  in September of that year, prior to the, the great debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1603.805s">And</a>  actually this finally was asked during the second great debate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1610.988s">And</a>  I believe I probably had this published and Escobar's method transcript. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1616.67s">And</a>  this is a question, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1618.453s">I</a>  wrote up date of September 30th, 2015 question for all city of Medford politics and candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1629.216s">Are</a>  you for or against the home on owner occupied real estate tax exemption? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1634.737s">Go</a>  to Commonwealth Massachusetts website referred to mass general laws chapter 59 section five C one Massachusetts cities are <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1644.515s">already</a>  presently given this real estate tax savings to its owner-occupied homeowners. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1650.877s">This</a>  includes three bordering cities, Malden, Everett, and Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1654.938s">My</a>  question is, why not here in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1658.359s">For</a>  the past 40 or more years, our real estate tax bill in Medford has increased over 2.5 percent per year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1668.543s">If</a>  this automatic 20 percent exemption outlined in <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1674.023s">Chapter</a>  59, Section 5C, is adopted, the average owner-occupied homeowner, if you live on that one house, would receive a $200 savings a year instead of the usual $200 increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1688.912s">That's</a>  a $400 swing times 12,000 owner-occupieds. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1695.616s">Those</a>  are tens of millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1699.419s">Again,</a>  I am asking, why not here in this city? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1703.906s">I'm</a>  asking all city council and mayoral candidates to respond to this question before the upcoming election so that the voters have ample time to read your responses and cast their ballots for candidates who support tax relief for the citizens of our fair city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1723.873s">Please</a>  send your written response to the method transcript, letters to the editor, and to We the People. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1730.815s">Thank</a>  you for your attention and your response <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1733.649s">submitted</a>  by Andrew P. To this day, I have not received any responses in writing to the transcript or to me personally. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1747.678s">It</a>  just seems to me that this is way past due to give our middle class some tax relief for the first time ever in my lifetime that I know of. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1759.305s">The</a>  $650,000 push <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1762.603s">valuation</a>  would be slight increases above that with the adoption of what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1771.853s">And</a>  below that, they would all save money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1776.819s">In</a>  a nutshell, they would save $200 to $300, not having today's numbers, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1785.73s">And</a>  opposed to the opposite direction, so you're talking like $500 to $600 swing difference, again, times 12,000 owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1792.973s">That's</a>  tens of millions of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1797.555s">It</a>  seems kind of sad to me that we cannot help the middle class, because the middle class, in my day, as a youth, dad worked, mom stood home, took care of the kids, and bought a house, saved money, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1815.99s">Today,</a>  if both people are working at what kind of job, I don't know, whatever benefits they may not have, they can't have a hard time paying their bills, let alone saving. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1833.016s">So</a>  if the middle class is going to continue in this direction, on one shoulder, they carry the rich that don't want to pay taxes or refuse to. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1846.412s">And</a>  then on the other shoulder, they're carrying citizens or non-citizens who are getting checks from federal government, who can work, but maybe refuse to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1863.416s">So</a>  if you collapse the middle class, I believe common sense would dictate that we wouldn't have a society worth a damn. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1874.778s">And</a>  then? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1875.677s">there</a>  might be the second revolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1882.342s">Maybe</a>  Bernie Sanders made a good point once upon a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1886.145s">He</a>  was telling me about this so-called rigged system. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1891.749s">And</a>  I remember one astute individual once said, we can have democracy in this country, or we can have a few capitalists control most of the wealth, but we can't have both.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1910.135s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. Andrew.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1912.216s">Simply</a>  put, why not us? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1914.057s">The</a>  ball is in your court, in the mayor's. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1917.979s">People</a>  need relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1919.98s">Thank</a>  you if you're listening, and I have a whole box of thank yous if you do something positive, up to the 20%, which is automatic, and the numbers tell the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1931.987s">The</a>  average homeowner is gonna save 200 instead of pay $200 more for the first time ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1940.844s">think</a>  of those hundred dollar bills, $20 million worth.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1955.174s">Um,</a>  actually Mr. President, I was going to go item by item, um, by voting yes to, uh, adopt the lowest minimum residential factor and then the next <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1965.401s">Motion</a>  would be on the open space discount, and the next motion would be on the residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=1970.145s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2474.476s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2478.097s">I</a>  am happy to say, as the president has said, the city has been successful in receiving a grant of $250,000 federal land and water conservation grant funds that are actually administered through the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2489.982s">So</a>  we're very fortunate to be chosen because of our successful track record, really working with the state on various public spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2498.904s">This</a>  project is a renovation of the Riverside Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2502.085s">It's</a>  that land area where the bus shelter is off of Riverside Avenue and River Street and Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2507.986s">Mayor</a>  Burke has worked with residents, as I know many of you councils have also, to identify the desire for people to be able to have a location in Medford Square that is vibrant, where they can exercise their cultural interests, their artistic interests, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2528.506s">and</a>  create some type of a recreational resource that allows people to gather, congregate, and have activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2534.388s">It's</a>  the main focus of this renovation is to really bring vitality back to Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2540.27s">And</a>  of course, that's not all that's going to be needed in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2542.871s">We've</a>  been talking about the renovation plans and the master plan for Medford Square, which is underway with MAPC, working with the mayor's office to identify the other guide <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2553.245s">guides</a>  and the infrastructure improvements and things, business development, things that we need in order to make Medford Square more competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2559.751s">But</a>  this is something that's a little bit more fun, but it's necessary also. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2563.614s">The</a>  idea to have a place where people can actually socialize at Medford Square, be safe, be well lit, to be attractive and to be a place where you can now, you know, be yourself and socialize, whether it's teenagers or young children with their families, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2580.593s">people</a>  who are working in the downtown area just want to go get a sandwich at Medford Square and sit down at a bench and eat their lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2586.317s">So</a>  I think this is a great project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2587.978s">I</a>  hope you agree with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2589.76s">The</a>  paper before you asks that these are all necessary as part of the grant application. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2594.142s">Ask</a>  the council generally, I won't go through all those things that the president did, but they require the acceptance of the grant and appropriation of the $550,000, which is the budget, the project costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2606.05s">The</a>  council has received a presentation on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2608.636s">It's</a>  in schematic, which is basically, it's generally an idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2611.758s">It's</a>  not completely designed to the level of specification of construction documents, but it's enough to give you a sense of what the components of the project will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2620.263s">Components</a>  of the project will have seating, fixed seating and movable seating so that there could be some congregation of people for various activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2628.627s">There</a>  will be areas where there could be some tents that people could put up in order to sell their wares or have some things like the farmer's market or sell people who are selling jewelry or things that they've perhaps made. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2638.828s">There'll</a>  be a little stage area for some small performances by people who have more talent than I do in order to perform music. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2646.389s">And</a>  there will be some components that are park-like, but it's not really a park. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2651.31s">So</a>  perhaps it'll be a musical instrument that a child could go up and touch and just make some noise and express themselves in that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2658.331s">And</a>  there's been requests to add some fitness-related recreation equipment that will be included also. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2664.092s">So</a>  I think I've touched on each of the key components of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2667.856s">It's</a>  a lot to be programmed in a very small space, but we think that it will be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2672.942s">This</a>  application also requires that this land be preserved in perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2677.467s">There</a>  was questions about what that meant, which I believe the city solicitor did answer, and the committee of the whole meeting, and that that park be placed under the care and control of the park board. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2687.904s">The</a>  final is the authorization for the treasurer to do the borrowing and to utilize the money that is received under the bonds in order to fund the project costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2696.471s">So</a>  that's generally what's before, excuse me, before the council tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2701.015s">We</a>  are supposed to get this grant approval from the council into the state by the 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2707.119s">I</a>  know it requires several readings. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2709.161s">I</a>  think if they have an indication that the council's moving forward in a positive manner on this, that they would accept that this paper came in in the first week in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2716.76s">So</a>  I ask you for your

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2718.461s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2718.881s">And</a>  as Lauren mentioned, uh, we discussed this in two committee of the whole meetings and we had a number of our, uh, concerns addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2727.287s">And</a>  we also had, uh, by way of a special visitor from the office down the hall, the city solicitor, uh, wonderful and clear discourse on the concept of, uh, uh, perpetuity as applied within this document, as opposed to, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2746.602s">other</a>  applications of the word.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2750.065s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2750.565s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2752.247s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2753.368s">Mr.</a>  President, over the past year, I've attended many, many meetings in this, uh, in this building, uh, with the revitalization reference square and other parts of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2764.578s">Um,</a>  and what I hear is that the, uh, the businesses in the downtown area are looking for something, uh, to happen and happen soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2774.386s">And</a>  I would hope with the implementation of this project, maybe this will be the catalyst to hopefully get the project moving at maybe a quicker pace and to let the business people see that the city is serious about doing something. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2793.05s">I</a>  was able to talk to the developer last week that was here from, I should be the gentleman who was running the meeting last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2800.192s">And</a>  I expressed some of my concerns to him about how, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2804.723s">The</a>  businesses aren't coming to these meetings because they don't see anything happening and they want to see something happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2811.228s">And</a>  like I said, hopefully with the start of this, maybe this will send the message to them that, uh, this is the start of something and maybe we could, uh, train it up a notch and get, and get the project moving a little faster. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2824.157s">So,</a>  um, I would support this, uh, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2831.483s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2831.883s">So</a>  on the motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2834.45s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2836.311s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2837.691s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2838.252s">DiLorenzo,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2839.272s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2839.532s">Crosby,</a>  if she's still here, thank you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2841.773s">The</a>  last couple of weeks really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2845.015s">This</a>  is an interesting project, Mr. President, and I think that it's a good approach for us to take in a way to address a need in our downtown district and also begin to revitalize Medford square. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2855.779s">When</a>  we look at this project and this plan, it falls in line with some of the goals that are outlined in our open space and recreation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2862.393s">Um,</a>  it also allows us to take an underutilized and underdeveloped portion of our downtown district and put it under the control and jurisdiction of the parks commission, which allows us the opportunity to better control the use at that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2875.563s">Mr.</a>  President, right now it's just an open public space, a public sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2878.726s">Uh,</a>  there's no anti-loitering ordinance in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2881.248s">I'd</a>  question is whether or not that would even be something that the city of Medford could implement as being legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2885.971s">Um,</a>  however, when we have a public park in the downtown, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2888.917s">We</a>  can put restrictions around that public park. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2890.879s">We</a>  can say that people can't be in the park after dusk. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2893.142s">We</a>  can say that this area cannot be congregated in for certain times. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2896.205s">We</a>  can permit the area for use, for certain specified uses, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2900.21s">So</a>  I think that this is a great approach to addressing several of the issues that the community is facing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2905.415s">We</a>  need some passive recreation areas in our downtown district. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2909.549s">We</a>  have an opportunity to now connect the nice sitting area in front of Century Bank, with a nice sitting area in front of the Salem Street Burial Ground, with a nice sitting area in front of the Senior Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2919.792s">With</a>  any luck, the Clippership Connector is going to come through and we'll be able to traverse right into McDonald Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2925.994s">So</a>  I really think that this is the beginning of the city creating its own Emerald Necklace, similar to that of the pathway system that the DCI has established, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2935.297s">So</a>  with that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2937.381s">this</a>  is something that I'll be supporting this evening and I move approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2940.423s">So</a>  on the motion of approval by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2950.168s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2951.128s">And</a>  I want to thank Lauren and her office for working on this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2955.11s">It</a>  was roughly a year and a half, two years ago, I offered a resolution before this council that was unanimously supported to repurpose the bus shelter <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2967.064s">that</a>  is at the existing site currently that was dilapidated and falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2973.026s">So</a>  I'm happy to hear that the officer community development has worked on this particular project to revitalize an area that I admit is a tough area, a tough location where it's nestled between a busy, too busy streets and a cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2990.931s">And</a>  I can appreciate all the work that went into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2994.632s">The</a>  one concern I do have, which I've raised, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=2997.41s">at</a>  the committee, the whole meeting is the funding mechanism. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3001.472s">And,</a>  um, this project is a total cost 550,000 of which, uh, the city has applied for a federal grant of 250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3009.556s">The,</a>  uh, stipulation of the grant is that, uh, this property can only be used for recreational purposes, open outdoor recreational purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3023.343s">And</a>  it does say in perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3025.404s">So</a>  we had the city solicitor, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3027.667s">uh,</a>  attend our meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3029.648s">And,</a>  uh, he gave an answer, which I think, uh, caught some of us by surprise, uh, cause, uh, in perpetuity to me means forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3040.072s">And,</a>  uh, I still believe it means forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3043.213s">And,</a>  uh, in order to receive the grant from the federal government, uh, we have to assure the federal government that this property will only be used for that purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3053.537s">And</a>  I, as one member of the council, knowing that, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3056.956s">Uh,</a>  we have a $9,709,000 in free cash on hand at this particular time that, um, I don't want to see any restrictions on the reuse of that particular parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3070.326s">And,</a>  uh, I think, uh, allowing, uh, the use of the grant, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3076.13s">I'm</a>  all in favor of getting grants and I wish the city would seek more grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3081.153s">Uh,</a>  but the stipulation of, uh, having a piece of property that's centrally located <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3086.694s">in</a>  our business district in the midst of, um, the, uh, method working metropolitan area planning, uh, commission working on a master plan with the city to revitalize our downtown business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3101.12s">I</a>  think that we have to be more prudent and, uh, in my opinion, uh, using free cash to pay for this particular project would be prudent would be a way that we could see this come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3114.127s">and</a>  would be a way to accomplish all our goals as the director of community development mentioned about creating open space, creating a gathering spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3124.75s">If</a>  you look at the 2005 report that was issued that the city commissioned for the revitalization of Medford Square, it outlined a need for a gathering spot in the downtown business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3137.173s">And</a>  I think this addresses that particular need. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3139.894s">So</a>  I support the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3141.935s">I</a>  think it's a great project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3143.391s">However,</a>  the funding I do not support and I don't think we should handcuff ourselves on any type of language that talks in perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3152.195s">Um,</a>  we heard tonight, uh, the city solicitors say, well, perpetuity doesn't really necessarily mean perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3159.458s">Uh,</a>  if need be, you may need to only pay back the original grant amount if you want to change the reuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3167.041s">So,</a>  uh, you know, I, I don't feel comfortable as one member of the council, uh, accepting the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3173.405s">um,</a>  and feel that we should use free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3176.066s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3177.487s">Um,</a>  I would also, uh, ask that, um, in addition to, uh, looking at that parcel, uh, Mr. President, and I'm sure the, um, master plan committee is also looking at the parcel here located behind city hall, uh, which is in the parking lot of the hotel, but it's the parking lot of the hotel, the old roots parking lot and the parking lot directly out here behind city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3202.942s">uh,</a>  for potential growth within our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3205.784s">And,</a>  um, so, uh, based on that, Mr. President, based on what I heard from the director of community development saying, well, this is the mayor's proposal and this is what she's pushing through and this is how it's going to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3218.593s">Otherwise</a>  it's not going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3221.075s">Um,</a>  I believe that it's up to this council, uh, if we see fit, uh, to use free cash, uh, in order not to restrict ourselves on the land use of that particular site. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3233.283s">I</a>  think that's the way we should go, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3235.404s">You</a>  know, it's great to say Parkland, and we're going to put it under the Park Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3239.966s">The</a>  Park Board has a whole 20, 30-page document, what restrictions on Parkland. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3246.689s">And</a>  we're going to be opening ourselves potentially up to, if someone wants to go down there and use the particular piece of property for a short period of time, that they need to reach out to the Park Board and get a permit and pay for a permit <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3262.123s">to</a>  use a particular piece of open space within the heart of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3267.424s">And</a>  I, as one member of the council, do not favor that, Mr. President, and would ask my colleagues to at least consider the option of using $250,000, Mr. President, in free cash to pay for what the grant would have paid for, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3287.429s">So</a>  that means our total would be $550,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3290.482s">uh,</a>  in moving this worthy project forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3293.003s">So</a>  I would offer that in the form of a resolution, Mr. President, that, uh, the council as it be paper council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3299.587s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3299.987s">The</a>  council, uh, use, uh, the appropriation of 250,000 from free cash to offset, uh, the grant that, uh, uh, would have been used, uh, for the purpose of, uh, building this particular, uh, parkland, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3321.49s">Mr.</a>  President, may I? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3324.311s">You</a>  may.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3325.592s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3326.132s">On</a>  that, on that, uh, item there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3328.593s">First</a>  of all, uh, what I had said was the mayor's put forth the proposal that you hear to the council tonight, which is a request for her, a bonding of the full amount of money with a 50% reimbursement money that is not repaid unless of course the city were to do go ahead and decommission that as Parkland somewhere down the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3345.301s">Usually</a>  anytime you take a grant, if you don't, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3348.475s">live</a>  out the life of that public improvement, you're required to pay those things back. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3352.378s">So</a>  that $250,000 that the councillor is suggesting can be used for other purposes in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3357.542s">This</a>  is a 50% reimbursement grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3359.884s">I</a>  just want to be clear about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3361.846s">And</a>  the paper before you is with the funding as I proposed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3367.671s">I</a>  hope that's what you vote on.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3370.013s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3370.933s">Chair</a>  recognizes Vice President Ogunkar.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3374.877s">Thank</a>  you, President Dela Rousseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3377.044s">My</a>  question, I understand Councilor Marks' point and it was cleared up to me by City Solicitor Rumley who said the use could be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3386.699s">Now,</a>  if we change the use in five years, do we have to pay the federal government back?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3390.558s">It's</a>  very likely that if you didn't live out the purpose of the park and the perpetuity that you would have to pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3396.4s">And</a>  federal grants with CDBG funds, if somebody is borrowing money for us, the public improvement is five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3402.183s">So</a>  it's some reasonable period of time they would require you to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3406.345s">But</a>  I mean, I think the intention here really is clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3410.746s">And</a>  that is an open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3412.127s">It's</a>  a small space, as I said, in the Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3414.368s">The</a>  idea is to create more spaces and to protect them for this kind of purpose, for recreation, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3420.093s">and</a>  open space and cultural purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3421.915s">I</a>  mean, I think that's clearly an important part of this project is that we make a commitment in Medford Square to these components of what we think is going to be important to create a vital downtown area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3436.346s">And</a>  I really don't think that there may be things, uses on that park that you may wanna change. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3441.29s">Maybe</a>  you wanna change equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3442.951s">Maybe</a>  you wanna permit somebody to do some type of consumer sales for a certain period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3448.495s">But</a>  the idea of creating a space and having it there, I don't really see as a five-year commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3453.939s">I</a>  think that's a commitment of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3457.042s">And</a>  I think that as you make this vote, that's what you say. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3460.764s">You</a>  say you're making a commitment to public recreation and cultural spaces in Bedford Square.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3467.239s">Okay,</a>  and then with regards to the $550,000 grant, was there ever any discussion with regards to accepting the grant but taking the $200,000, going out to bond for $300,000 and then taking $250,000 out of free cash and then reimbursing free cash?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3483.227s">The</a>  mayor proposed that it go off a bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3485.008s">I</a>  did not have any discussion with her about other sources of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3487.729s">I</a>  assume that she had the bigger picture of the budget and that this is what she was recommending. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3491.611s">So</a>  I accepted what her recommendation was and I did not question it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3495.671s">I</a>  just ask because, again, I believe with regards to the police station, that was mainly going to be a bond, and the reason why, and I'm not quoting the mayor, but when we were in our meeting, the reason why it was several years out is because we're waiting for things to come off the books so that we can put the police station on the books with regards to the bond books. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3522.525s">this</a>  is, is a great project, but it concerns me that we're going to, if we're going to get additional projects before we get the police station proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3531.609s">Um,</a>  so that's why I asked, I think if it, if we had 250 come out of free cash and then reimburse, you know, mandate that we reimburse free cash, that might be a way to put less money on the books bond wise and eventually hopefully do the police station sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3547.217s">So</a>  that's why I didn't know if that,</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3549.505s">I</a>  didn't realize she was still here.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3551.186s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3551.806s">Be</a>  my guest.</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3552.927s">Through</a>  the chair, I don't understand what you mean about reimbursing free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3557.629s">What</a>  I see here is a $250,000 grant being awarded that she wants for a $550,000 project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3565.493s">So</a>  about half the project would be funded through the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3569.175s">Right,</a>  but we have to fully fund $550,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3570.736s">Correct,</a>  and I think she put in the bond, and as you stated earlier, she has that capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3577.605s">in</a>  addition to the capital improvement plan, she also has planned that police station and to pay the debt on the borrowing of the police station, she's going to use free cash.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3588.69s">Maybe</a>  on a side motion, if we get clarification with regards to the plan on how we're going to, um, what the plan is, even if it's not for another couple of years, per the mayor's proposal to us, what that plan is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3601.816s">Cause</a>  I'm, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3602.816s">hearing</a>  two different things in the last couple of months with regards to how we're going to move forward on the police station.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3608.018s">So</a>  if we get clarification from the administration's office, that'd be great paper to, for the mayor's office to clarify to the city council, uh, regards to funding mechanisms that she anticipates will be used to, uh, deal with the police station project for the 20 million.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3623.803s">Yes,</a>  please.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3624.624s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3625.704s">And</a>  my question, Mr. Clark, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3629.605s">And</a>  your motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3630.226s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3632.154s">If</a>  we go out to bond for the full 550, do we have a commitment that once we get reimbursement, it's going to go towards that bond?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3639.156s">I</a>  think that's part of the paper that's used for the proceeds and I think that was at the end of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3644.898s">Number</a>  seven, does that address your concern at number seven?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3656.482s">Maybe</a>  applied.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3659.33s">So</a>  you want the $250,000 reimbursement to go toward the cost of the debt?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3664.073s">Yes,</a>  I would make that a recommendation.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3666.015s">I</a>  think you can make that recommendation.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3668.817s">Once</a>  we get the reimbursement for the $250,000, we pay down the bond immediately. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3672.879s">We</a>  don't use that for the general fund and keep the bond open $550,000 because we are going to need to be able to go to bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3680.885s">We're</a>  not going to have $20 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3682.927s">We're</a>  going to have to go out to bond for some portion of the police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3685.809s">I</a>  thought it was going to be the full, at least $18,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3688.325s">So</a>  maybe once we get clarification, we'll know more.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3693.387s">So</a>  we have a motion for approval by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3700.811s">As</a>  a B paper, we have a motion by Councilor Marks that $250,000 for this project be taken from free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3711.456s">And</a>  we have a C paper before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3713.975s">by</a>  vice president Lungo-Koehn, uh, that the mayor report back to the council, uh, as to the, uh, details of the funding, uh, mechanisms she uses, uh, intends to engage, uh, for the purpose of construction and design of our anticipated, uh, new police station. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3733.766s">And</a>  that it is further resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3735.527s">And</a>  I forget that last distinction you made that the $250,000 <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3741.2s">being</a>  immediately reimbursed upon reception from the state and federal authorities.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3751.347s">And</a>  while I have the floor, I don't know if Councilor Caraviello is going to speak, but I think it's extremely important that it be heard loud and clear with regards to police presence in all our parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3762.114s">He</a>  made that point in our Committee of the Whole meeting, and I think it's extremely important. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3767.125s">And</a>  with regards to maintenance, we've had an issue for years with maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3770.748s">And</a>  I hope that if this does get approved tonight, that we not only the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, but we make a commitment to upkeep this piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3778.755s">And</a>  the last comment I'm going to make is the safety of our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3782.958s">There</a>  is a daycare that may be using this piece of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3785.94s">And</a>  I think it's seven toddlers to one adult. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3791.205s">It's</a>  a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3791.985s">We</a>  want to make sure that they're away from the street and well protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3796.615s">from</a>  the traffic that is in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3798.436s">But</a>  otherwise I think the project is going to definitely be an improvement for our square and be very, um, used by all.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3807.063s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3808.224s">Counsel</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3809.425s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3809.745s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3810.626s">And</a>  I thank the vice president for bringing up that point about the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3814.228s">I</a>  mean, I know I can't add it into this, but, um, during the construction of this, uh, and before I get sent, I am going to insist, uh, that, uh, uh, that we have a police presence, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3826.356s">there</a>  on a full time basis during the hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3831.477s">But</a>  we have, we have three sitting areas now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3834.978s">And,</a>  um, again, there are some, if you, if you're in the square on a regular basis, there is some, uh, quite a bit of undesirable element there at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3844.04s">And</a>  your remarks are part of the committee report that will be reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3847.82s">And</a>  I hope that the mayor would take that into consideration next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3851.321s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3852.301s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3852.661s">So</a>  on the seat paper Councilor,</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3856.501s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3857.422s">Um,</a>  at the public hearing I attended, um, there were many residents that were interested in particular from the art community of building a small structure, uh, on that particular site that could be used year round for art events to host, um, indoor and outdoor art events. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3878.619s">And</a>  apparently that was not, um, part of any other discussion, uh, other than that particular night. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3886.693s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, it was raised by many people that actually perform and do functions that pavers, the ground, pavers are not adequate for such an outdoor space. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3902.616s">And</a>  there was many concerns about trip and fall hazards and the maintenance of pavers and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3908.837s">And</a>  from what we were told, I guess the designer prefers pavers <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3916.185s">I</a>  think that's still as part of the proposal, because we haven't seen a formalized plan yet, but is that still part of the?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3924.646s">So</a>  two things, if I can respond to those. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3926.947s">Number</a>  one is we did look at a building structure that was looked at in the plan, and it was not included for two reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3932.768s">One</a>  is that a building would take up the entire space, and there would not be any room, open space for people to perform in. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3938.989s">And</a>  the second was because of cost, the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3942.309s">The</a>  landscape architect is preferring the idea of pavers, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3946.422s">but</a>  she does have to test has to still convince us that they can be constructed in a way that are not going to create an accessibility issue or, um, create some other issues, but they are preferred usually for a textural elements is what she's looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3961.106s">So</a>  they are in there currently is in the estimate for papers, but that may change as we move into actual design development beyond schematic design.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3970.609s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, at the committee, the whole meeting, uh, I brought the fact that, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3975.978s">this</a>  area will be used by, uh, a lot of different, uh, residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3981.061s">Uh,</a>  and, uh, it's geared in my opinion towards, uh, younger children, uh, for many of the activities that will take place there and many of the potential uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3991.388s">Um,</a>  and, uh, I would ask that where Riverside Ave is such a very busy traveled, uh, road, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=3999.224s">and</a>  is a place where buses queue up waiting to take off, that some type of perimeter roping or fencing, similar to what was done across the street at the Crystal Campbell Park, Mr. President, be placed around the perimeter of that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4023.064s">And</a>  I realize it's not going to stop people from exiting <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4029.645s">or</a>  entering, but it will act as a deterrent, Mr. President, potentially for young children not to run into a very busy street of Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4040.832s">The</a>  second question I have is regarding the grant itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4044.515s">And</a>  typically in grants, they'll ask for a maintenance plan and what the expectation is of the community to maintain this particular site. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4056.548s">And</a>  I was just wondering if Lauren can shed some, um, light on what our maintenance plan will be, uh, knowing that, uh, our DPW staff is at bare bones currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4068.03s">And,</a>  uh, we've added over the last couple of years, several new, uh, open spaces and park areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4075.012s">Um,</a>  and I'd like to hear from the director of community development on what, uh, was put in the grant as in regards to maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4083.294s">If</a>  there was any commitment on behalf of the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4085.767s">and</a>  what the actual maintenance plan is if there is one.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4088.649s">They</a>  have not asked for a maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4090.431s">We</a>  have not developed a maintenance plan yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4092.212s">That</a>  will usually be done as we move forward to design, depending on the materials and the type of equipment that we do have, but clearly does, uh, add additional responsibilities on DPW, which I think, uh, uh, you know, there'll be an evaluation as to whether they're able to do that themselves or whether that's going to require additional contract labor, but that will be developed as we move ahead.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4113.179s">So</a>  just so I understand, you're saying the grant did not ask for any type of maintenance plan?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4116.341s">It</a>  did not ask for maintenance plans.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4119.643s">So,</a>  so we're getting a $250,000 grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4123.226s">Uh,</a>  the federal government, and maybe that's why the federal government's in the shape it's in, is not concerned how the city of Medford is going to maintain the money that they're putting forward for this grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4134.113s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, um, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4141.787s">That</a>  should have been part of the proposal that was submitted to us on how this particular property will be kept up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4150.755s">And</a>  I'm disappointed to see that, even though the federal government didn't ask, that there's not a plan in the works to show how we're going to maintain this particular piece of property.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4159.643s">Well,</a>  I'm sure we can develop a maintenance plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4161.564s">First,</a>  we have to get the funding approved and move ahead with the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4164.227s">So</a>  first step is first. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4166.048s">And</a>  I don't think I'm beyond first step yet.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4169.111s">Well,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4169.765s">you</a>  know, if the city of method had a great track record on maintaining its properties, I'd say, you know what, that's probably not a bad idea, but all you need to do is come into this building and look at the roof that's leaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4182.57s">Uh,</a>  go down to a condemned DPW yard, go into a police station that, uh, the firefighters are actually picketing out front of city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4191.313s">Uh,</a>  I'm sorry, the police are out front picketing at city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4195.275s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4196.087s">You</a>  know, a library roof that's leaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4198.528s">Um,</a>  you know, so a lack of maintenance has been a part of the history in the city.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4204.091s">Mr.</a>  President, we can develop a maintenance plan.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4206.772s">So</a>  that is a concern, Mr. President, that I think we should see up front before we spend $1, Mr. President, uh, of any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4215.976s">Um,</a>  and you know, free cash is a bud. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4219.338s">Uh,</a>  all it is is a buzzword for taxpayers money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4223.72s">That's</a>  all it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4224.4s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4224.893s">Don't</a>  let anyone believe that there's free cash lying around, that there's no such thing as free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4231.136s">This</a>  is taxpayers' money, Mr. President, and a thorough report should have been submitted to this council regarding what the maintenance plan would be before we take any vote, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4242.383s">So</a>  I explain my vote on this, Mr. President, is based on the funding and the tying of the city's hands, not just for this council, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4254.323s">but</a>  for future councils and future generations in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4258.724s">I</a>  don't think it's as easy to back out from the federal government as we're hearing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4263.885s">Don't</a>  worry if you decide to use it for another purpose in a few years from now, five, whatever it is, just pay them back.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4270.227s">I</a>  don't think it's that easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4271.587s">I</a>  don't think anybody's making a trite statement here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4275.768s">Nobody's</a>  making a trivial statement here about maintenance or about the investment of public money. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4282.234s">the</a>  art, the, the, the, the, what the paper is before you is to actually save 50% of the cost by accepting a grant instead of using the free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4290.237s">So,</a>  I mean, that's, I understand your concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4292.278s">You</a>  have some legitimate concerns and I think that they can be addressed.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4769.926s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4771.567s">Anybody</a>  else in opposition? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4773.248s">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, I declare that portion closed and recognize Councilor Knight, Chairman of Licensing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4781.7s">And</a>  Mr. Zoning and we asked the petitioner to come up and tell us about their project.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4787.862s">How</a>  you doing, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4794.204s">Thank</a>  you for coming this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4795.165s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4796.005s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4796.425s">Um,</a>  in looking at your application, it appears that the paperwork's in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4800.326s">It</a>  looks like, um, what you're petitioning for is to open up a commercial, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4805.713s">business</a>  in an industrial sector, uh, an industrially zoned sector. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4809.515s">It's</a>  looks like it's about a 20,000 square foot facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4813.276s">Um,</a>  looks like you're requesting hours of operation from 9am to 9pm. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4816.678s">Maybe</a>  you guys can just go from there and kind of fill us in a little bit as to what it is you're trying to do over there.</p>

    <p>[Brian Dugdale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4821.219s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4821.56s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4821.88s">Thanks</a>  very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4822.86s">Uh,</a>  counseling Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4824.161s">And,</a>  uh, thanks for your time here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4826.041s">Um,</a>  we have a tenant coming in Petco, which is a general pet store, uh, general retailer, uh, to be clear that we, we, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4835.18s">are</a>  here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4835.96s">We,</a>  after we had the tenant approach us, uh, we met with commissioner Moki. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4840.461s">We've</a>  been in touch with commissioner Moki in connection with an ongoing redevelopment of the, of the metal Glen mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4846.962s">Um,</a>  the metal Glen mall for those familiar with it, we've got a Coles at one end and a Marshall's at the other end. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4852.003s">And</a>  the interior space, what had been the interior mall space is being renovated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4856.244s">One</a>  of those spaces, which about 20,000 square feet would be occupied by, uh, this retail tenant Petco. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4863.185s">Uh,</a>  we, when, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4864.357s">We</a>  spoke with Commissioner Moki. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4865.838s">We</a>  went through the proposed use and looked at the history of the Meadow Glen Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4870.12s">There</a>  had previously been a pet store located at the Meadow Glen Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4873.322s">And</a>  this is a technical requirement that we're seeking to fill here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4877.104s">To</a>  be clear, there's no overnight boarding of dogs or cats or anything of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4881.146s">We're</a>  only talking about small animals, things of the nature of fish, small birds, small mammals, things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4888.77s">No</a>  overnight boarding of any dogs or cats whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4891.972s">I</a>  want to make that just clear for the record.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4895.388s">Um,</a>  as a pet store, um, can you explain to us whether or not you fall under the local control about border health or, um, as a pet store like this, uh, governed more by state regulation and state code?</p>

    <p>[Brian Dugdale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4909.458s">It's</a>  governed by both actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4910.619s">So</a>  there'll be licensing at both the state and, and the local level. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4914.041s">Uh,</a>  one of the requirements or the special permit, which, uh, we'd submit that we meet will the, the actual pet store operator will have to comply with all local board of health regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4924.463s">In</a>  addition, they'll have to be approved and licensed and approved on an annual basis with annual inspections by the Department of Agriculture. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4931.049s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4935.793s">And</a>  how many full-time jobs are going to come with the approval of this facility?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4941.618s">Paul</a>  Sincotta with New England Development. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4944.14s">They'd</a>  be about 25 or 30 full and part-time jobs.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4950.372s">And</a>  can you tell me what an average annual salary is for someone that works in a Petco? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4954.133s">I</a>  mean, are we talking that? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4955.173s">It</a>  doesn't seem like this is a facility where people are going to be able to make a living wage and still reside in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4960.834s">We</a>  have an industrially zoned property. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4963.174s">We're</a>  trying to change the use to a commercial use. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4965.535s">And</a>  we have, I mean, quite frankly, if you look at there, it's a large parcel of land. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4968.855s">We</a>  have coals on one end, marshals on the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4971.196s">We're</a>  putting in a supermarket. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4972.376s">Now</a>  we're going to put in a pet store. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4973.836s">I</a>  don't think there's any jobs in that entire facility other than the manager of the supermarket that's going to get paid more than minimum wage.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4982.393s">I</a>  think that we would disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4983.914s">Wegmans,</a>  the supermarket operator themselves, stands out as one of the more outstanding employers across the supermarket industry, certainly in terms of wages and benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=4999.758s">The</a>  retail jobs within the center are at least consistent with the retail jobs that have been there historically. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5010.64s">All</a>  of these companies do provide benefits, and we think that they are consistent with what's been there in the past.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5018.167s">So</a>  this employer does provide health benefits to its full-time workers?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5022.21s">Yes,</a>  to both, I believe, yes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5034.281s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5040.313s">Can</a>  you just explain a little bit more in detail? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5042.854s">You</a>  said no overnight boarding of dogs and cats. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5045.877s">So</a>  does that mean there will be no sale of dogs and cats as well?</p>

    <p>[Brian Dugdale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5051.46s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5052.321s">Petco</a>  has an adoption first store, so there will be no sales of dogs or cats whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5057.605s">And</a>  there will be no adoptions through actually located at the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5061.908s">Typically</a>  what Petco does is they partner with local shelters to try to work <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5065.795s">to</a>  try to bring potential pets that could be adopted to potential pet owners, make that connection, but there will be no sales whatsoever at this store in terms of dogs and cats.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5075.537s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5075.877s">We</a>  have an organization in Medford that works for pet adoption, so hopefully we can connect the two.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5089.439s">Just</a>  briefly, some of the other services that Petco will offer <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5093.471s">They</a>  will offer grooming services, vet services, vet services that provide vaccinations, flea and tick screening, and those types of services that are on an appointment basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5105.656s">But</a>  again, as Brian indicated, there's no boarding that's made in connection with those veterinary services.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5118.081s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5118.801s">A</a>  quick question about the grooming services and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5122.713s">Are</a>  those going to be during the same business hours nine to nine or is grooming stop at a certain time or I'm fairly certain that they occur throughout the entire operating hours.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5134.599s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5135.92s">The</a>  vet services I do know do not vet services are a little bit shorter than their normal retail operating hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5143.864s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5148.146s">Madam</a>  Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5148.927s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5149.127s">Thank</a>  you for the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5149.947s">I'm</a>  just. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5152.032s">where</a>  the Petco and Woburn, they don't sell dogs or cats, but they do board them overnight, almost like a daycare. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5160.119s">Will</a>  there be any type of daycare in this Petco, day or night?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5164.343s">They</a>  will not. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5165.124s">So</a>  no daycare whatsoever? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5166.405s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5166.946s">They</a>  will offer training services, but there will be no overnight boarding.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5173.792s">And</a>  no daytime daycare?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5175.093s">I'm</a>  sorry, and no daytime.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5178.725s">So</a>  it'll just be grooming of dogs and cats, dogs, I'm assuming, and the sale of, what's the largest animal you'll be selling? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5187.193s">A</a>  guinea pig at times?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5189.134s">Guinea</a>  pigs, they don't even get quite to rabbits. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5191.837s">There</a>  are rules within Massachusetts that actually limit the size. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5197.542s">It's</a>  really classified as a beginner or an intermediate pet. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5200.865s">Birds,</a>  fish, small reptiles. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5204.797s">Are</a>  you with the mall developer? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5206.958s">I'm</a>  with New England Development, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5208.098s">We're</a>  the owner and the redeveloper. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5209.238s">What</a>  is the construction they're going to end with? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5212.259s">There's</a>  another big retailer going in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5214.68s">So</a>  the lineup starting on the Coles end would be Coles, Wegmans, Dick's Sporting Goods, the Petco store, and then on the far left, the existing Marshalls. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5225.003s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5226.304s">We're</a>  hoping for a fall of 17 open. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5228.064s">Madam?</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5230.877s">you</a>  here tonight, can you say that again?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5234.12s">Fall</a>  2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5234.841s">Fall</a>  of 17.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_30]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5237.924s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5238.384s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5240.766s">I</a>  know there were some citizens that wanted to speak on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5243.309s">You're</a>  welcome to come up and state your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5251.476s">My</a>  name is Marie Mazzio, 6 Cudworth Street, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5256.189s">And</a>  I'm here making sure that what we don't want to see is cats and dogs being sold in a pet store. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5264.693s">We</a>  definitely don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5267.014s">I</a>  know that in the city of Medford with grants that we have gotten in working with Pat Hogan, that Medford really has come up a long way on <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5278.735s">spaying</a>  and neutering and we've really have brought down the number of cats that we have gotten telephone calls in the past of stray kittens and abandoned animals. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5292.799s">They're</a>  still out there but we certainly, there are too many animals being put down every day and we don't want to see people breeding like <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5302.623s">puppy</a>  mills just to sell dogs and encouraging people to have their cats reproduced so that they can make $10 or whatever selling pets to a pet store. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5314.613s">So</a>  we are familiar with Petco, Kitty Connection, the organization that I founded does network with Petco and WUBEN and as long as there's no dogs, cats, or animals being exploited for sale, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5330.926s">Um,</a>  I don't see there being any, any problem with the pet go. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5336.49s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5834.36s">Uh,</a>  Mr. President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5836.061s">Uh,</a>  this paper came up last week and it was tabled, um, at the request of council Scarpelli and myself, um, based upon the historic, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5845.527s">negligence</a>  that National Grid and their contractors has given to our public roadways, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5851.289s">Ultimately,</a>  there was a permit that was before us, and I picked up the phone and spoke with National Grid last week, and I explained to them the reasoning for my vote and the reasoning for not supporting the permit, at which time the individuals from National Grid explained to me that what they were doing was pulling a permit for the developer, and the developer was going to be performing the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5874.057s">They</a>  put me in touch with the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5876.125s">I</a>  had an opportunity to speak with the developer and Mr. Shea is here this evening as well as his project manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5882.53s">And</a>  they explained to me that this proposal came forward as part of a redevelopment proposal with the location at 630 Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5893.873s">This</a>  is a project that's gone through the variance process at the Zoning Board of Appeals and is a move from a taxi cab stand to some residential rental units here in the community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5907.161s">Earlier</a>  in the year, it's my understanding that public utility came in and replaced all the underground utilities for water sewer from the roadway in Somerville, which would be called Broadway, along Boston Ave, Medford Stretch to Harvard. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5923.919s">So</a>  that whole entire underground utility has been replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5927.2s">And</a>  it's also my understanding, Mr. President, that come the spring, that entire stretch of the roadway is going to be repaved from curb to curb for the entire length. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5936.064s">So</a>  it's very important that we take a look at this permit and allow these individuals to go and do the work that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5944.407s">Because</a>  if we do not, and they come back at a later date, Mr. President, we will have a road that was just recently paved, brand new curb to curb from the Somerville line to Harvard Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5953.692s">that</a>  is now going to need to be cut up and dug up and patched. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5959.117s">And,</a>  um, I think that, um, I'm very glad that I had the opportunity to speak with, um, Mr. Shea and, um, Mr. Klein, the two people that are working on this development here, as well as the gentlemen that appeared before us last week to clarify some of the questions that I have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5973.168s">But,</a>  um, it's my understanding that Commonwealth contracting will be resurfacing Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5977.812s">Um,</a>  they're looking to start that work in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5980.697s">And,</a>  um, my questions and concerns relative to whether or not the public contractor is going to be accountable have been answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5986.919s">Um,</a>  the developers have agreed to stay in contact with me and provide me with a monthly update, um, a look ahead as to what's going to happen down there in a monthly update, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=5995.303s">So,</a>  um, with that being said, I'd move to take the matter off the table and move for approval based upon the fact that, um, the concerns and questions that I raised that held the paper up have been addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6004.666s">Um,</a>  I can't speak for my colleague, councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6009.188s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6010.26s">On</a>  the motion for approval, chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6014.623s">I,</a>  uh, to be redundant, I won't bore everybody with such an eloquent statement from my colleague, but, uh, I too talked to Mr. Shea, Mr. Klein. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6023.308s">I</a>  think that, uh, uh, talking to, to national grid, um, uh, the message has been sent and, um, my, my, my, uh, address to them is that this will, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6036.163s">at</a>  least with this councilor, every time project comes forth, um, I will, um, table it until, um, we see some action and what they've done and past and past work and make sure that we have their commitment moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6052.09s">So</a>  I too support, uh, moving this forward and, uh, uh, wishing Mr. Shea, uh, good luck.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6060.293s">Good</a>  luck, Mr. Shea on the motion for removal by council and I seconded by councilor, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6065.586s">uh,</a>  Scarpelli chair recognizes council night again.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6068.147s">Um,</a>  I also, Mr. President, I think it's very important to point out that the reason for the, um, tabling of the matter wasn't because of opposition to the development, but more or less it was opposition to the work and national grids doing in our community and the followup that we're doing on the city side to make sure that they comply with city standards and restore our streets to the condition that they deserve to be restored. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6090.155s">And</a>  so, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6090.697s">I</a>  mean, it had nothing to do with the project or the scope thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6093.159s">Mr.</a>  President, it was more or less the relationship between our public contractors in the city here and what we need to do to have them do a better job. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6100.623s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6101.024s">Councilor</a>  Marks is now recognized.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6103.605s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6105.687s">During</a>  that meeting, I also believe we asked for a list for the last three years of all street openings and any permits that have been pulled. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6116.073s">And</a>  also to see what the follow up was from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6120.822s">And</a>  I think what we're going to find, Mr. President, is a lack of oversight on behalf of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6126.625s">So</a>  I don't fault the different contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6131.647s">I</a>  don't fault the different utility companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6135.309s">I</a>  fault the city, because the city is there to safeguard us as a community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6140.892s">And</a>  they are the ones that should be held their feet to the fire to make sure that when these utility companies do come into the community, that they put back <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6150.029s">uh,</a>  the road in the same condition or better condition than they found it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6155.211s">And</a>  that sign off and check and balance is not currently taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6158.932s">So</a>  I asked Mr. President once again that we received the report that this council voted unanimously on for, I believe it was the last three years of a street opening permits and any follow up by this city on those permits.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6173.736s">Mr.</a>  President, now that this paper is on, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6176.654s">off</a>  the table and coming towards some action. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6182.955s">Once</a>  that action is taken, the amendments will be sent out to the appropriate people, and I'm sure we will quickly receive our responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6191.797s">So</a>  on the motion approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6195.457s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6196.297s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6196.938s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6197.738s">Guys</a>  have it, congratulations, the motion is passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6203.879s">Do</a>  we have a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6207.364s">The</a>  motion to return to regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6209.506s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6210.246s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6211.607s">Motion</a>  granted 16-799 offered by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6216.031s">Be</a>  it resolved that the City Administration share any information they might have with the City Council in regards to the Langwood Commons development site. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6226.538s">Whereas</a>  the development being discussed in this location will result in negative quality of life issues for the residents of Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6234.182s">but</a>  more so for the residents in North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6237.044s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Scott Peli and Councilor, where is this being offered for development?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6244.19s">It's</a>  the hospital site. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6246.331s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6246.832s">And</a>  I think that with our ad hoc committee, that's been working very hard with trying to figure out the Malden site and what's happening there and thanking our traffic supervisors, the police department and Sergeant Hottnett and Brooks that <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6263.35s">um,</a>  doing performing that study and now finding that, um, it looks like that development at Lang Langwood has now passed its final hurdle with, uh, the fells, um, petitions that now they're going to start, uh, uh, moving forward with their development. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6282.154s">So</a>  with what's going on, what's going on in that area and the fear and, uh, what's going to happen, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6289.238s">with</a>  traffic and congestion is, is, um, something we need to make sure that we act, um, a more aggressive manner with our city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6299.828s">So</a>  I'd ask the mayor to, um, to, to reach out if we can, uh, have the mayor reach out to, um, uh, every, every and any department we need to, to see where we stand with this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6313.455s">and</a>  what effects it's going to have, uh, in our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6317.818s">Um,</a>  it's, it's just when we talk about the Malden site, the Malden hospital site, it takes you back. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6324.703s">And,</a>  um, now with this piling on it, uh, the development that's being proposed in those areas are frightening to our quality of life and Medford and especially, like I said, um, North Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6340.074s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6341.362s">Thank</a>  you on that motion chair recognizes Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6344.163s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6345.363s">Also</a>  thank you to Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6348.704s">Um,</a>  this is definitely a quality of life issue that is going to impact North Medford and Fulton Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6355.825s">Uh,</a>  like a Councilor Scarpelli said him, uh, Councilor Longo and myself have been working diligently on the, uh, Malvern hospital ad hoc subcommittee on, uh, the issues, uh, surrounding the Malvern hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6367.687s">This</a>  is very similar in nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6369.368s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6370.657s">It's</a>  an impact on quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6371.798s">The</a>  traffic is going to be out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6375.28s">We're</a>  already talking about hundreds of additional trips from Malden Hospital, potentially, and you're talking about, I mean, many, many more than that, I believe, up at the old New England Memorial site in Stoneham. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6387.767s">So</a>  this is a major concern, a major quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6393.31s">So</a>  far, with regard to the research that we've done in the Malden Hospital, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6398.899s">had</a>  Sergeant Hartnett and Officer Brooks go out and do traffic counts on Murray Hill Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6403.82s">We'll</a>  be getting that report soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6406.201s">So</a>  what I'd like to do is if Councilor Scarpelli wouldn't mind, I'd like to amend the resolution that we get traffic counts on Highland Avenue, Elm Street, and on Fulton Street in the interest of public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6419.064s">We</a>  need to be proactive with regard to this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6423.365s">Like</a>  Councilor Scarpelli said, this is a major quality of life issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6427.691s">We</a>  need to be out in front of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6429.531s">And</a>  in talking to Sergeant Hartnett, we cannot get traffic counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6434.353s">We're</a>  not gonna be able to get them soon because of the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6437.053s">I</a>  guess the traffic counting machine doesn't work well in inclement weather and in the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6440.954s">So</a>  probably in the spring, we will be able to get those counts. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6444.695s">But</a>  I'd like to amend the resolution that we get traffic counts on Highland Ave, Elm Street and Fulton Street in the interest of public safety.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6452.817s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6453.537s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Falco, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6457.442s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6460.223s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6460.983s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd also like to ask that we bring in the DCR into this because the DCR is, uh, I was involved in this project a couple of years ago and I know there's going to be a lot of roadway changes up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6474.225s">Uh,</a>  so we can see what roadway changes are going to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6477.826s">Uh,</a>  especially I've heard talk of the rotary being taken out, uh, and the, and widening of some of the, that, that historic roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6486.002s">Uh,</a>  so if we could, uh, maybe get them in to give us a report, uh, on what's going to be happening with the roadway and with all that parkland up there, uh, and the impact that's going to have on that.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6497.768s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6498.568s">So</a>  on the motion of council Scarpelli, as amended by council Falco and council caveo chair recognizes councilor night.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6505.131s">Um,</a>  Mr. President, I'd like to further amend the paper and request that we reach out to the friends of the fells as well and ask if they can provide us with any data that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6512.134s">I</a>  know the friends of the fells were, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6514.272s">spearheading</a>  the effort to combat the development there at this location, um, because of the impact that it would have on the ecosystem. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6520.697s">So</a>  I think that they may have a lot of that traffic data and stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6523.439s">It</a>  might be a little bit outdated, but it might be a spot for us to start off with.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6527.201s">And</a>  further amended by Councilor Knight on that motion as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6532.065s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6536.508s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6537.329s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for offering this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6540.05s">Uh,</a>  this is a major, major issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6542.807s">uh,</a>  for the North Medford Heights area. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6545.029s">And</a>  in addition to, uh, which I think is a worthy, uh, additional study, uh, for the traffic volume. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6550.992s">Uh,</a>  I would also like to see Mr. President, uh, a study be done by DCR regarding a pedestrian crossing and pedestrian safety, uh, along Fulton street and along Elm, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6562.8s">Uh,</a>  I just read somewhere, uh, online that the city of Malden sat at the table with DCR and they're in the process of doing <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6571.595s">hundreds</a>  of thousands of dollars in renovation to a rotary in Malden, with the likelihood of DCR picking up the entire tab. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6581.237s">And</a>  it surrounds vehicular safety as well as pedestrian safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6586.018s">So</a>  I don't think it's a lot to ask, Mr. President, that we ask for these particular reports and also get feedback from DCR on the potential to additional traffic, which we already know Elm Street <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6601.074s">is</a>  a major cut through into the city of Medford and our neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6611.057s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilors Falco, Caraviello, Knight, and Marx. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6618.319s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6619.699s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6619.859s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6621.42s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6622.18s">The</a>  motion passes 16-800. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6627.581s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6630.407s">that</a>  the city arborist send the city council report on what type of trees are being planted on city property. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6638.49s">Whereas</a>  the trees that have been previously planted are beginning to raise newer sidewalks causing dangerous surfaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6647.113s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6648.973s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6650.054s">Again,</a>  I received a few phone calls both from, uh, uh, neighbors, um, on, uh, not only just, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6658.007s">in</a>  my, my neighborhood in North Medford, North Medford, but also in, uh, other, uh, neighborhoods that, uh, had their streets and sidewalks done over the last 10 to 15 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6670.771s">And</a>  what they're, what we're seeing is the type of trees that were planted at the time, um, were at the time, uh, those residents that accepted those trees and were told that there, they weren't going to be the same type of rooting trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6686.047s">that</a>  as the trees grow, the roots then raise the sidewalks and, uh, traverse into homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6692.431s">Unfortunately,</a>  we're seeing that that's not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6695.412s">And,</a>  uh, relatively newer streets and sidewalks and our residential areas are now popping up and causing a very dangerous, uh, and hazardous situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6706.298s">So</a>  there's nothing we can do about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6709.24s">But</a>  as we move forward, um, I'm hoping we can make, uh, make the motion that, uh, we, we, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6715.672s">meet</a>  with the city arborist to make sure that as they're preparing to purchase their new trees in the spring and what they'll be proposing for new construction road work that we're using the proper trees that will not affect the sidewalks and the roads in such a negative manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6734.944s">We'll</a>  also be talking about this process again in the next 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6740.848s">I</a>  also, if we can, as I was traveling talking to different <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6745.84s">uh,</a>  constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6746.72s">One</a>  of the questions came about is where we also stand. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6749.981s">Um,</a>  we can amend that is where we stand as tree city USA. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6754.201s">And</a>  as we're losing trees, how we're replacing them and, uh, throughout our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6758.962s">So</a>  thank you for the opportunity this evening.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6762.023s">Uh,</a>  the motion of council Scarpelli as amended to, uh, uh, figure out where we stand to make ourselves a tree city USA again. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6772.385s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6773.185s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6773.385s">Recognize</a>  this council Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6775.144s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6776.504s">Once</a>  again, I thank council Scarpelli for bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6780.145s">It's</a>  an important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6781.285s">Um,</a>  but I'd like to also, uh, if we could amend the resolution further, I know during the past year we've talked a lot as a, uh, as a committee about stumps, trees and, uh, sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6794.167s">And</a>  if we could get a report back from, uh, the DPW with regard to how many sidewalks have been replaced this year, how many trees have been planted, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6802.977s">and</a>  how many stumps had been removed.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6804.878s">So</a>  in the calendar year of 2016? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6807.18s">You</a>  are correct, year to date, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6809.261s">Year</a>  to date report as amended by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6815.046s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6819.289s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6820.089s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6820.93s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6823.471s">Carried</a>  16-805. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6826.514s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6829.336s">Whereas</a>  Massachusetts Municipal Association <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6833.079s">has</a>  established a fiscal policy committee to establish a series of best practice recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6838.743s">And</a>  whereas adequate funding of municipal reserve accounts to mitigate budget risks from extraordinary and unforeseen events and maintain fiscal stability over time has been deemed a best practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6852.634s">And</a>  whereas it is widely recognized that those local governments who have established and funded reserve and stabilization accounts at sufficient levels <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6861.865s">have</a>  been well served because these reserves allow localities to sustain services in times of economic and fiscal distress and limit the risk from extraordinary and unforeseen occurrences. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6874.649s">And</a>  whereas sound policies and practices, along with adequate levels of reserves, can also have positive impact on credit ratings and reduce the cost of borrowing and capital project spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6888.072s">And</a>  whereas the DOI's Division of Local Services <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6891.27s">advises</a>  that a good reserve policy will establish target balances for the local stabilization fund and other reserves and will establish a schedule of annual appropriations designed to reach target balances gradually over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6905.478s">And</a>  whereas the government finance offices associations executive board recommends local governments establish a formal policy on the level of unrestricted fund balance that should be maintained in the general fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6919.033s">at</a>  a suggested level of no less than two months of general operating fund revenues or expenditures, and that various parts of the fund balance be specified, each of them, for the purpose of working capital, budget stabilization, and responding to extreme events. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6939.229s">Be</a>  it therefore resolved that the Medford City Council request the city's administration <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6944.043s">to</a>  establish a reserve stabilization account and policy for the use or drawing down off reserves and for the replenishment thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6955.093s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6956.354s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6958.376s">Um,</a>  last term, the city council, um, by way of resolution, uh, brought forward by Councilor Camuso voted to establish a stabilization account and, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6968.44s">At</a>  the time Governor Baker was just elected and there was some discussion about whether or not stabilization accounts were going to become a mandatory practice across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at the municipal level because it's been deemed the best practice, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6981.388s">So</a>  we here in the city of Medford do have a stabilization account, but after my conversations with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6986.711s">Nunley</a>  last week, it appears that there is no money in our stabilization account, nor is there a policy to take money out of a stabilization account or a policy to replenish our stabilization account. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=6998.48s">So</a>  I think that it's about time, Mr. President, that we ask the administration to take a look at establishing a stabilization account. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7004.965s">Now,</a>  the Government Finance Office's Association's Executive Board does recommend that a formal policy be established and that an unrestricted fund level be maintained that should be no less than two months of operating revenue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7017.855s">Now,</a>  if we take a look at the fiscal year's budget that we're in right now, we're looking at a $162 million budget, and two months of operating expenses thereof would be <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7027.645s">The</a>  equivalent of $13.66 million that right now would be deemed a best practice to be set aside into a reserve account, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7035.634s">So</a>  I'd like the administration to establish a policy as to what functions and purposes that these funds can be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7045.145s">to</a>  set a target as to how much funds are going to be appropriated annually, and then we can begin to establish a real rainy day fund or a real reserve account, Mr. President, so that we run into situations like the police station, it's a catastrophic event, we're in a better position to deal with it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7071.309s">I</a>  just have questions with regards to <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7075.461s">how</a>  we're going to fund 13.66 million a million. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7077.843s">I'm</a>  going to take some money out of free cash or are we going to, how, how are we going to, you know, do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7086.49s">Um,</a>  I have questions with regards to this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7090.773s">I</a>  don't feel comfortable voting for it tonight until maybe a prop. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7094.055s">We</a>  understood it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7096.637s">We</a>  have 10 million in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7097.938s">We</a>  have reserves in our water and sewer enterprise account. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7100.961s">We</a>  have reserves from rate payers for the cable franchise fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7105.458s">Now</a>  we want to establish another $13.66 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7108.9s">I</a>  just don't see how we're going to be able to do that unless we were going to take from, you know, whatever certified free cash we have at the end of the year and put it into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7119.465s">Is</a>  the recommendation to put a portion of that into the reserve fund so that in years down the road we can eventually create a point where we're comfortable? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7128.79s">Are</a>  we looking to, you know, continue to tax or Proposition 2.5? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7133.172s">What's</a>  the proposal?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7134.961s">So</a>  if Councilor Knight can respond to that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7138.082s">The</a>  proposal is to establish a policy to begin to fund our stabilization account as well as a policy to initiate withdrawals thereof and mandate replenishment thereof.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7153.987s">I</a>  think we would just need a meeting on it before we actually vote it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7157.188s">I</a>  mean, I'm not in agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7158.788s">I</a>  just can't see where the $13 million would come from and I</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7164.98s">It</a>  can be built up over time.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7165.92s">Kind</a>  of set guidelines ourself and say, Madam Mayor, this is what we're proposing rather than, I don't know if my council colleagues have any other questions.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7177.125s">We</a>  have a motion for approval, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7181.587s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7183.467s">Mr.</a>  President, if we could refer this to the Auditing, Finance and Budget Taxation Subcommittee, maybe discuss this before we vote on it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7192.699s">Maybe</a>  everyone else will feel a little more comfortable knowing where we're going to get the $13 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7197.104s">I</a>  think that's a pretty <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7206.36s">a</a>  large sum of money to come up with out of, you know- Point of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7210.582s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor, and I- $13.6 million is based upon the recommendation that's made by the government finance offices associations executive board that recommends that the formal policy that's established should set aside two months worth of general operating funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7223.889s">It</a>  doesn't have to be the end all, be all. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7225.61s">That's</a>  just what the standard that's recommended by the professionals that are in the industry, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7229.91s">Um,</a>  I certainly have no problem with the paper going to subcommittee if the subcommittee is going to meet and vet it, but we just set the tax rate tonight and that subcommittee hasn't met since as long as I've been on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7238.175s">So,</a>  you know, although I have no problem with the paper going to subcommittee provided work is going to be done there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7242.858s">I</a>  think that this is something, Mr. President, we're asking the administration to put a policy in place because last council, we asked them to create an account. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7249.181s">They</a>  created an account. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7250.482s">The</a>  account has zero dollars and zero cents in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7252.924s">So</a>  if we're asking them to create a stabilization account, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7255.68s">for</a>  the purpose of providing us with reserves in the municipal bank account so that we can deal with catastrophic events, but don't put any money in it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7263.043s">I</a>  don't, I don't think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7264.364s">So</a>  I have no problem sending the paper to the audit and finance and taxation subcommittee, provided that it meets council coffee.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7271.567s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7272.287s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7273.828s">I</a>  think when we, we would, when we talked with the consultant last week when he was here, he said that, you know, we were the money that we had, he thought was, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7283.476s">not</a>  great, but compared to other cities, we were in fairly decent shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7289.14s">To</a>  take that and to single it out for one particular purpose right now without any discussion, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7298.258s">It</a>  wouldn't be prudent enough, so let's say- Point of clarification, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7301.639s">Either</a>  through a council- Point of clarification, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7304.86s">I'm</a>  not looking for $13.6 million to get transferred from one account to the other tomorrow by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7309.881s">I'm</a>  asking for the mayor to develop a policy and a procedure so that we can define the level of funding that we want. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7316.302s">It</a>  could be one month, it could be a half a year, it could be two months, it could be two bucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7320.063s">But</a>  we have to have some sort of policy in place if we're gonna have a stabilization fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7323.444s">We</a>  have a stabilization fund, we have no policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7325.544s">Motion</a>  for approval on the floor.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7329.522s">Council</a>  Caraviello would like you to go to a council of the whole or to the subcommittee for a little discussion before we vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7338.586s">We</a>  have a motion for approval first.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7341.087s">So</a>  do we take that as a deep breaker? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7343.408s">Chair</a>  recognizes councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7346.009s">I</a>  think it's a good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7347.009s">I</a>  think it makes fiscal sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7349.25s">I</a>  think it, I think it's a good resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7351.431s">I</a>  think it makes good fiscal sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7353.832s">And</a>  I have, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7355.577s">I</a>  have no problem with it going to subcommittee, but I think it would be nice to actually get a draft policy first that would come to subcommittee and then we can discuss it because then we'll have something to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7366.827s">So</a>  I'd like to, I'd like to see a draft, you know, Paul, I think if we pass this, have it, or maybe it's amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7372.692s">So</a>  it's a draft policy that comes to us with a plan and then we can meet in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7378.477s">And</a>  I mean, I've, uh, you know, I've only been on the board for years, years. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7382.06s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7382.934s">I'm</a>  on this subcommittee and, you know, I'd be more than happy to take a look at it with my, I believe Councilor Caraviello and Councilor Marks around this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7393.764s">Myself,</a>  other thing is Councilor Falco, Councilor Marks, myself, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7400.009s">That's</a>  it, so it's the three of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7401.13s">Councilor</a>  Marks was on here twice.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7403.893s">He's</a>  got two votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7404.874s">He's</a>  got two votes.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7407.116s">So,</a>  I think it, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7410.382s">So</a>  Mr. President, I think it makes sense to actually move this to subcommittee, but I think it would make more sense to have a draft policy come to us with the administration, how they would like to handle it, and what they would like the policy to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7424.327s">We</a>  can review it and vet it, and at that point make a decision, OK, do we want changes to this? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7428.969s">Does</a>  this make sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7430.45s">Or</a>  is it something we can live with? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7432.21s">Or</a>  maybe it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7434.051s">But</a>  I think that we need to have something to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7437.772s">We</a>  need to get something from the administration first.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7444.599s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7446.6s">Uh,</a>  it's, it's not, uh, under the purview of this council to create policy that's done by, uh, the executive branch. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7456.126s">And</a>  if the mayor chooses to create a policy around that, which I agree with council on that, I think it's a great suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7462.968s">and</a>  I think it should be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7464.289s">I</a>  prefer, I'd rather send the paper to the mayor asking whether the mayor thinks this is a good idea, whether this would be a policy she would need to create. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7475.235s">Maybe</a>  the mayor, I mean the mayor's a CPA, maybe the mayor in her wisdom doesn't see a need for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7480.597s">So</a>  I don't see why we as a council should spin our wheels on something that's an administrative function. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7487.041s">And</a>  if the mayor sees fit, the mayor sends us notes all the time, I support. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7491.626s">This</a>  resolution, I support that resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7494.008s">I</a>  didn't see it with this one, but, uh, you know, maybe we should ask the mayor if she's in support and would you like creating a policy, madam mayor, rather than, you know, a legislative body that doesn't create policy, uh, dictate Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7507.581s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense to me, but I, but I think it's a worthy idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7512.225s">I</a>  think having a policy is a worthy idea.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7516.309s">And</a>  thank you all Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7518.261s">So</a>  I can straighten out this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7521.663s">We</a>  have a motion for approval and we have a motion for it to go to committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7527.788s">And</a>  a motion to send to the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7530.43s">So</a>  you're going to change your motion?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7535.493s">You</a>  withdraw your motion.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7547.972s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7557.817s">Which</a>  was Councilor Falco's that the paper be sent to the mayor for rumination and opinion on that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7567.161s">All</a>  those in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7568.902s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7570.563s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7576.018s">Councilor</a>  Marks, what did you say? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7587.261s">I</a>  assumed that they were both the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7588.981s">My</a>  apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7590.061s">So</a>  that was the motion of Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7591.642s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, let the record show it and stand corrected.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7594.182s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7600.882s">16-802</a>  petition by councillor Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street, Medford Mass, to address the council on police staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7610.61s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7610.83s">Martin,</a>  you know you've addressed that to us on within 90 days.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7618.118s">What's</a>  that now? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7619.359s">Oh,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7620.839s">First</a>  of all, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7622.52s">Jean</a>  Martin, 10 Cumming Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7624.401s">Police</a>  staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7625.782s">I</a>  have a solution that will both satisfy police staffing shortages and black equity. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7630.804s">However,</a>  this policy needs to be carried out to the letter of my recommendation or it will fail as an integration tool. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7637.667s">My</a>  point is not to diminish other racial groups, but the slightest dilution waters down the real intent behind this initiative and the black man will once again be left behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7647.572s">We</a>  currently have 107 police officers and we need 130. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7650.913s">I</a>  propose we develop a policy whereby 10% of the police department constitute black men. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7657.494s">Of</a>  the 10% black males hired, at least 7% of them must be veterans of military service. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7665.395s">If</a>  we require a supermajority of the 10% to be black veterans, there will be less resistance from the veterans groups who also have a valid complaint. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7673.877s">Since</a>  the goal is 130, then 13 will be black men, and of that, nine must be black male veterans. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7681.912s">leaving</a>  the general population to account for the other four black men. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7685.975s">I</a>  will discuss women in a minute, but there can be absolutely no substitution, not even a two-for-one black woman veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7694.881s">Black</a>  men are a unique subset of society, and if our goal is to obtain racial justice for the black men, then no substitution can water it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7704.068s">Black</a>  men need role models on the street through the police department, and I dare say that white people also need to see black men in blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7712.095s">This</a>  is a hard reality, but needs to be said. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7716.217s">There's</a>  a difference between the atrocities we have committed on black males and the general discrimination other races have gone through. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7723.542s">The</a>  first requires active steps by our government to correct a past harm, and the latter only equal treatment, not corrective action. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7731.066s">Awareness,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7732.767s">Extra</a>  steps, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7735.959s">This</a>  distinction must be understood and accepted by all of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7739.601s">Otherwise</a>  this plan to integrate the city will fail. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7742.963s">Yes</a>  even Hispanics cannot be accepted as a black minority unless of course he or she is black is he is a black Hispanic not because he is Hispanic but because he is black. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7754.028s">If</a>  we include Hispanics we start to go down the rabbit hole. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7757.85s">The</a>  policy will fail to address the number one racial objective. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7761.838s">So</a>  what if you're a Hispanic veteran? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7764.241s">You</a>  are placed under the general population outside of the black category, and I will personally advocate that you succeed over a non-veteran white nation.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7779.24s">police</a>  officers are selected through the civil service hiring process.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7782.801s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7783.662s">But</a>  I do have a right to have my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7785.722s">Please</a>  continue citizen.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7786.923s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7787.583s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7791.224s">So</a>  anyway, I will personally advocate that you succeed over a non-veteran white man or the general population because you are a veteran. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7798.727s">The</a>  math so far is 107 plus 13 equals 120 officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7803.888s">Now,</a>  for the other 10 officers, I would like to see women hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7807.109s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7807.829s">Because</a>  women bring something different to the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7810.609s">They</a>  should be trained exactly as their male counterparts, but they are not men. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7815.43s">We</a>  need women officers for the obvious, domestic violence, rape, and to transport women detainees to higher level prisons as women do commit crime. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7824.692s">One</a>  black woman and one white woman <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7826.679s">should</a>  be assigned to a racial task force for issues regarding profiling, example, that of an Arab-looking person who may be being harassed right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7836.272s">They</a>  can also be used as detectives in cybercrime and other investigative and intelligence roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7842.46s">Women</a>  have a soothing effect <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7846.287s">on</a>  overjacked male testosterone. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7848.349s">And</a>  this can help in many ways on the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7851.051s">But</a>  like black men, there has to be enough of them to make a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7854.715s">Tokens</a>  do not give us the same result. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7857.177s">So</a>  I would recommend no less than 15% and no more than 20% female. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7861.861s">I</a>  do not want to emasculate the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7864.664s">Men</a>  are the majority of offenders and require equal response. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7873.092s">Women</a>  veterans should be encouraged, but not mandated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7876.353s">Now</a>  for the mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7877.634s">At</a>  least four black women must be hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7880.015s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7880.735s">Because</a>  black women are black. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7882.796s">She</a>  is often treated more harshly by law enforcement because she is perceived to have attitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7887.477s">When</a>  I was 34, I was the first woman never kicked out of the JPVA women's clinic, and they wanted to prosecute me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7895.06s">The</a>  police chief, who looked like he was in his 50s and a veteran, paternalized me and calmed me down. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7900.851s">And</a>  he and I worked out an agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7903.032s">And</a>  while I was not allowed to go back to the women's clinic and put on the terror watch list, I was not arrested. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7908.994s">I</a>  know a black woman in another VA who did the same thing that I did, but was arrested. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7914.856s">A</a>  double standard does exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7916.697s">And</a>  at least four black women are required for them to have a real voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7921.868s">This</a>  is a plan that, if not deviated from, will work. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7925.629s">My</a>  fear and warning is that should you start substituting just any black male for a black male veteran, the problems we see in society will not be alleviated. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7934.991s">If</a>  you say that we cannot do this, Gene, because it is discriminatory, I feel sorry for society. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7941.033s">Because</a>  the original intent on the anti-discrimination laws were designed to advance black men, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7947.774s">And</a>  everyone else has co-opted his justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7950.845s">Political</a>  correctness is then interfering with black justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7954.128s">If</a>  you really want to see racial justice for the black man, you will make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7959.252s">Even</a>  if it takes more money to seek out a black male veteran by casting a wider net the size of New England or the Eastern Seaboard, they are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7970.462s">And</a>  if this is against the law, which is what Mr. Knight's indicating, then the law needs to be changed because the group that needs the most protection <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7979.748s">is</a>  not protected under the current law. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=7982.731s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8021.234s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8023.035s">And</a>  because this is the Mayor's initiative, I want to speak on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8027.556s">If</a>  it was just a citizen, and I do understand that it was disposed of, but if it was just a citizen.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8033.557s">Point</a>  of clarification, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8035.805s">The</a>  conversations initiative is a group of 28 community organizations that got together and started this. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8041.149s">It</a>  didn't start across the hall in the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8043.411s">It</a>  didn't start at city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8044.452s">It</a>  started through the community, through grassroots effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8046.854s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8047.514s">Excuse</a>  me, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8048.495s">But</a>  the resolution was by the mayor, and that's the key here. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8052.998s">It's</a>  a measure that I have to speak on because it's a city document, and it's a city-sponsored document. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8060.764s">And</a>  I found out why. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8062.766s">Anyway,</a>  mayor's conversation initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8065.973s">I</a>  am not in any way trying to bash the mayor, but I figured out why her conversations initiative didn't sit right with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8072.058s">This</a>  initiative is an official city document, and therefore I have the right to speak on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8077.482s">It</a>  should be rescinded and rewritten. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8079.584s">The</a>  mayor's premise is wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8081.505s">The</a>  strength of our nation is not derived from our diversity, but from the strength of our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution, not from our racial and ethnic makeup. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8090.853s">How</a>  our diversity is held together <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8092.922s">is</a>  through the power we continue to give the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8095.063s">Constitution</a>  by upholding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8097.203s">The</a>  Constitution encompasses a form of government which allows for the dissent of the minority from the majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8103.064s">Because</a>  of this ability, the dissent from the majority, diversity of thought and ideas can hold, can add to our majority culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8112.667s">And</a>  yes, tolerance of differences and ethnic groups enrich our nation as a byproduct, not as a fundamental belief, as stated by the Mayor's Conversation Initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8123.874s">Our</a>  nation was not founded on the fundamental principles that all persons are entitled to equal protection under the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8129.539s">It</a>  was founded on heterosexual white male supremacy, who committed genocide on the original peoples because they happened to be in the way of the land the white man thought to be his rightful possession. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8139.827s">At</a>  first, our forefathers tried to enslave the Native Americans, but their spirits died under bondage, and so it was not profitable. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8147.352s">and</a>  there was indentured servitude of white peoples as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8150.234s">But</a>  they were often given their freedom after seven years of service, usually their most prime years of good health. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8156.439s">Do</a>  I need to then state the obvious for Africans? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8162.204s">Once</a>  the colonists who were white males of the landowning class were themselves placed in the one down position by the royal class of England. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8169.35s">Taxation</a>  without representation, they revolted and earned their freedom while still subjugating other peoples of race and gender. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8176.811s">Equal</a>  protection of the law was not earned or given to others until much later and was not codified in its founding documents. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8184.178s">The</a>  opposite is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8185.579s">Slavery</a>  and native subjugation was codified. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8189.563s">What</a>  is true is that it was given to the following generations whose forebears earned it through their blood, often to the death, sweat, and tears of those two specific racial categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8199.773s">Because</a>  they learned how to apply our founding documents, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8202.809s">to</a>  their advantage, and the Native and Black peoples were still denied after that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8207.133s">It</a>  was not only the Bill of Rights which provided this justice to happen, but the actual process of putting forward resolutions to change the law provided for in the main body of the Constitution. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8219.884s">It</a>  is only through the continued application of the U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8222.987s">law</a>  that protection for these two primary groups see any semblance of justice. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8227.73s">You</a>  cannot start a conversation on race without including the Native peoples, and the Native peoples were not immigrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8234.435s">Leaving</a>  the Native American experience out of the base premise is intentional, and black people did not come here as immigrants groups until much later. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8243.301s">The</a>  main focus of this resolution, while admirable in some parts of its intent, is a form of subterfuge to include illegal immigrants. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8250.706s">And</a>  that is why the non-immigrant group, known as Native American, was intentionally left out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8257.065s">The</a>  problem with this premise is that it assumes all oppressions are equal and they are not. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8268.74s">I</a>  served under a possible five-year federal prison sentence in the Army for being a lesbian. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8274.778s">And</a>  I still knew better than to equate that with being black. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8278.38s">I</a>  used other rationales to change the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8280.641s">I</a>  argued that a gay man could be blackmailed and divulge military secrets. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8284.843s">I</a>  argued my own and countless other honorable discharges as proof that we have already served and with distinction. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8290.806s">I</a>  argued that it made straight women, as well as myself, more susceptible to rape. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8295.348s">And</a>  I argued that it cost the army money to train and kick me out. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8299.31s">But</a>  I never once used the black civil rights argument. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8302.651s">I</a>  knew better. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8304.132s">Not</a>  all oppressions are equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8305.813s">While</a>  they may overlap, they are not equal. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8308.455s">So</a>  I do believe we need to talk about race, yes, but not under this framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8313.979s">I</a>  agree that if you are an Arab-looking American today, we need to make sure you do not receive a backlash. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8319.703s">But</a>  this wording is not about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8321.804s">This</a>  wording is couched to include and protect illegal immigrants with legal immigrants, and that is not the same justice under the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8329.138s">If</a>  you want to talk about documenting illegals, say so openly. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8332.681s">We</a>  can talk, but not on the backs of Native and Black peoples. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8336.764s">Therefore,</a>  I believe this resolution, which is an official city government document, needs to be rescinded and rewritten to include the original peoples and African slavery as a prime example of inclusion as a result of how powerful our Constitution is, that it can fix its own structured abuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8354.66s">still</a>  questionable with Native Americans. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8357.948s">And</a>  then and only then, how other groups thrived off of their struggles. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8362.197s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8386.414s">Whereas</a>  that during the holiday season, residences tend to generate an increased amount of recyclables than usual, be it resolved that the city administration request that waste management increase recycling pickup <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8402.049s">to</a>  once per week, through the second week in January, be it further resolved that the city administration advertise the Christmas tree pickup schedule as soon as reasonably possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8413.797s">Councilor</a>  Knight?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8414.958s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8416.659s">I'm</a>  on trash day. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8418.107s">As</a>  you drive around the community, you'll see the blue-topped recycling bins all overflowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8424.611s">As</a>  the Christmas spirit comes into our homes and the holiday cheer permeates our residents and we begin to buy presents for our kids and our friends and our family, my house has turned into a bad episode of hoarders at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8438.8s">I</a>  have so many boxes in my house, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8441.762s">And</a>  I think that others in the neighborhood are feeling the same crunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8444.964s">So</a>  I'd ask that the administration <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8447.058s">reach</a>  out to waste management and see if there's any potential to increase the recyclable pickups to a weekly pickup between now and the week after the new year, Mr. President, so that those people that are battling the boxes and wrapping paper and so forth have an opportunity to get that stuff in the recycle bin. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8464.246s">And</a>  I also ask that when <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8466.613s">They</a>  are in their discussions with waste management that they begin to publicize the Christmas tree pickup schedule as soon as reasonably possible because, uh, every year at the end of the Christmas season, we usually have a street or two that puts the Christmas trees out a day or two after the Christmas tree pickup occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8482.798s">So,</a>  um, I think it would be good to get that word out there for everybody to, um, know what steps to take. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8489.303s">to</a>  get rid of some of the debris that they have, Mr. President, and when the Christmas tree pickup is going to happen.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8582.008s">Ho,</a>  ho, ho, ho, ho. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8583.449s">Council,</a>  please.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8585.29s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could, two weeks ago I brought up an issue with Aflac, which is a secondary insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8594.103s">that</a>  many city employees have in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8596.445s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8596.725s">And</a>  the fact that Aflac, uh, canceled employees policies due to, uh, nonpayment of, uh, the policy by on behalf of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8608.756s">And,</a>  um, I asked that, uh, five questions be sent to the administration on the impact it had on city employees for the nonpayment. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8620.638s">and</a>  a number of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8622.278s">And</a>  we received tonight on our desk, dated December 9th, from Anne Marie Irwin, the treasurer-collector, a letter stating more or less they didn't answer the five questions, but apparently it was a billing error that took place. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8638.125s">So</a>  for the past six or seven months, employees would cancel their AFLAC insurance because of a billing error, and they are going to <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8648.684s">create</a>  a policy now, this is the city, rather than send in monthly payments, they're going to send them in weekly to AFLAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8656.187s">So</a>  hopefully that won't happen in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8658.809s">But</a>  we still didn't receive a response, Mr. President, to the five questions that were asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8665.231s">And</a>  I think we still need a response from the administration.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8668.593s">I</a>  believe we received a letter, Councilor, on our desk this evening, and in the flurry of activity and votes we had, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8675.937s">I</a>  haven't had a chance to examine it, so I'm saddened to hear that it might be considered deficient.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8682.781s">It's</a>  extremely deficient, but, Mr. President, when this council votes on issues, whether you agree with the issue or not, we deserve a response from the administration, a thorough response, and not just a brush-off, Mr. President, saying there's a billing error. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8697.31s">So</a>  I'm very concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8699.651s">Also,</a>  Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8701.473s">Alex</a>  Ruperthal, someone that covered this community for the Medford Transcript as a reporter for the last, I think, maybe a year and a half, two years, three years? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8712.401s">Did</a>  tremendous work, Mr. President, on bringing up issues, enlightening the community on issues that confronted this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8723.508s">And</a>  he did Yeoman's work, he's moving back to <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8727.328s">the</a>  windy city of Chicago, and I wish him well on all his new endeavors. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8730.989s">He's</a>  a big Cubs fan, a great person, and we all wish him well, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8741.91s">The</a>  records of the meeting of December 6th, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8744.571s">Nicholas</a>  Day, 2016, were passed to Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8747.951s">Councilor,</a>  how did you find those? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8749.732s">I</a>  found these all in order and accept. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8753.272s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8757.473s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8758.315s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8760.058s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Falco, that the meeting be adjourned. <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8763.604s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8764.465s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8765.246s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/L7QFU4RDE4Q&t=8766.168s">Meeting</a>  is adjourned.</p>
