15
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:37,158
By order of the Medford City Council, Edward P. Finn, City Clerk, Medford Daily Mercury,

16
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:47,761
November 28th and November 5th, 2016 chair recognizes Ed O'Neill and Alicia Nunley.

17
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:58,863
Ed O'Neill, our assessor, Alicia, our, um, uh, finance director for the city of Medford, uh, to address us on the proceedings.

18
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:01,024
We've met twice in the past two weeks.

19
00:02:01,547 --> 00:02:08,129
in committee of the whole and report it out favorably to consider the four questions before us.

20
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,650
Thank you, Mr. President.

21
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:27,016
As chairman of the board of assessors, I am respectfully appearing before your honorable board body tonight for the purpose of holding a public hearing to discuss the following items concerning the allocation of the fiscal year 2017 property tax.

22
00:02:27,596 --> 00:02:30,617
Number one, to determine the residential factor to be used

23
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:31,762
for fiscal year 2017.

24
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:44,148
By selecting the minimum residential factor, percentage of the total tax levy will be shifted from the residential taxpayer to the commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

25
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:52,331
This results in a lower tax rate for residential properties and a higher tax rate for commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

26
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:56,233
Historically, the council has chosen the minimum residential factor.

27
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,174
If this is, once again, the council choice,

28
00:02:59,702 --> 00:03:05,686
The minimum residential factor is .903265.

29
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,228
Number two, to adopt an open space discount.

30
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,311
This does not apply in the city of Medford, but a no vote is required.

31
00:03:13,951 --> 00:03:16,293
Number three, adopt a residential exemption.

32
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:23,858
If adopted, owner-occupied residential properties may receive an exemption of up to 35% of the average residential value.

33
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:26,960
This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the tax levy

34
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:32,097
from the owner-occupied residential properties to non-owner-occupied properties.

35
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:40,583
Since this shift causes a higher residential tax rate, a number of owner-occupied properties would also see an increase in their tax bills.

36
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:44,186
Number four, to adopt a small commercial exemption.

37
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:55,093
If adopted, commercial properties housing a business employing 10 or less people and valued at less than $1 million may receive an exemption of up to 10% of their assessed value.

38
00:03:55,626 --> 00:04:04,471
This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the commercial industrial tax levy from these eligible properties to other commercial industrial properties.

39
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:13,097
Since this shift causes a higher commercial industrial tax rate, all commercial industrial not receiving the exemption would see an increase in their tax bills.

40
00:04:13,577 --> 00:04:19,380
As part of this hearing, it is the duty of the board of assessors to notify the council of any excess levy capacity.

41
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:21,122
Fiscal year 2017 excess levy capacity

42
00:04:24,246 --> 00:04:25,626
is $96,627.99.

43
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:48,831
For you, Mr. President, we'd like to go through the, uh, the handout that the council received, um, explaining the various, uh, parts of the tax classification hearing.

44
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:49,871
Um,

45
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:53,833
Refer to the table of contents.

46
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:59,194
We have the tax classification hearing and the residential factor on page one.

47
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:03,915
We have the tax levy limitations on page two.

48
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:10,056

49
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:14,357
Page four is a calculation of the lowest possible residential factor.

Page five is the what-if scenario at various residential factors.

51
00:05:20,575 --> 00:05:24,817
Number six is the LA-4, which is the evaluation by various classes.

52
00:05:26,837 --> 00:05:34,180
Number seven, the seven package evaluation summary or history percent of land use change, the average assessed value of surrounding communities.

53
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,401
Number eight is the LA-13 form, which is the new growth form.

54
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:41,863
Number nine is the tax dollar difference from fiscal 2016 to 2017.

55
00:05:41,923 --> 00:05:43,223
Page 10 is a recap sheet, which is four pages.

56
00:05:49,195 --> 00:05:51,416
Number 11 is a residential exemption law.

57
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:55,638
Number 12 is a residential exemption worksheet for review.

58
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:59,540
Page 13 is a residential exemption detail.

59
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:03,202
And lastly is the page 14 small commercial exemption.

60
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:09,285
To you, Mr. President, I'd like to open up some discussion on it.

61
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:10,786
Very good.

62
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:18,130
Just for the public's information,

63
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:36,583
the council met for over an hour last week and, uh, for 45 minutes, uh, this week with the, uh, assessor and a finance director and review and a consultant last week, the city's hired consultant on these matters, uh, to, uh, review these matters.

64
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:47,870
Uh, we did, uh, as we, uh, tend to do, um, uh, some significant research and analysis of figures regarding the resident, uh, exception,

65
00:06:48,815 --> 00:06:55,178
uh, exemption issue and, uh, looked at that in, in quite, uh, a bit of detail.

66
00:06:55,678 --> 00:07:04,042
So, uh, if you have anything more for us, uh, Mr. O'Neill, or if you'd, uh, like to have some questions from the counselors, otherwise the chair will, uh, await a motion.

67
00:07:16,805 --> 00:07:18,985
and also a reported out of the committee report.

68
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:30,587
Uh, the clerk just pointed out to me, uh, we're asking for a report to come to us, uh, to learn the total amount of tax dollars that are tax deferred.

69
00:07:31,468 --> 00:07:39,729
And those tax dollars are, um, uh, people who are eligible for tax deferment under certain circumstances pointed out in statute.

70
00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,710
And so that was part of our committee report and we're awaiting that report, uh, for the future, but it's not, uh,

71
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:48,889
conditioned upon our deliberations here.

72
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,329
Chair recognizes Vice President Lerner.

73
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:53,250
Thank you, President DelaRusso.

74
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,771
Mr. O'Neill, if maybe we could go over.

75
00:07:57,171 --> 00:08:08,194
I know the information we have is a great deal, but there were a couple of people that did call asking what the new rate was going to be and also, you know, what the increases were going to look like.

76
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:11,755
So maybe you're the best to go over page nine.

77
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,056
And I think that's the simplest way to put it.

78
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:14,956
People want to know

79
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:18,365
what, what will their property taxes go up and how much will that be?

80
00:08:18,385 --> 00:08:21,266
Um, so I think that's an important page.

81
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:22,567
That's very understandable.

82
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:23,347
Sure.

83
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:37,075
Uh, through you, Mr. President, uh, page nine is the, uh, if the, the council adopts the residential factor, uh, of 0.9 0 3 2 6 5, that would, um, with the existing levy of 105 million, 43,572 dollars and 1 cent.

84
00:08:44,337 --> 00:08:55,544
it would yield a residential rate of $10 and 56 cents and a commercial industrial personal property rate of $20 and 46 cents, both going down from last year.

85
00:08:56,524 --> 00:09:04,509
Um, so if he took the average single family, which is 475,910 per single family at the, at that, uh, proposed rate of 10 56, the average increase for a single would be two 79 93 cents.

86
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:04,709
Um,

87
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:25,068
The average condominium was $362,561 at the $10 rate would yield a $271.34 average tax increase.

88
00:09:25,128 --> 00:09:28,830
And that's average from last year's averages to this year's averages.

89
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:30,452
Some would be lower, some would be higher.

90
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:35,876
The two families, the average assessed value was 554,641 at the 1056 rate.

91
00:09:39,707 --> 00:09:42,789
would be, uh, two families would be $169 and 13 cents.

92
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:45,671
Uh, it's a little bit lower.

93
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:50,954
Um, I believe the two families increased last year, so the average was already a little bit higher.

94
00:09:51,654 --> 00:09:53,696
Um, so it's a little bit less of an increase this year.

95
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:58,038
The average three family at 600, 672,212 at the $10 56 tax rate would be an average increase of $401 and 34 cents.

96
00:09:58,058 --> 00:09:59,639
Again, that's average from last year to this year.

97
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:15,853
And the commercial industrial at $1,227,988 at $20.46, the average increase would be $426.58.

98
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:33,006
So what we've seen a little bit is the residential rate, residential appreciation factor as a class has gone up 10 to 12%, whereas the commercial industrials are about 7 or 8%, 9%.

99
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,632
So that's why it's less of an increase for the commercial industrial.

100
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,414
So those will be strictly averages.

101
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:50,280
So the, um, the reason for the drop in the rate is because of the assessments being higher this year.

102
00:10:50,300 --> 00:11:03,169
Um, cause the rate, the rate last year was 11 19 for residential and 21 82 for commercial, but because the assessments are higher, the rate has gone down.

103
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,156
But the properties will still see an increase in their taxes.

104
00:11:08,237 --> 00:11:10,078
And then the fiscal year 2016 levy was $4.2 million less.

105
00:11:10,118 --> 00:11:11,318
Last year's levy was $100,854,325.

106
00:11:29,344 --> 00:11:35,345
The levy has gone up with the 2.5% and the new growth for about 4.2, correct?

107
00:11:40,226 --> 00:11:57,090
And my next question, we had a long discussion last week and then we followed up this week with additional information you provided us, thank you, with regards to non-owner occupied properties and the potential vote we have with regards to the shift.

108
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:20,737
adopt a residential exemption, which in the past we've always voted against due to the fact that with the recalculation over 1,000 homes would also, if we made the shift to non-occupied, we'd also hit any home that is valued over 648,000, which totals about 1,050 pieces of property that would get hit extra.

109
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:46,169
I just think that's important for the public to know because we do get a lot of questions of why we don't do the shift compared to, I think you said Malden, the breakeven point was about 450, 500,000 and they only shifted to about a hundred parcels compared to Medford that would be over a thousand.

110
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:47,309
Is that correct?

111
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:56,376
Their impact on the high end, the breakeven was 480 and it was just over a hundred parcels that would be affected.

112
00:12:57,391 --> 00:13:08,317
where the break-even point is 650, 648 to 650, depending upon the percentage of the residential exemption adopted, which is maybe higher break-even point.

113
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:09,558
The number is higher.

114
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:10,578
It's 1,057 at 20%, 1,057 at 15%, 1,063 at 10%, 1,084 at 5%.

115
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:12,559
So what that means is anyone over the 648, 650,

116
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:33,906
is seeing an increase in value anyway, and potentially an increase even with the rate dropping.

117
00:13:34,987 --> 00:13:39,868
If this party approves a residential exemption, they would also see another bump up because the rate would change.

118
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:43,909
So they would get the residential exemption, but they would also pay more in taxes.

119
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:58,153
So, um, to summarize the residential exemption, the larger portion of properties below the breakeven point would receive a tax break at the expense of the higher value properties.

120
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,904
The non-owner occupied the apartment buildings.

121
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,510
So that's the decision by this body.

122
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:13,338
The tax policy decision, you want to treat the city as a whole or do you want to take care of a certain class of properties?

123
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:13,879
And that's where the.

124
00:14:15,023 --> 00:14:17,364
conflict is in voting this one way or another.

125
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:22,045
In other communities, they have different situations.

126
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:24,985
They might not have a high-end district, a high-end value.

127
00:14:30,647 --> 00:14:33,147
Their primary class might not be in Medford.

128
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,068
It's the single families, the primary class.

129
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:36,908
Other communities, it might not be the case.

130
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:39,629
Could be condominiums, could be two families.

131
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:41,229
So there's a number of factors.

132
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:44,830
That's why there's only a handful, 15 communities have adopted it so far.

133
00:14:45,438 --> 00:14:48,079
It's not a uniform percent for everybody.

134
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:50,019
So somebody pays the burden.

135
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,460
And you'll see that in the commercial, same thing.

136
00:14:52,520 --> 00:15:01,182
If you try to give a certain segment of the commercial properties a tax break, that burden gets shifted to the other parts of the commercial.

137
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:04,722
Industrial doesn't, it'll come into play in that.

138
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:07,163
So somebody has to pay the levy.

139
00:15:07,788 --> 00:15:11,069
And these are just options that you can shift burdens amongst them.

140
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:22,752
There's a, Dr. Starello used to say he'd like to have a single tax rate and everybody would pay the same thing and there'd be nobody, no special class benefiting one way or another.

141
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:30,053
But since classification, I believe in 1981, the city has voted to the maximum shift of 175.

142
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:36,755
And I agree, thank you, I agree with

143
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:44,829
the fact that we have to increase the levy and we have to, we need the levy obviously.

144
00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:57,655
But isn't it true we're going to increase it 4.2 million, but on average, especially the last four plus years, we've put 1 to 3 million into our free cash at the end of the year.

145
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:03,297
In essence, good to have some reserves, but we've built up our reserves.

146
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,678
We're at a free cash of almost 10 million.

147
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,371
We have Water and Sewer between $8 million and $10 million.

148
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:15,794
So at some point, will we be giving—I mean, I've questioned that the last two years.

149
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:22,637
I've put motions forward to reduce—to not tax to the max and possibly reduce the levy.

150
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:24,378
So is that correct?

151
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:28,620
We've put $1 million to $3 million into our free cash every year.

152
00:16:29,641 --> 00:16:31,161
I'll defer to Alicia on this.

153
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:34,783
Your Honorable President, through the chair.

154
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:37,809
Not every year, no.

155
00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:41,532
Within the last three years, yes, based on the analysis that I have given you.

156
00:16:42,413 --> 00:16:45,655
And when doing the free cash, it is one time.

157
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:48,918
It is not something that you will see every year.

158
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:55,963
So I think that the city is being fiscally prudent in the way that they are generating and keeping their free cash and using it as needed.

159
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:57,444
They're not just expending it.

160
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,151
In 2015, we put almost $2.5 million into free cash.

161
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:08,653
This year, we'll probably put in close to that.

162
00:17:08,673 --> 00:17:11,834
2014, looks like over, you know, $1.5 million.

163
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:21,158
Isn't there a point where we should say, okay, we'd really like to put a million in each year, but anything over that, we maybe should be giving the taxpayer a little break?

164
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:24,339
I think that the city is using it like reserves.

165
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:29,421
I know that one of the Councillors put forth a fiscal policy talking about stabilization.

166
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:35,061
So it's putting money aside, they're just keeping it inside free cash as reserves and used as necessary.

167
00:17:35,081 --> 00:17:42,125
I know the mayor has plans for some of that money, but she's very fiscally prudent, and as was the mayor before, in keeping reserves for the city.

168
00:17:45,046 --> 00:17:48,048
Is there a point where the mayor wants to keep the reserves too?

169
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:57,353
I think we've asked that question in the past, because one wants to build up her reserves, but there's also people that obviously can't afford their taxes.

170
00:17:58,232 --> 00:18:05,457
complain to us that they can't afford their taxes, senior citizens on fixed income that we probably would like to give a little break to if we can.

171
00:18:05,477 --> 00:18:10,261
And I think, and I questioned this the last two years, I think at this point we probably can.

172
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,363
Through the chair, I believe that's understandable.

173
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:24,090
And this is where I would have Ed step in is it's very, if we used $500,000, it's very minor in the impact.

174
00:18:24,611 --> 00:18:25,451
It's very minimal.

175
00:18:25,531 --> 00:18:27,873
Whereas to the city, depending on what kind

176
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,261
a project or if something happened unforeseen, they have those reserves ready.

177
00:18:32,301 --> 00:18:33,741
They don't need to go out and borrow.

178
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:44,304
For you, Mr. President, um, please take that a step further.

179
00:18:44,344 --> 00:18:51,326
I've done the analysis, uh, and distributed to the council and their package and Friday, the various scenarios.

180
00:18:51,526 --> 00:18:57,267
And, um, as Alicia stated, it would be the impact, um,

181
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:03,485
For every $500,000, it would be 5 cents on the residential tax rate.

182
00:19:03,745 --> 00:19:05,286
So every million, it would be 10 cents.

183
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:12,129
So $2 million decrease in the levy would be a 20 cent reduction in the tax rate.

184
00:19:12,229 --> 00:19:19,213
So it's a minimal impact versus having reserves set aside.

185
00:19:22,114 --> 00:19:23,555
And that was in your handout as well.

186
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:24,696
Thank you.

187
00:19:25,036 --> 00:19:25,296
Thank you.

188
00:19:25,356 --> 00:19:27,337
I requested those numbers.

189
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,302
Thank you for providing those to us.

190
00:19:30,342 --> 00:19:33,403
I think minimal to one person might not be minimal to the next.

191
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,884
$25 for a single family.

192
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:38,906
This is just a $500,000 decrease to the levy.

193
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:45,949
I mean, you're still talking about $125 for each commercial property that's seeing an increase of over $300.

194
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:52,552
It may be minimal to somebody, but there are businesses out there that are obviously struggling too.

195
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:57,594
So that, based on the fact we have in the

196
00:19:58,017 --> 00:20:01,239
tax recap, fiscal year 2017.

197
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:10,644
I mean, we are averaging our actual receipts for 2016 as the same for 2017, which we expect to come in for 2017.

198
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:14,125
So we don't account for any increase.

199
00:20:14,726 --> 00:20:23,330
And the biggest one, I guess, we've already discussed it at our Committee of the Whole meetings, is the new hotel that came on board in mid-2016.

200
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:27,072
So there's six months here that really isn't calculated for

201
00:20:28,163 --> 00:20:30,264
We have actual receipts in 2016 of $462,000.

202
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:36,927
And then we're placing our estimated receipts at $462,000 as well.

203
00:20:37,447 --> 00:20:42,550
And I believe, you know, meals tax goes up marginally every year, et cetera, et cetera.

204
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:46,332
So we base it on what we actually received.

205
00:20:47,032 --> 00:20:52,175
We didn't want to be too aggressive because if you go above what you receive, you have to justify that to DOR.

206
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:55,896
And then if we didn't reach that, we'd have a problem with DOR.

207
00:20:56,036 --> 00:20:57,097
So we have to match.

208
00:21:00,613 --> 00:21:10,399
Through the chair, may I also in addition on the free cash as well, I just want to point out that the mayor also does have plans to use that for a futurely proposed police station.

209
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,961
She wants to use free cash to fund that debt.

210
00:21:14,008 --> 00:21:18,591
Has she given you any paperwork for us to submit tonight with regards to a plan on that?

211
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:20,332
No, she just had a discussion.

212
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:20,832
Excuse me.

213
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:21,313
I apologize.

214
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,433
You don't have to say through the chair.

215
00:21:22,453 --> 00:21:24,655
I don't think to the chair.

216
00:21:25,695 --> 00:21:26,976
I have had a discussion with her.

217
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:29,057
She did tell me that she does have a plan for that.

218
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:35,081
I don't have paperwork with me, but she did tell me that is what she's planning to use some of the free cash for us to fund the debt.

219
00:21:36,726 --> 00:21:44,948
did, I mean, we, we've got the capital plan, but it didn't look like it was until 2018 and there's really no specifics given to the council.

220
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:50,389
So that might've been, you know, pertinent information before we made, took any type of vote tonight.

221
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:54,730
Um, cause I'd like to see a commitment of the, you know, the police station as well.

222
00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:04,312
I think this whole council would, um, and I haven't heard any specific dollar amount of it's, it's always been when she met with us, it was that we were going to go out to bond for the 18 million.

223
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:14,976
She told me her plan is for a proposed $20 million police station that she's going to use free cash to pay for that, that she's for the debt, for the debt proposed.

224
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:18,398
So she told you she's going to use the 20 million out of free cash.

225
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:19,799
No, no, no.

226
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:25,422
She said for the proposed police station that will cost around roughly $20 million.

227
00:22:26,443 --> 00:22:29,645
She's going to use free cash to fund some of that debt.

228
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:39,564
That's my questions for now, thank you.

229
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:42,127
Thank you, thank you.

230
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,511
Councilor Caraviello, the chair recognizes you.

231
00:22:46,852 --> 00:22:47,152
Thank you.

232
00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:51,176
Ed, Mr. O'Neill, do we have an open space tax rate?

233
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,999
No, we don't, we don't have any open space.

234
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:55,240
We have no open space in the whole city?

235
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,701
Classified open space, no.

236
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:57,682
Thank you.

237
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,439
Chair awaits a motion.

238
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:05,279
Counselor Knight.

239
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:13,864
Mr. President motion to adopt the minimum residential factor as proposed at a rate of 0.903265 on that motion.

240
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:16,945
Madam vice president.

241
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:29,211
I would just like to precede that motion and request that we reduce the tax levy by 500,000 based on the estimated receipts being, being low and the fact that we're putting millions into free cash.

242
00:23:30,012 --> 00:23:30,772
Um, and I was,

243
00:23:31,293 --> 00:23:35,054
We were, I believe I was told that the police station would be bonded after 2018-19.

244
00:23:35,434 --> 00:23:38,974
So I would just like to put that motion forward.

245
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:40,535
Is that SB paper?

246
00:23:40,635 --> 00:23:42,915
Whereas we have a paper here that's immutable.

247
00:23:44,615 --> 00:23:47,016
I looked at, that's the contradict.

248
00:23:47,076 --> 00:23:49,496
So that paper is always called first.

249
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:50,757
I've done it the last two years.

250
00:23:51,457 --> 00:23:56,298
So your motion is to reduce the levy by, so I have it correctly.

251
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:56,298
500,000. 500,000.

252
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:02,717
It's five zeros.

253
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:10,020
I think there's a citizen that wants to address us before the, uh, uh, vote takes place.

254
00:24:11,141 --> 00:24:14,882
Mr. Citizen, please step forward and state your name and address for the record.

255
00:24:15,563 --> 00:24:16,023
Welcome.

256
00:24:16,843 --> 00:24:17,804
Thank you.

257
00:24:18,144 --> 00:24:23,806
So, um, Andrew Castanetti, cushion street, Medford, Massachusetts.

258
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:30,389
You usually I'm very prepared with some sort of statement.

259
00:24:30,856 --> 00:24:36,742
It's the owner occupied real estate tax exemption because I'd like to see that happen here for the first time ever.

260
00:24:37,963 --> 00:24:48,993
However, due to family circumstances and I don't have, I'm not privy to all the paperwork on this year's proposal from the assessor's office.

261
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:51,736
So therefore I'm going to have to ad lib this.

262
00:24:52,096 --> 00:24:52,937
Please bear with me.

263
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:13,760
In a nutshell, I've been here five years, standing every December when you set the tax rate, and I am pushing for the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption.

264
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:17,862
They do this in Somerville, Everett, and in Malden.

265
00:25:19,884 --> 00:25:29,269
And I would like to see us get the automatic 20% advantage for our owner-occupied.

266
00:25:30,859 --> 00:25:56,909
as long as the council votes for it in majority and also the mirror says yes and you automatically just meal it, send it into the state house and it's automatically approved up to 20% other cities around here that are bordering us are at higher than 20% they asked for a special exclusion up to 35% and maybe others are at even 37.5%

267
00:26:00,337 --> 00:26:07,040
Last year I made my first ever petition presentation and similar matter document.

268
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,921
S 15 dash seven nine four.

269
00:26:11,281 --> 00:26:26,147
I made a petition by Andrew P Castanetti 23 asking that the council to adopt mass general laws chapter 59 section five C for owner occupied real estate tax exemption.

270
00:26:28,258 --> 00:26:32,080
Thank you for allowing me to present that prior to your vote last year.

271
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:42,284
Also in September of that year, prior to the, the great debate.

272
00:26:43,805 --> 00:26:49,367
And actually this finally was asked during the second great debate.

273
00:26:50,988 --> 00:26:56,490
And I believe I probably had this published and Escobar's method transcript.

274
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,671
And this is a question,

275
00:26:58,453 --> 00:27:08,416
I wrote up date of September 30th, 2015 question for all city of Medford politics and candidates.

276
00:27:09,216 --> 00:27:13,837
Are you for or against the home on owner occupied real estate tax exemption?

277
00:27:14,737 --> 00:27:23,880
Go to Commonwealth Massachusetts website referred to mass general laws chapter 59 section five C one Massachusetts cities are

278
00:27:24,515 --> 00:27:30,417
already presently given this real estate tax savings to its owner-occupied homeowners.

279
00:27:30,877 --> 00:27:34,518
This includes three bordering cities, Malden, Everett, and Somerville.

280
00:27:34,938 --> 00:27:37,559
My question is, why not here in Medford?

281
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:47,022
For the past 40 or more years, our real estate tax bill in Medford has increased over 2.5 percent per year.

282
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:52,484
If this automatic 20 percent exemption outlined in

283
00:27:54,023 --> 00:28:07,892
Chapter 59, Section 5C, is adopted, the average owner-occupied homeowner, if you live on that one house, would receive a $200 savings a year instead of the usual $200 increase.

284
00:28:08,912 --> 00:28:14,916
That's a $400 swing times 12,000 owner-occupieds.

285
00:28:15,616 --> 00:28:17,057
Those are tens of millions of dollars.

286
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:22,921
Again, I am asking, why not here in this city?

287
00:28:23,906 --> 00:28:42,612
I'm asking all city council and mayoral candidates to respond to this question before the upcoming election so that the voters have ample time to read your responses and cast their ballots for candidates who support tax relief for the citizens of our fair city.

288
00:28:43,873 --> 00:28:50,575
Please send your written response to the method transcript, letters to the editor, and to We the People.

289
00:28:50,815 --> 00:28:52,576
Thank you for your attention and your response

290
00:28:53,649 --> 00:29:02,775
submitted by Andrew P. To this day, I have not received any responses in writing to the transcript or to me personally.

291
00:29:07,678 --> 00:29:16,504
It just seems to me that this is way past due to give our middle class some tax relief for the first time ever in my lifetime that I know of.

292
00:29:19,305 --> 00:29:19,846
The $650,000 push

293
00:29:22,603 --> 00:29:30,992
valuation would be slight increases above that with the adoption of what I'm talking about.

294
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,536
And below that, they would all save money.

295
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:44,167
In a nutshell, they would save $200 to $300, not having today's numbers, of course.

296
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:52,933
And opposed to the opposite direction, so you're talking like $500 to $600 swing difference, again, times 12,000 owner-occupied.

297
00:29:52,973 --> 00:29:54,994
That's tens of millions of dollars.

298
00:29:57,555 --> 00:30:14,743
It seems kind of sad to me that we cannot help the middle class, because the middle class, in my day, as a youth, dad worked, mom stood home, took care of the kids, and bought a house, saved money,

299
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:29,055
Today, if both people are working at what kind of job, I don't know, whatever benefits they may not have, they can't have a hard time paying their bills, let alone saving.

300
00:30:33,016 --> 00:30:44,200
So if the middle class is going to continue in this direction, on one shoulder, they carry the rich that don't want to pay taxes or refuse to.

301
00:30:46,412 --> 00:31:01,935
And then on the other shoulder, they're carrying citizens or non-citizens who are getting checks from federal government, who can work, but maybe refuse to work.

302
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:12,137
So if you collapse the middle class, I believe common sense would dictate that we wouldn't have a society worth a damn.

303
00:31:14,778 --> 00:31:15,238
And then?

304
00:31:15,677 --> 00:31:17,278
there might be the second revolution.

305
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:25,084
Maybe Bernie Sanders made a good point once upon a time.

306
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:29,567
He was telling me about this so-called rigged system.

307
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:44,178
And I remember one astute individual once said, we can have democracy in this country, or we can have a few capitalists control most of the wealth, but we can't have both.

308
00:31:50,135 --> 00:31:51,436
Thank you very much, Mr. Andrew.

309
00:31:52,216 --> 00:31:53,517
Simply put, why not us?

310
00:31:54,057 --> 00:31:56,318
The ball is in your court, in the mayor's.

311
00:31:57,979 --> 00:31:58,780
People need relief.

312
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:10,846
Thank you if you're listening, and I have a whole box of thank yous if you do something positive, up to the 20%, which is automatic, and the numbers tell the truth.

313
00:32:11,987 --> 00:32:18,150
The average homeowner is gonna save 200 instead of pay $200 more for the first time ever.

314
00:32:20,844 --> 00:32:24,247
think of those hundred dollar bills, $20 million worth.

315
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:29,951
Counselor night.

316
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:34,734
You might tend to stand that a, your motion is to take up the whole paper, full point paper before us.

317
00:32:35,174 --> 00:32:44,621
Um, actually Mr. President, I was going to go item by item, um, by voting yes to, uh, adopt the lowest minimum residential factor and then the next

318
00:32:45,401 --> 00:32:49,724
Motion would be on the open space discount, and the next motion would be on the residential exemption.

319
00:32:50,145 --> 00:32:50,505
Very good.

320
00:32:50,805 --> 00:32:52,286
We'll take up the B paper first.

321
00:32:52,867 --> 00:33:01,574
So on the motion of Vice President Lungo Kern to reduce the tax rate by the tax levy by $500,000, did I understand you correct, Madam Vice President?

322
00:33:01,694 --> 00:33:02,314
Roll call, please.

323
00:33:03,015 --> 00:33:04,296
Was I correct in my statement?

324
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:04,476
Yes.

325
00:33:04,836 --> 00:33:05,256
Thank you.

326
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,499
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll on that motion on the B paper.

327
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:13,103
Councilor Caviello?

328
00:33:13,164 --> 00:33:13,404
No.

329
00:33:14,404 --> 00:33:15,125
Councilor Falco?

330
00:33:15,245 --> 00:33:15,445
No.

331
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:16,806
Councilor Night?

332
00:33:16,906 --> 00:33:17,126
No.

333
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:19,167
Vice-President Lueb and Kern?

334
00:33:19,187 --> 00:33:19,307
Yes.

335
00:33:19,987 --> 00:33:20,588
Councilor Moxley?

336
00:33:20,788 --> 00:33:21,088
Yes.

337
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:22,569
Councilor Scott Kelly?

338
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:22,689
No.

339
00:33:22,749 --> 00:33:24,610
Vice-President Dela Ruzzo?

340
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:24,910
No.

341
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:32,635
With the vote of five and the negative two in the affirmative, the motion fails.

342
00:33:34,256 --> 00:33:34,596
Next.

343
00:33:35,336 --> 00:33:36,237
Mr. President, motion.

344
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:37,898
On the main motion, Councilor Night.

345
00:33:43,320 --> 00:34:01,991
One, to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2010 on the motion of approval by Councillor Knight by selecting the minimum residential factor, a percentage of the total tax levy will be shifted from the residential taxpayer to the commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

346
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:10,817
This results in a lower tax rate for the residential properties and a higher tax rate for commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

347
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:15,081
Historically, the council has chosen the minimum residential factor.

348
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:20,284
If this is once again, the council choice, the minimum residential factor is 0.903265.

349
00:34:24,247 --> 00:34:29,931
On the motion for approval on that by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

350
00:34:33,093 --> 00:34:33,954
Councilor Caviello?

351
00:34:33,994 --> 00:34:34,174
Yes.

352
00:34:34,855 --> 00:34:35,655
Councilor Falco?

353
00:34:35,795 --> 00:34:35,995
Yes.

354
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:37,136
Councilor Knight?

355
00:34:37,336 --> 00:34:37,616
Yes.

356
00:34:38,197 --> 00:34:39,178
Vice-President Locker?

357
00:34:39,198 --> 00:34:39,338
Yes.

358
00:34:40,275 --> 00:34:40,895
Councillor Marks?

359
00:34:41,136 --> 00:34:41,336
Yes.

360
00:34:42,156 --> 00:34:42,957
Councillor Scarpelli?

361
00:34:43,077 --> 00:34:43,297
Yes.

362
00:34:44,038 --> 00:34:44,898
President De La Rosa?

363
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:45,299
Yes.

364
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:50,422
With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion carries.

365
00:34:51,203 --> 00:34:53,885
Two, adopt an open space discount.

366
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:58,908
This does not apply in the city of Medford, but a no vote is required.

367
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,950
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

368
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:05,503
Councilor Caviello?

369
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:05,744
No.

370
00:35:06,724 --> 00:35:07,544
Councilor Falco?

371
00:35:07,684 --> 00:35:07,784
No.

372
00:35:08,665 --> 00:35:09,325
Councilor Night?

373
00:35:09,425 --> 00:35:09,685
No.

374
00:35:10,506 --> 00:35:11,506
Vice President Laura Curran?

375
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:11,606
No.

376
00:35:12,386 --> 00:35:13,047
Councilor Montz?

377
00:35:13,187 --> 00:35:13,487
No.

378
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:15,508
Councilor Scott Kelly?

379
00:35:15,608 --> 00:35:15,908
No.

380
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,128
President Dela Cruz?

381
00:35:17,188 --> 00:35:17,469
No.

382
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:26,032
With the vote of seven and the negative, the adoption of an open space discount is declined.

383
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:29,994
Three, adopt a residential exemption.

384
00:35:30,634 --> 00:35:34,416
If adopted, owner-occupied residential properties may receive an exemption

385
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:38,074
of up to 35% of the average residential value.

386
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:45,959
This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the tax levy from the owner-occupied residential properties to non-owner-occupied properties.

387
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:55,704
Since this shift causes a higher residential tax rate, a number of the owner-occupied properties would also see an increase in their tax bills.

388
00:35:55,784 --> 00:35:57,626
This was outlined for us.

389
00:35:58,206 --> 00:36:01,568
And so a no to adopt would be required

390
00:36:02,062 --> 00:36:04,223
to follow our natural course of things.

391
00:36:04,303 --> 00:36:05,784
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

392
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,065
Councilor Caviello?

393
00:36:08,105 --> 00:36:08,305
No.

394
00:36:09,046 --> 00:36:09,746
Councilor Falcone?

395
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:10,846
No.

396
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:11,447
Councilor Naye?

397
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:11,827
No.

398
00:36:12,607 --> 00:36:13,588
Vice-President O'Kerry?

399
00:36:14,168 --> 00:36:14,328
No.

400
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:15,769
Councilor Mox?

401
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:15,889
No.

402
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:17,530
Councilor Scarpelli?

403
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:17,870
No.

404
00:36:18,871 --> 00:36:19,611
President Del Rosso?

405
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:20,011
No.

406
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:30,637
To adopt on that is a seven in the negative, none in the affirmative, no to adopt on 35.

407
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,742
of the average residential value.

408
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:37,225
And finally, adopt a small commercial exemption.

409
00:36:37,825 --> 00:36:50,096
If adopted, commercial properties, housing, and business employing 10 or less people valued at less than $1 million may receive an exemption of up to 10% of their assessed value.

410
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:57,883
This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the commercial industrial tax levy from these eligible properties to other commercial indoor industrial properties.

411
00:36:58,343 --> 00:37:07,525
Since the shift causes a higher commercial and industrial tax rate, all commercial industrial not receiving the exemption would see an increase in their tax bills.

412
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:15,808
As part of this hearing, it is the duty of the Board of Assessors to notify the Council of any excess levy capacity fiscal year 2017.

413
00:37:16,728 --> 00:37:18,208
Excess levy capacity is $96,627.99.

414
00:37:24,584 --> 00:37:27,246
Four, adopt a small commercial exemption.

415
00:37:27,266 --> 00:37:33,889
A no to stay the course as previously charted.

416
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,350
It will be required here.

417
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,271
Mr. Clerk, call the roll.

418
00:37:37,992 --> 00:37:38,912
Councilor Caviello?

419
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:39,233
No.

420
00:37:40,093 --> 00:37:40,854
Councilor Falco?

421
00:37:40,994 --> 00:37:41,194
No.

422
00:37:41,794 --> 00:37:42,354
Councilor Knight?

423
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:42,655
No.

424
00:37:43,315 --> 00:37:44,255
Vice President Leonard Kern?

425
00:37:44,276 --> 00:37:44,376
No.

426
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:45,796
Councilor Marks?

427
00:37:45,816 --> 00:37:45,916
No.

428
00:37:47,157 --> 00:37:47,978
Councilor Scott Belli?

429
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:48,278
No.

430
00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:49,679
President De La Rucia?

431
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:50,039
No.

432
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,601
With a vote of seven in the negative, none in the affirmative.

433
00:37:54,109 --> 00:37:57,871
The adoption of a small commercial exemption is declined.

434
00:37:59,232 --> 00:38:02,775
Therefore, we have completed our tax work for this year.

435
00:38:03,375 --> 00:38:09,879
Congratulations to the counselors, uh, for the debate and, uh, for their hard work on this matter.

436
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:21,587
And certainly, uh, congratulations to, uh, Ed O'Neill and Elisa Nunley.

437
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:24,828
Thank you, Mr. President.

438
00:38:24,848 --> 00:38:25,948
I'm going to get it, Alicia.

439
00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:27,169
It's coming.

440
00:38:27,629 --> 00:38:28,749
Fellow counselors, thank you.

441
00:38:28,769 --> 00:38:29,850
You guys did beautiful work.

442
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,090
Thank you for your hard work.

443
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:36,511
Thank you for coming in, in a couple months for all the advancements you've made.

444
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:38,492
Uh, you're a true professional.

445
00:38:38,532 --> 00:38:38,872
Thank you.

446
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:41,073
Motion to suspend Mr. President.

447
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:44,073
On the motion to suspend the rules to take something.

448
00:38:44,093 --> 00:38:44,073
16804.

449
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,174
16804 offered by Councilor Knight.

450
00:38:51,335 --> 00:38:54,196
to take 16-804, communications from the mayor.

451
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:56,537
To, all those in favor?

452
00:38:56,557 --> 00:38:57,057
Aye.

453
00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:58,017
All those opposed?

454
00:38:59,118 --> 00:39:04,059
Communications from the mayor, December 7th, 2016, to President Frederick N. Del Rosso Jr.

455
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,861
and members of the Medford City Council, from Stephanie M. Burke, mayor.

456
00:39:08,341 --> 00:39:17,264
Reacceptance of a grant from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the National AL Park Service Land and Water Conservation Fund

457
00:39:17,826 --> 00:39:25,332
for improvements to Riverside Plaza and to appropriate the funds necessary for the implementation of this project.

458
00:39:25,832 --> 00:39:47,488
Dear President De La Russo and members, esteemed members of the Medford City Council, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the National Park Service have awarded reimbursement grant of $250,000 in federal land and water conservation fund assistance to the city for reconstruction of Riverside Plaza to serve its residents.

459

Acceptance of this federal grant requires that the property remain open to the general public and prohibits any use other than outdoor recreation at the site in perpetuity.

460
00:39:59,729 --> 00:40:04,471
The land must be dedicated to Chapter 45, Section 3.

461
00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:17,176
Conservation of the property is non-recreational use requires that the Parks Board to abide by Article 97 of the Article of Amendment to the state constitution as well as the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund

462
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:18,423

463
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:31,331
Implementation of the project will cost an estimated total of $550,000, and this sum will be appropriated and allocated to the project by the city prior to the execution of the grant agreement.

464
00:40:31,811 --> 00:40:40,035
I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honourable Body adopt the attached resolution to accept the grant and to appropriate the sum of $550,000 for implementation of the project

465
00:40:43,551 --> 00:40:52,937
the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund grant will reimburse $250,000 on completion of the project.

466
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:54,878
Mr. President, motion to waive.

467
00:40:54,898 --> 00:40:57,619
Signature on file, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

468
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:03,383
On the motion of Councilor Knight that I waive the rest of this tedious reading.

469
00:41:03,403 --> 00:41:04,644
All those in favor?

470
00:41:05,184 --> 00:41:06,024
All those opposed?

471
00:41:06,084 --> 00:41:06,825
Thank you very much.

472
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:11,748
And we welcome our OCD Director, Lauren DiLorenzo, to the podium to share with us

473
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:14,176
synopsis of this project.

474
00:41:14,476 --> 00:41:17,057
Thank you very much, Mr. President, members of the council.

475
00:41:18,097 --> 00:41:29,962
I am happy to say, as the president has said, the city has been successful in receiving a grant of $250,000 federal land and water conservation grant funds that are actually administered through the state.

476
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:38,046
So we're very fortunate to be chosen because of our successful track record, really working with the state on various public spaces.

477
00:41:38,904 --> 00:41:42,045
This project is a renovation of the Riverside Plaza.

478
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:47,246
It's that land area where the bus shelter is off of Riverside Avenue and River Street and Medford Square.

479
00:41:47,986 --> 00:42:07,992
Mayor Burke has worked with residents, as I know many of you councils have also, to identify the desire for people to be able to have a location in Medford Square that is vibrant, where they can exercise their cultural interests, their artistic interests,

480
00:42:08,506 --> 00:42:14,368
and create some type of a recreational resource that allows people to gather, congregate, and have activities.

481
00:42:14,388 --> 00:42:20,230
It's the main focus of this renovation is to really bring vitality back to Medford Square.

482
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,851
And of course, that's not all that's going to be needed in Medford Square.

483
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:32,835
We've been talking about the renovation plans and the master plan for Medford Square, which is underway with MAPC, working with the mayor's office to identify the other guide

484
00:42:33,245 --> 00:42:39,271
guides and the infrastructure improvements and things, business development, things that we need in order to make Medford Square more competitive.

485
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:43,274
But this is something that's a little bit more fun, but it's necessary also.

486
00:42:43,614 --> 00:42:59,569
The idea to have a place where people can actually socialize at Medford Square, be safe, be well lit, to be attractive and to be a place where you can now, you know, be yourself and socialize, whether it's teenagers or young children with their families,

487
00:43:00,593 --> 00:43:05,837
people who are working in the downtown area just want to go get a sandwich at Medford Square and sit down at a bench and eat their lunch.

488
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,938
So I think this is a great project.

489
00:43:07,978 --> 00:43:08,879
I hope you agree with it.

490
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,462
The paper before you asks that these are all necessary as part of the grant application.

491
00:43:14,142 --> 00:43:25,550
Ask the council generally, I won't go through all those things that the president did, but they require the acceptance of the grant and appropriation of the $550,000, which is the budget, the project costs.

492
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:28,332
The council has received a presentation on this project.

493
00:43:28,636 --> 00:43:31,698
It's in schematic, which is basically, it's generally an idea.

494
00:43:31,758 --> 00:43:39,522
It's not completely designed to the level of specification of construction documents, but it's enough to give you a sense of what the components of the project will be.

495
00:43:40,263 --> 00:43:48,187
Components of the project will have seating, fixed seating and movable seating so that there could be some congregation of people for various activities.

496
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:58,233
There will be areas where there could be some tents that people could put up in order to sell their wares or have some things like the farmer's market or sell people who are selling jewelry or things that they've perhaps made.

497
00:43:58,828 --> 00:44:05,849
There'll be a little stage area for some small performances by people who have more talent than I do in order to perform music.

498
00:44:06,389 --> 00:44:11,250
And there will be some components that are park-like, but it's not really a park.

499
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:17,591
So perhaps it'll be a musical instrument that a child could go up and touch and just make some noise and express themselves in that way.

500
00:44:18,331 --> 00:44:23,772
And there's been requests to add some fitness-related recreation equipment that will be included also.

501
00:44:24,092 --> 00:44:26,893
So I think I've touched on each of the key components of that.

502
00:44:27,856 --> 00:44:32,341
It's a lot to be programmed in a very small space, but we think that it will be successful.

503
00:44:32,942 --> 00:44:37,427
This application also requires that this land be preserved in perpetuity.

504
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:46,778
There was questions about what that meant, which I believe the city solicitor did answer, and the committee of the whole meeting, and that that park be placed under the care and control of the park board.

505
00:44:47,904 --> 00:44:56,451
The final is the authorization for the treasurer to do the borrowing and to utilize the money that is received under the bonds in order to fund the project costs.

506
00:44:56,471 --> 00:45:00,014
So that's generally what's before, excuse me, before the council tonight.

507
00:45:01,015 --> 00:45:06,859
We are supposed to get this grant approval from the council into the state by the 31st.

508
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,121
I know it requires several readings.

509
00:45:09,161 --> 00:45:16,327
I think if they have an indication that the council's moving forward in a positive manner on this, that they would accept that this paper came in in the first week in January.

510
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,881
So I ask you for your support.

511
00:45:18,461 --> 00:45:18,821
Thank you.

512
00:45:18,881 --> 00:45:27,207
And as Lauren mentioned, uh, we discussed this in two committee of the whole meetings and we had a number of our, uh, concerns addressed.

513
00:45:27,287 --> 00:45:45,078
And we also had, uh, by way of a special visitor from the office down the hall, the city solicitor, uh, wonderful and clear discourse on the concept of, uh, uh, perpetuity as applied within this document, as opposed to,

514
00:45:46,602 --> 00:45:48,644
other applications of the word.

515
00:45:50,065 --> 00:45:50,425
Thank you.

516
00:45:50,565 --> 00:45:51,827
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

517
00:45:52,247 --> 00:45:52,968
Thank you Mr. President.

518
00:45:53,368 --> 00:46:03,497
Mr. President, over the past year, I've attended many, many meetings in this, uh, in this building, uh, with the revitalization reference square and other parts of the city.

519
00:46:04,578 --> 00:46:13,205
Um, and what I hear is that the, uh, the businesses in the downtown area are looking for something, uh, to happen and happen soon.

520
00:46:14,386 --> 00:46:31,330
And I would hope with the implementation of this project, maybe this will be the catalyst to hopefully get the project moving at maybe a quicker pace and to let the business people see that the city is serious about doing something.

521
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:40,172
I was able to talk to the developer last week that was here from, I should be the gentleman who was running the meeting last week.

522
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:43,573
And I expressed some of my concerns to him about how,

523
00:46:44,723 --> 00:46:50,527
The businesses aren't coming to these meetings because they don't see anything happening and they want to see something happening.

524
00:46:51,228 --> 00:47:03,397
And like I said, hopefully with the start of this, maybe this will send the message to them that, uh, this is the start of something and maybe we could, uh, train it up a notch and get, and get the project moving a little faster.

525
00:47:04,157 --> 00:47:07,160
So, um, I would support this, uh, Mr. President.

526
00:47:11,483 --> 00:47:11,843
Very good.

527
00:47:11,883 --> 00:47:14,125
So on the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello,

528
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,931
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

529
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:17,651
Mr. President, thank you very much.

530
00:47:17,691 --> 00:47:18,232
And Ms.

531
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,252
DiLorenzo, thank you.

532
00:47:19,272 --> 00:47:19,512
And Ms.

533
00:47:19,532 --> 00:47:21,633
Crosby, if she's still here, thank you for your presentation.

534
00:47:21,773 --> 00:47:23,454
The last couple of weeks really appreciate it.

535
00:47:25,015 --> 00:47:35,739
This is an interesting project, Mr. President, and I think that it's a good approach for us to take in a way to address a need in our downtown district and also begin to revitalize Medford square.

536
00:47:35,779 --> 00:47:41,782
When we look at this project and this plan, it falls in line with some of the goals that are outlined in our open space and recreation plan.

537
00:47:42,393 --> 00:47:55,543
Um, it also allows us to take an underutilized and underdeveloped portion of our downtown district and put it under the control and jurisdiction of the parks commission, which allows us the opportunity to better control the use at that area.

538
00:47:55,563 --> 00:47:58,545
Mr. President, right now it's just an open public space, a public sidewalk.

539
00:47:58,726 --> 00:48:01,228
Uh, there's no anti-loitering ordinance in the city of Medford.

540
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:05,351
I'd question is whether or not that would even be something that the city of Medford could implement as being legal.

541
00:48:05,971 --> 00:48:08,293
Um, however, when we have a public park in the downtown,

542
00:48:08,917 --> 00:48:10,839
We can put restrictions around that public park.

543
00:48:10,879 --> 00:48:13,102
We can say that people can't be in the park after dusk.

544
00:48:13,142 --> 00:48:16,145
We can say that this area cannot be congregated in for certain times.

545
00:48:16,205 --> 00:48:20,170
We can permit the area for use, for certain specified uses, Mr. President.

546
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:24,755
So I think that this is a great approach to addressing several of the issues that the community is facing here.

547
00:48:25,415 --> 00:48:28,739
We need some passive recreation areas in our downtown district.

548
00:48:29,549 --> 00:48:39,172
We have an opportunity to now connect the nice sitting area in front of Century Bank, with a nice sitting area in front of the Salem Street Burial Ground, with a nice sitting area in front of the Senior Center.

549
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:44,894
With any luck, the Clippership Connector is going to come through and we'll be able to traverse right into McDonald Park.

550
00:48:45,994 --> 00:48:54,177
So I really think that this is the beginning of the city creating its own Emerald Necklace, similar to that of the pathway system that the DCI has established, Mr. President.

551
00:48:55,297 --> 00:48:56,338
So with that being said,

552
00:48:57,381 --> 00:48:59,682
this is something that I'll be supporting this evening and I move approval.

553
00:49:00,423 --> 00:49:08,747
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks.

554
00:49:10,168 --> 00:49:11,108
Thank you, Mr. President.

555
00:49:11,128 --> 00:49:15,090
And I want to thank Lauren and her office for working on this proposal.

556
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:26,536
It was roughly a year and a half, two years ago, I offered a resolution before this council that was unanimously supported to repurpose the bus shelter

557
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:32,606
that is at the existing site currently that was dilapidated and falling apart.

558
00:49:33,026 --> 00:49:50,131
So I'm happy to hear that the officer community development has worked on this particular project to revitalize an area that I admit is a tough area, a tough location where it's nestled between a busy, too busy streets and a cemetery.

559
00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:53,832
And I can appreciate all the work that went into this.

560
00:49:54,632 --> 00:49:56,793
The one concern I do have, which I've raised,

561
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:00,392
at the committee, the whole meeting is the funding mechanism.

562
00:50:01,472 --> 00:50:09,516
And, um, this project is a total cost 550,000 of which, uh, the city has applied for a federal grant of 250,000.

563
00:50:09,556 --> 00:50:22,603
The, uh, stipulation of the grant is that, uh, this property can only be used for recreational purposes, open outdoor recreational purposes.

564
00:50:23,343 --> 00:50:24,904
And it does say in perpetuity.

565
00:50:25,404 --> 00:50:26,965
So we had the city solicitor,

566
00:50:27,667 --> 00:50:28,908
uh, attend our meeting tonight.

567
00:50:29,648 --> 00:50:38,971
And, uh, he gave an answer, which I think, uh, caught some of us by surprise, uh, cause, uh, in perpetuity to me means forever.

568
00:50:40,072 --> 00:50:42,413
And, uh, I still believe it means forever.

569
00:50:43,213 --> 00:50:52,456
And, uh, in order to receive the grant from the federal government, uh, we have to assure the federal government that this property will only be used for that purpose.

570
00:50:53,537 --> 00:50:56,418
And I, as one member of the council, knowing that,

571
00:50:56,956 --> 00:51:09,545
Uh, we have a $9,709,000 in free cash on hand at this particular time that, um, I don't want to see any restrictions on the reuse of that particular parcel.

572
00:51:10,326 --> 00:51:16,110
And, uh, I think, uh, allowing, uh, the use of the grant, which is great.

573
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:20,353
I'm all in favor of getting grants and I wish the city would seek more grants.

574
00:51:21,153 --> 00:51:26,217
Uh, but the stipulation of, uh, having a piece of property that's centrally located

575
00:51:26,694 --> 00:51:40,560
in our business district in the midst of, um, the, uh, method working metropolitan area planning, uh, commission working on a master plan with the city to revitalize our downtown business district.

576
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:53,385
I think that we have to be more prudent and, uh, in my opinion, uh, using free cash to pay for this particular project would be prudent would be a way that we could see this come to fruition.

577
00:51:54,127 --> 00:52:04,230
and would be a way to accomplish all our goals as the director of community development mentioned about creating open space, creating a gathering spot.

578
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:16,513
If you look at the 2005 report that was issued that the city commissioned for the revitalization of Meffitt Square, it outlined a need for a gathering spot in the downtown business district.

579
00:52:17,173 --> 00:52:19,454
And I think this addresses that particular need.

580
00:52:19,894 --> 00:52:21,234
So I support the project.

581
00:52:21,935 --> 00:52:23,055
I think it's a great project.

582
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:32,175
However, the funding I do not support and I don't think we should handcuff ourselves on any type of language that talks in perpetuity.

583
00:52:32,195 --> 00:52:39,438
Um, we heard tonight, uh, the city solicitors say, well, perpetuity doesn't really necessarily mean perpetuity.

584
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:46,440
Uh, if need be, you may need to only pay back the original grant amount if you want to change the reuse.

585
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:52,563
So, uh, you know, I, I don't feel comfortable as one member of the council, uh, accepting the grant.

586
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:55,666
um, and feel that we should use free cash.

587
00:52:56,066 --> 00:52:56,807
Mr. President.

588
00:52:57,487 --> 00:53:22,337
Um, I would also, uh, ask that, um, in addition to, uh, looking at that parcel, uh, Mr. President, and I'm sure the, um, master plan committee is also looking at the parcel here located behind city hall, uh, which is in the parking lot of the hotel, but it's the parking lot of the hotel, the old roots parking lot and the parking lot directly out here behind city hall.

589
00:53:22,942 --> 00:53:24,944
uh, for potential growth within our community.

590
00:53:25,784 --> 00:53:38,553
And, um, so, uh, based on that, Mr. President, based on what I heard from the director of community development saying, well, this is the mayor's proposal and this is what she's pushing through and this is how it's going to work.

591
00:53:38,593 --> 00:53:40,295
Otherwise it's not going to happen.

592
00:53:41,075 --> 00:53:51,603
Um, I believe that it's up to this council, uh, if we see fit, uh, to use free cash, uh, in order not to restrict ourselves on the land use of that particular site.

593
00:53:53,283 --> 00:53:55,004
I think that's the way we should go, Mr. President.

594
00:53:55,404 --> 00:53:59,246
You know, it's great to say Parkland, and we're going to put it under the Park Board.

595
00:53:59,966 --> 00:54:06,009
The Park Board has a whole 20, 30-page document, what restrictions on Parkland.

596
00:54:06,689 --> 00:54:21,675
And we're going to be opening ourselves potentially up to, if someone wants to go down there and use the particular piece of property for a short period of time, that they need to reach out to the Park Board and get a permit and pay for a permit

597
00:54:22,123 --> 00:54:26,584
to use a particular piece of open space within the heart of our community.

598
00:54:27,424 --> 00:54:47,409
And I, as one member of the council, do not favor that, Mr. President, and would ask my colleagues to at least consider the option of using $250,000, Mr. President, in free cash to pay for what the grant would have paid for, Mr. President.

599
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:48,670
So that means our total would be $550,000.

600
00:54:50,482 --> 00:54:52,723
uh, in moving this worthy project forward.

601
00:54:53,003 --> 00:54:59,166
So I would offer that in the form of a resolution, Mr. President, that, uh, the council as it be paper council.

602
00:54:59,587 --> 00:54:59,847
Yes.

603
00:54:59,987 --> 00:55:18,136
The council, uh, use, uh, the appropriation of 250,000 from free cash to offset, uh, the grant that, uh, uh, would have been used, uh, for the purpose of, uh, building this particular, uh, parkland, Mr. President.

604
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:23,451
Mr. President, may I?

605
00:55:24,311 --> 00:55:25,152
You may.

606
00:55:25,592 --> 00:55:25,852
Yes.

607
00:55:26,132 --> 00:55:28,173
On that, on that, uh, item there.

608
00:55:28,593 --> 00:55:45,161
First of all, uh, what I had said was the mayor's put forth the proposal that you hear to the council tonight, which is a request for her, a bonding of the full amount of money with a 50% reimbursement money that is not repaid unless of course the city were to do go ahead and decommission that as Parkland somewhere down the road.

609
00:55:45,301 --> 00:55:48,022
Usually anytime you take a grant, if you don't,

610
00:55:48,475 --> 00:55:51,918
live out the life of that public improvement, you're required to pay those things back.

611
00:55:52,378 --> 00:55:57,222
So that $250,000 that the councillor is suggesting can be used for other purposes in the city.

612
00:55:57,542 --> 00:55:59,864
This is a 50% reimbursement grant.

613
00:55:59,884 --> 00:56:01,125
I just want to be clear about that.

614
00:56:01,846 --> 00:56:06,410
And the paper before you is with the funding as I proposed it.

615
00:56:07,671 --> 00:56:08,651
I hope that's what you vote on.

616
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:10,373
Thank you.

617
00:56:10,933 --> 00:56:12,535
Chair recognizes Vice President Ogunkar.

618
00:56:14,877 --> 00:56:16,358
Thank you, President Dela Rousseau.

619
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:26,658
My question, I understand Councillor Marks' point and it was cleared up to me by City Solicitor Rumley who said the use could be changed.

620
00:56:26,699 --> 00:56:30,364
Now, if we change the use in five years, do we have to pay the federal government back?

621
00:56:30,558 --> 00:56:35,900
It's very likely that if you didn't live out the purpose of the park and the perpetuity that you would have to pay.

622
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,163
And federal grants with CDBG funds, if somebody is borrowing money for us, the public improvement is five years.

623
00:56:42,183 --> 00:56:46,284
So it's some reasonable period of time they would require you to do that.

624
00:56:46,345 --> 00:56:50,346
But I mean, I think the intention here really is clear.

625
00:56:50,746 --> 00:56:52,087
And that is an open space.

626
00:56:52,127 --> 00:56:54,108
It's a small space, as I said, in the Committee of the Whole.

627
00:56:54,368 --> 00:56:59,630
The idea is to create more spaces and to protect them for this kind of purpose, for recreation,

628
00:57:00,093 --> 00:57:01,895
and open space and cultural purposes.

629
00:57:01,915 --> 00:57:15,752
I mean, I think that's clearly an important part of this project is that we make a commitment in Medford Square to these components of what we think is going to be important to create a vital downtown area.

630
00:57:16,346 --> 00:57:21,230
And I really don't think that there may be things, uses on that park that you may wanna change.

631
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:22,911
Maybe you wanna change equipment.

632
00:57:22,951 --> 00:57:28,455
Maybe you wanna permit somebody to do some type of consumer sales for a certain period of time.

633
00:57:28,495 --> 00:57:33,899
But the idea of creating a space and having it there, I don't really see as a five-year commitment.

634
00:57:33,939 --> 00:57:36,081
I think that's a commitment of this council.

635
00:57:37,042 --> 00:57:40,604
And I think that as you make this vote, that's what you say.

636
00:57:40,764 --> 00:57:45,728
You say you're making a commitment to public recreation and cultural spaces in Bedford Square.

637
00:57:47,239 --> 00:58:02,967
Okay, and then with regards to the $550,000 grant, was there ever any discussion with regards to accepting the grant but taking the $200,000, going out to bond for $300,000 and then taking $250,000 out of free cash and then reimbursing free cash?

638
00:58:03,227 --> 00:58:04,988
The mayor proposed that it go off a bond.

639
00:58:05,008 --> 00:58:07,629
I did not have any discussion with her about other sources of money.

640
00:58:07,729 --> 00:58:11,551
I assume that she had the bigger picture of the budget and that this is what she was recommending.

641
00:58:11,611 --> 00:58:14,533
So I accepted what her recommendation was and I did not question it.

642
00:58:15,671 --> 00:58:39,824
I just ask because, again, I believe with regards to the police station, that was mainly going to be a bond, and the reason why, and I'm not quoting the mayor, but when we were in our meeting, the reason why it was several years out is because we're waiting for things to come off the books so that we can put the police station on the books with regards to the bond books.

643
00:58:42,525 --> 00:58:50,949
this is, is a great project, but it concerns me that we're going to, if we're going to get additional projects before we get the police station proposal.

644
00:58:51,609 --> 00:59:07,197
Um, so that's why I asked, I think if it, if we had 250 come out of free cash and then reimburse, you know, mandate that we reimburse free cash, that might be a way to put less money on the books bond wise and eventually hopefully do the police station sooner than later.

645
00:59:07,217 --> 00:59:08,898
So that's why I didn't know if that,

646
00:59:09,505 --> 00:59:10,866
I didn't realize she was still here.

647
00:59:11,186 --> 00:59:11,566
Okay.

648
00:59:11,806 --> 00:59:12,347
Be my guest.

649
00:59:12,927 --> 00:59:17,569
Through the chair, I don't understand what you mean about reimbursing free cash.

650
00:59:17,629 --> 00:59:24,873
What I see here is a $250,000 grant being awarded that she wants for a $550,000 project.

651
00:59:25,493 --> 00:59:28,294
So about half the project would be funded through the grant.

652
00:59:29,175 --> 00:59:30,636
Right, but we have to fully fund $550,000.

653
00:59:30,736 --> 00:59:37,259
Correct, and I think she put in the bond, and as you stated earlier, she has that capital improvement plan.

654
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:45,909
in addition to the capital improvement plan, she also has planned that police station and to pay the debt on the borrowing of the police station, she's going to use free cash.

655
00:59:48,690 --> 01:00:01,776
Maybe on a side motion, if we get clarification with regards to the plan on how we're going to, um, what the plan is, even if it's not for another couple of years, per the mayor's proposal to us, what that plan is.

656
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:02,096
Cause I'm,

657
01:00:02,816 --> 01:00:07,998
hearing two different things in the last couple of months with regards to how we're going to move forward on the police station.

658
01:00:08,018 --> 01:00:23,783
So if we get clarification from the administration's office, that'd be great paper to, for the mayor's office to clarify to the city council, uh, regards to funding mechanisms that she anticipates will be used to, uh, deal with the police station project for the 20 million.

659
01:00:23,803 --> 01:00:24,303
Yes, please.

660
01:00:24,624 --> 01:00:24,944
Thank you.

661
01:00:25,704 --> 01:00:28,805
And my question, Mr. Clark, thank you.

662
01:00:29,605 --> 01:00:30,205
And your motion.

663
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:31,626
Okay.

664
01:00:32,154 --> 01:00:37,876
If we go out to bond for the full 550, do we have a commitment that once we get reimbursement, it's going to go towards that bond?

665
01:00:39,156 --> 01:00:43,178
I think that's part of the paper that's used for the proceeds and I think that was at the end of it.

666
01:00:44,898 --> 01:00:48,159
Number seven, does that address your concern at number seven?

667
01:00:56,482 --> 01:00:57,262
Maybe applied.

668
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:04,053
So you want the $250,000 reimbursement to go toward the cost of the debt?

669
01:01:04,073 --> 01:01:05,995
Yes, I would make that a recommendation.

670
01:01:06,015 --> 01:01:07,736
I think you can make that recommendation.

671
01:01:08,817 --> 01:01:12,839
Once we get the reimbursement for the $250,000, we pay down the bond immediately.

672
01:01:12,879 --> 01:01:20,665
We don't use that for the general fund and keep the bond open $550,000 because we are going to need to be able to go to bond.

673
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,907
We're not going to have $20 million in free cash.

674
01:01:22,927 --> 01:01:25,428
We're going to have to go out to bond for some portion of the police station.

675
01:01:25,809 --> 01:01:27,189
I thought it was going to be the full, at least $18,000.

676
01:01:28,325 --> 01:01:30,726
So maybe once we get clarification, we'll know more.

677
01:01:33,387 --> 01:01:39,931
So we have a motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

678
01:01:40,811 --> 01:01:50,736
As a B paper, we have a motion by Councilor Marks that $250,000 for this project be taken from free cash.

679
01:01:51,456 --> 01:01:53,277
And we have a C paper before us.

680
01:01:53,975 --> 01:02:13,306
by vice president Longo Kern, uh, that the mayor report back to the council, uh, as to the, uh, details of the funding, uh, mechanisms she uses, uh, intends to engage, uh, for the purpose of construction and design of our anticipated, uh, new police station.

681
01:02:13,766 --> 01:02:15,287
And that it is further resolved.

682
01:02:15,527 --> 01:02:18,689
And I forget that last distinction you made that the $250,000

683
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:30,226
being immediately reimbursed upon reception from the state and federal authorities.

684
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:41,373
And while I have the floor, I don't know if Councilor Carviello is going to speak, but I think it's extremely important that it be heard loud and clear with regards to police presence in all our parks.

685
01:02:42,114 --> 01:02:46,677
He made that point in our Committee of the Whole meeting, and I think it's extremely important.

686
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:50,708
And with regards to maintenance, we've had an issue for years with maintenance.

687
01:02:50,748 --> 01:02:58,735
And I hope that if this does get approved tonight, that we not only the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden, but we make a commitment to upkeep this piece of property.

688
01:02:58,755 --> 01:03:02,918
And the last comment I'm going to make is the safety of our children.

689
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:05,480
There is a daycare that may be using this piece of property.

690
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:10,804
And I think it's seven toddlers to one adult.

691
01:03:11,205 --> 01:03:11,925
It's a lot of people.

692
01:03:11,985 --> 01:03:15,048
We want to make sure that they're away from the street and well protected.

693
01:03:16,615 --> 01:03:18,336
from the traffic that is in the area.

694
01:03:18,436 --> 01:03:26,402
But otherwise I think the project is going to definitely be an improvement for our square and be very, um, used by all.

695
01:03:27,063 --> 01:03:27,463
Thank you.

696
01:03:28,224 --> 01:03:29,104
Counsel Caviello.

697
01:03:29,425 --> 01:03:29,725
Thank you.

698
01:03:29,745 --> 01:03:30,545
Thank you, Mr. President.

699
01:03:30,626 --> 01:03:34,188
And I thank the vice president for bringing up that point about the police.

700
01:03:34,228 --> 01:03:45,737
I mean, I know I can't add it into this, but, um, during the construction of this, uh, and before I get sent, I am going to insist, uh, that, uh, uh, that we have a police presence,

701
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:51,457
there on a full time basis during the hours of operation.

702
01:03:51,477 --> 01:03:54,258
But we have, we have three sitting areas now.

703
01:03:54,978 --> 01:04:03,940
And, um, again, there are some, if you, if you're in the square on a regular basis, there is some, uh, quite a bit of undesirable element there at the moment.

704
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,360
And your remarks are part of the committee report that will be reported.

705
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,881
And I hope that the mayor would take that into consideration next year.

706
01:04:11,321 --> 01:04:11,721
Very good.

707
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:12,621
Thank you.

708
01:04:12,661 --> 01:04:15,382
So on the seat paper counselor,

709
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:17,402
Thank you, Mr. President.

710
01:04:17,422 --> 01:04:37,758
Um, at the public hearing I attended, um, there were many residents that were interested in particular from the art community of building a small structure, uh, on that particular site that could be used year round for art events to host, um, indoor and outdoor art events.

711
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:45,645
And apparently that was not, um, part of any other discussion, uh, other than that particular night.

712
01:04:46,693 --> 01:05:01,816
Also, Mr. President, it was raised by many people that actually perform and do functions that pavers, the ground, pavers are not adequate for such an outdoor space.

713
01:05:02,616 --> 01:05:08,097
And there was many concerns about trip and fall hazards and the maintenance of pavers and so forth.

714
01:05:08,837 --> 01:05:15,678
And from what we were told, I guess the designer prefers pavers

715
01:05:16,185 --> 01:05:24,566
I think that's still as part of the proposal, because we haven't seen a formalized plan yet, but is that still part of the?

716
01:05:24,646 --> 01:05:26,907
So two things, if I can respond to those.

717
01:05:26,947 --> 01:05:32,628
Number one is we did look at a building structure that was looked at in the plan, and it was not included for two reasons.

718
01:05:32,768 --> 01:05:38,489
One is that a building would take up the entire space, and there would not be any room, open space for people to perform in.

719
01:05:38,989 --> 01:05:42,189
And the second was because of cost, the budget.

720
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:45,850
The landscape architect is preferring the idea of pavers,

721
01:05:46,422 --> 01:06:01,066
but she does have to test has to still convince us that they can be constructed in a way that are not going to create an accessibility issue or, um, create some other issues, but they are preferred usually for a textural elements is what she's looking at.

722
01:06:01,106 --> 01:06:09,028
So they are in there currently is in the estimate for papers, but that may change as we move into actual design development beyond schematic design.

723
01:06:10,609 --> 01:06:15,050
Also, Mr. President, at the committee, the whole meeting, uh, I brought the fact that, uh,

724
01:06:15,978 --> 01:06:20,281
this area will be used by, uh, a lot of different, uh, residents.

725
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:30,648
Uh, and, uh, it's geared in my opinion towards, uh, younger children, uh, for many of the activities that will take place there and many of the potential uses.

726
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:38,513
Um, and, uh, I would ask that where Riverside Ave is such a very busy traveled, uh, road,

727
01:06:39,224 --> 01:07:02,363
and is a place where buses queue up waiting to take off, that some type of perimeter roping or fencing, similar to what was done across the street at the Crystal Campbell Park, Mr. President, be placed around the perimeter of that particular area.

728
01:07:03,064 --> 01:07:08,148
And I realize it's not going to stop people from exiting

729
01:07:09,645 --> 01:07:19,832
or entering, but it will act as a deterrent, Mr. President, potentially for young children not to run into a very busy street of Riverside Ave.

730
01:07:20,832 --> 01:07:23,594
The second question I have is regarding the grant itself.

731
01:07:24,515 --> 01:07:36,083
And typically in grants, they'll ask for a maintenance plan and what the expectation is of the community to maintain this particular site.

732
01:07:36,548 --> 01:07:47,210
And I was just wondering if Lauren can shed some, um, light on what our maintenance plan will be, uh, knowing that, uh, our DPW staff is at bare bones currently.

733
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:54,192
And, uh, we've added over the last couple of years, several new, uh, open spaces and park areas.

734
01:07:55,012 --> 01:08:02,754
Um, and I'd like to hear from the director of community development on what, uh, was put in the grant as in regards to maintenance.

735
01:08:03,294 --> 01:08:05,014
If there was any commitment on behalf of the city,

736
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:08,349
and what the actual maintenance plan is if there is one.

737
01:08:08,649 --> 01:08:10,411
They have not asked for a maintenance plan.

738
01:08:10,431 --> 01:08:12,152
We have not developed a maintenance plan yet.

739
01:08:12,212 --> 01:08:31,626
That will usually be done as we move forward to design, depending on the materials and the type of equipment that we do have, but clearly does, uh, add additional responsibilities on DPW, which I think, uh, uh, you know, there'll be an evaluation as to whether they're able to do that themselves or whether that's going to require additional contract labor, but that will be developed as we move ahead.

740
01:08:33,179 --> 01:08:36,321
So just so I understand, you're saying the grant did not ask for any type of maintenance plan?

741
01:08:36,341 --> 01:08:38,703
It did not ask for maintenance plans.

742
01:08:39,643 --> 01:08:42,125
So, so we're getting a $250,000 grant.

743
01:08:43,226 --> 01:08:53,192
Uh, the federal government, and maybe that's why the federal government's in the shape it's in, is not concerned how the city of Memphis is going to maintain the money that they're putting forward for this grant.

744
01:08:54,113 --> 01:09:00,517
Um, Mr. President, um, you know,

745
01:09:01,787 --> 01:09:09,974
That should have been part of the proposal that was submitted to us on how this particular property will be kept up, Mr. President.

746
01:09:10,755 --> 01:09:19,322
And I'm disappointed to see that, even though the federal government didn't ask, that there's not a plan in the works to show how we're going to maintain this particular piece of property.

747
01:09:19,643 --> 01:09:21,524
Well, I'm sure we can develop a maintenance plan.

748
01:09:21,564 --> 01:09:24,186
First, we have to get the funding approved and move ahead with the project.

749
01:09:24,227 --> 01:09:25,988
So first step is first.

750
01:09:26,048 --> 01:09:28,210
And I don't think I'm beyond first step yet.

751
01:09:29,111 --> 01:09:29,231
Well,

752
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:41,850
you know, if the city of method had a great track record on maintaining its properties, I'd say, you know what, that's probably not a bad idea, but all you need to do is come into this building and look at the roof that's leaking.

753
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:50,553
Uh, go down to a condemned DPW yard, go into a police station that, uh, the firefighters are actually picketing out front of city hall.

754
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:54,535
Uh, I'm sorry, the police are out front picketing at city hall.

755
01:09:55,275 --> 01:09:55,375
Um,

756
01:09:56,087 --> 01:09:57,788
You know, a library roof that's leaking.

757
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:04,071
Um, you know, so a lack of maintenance has been a part of the history in the city.

758
01:10:04,091 --> 01:10:06,452
Mr. President, we can develop a maintenance plan.

759
01:10:06,772 --> 01:10:15,056
So that is a concern, Mr. President, that I think we should see up front before we spend $1, Mr. President, uh, of any money.

760
01:10:15,976 --> 01:10:18,817
Um, and you know, free cash is a bud.

761
01:10:19,338 --> 01:10:22,719
Uh, all it is is a buzzword for taxpayers money.

762
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,340
That's all it is.

763
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:24,500
So,

764
01:10:24,893 --> 01:10:30,776
Don't let anyone believe that there's free cash lying around, that there's no such thing as free cash.

765
01:10:31,136 --> 01:10:41,162
This is taxpayers' money, Mr. President, and a thorough report should have been submitted to this council regarding what the maintenance plan would be before we take any vote, Mr. President.

766
01:10:42,383 --> 01:10:53,589
So I explain my vote on this, Mr. President, is based on the funding and the tying of the city's hands, not just for this council,

767
01:10:54,323 --> 01:10:58,224
but for future councils and future generations in this community.

768
01:10:58,724 --> 01:11:03,225
I don't think it's as easy to back out from the federal government as we're hearing tonight.

769
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:10,207
Don't worry if you decide to use it for another purpose in a few years from now, five, whatever it is, just pay them back.

770
01:11:10,227 --> 01:11:11,527
I don't think it's that easy.

771
01:11:11,587 --> 01:11:15,748
I don't think anybody's making a trite statement here.

772
01:11:15,768 --> 01:11:21,830
Nobody's making a trivial statement here about maintenance or about the investment of public money.

773
01:11:22,234 --> 01:11:29,757
the art, the, the, the, the, what the paper is before you is to actually save 50% of the cost by accepting a grant instead of using the free cash.

774
01:11:30,237 --> 01:11:32,258
So, I mean, that's, I understand your concerns.

775
01:11:32,278 --> 01:11:35,059
You have some legitimate concerns and I think that they can be addressed.

776
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:36,119
Thank you.

777
01:11:36,139 --> 01:11:37,680
Well, they, they can't be massive.

778
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:38,080
We can't.

779
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:47,824
Well, Mr. President, if I could, they can't be, they can't be addressed if we're going to use a grant that in perpetuity, uh, says the land can only be used for a particular use.

780
01:11:48,364 --> 01:11:50,485
So that doesn't address my particular concerns.

781
01:11:51,327 --> 01:11:57,409
Um, and, um, so that, that, for that reason, I will not support this tonight, Mr. President.

782
01:11:57,789 --> 01:11:58,169
Thank you.

783
01:11:58,489 --> 01:12:01,070
And, uh, I, I do believe this is a worthy project.

784
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:05,891
It's one that I brought up, uh, like I said, a year and a half ago, Mr. President.

785
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:07,992
And I do believe it's a worthy project.

786
01:12:08,252 --> 01:12:08,632
Thank you.

787
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:09,112
Thank you.

788
01:12:09,152 --> 01:12:11,033
Counselor Marks on the seat paper.

789
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:13,394
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

790
01:12:14,474 --> 01:12:17,515
The seat paper is for council Lungo Kern.

791
01:12:18,273 --> 01:12:20,373
It is, oh, I'd love to, Councilor.

792
01:12:20,734 --> 01:12:45,039
The C paper is that the funding of the police station mechanisms be explained to the City Council by the Mayor and that further, that the $250,000 be paid back into the bond immediately upon receipt, which will happen at the completion of the project.

793
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:46,179
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

794
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:49,503
We're in the motions counselor.

795
01:12:49,523 --> 01:12:52,647
You've had time for your comments the role counselor.

796
01:12:53,027 --> 01:12:53,327
Thank you.

797
01:12:53,347 --> 01:12:53,928
Mr. President.

798
01:12:54,549 --> 01:12:55,290
It's council rules.

799
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:55,951
Mr. President's

800
01:12:57,117 --> 01:13:16,010
Mr. President, it was a couple of weeks ago that we had the police department out here before us, and the Patrolman Association President, Harold McGilvery, spoke before this council asking for the need for not only the woman's locker room, but also for a new station, Mr. President.

801
01:13:16,551 --> 01:13:18,412
And this council voted unanimously, 7-0.

802
01:13:20,273 --> 01:13:22,874
to meet with the mayor regarding the police station.

803
01:13:23,254 --> 01:13:35,118
Now it's what, three weeks later, we haven't set up a meeting, Mr. President, and we're putting out requests that we get bits and pieces of information from the administration regarding what's happening with the police department.

804
01:13:35,918 --> 01:13:37,998
So I don't know where we stand, Mr. President.

805
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:40,359
Where do we stand on it?

806
01:13:40,379 --> 01:13:41,620
Are we gonna meet with the mayor?

807
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,760
The mayor's getting back to us.

808
01:13:46,361 --> 01:13:46,821
Thank you.

809
01:13:46,861 --> 01:13:47,901
The mayor's getting back to us.

810
01:13:48,001 --> 01:13:48,302
Thank you.

811
01:13:48,862 --> 01:13:49,642
Thank you, counselor.

812
01:13:50,076 --> 01:13:51,497
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

813
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:53,518
Yes.

814
01:13:57,861 --> 01:13:58,162
Yes.

815
01:13:59,443 --> 01:14:00,143
Councilor Falco?

816
01:14:00,243 --> 01:14:00,443
Yes.

817
01:14:00,984 --> 01:14:01,544
Councilor Night?

818
01:14:01,644 --> 01:14:01,924
Yes.

819
01:14:02,445 --> 01:14:03,385
Vice-President Long and Kern?

820
01:14:03,425 --> 01:14:03,525
Yes.

821
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:04,946
Councilor Marks?

822
01:14:05,187 --> 01:14:05,387
Yes.

823
01:14:06,087 --> 01:14:06,868
Councilor Scott Pele?

824
01:14:06,988 --> 01:14:07,248
Yes.

825
01:14:07,728 --> 01:14:08,549
President Del Rosso?

826
01:14:08,729 --> 01:14:08,929
No.

827
01:14:09,169 --> 01:14:12,372
The vote is six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

828
01:14:12,752 --> 01:14:13,693
The motion passes.

829
01:14:14,133 --> 01:14:18,476
The B paper offered by Councilor Marks that the, uh,

830
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:26,021
money of the amount of $250,000 rather than bonding be taken from free cash.

831
01:14:26,601 --> 01:14:28,983
On that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

832
01:14:29,023 --> 01:14:29,824
Madam Vice President.

833
01:14:29,844 --> 01:14:30,144
Thank you.

834
01:14:30,164 --> 01:14:40,053
Sorry, Mr. President, just through the chair to Misty Lorenzo, do you have any bonds coming forward besides this one in the next six months that you're aware of?

835
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:46,625
Okay.

836
01:14:46,665 --> 01:14:46,945
Thank you.

837
01:14:47,025 --> 01:14:58,934
I mean, I think that's one thing we have to make clear to the administration, whether it's this bond or the next one, you know, maybe this is the last bond we're going to support before the police station, but obviously we need four or five strong to be able to do that.

838
01:14:59,334 --> 01:15:00,195
Just a suggestion.

839
01:15:00,235 --> 01:15:09,341
But I think that's something we need to send a message that if we keep bonding and we're never going to be able to bond whatever we need for the police stations, just not going to happen.

840
01:15:09,382 --> 01:15:12,744
We need to take some bonds off the books to be able to afford the 20 million.

841
01:15:13,004 --> 01:15:14,625
And we need to make that statement loud and clear.

842
01:15:15,146 --> 01:15:15,466
Thank you.

843
01:15:16,119 --> 01:15:18,721
On the BPAPER motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

844
01:15:20,022 --> 01:15:20,822
Councilor Caviello?

845
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:21,083
No.

846
01:15:21,923 --> 01:15:22,644
Councilor Falco?

847
01:15:22,704 --> 01:15:22,864
No.

848
01:15:23,544 --> 01:15:24,065
Councilor Knight?

849
01:15:24,285 --> 01:15:24,465
No.

850
01:15:25,005 --> 01:15:25,826
Vice-President Long and Kern?

851
01:15:25,866 --> 01:15:25,926
No.

852
01:15:27,687 --> 01:15:28,288
Councilor Mox?

853
01:15:28,488 --> 01:15:28,708
Yes.

854
01:15:29,288 --> 01:15:30,089
Councilor Scarpelli?

855
01:15:30,249 --> 01:15:30,489
No.

856
01:15:31,090 --> 01:15:31,890
President DelaRusso?

857
01:15:32,251 --> 01:15:32,451
No.

858
01:15:32,891 --> 01:15:36,994
With the vote of six in the negative, one in the affirmative, the motion fails.

859
01:15:37,754 --> 01:15:44,079
Now on the main motion before us, offered for approval by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Knight.

860
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:45,540
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

861
01:15:46,719 --> 01:16:07,128
Mr. Counselor Marks, if we could get that motion, if we can get a report back from the administration regarding the, uh, maintenance plan, uh, Mr. President, the, uh, director of, uh, community development has made that clear to us that that is a priority for her to develop.

862
01:16:19,805 --> 01:16:20,845
Do you want that as a D paper?

863
01:16:21,526 --> 01:16:23,546
Oh, if it's a priority, then what do we need a paper for?

864
01:16:24,367 --> 01:16:24,667
All right.

865
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:26,007
Thank you.

866
01:16:26,607 --> 01:16:26,867
Please.

867
01:16:27,488 --> 01:16:28,068
Very good point.

868
01:16:28,088 --> 01:16:28,488

I'm Brian Dugdale from Goulston and Storrs, 400 Lane Avenue in Boston, here with my colleague John Tuig, and this is Paul Sincotta from New England Development.

900
01:18:47,154 --> 01:18:47,495
Thank you.

901
01:18:47,895 --> 01:18:48,816
Are you in favor of this?

902
01:18:49,436 --> 01:18:50,077
We are in favor.

903
01:18:50,317 --> 01:18:54,140
We're here on behalf of the owner of the Meadow Glen Mall, Medford Associates LLC.

904
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:54,940
Thank you.

905
01:18:55,461 --> 01:18:56,582
Anybody else in favor?

906
01:18:57,182 --> 01:18:58,363
Anybody else in favor?

907
01:18:58,823 --> 01:19:01,385
Hearing and seeing none, we declare that portion of the meeting closed.

908
01:19:02,106 --> 01:19:07,090
Anybody in opposition to this measure, please present yourself to the rail and state your name and address for the record.

909
01:19:10,735 --> 01:19:11,616
Are you in opposition?

910
01:19:12,076 --> 01:19:13,176
Yes, I'm in opposition.

911
01:19:13,357 --> 01:19:14,497
Your name and address for the record.

912
01:19:14,737 --> 01:19:17,979
Marie Mazzio, 6 Cudworth Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

913
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:18,780
Thank you, Marie.

914
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,401
Anybody else in opposition?

915
01:19:24,483 --> 01:19:29,786
Hi, my name is Elaine Nazaro, 38 Bradley Road in Medford, and I am in opposition.

916
01:19:29,926 --> 01:19:30,827
Thank you very much.

917
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:32,828
Anybody else in opposition?

918
01:19:33,248 --> 01:19:40,352
Hearing and seeing none, I declare that portion closed and recognize Councilor Knight, Chairman of Licensing.

919
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:47,822
And Mr. Zoning and we asked the petitioner to come up and tell us about their project.

920
01:19:47,862 --> 01:19:54,124
How you doing, sir?

921
01:19:54,204 --> 01:19:55,045
Thank you for coming this evening.

922
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:55,705
Thank you very much.

923
01:19:56,005 --> 01:19:56,385
Thank you.

924
01:19:56,425 --> 01:20:00,266
Um, in looking at your application, it appears that the paperwork's in order.

925
01:20:00,326 --> 01:20:04,648
It looks like, um, what you're petitioning for is to open up a commercial,

926
01:20:05,713 --> 01:20:09,475
business in an industrial sector, uh, an industrially zoned sector.

927
01:20:09,515 --> 01:20:12,856
It's looks like it's about a 20,000 square foot facility.

928
01:20:13,276 --> 01:20:16,638
Um, looks like you're requesting hours of operation from 9am to 9pm.

929
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:20,439
Maybe you guys can just go from there and kind of fill us in a little bit as to what it is you're trying to do over there.

930
01:20:21,219 --> 01:20:21,460
Sure.

931
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:21,800
Thanks.

932
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:22,440
Thanks very much.

933
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,141
Uh, counseling counselor.

934
01:20:24,161 --> 01:20:25,461
And, uh, thanks for your time here tonight.

935
01:20:26,041 --> 01:20:34,585
Um, we have a tenant coming in Petco, which is a general pet store, uh, general retailer, uh, to be clear that we, we,

936
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:35,840
are here tonight.

937
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:40,421
We, after we had the tenant approach us, uh, we met with commissioner Moki.

938
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:45,822
We've been in touch with commissioner Moki in connection with an ongoing redevelopment of the, of the metal Glen mall.

939
01:20:46,962 --> 01:20:51,783
Um, the metal Glen mall for those familiar with it, we've got a Coles at one end and a Marshall's at the other end.

940
01:20:52,003 --> 01:20:55,564
And the interior space, what had been the interior mall space is being renovated.

941
01:20:56,244 --> 01:21:02,605
One of those spaces, which about 20,000 square feet would be occupied by, uh, this retail tenant Petco.

942
01:21:03,185 --> 01:21:04,025
Uh, we, when,

943
01:21:04,357 --> 01:21:05,698
We spoke with Commissioner Moki.

944
01:21:05,838 --> 01:21:10,080
We went through the proposed use and looked at the history of the Meadow Glen Mall.

945
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,742
There had previously been a pet store located at the Meadow Glen Mall.

946
01:21:13,322 --> 01:21:16,223
And this is a technical requirement that we're seeking to fill here.

947
01:21:17,104 --> 01:21:21,106
To be clear, there's no overnight boarding of dogs or cats or anything of that nature.

948
01:21:21,146 --> 01:21:28,690
We're only talking about small animals, things of the nature of fish, small birds, small mammals, things of that nature.

949
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:31,392
No overnight boarding of any dogs or cats whatsoever.

950
01:21:31,972 --> 01:21:33,533
I want to make that just clear for the record.

951
01:21:35,388 --> 01:21:48,257
Um, as a pet store, um, can you explain to us whether or not you fall under the local control about border health or, um, as a pet store like this, uh, governed more by state regulation and state code?

952
01:21:49,458 --> 01:21:50,579
It's governed by both actually.

953
01:21:50,619 --> 01:21:53,421
So there'll be licensing at both the state and, and the local level.

954
01:21:54,041 --> 01:22:03,648
Uh, one of the requirements or the special permit, which, uh, we'd submit that we meet will the, the actual pet store operator will have to comply with all local board of health regulations.

955
01:22:04,463 --> 01:22:11,029
In addition, they'll have to be approved and licensed and approved on an annual basis with annual inspections by the Department of Agriculture.

956
01:22:11,049 --> 01:22:15,313
Okay.

957
01:22:15,793 --> 01:22:19,737
And how many full-time jobs are going to come with the approval of this facility?

958
01:22:21,618 --> 01:22:23,320
Paul Sincotta with New England Development.

959
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:28,144
They'd be about 25 or 30 full and part-time jobs.

960
01:22:30,372 --> 01:22:34,113
And can you tell me what an average annual salary is for someone that works in a Petco?

961
01:22:34,133 --> 01:22:35,153
I mean, are we talking that?

962
01:22:35,173 --> 01:22:39,994
It doesn't seem like this is a facility where people are going to be able to make a living wage and still reside in our community.

963
01:22:40,834 --> 01:22:42,474
We have an industrially zoned property.

964
01:22:43,174 --> 01:22:44,995
We're trying to change the use to a commercial use.

965
01:22:45,535 --> 01:22:48,795
And we have, I mean, quite frankly, if you look at there, it's a large parcel of land.

966
01:22:48,855 --> 01:22:50,876
We have coals on one end, marshals on the other.

967
01:22:51,196 --> 01:22:52,316
We're putting in a supermarket.

968
01:22:52,376 --> 01:22:53,536
Now we're going to put in a pet store.

969
01:22:53,836 --> 01:22:59,217
I don't think there's any jobs in that entire facility other than the manager of the supermarket that's going to get paid more than minimum wage.

970
01:23:02,393 --> 01:23:03,894
I think that we would disagree.

971
01:23:03,914 --> 01:23:17,477
Wegmans, the supermarket operator themselves, stands out as one of the more outstanding employers across the supermarket industry, certainly in terms of wages and benefits.

972
01:23:19,758 --> 01:23:28,940
The retail jobs within the center are at least consistent with the retail jobs that have been there historically.

973
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:36,966
All of these companies do provide benefits, and we think that they are consistent with what's been there in the past.

974
01:23:38,167 --> 01:23:41,490
So this employer does provide health benefits to its full-time workers?

975
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:44,692
Yes, to both, I believe, yes.

976
01:23:54,281 --> 01:23:55,462
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

977
01:24:00,313 --> 01:24:02,834
Can you just explain a little bit more in detail?

978
01:24:02,854 --> 01:24:05,396
You said no overnight boarding of dogs and cats.

979
01:24:05,877 --> 01:24:09,779
So does that mean there will be no sale of dogs and cats as well?

980
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:12,141
That's correct.

981
01:24:12,321 --> 01:24:17,585
Petco has an adoption first store, so there will be no sales of dogs or cats whatsoever.

982
01:24:17,605 --> 01:24:21,327
And there will be no adoptions through actually located at the store.

983
01:24:21,908 --> 01:24:25,050
Typically what Petco does is they partner with local shelters to try to work

984
01:24:25,795 --> 01:24:34,957
to try to bring potential pets that could be adopted to potential pet owners, make that connection, but there will be no sales whatsoever at this store in terms of dogs and cats.

985
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:35,837
Great.

986
01:24:35,877 --> 01:24:42,678
We have an organization in Medford that works for pet adoption, so hopefully we can connect the two.

987
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:52,800
Just briefly, some of the other services that Petco will offer

988
01:24:53,471 --> 01:25:05,136
They will offer grooming services, vet services, vet services that provide vaccinations, flea and tick screening, and those types of services that are on an appointment basis.

989
01:25:05,656 --> 01:25:12,418
But again, as Brian indicated, there's no boarding that's made in connection with those veterinary services.

990
01:25:18,081 --> 01:25:18,781
Thank you, Mr. President.

991
01:25:18,801 --> 01:25:20,942
A quick question about the grooming services and whatnot.

992
01:25:22,713 --> 01:25:34,359
Are those going to be during the same business hours nine to nine or is grooming stop at a certain time or I'm fairly certain that they occur throughout the entire operating hours.

993
01:25:34,599 --> 01:25:34,799
OK.

994
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:42,964
The vet services I do know do not vet services are a little bit shorter than their normal retail operating hours.

995
01:25:43,364 --> 01:25:43,584
OK.

996
01:25:43,864 --> 01:25:44,184
Thank you.

997
01:25:48,146 --> 01:25:48,907
Madam Vice President.

998
01:25:48,927 --> 01:25:49,107
Sorry.

999
01:25:49,127 --> 01:25:49,887
Thank you for the chair.

1000
01:25:49,947 --> 01:25:51,008
I'm just.

1001
01:25:52,032 --> 01:26:00,039
where the Petco and Woburn, they don't sell dogs or cats, but they do board them overnight, almost like a daycare.

1002
01:26:00,119 --> 01:26:03,723
Will there be any type of daycare in this Petco, day or night?

1003
01:26:04,343 --> 01:26:04,784
They will not.

1004
01:26:05,124 --> 01:26:06,345
So no daycare whatsoever?

1005
01:26:06,405 --> 01:26:06,726
Correct.

1006
01:26:06,946 --> 01:26:12,471
They will offer training services, but there will be no overnight boarding.

1007
01:26:13,792 --> 01:26:15,053
And no daytime daycare?

1008
01:26:15,093 --> 01:26:16,555
I'm sorry, and no daytime.

1009
01:26:18,725 --> 01:26:26,632
So it'll just be grooming of dogs and cats, dogs, I'm assuming, and the sale of, what's the largest animal you'll be selling?

1010
01:26:27,193 --> 01:26:28,374
A guinea pig at times?

1011
01:26:29,134 --> 01:26:30,936
Guinea pigs, they don't even get quite to rabbits.

1012
01:26:31,837 --> 01:26:36,861
There are rules within Massachusetts that actually limit the size.

1013
01:26:37,542 --> 01:26:40,104
It's really classified as a beginner or an intermediate pet.

1014
01:26:40,865 --> 01:26:43,727
Birds, fish, small reptiles.

1015
01:26:44,797 --> 01:26:46,618
Are you with the mall developer?

1016
01:26:46,958 --> 01:26:48,078
I'm with New England Development, yes.

1017
01:26:48,098 --> 01:26:49,218
We're the owner and the redeveloper.

1018
01:26:49,238 --> 01:26:52,199
What is the construction they're going to end with?

1019
01:26:52,259 --> 01:26:54,120
There's another big retailer going in there.

1020
01:26:54,680 --> 01:27:04,523
So the lineup starting on the Coles end would be Coles, Wegmans, Dick's Sporting Goods, the Petco store, and then on the far left, the existing Marshalls.

1021
01:27:05,003 --> 01:27:05,984
Thank you.

1022
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:08,004
We're hoping for a fall of 17 open.

1023
01:27:08,064 --> 01:27:08,204
Madam?

1024
01:27:10,877 --> 01:27:13,900
you here tonight, can you say that again?

1025
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:14,420
Fall 2017.

1026
01:27:14,841 --> 01:27:15,141
Fall of 17.

1027
01:27:15,742 --> 01:27:17,363
Fall of 17, for everything.

1028
01:27:17,924 --> 01:27:18,264
Correct.

1029
01:27:18,384 --> 01:27:19,185
Okay, thank you.

1030
01:27:20,766 --> 01:27:23,289
I know there were some citizens that wanted to speak on the matter.

1031
01:27:23,309 --> 01:27:26,572
You're welcome to come up and state your name and address for the record.

1032
01:27:31,476 --> 01:27:35,400
My name is Marie Mazzio, 6 Cudworth Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1033
01:27:36,189 --> 01:27:44,593
And I'm here making sure that what we don't want to see is cats and dogs being sold in a pet store.

1034
01:27:44,693 --> 01:27:46,434
We definitely don't want that.

1035
01:27:47,014 --> 01:27:57,759
I know that in the city of Medfit with grants that we have gotten in working with Pat Hogan, that Medfit really has come up a long way on

1036
01:27:58,735 --> 01:28:12,459
spaying and neutering and we've really have brought down the number of cats that we have gotten telephone calls in the past of stray kittens and abandoned animals.

1037
01:28:12,799 --> 01:28:21,122
They're still out there but we certainly, there are too many animals being put down every day and we don't want to see people breeding like

1038
01:28:22,623 --> 01:28:34,553
puppy mills just to sell dogs and encouraging people to have their cats reproduced so that they can make $10 or whatever selling pets to a pet store.

1039
01:28:34,613 --> 01:28:50,286
So we are familiar with Petco, Kitty Connection, the organization that I founded does network with Petco and WUBEN and as long as there's no dogs, cats, or animals being exploited for sale,

1040
01:28:50,926 --> 01:28:54,949
Um, I don't see there being any, any problem with the pet go.

1041
01:28:56,490 --> 01:28:56,910
Thank you.

1042
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:02,354
Anybody else?

1043
01:29:02,474 --> 01:29:03,894
Thank you all share.

1044
01:29:03,975 --> 01:29:07,737
Wait, some ocean council marks.

1045
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:17,223
Just if I could, I want to personally thank Marina lane for their advocacy on, uh, for, uh, animals in this community.

1046
01:29:18,127 --> 01:29:20,888
And they've been working at it a long time, Mr. President.

1047
01:29:21,488 --> 01:29:31,671
And you're absolutely correct, Marie, that they've made a lot of headway in this community to make sure that, you know, the pets that we do have in the community are safe.

1048
01:29:32,471 --> 01:29:40,114
And if there are any pets that are on the streets, that they too are sought after and put in a home.

1049
01:29:40,574 --> 01:29:43,155
So I want to thank them for their work.

1050
01:29:43,535 --> 01:29:44,995
It's a tough line of business.

1051
01:29:45,535 --> 01:29:46,716
Seven days a week, 24 hours a day.

1052
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:54,414
That phone rings, and I want to thank them both for their work on behalf of pets in this community, Mr. President.

1053
01:29:54,995 --> 01:29:55,775
Thank you, Counselor.

1054
01:29:57,417 --> 01:29:58,257
Madam Vice President.

1055
01:29:58,457 --> 01:29:59,978
Briefly, thank you, President DelaRusso.

1056
01:30:00,018 --> 01:30:01,399
I just want to echo the sentiments.

1057
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:04,121
I think Marie explained how far Medford has come.

1058
01:30:05,302 --> 01:30:14,788
Obviously, we have Pat Hogan, who works really hard, but the majority of the reason why Medford has come so far is from Kitty Connection, and all the work Marie does.

1059
01:30:16,220 --> 01:30:18,722
going into homes and rescuing all the cats.

1060
01:30:19,762 --> 01:30:28,068
I've heard the stories and the work she does on a day-in, day-out basis with her team is something that we need to be very thankful for.

1061
01:30:28,448 --> 01:30:32,051
And I hope while we do have the two parties, maybe we can exchange some business cards.

1062
01:30:32,111 --> 01:30:34,112
It would be great if Petco would work with Marie.

1063
01:30:34,632 --> 01:30:37,434
She works very close with Pat Hogan from City Hall.

1064
01:30:37,855 --> 01:30:41,337
I know you have the truck, the mobile truck that spays and neuters.

1065
01:30:41,397 --> 01:30:43,638
So hopefully we can create a good bond tonight.

1066
01:30:43,659 --> 01:30:44,139
That would be great.

1067
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:48,912
President Emeritus Mayako is your biggest fan.

1068
01:30:51,234 --> 01:30:52,075
Chair awaits motion.

1069
01:30:52,235 --> 01:30:52,796
Motion to accept.

1070
01:30:53,316 --> 01:31:00,363
Motion for approval by Councillor Scott Pelley, seconded by Councillor Caviello.

1071
01:31:00,383 --> 01:31:02,144
It's to be recorded in opposition, Mr. President.

1072
01:31:02,544 --> 01:31:04,806
Councillor Knight wishes to be recorded in opposition.

1073
01:31:05,687 --> 01:31:06,588
All those in favour?

1074
01:31:06,808 --> 01:31:06,948
Aye.

1075
01:31:07,329 --> 01:31:08,330
All those opposed?

1076
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:09,090
Aye.

1077
01:31:11,092 --> 01:31:11,612
In favour?

1078
01:31:13,604 --> 01:31:16,946
On the motion for Councilor Caviello for suspension of the rules.

1079
01:31:17,186 --> 01:31:24,049
If we could take 16-801 for licensing.

1080
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:31,073
On the motion for Councilor Caviello that paper number 16-801 be taken.

1081
01:31:31,113 --> 01:31:31,833
All those in favor?

1082
01:31:31,933 --> 01:31:31,993
Aye.

1083
01:31:32,233 --> 01:31:32,954
All those opposed?

1084
01:31:33,394 --> 01:31:34,134
Motion granted.

1085
01:31:34,154 --> 01:31:42,038
16-801 petition for a class 2 auto dealers license by Tiago Messidiano of 30 Chelsea Street.

1086
01:31:42,651 --> 01:31:49,813
Department Number 810, Everett, Massachusetts, for Inman Motor Corp, 357 Mystic Avenue, Medford.

1087
01:31:50,453 --> 01:32:04,218
On file, business certificate, building department papers, approvals from fire, police, health, bonding, treasurer, letter of compliance, tax ID, workman's comp, petition, and corporate papers.

1088
01:32:04,618 --> 01:32:09,680
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello, Chairman of our licensing.

1089
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:10,840
Thank you, Mr. President.

1090
01:32:11,882 --> 01:32:15,964
Mr. President, if the gentleman would give us a little detail.

1091
01:32:16,024 --> 01:32:19,486
It looks like you have a lot of paperwork here, and I've reviewed them.

1092
01:32:19,646 --> 01:32:23,208
If you can give us a little overview of your project, what you want to do.

1093
01:32:23,228 --> 01:32:24,489
Please state your name and address for the record.

1094
01:32:25,570 --> 01:32:33,294
My name is Anselmo Silveira, Jr., and I'm one of the owners with Tiago Mauriciano of Inman Motors.

1095
01:32:35,233 --> 01:32:45,641
Basically, what we're looking to do, I don't know if you are familiar with former Harley-Davidson motorcycle dealer in Everett.

1096
01:32:46,261 --> 01:32:48,143
We took over that about two years ago.

1097
01:32:48,923 --> 01:32:52,546
And current now, we have EMA Motors over there in Everett.

1098
01:32:54,170 --> 01:32:57,091
being serving the community for the past two years, it's been perfect.

1099
01:32:57,751 --> 01:33:03,133
Before, Imam Mothers is in the market for about 13 years.

1100
01:33:03,713 --> 01:33:12,696
Before, we had two stores in Somerville that when we moved to Everett and we opened a big store, we closed those two stores.

1101
01:33:13,937 --> 01:33:22,100
What we're looking to do is exactly like we're doing in Everett, we sell between

1102
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:27,061
three to almost new cars, like with very few miles.

1103
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:34,383
And the store in Everett currently has now about 170, 180 cars.

1104
01:33:35,083 --> 01:33:40,924
And we are applying for a license for 157 cars on this current location in Medford.

1105
01:33:41,584 --> 01:33:48,386
Will be basically the same operation, will be the same deal as we're doing in Everett right now.

1106
01:33:50,026 --> 01:33:51,647
Are you planning on keeping the store in Everett also?

1107
01:33:53,210 --> 01:33:53,830
Okay.

1108
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:55,712
And like I said, I've, I've seen your reference store.

1109
01:33:55,732 --> 01:33:59,514
It's a, it's a very clean store and your property always seems to be well maintained there.

1110
01:33:59,994 --> 01:34:05,058
And I would hope that you would maintain, um, uh, the same, uh, uh, standard of that.

1111
01:34:05,498 --> 01:34:09,020
Um, I was a little concerned about if you had the capacity for 157 cars there.

1112
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:09,460
Uh, yes, we, um,

1113
01:34:12,572 --> 01:34:14,253
Are you taking over the whole thing?

1114
01:34:14,614 --> 01:34:16,916
The whole thing, the front and the back, yes.

1115
01:34:16,976 --> 01:34:18,237
Is Grava moving out of there?

1116
01:34:18,317 --> 01:34:19,358
Grava is moving, yes.

1117
01:34:19,598 --> 01:34:20,239
Okay.

1118
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:24,342
We actually have the plan for everything here.

1119
01:34:24,883 --> 01:34:26,664
I have a few copies if you want to take a look.

1120
01:34:26,884 --> 01:34:27,685
I have the plan.

1121
01:34:28,126 --> 01:34:30,928
I wasn't sure if Grava was moving out of there.

1122
01:34:31,028 --> 01:34:34,211
I'm a little more comfortable now with that, but now that I know Grava won't be in back there.

1123
01:34:34,471 --> 01:34:37,913
We comply with the measurement for each car and everything.

1124
01:34:38,013 --> 01:34:40,514
So I think we are fine.

1125
01:34:40,734 --> 01:34:43,615
I mean, that's why if you need more copies, we have here.

1126
01:34:43,635 --> 01:34:46,396
Do you plan on doing any renovations to that property?

1127
01:34:46,416 --> 01:34:46,876
Yes, we do.

1128
01:34:47,157 --> 01:34:47,377
Yes.

1129
01:34:47,697 --> 01:34:50,278
Before we move it in, it will take about three months to move it in.

1130
01:34:50,698 --> 01:34:52,879
We're going to do like we did in Everett.

1131
01:34:52,919 --> 01:34:54,940
We're going to renovate the whole building.

1132
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,261
We're going to do inside, outside.

1133
01:34:57,281 --> 01:34:58,982
We're going to do the lines on the asphalt.

1134
01:35:00,368 --> 01:35:03,611
exactly like it looks in Everett, it's going to look imaginable.

1135
01:35:03,631 --> 01:35:08,775
Like I say, I've seen your store in Everett, and from the outside, it looks very nice, the property.

1136
01:35:08,795 --> 01:35:13,499
Every time I go by, it's always well-maintained, and I would hope that you do the same here.

1137
01:35:14,119 --> 01:35:19,804
Mr. President, I've reviewed the papers, and they appear to be in order, and I motion for approval.

1138
01:35:20,164 --> 01:35:25,228
On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Night, chair recognizes Councilor Scott Pelli.

1139
01:35:25,569 --> 01:35:29,612
If I can, I'd just like to share the reputation that you have.

1140
01:35:30,149 --> 01:35:31,370
and those local communities.

1141
01:35:31,570 --> 01:35:53,239
I know that, um, working in Somerville and what Inman auto sales has done in both Everett and Somerville, um, and giving back to your community, being part of that community, not just being an auto dealer, but, but really being part of that community and, and supporting youth organizations and being, being positive to our, our community and growth.

1142
01:35:53,319 --> 01:35:56,881
So, um, I'm excited about this, this partnership.

1143
01:35:56,941 --> 01:35:59,402
I think that, uh, I hope that when, uh,

1144
01:35:59,910 --> 01:36:08,798
when it's time that the Inman is there to help our community as much as you're out helping the communities in Somerville, Everton, what you're doing for them.

1145
01:36:08,878 --> 01:36:13,562
So thank you for all the work you do there, and hopefully we welcome you to Medford.

1146
01:36:14,382 --> 01:36:15,143
Thank you very much.

1147
01:36:15,223 --> 01:36:20,368
And it will be a pleasure to do whatever we did in the other communities.

1148
01:36:20,388 --> 01:36:22,009
It will be a pleasure to do here.

1149
01:36:22,349 --> 01:36:23,510
We like to be part of it.

1150
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:26,713
So you can come with us with anything you guys need.

1151
01:36:27,053 --> 01:36:27,314
Thank you.

1152
01:36:29,225 --> 01:36:31,986
On the motion for approval, last seconded.

1153
01:36:32,086 --> 01:36:33,527
One last question, Mr. Chairman.

1154
01:36:33,927 --> 01:36:35,327
Are you buying the property or are you leasing it?

1155
01:36:35,868 --> 01:36:36,508
We're leasing it.

1156
01:36:36,548 --> 01:36:39,689
We have five years with option for another five years.

1157
01:36:40,309 --> 01:36:42,890
And we have the option to buy as well.

1158
01:36:42,930 --> 01:36:44,491
We are the first one in line to buy it.

1159
01:36:45,331 --> 01:36:47,192
If he wants to sell it, it would be a pleasure.

1160
01:36:47,332 --> 01:36:47,632
Thank you.

1161
01:36:48,772 --> 01:36:49,593
Congratulations.

1162
01:36:49,833 --> 01:36:50,433
Thank you very much.

1163
01:36:50,453 --> 01:36:50,833
All those in favor?

1164
01:36:50,913 --> 01:36:51,694
All those opposed?

1165
01:36:52,234 --> 01:36:52,974
The ayes have it.

1166
01:36:53,154 --> 01:36:54,074
Congratulations.

1167
01:36:54,334 --> 01:36:54,815
Thank you very much.

1168
01:36:54,875 --> 01:36:58,176
On the motion for council tonight for suspension of the rules to take the paper off the table.

1169
01:36:58,912 --> 01:36:59,672
All those in favor.

1170
01:36:59,692 --> 01:37:00,453
All those opposed.

1171
01:37:00,493 --> 01:37:03,354
Mr. Counselor, 16 deck seven 79.

1172
01:37:03,955 --> 01:37:04,675
Am I correct?

1173
01:37:05,315 --> 01:37:05,896
Thank you.

1174
01:37:05,916 --> 01:37:13,800
Uh, is off the table national grid and Verizon at Boston Avenue conduit underground chair recognizes counselor night.

1175
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,861
Uh, Mr. President, thank you very much.

1176
01:37:16,061 --> 01:37:24,325
Uh, this paper came up last week and it was tabled, um, at the request of council Scott Pelley and myself, um, based upon the historic,

1177
01:37:25,527 --> 01:37:30,009
negligence that National Grid and their contractors has given to our public roadways, Mr. President.

1178
01:37:31,289 --> 01:37:52,316
Ultimately, there was a permit that was before us, and I picked up the phone and spoke with National Grid last week, and I explained to them the reasoning for my vote and the reasoning for not supporting the permit, at which time the individuals from National Grid explained to me that what they were doing was pulling a permit for the developer, and the developer was going to be performing the work.

1179
01:37:54,057 --> 01:37:55,337
They put me in touch with the developer.

1180
01:37:56,125 --> 01:38:01,249
I had an opportunity to speak with the developer and Mr. Shea is here this evening as well as his project manager.

1181
01:38:02,530 --> 01:38:12,357
And they explained to me that this proposal came forward as part of a redevelopment proposal with the location at 630 Boston Avenue.

1182
01:38:13,873 --> 01:38:25,240
This is a project that's gone through the variance process at the Zoning Board of Appeals and is a move from a taxi cab stand to some residential rental units here in the community, Mr. President.

1183
01:38:27,161 --> 01:38:42,890
Earlier in the year, it's my understanding that public utility came in and replaced all the underground utilities for water sewer from the roadway in Somerville, which would be called Broadway, along Boston Ave, Medford Stretch to Harvard.

1184
01:38:43,919 --> 01:38:47,140
So that whole entire underground utility has been replaced.

1185
01:38:47,200 --> 01:38:55,843
And it's also my understanding, Mr. President, that come the spring, that entire stretch of the roadway is going to be repaved from curb to curb for the entire length.

1186
01:38:56,064 --> 01:39:03,626
So it's very important that we take a look at this permit and allow these individuals to go and do the work that they do.

1187
01:39:04,407 --> 01:39:13,070
Because if we do not, and they come back at a later date, Mr. President, we will have a road that was just recently paved, brand new curb to curb from the Somerville line to Harvard Street.

1188
01:39:13,692 --> 01:39:17,996
that is now going to need to be cut up and dug up and patched.

1189
01:39:19,117 --> 01:39:32,688
And, um, I think that, um, I'm very glad that I had the opportunity to speak with, um, Mr. Shea and, um, Mr. Klein, the two people that are working on this development here, as well as the gentlemen that appeared before us last week to clarify some of the questions that I have, Mr. President.

1190
01:39:33,168 --> 01:39:37,372
But, um, it's my understanding that Commonwealth contracting will be resurfacing Boston Avenue.

1191
01:39:37,812 --> 01:39:39,914
Um, they're looking to start that work in the spring.

1192
01:39:40,697 --> 01:39:46,479
And, um, my questions and concerns relative to whether or not the public contractor is going to be accountable have been answered.

1193
01:39:46,919 --> 01:39:55,263
Um, the developers have agreed to stay in contact with me and provide me with a monthly update, um, a look ahead as to what's going to happen down there in a monthly update, Mr. President.

1194
01:39:55,303 --> 01:40:04,646
So, um, with that being said, I'd move to take the matter off the table and move for approval based upon the fact that, um, the concerns and questions that I raised that held the paper up have been addressed.

1195
01:40:04,666 --> 01:40:07,367
Um, I can't speak for my colleague, councilor Scott Pelly.

1196
01:40:09,188 --> 01:40:09,528
Thank you.

1197
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:14,222
On the motion for approval, chair recognizes counselor Scott Pelley.

1198
01:40:14,623 --> 01:40:23,288
I, uh, to be redundant, I won't bore everybody with such an eloquent statement from my colleague, but, uh, I too talked to Mr. Shea, Mr. Klein.

1199
01:40:23,308 --> 01:40:35,615
I think that, uh, uh, talking to, to national grid, um, uh, the message has been sent and, um, my, my, my, uh, address to them is that this will,

1200
01:40:36,163 --> 01:40:52,030
at least with this councilor, every time project comes forth, um, I will, um, table it until, um, we see some action and what they've done and past and past work and make sure that we have their commitment moving forward.

1201
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:59,493
So I too support, uh, moving this forward and, uh, uh, wishing Mr. Shea, uh, good luck.

1202
01:41:00,293 --> 01:41:05,015
Good luck, Mr. Shea on the motion for removal by council and I seconded by councilor, uh,

1203
01:41:05,586 --> 01:41:07,887
uh, Scott Pelley chair recognizes council night again.

1204
01:41:08,147 --> 01:41:30,095
Um, I also, Mr. President, I think it's very important to point out that the reason for the, um, tabling of the matter wasn't because of opposition to the development, but more or less it was opposition to the work and national grids doing in our community and the followup that we're doing on the city side to make sure that they comply with city standards and restore our streets to the condition that they deserve to be restored.

1205
01:41:30,155 --> 01:41:30,355
And so,

1206
01:41:30,697 --> 01:41:33,139
I mean, it had nothing to do with the project or the scope thereof.

1207
01:41:33,159 --> 01:41:40,143
Mr. President, it was more or less the relationship between our public contractors in the city here and what we need to do to have them do a better job.

1208
01:41:40,623 --> 01:41:40,964
Thank you.

1209
01:41:41,024 --> 01:41:42,705
Councilor Marks is now recognized.

1210
01:41:43,605 --> 01:41:44,526
Thank you, Mr. President.

1211
01:41:45,687 --> 01:41:55,533
During that meeting, I also believe we asked for a list for the last three years of all street openings and any permits that have been pulled.

1212
01:41:56,073 --> 01:42:00,156
And also to see what the follow up was from the city.

1213
01:42:00,822 --> 01:42:06,185
And I think what we're going to find, Mr. President, is a lack of oversight on behalf of this city.

1214
01:42:06,625 --> 01:42:11,207
So I don't fault the different contractors.

1215
01:42:11,647 --> 01:42:14,749
I don't fault the different utility companies.

1216
01:42:15,309 --> 01:42:20,272
I fault the city, because the city is there to safeguard us as a community, Mr. President.

1217
01:42:20,892 --> 01:42:29,236
And they are the ones that should be held their feet to the fire to make sure that when these utility companies do come into the community, that they put back

1218
01:42:30,029 --> 01:42:34,671
uh, the road in the same condition or better condition than they found it.

1219
01:42:35,211 --> 01:42:38,872
And that sign off and check and balance is not currently taking place.

1220
01:42:38,932 --> 01:42:53,716
So I asked Mr. President once again that we received the report that this council voted unanimously on for, I believe it was the last three years of a street opening permits and any follow up by this city on those permits.

1221
01:42:53,736 --> 01:42:56,017
Mr. President, now that this paper is on,

1222
01:42:56,654 --> 01:43:01,975
off the table and coming towards some action.

1223
01:43:02,955 --> 01:43:11,477
Once that action is taken, the amendments will be sent out to the appropriate people, and I'm sure we will quickly receive our responses.

1224
01:43:11,797 --> 01:43:15,157
So on the motion approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1225
01:43:15,457 --> 01:43:16,277
All those in favor?

1226
01:43:16,297 --> 01:43:16,638
Aye.

1227
01:43:16,938 --> 01:43:17,718
All those opposed?

1228
01:43:17,738 --> 01:43:20,718
Guys have it, congratulations, the motion is passed.

1229
01:43:23,879 --> 01:43:24,659
Do we have a motion?

1230
01:43:27,364 --> 01:43:29,426
The motion to return to regular order of business.

1231
01:43:29,506 --> 01:43:30,226
All those in favor?

1232
01:43:30,246 --> 01:43:30,987
All those opposed?

1233
01:43:31,607 --> 01:43:35,370
Motion granted 16-799 offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

1234
01:43:36,031 --> 01:43:45,857
Be it resolved that the City Administration share any information they might have with the City Council in regards to the Langwood Commons development site.

1235
01:43:46,538 --> 01:43:53,703
Whereas the development being discussed in this location will result in negative quality of life issues for the residents of Medford,

1236
01:43:54,182 --> 01:43:56,584
but more so for the residents in North Medford.

1237
01:43:57,044 --> 01:44:03,249
Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Peli and Councilor, where is this being offered for development?

1238
01:44:04,190 --> 01:44:05,931
It's the hospital site.

1239
01:44:06,331 --> 01:44:06,431
Oh.

1240
01:44:06,832 --> 01:44:22,624
And I think that with our ad hoc committee, that's been working very hard with trying to figure out the Malden site and what's happening there and thanking our traffic supervisors, the police department and Sergeant Hottnett and Brooks that

1241
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:42,074
um, doing performing that study and now finding that, um, it looks like that development at Lang Langwood has now passed its final hurdle with, uh, the fells, um, petitions that now they're going to start, uh, uh, moving forward with their development.

1242
01:44:42,154 --> 01:44:48,616
So with what's going on, what's going on in that area and the fear and, uh, what's going to happen,

1243
01:44:49,238 --> 01:44:59,788
with traffic and congestion is, is, um, something we need to make sure that we act, um, a more aggressive manner with our city administration.

1244
01:44:59,828 --> 01:45:12,761
So I'd ask the mayor to, um, to, to reach out if we can, uh, have the mayor reach out to, um, uh, every, every and any department we need to, to see where we stand with this project.

1245
01:45:13,455 --> 01:45:17,158
and what effects it's going to have, uh, in our neighborhoods.

1246
01:45:17,818 --> 01:45:24,423
Um, it's, it's just when we talk about the Malden site, the Malden hospital site, it takes you back.

1247
01:45:24,703 --> 01:45:39,754
And, um, now with this piling on it, uh, the development that's being proposed in those areas are frightening to our quality of life and Medford and especially, like I said, um, North Medford.

1248
01:45:40,074 --> 01:45:40,975
So thank you.

1249
01:45:41,362 --> 01:45:43,963
Thank you on that motion chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

1250
01:45:44,163 --> 01:45:45,183
Thank you, Mr. President.

1251
01:45:45,363 --> 01:45:48,063
Also thank you to Councilor Scott Pelley for bringing this forward tonight.

1252
01:45:48,704 --> 01:45:55,065
Um, this is definitely a quality of life issue that is going to impact North Medford and Fulton Heights.

1253
01:45:55,825 --> 01:46:07,627
Uh, like a Councilor Scott Pelley said him, uh, Councilor Longo and myself have been working diligently on the, uh, Malvern hospital ad hoc subcommittee on, uh, the issues, uh, surrounding the Malvern hospital.

1254
01:46:07,687 --> 01:46:09,348
This is very similar in nature.

1255
01:46:09,368 --> 01:46:09,408
Um,

1256
01:46:10,657 --> 01:46:11,758
It's an impact on quality of life.

1257
01:46:11,798 --> 01:46:13,939
The traffic is going to be out of control.

1258
01:46:15,280 --> 01:46:26,986
We're already talking about hundreds of additional trips from Malden Hospital, potentially, and you're talking about, I mean, many, many more than that, I believe, up at the old New England Memorial site in Stoneham.

1259
01:46:27,767 --> 01:46:31,609
So this is a major concern, a major quality of life issue.

1260
01:46:33,310 --> 01:46:37,492
So far, with regard to the research that we've done in the Malden Hospital,

1261
01:46:38,899 --> 01:46:43,800
had Sergeant Hartnett and Officer Brooks go out and do traffic counts on Murray Hill Road.

1262
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,741
We'll be getting that report soon.

1263
01:46:46,201 --> 01:46:58,524
So what I'd like to do is if Councilor Scarpelli wouldn't mind, I'd like to amend the resolution that we get traffic counts on Highland Avenue, Elm Street, and on Fulton Street in the interest of public safety.

1264
01:46:59,064 --> 01:47:02,005
We need to be proactive with regard to this issue.

1265
01:47:03,365 --> 01:47:07,166
Like Councilor Scarpelli said, this is a major quality of life issue.

1266
01:47:07,691 --> 01:47:08,791
We need to be out in front of this.

1267
01:47:09,531 --> 01:47:13,492
And in talking to Sergeant Hartnett, we cannot get traffic counts.

1268
01:47:14,353 --> 01:47:16,853
We're not gonna be able to get them soon because of the weather.

1269
01:47:17,053 --> 01:47:20,934
I guess the traffic counting machine doesn't work well in inclement weather and in the winter.

1270
01:47:20,954 --> 01:47:24,635
So probably in the spring, we will be able to get those counts.

1271
01:47:24,695 --> 01:47:32,797
But I'd like to amend the resolution that we get traffic counts on Highland Ave, Elm Street and Fulton Street in the interest of public safety.

1272
01:47:32,817 --> 01:47:33,517
So thank you.

1273
01:47:33,537 --> 01:47:36,998
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Falco,

1274
01:47:37,442 --> 01:47:39,642
Chair recognizes Councilor Carviello.

1275
01:47:40,223 --> 01:47:40,963
Thank you, Mr. President.

1276
01:47:40,983 --> 01:47:53,365
Mr. President, I'd also like to ask that we bring in the DCR into this because the DCR is, uh, I was involved in this project a couple of years ago and I know there's going to be a lot of roadway changes up there.

1277
01:47:54,225 --> 01:47:57,006
Uh, so we can see what roadway changes are going to be made.

1278
01:47:57,826 --> 01:48:05,267
Uh, especially I've heard talk of the rotary being taken out, uh, and the, and widening of some of the, that, that historic roadway.

1279
01:48:06,002 --> 01:48:16,607
Uh, so if we could, uh, maybe get them in to give us a report, uh, on what's going to be happening with the roadway and with all that parkland up there, uh, and the impact that's going to have on that.

1280
01:48:17,768 --> 01:48:18,128
Very good.

1281
01:48:18,568 --> 01:48:24,811
So on the motion of council Scott Pelley, as amended by council Falco and council caveo chair recognizes councilor night.

1282
01:48:25,131 --> 01:48:32,094
Um, Mr. President, I'd like to further amend the paper and request that we reach out to the friends of the fells as well and ask if they can provide us with any data that they have.

1283
01:48:32,134 --> 01:48:33,695
I know the friends of the fells were, um,

1284
01:48:34,272 --> 01:48:40,336
spearheading the effort to combat the development there at this location, um, because of the impact that it would have on the ecosystem.

1285
01:48:40,697 --> 01:48:43,399
So I think that they may have a lot of that traffic data and stuff.

1286
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:46,401
It might be a little bit outdated, but it might be a spot for us to start off with.

1287
01:48:47,201 --> 01:48:52,045
And further amended by Councilor Knight on that motion as amended.

1288
01:48:52,065 --> 01:48:54,827
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1289
01:48:56,508 --> 01:48:57,308
Thank you, Mr. President.

1290
01:48:57,329 --> 01:48:59,450
I want to thank Councilor Scott Kelly for offering this.

1291
01:49:00,050 --> 01:49:02,132
Uh, this is a major, major issue.

1292
01:49:02,807 --> 01:49:04,388
uh, for the North Meffitt Heights area.

1293
01:49:05,029 --> 01:49:10,972
And in addition to, uh, which I think is a worthy, uh, additional study, uh, for the traffic volume.

1294
01:49:10,992 --> 01:49:22,280
Uh, I would also like to see Mr. President, uh, a study be done by DCR regarding a pedestrian crossing and pedestrian safety, uh, along Fulton street and along Elm, Mr. President.

1295
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:30,465
Uh, I just read somewhere, uh, online that the city of Malden sat at the table with DCR and they're in the process of doing

1296
01:49:31,595 --> 01:49:40,557
hundreds of thousands of dollars in renovation to a rotary in Malden, with the likelihood of DCR picking up the entire tab.

1297
01:49:41,237 --> 01:49:45,638
And it surrounds vehicular safety as well as pedestrian safety.

1298
01:49:46,018 --> 01:50:00,661
So I don't think it's a lot to ask, Mr. President, that we ask for these particular reports and also get feedback from DCR on the potential to additional traffic, which we already know Elm Street

1299
01:50:01,074 --> 01:50:07,216
is a major cut through into the city of Meffitt and our neighborhoods.

1300
01:50:11,057 --> 01:50:18,219
On the motion for approval by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilors Falco, Caviello, Knight, and Marx.

1301
01:50:18,319 --> 01:50:19,279
All those in favor?

1302
01:50:19,699 --> 01:50:19,779
Aye.

1303
01:50:19,859 --> 01:50:20,659
All those opposed?

1304
01:50:21,420 --> 01:50:22,140
The ayes have it.

1305
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:25,401
The motion passes 16-800.

1306
01:50:27,581 --> 01:50:29,902
Offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved

1307
01:50:30,407 --> 01:50:37,909
that the city arborist send the city council report on what type of trees are being planted on city property.

1308
01:50:38,490 --> 01:50:46,652
Whereas the trees that have been previously planted are beginning to raise newer sidewalks causing dangerous surfaces.

1309
01:50:47,113 --> 01:50:48,473
Counselor Scarpelli.

1310
01:50:48,973 --> 01:50:50,014
Thank you, Mr. President.

1311
01:50:50,054 --> 01:50:57,376
Again, I received a few phone calls both from, uh, uh, neighbors, um, on, uh, not only just,

1312
01:50:58,007 --> 01:51:10,631
in my, my neighborhood in North Memphis, North Memphis, but also in, uh, other, uh, neighborhoods that, uh, had their streets and sidewalks done over the last 10 to 15 years.

1313
01:51:10,771 --> 01:51:25,456
And what they're, what we're seeing is the type of trees that were planted at the time, um, were at the time, uh, those residents that accepted those trees and were told that there, they weren't going to be the same type of rooting trees.

1314
01:51:26,047 --> 01:51:32,310
that as the trees grow, the roots then raise the sidewalks and, uh, traverse into homes.

1315
01:51:32,431 --> 01:51:35,072
Unfortunately, we're seeing that that's not the case.

1316
01:51:35,412 --> 01:51:45,798
And, uh, relatively newer streets and sidewalks and our residential areas are now popping up and causing a very dangerous, uh, and hazardous situation.

1317
01:51:46,298 --> 01:51:49,120
So there's nothing we can do about that.

1318
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:54,823
But as we move forward, um, I'm hoping we can make, uh, make the motion that, uh, we, we,

1319
01:51:55,672 --> 01:52:14,604
meet with the city arborist to make sure that as they're preparing to purchase their new trees in the spring and what they'll be proposing for new construction road work that we're using the proper trees that will not affect the sidewalks and the roads in such a negative manner.

1320
01:52:14,944 --> 01:52:20,008
We'll also be talking about this process again in the next 10 years.

1321
01:52:20,848 --> 01:52:24,731
I also, if we can, as I was traveling talking to different

1322
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:26,620
uh, constituents.

1323
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:29,581
One of the questions came about is where we also stand.

1324
01:52:29,981 --> 01:52:33,801
Um, we can amend that is where we stand as tree city USA.

1325
01:52:34,201 --> 01:52:38,902
And as we're losing trees, how we're replacing them and, uh, throughout our community.

1326
01:52:38,962 --> 01:52:41,303
So thank you for the opportunity this evening.

1327
01:52:42,023 --> 01:52:51,324
Uh, the motion of council Scott Pelly as amended to, uh, uh, figure out where we stand to make ourselves a tree city USA again.

1328
01:52:52,385 --> 01:52:52,785
Thank you.

1329
01:52:53,185 --> 01:52:53,365
Sure.

1330
01:52:53,385 --> 01:52:54,805
Recognize this council Falco.

1331
01:52:55,144 --> 01:52:56,324
Thank you, Mr. President.

1332
01:52:56,504 --> 01:52:59,545
Once again, I thank council Scott Pelly for bringing this forward.

1333
01:53:00,145 --> 01:53:01,025
It's an important issue.

1334
01:53:01,285 --> 01:53:14,127
Um, but I'd like to also, uh, if we could amend the resolution further, I know during the past year we've talked a lot as a, uh, as a committee about stumps, trees and, uh, sidewalks.

1335
01:53:14,167 --> 01:53:22,389
And if we could get a report back from, uh, the DPW with regard to how many sidewalks have been replaced this year, how many trees have been planted,

1336
01:53:22,977 --> 01:53:24,598
and how many stumps had been removed.

1337
01:53:24,878 --> 01:53:27,120
So in the calendar year of 2016?

1338
01:53:27,180 --> 01:53:28,701
You are correct, year to date, please.

1339
01:53:29,261 --> 01:53:33,264
Year to date report as amended by Councilor Falco.

1340
01:53:35,046 --> 01:53:39,249
On the motion for approval by Councilor Scott Pelley, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1341
01:53:39,289 --> 01:53:40,069
All those in favor?

1342
01:53:40,089 --> 01:53:40,850
Aye.

1343
01:53:40,930 --> 01:53:43,391
Opposed?

1344
01:53:43,471 --> 01:53:44,552
Carried 16-805.

1345
01:53:46,514 --> 01:53:47,875
Offered by Councilor Knight.

1346
01:53:49,336 --> 01:53:52,638
Whereas Massachusetts Municipal Association

1347
01:53:53,079 --> 01:53:58,503
has established a fiscal policy committee to establish a series of best practice recommendations.

1348
01:53:58,743 --> 01:54:11,874
And whereas adequate funding of municipal reserve accounts to mitigate budget risks from extraordinary and unforeseen events and maintain fiscal stability over time has been deemed a best practice.

1349
01:54:12,634 --> 01:54:21,461
And whereas it is widely recognized that those local governments who have established and funded reserve and stabilization accounts at sufficient levels

1350
01:54:21,865 --> 01:54:34,468
have been well served because these reserves allow localities to sustain services in times of economic and fiscal distress and limit the risk from extraordinary and unforeseen occurrences.

1351
01:54:34,649 --> 01:54:47,512
And whereas sound policies and practices, along with adequate levels of reserves, can also have positive impact on credit ratings and reduce the cost of borrowing and capital project spending.

1352
01:54:48,072 --> 01:54:50,753
And whereas the DOI's Division of Local Services

1353
01:54:51,270 --> 01:55:05,358
advises that a good reserve policy will establish target balances for the local stabilization fund and other reserves and will establish a schedule of annual appropriations designed to reach target balances gradually over time.

1354
01:55:05,478 --> 01:55:18,566
And whereas the government finance offices associations executive board recommends local governments establish a formal policy on the level of unrestricted fund balance that should be maintained in the general fund.

1355
01:55:19,033 --> 01:55:38,188
at a suggested level of no less than two months of general operating fund revenues or expenditures, and that various parts of the fund balance be specified, each of them, for the purpose of working capital, budget stabilization, and responding to extreme events.

1356
01:55:39,229 --> 01:55:43,572
Be it therefore resolved that the Medford City Council request the city's administration

1357
01:55:44,043 --> 01:55:54,893
to establish a reserve stabilization account and policy for the use or drawing down off reserves and for the replenishment thereof.

1358
01:55:55,093 --> 01:55:55,834
Councillor Knight.

1359
01:55:56,354 --> 01:55:57,896
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1360
01:55:58,376 --> 01:56:07,945
Um, last term, the city council, um, by way of resolution, uh, brought forward by Councillor Camuso voted to establish a stabilization account and, uh,

1361
01:56:08,440 --> 01:56:21,348
At the time Governor Baker was just elected and there was some discussion about whether or not stabilization accounts were going to become a mandatory practice across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at the municipal level because it's been deemed the best practice, Mr. President.

1362
01:56:21,388 --> 01:56:26,671
So we here in the city of Medford do have a stabilization account, but after my conversations with Ms.

1363
01:56:26,711 --> 01:56:37,297
Nunley last week, it appears that there is no money in our stabilization account, nor is there a policy to take money out of a stabilization account or a policy to replenish our stabilization account.

1364
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:44,744
So I think that it's about time, Mr. President, that we ask the administration to take a look at establishing a stabilization account.

1365
01:56:44,965 --> 01:56:57,795
Now, the Government Finance Office's Association's Executive Board does recommend that a formal policy be established and that an unrestricted fund level be maintained that should be no less than two months of operating revenue, Mr. President.

1366
01:56:57,855 --> 01:57:06,942
Now, if we take a look at the fiscal year's budget that we're in right now, we're looking at a $162 million budget, and two months of operating expenses thereof would be

1367
01:57:07,645 --> 01:57:14,893
The equivalent of $13.66 million that right now would be deemed a best practice to be set aside into a reserve account, Mr. President.

1368
01:57:15,634 --> 01:57:24,383
So I'd like the administration to establish a policy as to what functions and purposes that these funds can be used for.

1369
01:57:25,145 --> 01:57:45,929
to set a target as to how much funds are going to be appropriated annually, and then we can begin to establish a real rainy day fund or a real reserve account, Mr. President, so that we run into situations like the police station, it's a catastrophic event, we're in a better position to deal with it.

1370
01:57:51,309 --> 01:57:53,130
I just have questions with regards to

1371
01:57:55,461 --> 01:57:57,803
how we're going to fund 13.66 million a million.

1372
01:57:57,843 --> 01:58:05,329
I'm going to take some money out of free cash or are we going to, how, how are we going to, you know, do it?

1373
01:58:06,490 --> 01:58:10,733
Um, I have questions with regards to this resolution.

1374
01:58:10,773 --> 01:58:13,715
I don't feel comfortable voting for it tonight until maybe a prop.

1375
01:58:14,055 --> 01:58:15,216
We understood it more.

1376
01:58:16,637 --> 01:58:17,918
We have 10 million in free cash.

1377
01:58:17,938 --> 01:58:20,921
We have reserves in our water and sewer enterprise account.

1378
01:58:20,961 --> 01:58:24,884
We have reserves from rate payers for the cable franchise fee.

1379
01:58:25,458 --> 01:58:28,840
Now we want to establish another $13.66 million.

1380
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:38,805
I just don't see how we're going to be able to do that unless we were going to take from, you know, whatever certified free cash we have at the end of the year and put it into it.

1381
01:58:39,465 --> 01:58:48,650
Is the recommendation to put a portion of that into the reserve fund so that in years down the road we can eventually create a point where we're comfortable?

1382
01:58:48,790 --> 01:58:52,832
Are we looking to, you know, continue to tax or Proposition 2.5?

1383
01:58:53,172 --> 01:58:54,093
What's the proposal?

1384
01:58:54,961 --> 01:58:57,982
So if Councillor Knight can respond to that.

1385
01:58:58,082 --> 01:59:09,385
The proposal is to establish a policy to begin to fund our stabilization account as well as a policy to initiate withdrawals thereof and mandate replenishment thereof.

1386
01:59:13,987 --> 01:59:17,128
I think we would just need a meeting on it before we actually vote it.

1387
01:59:17,188 --> 01:59:18,768
I mean, I'm not in agreement.

1388
01:59:18,788 --> 01:59:23,210
I just can't see where the $13 million would come from and I

1389
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:25,900
It can be built up over time.

1390
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:37,105
Kind of set guidelines ourself and say, Madam Mayor, this is what we're proposing rather than, I don't know if my council colleagues have any other questions.

1391
01:59:37,125 --> 01:59:40,566
We have a motion for approval, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

1392
01:59:41,587 --> 01:59:43,187
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

1393
01:59:43,467 --> 01:59:51,651
Mr. President, if we could refer this to the Auditing, Finance and Budget Taxation Subcommittee, maybe discuss this before we vote on it this evening.

1394
01:59:52,699 --> 01:59:57,044
Maybe everyone else will feel a little more comfortable knowing where we're going to get the $13 million.

1395
01:59:57,104 --> 01:59:58,927
I think that's a pretty

1396
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:10,282
a large sum of money to come up with out of, you know- Point of information, Mr. President.

1397
02:00:10,582 --> 02:00:23,769
Point of information, Counselor, and I- $13.6 million is based upon the recommendation that's made by the government finance offices associations executive board that recommends that the formal policy that's established should set aside two months worth of general operating funds.

1398
02:00:23,889 --> 02:00:25,330
It doesn't have to be the end all, be all.

1399
02:00:25,610 --> 02:00:29,332
That's just what the standard that's recommended by the professionals that are in the industry, Mr. President.

1400
02:00:29,910 --> 02:00:37,695
Um, I certainly have no problem with the paper going to subcommittee if the subcommittee is going to meet and vet it, but we just set the tax rate tonight and that subcommittee hasn't met since as long as I've been on the council.

1401
02:00:38,175 --> 02:00:42,558
So, you know, although I have no problem with the paper going to subcommittee provided work is going to be done there.

1402
02:00:42,858 --> 02:00:49,101
I think that this is something, Mr. President, we're asking the administration to put a policy in place because last council, we asked them to create an account.

1403
02:00:49,181 --> 02:00:49,922
They created an account.

1404
02:00:50,482 --> 02:00:52,363
The account has zero dollars and zero cents in it.

1405
02:00:52,924 --> 02:00:55,205
So if we're asking them to create a stabilization account,

1406
02:00:55,680 --> 02:01:02,823
for the purpose of providing us with reserves in the municipal bank account so that we can deal with catastrophic events, but don't put any money in it.

1407
02:01:03,043 --> 02:01:04,224
I don't, I don't think it makes sense.

1408
02:01:04,364 --> 02:01:11,467
So I have no problem sending the paper to the audit and finance and taxation subcommittee, provided that it meets council coffee.

1409
02:01:11,567 --> 02:01:11,987
I'm sorry.

1410
02:01:12,287 --> 02:01:13,368
Thank you.

1411
02:01:13,828 --> 02:01:22,432
I think when we, we would, when we talked with the consultant last week when he was here, he said that, you know, we were the money that we had, he thought was, um,

1412
02:01:23,476 --> 02:01:27,099
not great, but compared to other cities, we were in fairly decent shape.

1413
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:37,487
To take that and to single it out for one particular purpose right now without any discussion, I think

1414
02:01:38,258 --> 02:01:41,559
It wouldn't be prudent enough, so let's say- Point of clarification, Mr. President.

1415
02:01:41,639 --> 02:01:44,519
Either through a council- Point of clarification, Mr. President.

1416
02:01:44,860 --> 02:01:49,301
I'm not looking for $13.6 million to get transferred from one account to the other tomorrow by the mayor.

1417
02:01:49,881 --> 02:01:56,242
I'm asking for the mayor to develop a policy and a procedure so that we can define the level of funding that we want.

1418
02:01:56,302 --> 02:01:59,243
It could be one month, it could be a half a year, it could be two months, it could be two bucks.

1419
02:02:00,063 --> 02:02:03,104
But we have to have some sort of policy in place if we're gonna have a stabilization fund.

1420
02:02:03,444 --> 02:02:05,024
We have a stabilization fund, we have no policy.

1421
02:02:05,544 --> 02:02:07,585
Motion for approval on the floor.

1422
02:02:09,522 --> 02:02:16,785
Council Caviello would like you to go to a council of the whole or to the subcommittee for a little discussion before we vote on this.

1423
02:02:18,586 --> 02:02:20,407
We have a motion for approval first.

1424
02:02:21,087 --> 02:02:22,888
So do we take that as a deep breaker?

1425
02:02:23,408 --> 02:02:25,109
Chair recognizes councilor Falco.

1426
02:02:26,009 --> 02:02:26,989
I think it's a good resolution.

1427
02:02:27,009 --> 02:02:28,830
I think it makes fiscal sense.

1428
02:02:29,250 --> 02:02:31,391
I think it, I think it's a good resolution.

1429
02:02:31,431 --> 02:02:33,712
I think it makes good fiscal sense.

1430
02:02:33,832 --> 02:02:35,113
And I have, um,

1431
02:02:35,577 --> 02:02:46,286
I have no problem with it going to subcommittee, but I think it would be nice to actually get a draft policy first that would come to subcommittee and then we can discuss it because then we'll have something to work with.

1432
02:02:46,827 --> 02:02:52,672
So I'd like to, I'd like to see a draft, you know, Paul, I think if we pass this, have it, or maybe it's amended.

1433
02:02:52,692 --> 02:02:57,936
So it's a draft policy that comes to us with a plan and then we can meet in subcommittee.

1434
02:02:58,477 --> 02:03:02,000
And I mean, I've, uh, you know, I've only been on the board for years, years.

1435
02:03:02,060 --> 02:03:02,500
So, um,

1436
02:03:02,934 --> 02:03:12,102
I'm on this subcommittee and, you know, I'd be more than happy to take a look at it with my, I believe Councilor Carviello and Councilor Marks around this.

1437
02:03:13,764 --> 02:03:19,829
Myself, other thing is Councilor Falco, Councilor Marks, myself, and that's it.

1438
02:03:20,009 --> 02:03:21,110
That's it, so it's the three of us.

1439
02:03:21,130 --> 02:03:22,211
Councilor Marks was on here twice.

1440
02:03:23,893 --> 02:03:24,814
He's got two votes.

1441
02:03:24,874 --> 02:03:27,096
He's got two votes.

1442
02:03:27,116 --> 02:03:28,737
So, I think it,

1443
02:03:30,382 --> 02:03:43,907
So Mr. President, I think it makes sense to actually move this to subcommittee, but I think it would make more sense to have a draft policy come to us with the administration, how they would like to handle it, and what they would like the policy to be.

1444
02:03:44,327 --> 02:03:48,949
We can review it and vet it, and at that point make a decision, OK, do we want changes to this?

1445
02:03:48,969 --> 02:03:49,889
Does this make sense?

1446
02:03:50,450 --> 02:03:51,870
Or is it something we can live with?

1447
02:03:52,210 --> 02:03:53,951
Or maybe it's not.

1448
02:03:54,051 --> 02:03:56,052
But I think that we need to have something to work with.

1449
02:03:57,772 --> 02:03:59,693
We need to get something from the administration first.

1450
02:04:04,599 --> 02:04:05,540
Thank you, Mr. President.

1451
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:15,366
Uh, it's, it's not, uh, under the purview of this council to create policy that's done by, uh, the executive branch.

1452
02:04:16,126 --> 02:04:22,370
And if the mayor chooses to create a policy around that, which I agree with council on that, I think it's a great suggestion.

1453
02:04:22,968 --> 02:04:24,269
and I think it should be looked at.

1454
02:04:24,289 --> 02:04:34,854
I prefer, I'd rather send the paper to the mayor asking whether the mayor thinks this is a good idea, whether this would be a policy she would need to create.

1455
02:04:35,235 --> 02:04:40,097
Maybe the mayor, I mean the mayor's a CPA, maybe the mayor in her wisdom doesn't see a need for it.

1456
02:04:40,597 --> 02:04:46,300
So I don't see why we as a council should spin our wheels on something that's an administrative function.

1457
02:04:47,041 --> 02:04:51,303
And if the mayor sees fit, the mayor sends us notes all the time, I support.

1458
02:04:51,626 --> 02:04:53,488
This resolution, I support that resolution.

1459
02:04:54,008 --> 02:05:07,561
I didn't see it with this one, but, uh, you know, maybe we should ask the mayor if she's in support and would you like creating a policy, madam mayor, rather than, you know, a legislative body that doesn't create policy, uh, dictate Mr. President.

1460
02:05:07,581 --> 02:05:12,205
It doesn't make any sense to me, but I, but I think it's a worthy idea.

1461
02:05:12,225 --> 02:05:14,087
I think having a policy is a worthy idea.

1462
02:05:16,309 --> 02:05:17,670
And thank you all counselors.

1463
02:05:18,261 --> 02:05:20,943
So I can straighten out this.

1464
02:05:21,663 --> 02:05:25,867
We have a motion for approval and we have a motion for it to go to committee.

1465
02:05:27,788 --> 02:05:29,209
And a motion to send to the mayor.

1466
02:05:30,430 --> 02:05:35,453
So you're going to change your motion?

1467
02:05:35,493 --> 02:05:39,316
You withdraw your motion.

1468
02:05:47,972 --> 02:05:48,972
Councillor Caviello.

1469
02:05:57,817 --> 02:06:06,401
Which was Councillor Falco's that the paper be sent to the mayor for rumination and opinion on that motion.

1470
02:06:07,161 --> 02:06:08,102
All those in favour?

1471
02:06:08,902 --> 02:06:09,742
All those opposed?

1472
02:06:10,563 --> 02:06:11,423
The ayes have it.

1473
02:06:16,018 --> 02:06:17,378
Councillor Marks, what did you say?

1474
02:06:27,261 --> 02:06:28,941
I assumed that they were both the same.

1475
02:06:28,981 --> 02:06:29,721
My apologies.

1476
02:06:30,061 --> 02:06:31,602
So that was the motion of Councillor Marks.

1477
02:06:31,642 --> 02:06:34,162
Mr. Clerk, let the record show it and stand corrected.

1478
02:06:34,182 --> 02:06:34,642
Yes.

1479
02:06:40,882 --> 02:06:50,570
16-802 petition by councillor Jean Martin, 10 Cummings Street, Medford Mass, to address the council on police staffing.

1480
02:06:50,610 --> 02:06:50,790
Ms.

1481
02:06:50,830 --> 02:06:55,294
Martin, you know you've addressed that to us on within 90 days.

1482
02:06:58,118 --> 02:06:58,538
What's that now?

1483
02:06:59,359 --> 02:07:00,779
Oh, okay.

1484
02:07:00,839 --> 02:07:01,780
First of all, thank you very much.

1485
02:07:02,520 --> 02:07:03,721
Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1486
02:07:04,401 --> 02:07:05,141
Police staffing.

1487
02:07:05,782 --> 02:07:10,184
I have a solution that will both satisfy police staffing shortages and black equity.

1488
02:07:10,804 --> 02:07:16,927
However, this policy needs to be carried out to the letter of my recommendation or it will fail as an integration tool.

1489
02:07:17,667 --> 02:07:26,432
My point is not to diminish other racial groups, but the slightest dilution waters down the real intent behind this initiative and the black man will once again be left behind.

1490
02:07:27,572 --> 02:07:30,373
We currently have 107 police officers and we need 130.

1491
02:07:30,913 --> 02:07:36,754
I propose we develop a policy whereby 10% of the police department constitute black men.

1492
02:07:37,494 --> 02:07:44,495
Of the 10% black males hired, at least 7% of them must be veterans of military service.

1493
02:07:45,395 --> 02:07:53,017
If we require a supermajority of the 10% to be black veterans, there will be less resistance from the veterans groups who also have a valid complaint.

1494
02:07:53,877 --> 02:07:58,321
Since the goal is 130, then 13 will be black men, and of that, nine must be black male veterans.

1495
02:08:01,912 --> 02:08:04,894
leaving the general population to account for the other four black men.

1496
02:08:05,975 --> 02:08:14,141
I will discuss women in a minute, but there can be absolutely no substitution, not even a two-for-one black woman veteran.

1497
02:08:14,881 --> 02:08:23,427
Black men are a unique subset of society, and if our goal is to obtain racial justice for the black men, then no substitution can water it down.

1498
02:08:24,068 --> 02:08:30,913
Black men need role models on the street through the police department, and I dare say that white people also need to see black men in blue.

1499
02:08:32,095 --> 02:08:35,817
This is a hard reality, but needs to be said.

1500
02:08:36,217 --> 02:08:42,661
There's a difference between the atrocities we have committed on black males and the general discrimination other races have gone through.

1501
02:08:43,542 --> 02:08:50,446
The first requires active steps by our government to correct a past harm, and the latter only equal treatment, not corrective action.

1502
02:08:51,066 --> 02:08:52,307
Awareness, yes.

1503
02:08:52,767 --> 02:08:53,368
Extra steps, no.

1504
02:08:55,959 --> 02:08:59,061
This distinction must be understood and accepted by all of Medford.

1505
02:08:59,601 --> 02:09:02,162
Otherwise this plan to integrate the city will fail.

1506
02:09:02,963 --> 02:09:13,368
Yes even Hispanics cannot be accepted as a black minority unless of course he or she is black is he is a black Hispanic not because he is Hispanic but because he is black.

1507
02:09:14,028 --> 02:09:17,150
If we include Hispanics we start to go down the rabbit hole.

1508
02:09:17,850 --> 02:09:20,652
The policy will fail to address the number one racial objective.

1509
02:09:21,838 --> 02:09:23,700
So what if you're a Hispanic veteran?

1510
02:09:24,241 --> 02:09:31,849
You are placed under the general population outside of the black category, and I will personally advocate that you succeed over a non-veteran white nation.

1511
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:42,021
police officers are selected through the civil service hiring process.

1512
02:09:42,801 --> 02:09:43,382
That's correct.

1513
02:09:43,662 --> 02:09:45,602
But I do have a right to have my opinion.

1514
02:09:45,722 --> 02:09:46,763
Please continue citizen.

1515
02:09:46,923 --> 02:09:47,563
Thank you very much.

1516
02:09:47,583 --> 02:09:49,504
Okay.

1517
02:09:51,224 --> 02:09:58,167
So anyway, I will personally advocate that you succeed over a non-veteran white man or the general population because you are a veteran.

1518
02:09:58,727 --> 02:10:03,228
The math so far is 107 plus 13 equals 120 officers.

1519
02:10:03,888 --> 02:10:06,788
Now, for the other 10 officers, I would like to see women hired.

1520
02:10:07,109 --> 02:10:07,369
Why?

1521
02:10:07,829 --> 02:10:09,809
Because women bring something different to the table.

1522
02:10:10,609 --> 02:10:14,130
They should be trained exactly as their male counterparts, but they are not men.

1523
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:23,511
We need women officers for the obvious, domestic violence, rape, and to transport women detainees to higher level prisons as women do commit crime.

1524
02:10:24,692 --> 02:10:26,292
One black woman and one white woman

1525
02:10:26,679 --> 02:10:35,190
should be assigned to a racial task force for issues regarding profiling, example, that of an Arab-looking person who may be being harassed right now.

1526
02:10:36,272 --> 02:10:41,579
They can also be used as detectives in cybercrime and other investigative and intelligence roles.

1527
02:10:42,460 --> 02:10:43,722
Women have a soothing effect

1528
02:10:46,287 --> 02:10:47,989
on overjacked male testosterone.

1529
02:10:48,349 --> 02:10:50,571
And this can help in many ways on the streets.

1530
02:10:51,051 --> 02:10:54,174
But like black men, there has to be enough of them to make a difference.

1531
02:10:54,715 --> 02:10:56,597
Tokens do not give us the same result.

1532
02:10:57,177 --> 02:11:01,061
So I would recommend no less than 15% and no more than 20% female.

1533
02:11:01,861 --> 02:11:03,743
I do not want to emasculate the department.

1534
02:11:04,664 --> 02:11:07,827
Men are the majority of offenders and require equal response.

1535
02:11:13,092 --> 02:11:15,613
Women veterans should be encouraged, but not mandated.

1536
02:11:16,353 --> 02:11:17,174
Now for the mandate.

1537
02:11:17,634 --> 02:11:19,574
At least four black women must be hired.

1538
02:11:20,015 --> 02:11:20,235
Why?

1539
02:11:20,735 --> 02:11:21,915
Because black women are black.

1540
02:11:22,796 --> 02:11:26,757
She is often treated more harshly by law enforcement because she is perceived to have attitude.

1541
02:11:27,477 --> 02:11:34,320
When I was 34, I was the first woman never kicked out of the JPVA women's clinic, and they wanted to prosecute me.

1542
02:11:35,060 --> 02:11:40,162
The police chief, who looked like he was in his 50s and a veteran, paternalized me and calmed me down.

1543
02:11:40,851 --> 02:11:42,752
And he and I worked out an agreement.

1544
02:11:43,032 --> 02:11:48,394
And while I was not allowed to go back to the women's clinic and put on the terror watch list, I was not arrested.

1545
02:11:48,994 --> 02:11:54,096
I know a black woman in another VA who did the same thing that I did, but was arrested.

1546
02:11:54,856 --> 02:11:56,237
A double standard does exist.

1547
02:11:56,697 --> 02:12:00,078
And at least four black women are required for them to have a real voice.

1548
02:12:01,868 --> 02:12:05,129
This is a plan that, if not deviated from, will work.

1549
02:12:05,629 --> 02:12:13,891
My fear and warning is that should you start substituting just any black male for a black male veteran, the problems we see in society will not be alleviated.

1550
02:12:14,991 --> 02:12:20,553
If you say that we cannot do this, Gene, because it is discriminatory, I feel sorry for society.

1551
02:12:21,033 --> 02:12:26,874
Because the original intent on the anti-discrimination laws were designed to advance black men, period.

1552
02:12:27,774 --> 02:12:29,855
And everyone else has co-opted his justice.

1553
02:12:30,845 --> 02:12:33,487
Political correctness is then interfering with black justice.

1554
02:12:34,128 --> 02:12:38,451
If you really want to see racial justice for the black man, you will make this happen.

1555
02:12:39,252 --> 02:12:48,600
Even if it takes more money to seek out a black male veteran by casting a wider net the size of New England or the Eastern Seaboard, they are out there.

1556
02:12:50,462 --> 02:12:59,149
And if this is against the law, which is what Mr. Knight's indicating, then the law needs to be changed because the group that needs the most protection

1557
02:12:59,748 --> 02:13:01,430
is not protected under the current law.

1558
02:13:02,731 --> 02:13:03,272
Thank you very much.

1559
02:13:41,234 --> 02:13:41,574
Thank you.

1560
02:13:43,035 --> 02:13:47,236
And because this is the Mayor's initiative, I want to speak on it.

1561
02:13:47,556 --> 02:13:52,517
If it was just a citizen, and I do understand that it was disposed of, but if it was just a citizen.

1562
02:13:53,557 --> 02:13:55,418
Point of clarification, Councillor Knight.

1563
02:13:55,805 --> 02:14:01,089
The conversations initiative is a group of 28 community organizations that got together and started this.

1564
02:14:01,149 --> 02:14:03,391
It didn't start across the hall in the administration.

1565
02:14:03,411 --> 02:14:04,432
It didn't start at city hall.

1566
02:14:04,452 --> 02:14:06,734
It started through the community, through grassroots effort.

1567
02:14:06,854 --> 02:14:07,354
Thank you.

1568
02:14:07,514 --> 02:14:08,075
Excuse me, sir.

1569
02:14:08,495 --> 02:14:12,278
But the resolution was by the mayor, and that's the key here.

1570
02:14:12,998 --> 02:14:20,244
It's a measure that I have to speak on because it's a city document, and it's a city-sponsored document.

1571
02:14:20,764 --> 02:14:22,426
And I found out why.

1572
02:14:22,766 --> 02:14:24,948
Anyway, mayor's conversation initiative.

1573
02:14:25,973 --> 02:14:31,437
I am not in any way trying to bash the mayor, but I figured out why her conversations initiative didn't sit right with me.

1574
02:14:32,058 --> 02:14:36,621
This initiative is an official city document, and therefore I have the right to speak on it.

1575
02:14:37,482 --> 02:14:38,883
It should be rescinded and rewritten.

1576
02:14:39,584 --> 02:14:40,845
The mayor's premise is wrong.

1577
02:14:41,505 --> 02:14:50,392
The strength of our nation is not derived from our diversity, but from the strength of our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution, not from our racial and ethnic makeup.

1578
02:14:50,853 --> 02:14:52,394
How our diversity is held together

1579
02:14:52,922 --> 02:14:55,023
is through the power we continue to give the U.S.

1580
02:14:55,063 --> 02:14:56,423
Constitution by upholding it.

1581
02:14:57,203 --> 02:15:02,404
The Constitution encompasses a form of government which allows for the dissent of the minority from the majority.

1582
02:15:03,064 --> 02:15:12,227
Because of this ability, the dissent from the majority, diversity of thought and ideas can hold, can add to our majority culture.

1583
02:15:12,667 --> 02:15:22,089
And yes, tolerance of differences and ethnic groups enrich our nation as a byproduct, not as a fundamental belief, as stated by the Mayor's Conversation Initiative.

1584
02:15:23,874 --> 02:15:28,898
Our nation was not founded on the fundamental principles that all persons are entitled to equal protection under the law.

1585
02:15:29,539 --> 02:15:38,946
It was founded on heterosexual white male supremacy, who committed genocide on the original peoples because they happened to be in the way of the land the white man thought to be his rightful possession.

1586
02:15:39,827 --> 02:15:46,392
At first, our forefathers tried to enslave the Native Americans, but their spirits died under bondage, and so it was not profitable.

1587
02:15:47,352 --> 02:15:49,614
and there was indentured servitude of white peoples as well.

1588
02:15:50,234 --> 02:15:55,138
But they were often given their freedom after seven years of service, usually their most prime years of good health.

1589
02:15:56,439 --> 02:15:58,521
Do I need to then state the obvious for Africans?

1590
02:16:02,204 --> 02:16:08,809
Once the colonists who were white males of the landowning class were themselves placed in the one down position by the royal class of England.

1591
02:16:09,350 --> 02:16:15,855
Taxation without representation, they revolted and earned their freedom while still subjugating other peoples of race and gender.

1592
02:16:16,811 --> 02:16:23,317
Equal protection of the law was not earned or given to others until much later and was not codified in its founding documents.

1593
02:16:24,178 --> 02:16:24,979
The opposite is true.

1594
02:16:25,579 --> 02:16:27,921
Slavery and native subjugation was codified.

1595
02:16:29,563 --> 02:16:39,192
What is true is that it was given to the following generations whose forebears earned it through their blood, often to the death, sweat, and tears of those two specific racial categories.

1596
02:16:39,773 --> 02:16:42,295
Because they learned how to apply our founding documents,

1597
02:16:42,809 --> 02:16:46,472
to their advantage, and the Native and Black peoples were still denied after that.

1598
02:16:47,133 --> 02:16:59,083
It was not only the Bill of Rights which provided this justice to happen, but the actual process of putting forward resolutions to change the law provided for in the main body of the Constitution.

1599
02:16:59,884 --> 02:17:02,927
It is only through the continued application of the U.S.

1600
02:17:02,987 --> 02:17:06,750
law that protection for these two primary groups see any semblance of justice.

1601
02:17:07,730 --> 02:17:13,554
You cannot start a conversation on race without including the Native peoples, and the Native peoples were not immigrants.

1602
02:17:14,435 --> 02:17:22,520
Leaving the Native American experience out of the base premise is intentional, and black people did not come here as immigrants groups until much later.

1603
02:17:23,301 --> 02:17:30,346
The main focus of this resolution, while admirable in some parts of its intent, is a form of subterfuge to include illegal immigrants.

1604
02:17:30,706 --> 02:17:35,810
And that is why the non-immigrant group, known as Native American, was intentionally left out.

1605
02:17:37,065 --> 02:17:41,731
The problem with this premise is that it assumes all oppressions are equal and they are not.

1606
02:17:48,740 --> 02:17:54,327
I served under a possible five-year federal prison sentence in the Army for being a lesbian.

1607
02:17:54,778 --> 02:17:57,759
And I still knew better than to equate that with being black.

1608
02:17:58,380 --> 02:18:00,121
I used other rationales to change the law.

1609
02:18:00,641 --> 02:18:04,383
I argued that a gay man could be blackmailed and divulge military secrets.

1610
02:18:04,843 --> 02:18:10,205
I argued my own and countless other honorable discharges as proof that we have already served and with distinction.

1611
02:18:10,806 --> 02:18:14,828
I argued that it made straight women, as well as myself, more susceptible to rape.

1612
02:18:15,348 --> 02:18:18,509
And I argued that it cost the army money to train and kick me out.

1613
02:18:19,310 --> 02:18:22,191
But I never once used the black civil rights argument.

1614
02:18:22,651 --> 02:18:23,092
I knew better.

1615
02:18:24,132 --> 02:18:25,253
Not all oppressions are equal.

1616
02:18:25,813 --> 02:18:27,494
While they may overlap, they are not equal.

1617
02:18:28,455 --> 02:18:33,379
So I do believe we need to talk about race, yes, but not under this framework.

1618
02:18:33,979 --> 02:18:39,163
I agree that if you are an Arab-looking American today, we need to make sure you do not receive a backlash.

1619
02:18:39,703 --> 02:18:41,224
But this wording is not about that.

1620
02:18:41,804 --> 02:18:48,129
This wording is couched to include and protect illegal immigrants with legal immigrants, and that is not the same justice under the law.

1621
02:18:49,138 --> 02:18:52,220
If you want to talk about documenting illegals, say so openly.

1622
02:18:52,681 --> 02:18:55,983
We can talk, but not on the backs of Native and Black peoples.

1623
02:18:56,764 --> 02:19:13,817
Therefore, I believe this resolution, which is an official city government document, needs to be rescinded and rewritten to include the original peoples and African slavery as a prime example of inclusion as a result of how powerful our Constitution is, that it can fix its own structured abuses.

1624
02:19:14,660 --> 02:19:17,326
still questionable with Native Americans.

1625
02:19:17,948 --> 02:19:21,636
And then and only then, how other groups thrived off of their struggles.

1626
02:19:22,197 --> 02:19:22,498
Thank you.

1627
02:19:46,414 --> 02:20:01,578
Whereas that during the holiday season, residences tend to generate an increased amount of recyclables than usual, be it resolved that the city administration request that waste management increase recycling pickup

1628
02:20:02,049 --> 02:20:12,616
to once per week, through the second week in January, be it further resolved that the city administration advertise the Christmas tree pickup schedule as soon as reasonably possible.

1629
02:20:13,797 --> 02:20:14,358
Councilor Knight?

1630
02:20:14,958 --> 02:20:16,379
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1631
02:20:16,659 --> 02:20:17,620
I'm on trash day.

1632
02:20:18,107 --> 02:20:23,210
As you drive around the community, you'll see the blue-topped recycling bins all overflowing.

1633
02:20:24,611 --> 02:20:38,780
As the Christmas spirit comes into our homes and the holiday cheer permeates our residents and we begin to buy presents for our kids and our friends and our family, my house has turned into a bad episode of hoarders at this point.

1634
02:20:38,800 --> 02:20:40,801
I have so many boxes in my house, Mr. President.

1635
02:20:41,762 --> 02:20:44,664
And I think that others in the neighborhood are feeling the same crunch.

1636
02:20:44,964 --> 02:20:46,605
So I'd ask that the administration

1637
02:20:47,058 --> 02:21:03,626
reach out to waste management and see if there's any potential to increase the recyclable pickups to a weekly pickup between now and the week after the new year, Mr. President, so that those people that are battling the boxes and wrapping paper and so forth have an opportunity to get that stuff in the recycle bin.

1638
02:21:04,246 --> 02:21:06,187
And I also ask that when

1639
02:21:06,613 --> 02:21:22,718
They are in their discussions with waste management that they begin to publicize the Christmas tree pickup schedule as soon as reasonably possible because, uh, every year at the end of the Christmas season, we usually have a street or two that puts the Christmas trees out a day or two after the Christmas tree pickup occurred.

1640
02:21:22,798 --> 02:21:28,680
So, um, I think it would be good to get that word out there for everybody to, um, know what steps to take.

1641
02:21:29,303 --> 02:21:33,127
to get rid of some of the debris that they have, Mr. President, and when the Christmas tree pickup is going to happen.

1642
02:21:33,567 --> 02:21:34,948
On that motion, all those in favor?

1643
02:21:34,968 --> 02:21:35,589
All those opposed?

1644
02:21:35,629 --> 02:21:37,631
Motion carries.

1645
02:21:37,711 --> 02:21:41,074
Seconded by Councilor, Vice President Lungo Kern.

1646
02:21:42,335 --> 02:21:42,956
All those in favor?

1647
02:21:42,976 --> 02:21:43,036
Aye.

1648
02:21:43,476 --> 02:21:44,137
All those opposed?

1649
02:21:45,017 --> 02:21:45,458
Passes.

1650
02:21:46,159 --> 02:21:55,247
On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to take papers under suspension, offered by Councilor Scarpelli that the

1651
02:21:56,187 --> 02:22:12,542
meeting of December 27th of the City Council be canceled as it's consistent with academic calendar and supports and encourages the cohesion of families and goodwill in the season thereof.

1652
02:22:12,762 --> 02:22:13,603
All those in favor?

1653
02:22:13,963 --> 02:22:14,724
All those opposed?

1654
02:22:15,125 --> 02:22:18,808
City Council will then reconvene after that the first Tuesday of

1655
02:22:19,192 --> 02:22:23,694
January chair recognizes Counselor Scott Paladin.

1656
02:22:24,094 --> 02:22:24,735
All set, thank you.

1657
02:22:25,115 --> 02:22:25,635
You're all set?

1658
02:22:25,975 --> 02:22:26,435
Yes, sorry.

1659
02:22:27,936 --> 02:22:28,176
Was it?

1660
02:22:29,277 --> 02:22:29,917
What else did I have?

1661
02:22:32,838 --> 02:22:34,359
Is somebody needing to speak?

1662
02:22:35,159 --> 02:22:35,920
Madam Vice President?

1663
02:22:37,060 --> 02:22:37,360
I'm sorry.

1664
02:22:37,420 --> 02:22:46,784
Just briefly remind everybody and their families that the Polar Express and the Christmas activities begin at four o'clock at Metro High School on Saturday.

1665
02:22:47,325 --> 02:22:47,885
Very good.

1666
02:22:48,423 --> 02:22:50,024
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

1667
02:22:51,024 --> 02:22:52,325
Thank you, Mr. President.

1668
02:22:52,365 --> 02:22:53,065
Christmas chair.

1669
02:22:53,085 --> 02:22:53,945
Do you have for us?

1670
02:22:53,985 --> 02:22:54,425
Counselor?

1671
02:22:54,445 --> 02:22:59,567
Uh, I have, uh, some chair about inaction on behalf of the city administration.

1672
02:22:59,908 --> 02:23:00,648
Oh my heavens.

1673
02:23:02,008 --> 02:23:03,109
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1674
02:23:03,449 --> 02:23:04,289
Council, please.

1675
02:23:05,290 --> 02:23:13,653
Mr. President, if I could, two weeks ago I brought up an issue with Aflac, which is a secondary insurance.

1676
02:23:14,103 --> 02:23:16,185
that many city employees have in this community.

1677
02:23:16,445 --> 02:23:16,625
Yes.

1678
02:23:16,725 --> 02:23:27,876
And the fact that Aflac, uh, canceled employees policies due to, uh, nonpayment of, uh, the policy by on behalf of the city.

1679
02:23:28,756 --> 02:23:38,986
And, um, I asked that, uh, five questions be sent to the administration on the impact it had on city employees for the nonpayment.

1680
02:23:40,638 --> 02:23:41,798
and a number of questions.

1681
02:23:42,278 --> 02:23:56,485
And we received tonight on our desk, dated December 9th, from Anne Marie Irwin, the treasurer-collector, a letter stating more or less they didn't answer the five questions, but apparently it was a billing error that took place.

1682
02:23:58,125 --> 02:24:07,690
So for the past six or seven months, employees would cancel their AFLAC insurance because of a billing error, and they are going to

1683
02:24:08,684 --> 02:24:16,087
create a policy now, this is the city, rather than send in monthly payments, they're going to send them in weekly to AFLAC.

1684
02:24:16,187 --> 02:24:18,408
So hopefully that won't happen in the future.

1685
02:24:18,809 --> 02:24:24,131
But we still didn't receive a response, Mr. President, to the five questions that were asked.

1686
02:24:25,231 --> 02:24:28,173
And I think we still need a response from the administration.

1687
02:24:28,593 --> 02:24:35,456
I believe we received a letter, Counselor, on our desk this evening, and in the flurry of activity and votes we had,

1688
02:24:35,937 --> 02:24:42,041
I haven't had a chance to examine it, so I'm saddened to hear that it might be considered deficient.

1689
02:24:42,781 --> 02:24:56,770
It's extremely deficient, but, Mr. President, when this council votes on issues, whether you agree with the issue or not, we deserve a response from the administration, a thorough response, and not just a brush-off, Mr. President, saying there's a billing error.

1690
02:24:57,310 --> 02:24:59,271
So I'm very concerned about that.

1691
02:24:59,651 --> 02:25:00,552
Also, Mr. President,

1692
02:25:01,473 --> 02:25:11,180
Alex Ruperthal, someone that covered this community for the Meffitt Transcript as a reporter for the last, I think, maybe a year and a half, two years, three years?

1693
02:25:12,401 --> 02:25:22,827
Did tremendous work, Mr. President, on bringing up issues, enlightening the community on issues that confronted this community.

1694
02:25:23,508 --> 02:25:25,629
And he did Yeoman's work, he's moving back to

1695
02:25:27,328 --> 02:25:30,949
the windy city of Chicago, and I wish him well on all his new endeavors.

1696
02:25:30,989 --> 02:25:36,890
He's a big Cubs fan, a great person, and we all wish him well, Mr. President.

1697
02:25:41,910 --> 02:25:44,531
The records of the meeting of December 6th, St.

1698
02:25:44,571 --> 02:25:47,671
Nicholas Day, 2016, were passed to Councilor Scott Pelli.

1699
02:25:47,951 --> 02:25:49,352
Councilor, how did you find those?

1700
02:25:49,732 --> 02:25:52,772
I found these all in order and accept.

1701
02:25:53,272 --> 02:25:56,493
On the motion for approval by Councilor Scott Pelli, all those in favor?

1702
02:25:57,473 --> 02:25:58,274
All those opposed?

1703
02:25:58,315 --> 02:25:59,597
The ayes have it.

1704
02:26:00,058 --> 02:26:02,802
On the motion of Councilor Falco, that the meeting be adjourned.

1705
02:26:03,604 --> 02:26:04,445
All those in favor?

1706
02:26:04,465 --> 02:26:04,525
Aye.

1707
02:26:05,246 --> 02:26:06,028
All those opposed?

1708
02:26:06,168 --> 02:26:07,350
Meeting is adjourned.
