1
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:26,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul said it's not.

2
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:48,620
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to call the Medford School Committee meeting to order for October 15, 2018.

3
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Could we all stand for the Pledge of Allegiance, please?

4
00:01:56,141 --> 00:02:07,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

5
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:12,525
[SPEAKER_06]: So first on the agenda is approval of minutes from our October 1, 2018 meeting.

6
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:14,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote.

[SPEAKER_06]: Motion of approval.

36
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:04,731
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

37
00:03:05,172 --> 00:03:05,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

38
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:06,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carried.

39
00:03:06,493 --> 00:03:09,015
[SPEAKER_06]: The approval of payrolls are approved.

40
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Report of Secretary.

41
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:14,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a very brief report.

42
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:17,964
[SPEAKER_13]: The other week, I signed an invoice to pay Irvine and Sons $36,650.

43
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:21,785
[SPEAKER_13]: Kathy, can you please speak into it?

44
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:22,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm not speaking into it.

45
00:03:23,025 --> 00:03:23,406
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

46
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:24,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep, sorry.

47
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:39,251
[SPEAKER_13]: The other week, I signed an invoice to pay Irvine and Sons $36,650 for Lock and Var vertical round replacement glass lined storage tank, which is a hot water tank.

48
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,721
[SPEAKER_13]: at Medford High School.

49
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,381
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was very interesting.

50
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:44,943
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't know what it was, so I wanted to share this with you.

51
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:51,146
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a very brief update about the tunnel slide piece that was delivered to the Columbus Elementary School.

52
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:59,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Currently, right now, the section of the slide is being stored at Hormel Stadium so that it will be safe and off the playground.

53
00:04:00,411 --> 00:04:07,595
[SPEAKER_13]: And Travis Arms, who is with Game Time, he'll be coming out sometime this week on Friday to inspect it to find out

54
00:04:08,643 --> 00:04:13,467
[SPEAKER_13]: if maybe they might have ordered the wrong part and they have to maybe resend it and get a new part.

55
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:15,648
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll let everybody know when there's another update.

56
00:04:15,869 --> 00:04:16,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

57
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:17,370
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

58
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,611
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Secretary Kretz.

59
00:04:20,312 --> 00:04:21,773
[SPEAKER_06]: Next is the report of committees.

60
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:25,996
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a committee of the whole report on the overview of MCAS.

61
00:04:26,676 --> 00:04:27,637
[SPEAKER_06]: It is lengthy.

62
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:31,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if Ms.

63
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Caldwell would like to sum up the meeting or I'm not sure who authored these.

64
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,479
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't offer them.

65
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:39,819
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

66
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I can speak to that.

67
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,103
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

68
00:04:45,264 --> 00:04:45,944
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

69
00:04:46,044 --> 00:04:47,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

70
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:57,213
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a committee of the whole meeting with the school committee to review our MCAS data as a district.

71
00:04:57,974 --> 00:05:06,721
[SPEAKER_15]: And we had very lengthy discussions about the progress that we made and the areas that we need to continue to focus on.

72
00:05:08,744 --> 00:05:10,289
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is, I know, quite lengthy.

73
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,396
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a four-page report, but we did discuss...

74
00:05:14,978 --> 00:05:16,800
[SPEAKER_15]: the progress of all of the schools.

75
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:24,907
[SPEAKER_15]: Math is an area that we will continue to focus on this year, and look at our math with diligence.

76
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:39,020
[SPEAKER_15]: We're gonna continue to work on science and ELA, and we will continue to bring updates on our assessments moving forward throughout this year, so that we don't have to wait only until the end of the year to hear official results.

77
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:40,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Superintendent.

78
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:54,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to comment, while we were at that meeting, we saw a large growth in our ELA due to the journeys program that we purchased four years ago.

79
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:59,349
[SPEAKER_09]: And it takes about three or four years when we purchase a program to see the growth.

80
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,150
[SPEAKER_09]: So that was really outstanding to see.

81
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,311
[SPEAKER_09]: We still have a long way to go.

82
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:13,309
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're all working together as a team to make strides and make the best education possible for all children in Method Public Schools.

83
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:20,412
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we invest so much money into new programming and piloting programming.

84
00:06:20,932 --> 00:06:27,095
[SPEAKER_09]: And as a committee, we talked a lot about the science program, the class program that is being piloted this year.

85
00:06:27,175 --> 00:06:32,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And we talked about it at our last meeting and how that is going to be tremendous for our children.

86
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,042
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, that growth won't be seen immediately.

87
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:38,305
[SPEAKER_09]: It might take a few years before we actually see it.

88
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:48,654
[SPEAKER_09]: So I personally have been waiting to see that growth in ELA, and I'm so grateful that we have that showing that it's actually working for our students.

89
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:59,264
[SPEAKER_09]: And I look forward to seeing what Lesley's partnership will do as far as MCAF schools and how they're going to help us move forward as a

90
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:00,745
[SPEAKER_09]: as a school district.

91
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:01,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

92
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:02,106
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

93
00:07:02,186 --> 00:07:05,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Do any of those members have anything to say about our MCAS Committee of the Whole?

94
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:07,188
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

95
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:09,849
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

96
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:10,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

97
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

98
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:11,730
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

99
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:15,091
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion carried to accept the Committee of the Whole report.

100
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:17,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Next is the Building and Grounds Subcommittee meeting.

101
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:25,616
[SPEAKER_06]: So today at 4 o'clock we have a Building and Grounds Committee regarding the playground at the Roberts, the surface of the playground.

102
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Aaron DiVenedetto, Kathy Kretz, and myself are on the building and grounds.

103
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:35,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I am the chair, so I'm not speaking as the chair tonight of the school committee, but right now as the chair of the buildings and grounds.

104
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:44,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, we were notified last week that the interlocking bricks that we were using for the playground surface are no longer being produced.

105
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:55,511
[SPEAKER_06]: The man who was the rep from the playground company came to our meeting today, and he explained that a surface in another part of the country

106
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:58,772
[SPEAKER_06]: had the bricks in for only a year and a half and they were cracks.

107
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:07,834
[SPEAKER_06]: So it had to do with the UA, some fancy chemical word, UV, and that they halted production.

108
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:11,375
[SPEAKER_06]: So Christine, please feel free to stay up because I'm sure I'll forget some of the other words.

109
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:14,716
[SPEAKER_06]: And that he came to give us other options.

110
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:17,217
[SPEAKER_06]: So when the original options were presented,

111
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:27,105
[SPEAKER_06]: when Cheryl Rodriguez did the research, it was these interlocking breaks, a poor in place surface, or a rubber bond surface.

112
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:42,916
[SPEAKER_06]: So from the meeting, we heard from Travis, the playground rep, and from other peoples in the community, a woman who's a member, Roberta Cameron, from the Community Preservation Committee was there to make sure that the grant and its language would be able to

113
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:49,478
[SPEAKER_06]: still, the grant money could still be used for a rubber bond surface.

114
00:08:49,618 --> 00:08:56,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Kathy, Erin, and I voted to move forward because the CPC will still fund it.

115
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:02,328
[SPEAKER_06]: The one issue that we have to address this week that our assistant superintendent, Ms.

116
00:09:02,368 --> 00:09:04,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Patterson, is addressing is the state bid list.

117
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,634
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is what I don't understand at all that much if you want to add on from here.

118
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:10,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

119
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:12,279
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you.

120
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:21,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to clarify, it's the UV inhibitor that the chemical composition has some malfunctions that they are working out and will not be available.

121
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:30,505
[SPEAKER_01]: So the alternate product type is not a standard pour-in-place, but it's a rubber bond pour-in-place material.

122
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:41,089
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to just address the state bid for that type of a material, because the original procurement through the state bid was a tile.

123
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,100
[SPEAKER_01]: material.

124
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,282
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just need to solicit two additional quotes from the state bid.

125
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:53,105
[SPEAKER_01]: If we do not receive any, we will move forward, proceed, and continue with this project.

126
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:54,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

127
00:09:56,807 --> 00:10:10,473
[SPEAKER_03]: It's disappointing that the tiles are not being produced anymore in the sense that a tile gives you an easily replaceable piece, while the pour is a much bigger problem.

128
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:15,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know what the life expectancy of the pour is?

129
00:10:16,172 --> 00:10:16,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

130
00:10:16,452 --> 00:10:37,272
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did have with the rep available today was that the rubber bond pour in place is actually superior in quality in that it is higher rated for safety, for falls, and it is also will be guaranteed the 10-year warranty similar to the tile that we had originally requested.

131
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:53,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Given the standard pour-in-place has lasted thus long, even though there is deterioration, the rubber bond pour-in-place will have a much greater life expectancy in that the top coat, there's two components to it.

132
00:10:53,907 --> 00:11:05,275
[SPEAKER_01]: The top coat is an inch and a half thick that has an adhesive sealant that will then go over the mulch fitting subflooring underneath it.

133
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:09,672
[SPEAKER_01]: it will last longer in its original form.

134
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:22,201
[SPEAKER_01]: So where there are some areas currently that it's hard or soft in that capacity, as this type of material will age, it will remain consistent in its footing.

135
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:28,966
[SPEAKER_01]: You are correct in that if there is a need for replacement, it would have to be cut and repoured.

136
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:32,729
[SPEAKER_01]: The hope is that that will not have to take place.

137
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:35,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, two things that I have to take from this.

138
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:42,391
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is, it's terrific that the grant is still going to cover this, even though it's not a tile.

139
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that I'm greatly relieved to hear that news tonight.

140
00:11:46,094 --> 00:11:56,104
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second is, as difficult as it was that this project did not move forward quicker, in retrospect, now we can look back and say, thank God it didn't move

141
00:11:56,789 --> 00:12:02,675
[SPEAKER_03]: quicker because we would then have an inappropriate tile that was defective.

142
00:12:03,116 --> 00:12:09,963
[SPEAKER_03]: So God works in strange and unusual ways, and this may be one of them, but I am so very glad to hear that we can move ahead now.

143
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:13,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we need to take a vote in order to accomplish that of any sort?

144
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:18,992
[SPEAKER_01]: We already accomplished that at the subcommittee meeting, and we did get the approval from the chair

145
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:22,233
[SPEAKER_01]: chairperson of the CBC, so we are scheduled to move forward.

146
00:12:22,253 --> 00:12:23,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to vote again here?

147
00:12:23,354 --> 00:12:25,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we need to vote again on the school committee floor.

148
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:26,457
[SPEAKER_06]: We can vote again.

149
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:26,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

150
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:27,818
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd love to vote here.

151
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:28,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'll record.

152
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:30,240
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's the motion, Paula?

153
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want us to give the motion that we gave today?

154
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what was the motion that you gave?

155
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:44,070
[SPEAKER_09]: So Erin gave the motion to... I gave the motion today to move forward with the CBC funding, as well as to give Ms.

156
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Patterson the authority to put out

157
00:12:48,848 --> 00:12:58,555
[SPEAKER_09]: the two other quotes for this and to move forward once those are obtained and to start the project as soon as possible.

158
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:04,119
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was approved there unanimously, and I hope that my colleague... And I second.

159
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:04,760
[SPEAKER_09]: So moved.

160
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,001
[SPEAKER_01]: So now roll call vote.

161
00:13:07,101 --> 00:13:07,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Point of information.

162
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:08,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

163
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:08,923
[SPEAKER_13]: And I second it.

164
00:13:09,063 --> 00:13:09,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

165
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:10,204
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

166
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:11,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Erin DiBenedetto.

167
00:13:11,264 --> 00:13:12,205
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, Kathy.

168
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:13,246
[SPEAKER_01]: Point of information.

169
00:13:13,306 --> 00:13:17,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so that everybody is aware at the subcommittee today as well,

170
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:32,002
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to retrieving additional quotes on the state bid, we did indicate that the timeline, the expectation, and the hope is that it will be as soon as possible for the vendor to facilitate this.

171
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:39,564
[SPEAKER_01]: That would also include the disposal, removal of the existing pending weather and or other issues.

172
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:43,965
[SPEAKER_01]: The anticipated timeline is three days for removal of existing.

173
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:53,703
[SPEAKER_01]: three days for the pour in place and an additional 48 to 72 hours for the material to cure.

174
00:13:54,143 --> 00:14:03,970
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at a week and a half of non-use for that playground during the removal of existing and the completion of the new surface.

175
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on weather as well.

176
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:06,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

177
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:14,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it need to be poured while under a certain temperature?

178
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:24,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it needs to be above certain temperatures and can't have any rain, which is why the timeline is dependent on some of the weather components.

179
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:29,157
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the exact temperature, but it's got to be over freezing and such.

180
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:36,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does take three, they usually have three days so that they pour, they have some seams, and then it's adhered to.

181
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:40,154
[SPEAKER_01]: all together, which is why they've requested three days for the install.

182
00:14:43,435 --> 00:14:43,896
[SPEAKER_09]: My vote is.

183
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,156
[SPEAKER_06]: So the motion was by Erin, seconded by Kathy.

184
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:46,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

185
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:48,397
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

186
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:49,298
[SPEAKER_13]: My vote, yes.

187
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:49,898
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

188
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:50,398
[SPEAKER_13]: First on the list.

189
00:14:50,438 --> 00:14:51,358
[SPEAKER_13]: Erin DiBenedetto?

190
00:14:51,678 --> 00:14:52,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Kathy Kretz?

191
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:53,319
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

192
00:14:53,539 --> 00:14:53,659
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

193
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,139
[SPEAKER_13]: Simpstone?

194
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:54,499
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

195
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Ruggiero?

196
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:55,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

197
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Russo?

198
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:57,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

199
00:14:58,301 --> 00:14:59,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Mrs. Van de Kloot?

200
00:14:59,141 --> 00:14:59,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

201
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:00,522
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke?

202
00:15:01,202 --> 00:15:01,482
[SPEAKER_13]: Absent.

203
00:15:05,435 --> 00:15:07,336
[SPEAKER_06]: absent, a motion passes.

204
00:15:07,496 --> 00:15:08,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

205
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:08,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Patterson.

206
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:11,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Next on the agenda is community participation.

207
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,280
[SPEAKER_06]: I do see some parents here.

208
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:16,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if there's any new issue the parents want to talk about.

209
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:17,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

210
00:15:17,463 --> 00:15:18,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on up, please.

211
00:15:18,404 --> 00:15:25,348
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a presentation from Jenny, and I'm not sure of the other parents' names, but please come forward.

212
00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:30,292
[SPEAKER_15]: And a flyer was put in the additional folder.

213
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:36,168
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you please say your name and address for the record?

214
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:39,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, it's Jenny Graham, 7 Raleigh Road.

215
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:43,876
In your, can you hear me okay?

216
00:15:44,197 --> 00:15:44,757
Oh, is that better?

217
00:15:44,937 --> 00:15:46,159
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

218
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you guys want to introduce yourselves before we start?

219
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:51,765
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my name is Katie, I'm 21 Carberry Street.

220
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:54,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Shaw Rodriguez, 21 Park Street.

221
00:15:56,592 --> 00:16:05,303
[SPEAKER_12]: So you guys have a flyer in your pockets and what that outlines is some work that has been going on across the four elementary schools since

222
00:16:06,327 --> 00:16:12,010
[SPEAKER_12]: this summer to try to collaborate on some joint fundraising activity.

223
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:16,733
[SPEAKER_12]: So as you may know, all of the elementary schools have their own PTOs.

224
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:18,874
[SPEAKER_12]: We all have our own board structures.

225
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:24,477
[SPEAKER_12]: We all have our own events that we hold annually, and we all try new things all of the time.

226
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:28,559
[SPEAKER_12]: And this past summer, a group of folks convened to say,

227
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,680
[SPEAKER_12]: are there ways that we can work together?

228
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Last spring we had a small but successful joint fundraiser and it was a lot of fun.

229
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:46,967
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think at that first meeting about 20 or so people, maybe 25 joined us with representation from all four of the elementary schools.

230
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:54,210
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what we did in that initial meeting was talk about just some kind of intent and ground rules in terms of

231
00:16:54,782 --> 00:16:59,870
[SPEAKER_12]: how we would work together, and we really came up with a couple of overarching rules.

232
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:08,102
[SPEAKER_12]: One is just that the goal is for us to get to know each other in a little bit of a different capacity than we have an opportunity to on a daily basis.

233
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:18,175
[SPEAKER_12]: Also to do some joint fundraising in places where the fundraising doesn't cannibalize other efforts from each of the individual schools.

234
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:26,378
[SPEAKER_12]: So we thought really carefully about things like things that are happening already in certain schools and the calendar and trying to figure out kind of where to go.

235
00:17:26,418 --> 00:17:28,038
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we brainstormed some ideas.

236
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:33,440
[SPEAKER_12]: And there were like 20 or so ideas that we talked about in that time.

237
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:37,282
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we did agree to is we were going to do a couple so that we didn't try to

238
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:41,749
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of boil the ocean and have too many things to do and have everybody get fatigued.

239
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:50,734
[SPEAKER_12]: So out of that meeting, we actually sort of locked in on a couple of different ideas, and that's what's on your one-page summary.

240
00:17:52,014 --> 00:18:00,319
[SPEAKER_12]: And Christy's going to talk about the first item, which we are just launching, and then Cheryl will talk about the second one, and then we'll be happy to answer questions.

241
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:00,819
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

242
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:03,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi everyone.

243
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:11,097
[SPEAKER_10]: So the first event that you have on your paper is a fundraiser that we've launched just this week.

244
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:20,285
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are incredibly, incredibly excited that the four elementary schools are going to be fundraising together for a raffle that's going to continue for the next two months.

245
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:24,409
[SPEAKER_10]: The grand prize for this raffle is a Disney vacation.

246
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:27,632
[SPEAKER_10]: So something that we thought would really appeal to a lot of

247
00:18:28,036 --> 00:18:31,498
[SPEAKER_10]: elementary school families and other families throughout Medford.

248
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:51,592
[SPEAKER_10]: We did a lot of work over the summer with the Attorney General's Office obtaining all of the proper raffle permits from the city of Medford, also working with an accountant that works with a lot of local nonprofits to make sure that we've sort of structured this raffle in a way that's going to benefit the PTOs and provide a really great prize.

249
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:54,474
[SPEAKER_10]: So the prize in this case is going to be awarded as a $5,000

250
00:18:56,133 --> 00:19:01,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Disney gift card that the winner can use to book a vacation at a Disney resort or a Disney cruise.

251
00:19:03,035 --> 00:19:10,677
[SPEAKER_10]: And the assistant principal at the book school, Shannon DeMose, is actually a Disney expert who really loves to help family and friends plan Disney vacation.

252
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:15,958
[SPEAKER_10]: So she's offered to help the winners plan their trip if they so choose.

253
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:21,640
[SPEAKER_10]: The raffle prize in this case, because it's such a large prize, is taxable income.

254
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,760
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have offered

255
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:33,189
[SPEAKER_10]: the option to take the prize in cash, cash equivalent, which a person can use to take a Disney vacation but have some cash on hand to handle the tax impact.

256
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:40,371
[SPEAKER_10]: Or if somebody doesn't want to take a vacation or a Disney trip, they can just take the $5,000 cash as their winnings.

257
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,672
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have a second prize, which is a $250 Disney gift card.

258
00:19:45,332 --> 00:19:50,433
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have been planning to sell raffle tickets at events throughout the city.

259
00:19:50,493 --> 00:19:51,593
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's going to

260
00:19:52,017 --> 00:19:53,398
[SPEAKER_10]: really serve twofold purpose.

261
00:19:53,438 --> 00:19:57,981
[SPEAKER_10]: Number one, really get the four elementary schools working together in fundraising.

262
00:19:58,021 --> 00:20:00,162
[SPEAKER_10]: And then two, we hope to raise a lot of money.

263
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:04,885
[SPEAKER_10]: This idea was modeled on another town on the South Shore that did a similar raffle.

264
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:07,427
[SPEAKER_10]: They successfully raised over $10,000, $15,000 each year that they do this.

265
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:08,527
[SPEAKER_10]: So we hope it's going to be

266
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:23,754
[SPEAKER_10]: really successful, will come to all of you, hopefully, to participate in the raffle as well, and we will be drawing the winning ticket at the December 17th school committee meeting.

267
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:33,941
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have a minimum number of tickets required, so if we haven't sold the minimum number at that point, then the raffle would be bumped until the January school committee meeting.

268
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:37,983
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're super excited, and I'm happy to answer any questions about it if you have them.

269
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:39,364
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds great.

270
00:20:42,006 --> 00:20:43,247
[SPEAKER_10]: So who's donating the prize?

271
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:47,251
[SPEAKER_10]: So the prize is being paid for from the raffle proceeds.

272
00:20:47,951 --> 00:21:01,304
[SPEAKER_10]: We are looking at some different ways to obtain a discounted raffle gift card through Target or through like a buying club, like a Sam's Buying Club or a Costco.

273
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:05,868
[SPEAKER_10]: Disney unfortunately doesn't give away these kinds of trips.

274
00:21:05,928 --> 00:21:06,909
[SPEAKER_10]: We did look into it.

275
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:16,095
[SPEAKER_10]: They do give away copper passes for community organizations, but it requires a lot of lead time, so that's something that we're going to look into for future years.

276
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:17,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

277
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:28,339
[SPEAKER_03]: You're planning on selling a lot of tickets, but the small cost of the tickets may work in your favor, because everybody can afford a ticket, so great.

278
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:35,382
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to tell you that you guys are reinventing the Home and School Association, the Medford Home and School Association,

279
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:48,352
[SPEAKER_03]: which has a deep history way back when, because I know it's something that I was involved in way back when, and the idea of it was exactly what you were doing, but at that time we had 13 schools all together.

280
00:21:48,992 --> 00:21:53,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, we had a logo, and the logo was an umbrella because we were bringing everybody together under one umbrella.

281
00:21:54,954 --> 00:22:04,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only did we do the sort of fundraising that you're doing, which was to say a citywide component, but we also, and this is just in the future, when you want something to do,

282
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:21,358
[SPEAKER_03]: We ran events, like we brought in the Bennington Puppets, something that, that one's just, we brought in the Boston Ballet, something that one school and group of fundraisers could not do, could not have the energy, but together

283
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:24,386
[SPEAKER_03]: people working together could do really fantastic things.

284
00:22:24,446 --> 00:22:26,987
[SPEAKER_03]: So congratulations, and I'm so glad to see this effort.

285
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:36,589
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want any more information about the original, I can certainly tell you, but it is... I don't know what name you want to give us, Medford Elementary Citywide.

286
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:38,490
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't say just elementary.

287
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the Medford Home and School Association.

288
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:41,811
[SPEAKER_03]: So throw it out there.

289
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:43,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

290
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:45,412
[SPEAKER_12]: Cheryl, do you want to talk about the second item?

291
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:52,039
[SPEAKER_07]: What an excellent segue, Paulette, into my portion of our fundraising efforts.

292
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:57,962
[SPEAKER_07]: So the event that we're planning for the spring is something that I've been dreaming about since my daughter was in kindergarten.

293
00:22:57,982 --> 00:23:00,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a fifth grade parent, so unfortunately I'm aging out.

294
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:04,465
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully we'll be replicating this entire thing in middle school after we iron out the cakes.

295
00:23:05,095 --> 00:23:05,815
[SPEAKER_07]: elementary level.

296
00:23:06,616 --> 00:23:16,961
[SPEAKER_07]: So on March 13th we've reserved the brand new high school gym and we'll be welcoming the Harlem Wizards to play against the celebrity teachers and staff from all of our elementary schools.

297
00:23:17,482 --> 00:23:23,465
[SPEAKER_07]: So we announced it at our Roberts PTO meeting and to uproarious applause from the teachers.

298
00:23:24,085 --> 00:23:35,015
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pretty excited and they've already gathered a team and we'll be putting out some promo videos on the various PTO pages that teaches training and getting excited to play.

299
00:23:35,895 --> 00:23:38,836
[SPEAKER_07]: The tickets will be $15 a piece.

300
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Each school will have five to seven representatives.

301
00:23:41,956 --> 00:23:43,737
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to get hotel rooms.

302
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:49,078
[SPEAKER_07]: And we already have a trainer that will be there for all of the aches and pains.

303
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,378
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's Boston Physical Therapy and Wellness has donated their time.

304
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:54,639
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're very excited to see that move forward.

305
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,199
[SPEAKER_07]: So keep an eye out on all the PTO pages.

306
00:23:57,219 --> 00:24:00,260
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be spreading that information when tickets go on sale in January.

307
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:01,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

308
00:24:02,962 --> 00:24:12,808
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the last event, well the last two events on your page, one planned for electronics recycling, which actually was the first thing we did last spring when we all worked together.

309
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:19,412
[SPEAKER_12]: It's quick and easy, unlike learning the ins and outs of how to run a legal raffle in Massachusetts.

310
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:20,593
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a different amount of work.

311
00:24:22,434 --> 00:24:27,658
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we'll kind of cash in on quick and easy this spring as well with the electronics recycling.

312
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:39,650
[SPEAKER_12]: We actually just last week decided that we have an upcoming professional day which is on election day and we'll be hosting a free skate at La Conte rink.

313
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:49,841
[SPEAKER_12]: Bobby Maloney was willing to work with us and we'll be charging five dollars for admission and the proceeds will be split between the four elementary schools and everyone is welcome to join us.

314
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:50,702
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll have

315
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:52,924
[SPEAKER_12]: rentals there for a small fee.

316
00:24:52,984 --> 00:25:01,931
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was something that we at the Brooks have started doing on professional days is having something available for folks and for a small fundraiser.

317
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:08,176
[SPEAKER_12]: And we decided that with something like that, having more folks interested in coming to it would be better.

318
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:12,800
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll be doing the very same thing with that event in terms of splitting the proceeds and all that good stuff.

319
00:25:13,897 --> 00:25:27,151
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I think as we go forward, we had some big ideas like having a gala where we honor teachers in the district and all kinds of like really cool things that just take a little bit more than a couple of weeks to pull together.

320
00:25:27,291 --> 00:25:32,157
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have some ideas on how to continue this momentum forward and it could mean

321
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:34,727
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of bringing other schools into the fold.

322
00:25:34,787 --> 00:25:42,990
[SPEAKER_12]: But one of the things we really wanted to do was start small enough that we could be successful, rather than trying to start too big and having the whole thing kind of burn out.

323
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,511
[SPEAKER_12]: So we wanted to try to do this.

324
00:25:45,951 --> 00:25:54,314
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the big thing for us is everyone's going to come together to fundraise, and then the independent PTOs and their structures will make decisions on how their share is spent.

325
00:25:54,414 --> 00:25:58,676
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's no global obligation in terms of how the money will be spent.

326
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:06,462
[SPEAKER_12]: that power will be kind of remaining with the individual PTOs who all have different needs for their students and their buildings.

327
00:26:06,502 --> 00:26:13,568
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is just hopefully a way to infuse dollars into the process rather than make decisions.

328
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:14,609
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

329
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:15,090
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

330
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Wonderful.

331
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,791
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of exciting things happening.

332
00:26:16,811 --> 00:26:17,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.

333
00:26:17,872 --> 00:26:19,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other questions for us?

334
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:20,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm so excited.

335
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:22,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

336
00:26:22,075 --> 00:26:23,917
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll be kind of all over the place.

337
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:30,301
[SPEAKER_12]: We're trying to schedule the dates and the times for all of the places where we'll be selling raffle tickets.

338
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:43,391
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're going to try to be out in the community as much as we are in the elementary schools so that we have a bigger reach and a bigger draw to kind of bring into the fold when we look at proceeds.

339
00:26:44,712 --> 00:26:49,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a point of information, open houses at the high school and the vocational school

340
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:53,338
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't go in and sell them there?

341
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:55,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Their PTO is conducting their own raffle that evening.

342
00:26:56,602 --> 00:26:57,503
[SPEAKER_07]: So they asked us not to come.

343
00:26:57,523 --> 00:26:59,706
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are going to be at the football game on Friday.

344
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:02,750
[SPEAKER_07]: All the elementary schools will be selling on election day as well.

345
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,312
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have some other things lined up.

346
00:27:05,235 --> 00:27:12,561
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are some businesses in the community that have offered to let us set up a table and sell in their locations as well.

347
00:27:12,621 --> 00:27:25,593
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're hoping that being able to kind of reach across the community, even to folks who don't necessarily have school-age children, will help drive a successful raffle.

348
00:27:26,373 --> 00:27:30,216
[SPEAKER_12]: The communities that do this have a really, really successful turnout.

349
00:27:30,696 --> 00:27:38,061
[SPEAKER_12]: And they think it's because of the low ticket price, which I sort of agree will make the buying a lot easier.

350
00:27:38,102 --> 00:27:38,622
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll see.

351
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:40,944
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

352
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:43,125
[SPEAKER_12]: And we'll be at movie night on Saturday?

353
00:27:43,585 --> 00:27:43,966
[SPEAKER_12]: Saturday.

354
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:46,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

355
00:27:47,068 --> 00:27:48,349
[SPEAKER_12]: The movie night at the field.

356
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

357
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,710
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

358
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:54,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Next on the agenda is our report of superintendent.

359
00:27:55,154 --> 00:27:55,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Maurice?

360
00:28:00,857 --> 00:28:06,420
[SPEAKER_15]: So for the past two weeks, I have, again, continuing to be out in the field.

361
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:14,925
[SPEAKER_15]: And there have just been a few things that have been happening in the school system that I wanted to just recognize today.

362
00:28:16,005 --> 00:28:22,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Later, you'll be receiving a more in-depth report from Chad Fallon, our headmaster at the vocational school.

363
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:33,623
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just wanted to recognize that we were there and several members of the school committee were able to attend the Bistro's grand opening, which was definitely a fun event.

364
00:28:34,484 --> 00:28:40,229
[SPEAKER_15]: I also participated in my NSUP training, which is the new superintendent induction program.

365
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:43,372
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I will continue to participate in that all year.

366
00:28:43,432 --> 00:29:01,513
[SPEAKER_15]: I was in Marlborough and we were working on looking at district initiatives and continuing to work towards our assignments and leading towards our end goal of having a new district vision that will be three to five years in scope.

367
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:08,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Additionally, I was able to attend the Mayor's big table, big ideas.

368
00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:17,520
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a cross-functional team of members of the city where we had an opportunity to look at issues that are facing Medford and our students.

369
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:22,769
[SPEAKER_15]: around food, housing, and health concerns.

370
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:32,692
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was very informative for me to see how other aspects of the city are going to support the work that's happening for our students

371
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:38,697
[SPEAKER_15]: food pantry and those things along those lines.

372
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:50,108
[SPEAKER_15]: I also wanted to just recognize the Yoki restaurant that did a golf tournament to support our Medford family network.

373
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,029
[SPEAKER_15]: The golf tournament raised $5,000.

374
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:54,291
[SPEAKER_15]: There were 72 golfers who participated.

375
00:29:57,495 --> 00:30:07,648
[SPEAKER_15]: This event took place on Columbus Day and I'm just very appreciative and thankful for their support of our own Medford Family Network.

376
00:30:09,928 --> 00:30:13,410
[SPEAKER_15]: There was also another band clinic that took place.

377
00:30:14,491 --> 00:30:16,412
[SPEAKER_15]: And so our band is very, very active.

378
00:30:16,452 --> 00:30:20,395
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of families are involved, including members of our school committee.

379
00:30:21,215 --> 00:30:34,244
[SPEAKER_15]: And this clinic that took place over the past weekend was an opportunity for our band students and the other bands that chose to participate to receive feedback.

380
00:30:35,005 --> 00:30:38,413
[SPEAKER_15]: and be critiqued in order to improve their practice.

381
00:30:38,874 --> 00:30:44,588
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, having that criticism, but positive criticism to help you improve.

382
00:30:45,065 --> 00:30:56,089
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a best practice, and I just thought it was worthy of noting that even in a non-academic setting, such as band, that that's something that they actively participate in.

383
00:30:56,609 --> 00:31:01,691
[SPEAKER_15]: So they are striving to be even more excellent than where they are right now.

384
00:31:02,331 --> 00:31:04,892
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I just wanted to recognize their hard work.

385
00:31:05,578 --> 00:31:11,801
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to recognize the Band families because they truly practice a lot late in the evening.

386
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:14,782
[SPEAKER_15]: And so when I'm leaving late in the evening, they're still there.

387
00:31:16,062 --> 00:31:19,324
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I just want to recognize their hard work and dedication.

388
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:24,726
[SPEAKER_15]: On the sports front, we've been having some victories with our different sports teams.

389
00:31:25,506 --> 00:31:28,347
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've truly been enjoying that as well.

390
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:56,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Lastly, I just wanted to recognize yesterday, those of you who were able to come out, there was a Taste of Italy at Medford High School that was a fundraiser for the Kiwanis, and they also support Medford Public Schools, and so I was able to really taste delicious Italian food yesterday, and there was a lot of camaraderie and friendship, and a lot of friends of Medford Public Schools were there,

391
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:05,368
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank them for their continued support and committee member Paulette Vander Kloot was there sitting at the table with me yesterday.

392
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:11,571
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, there were many other members from Medford who were able to support that event.

393
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:22,256
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to recognize those things that happened over the past two weeks and continue just to keep you informed of what's happening in Medford and Medford Public Schools.

394
00:32:24,157 --> 00:32:27,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Following that, I would like to present

395
00:32:27,682 --> 00:32:34,727
[SPEAKER_15]: my first report to you on the math learning walk to give you a report of findings.

396
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,248
[SPEAKER_15]: I did share this with you.

397
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:47,577
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to just share with the team and the community at large that the math learning walk that took place with Lesley University being our partner

398
00:32:49,248 --> 00:33:02,340
[SPEAKER_15]: the math director, math coaches, all elementary school principals, my associate superintendent, Diane Caldwell, Bernadette Riccardelli, director of curriculum,

399
00:33:04,118 --> 00:33:08,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Lisa Evangelista was also able to accompany us on these math learning walks.

400
00:33:09,124 --> 00:33:10,906
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was a cross-functional team.

401
00:33:11,667 --> 00:33:21,959
[SPEAKER_15]: And on this form where I talk about what was the lens that we used to look at instruction, and we used the five core actions.

402
00:33:22,738 --> 00:33:35,201
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we went in to look at instruction, we wanted to all be in agreement so that we were looking at the same things or looking for the same indicators.

403
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:39,843
[SPEAKER_15]: And so by using the core actions, they were in bold.

404
00:33:40,203 --> 00:33:51,486
[SPEAKER_15]: The five key core actions are evidence-based responses, productive struggle, academic discourse, access for all, and feedback.

405
00:33:52,587 --> 00:34:02,993
[SPEAKER_15]: These five core actions, although we were using it during the math learning walk, the five core actions are applicable to all content areas.

406
00:34:03,473 --> 00:34:08,236
[SPEAKER_15]: So that includes literacy, that includes science and social studies.

407
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:10,437
[SPEAKER_15]: So the core actions are

408
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:17,118
[SPEAKER_15]: these five key moves that you should be able to see happening during a lesson.

409
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:23,000
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we went to observe classrooms, we were only in the classroom for 15 minutes.

410
00:34:23,581 --> 00:34:27,923
[SPEAKER_15]: So we did not see a full lesson from start to finish.

411
00:34:28,683 --> 00:34:37,127
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes we saw the beginning of a lesson, sometimes we saw the middle, and depending on the schedule, sometimes we saw the end of the lesson.

412
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:53,447
[SPEAKER_15]: We were able to look at approximately 48 classrooms across all four schools, about 12 classrooms per elementary school, and each team had approximately three to four people looking at instruction.

413
00:34:53,967 --> 00:35:02,114
[SPEAKER_15]: So we were looking at the five core actions, and we were also looking at the general environment of classrooms.

414
00:35:02,497 --> 00:35:20,263
[SPEAKER_15]: And so in this report, I was really pleased to just highlight that in every single classroom, we observed three of the five core actions in all classrooms at some level.

415
00:35:20,843 --> 00:35:31,327
[SPEAKER_15]: Those three areas where we saw greater evidence during the instruction that we were looking at during this 15-minute clip, it was evidence-based responses,

416
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:44,142
[SPEAKER_15]: academic discourse, teachers using official academic language during instruction, and access for all, which really is what are the types of accommodations that teachers are using.

417
00:35:44,162 --> 00:35:46,823
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they meeting the needs of students with disabilities?

418
00:35:47,203 --> 00:35:50,203
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they meeting the needs of students that are English language learners?

419
00:35:50,684 --> 00:35:53,924
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they meeting the needs of students that are gifted and talented?

420
00:35:54,344 --> 00:35:57,945
[SPEAKER_15]: So both ends of the spectrum, all types of learners,

421
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:00,306
[SPEAKER_15]: was there access for all?

422
00:36:00,606 --> 00:36:01,809
[SPEAKER_15]: And we saw plenty of it.

423
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:09,944
[SPEAKER_15]: We saw a lot of use, appropriate use of technology, the use of manipulatives, because it was math, there were a lot of counters

424
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,248
[SPEAKER_15]: and blocks and cubes.

425
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:23,590
[SPEAKER_15]: So students that want to touch manipulatives to help them understand a concept, they had more than one modality to grasp what was being taught.

426
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,551
[SPEAKER_15]: So we were really pleased with that.

427
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:34,232
[SPEAKER_15]: And the other two core actions that we didn't see as much evidence of were productive struggle and feedback.

428
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:37,393
[SPEAKER_15]: And so productive struggle, again,

429
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:46,687
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not that it did not exist, we just did not see it at the same extent as the other three core actions.

430
00:36:47,227 --> 00:36:59,615
[SPEAKER_15]: I think also it's important that I say the teachers, when we went in to observe, they had no idea what indicators we were using.

431
00:37:00,396 --> 00:37:07,340
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the five core actions, now that we are sharing it with you, what the five core actions were that we used

432
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:14,272
[SPEAKER_15]: The school leaders ended up learning about the core actions, but now the teachers are going to find out.

433
00:37:14,642 --> 00:37:16,223
[SPEAKER_15]: These are the five core actions.

434
00:37:16,703 --> 00:37:21,205
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we're going to roll it out slowly throughout the district so that they can just be aware.

435
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:22,866
[SPEAKER_15]: These are just best practices.

436
00:37:23,266 --> 00:37:28,468
[SPEAKER_15]: It already exists, but it's being able to call it out and being able to use it.

437
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:41,394
[SPEAKER_15]: So as moving forward in professional development with the additional department heads and directors and others that are going into classrooms, we're going to start using common language

438
00:37:41,947 --> 00:37:49,113
[SPEAKER_15]: of the core actions to say, are we seeing evidence of these core actions while we are looking at instruction?

439
00:37:50,314 --> 00:37:52,716
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is my synopsis.

440
00:37:53,257 --> 00:38:00,843
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, from the environmental perspective, elementary classrooms truly are warm, welcoming, and very, very inviting.

441
00:38:01,184 --> 00:38:06,068
[SPEAKER_15]: So we were very excited about that positive piece of data as well.

442
00:38:06,248 --> 00:38:06,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

443
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:07,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

444
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

445
00:38:09,441 --> 00:38:10,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

446
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:12,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Second by Ms.

447
00:38:12,664 --> 00:38:12,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Kretz.

448
00:38:14,145 --> 00:38:14,905
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

449
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:15,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

450
00:38:15,386 --> 00:38:16,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carried.

451
00:38:16,246 --> 00:38:16,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

452
00:38:16,787 --> 00:38:17,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Doctor.

453
00:38:18,108 --> 00:38:21,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Next is the recommendation to approve the Puerto Rico field trip.

454
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure who's asking.

455
00:38:22,892 --> 00:38:24,693
[SPEAKER_15]: We have Nelida Lepore.

456
00:38:25,454 --> 00:38:28,956
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Nelida Lepore, please come and share with us.

457
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:31,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

458
00:38:31,939 --> 00:38:32,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

459
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:36,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Nelida Lepore and I teach at Medford High School and I live at 117 Whitney Road.

460
00:38:38,085 --> 00:38:44,007
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe you've received the three handouts that Victoria Glasser and I sent.

461
00:38:44,147 --> 00:38:46,068
[SPEAKER_04]: We are both working.

462
00:38:46,268 --> 00:38:48,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm working with her on this trip.

463
00:38:48,969 --> 00:38:49,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I approached her.

464
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:53,651
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, I've been doing trips for Medford High School since 1999.

465
00:38:54,151 --> 00:39:04,496
[SPEAKER_04]: And I approached her about our service trips and thought perhaps Puerto Rico should be the next service trip due to Hurricane Maria.

466
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:07,837
[SPEAKER_04]: And as we're seeing now what's happening throughout the country,

467
00:39:08,534 --> 00:39:10,115
[SPEAKER_04]: with these disasters.

468
00:39:10,756 --> 00:39:18,523
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the cover sheet you saw, pretty much broke down the what, the when, the where, the why.

469
00:39:19,544 --> 00:39:24,468
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're planning the trip for February 13th through the 20th.

470
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:27,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to take my glasses off to read.

471
00:39:30,213 --> 00:39:31,634
[SPEAKER_04]: It's myself, Victoria.

472
00:39:31,734 --> 00:39:34,877
[SPEAKER_04]: She could not attend this evening because she was teaching a class this evening.

473
00:39:35,517 --> 00:39:41,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Joan Bowen, Megan Coyne, Eric Eisner, Nelson Maldonado, and the Vamanos Tour Director.

474
00:39:42,222 --> 00:39:43,503
[SPEAKER_04]: I have used this company.

475
00:39:43,543 --> 00:39:45,225
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be my fifth trip with them.

476
00:39:45,825 --> 00:39:49,728
[SPEAKER_04]: I have done two trips to Puerto Rico with the students from Medford High.

477
00:39:49,868 --> 00:39:55,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I arranged a trip to Cuba with this company, and I took 20 teachers on that one.

478
00:39:55,773 --> 00:39:59,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just, the last trip I took to Spain, they are expanding.

479
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:03,979
[SPEAKER_04]: I used this company also to go to Madrid and Barcelona.

480
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:06,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

481
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:14,261
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, it is to provide our students with an innovative and exciting cultural and service opportunity abroad.

482
00:40:14,922 --> 00:40:22,884
[SPEAKER_04]: The nice thing about going to Puerto Rico is that it is part of the United States, but you actually feel like you're in a foreign country while you're there.

483
00:40:23,324 --> 00:40:26,625
[SPEAKER_04]: So they will have the ability to use their language skills

484
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:48,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it's not required to speak Spanish to go on these trips, but the nice thing is the student who does or is studying the language will have the opportunity, and that student that isn't can explore that opportunity, and someone who studies one of the other Romance languages can see how they are sisters in their roots.

485
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:56,394
[SPEAKER_04]: This trip closely aligns with the core values of Medford High School, collaboration, engagement, integrity,

486
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,521
[SPEAKER_04]: and critical and creative minds.

487
00:40:59,201 --> 00:41:01,622
[SPEAKER_04]: And here we did a breakdown.

488
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:05,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I need to read this to you.

489
00:41:06,403 --> 00:41:08,623
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you've had a chance to read it.

490
00:41:09,524 --> 00:41:10,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

491
00:41:10,244 --> 00:41:19,125
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you have any questions for me, but on the back page we also put in the insurance and the trip cost.

492
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:20,906
[SPEAKER_04]: The trip cost was initially $2,800.

493
00:41:22,343 --> 00:41:27,306
[SPEAKER_04]: But the nice thing about this company is as the numbers increase, the cost drops.

494
00:41:27,866 --> 00:41:33,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So we currently have 39 students that have registered to sign up for the trip.

495
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,991
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the cost has come to $1,950.

496
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:46,918
[SPEAKER_04]: That includes the air flight, the hotels, and two meals a day, and of course, any trips or excursions that we do that's itemized here.

497
00:41:49,637 --> 00:42:09,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also, they have to have the insurance, and that's $145 extra, which they had to pay with the deposit to cover, and we asked them to take, which I guess the school committee has requested for them to take the one all-inclusive coverage, so they can cancel any time.

498
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:13,729
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we did start planning the trip, you know,

499
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:24,461
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a few months ago, so we always tell the parents, you never know what can happen from here to February, from then to February, so it's a good thing, it's a good thing to have.

500
00:42:25,322 --> 00:42:29,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and then Victoria also put down that she's had two past trips.

501
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:39,035
[SPEAKER_04]: She had the first trip was to Ecuador, and it was a success, and her last trip with the students was to the Dominican Republic, which was also a success.

502
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:40,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

503
00:42:40,698 --> 00:42:41,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

504
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mrs. Lopore, for being before us again.

505
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked through this in detail and I thought it sounded wonderfully interesting.

506
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:55,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I was going, well, I almost wish I was going until I saw you arriving at 3.45 a.m.

507
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:59,342
[SPEAKER_03]: and then on the day that you're leaving, you're departing at 4 o'clock in the morning.

508
00:43:00,042 --> 00:43:02,242
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it is not for the faint-hearted.

509
00:43:03,342 --> 00:43:05,063
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, thank you very much.

510
00:43:05,203 --> 00:43:06,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly will have my support.

511
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:12,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's kind of nice because when we arrive there, then we have the whole day, which the kids have lots of energy.

512
00:43:12,914 --> 00:43:17,297
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little tough for the staff, but somehow they keep me young.

513
00:43:17,357 --> 00:43:18,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's for sure.

514
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:19,579
[SPEAKER_04]: They keep us all going.

515
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

516
00:43:25,463 --> 00:43:26,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the report.

517
00:43:27,084 --> 00:43:29,746
[SPEAKER_14]: It says it's capped at 39, and you have 39 already?

518
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:30,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we have 39.

519
00:43:30,587 --> 00:43:31,748
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're all full.

520
00:43:32,817 --> 00:43:37,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it would become an entourage if we took any more students.

521
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,421
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time I traveled to Puerto Rico, I took 38.

522
00:43:41,922 --> 00:43:44,083
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw what that was.

523
00:43:44,103 --> 00:43:49,046
[SPEAKER_04]: The nice thing is that I always negotiate one chaperone to every six students.

524
00:43:50,147 --> 00:43:51,828
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we were able to do that.

525
00:43:56,343 --> 00:44:06,151
[SPEAKER_09]: Mrs. Rappori, part of it is I want to thank you for always giving our students this opportunity to see the world, especially with service projects.

526
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:18,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think when our children get to go and see an area, they come home a little more thankful for what they have, appreciative of their family and their education.

527
00:44:19,141 --> 00:44:22,383
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it changes who they are from that point forward.

528
00:44:22,737 --> 00:44:29,740
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's something that these 39 children will carry forward, as well as all the children you have brought before.

529
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:37,384
[SPEAKER_09]: So as a committee member, I thank you for taking our students and all the other staff members that give up their time.

530
00:44:37,744 --> 00:44:39,565
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of these days, I am going to come.

531
00:44:41,466 --> 00:44:42,806
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee member Kretz.

532
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:43,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

533
00:44:44,127 --> 00:44:47,468
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to say thank you for bringing this to us tonight.

534
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:51,030
[SPEAKER_13]: And I really like some of the highlights on the itinerary are

535
00:44:51,411 --> 00:44:55,553
[SPEAKER_13]: What I really liked was they're going to visit the local high school in La Jaws.

536
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:56,653
[SPEAKER_13]: I hope I said it right.

537
00:44:57,173 --> 00:45:01,215
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're going to volunteer at Centro San Francisco School.

538
00:45:01,795 --> 00:45:05,036
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're also going to be working in the community with Hurricane Relief.

539
00:45:05,356 --> 00:45:06,857
[SPEAKER_13]: So it just sounds incredible.

540
00:45:06,937 --> 00:45:10,358
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want you to have a great time and take lots of pictures.

541
00:45:10,438 --> 00:45:12,659
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can't wait to look forward to seeing them.

542
00:45:12,939 --> 00:45:13,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I know.

543
00:45:13,479 --> 00:45:14,760
[SPEAKER_04]: We're really excited about it.

544
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:15,120
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

545
00:45:17,421 --> 00:45:18,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my god.

546
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:19,942
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee member Ruggiero.

547
00:45:20,841 --> 00:45:28,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I just had a quick question about the statement here required to pass a criminal background check for the tour guide and the tour directors.

548
00:45:30,675 --> 00:45:33,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know anything about what type or how it's usually?

549
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the CORI?

550
00:45:35,962 --> 00:45:37,464
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so it's a CORI check usually?

551
00:45:37,996 --> 00:45:38,657
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my question.

552
00:45:38,697 --> 00:45:38,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

553
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:39,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

554
00:45:40,058 --> 00:45:40,478
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds great.

555
00:45:40,498 --> 00:45:40,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

556
00:45:40,698 --> 00:45:41,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a blast.

557
00:45:41,659 --> 00:45:41,739
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

558
00:45:41,779 --> 00:45:42,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

559
00:45:42,399 --> 00:45:43,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

560
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve by Irene B. Benedetto.

561
00:45:45,261 --> 00:45:45,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

562
00:45:45,801 --> 00:45:46,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Second by Ms.

563
00:45:46,762 --> 00:45:47,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Lucretia Van de Kloot.

564
00:45:47,642 --> 00:45:48,383
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

565
00:45:48,703 --> 00:45:48,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

566
00:45:48,903 --> 00:45:49,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

567
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:50,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a roll call.

568
00:45:50,724 --> 00:45:52,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a roll call?

569
00:45:52,325 --> 00:45:52,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

570
00:45:52,886 --> 00:45:53,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a roll call.

571
00:45:53,626 --> 00:45:53,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

572
00:45:54,107 --> 00:45:54,607
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

573
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:54,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

574
00:45:54,887 --> 00:45:55,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote it is.

575
00:45:56,568 --> 00:45:57,369
[SPEAKER_13]: Mrs. de Benedetto?

576
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:57,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

577
00:45:58,169 --> 00:45:58,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Mrs. Kretsch?

578
00:45:58,730 --> 00:45:58,890
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

579
00:45:59,090 --> 00:45:59,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Mrs. McStone?

580
00:45:59,710 --> 00:45:59,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

581
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:01,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Ruggiero?

582
00:46:01,071 --> 00:46:01,291
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

583
00:46:02,172 --> 00:46:02,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Russo?

584
00:46:02,972 --> 00:46:03,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

585
00:46:03,993 --> 00:46:04,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Mrs. Van de Kloot?

586
00:46:04,793 --> 00:46:05,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

587
00:46:05,594 --> 00:46:05,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor Burke?

588
00:46:06,595 --> 00:46:06,715
Absent.

589
00:46:08,207 --> 00:46:10,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Six yes, one absent.

590
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:10,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carries.

591
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:13,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

592
00:46:13,128 --> 00:46:13,668
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all set.

593
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:14,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Gracias.

594
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:15,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Gracias.

595
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:25,151
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to call Judith Cromer forward to present the report on the Massachusetts Safety and Justice Board.

596
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:30,912
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mr. DeLego is going to just turn this on.

597
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:42,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

598
00:46:43,021 --> 00:46:44,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me here tonight.

599
00:46:46,484 --> 00:46:53,550
[SPEAKER_00]: My name, as was mentioned, thank you, is Judy Crocker, and I work for the Massachusetts Department of Transportation's Safe Routes to School Program.

600
00:46:54,251 --> 00:47:09,544
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you do have a very strong program in Medford at most of the Medford schools, so tonight it's really periodically I feel that we should have an update just so we have new faces and we have familiar faces just so everyone can hear the same story.

601
00:47:12,965 --> 00:47:13,805
[SPEAKER_00]: just waiting for the screen.

602
00:47:13,825 --> 00:47:14,285
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.

603
00:47:15,425 --> 00:47:15,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a warm-up.

604
00:47:17,646 --> 00:47:28,708
[SPEAKER_00]: So neighborhood by neighborhood, the Safe Routes to School program has been successful in making our community's pathways and sidewalks a more attractive, safer transportation option for our students.

605
00:47:29,488 --> 00:47:34,729
[SPEAKER_00]: So the program focuses on safety, exercise, and building a sense of community.

606
00:47:35,309 --> 00:47:39,990
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been effective in increasing the number of students who walk or bike to school.

607
00:47:40,471 --> 00:47:43,574
[SPEAKER_00]: and in decreasing idling and parent traffic.

608
00:47:49,778 --> 00:47:55,923
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Safe Roads to School program is actually modeled after national and international programs.

609
00:47:56,604 --> 00:48:03,609
[SPEAKER_00]: It was originally developed in Denmark and it's in all 50 states and in about 40 countries.

610
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,452
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the celebration for Safe Walks is

611
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:13,571
[SPEAKER_00]: is Safe Routes rather, is we have different flagship type events.

612
00:48:13,651 --> 00:48:17,713
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just had our International Walk to School Day celebrating just that fact.

613
00:48:19,213 --> 00:48:25,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is an active program in about 56% of Massachusetts schools.

614
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:34,157
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of the outreach coordinator model, we have six different coordinators.

615
00:48:35,218 --> 00:48:36,438
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in the pink right here.

616
00:48:36,978 --> 00:48:39,119
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a very robust marketing department.

617
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:50,262
[SPEAKER_00]: So the program is very flexible in that it can be tailored to really meet whatever the local needs are.

618
00:48:51,322 --> 00:48:53,583
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I mentioned physical activity.

619
00:48:54,063 --> 00:48:58,424
[SPEAKER_00]: We can focus on safety, traffic congestion, the environment in general.

620
00:48:58,704 --> 00:49:00,705
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all talking about carbon footprints these days.

621
00:49:01,827 --> 00:49:04,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Attendance is more of a priority in some districts.

622
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:15,977
[SPEAKER_00]: And just communicating this part of this behavior modification and changing levels of expectations for parents, students, and the community in general.

623
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:20,880
[SPEAKER_00]: So the program is based on what we call the six Es.

624
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:27,584
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyone who's familiar with the Complete Streets type of policies

625
00:49:29,244 --> 00:49:31,185
[SPEAKER_00]: they follow about the same type of outline.

626
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:33,286
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go over these today.

627
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:37,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Equity, I'd just like to mention, is kind of the umbrella that covers everything.

628
00:49:41,470 --> 00:49:48,693
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do evaluations, we're looking for quantifiable data so that we can actually look at some trends.

629
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:51,915
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that we are having success.

630
00:49:52,395 --> 00:49:55,276
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have different type of parent surveys.

631
00:49:56,057 --> 00:49:58,558
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do walkability or bikeability assessments.

632
00:49:59,399 --> 00:50:02,080
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field, in the neighborhoods, as well as on school property.

633
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:14,925
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have our flagship events, once or twice a year we do ask that the schools do a tally, similar to when lunch attendance is taken in the morning.

634
00:50:16,026 --> 00:50:21,068
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for a three-day set of tallies, usually done in the classroom by the classroom teacher.

635
00:50:21,688 --> 00:50:27,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this helps us determine how well we're doing in a trend.

636
00:50:29,468 --> 00:50:32,110
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example of what one of the surveys looks like.

637
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:36,933
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the products that comes with the survey is called the walking shed.

638
00:50:37,413 --> 00:50:42,817
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the dark purple in the middle is a half mile out from the school, and the lighter purple is one mile out.

639
00:50:43,177 --> 00:50:54,184
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can, it's just a different way of seeing where the students live, what parts of town they live in around that school, and how they are getting to school.

640
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,241
[SPEAKER_00]: So education is a large component of our program.

641
00:51:01,242 --> 00:51:05,043
[SPEAKER_00]: We have many different levels of curriculum.

642
00:51:06,384 --> 00:51:10,926
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common that we help with are pedestrian safety and bike safety.

643
00:51:11,566 --> 00:51:20,850
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a very robust mentoring program that we use for older children to teach the younger students, particularly in the middle school level, teaching the younger kids.

644
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:26,252
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a number of particularly sixth grade curriculums.

645
00:51:26,734 --> 00:51:35,347
[SPEAKER_00]: And all our curriculums meet state frameworks for either health and wellness, science, math, and social studies.

646
00:51:38,251 --> 00:51:38,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Encouragement.

647
00:51:40,346 --> 00:51:43,287
[SPEAKER_00]: we try to celebrate how our students are getting to school.

648
00:51:43,587 --> 00:51:49,428
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love this picture, and I give a shout out to Sarah Winefield in the audience from the Roberts School.

649
00:51:49,788 --> 00:51:53,049
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Crazy Sock Day at the Roberts School this past spring.

650
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:58,850
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see, it's very simple how we can celebrate how the kids are getting to school.

651
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:03,531
[SPEAKER_00]: We have theme days, as this is.

652
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:08,172
[SPEAKER_00]: We have walk-in school buses, which is, it's really just a current term

653
00:52:10,066 --> 00:52:17,449
[SPEAKER_00]: When most of us as adults in the room were growing up, if you were walking to school, you just stopped at a friend's house, picked them up, and then so on and so forth.

654
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:18,469
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the same thing.

655
00:52:18,929 --> 00:52:20,950
[SPEAKER_00]: And today they just call them walking school buses.

656
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:31,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Park and walk is if parents need to drive to school, because sometimes it's reality today.

657
00:52:33,155 --> 00:52:34,795
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the way it is.

658
00:52:36,016 --> 00:52:38,697
[SPEAKER_00]: We can work with the communities to

659
00:52:39,524 --> 00:52:53,420
[SPEAKER_00]: try to alleviate some of that parent traffic on school campus or around school campus and have kind of remote areas where the parents can either park and walk the students in or if the students are older, they can park and drop the students off.

660
00:52:55,842 --> 00:52:59,186
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do also work a lot with enforcements.

661
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:02,954
[SPEAKER_00]: between crossing guards, police, school resource officers.

662
00:53:03,454 --> 00:53:11,676
[SPEAKER_00]: We have training videos and pamphlets available for crossing guards in both English and Spanish.

663
00:53:12,717 --> 00:53:23,980
[SPEAKER_00]: We work a lot with school traffic plans, which would be the flow of pedestrian, bicycle, school bus and vehicle traffic on school property.

664
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:27,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Arrival dismissal plans is another way of looking at it.

665
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:34,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Engineering goes with infrastructure or non-infrastructure.

666
00:53:34,657 --> 00:53:37,920
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the infrastructure, it would be what you expect.

667
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:45,826
[SPEAKER_00]: The type of signage used is particularly important, as well as basic safety enhancements and no idling.

668
00:53:46,787 --> 00:53:50,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Infrastructure or non-infrastructure, rather, would be the task force.

669
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:56,476
[SPEAKER_00]: The one unique thing about Safe Routes to School program and something that is often

670
00:53:57,009 --> 00:54:05,873
[SPEAKER_00]: misunderstood is that you can't, schools and the municipal government, they each can't stay in their lane when it comes to something like Safer to School.

671
00:54:07,654 --> 00:54:10,375
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the students get to school, they're crossing municipal property.

672
00:54:10,415 --> 00:54:12,556
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they get to school, they're on school property.

673
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:14,717
[SPEAKER_00]: But both sides have to work together.

674
00:54:15,237 --> 00:54:18,638
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, the majority of schools in the U.S.

675
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:24,321
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have signage which is actually enforceable by the police because it's not regulatory.

676
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:26,682
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy anything when you're on

677
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:29,093
[SPEAKER_00]: public road, everything is regulatory.

678
00:54:29,113 --> 00:54:31,975
[SPEAKER_00]: But on school property, it tends not to be the case.

679
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:32,996
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just one example.

680
00:54:35,418 --> 00:54:36,799
[SPEAKER_00]: So where is Medford today?

681
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:40,182
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've had a partner school for a number of years now.

682
00:54:40,762 --> 00:54:47,988
[SPEAKER_00]: And a partner school is simply signing a piece of paper saying that you want to have a safer school program.

683
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:57,010
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very simple form, but by signing up as a partner school, it puts you in line for any grant funding that we may have.

684
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:00,875
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Brooks School was very fortunate.

685
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:05,241
[SPEAKER_00]: major infrastructure grant a few years ago, which is in progress.

686
00:55:06,081 --> 00:55:19,386
[SPEAKER_00]: The Roberts School, that survey that we mentioned earlier, part of the evaluation process, they had more than 50% of their students, or rather parents, participate this past spring, so they earned themselves a $250 gift certificate.

687
00:55:21,455 --> 00:55:22,556
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to the Roberts School.

688
00:55:23,657 --> 00:55:27,639
[SPEAKER_00]: They also asked us to suggest some traffic flow improvements this past spring.

689
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:33,183
[SPEAKER_00]: And Walk Medford is actually represented tonight, and they are a very strong advocate of this program.

690
00:55:36,145 --> 00:55:37,667
[SPEAKER_00]: So where do we go from here?

691
00:55:38,967 --> 00:55:42,970
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to jumpstart the program at the Andrews Middle School.

692
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:46,753
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a partner school, but it's been a little quiet there for a while.

693
00:55:47,601 --> 00:55:56,429
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have two schools that are not signed up to receive the benefits of the program, which are the McGlynn two schools.

694
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:05,418
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the advantage of having all your schools signed up is, as I mentioned, the complete streets policy.

695
00:56:05,898 --> 00:56:08,941
[SPEAKER_00]: Most complete streets policies for the towns and cities

696
00:56:10,862 --> 00:56:17,545
[SPEAKER_00]: They all circle around pedestrian and bicycle safety and transportation modes.

697
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:21,906
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, quite honestly, that's where the funding is today.

698
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:25,287
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the federal funding is now through Complete Streets.

699
00:56:25,908 --> 00:56:38,732
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a large check mark off one of those boxes when a Complete Streets grant application is filled out if it says are all your schools partnered with the Safe Roads Program.

700
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:50,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of your schools, at least when you go on the website or even in the handbooks, they don't have uniform arrival-dismissal plans.

701
00:56:52,288 --> 00:57:04,397
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, again, further working with each school to see how your needs, because needs change, and each school has a different geographic footprint, if you would, and would have different challenges, and with that, successes.

702
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:11,346
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always like to end with something about the kids, because that's why we're all here.

703
00:57:12,246 --> 00:57:15,208
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to celebrate our student commuters, and they are commuters.

704
00:57:16,229 --> 00:57:22,032
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is just one of the celebratory things that many schools might do.

705
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:23,133
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple.

706
00:57:23,953 --> 00:57:26,194
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like your crazy socks.

707
00:57:26,214 --> 00:57:28,376
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something where the kids can all participate.

708
00:57:28,616 --> 00:57:30,757
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how they get to school, we just want them to be safe.

709
00:57:34,238 --> 00:57:35,059
[SPEAKER_00]: and have some fun with it.

710
00:57:35,399 --> 00:57:51,648
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to introduce Sarah McGiven, who works for the Department of Public Health here in Medford, and the Mass in Motion coordinator, and also Todd Blake, who is the town engineer.

711
00:57:52,449 --> 00:57:53,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

712
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:55,591
[SPEAKER_06]: I did see two of my girls.

713
00:57:55,651 --> 00:57:57,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw their Darth Vader and Penguin socks.

714
00:57:58,712 --> 00:58:00,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

715
00:58:00,093 --> 00:58:02,153
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called celebs and we didn't even know it.

716
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:08,976
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a few handouts that I will leave over here.

717
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:11,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mrs. Mistone.

718
00:58:13,497 --> 00:58:16,898
[SPEAKER_09]: There was no mention of the Columbus School in the presentation.

719
00:58:16,958 --> 00:58:18,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we going to try to get them on board as well?

720
00:58:19,578 --> 00:58:20,958
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the Columbus Apartment School.

721
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:22,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, so you.

722
00:58:22,779 --> 00:58:27,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, I'm Saran McGiver, and I'm the Mass in Motion coordinator for the city of Medford.

723
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,141
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm based in the Board of Health upstairs.

724
00:58:30,061 --> 00:58:38,643
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've been working here since 2012 on initiatives related to getting people access to food and physical activity.

725
00:58:38,663 --> 00:58:43,304
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm 100% funded by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

726
00:58:45,700 --> 00:59:00,004
[SPEAKER_11]: The state really wants to see me and other Mass In Motion communities in the state working on initiatives that are sustainable in our communities, changing systems, changing the environment, and changing policies to improve our health.

727
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:04,025
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm also a Medford resident, and my son goes to the Roberts School.

728
00:59:05,586 --> 00:59:12,968
[SPEAKER_11]: So I passed out, sorry, I didn't have one for everyone in the room, but I passed out a chart that has more detail about each school's participation.

729
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:31,541
[SPEAKER_11]: And I and other members from WAC Medford and our city transportation engineer, Todd, who is here and will come up and talk in a moment as well, are all here to help work with Judy and to help the schools advance the Secrets to School programming.

730
00:59:34,412 --> 00:59:45,396
[SPEAKER_11]: wanted to highlight in there that the Brooks School did get a $1 million grant for improvements around the school because of some parents who applied for the grant in 2013.

731
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:50,157
[SPEAKER_11]: And we intend for the Roberts School to be the next school to apply for the funding.

732
00:59:50,177 --> 00:59:54,479
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still waiting for the state to release the information about the details.

733
00:59:55,359 --> 01:00:03,522
[SPEAKER_11]: We have heard that for years they've been saying that they're going to update the process and give us some information about how to apply, and we're hoping that

734
01:00:04,348 --> 01:00:08,549
[SPEAKER_11]: will have the opportunity to get the same amount of funding that the Brooks got.

735
01:00:09,529 --> 01:00:12,910
[SPEAKER_11]: So does anyone have any questions?

736
01:00:14,591 --> 01:00:17,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to mention that last year, I think it was myself and Ms.

737
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:24,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Kretz, Kathy, were able to attend one of the wonderful events at the Roberts School.

738
01:00:24,073 --> 01:00:25,013
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really fun.

739
01:00:25,093 --> 01:00:26,573
[SPEAKER_03]: It was joyous to be there.

740
01:00:26,593 --> 01:00:28,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And the kids were having fun.

741
01:00:28,754 --> 01:00:32,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And clearly, it was a very positive start to their day.

742
01:00:32,775 --> 01:00:33,615
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is great.

743
01:00:33,655 --> 01:00:36,096
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank you for the presentation tonight.

744
01:00:36,476 --> 01:00:46,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I sort of have a feeling that we might be able to reach out to our new principal at the McGlynn and perhaps working together, we can get them involved as well.

745
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:48,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

746
01:00:48,439 --> 01:00:49,539
[SPEAKER_06]: School committee member Ruggiero.

747
01:00:50,199 --> 01:00:52,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, thank you for putting together this report.

748
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:57,801
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a question about the actual unexpected walk, bike, share table that you have here.

749
01:00:58,541 --> 01:01:00,982
[SPEAKER_14]: So how is the expected calculated?

750
01:01:02,604 --> 01:01:07,427
[SPEAKER_14]: This is, it says that we have 47% for other members.

751
01:01:08,468 --> 01:01:09,469
[SPEAKER_14]: These aren't the numbers.

752
01:01:09,689 --> 01:01:11,210
[SPEAKER_14]: This is on the GHG.

753
01:01:11,871 --> 01:01:13,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think this is Judy.

754
01:01:13,612 --> 01:01:13,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

755
01:01:25,447 --> 01:01:26,568
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you're on page three?

756
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:27,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.

757
01:01:27,548 --> 01:01:28,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the upper right.

758
01:01:29,209 --> 01:01:44,798
[SPEAKER_00]: As I understand it, the actual versus expected is that they are going for looking at that walk shed map, okay, and how many students live within half a mile, a mile, mile and a half versus two miles.

759
01:01:45,438 --> 01:01:53,863
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the upper row is broken out that way, and from that they look at

760
01:01:55,428 --> 01:01:59,191
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic implements, you know, is 93 cutting through?

761
01:01:59,211 --> 01:02:03,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have, you know, a major rotary, you know, as we do right around the corner here?

762
01:02:04,335 --> 01:02:04,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.

763
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:09,419
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that, they have an algorithm that they use.

764
01:02:09,579 --> 01:02:14,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you, when I read this through this report, I was looking for other communities.

765
01:02:15,264 --> 01:02:20,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you give us a sense of what a community like Melrose or Somerville or Arlington, what their participation rates would be?

766
01:02:21,962 --> 01:02:34,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Arlington is actually, thank you for mentioning, Arlington actually was one of the first two communities in Massachusetts through the Massachusetts Department of Transportation to start a Safe Routes to School program.

767
01:02:35,665 --> 01:02:38,445
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were kind of the original pilots, if you would.

768
01:02:39,045 --> 01:02:48,027
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, there were a number of school districts that had the program before the state did.

769
01:02:50,746 --> 01:02:54,108
[SPEAKER_00]: In my hometown, we've had it since 2004.

770
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:56,649
[SPEAKER_00]: And the state started late in 2005.

771
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:59,912
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all doing the same thing.

772
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:02,573
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, it varies.

773
01:03:03,394 --> 01:03:08,377
[SPEAKER_00]: And like anything else, the good thing about the program is that it's very flexible.

774
01:03:11,499 --> 01:03:15,061
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, there's no one model, there's no one size that fits all.

775
01:03:15,121 --> 01:03:17,563
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of that, sometimes it's hard to get your arms around.

776
01:03:17,863 --> 01:03:19,004
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some communities,

777
01:03:19,669 --> 01:03:24,193
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be organized and run through the police department and others through the PTOs.

778
01:03:24,813 --> 01:03:27,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And some it's a nursing department or gym teachers.

779
01:03:29,377 --> 01:03:39,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Some it's a local Y. So because of that, it's finding that right fit and finding how the program best works in your community and who kind of owns it.

780
01:03:40,806 --> 01:03:48,912
[SPEAKER_00]: And then part of owning it is also doing some of the troubleshooting, which is why, you know, if it lives with the nursing department,

781
01:03:49,442 --> 01:03:50,443
[SPEAKER_00]: elementary and middle schools.

782
01:03:50,843 --> 01:03:51,603
[SPEAKER_00]: That's terrific.

783
01:03:52,223 --> 01:04:03,648
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they may not be the most effective in troubleshooting this shrubbery blocking a few sidewalks or a push button on a pedestrian crossing or something like that.

784
01:04:03,908 --> 01:04:07,330
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it does take reaching across the aisle, so to speak.

785
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:11,712
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes municipal and school activity to

786
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,421
[SPEAKER_00]: make a successful program.

787
01:04:15,262 --> 01:04:31,108
[SPEAKER_14]: The line that I found most sort of interesting was the sequence that says if you live less than a mile from the school, the actual participation is 8%, but you're expecting about 30%.

788
01:04:31,628 --> 01:04:33,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you see other communities making that 30%?

789
01:04:34,089 --> 01:04:34,329
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

790
01:04:35,249 --> 01:04:38,210
[SPEAKER_14]: So what do you think makes Medford unique in this regard?

791
01:04:40,733 --> 01:04:47,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Where are we lacking, I guess, because I would love to see, you know, I think it's a great thing for kids to be able to walk to school or bike to school.

792
01:04:47,419 --> 01:04:48,359
[SPEAKER_14]: So how can we make that better?

793
01:04:48,399 --> 01:04:51,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think when you look at the chart that Ms.

794
01:04:51,582 --> 01:04:55,505
[SPEAKER_00]: McGiven put together, that's where each school is today.

795
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:56,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

796
01:04:56,686 --> 01:05:02,131
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much to put on slides, so that's why I thank her for her footwork on that.

797
01:05:05,053 --> 01:05:09,635
[SPEAKER_00]: Every school has a different geographic footprint, and so you have different neighborhoods.

798
01:05:09,935 --> 01:05:15,578
[SPEAKER_00]: Some neighborhoods, by essence of their makeup, are more walkable or bikeable than others.

799
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:17,880
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, it's better to take the school bus.

800
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:21,401
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, we just want the students to be safe.

801
01:05:22,242 --> 01:05:32,627
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's that competition, too, with especially post-2007 recession, and most people have two cars in their driveway.

802
01:05:33,867 --> 01:05:36,828
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to say that parents aren't in traffic, they are the traffic.

803
01:05:37,288 --> 01:05:44,991
[SPEAKER_00]: So our school properties, our New England roads weren't made for, and even our highways, they're all oversubscribed.

804
01:05:45,051 --> 01:05:47,712
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not, they weren't designed for this type of traffic.

805
01:05:48,072 --> 01:05:51,394
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even have parking for a lot of our faculty anymore on school property.

806
01:05:52,634 --> 01:05:55,815
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have no land left to develop for that case.

807
01:05:57,256 --> 01:06:02,718
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you just have to look in the news to see what communities are dealing with and how for the

808
01:06:03,623 --> 01:06:06,666
[SPEAKER_00]: raise in rising school population.

809
01:06:07,106 --> 01:06:13,391
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't mean not to answer, but it's almost a case by case.

810
01:06:13,991 --> 01:06:21,698
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it possible you could give us these statistics broken down by school instead of having it through the whole district, as you do here, the actual and expected?

811
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:24,300
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you looking where it's Robert's?

812
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:33,147
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm looking at the greenhouse gas admissions page and how your school compares and has actual and expected walk, bike, chair.

813
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:34,630
[SPEAKER_14]: That sequence right there?

814
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:40,811
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Safe Routes to School State Office has a tool where they can do a survey with each school, and they can give us that information.

815
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:46,412
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to go through each principal, and they do a two-week window where they have the school fill out the survey.

816
01:06:46,452 --> 01:06:53,433
[SPEAKER_11]: And if at least 50% of the school fills it out, then the Safe Routes to School program will give us a gift certificate.

817
01:06:53,473 --> 01:06:56,134
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's some sort of incentive to get people to fill it out.

818
01:06:56,174 --> 01:06:57,294
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard to get people to fill out surveys.

819
01:06:57,374 --> 01:07:02,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, once it's not, if you don't have the 50% participation rate, it doesn't necessarily get recorded.

820
01:07:03,432 --> 01:07:05,073
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just not as accurate.

821
01:07:05,153 --> 01:07:06,414
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not as accurate, I see.

822
01:07:06,454 --> 01:07:06,574
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

823
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:10,918
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and we, I mean, our survey comes in seven languages.

824
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:16,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to be user-friendly in that.

825
01:07:17,663 --> 01:07:22,567
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the greenhouse gases, another part we didn't talk about this evening is the school bus.

826
01:07:23,368 --> 01:07:28,411
[SPEAKER_00]: And one school bus equals about 36 cars, according to the Federal Safety Board.

827
01:07:29,072 --> 01:07:32,935
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's another way to lower your greenhouse gases.

828
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:37,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Idling is a significant problem in parent traffic.

829
01:07:38,916 --> 01:07:54,889
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what the temperature is outside, most of the cars are running, which is just unfortunate because it doesn't do anyone any good, particularly when New England has one of the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country, between the Gulf Stream and just life in general.

830
01:07:56,210 --> 01:08:02,954
[SPEAKER_06]: While you're here and while we're all in the same room, I do want to bring up our city engineer, Todd Ellery, who's a very active parent at the Roberts.

831
01:08:03,014 --> 01:08:03,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Sarah as well.

832
01:08:04,435 --> 01:08:13,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because I know for one of the goals for the Roberts, it says to apply for the infrastructure assessment grant from the DOT when the application comes out.

833
01:08:13,841 --> 01:08:22,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if I know that Sarah Ellery, myself, had walked around with Sergeant Harnett around the Roberts to look at all the ways that it could be improved.

834
01:08:22,226 --> 01:08:24,387
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the second time we went out with the city engineer.

835
01:08:24,407 --> 01:08:25,608
[SPEAKER_06]: The first time was just the policeman.

836
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:35,453
[SPEAKER_06]: So can you guys come up just so you can talk a little bit about, I think part of the reason not many kids walk to the Roberts is because of the fouls way.

837
01:08:38,635 --> 01:08:40,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you've been working on it for a long time, Mallory.

838
01:08:41,736 --> 01:08:43,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Todd's just got here last year, right?

839
01:08:43,216 --> 01:08:44,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to go first?

840
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:53,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the goal of all these programs are to improve and to encourage more walking rights in schools.

841
01:08:53,723 --> 01:09:04,447
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are some things that the city is taking initiative on, one of which in 2016, they passed a complete streets policy to promote non-vehicular travel.

842
01:09:04,567 --> 01:09:06,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, could you speak a little louder into the microphone?

843
01:09:07,048 --> 01:09:07,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

844
01:09:07,788 --> 01:09:17,243
[SPEAKER_08]: So the city had passed a complete streets policy in 2016 to promote non-vehicle travel and to make sure that other modes of travel are treated equally.

845
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:26,144
[SPEAKER_08]: So in terms of importance or funding, cycling or walking is treated the same as someone driving a vehicle.

846
01:09:26,184 --> 01:09:33,507
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's to show that the community is aware and promoting this sort of thing.

847
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:39,389
[SPEAKER_08]: And this feeds into, as well as the Safer Sleuth Program, feeds into promoting that type of atmosphere.

848
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:49,172
[SPEAKER_08]: The Brooks School is a good example of this program leading to $1 million in funding to improve transportation along High Street.

849
01:09:49,972 --> 01:09:56,973
[SPEAKER_08]: In that program, as someone mentioned, I've only been here for six months, so I wasn't here when all that was started, so I can't take credit for any of that.

850
01:09:59,013 --> 01:10:07,715
[SPEAKER_08]: But it just goes to show you that through that process, through the Safe Routes School process, a bunch of locations were identified that could be improved.

851
01:10:08,576 --> 01:10:18,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And the city usually tries to, this program in the city, tries to match the appropriate funding with the appropriate location and tries to piece together, you know, hopefully we can improve all those locations that are identified.

852
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:30,745
[SPEAKER_08]: example, the Brooks School, they had to choose a particular corridor that the state would focus on and they provided $1 million for High Street.

853
01:10:31,225 --> 01:10:33,706
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not to say that other improvements aren't going on.

854
01:10:34,766 --> 01:10:38,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe there's a community block grant program here at Brooks School to

855
01:10:39,308 --> 01:10:46,412
[SPEAKER_08]: repave Auburn Street, which is adjacent to the school, and that's also improving Auburn at Prescott Street.

856
01:10:46,432 --> 01:10:53,036
[SPEAKER_08]: So it just goes to show you, these things could lead to other programs and projects that could help promote walking.

857
01:10:53,076 --> 01:11:07,044
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have been welcomed into the community with a walk, Manfred and others, and I've participated in walks to school with the kids, particularly Robert's school, and we identified some locations that could be improved.

858
01:11:08,946 --> 01:11:26,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing I want to point out is recently at a city council meeting, the city council approved the transfer of funds from Uber and Lyft monies that the city received to pedestrian improvements, and that included 21 locations, and some of those locations

859
01:11:27,421 --> 01:11:37,826
[SPEAKER_08]: will directly improve existing pedestrian crossings for the Robert School, Columbus School, and some other schools along Freedom Way as well.

860
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:46,290
[SPEAKER_08]: So eventually, we'll piece together all these different funding sources to improve walking and walking to school for those kids.

861
01:11:46,871 --> 01:11:48,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm sorry.

862
01:11:48,711 --> 01:11:49,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you want to speak something?

863
01:11:50,548 --> 01:11:53,750
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to, I think this report is great.

864
01:11:54,090 --> 01:12:01,214
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there is a huge potential, especially at that under one mile mark, to improve the participation in this program.

865
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:06,818
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you so much for bringing all the hard work and bringing this program forward to us.

866
01:12:07,118 --> 01:12:11,160
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just say briefly, I've been involved with the walk to school at Roberts since it started.

867
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:15,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Jen Lewis was the parent that started the program, and I've been a walk leader.

868
01:12:15,443 --> 01:12:19,385
[SPEAKER_05]: And Sarah Reinfeld has done an excellent job continuing the leadership of the program at the Roberts.

869
01:12:20,287 --> 01:12:27,809
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can say that just with the fall weather, this is now the fourth year we've done walk to school, I think, fourth?

870
01:12:28,809 --> 01:12:36,572
[SPEAKER_05]: And on nice days in the fall as school started, I really felt like there's like three times as many kids walking to school on a nice day.

871
01:12:37,212 --> 01:12:40,553
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just been effective.

872
01:12:40,933 --> 01:12:44,774
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like from what I was just seeing, you're seeing a lot more kids walk to school.

873
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:49,255
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Jen said one of the first things that happened when people started walking to school was parents

874
01:12:49,852 --> 01:12:52,854
[SPEAKER_05]: kids saying like, oh wow, like a half mile really isn't that far.

875
01:12:52,874 --> 01:13:03,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I never thought I could walk to school and all of a sudden they realize they can actually walk a half a mile and it's not that far and it's actually really fun and really starts the day off nicely.

876
01:13:03,262 --> 01:13:07,926
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's just been a great program to see grow and change attitudes already.

877
01:13:08,543 --> 01:13:10,705
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I wanted to say.

878
01:13:11,425 --> 01:13:12,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

879
01:13:13,387 --> 01:13:16,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have one question because I think maybe one of you might know this.

880
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:20,873
[SPEAKER_03]: On Playstead Road, all of a sudden there was a stencil of a bicycle.

881
01:13:21,574 --> 01:13:25,177
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not a bicycle lane, it's going down the middle of the road.

882
01:13:25,617 --> 01:13:32,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've had people ask me if I understand why, rather than Everett Bicycle Lane, we have the stencil in the middle of the road.

883
01:13:32,444 --> 01:13:33,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you know the answer?

884
01:13:33,765 --> 01:13:33,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

885
01:13:34,305 --> 01:13:35,266
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great question.

886
01:13:36,107 --> 01:13:42,333
[SPEAKER_08]: So besides Walk Medford, I've also been welcomed into the Medford Bicycle Commission community.

887
01:13:44,555 --> 01:13:50,860
[SPEAKER_08]: That bicycle commission developed a document, a master plan for bicycle improvements and accommodations throughout the city.

888
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:59,966
[SPEAKER_08]: So in that document, they identify some streets that they foresee bike lanes on and some that they foresee just sharrows is what the other symbol is.

889
01:14:00,286 --> 01:14:08,592
[SPEAKER_08]: So sharrows is just meant to be a symbol to remind drivers and others that bicycles could occupy the entire lane.

890
01:14:08,992 --> 01:14:14,457
[SPEAKER_08]: and working with the city's bike commission, some other cities you might see them off to the right in the lane.

891
01:14:15,037 --> 01:14:24,865
[SPEAKER_08]: And our Medford Bike Commission prefers them to be in the center lane because it reinforces the notion that they could take the entire lane if they wanted to, because bicycles are treated with the same regulations as vehicles.

892
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:30,510
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they're in the right hand, there's a door zone to contend with and things like that.

893
01:14:30,851 --> 01:14:35,294
[SPEAKER_08]: So on streets where we can't fit a full bicycle lane or

894
01:14:36,355 --> 01:14:42,978
[SPEAKER_08]: it hasn't been, you know, allocated in the master plan that that's what they'd want, then a share.

895
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:48,220
[SPEAKER_08]: As we repave streets and other projects come up, we try to add them whenever possible.

896
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:52,181
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was through some recent repaving efforts, we were able to add those.

897
01:14:52,641 --> 01:14:55,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I will spread the word.

898
01:14:55,202 --> 01:14:56,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

899
01:14:56,323 --> 01:14:56,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

900
01:14:57,363 --> 01:15:01,665
[SPEAKER_11]: One is you have a flyer about bike rodeo in there, which is a bike safety

901
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:07,560
[SPEAKER_11]: teaching event to teach learning bicyclists and it's really fun.

902
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:09,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Judy does an excellent job setting it up.

903
01:15:09,784 --> 01:15:13,251
[SPEAKER_11]: She uses cones, signs, teaches kids about

904
01:15:13,776 --> 01:15:16,718
[SPEAKER_11]: all kinds of safety and uses stuffed animals and makes it really fun.

905
01:15:16,838 --> 01:15:18,299
[SPEAKER_11]: It actually had to be canceled.

906
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:21,322
[SPEAKER_11]: That event was supposed to be over the weekend, had to be canceled because of rain.

907
01:15:21,702 --> 01:15:22,823
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're looking to reschedule it.

908
01:15:22,843 --> 01:15:29,008
[SPEAKER_11]: So if anyone has any ideas of a good time to do it, we like to pair it up with another community event to ensure good attendance.

909
01:15:29,128 --> 01:15:30,469
[SPEAKER_11]: Please get in touch.

910
01:15:31,469 --> 01:15:42,578
[SPEAKER_11]: And also, I just wanted to mention that in terms of making Safe Routes to School sustainable, we have to think about ways to kind of fold it into the process of the work that you're already doing, for example,

911
01:15:43,361 --> 01:15:50,511
[SPEAKER_11]: getting it into the wellness policy or working with PTOs to get a PTO representative from the schools to be in charge of Safe Routes to School.

912
01:15:50,531 --> 01:15:55,177
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's like a duty that gets carried on even after a family graduates from school.

913
01:15:55,537 --> 01:15:57,059
[SPEAKER_11]: There are a lot of other examples, too.

914
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,461
[SPEAKER_11]: So thanks for your time.

915
01:15:58,561 --> 01:15:58,802
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

916
01:15:58,842 --> 01:15:59,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

917
01:16:01,022 --> 01:16:02,503
[SPEAKER_08]: One more note about the Brooks School.

918
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:19,010
[SPEAKER_08]: So MassDOT will be conducting a design public hearing at some time soon, hopefully conducted in that particular neighborhood, which is basically an opportunity for MassDOT to present the plan as it currently stands to the community to accept comments.

919
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:21,351
[SPEAKER_08]: So that should be coming up soon.

920
01:16:21,391 --> 01:16:29,715
[SPEAKER_08]: And related to the bike discussion, the current plan does show a bike lane in one direction and Shero's in the other.

921
01:16:32,113 --> 01:16:37,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

922
01:16:37,335 --> 01:16:43,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like a motion to approve the mass use of safe routes to school.

923
01:16:44,118 --> 01:16:45,839
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

924
01:16:46,059 --> 01:16:46,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

925
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:47,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion carries.

926
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:51,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

927
01:16:51,531 --> 01:16:56,755
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to call the following people forward to report on our coordinated program review.

928
01:16:57,355 --> 01:17:00,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Kathy Medaglio, who's our Director of Pupil Services.

929
01:17:01,218 --> 01:17:04,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul DeLeva, Headmaster of the High School.

930
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:10,564
[SPEAKER_15]: Paul Texterra, who is our Director of English Language Learners, English Learners.

931
01:17:11,104 --> 01:17:16,388
[SPEAKER_15]: And Chad Fallon, who is our Headmaster Principal at the Vocational School.

932
01:17:22,923 --> 01:17:24,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, good evening everyone.

933
01:17:24,384 --> 01:17:29,549
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very pleased to be here today to report on our most recent Coordinated Program Review.

934
01:17:30,629 --> 01:17:34,252
[SPEAKER_16]: We are very pleased with the overall outcome of this evaluation.

935
01:17:35,513 --> 01:17:49,265
[SPEAKER_16]: Each year the Department of Ed identifies school districts to participate in the Coordinated Program Review system, and each district goes through this process every six years.

936
01:17:51,054 --> 01:18:07,506
[SPEAKER_16]: During the visit, the team comes through and they're taking a look at special education, they're looking at civil rights requirements, English learner education programs, and the CVTE programs over at the vocational school.

937
01:18:08,547 --> 01:18:16,753
[SPEAKER_16]: Several of the requirements cross over between different programs, which is why the Department of Ed chooses to review all of these programs simultaneously.

938
01:18:17,818 --> 01:18:24,142
[SPEAKER_16]: The process itself is a very, very long and substantive review of programs.

939
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:32,548
[SPEAKER_16]: They're looking at how a district implements all of the requirements that are laid out by both state and federal law.

940
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:38,212
[SPEAKER_16]: The process begins more than a year prior to the visiting team's arrival.

941
01:18:39,393 --> 01:18:44,897
[SPEAKER_16]: We receive booklets that indicate all of the areas that the Department of Ed will be looking at.

942
01:18:46,799 --> 01:18:48,900
[SPEAKER_16]: Each department engages in self-study.

943
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,801
[SPEAKER_16]: We review each of the requirements.

944
01:18:51,582 --> 01:19:04,490
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to prepare a substantial amount of documentation to send to the Department of Ed, which we either send to them manually or we upload into their web-based evaluation system.

945
01:19:05,410 --> 01:19:11,494
[SPEAKER_16]: They ask for all sorts of information, student enrollment demographics, teacher licensure.

946
01:19:12,295 --> 01:19:13,836
[SPEAKER_16]: They may ask for sample forms.

947
01:19:14,512 --> 01:19:19,897
[SPEAKER_16]: They're looking for notices that go out to families, advertisement for student events.

948
01:19:20,477 --> 01:19:23,500
[SPEAKER_16]: They're looking at translated documents.

949
01:19:24,581 --> 01:19:32,328
[SPEAKER_16]: They look at whether there's equity in services across different programs, such as, say, some of the vocational shops.

950
01:19:32,368 --> 01:19:40,295
[SPEAKER_16]: They may be looking at if there's representation for the school district across what our demographics look like for students.

951
01:19:41,811 --> 01:19:46,535
[SPEAKER_16]: evident in the enrollment in, say, the shops or other programs, et cetera.

952
01:19:47,676 --> 01:19:53,621
[SPEAKER_16]: So then the Department of Ed asks us for targeted information after they have a chance to review what we upload.

953
01:19:54,381 --> 01:19:57,023
[SPEAKER_16]: They then come out to visit us.

954
01:19:57,484 --> 01:20:00,046
[SPEAKER_16]: They walk around to each of the buildings.

955
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:02,748
[SPEAKER_16]: They visit classrooms, interview staff.

956
01:20:03,288 --> 01:20:05,150
[SPEAKER_16]: They interview parents and students.

957
01:20:06,213 --> 01:20:17,496
[SPEAKER_16]: They took a look at the classroom facilities to make sure that where program classrooms are located is equitable compared to all other students in each of the buildings.

958
01:20:19,316 --> 01:20:34,700
[SPEAKER_16]: They're looking at assessment of students, student identification and program placement, parent and community involvement, curriculum and instruction, student support services, faculty, staff, and administration, facilities, program evaluation,

959
01:20:35,612 --> 01:20:37,897
[SPEAKER_16]: recordkeeping, and fund use.

960
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:41,865
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's quite a comprehensive review of programs.
