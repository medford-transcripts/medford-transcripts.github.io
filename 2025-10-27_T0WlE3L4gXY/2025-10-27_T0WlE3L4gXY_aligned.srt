So we have 11 present, 4 absent.

72
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:01,272

73
00:32:01,532 --> 00:32:02,232
We can continue.

74
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:04,313
OK.

75
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:08,155
First item on the agenda is approval of the September 15, 2025 SBC meeting minutes.

76
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:15,106
Is there a motion to approve?

77
00:32:15,126 --> 00:32:16,486
So moved.

78
00:32:17,107 --> 00:32:18,307
By Mayor Longo Kern.

79
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:19,908
Is there a second?

80
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,549
Second.

81
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:24,010
Second by Maria Dorsey.

82
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,811
I will call the roll.

83
00:32:26,971 --> 00:32:27,831

84
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:29,052
Mayor Longo Kern, yes.

85
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:30,413

86
00:32:30,493 --> 00:32:32,594
Marta Cabral, Libby Brown, yes.

87
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:34,074
Marissa Desmond.

88
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:35,975
Oh, she might be here.

89
00:32:36,636 --> 00:32:38,036
She's listed as Marissa on here.

90
00:32:38,116 --> 00:32:38,877
Oh, okay.

91
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:39,777
Bring her in.

92
00:32:49,463 --> 00:32:49,863
She's done.

93
00:32:50,484 --> 00:32:51,264
Hi, thank you.

94
00:32:51,464 --> 00:32:51,904
I'm here.

95
00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:52,945
And yes.

96
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:54,346
Okay.

97
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:55,627

100
00:32:58,709 --> 00:32:59,009
Yes.

101
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:00,270
Tracy Keene.

102
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:00,550
Yes.

103
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:01,370
Emily Lazaro.

104
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:01,751
Yes.

105
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:03,251
Pomerale is absent.

106
00:33:03,271 --> 00:33:04,292
Aaron Lopate.

107
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:05,353
Yes.

108
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:05,953
Pricer.

109
00:33:06,493 --> 00:33:07,134
Yes.

110
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:07,874
Joe Bowen.

111
00:33:08,014 --> 00:33:08,355
Yes.

112
00:33:09,135 --> 00:33:09,936
Ken Lord.

113
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:10,236
Yes.

114
00:33:15,882 --> 00:33:20,143
14 in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

115
00:33:21,783 --> 00:33:22,663
That's our vote.

116
00:33:24,884 --> 00:33:30,945
Okay, next we have approval of the September 2025 OPM invoice.

117
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:35,706
Jen, did you want to introduce this in the financial piece before we vote?

118
00:33:36,266 --> 00:33:37,506
Yes, perfect.

119
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:43,667
Yes, so you can see on the screen, there is one left field invoice, number four.

120
00:33:44,637 --> 00:33:48,479
We have $20,000 for September 2025 services.

121
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:53,141
The next piece I'll show you how it factors into the budget.

122
00:33:57,383 --> 00:33:58,743
Well, it says.

123
00:33:59,383 --> 00:34:04,085
You're going to trust me on those little gadget eyeballs.

124
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:04,646
Exactly.

125
00:34:04,686 --> 00:34:05,966
So we are 18% committed.

126
00:34:08,904 --> 00:34:10,605
and 3% spent to date.

127
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,046
The actual spent to date so far is $95,000.

128
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:18,188
That includes if we approve the next invoice.

129
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:31,334
And so that would leave us with... Yes, I will need to update this document.

130
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:32,674
Sorry about that.

131
00:34:32,815 --> 00:34:36,956
So we are 18% committed and 3% spent to date, including the $20,000.

132
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:44,771
We are on target with our fee proposal as it was approved.

133
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,375
And so there's been no amendments or anything like that.

134
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:50,336
We're still just at the base contract.

135
00:34:51,477 --> 00:34:54,900
And so on a monthly basis, we'll approve these invoices.

136
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,142
Is there a motion to approve?

137
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:00,846
So moved.

138
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:03,388
Dr. Galluzzi, is there a second?

139
00:35:03,648 --> 00:35:03,968
Second.

140
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:05,470
Aaron?

141
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:06,892
Call the roll.

142
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:07,692
Jenny Graham.

143
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,132
Yes.

144
00:35:08,292 --> 00:35:09,233
Mayor Longo Kern.

145
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:09,673
Yes.

146
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:10,653
Dr. Galussi.

147
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:11,073
Yes.

148
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:11,993
Marta Cabral.

149
00:35:12,013 --> 00:35:12,233
Yes.

150
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:13,114
Libby Brown.

151
00:35:13,214 --> 00:35:13,414
Yes.

152
00:35:13,714 --> 00:35:14,574
Marissa Desmond.

153
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:15,174
Yes.

154
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:17,235
Maria Dorsey.

155
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:17,635
Yes.

156
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:18,395
Brian Hilliard.

157
00:35:18,615 --> 00:35:18,835
Yes.

158
00:35:19,415 --> 00:35:20,075
Tracy Keene.

159
00:35:20,195 --> 00:35:20,455
Yes.

160
00:35:20,756 --> 00:35:21,556
Emily Lazaro.

161
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:21,896
Yes.

162
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:23,236
Nicole Morales-Obson.

163
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:24,096
Aaron Olopade.

164
00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:24,376
Yes.

165
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:25,557
Luke Kreisner.

166
00:35:25,837 --> 00:35:26,057
Yes.

167
00:35:26,497 --> 00:35:27,257
Joan Bowen.

168
00:35:27,357 --> 00:35:27,597
Yes.

169
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:28,797
And Ken Lord.

170
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:29,078
Yes.

171
00:35:29,778 --> 00:35:30,178
Okay.

172
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:30,618
So

173
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:36,029
The invoice is approved by a vote of 14.

174
00:35:36,149 --> 00:35:38,631
And the affirmatives are negative, one absent.

175
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:42,395
Just, sorry, make one more comment about this.

176
00:35:42,955 --> 00:35:52,504
When you do see it on your own computers in the presentation, the total project budget on the left-hand side, those are the numbers that the MSBA had given to us.

177
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:58,449
Once the designer contract is committed officially and approved,

178
00:35:58,971 --> 00:36:06,733
we will be working with the MSBA to align the budget line items so that everything matches up to what we've approved.

179
00:36:07,654 --> 00:36:09,034
Great, thank you.

180
00:36:09,914 --> 00:36:19,917
We did meet with the left field team last week or the week before to just sort of hash out the invoice cycle payments that begin with us approving here.

181
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:23,458
But then there's a whole series of steps that have to be taken.

182
00:36:23,478 --> 00:36:26,259
So we're working all of that out now when the invoice is

183
00:36:27,203 --> 00:36:35,605
view because that won't last forever, but trying to make sure that we've got the right visibility for you all in this project budget update.

184
00:36:35,965 --> 00:36:51,427
So if there's anything that you want to be able to see in this project budget update that you're not able to see when you can see it, please let me know because we can work on evolving this to make sure it is meeting our needs.

185
00:36:55,578 --> 00:37:01,499
On to item number four, most of the meeting we're going to spend today talking about the designer selection panel.

186
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:08,081
And I'm super excited that you all will get to meet the selected designer today.

187
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:13,762
And they have a presentation to share with all of us about what happens next, what comes next, and all that good stuff.

188
00:37:13,822 --> 00:37:19,703
But I think Jen has a handful of slides just to frame what has been happening since our last meeting.

189
00:37:19,723 --> 00:37:20,763
So I will turn it over to you.

190
00:37:20,783 --> 00:37:22,203
Fantastic.

191
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,964
So since we last met,

192
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:31,069
I think everyone remembers we went through the proposals that were submitted for designers submitted proposals.

193
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:46,561
We went into the first designer selection panel meeting and the DSP members, as you probably remember, we had three local members and the rest of the DSP had 13 members.

194
00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:50,704
So there was a 16 member board that met twice.

195
00:37:50,884 --> 00:37:53,406
The first time was to review all four proposals.

196
00:37:54,651 --> 00:38:01,314
In that first meeting, you can see on the screen how the DSP, the full DSP, ranked the four firms.

197
00:38:02,075 --> 00:38:05,997
AI3 and SMMA were tied for first place in that first meeting.

198
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:15,881
Perkins & Will was next, so second, and DLR Group plus Jonathan Levy Architects was last.

199
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:19,103
At the end of that meeting, the DSP,

200
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:24,019
voted to interview three firms at that following meeting, which is typical.

201
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:34,068
And so in the second meeting, we had AI3, Ferguson Well, and SMMA were the interviews in that order.

202
00:38:34,968 --> 00:38:39,572
And as noted here, the votes from that first meeting did not carry over.

203
00:38:39,752 --> 00:38:42,835
So this was a new vote from the DSP.

204
00:38:43,776 --> 00:38:47,759
They voted SMMA first, which is why you see them here tonight.

205
00:38:48,632 --> 00:38:57,796
AI3 second, and Perkins and Will last, and as noted on the bottom, contract negotiations are ongoing to make sure everything aligns with our budget.

206
00:38:59,697 --> 00:39:11,822
And with that, I think we do have the SMMA team here tonight, and they have a presentation prepared to introduce themselves, review their work, and I will hand it over to them.

207
00:39:12,162 --> 00:39:12,602
That's all right.

208
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:18,860
Would it be helpful if we all introduce ourselves briefly to the SMA team now that we're at this portion of the meeting?

209
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,321
That'd be wonderful.

210
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:23,462
So why don't we start here in the room.

211
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:28,964
Actually, before we do that, our folks on Zoom, can you hear us OK?

212
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:29,665
Is this?

213
00:39:30,045 --> 00:39:31,125
Yes, perfect.

214
00:39:31,706 --> 00:39:31,926
Perfect.

215
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:32,926
Yes, we can.

216
00:39:32,986 --> 00:39:33,547
Amazing.

217
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:34,827
So many thanks to Ken.

218
00:39:41,524 --> 00:39:42,565
We're making this happen.

219
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:53,291
So the accommodations are not nearly as modern as the Bistro as I look at a hole in the ceiling, but it is a fitting symbol of why we're here.

220
00:39:53,311 --> 00:40:00,795
So we've moved to the library at Benford High, and certainly for anybody listening, this is an open meeting.

221
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:02,216
People are welcome to join us.

222
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:09,626
Um, there'll be lots of ways for you all to, for people to get involved, but if you want to come to the monthly building committee meetings, you're more than welcome to do that too.

223
00:40:09,746 --> 00:40:13,747
So, um, why don't we start, I'm just going to start with the mayor on this side.

224
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:18,828
Um, if you could, if we could just go around and introduce yourself and like what sort of.

225
00:40:19,488 --> 00:40:21,008
Things brought you to the building committee.

226
00:40:21,028 --> 00:40:22,748
I think that would be helpful for the SNMA team.

227
00:40:23,349 --> 00:40:23,589
Sure.

228
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:27,909
Um, mayor Brienner, I met you last week and I look forward to your presentation tonight.

229
00:40:27,929 --> 00:40:31,250
Excited for the high school for our students and staff.

230
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:37,732
Luke Reisner, professionally an engineer, three children, school system.

231
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:43,075
My oldest daughter is a freshman this year.

232
00:40:44,636 --> 00:40:54,763
I guess it started at the grassroots and really pushed all the people that I knew to pursue a new high school.

233
00:40:55,363 --> 00:41:00,046
And that started by collecting information to support the SOI.

234
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:05,956
involved with that and looking forward to hearing from you today.

235
00:41:05,976 --> 00:41:10,180
My name is Tracy King.

236
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,161
I'm a parent.

237
00:41:11,541 --> 00:41:16,826
I have a child currently a year at Medford High School, one at Andrews Middle School.

238
00:41:17,786 --> 00:41:26,494
My day job is I'm a building manager for Harvard University, overseeing the Performing Arts Center, Lowe Drama Center and the new

239
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:29,961
Goel Center that's being built across the river.

240
00:41:29,981 --> 00:41:34,485
So I'm in the weeds of the building.

241
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:37,067
I'm Kimberly Talbot.

242
00:41:37,087 --> 00:41:41,250
I'm the Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instructions for Medford Public Schools.

243
00:41:42,911 --> 00:41:43,832
Hi, I'm Joan Bowen.

244
00:41:43,872 --> 00:41:56,722
I'm Director of Student Services for Medford Public Schools, and I also had two boys who went to Medford High School, and I'm a resident of Medford, and I'm excited to see the new building and what it can bring to this community.

245
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,007
Hi, I'm Emily Lazaro.

246
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:08,230
I am on city council in Medford, and I am the city council representative on the committee, and I have two kids in the school district.

247
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:13,431
They're both in elementary school right now, but very excited to see this new phase.

248
00:42:13,571 --> 00:42:20,013
I also used to work in Medford Public Schools as the executive assistant to the former superintendent.

249
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:23,698
I am Libby Brown.

250
00:42:24,439 --> 00:42:27,560
I am an architect and also a parent of two kids in a public school system.

251
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,322
They're also both in elementary school, so I expect they'll be going to this new high school.

252
00:42:31,362 --> 00:42:32,143
I'm very excited.

253
00:42:32,163 --> 00:42:38,686
This is a very, very much a connection between two worlds, so I'm very psyched to be here, both as a parent and as a designer.

254
00:42:40,147 --> 00:42:41,067
I'm Brian Hilliard.

255
00:42:41,467 --> 00:42:42,788
Some of you may know me.

256
00:42:43,448 --> 00:42:52,433
Obviously, I have a vested interest in what happens here, primarily because our son is a junior in the engineering and robotics system here.

257
00:42:53,102 --> 00:42:58,283
And super excited because we're ready for an upgrade, but we know we're in good hands.

258
00:42:58,323 --> 00:42:59,743
So I'll get back with you.

259
00:43:01,104 --> 00:43:01,704
I'm Jenny Graham.

260
00:43:01,744 --> 00:43:05,605
I'm the vice chair of the school committee and the chair of building committee.

261
00:43:06,365 --> 00:43:09,065
I have two students in this building this year.

262
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:17,127
One is with Ryan's son in the vocational program with robotics.

263
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:20,768
And my freshman doesn't know where he's going to land yet, but I have my suspicions.

264
00:43:23,577 --> 00:43:24,577
My name is Paul Rousseau.

265
00:43:24,777 --> 00:43:26,658
I'm a secretary of the school committee.

266
00:43:27,178 --> 00:43:35,181
And I have one child who graduated earlier this year and one that's graduating this coming year.

267
00:43:35,341 --> 00:43:38,022
So they made sure to let me know.

268
00:43:38,122 --> 00:43:41,363
I'm just pleased they are here to see this.

269
00:43:41,483 --> 00:43:42,663
So you can come to the opening.

270
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:43,764
I'm Aaron Olopade.

271
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:45,464
I'm a member of the school committee.

272
00:43:54,973 --> 00:43:58,716
in the school system yet, but I did graduate from Medford High in 2018.

273
00:43:58,756 --> 00:44:03,340
So I saw the ways in which the building and the faculty support students here.

274
00:44:03,881 --> 00:44:06,183
But I think at this point, we are now growing out of this building.

275
00:44:06,203 --> 00:44:07,544
We're ready for a bit of a change.

276
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:10,226
So I'm really excited to be here and to see what you all have for us.

277
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:12,248
So I'm just gonna be part of the process.

278
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,110
I'm Maria Dorsey.

279
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:17,452
I am the librarian here at Medford High.

280
00:44:18,173 --> 00:44:21,576
I've been with the Medford Public Schools Libraries for 30 years.

281
00:44:21,676 --> 00:44:23,197
I've worked in all of the schools.

282
00:44:23,847 --> 00:44:25,367
And I've seen all of the transitions.

283
00:44:25,447 --> 00:44:26,868
I've worked in the old schools.

284
00:44:27,388 --> 00:44:35,350
I was happy to be the first librarian to open the Brooks School where I have a granddaughter in second grade now.

285
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:40,191
And then after working in that beautiful building was sent here.

286
00:44:40,451 --> 00:44:43,592
And with the advances in technology, it's just so inadequate.

287
00:44:52,553 --> 00:44:54,675
and the changes in education too.

288
00:44:54,735 --> 00:45:03,261
So I'm really excited about being able to put energy into the libraries mostly, but all of it, very exciting.

289
00:45:04,142 --> 00:45:09,806
I'm Lori Hodgdon, I'm the school director of Curtis Tops, our therapeutic day school.

290
00:45:10,086 --> 00:45:17,212
That's part of the non-curricular schools that the school committee has said needs to be integrated into the new high school.

291
00:45:17,232 --> 00:45:21,255
So I'm looking forward to being part of the visioning

292
00:45:21,823 --> 00:45:30,306
that celebrates our students who are off campus being able to have access to all of the things that the new high school will bring.

293
00:45:30,326 --> 00:45:31,866
It's very exciting.

294
00:45:32,926 --> 00:45:33,707
I'm Marta Cabral.

295
00:45:33,727 --> 00:45:35,147
I'm the high school principal here.

296
00:45:35,927 --> 00:45:46,611
I spend countless hours here in the majority of my day trying to figure out how to make this place continue to be pretty and to fix things throughout the day.

297
00:45:48,715 --> 00:45:49,196
in the building.

298
00:45:49,356 --> 00:45:53,339
So I'm really excited as to what this could bring for our students and faculty.

299
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:57,922
And I'm happy to be part of that process.

300
00:45:57,962 --> 00:46:00,183
Susanne Galussi, Interim Superintendent.

301
00:46:01,244 --> 00:46:03,185
This is my 29th year in the district.

302
00:46:03,786 --> 00:46:15,013
I also grew up here, so I'm very invested in what the community and our students deserve in what should be our flagship school for the city.

303
00:46:17,195 --> 00:46:17,435
I think

304
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,084
Everyone has really said it perfectly.

305
00:46:20,105 --> 00:46:23,448
It's about time and it's really needed.

306
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:34,240
We have educators and school leaders that have really done significant work to do as best they can with these current facilities and conditions.

307
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:38,285
And I'm just so excited to be starting this work right now.

308
00:46:38,685 --> 00:46:39,446
It's very needed.

309
00:46:41,393 --> 00:46:45,635
Ken Lord, I'm chief operations officer responsible facilities, technology and security.

310
00:46:45,675 --> 00:46:48,236
So I am keenly interested in this project.

311
00:46:48,276 --> 00:46:50,417
We'll start at the end of August.

312
00:46:52,057 --> 00:46:53,598
Marissa, did you want to introduce yourself?

313
00:46:55,415 --> 00:46:55,735
Sure.

314
00:46:55,755 --> 00:46:58,837
I am Marissa Desmond.

315
00:46:59,017 --> 00:47:00,237
I'm an architect.

316
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:03,399
I also live in Medford, and I have two kids.

317
00:47:03,979 --> 00:47:06,981
One is in first grade, and then one's still in preschool.

318
00:47:07,161 --> 00:47:11,723
So also very excited for this project and hoping that they'll get to go to the school.

319
00:47:11,743 --> 00:47:14,825
Bob, do you want to go next?

320
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,641
Hi, I'm Bob Dickinson.

321
00:47:23,721 --> 00:47:26,042
I'm the finance broker for the City of Medford.

322
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:34,708
Any time you want to spend money, I'm going to be back.

323
00:47:34,788 --> 00:47:35,168
CFO.

324
00:47:35,208 --> 00:47:37,650
City CFO.

325
00:47:41,852 --> 00:47:42,973
Good evening all.

326
00:47:44,614 --> 00:47:48,777
I'm the Chief Procurement Officer for the City of Medford and I am

327
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:54,628
Beyond thrilled to be part of this exciting project for the city of Medford.

328
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:57,689
As you all say, it's well overdue.

329
00:47:58,429 --> 00:48:03,210
And I'm really looking forward to being part of the team that moves this project forward.

330
00:48:05,871 --> 00:48:06,872
And Chad.

331
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:08,752
Hi, everybody.

332
00:48:08,812 --> 00:48:11,573
Chad Fallon, Executive Director of Career and Technical Education.

333
00:48:11,673 --> 00:48:16,855
Really excited to see how this new process will enhance our career tech offerings at the high school.

334
00:48:19,076 --> 00:48:19,436
All right.

335
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:22,660
And I think that is the whole crew here.

336
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:23,580
No, we got Marissa.

337
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,782
He's not here unless he has joined.

338
00:48:26,482 --> 00:48:27,063
Oh, he has.

339
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:27,383
Okay.

340
00:48:59,094 --> 00:49:02,235
Hi, everybody.

341
00:49:02,615 --> 00:49:03,516
I'm Phil Santos.

342
00:49:03,716 --> 00:49:10,179
I am a dad of two boys at the Brooks, and I'm excited for this project.

343
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:18,122
I'm also a civil engineer, and I graduated from Eppitt High School in 06, so really interesting to see how things will change from what it was to what it'll be.

344
00:49:22,828 --> 00:49:24,949
All right, and I think that that is everybody.

345
00:49:25,069 --> 00:49:29,531
So I will turn the mic over to the SMMA team.

346
00:49:29,812 --> 00:49:30,232
Welcome.

347
00:49:31,632 --> 00:49:34,874
So you're obviously thrilled and excited to be here.

348
00:49:34,894 --> 00:49:37,816
We're going to take just a couple minutes and do some introductions as well.

349
00:49:37,836 --> 00:49:39,016
And I'll let Lorraine kick it off.

350
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:40,917
We'll just go in the order that we have on the screen.

351
00:49:40,957 --> 00:49:42,478
Good evening, everybody.

352
00:49:42,618 --> 00:49:43,719
I am Lorraine Pennington.

353
00:49:43,819 --> 00:49:46,140
I am the chairman and CEO of SMMA.

354
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,602
I have been there for 27 years and worked on K-12 school projects for 26 of those 27 years.

355
00:49:53,561 --> 00:50:00,264
So I'm thrilled that SNMA is here to support the city of Medford and I'm here to support you and our team with whatever you need.

356
00:50:02,886 --> 00:50:03,826
My name is Matt Rice.

357
00:50:04,747 --> 00:50:06,307
I am going to be the principal in charge.

358
00:50:06,748 --> 00:50:08,128
I'm an architect by training.

359
00:50:08,989 --> 00:50:10,669
I do live in an adjacent community.

360
00:50:10,689 --> 00:50:15,732
I have a son that just went into college and I have a daughter that just started high school.

361
00:50:16,272 --> 00:50:21,855
I will say that I've been coming to Medford High School for quite a few years for soccer games and

362
00:50:22,288 --> 00:50:26,552
I have built into me already the understanding of the traffic challenges that exist.

363
00:50:28,313 --> 00:50:29,094
Hi, everyone.

364
00:50:29,154 --> 00:50:32,697
I have never met a more qualified and large building committee before.

365
00:50:32,737 --> 00:50:33,398
This is amazing.

366
00:50:43,142 --> 00:50:49,165
I am also an architect by training, although I feel like I am an idealist trapped in a pragmatist body.

367
00:50:49,245 --> 00:50:52,067
So therefore I'm a project manager in this case.

368
00:50:52,927 --> 00:50:54,528
I am also a mom of three.

369
00:50:54,688 --> 00:51:00,711
I can't call them boys anymore, but young men, one of whom was a CTE beneficiary.

370
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:06,314
So I, the ability to work on a comprehensive high school, this means the world to me.

371
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,735
Hi everybody.

372
00:51:08,795 --> 00:51:09,696
My name is Michael Pardek.

373
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:18,435
I'm an architect, I'm the director of design at SNMA, and I'll be guiding our design team through the earliest stages and beyond for this project.

374
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:23,058
I'm your neighbor, I live over in Malden with my wife.

375
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:26,760
We're foster adoptive parents for the last five years.

376
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:37,207
We've got two great kids, one's in the Malden College Schools, second grader, and our first grader's at the Manville Therapeutic School down in Boston.

377
00:51:38,085 --> 00:51:45,909
excited to help shape this project with you all.

378
00:51:46,649 --> 00:51:48,990
Sorry, I was waiting for the next person.

379
00:51:49,491 --> 00:51:50,031
Hi, everyone.

380
00:51:50,271 --> 00:51:51,151
I'm Mike Carlo.

381
00:51:51,432 --> 00:51:53,633
I'm principal at MLP Integrated Design.

382
00:51:53,873 --> 00:51:56,054
It's an educational planning and consulting firm.

383
00:51:56,634 --> 00:52:04,458
Part of the work we do focuses on school building projects and supporting districts in the educational planning and programming efforts for that.

384
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,486
and social-emotional practices.

385
00:52:12,187 --> 00:52:16,751
I come to this work, this is my eighth year in educational planning work.

386
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:26,219
Prior to that, I spent the first part of my professional career for the first 20 years as a classroom teacher and drama director.

387
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:28,821
So I was excited to hear what you had to say there.

388
00:52:28,841 --> 00:52:30,262
Everyone's talking about their children.

389
00:52:30,282 --> 00:52:31,463
I don't have a child yet.

390
00:52:31,664 --> 00:52:33,545
Hopefully that's coming in the next year.

391
00:52:34,086 --> 00:52:36,568
But I do have two rescue French bulldogs that I can

392
00:52:39,645 --> 00:52:42,987
I'm so passionate about education.

393
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:49,872
That's why I stepped out of the classroom because I feel like there's a bigger impact that we can make by looking at teaching, learning and space.

394
00:52:50,392 --> 00:52:52,553
And you seem like a really excited group.

395
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:55,355
So I'm super passionate and excited about working with you.

396
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:55,976
So thank you.

397
00:52:57,176 --> 00:52:58,637
My name is Erin Crestelio.

398
00:52:58,817 --> 00:53:00,679
I am a civil engineer at SMMA.

399
00:53:01,879 --> 00:53:04,681
I've been at SMMA 18 years this fall.

400
00:53:05,302 --> 00:53:07,363
I've worked actually mostly on high schools.

401
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:15,884
And one thing about me that you may not know is that I have come to appreciate and really love the permitting process.

402
00:53:16,885 --> 00:53:22,728
Something that is really challenging and rewarding.

403
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:25,810
I'm really excited to be here.

404
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:31,273
I love working on teams at SMA to get schools done.

405
00:53:33,456 --> 00:53:33,736
Hi, all.

406
00:53:33,756 --> 00:53:34,376
I'm Kate Tooke.

407
00:53:34,496 --> 00:53:37,697
I'm a landscape architect and principal with Agency Landscape and Planning.

408
00:53:37,717 --> 00:53:39,737
We're subconsultants to SMMA.

409
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:48,379
And I really love that Erin loves permitting, because that makes the design of the site much, much easier and more fun when those logistics are covered.

410
00:53:48,919 --> 00:53:54,020
I have a background and a former career as a public educator in the Boston Public School system.

411
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,021
I was a math and science teacher for eight years.

412
00:53:56,041 --> 00:54:03,122
And I brought that love to landscape architecture, so this project is a real sweet spot for me to blend youth and education

413
00:54:03,628 --> 00:54:06,610
with landscape and creating a great new school campus.

414
00:54:07,671 --> 00:54:12,535
And I am a Cambridge resident with three kids in the Cambridge public school system, so right nearby.

415
00:54:14,136 --> 00:54:14,717
Hi, everyone.

416
00:54:14,797 --> 00:54:15,798
I'm Emily Ehlers.

417
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:18,079
I'm a mechanical engineer at SNMA.

418
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,642
I'm so excited to get to know Medford as a community.

419
00:54:21,662 --> 00:54:23,684
I live adjacent to Austin.

420
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:28,808
And I'll be one of a whole engineering team that will support this design.

421
00:54:31,132 --> 00:54:35,413
Good evening, I'm Martine Dionne, I'm the Director of Sustainable Design at SMA.

422
00:54:35,453 --> 00:54:38,194
I've been with SMA for over 25 years.

423
00:54:40,115 --> 00:54:45,677
I was involved with the early initiatives in the state for green schools, very familiar.

424
00:54:45,697 --> 00:54:48,437
And we'll talk a little bit about this later.

425
00:54:48,557 --> 00:54:56,600
And I'm also, and I think I've said that many times to my peers, I lived at Medford for 12 years before getting married.

426
00:54:57,692 --> 00:55:00,294
couldn't negotiate.

427
00:55:01,855 --> 00:55:04,777
So I miss it and I'm so happy to be here.

428
00:55:04,898 --> 00:55:06,879
I'm going to be looking forward to those meetings.

429
00:55:12,583 --> 00:55:17,046
Right, so everyone should have a placemat in front of them.

430
00:55:17,587 --> 00:55:20,409
If you don't, raise your hand and we will get one over to you.

431
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:22,470
We don't need to focus on them right now.

432
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:24,232
I just want everyone to be aware that they're there.

433
00:55:24,252 --> 00:55:26,033
And these are really an open invitation.

434
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:29,791
for people to give us a little bit more information.

435
00:55:29,811 --> 00:55:38,237
The introductions were amazing, but tell us a little bit more about sort of where your focus is going to be in terms of the project as we move forward.

436
00:55:38,997 --> 00:55:43,740
We'll collect these at the end so that we can take them in and then we might do some reporting back afterwards.

437
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:50,965
But we just want to make sure that you know that these are there and that we've heard that you'll be very engaged and interested in writing some things down.

438
00:55:51,025 --> 00:55:54,307
So we're looking forward to seeing sort of all that feedback that comes back to us.

439
00:55:55,088 --> 00:56:00,810
And we'll probably land on this at the end as well, just as a starting place in terms of some discussion.

440
00:56:02,871 --> 00:56:06,413
In terms of what we're going to run through, I think we already covered introductions.

441
00:56:06,853 --> 00:56:11,975
We're going to talk a lot about schedule and process, because we want to give you an idea of what's coming up next.

442
00:56:12,675 --> 00:56:15,697
And there's going to be a lot of activity very quickly.

443
00:56:15,797 --> 00:56:17,437
It's all going to be very well organized.

444
00:56:18,018 --> 00:56:19,078
But there is going to be a lot of it.

445
00:56:19,198 --> 00:56:20,859
And so we know that everyone is here for that.

446
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,580
But we're also not just working within this committee

447
00:56:23,941 --> 00:56:26,663
We're going to be reaching out to everyone in the school.

448
00:56:26,863 --> 00:56:32,647
We're going to be reaching out to the entire city, the community, to make sure that we get impact from a lot of different places.

449
00:56:32,707 --> 00:56:35,729
So that's what we're going to run through on schedule and process, just to outline that.

450
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:39,171
We're going to talk very quickly about sustainable design.

451
00:56:39,191 --> 00:56:48,077
And it's definitely not to minimize Martine's role here and the role of sustainable design in the development of the project in general, because it is absolutely critical to what we're doing.

452
00:56:48,711 --> 00:56:54,175
But just as an introductory topic, we don't want to give you 15, 20 minutes of sustainability this evening.

453
00:56:54,736 --> 00:56:56,157
So we'll just hit on it very quickly.

454
00:56:56,177 --> 00:57:02,522
And then we'll spend some time talking about our initial observations of the site as well as the building.

455
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:06,565
Again, not a huge deep dive this evening, but just some initial thoughts.

456
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:08,847
And really then what we want to do is listen to all of you.

457
00:57:09,548 --> 00:57:14,952
We know that this has been a long time coming, and we're sure that there are things that you would like to tell us that are top of mind.

458
00:57:15,587 --> 00:57:17,908
We want to make sure that we hear that feedback this evening.

459
00:57:17,948 --> 00:57:21,829
So we're going to try our best to sort of keep things relatively brief.

460
00:57:22,669 --> 00:57:30,452
And really all this is going to be framed within this concept of working with a comprehensive high school mindset, right?

461
00:57:30,492 --> 00:57:36,973
That it's an integrated activity that we have and we're going to try to figure out what does Medford High School look like in the future?

462
00:57:37,013 --> 00:57:39,334
What do you see it as in the future?

463
00:57:39,694 --> 00:57:42,015
Thinking about it being a comprehensive high school, we know that

464
00:57:42,633 --> 00:57:49,636
We have made this change here very recently in terms of this integration from a curriculum and a schedule standpoint.

465
00:57:49,696 --> 00:57:52,557
So what can it do from a facility standpoint as we go forward.

466
00:57:56,179 --> 00:58:01,061
So just to start things off I know we have said that we are absolutely thrilled to be here.

467
00:58:01,121 --> 00:58:03,161
We are absolutely thrilled to be here.

468
00:58:03,261 --> 00:58:04,902
It is it's not an understatement.

469
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:11,925
We're so excited about Medford High School because of the complexity that is represented in this project.

470
00:58:12,807 --> 00:58:15,850
We know that there are so many different parts and pieces that come together.

471
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:21,175
We are an integrated design firm, blend architects and engineers and educational planners all together.

472
00:58:21,636 --> 00:58:25,720
So we really think and love the ability to work on comprehensive high schools.

473
00:58:26,981 --> 00:58:30,864
But this is really not about us in terms of the process moving forward, right?

474
00:58:31,445 --> 00:58:36,089
This is about really tapping into that excitement that everyone here has

475
00:58:37,577 --> 00:58:44,220
The multiple years of pre-work that have been going on, the year of this building committee working before we got into this point.

476
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:52,024
So we're really, really wonderfully excited to jump into it with you and to really feed on all that excitement.

477
00:58:53,224 --> 00:59:00,988
The respect, responsibility, empathy, and kindness, those core values that are listed within the program of studies for Medford High School, we know that they're around the building as well.

478
00:59:01,848 --> 00:59:06,010
We really embrace those as well, and we'll embrace those through the process as we go forward

479
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:17,132
We're going to be using those as our North Star to come back to to make sure that everything that we're doing is really framed within those values because we really do think that those are the way that we want to be proceeding.

480
00:59:18,132 --> 00:59:27,294
And then lastly I just want to say that this the concept of thinking about Medford High School as a flagship for the district is something that's very important to us.

481
00:59:28,034 --> 00:59:30,355
So obviously the high school is the project.

482
00:59:30,535 --> 00:59:30,675
Right.

483
00:59:30,695 --> 00:59:32,035
But there are so many pieces

484
00:59:32,970 --> 01:00:00,161
of the project that extend beyond the bounds of the high school itself, out into the alternative school, the Curtis Tufts program, out into, there's so many different, the preschool, the Kids Corner Daycare, really the ability to bring and elevate all of those programs together, and to think about what this building will mean as sort of a signpost for the rest of the district, really a beacon moving forward for the entire community.

485
01:00:00,741 --> 01:00:02,382
It's one of the wonderful things about this project.

486
01:00:04,922 --> 01:00:06,583
And then just a little bit about us again.

487
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:15,410
We have deep local experience in terms of school design within New England in particular, Massachusetts in general.

488
01:00:16,631 --> 01:00:19,754
A lot of that experience is focused on MSBA high schools.

489
01:00:19,794 --> 01:00:21,375
You heard Aaron talk about it earlier.

490
01:00:21,395 --> 01:00:28,100
And we have actually designed three different comprehensive high schools over the course of the past 20 years.

491
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,403
So we do have the expertise in this particular project type.

492
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:39,954
And within those three comprehensive high schools, we have designed a total of 33 different CTE programs over a wide range.

493
01:00:40,834 --> 01:00:44,195
And those are all so interesting because they're all so different.

494
01:00:44,696 --> 01:00:52,639
Designing this type of building is like designing a small city because you have all different sorts of activities that have to happen and have to operate well within it.

495
01:00:54,360 --> 01:01:00,543
When we design schools, there really is no SMMA style that we're looking to bring to you.

496
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:09,673
What we like to do, what we will always do, is find, through discussion with yourselves, what does the new high school mean for Medford?

497
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:11,994
What is the design of the school going to be?

498
01:01:12,194 --> 01:01:17,216
And we will work with you to evolve what that's going to be as we have those discussions.

499
01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:28,381
We did want to give a little bit of just a window and glimpse into what can be using our Waltham High School project, which is recent, just to frame things.

500
01:01:29,146 --> 01:01:33,329
because the existing building in Waltham was not too dissimilar from what you see here.

501
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:41,814
I think this is a series of before and after images, and hopefully we didn't label it and you can tell which is the before and after image that we're even getting.

502
01:01:42,915 --> 01:01:47,098
But again, not too dissimilar from where we are here in terms of this existing building.

503
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:52,761
So what we want to do is really get people thinking beyond the low-hanging fruit.

504
01:01:53,102 --> 01:01:55,063
We know that the building is going to have

505
01:01:55,518 --> 01:01:56,598
climate control to it.

506
01:01:56,658 --> 01:01:58,079
It's going to have natural light coming in.

507
01:01:58,099 --> 01:01:59,540
It's going to have technology that works.

508
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:03,381
Those are all the pain points that are here that everyone feels on a daily basis, right?

509
01:02:03,881 --> 01:02:07,803
But we really want to aspire to something even grander than that.

510
01:02:07,863 --> 01:02:15,446
We want to think about the potential really in terms of what the impact could be for educators, for students, and for the community at large.

511
01:02:15,486 --> 01:02:19,868
So we're really looking as we move forward to think about what those transformations can be.

512
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:23,269
This is the cafeteria dining commons in Waltham High School.

513
01:02:24,463 --> 01:02:26,083
This is the change of the auditorium.

514
01:02:26,484 --> 01:02:35,025
And this is an interesting one as well, because we know that there's some interest in really growing the performing arts here at Medford High School.

515
01:02:35,045 --> 01:02:37,046
We have a very limited size auditorium.

516
01:02:37,726 --> 01:02:47,928
This was an auditorium that didn't reach beyond the basic or the base size of an MSBA auditorium, which is at 750 seats up to that thousand seats.

517
01:02:48,668 --> 01:02:51,229
So this is just a small glimpse into what that can be.

518
01:02:51,729 --> 01:02:53,549
Waltham had a much actually larger

519
01:02:54,240 --> 01:03:03,724
High School Auditorium, it was combined with a local theater company previously, but in terms of the quality of the space and the quality of the performance environment, just a tremendous improvement.

520
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:08,506
And then CTE programs as well.

521
01:03:09,807 --> 01:03:15,409
The CTE programs at Waltham High School actually were not anywhere near what you have for existing CTE programs here.

522
01:03:15,589 --> 01:03:20,791
They were all located in the basement of a single-story building, so they were adapted into that high school.

523
01:03:21,471 --> 01:03:22,732
So on the left-hand side, you see the

524
01:03:23,107 --> 01:03:27,028
the forward image of the carpentry program crammed into a tiny area.

525
01:03:27,049 --> 01:03:32,050
Had a wonderful wood floor, but other than that, it was a challenging space to work with.

526
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:50,097
The focus on daylighting, having a double-height space so they can build a double-height mock-up house within that environment, just truly transformative there, but also the placement of that space adjacent to the auditorium and the stage allows them to really

527
01:03:50,741 --> 01:03:55,785
engage in that stagecraft and try to create some interdisciplinary learning opportunities.

528
01:03:56,626 --> 01:04:01,590
Then lastly, the auto technology program as well at Waltham was an outbuilding.

529
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:04,031
It was not connected to the rest of the high school itself.

530
01:04:04,452 --> 01:04:10,176
So students going out there really were ostracized in terms of their educational experience.

531
01:04:11,577 --> 01:04:14,279
The building, the auto tech space is now integrated in.

532
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:17,462
Again, you can see the abundance of natural light from that space.

533
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:24,252
And that's something as we move forward, there's not going to be a second tier of design for spaces between CTB and academic spaces.

534
01:04:24,893 --> 01:04:37,417
We treat all the spaces similarly in terms of the value that comes from access to daylighting, access to air conditioning and heating, and connection to the rest of the school.

535
01:04:37,437 --> 01:04:42,519
And then lastly, the cosmetology space, we just like this.

536
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,521
This was actually a new program for them added in, so there's no before space.

537
01:04:47,386 --> 01:04:48,107
to be seen here.

538
01:04:48,407 --> 01:04:52,191
We know that we are adding four week programs as part of this project as well.

539
01:04:52,892 --> 01:04:54,473
So it's a slightly different process there.

540
01:04:54,574 --> 01:05:04,403
But again, end goal is to have something that really sings to everyone as a space and really creates a space that students want to be in.

541
01:05:04,624 --> 01:05:07,246
And as the pragmatist, I get to talk schedule and process.

542
01:05:09,924 --> 01:05:10,884
Take a deep breath out.

543
01:05:10,904 --> 01:05:12,665
This is your project timeline.

544
01:05:12,885 --> 01:05:15,606
And we acknowledge you've been doing this for a while now.

545
01:05:15,646 --> 01:05:17,867
You submitted your SOI two years ago.

546
01:05:18,027 --> 01:05:19,507
So you are here.

547
01:05:19,587 --> 01:05:21,868
There should be a line that pops up, Matt.

548
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:26,570
You're at the beginning of the journey, the MSBA process.

549
01:05:28,110 --> 01:05:30,891
And we know that you would like to see this project done by 2030.

550
01:05:30,951 --> 01:05:31,652
So it is, I edited

551
01:05:36,042 --> 01:05:43,745
the board from aggressive to ambitious, but this is an ambitious schedule, and we're ready to go along with you and start right away.

552
01:05:47,927 --> 01:05:52,509
And so we did also want to teach a little bit of MSBA speak.

553
01:05:52,809 --> 01:05:57,310
You will all know these acronyms really well, very, very shortly if you don't already.

554
01:05:57,851 --> 01:06:02,512
But the process, the first phase we're in right now is called feasibility.

555
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:08,423
Part of that is the PDP, or Preliminary Design Program.

556
01:06:08,683 --> 01:06:12,705
I call this the getting to know you phase, literally and figuratively.

557
01:06:12,785 --> 01:06:14,046
We will get to know all of you.

558
01:06:14,566 --> 01:06:16,447
We're going to get to know your educators.

559
01:06:17,028 --> 01:06:31,075
We are going to get to know your building really well, and your site, somewhat not invasively, too invasively, but investigations to understand the building systems, to survey for hazardous materials.

560
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:36,961
Um, so we are going to be touching on all of those things in this early PDP phase.

561
01:06:37,801 --> 01:06:45,542
Um, and really the critical things we're trying to get to at the end of PDP, um, the educational program, which you've already started.

562
01:06:46,323 --> 01:06:51,563
Um, but there is work that Mike will be doing to help inform and complete that.

563
01:06:52,264 --> 01:07:00,105
That roadmap for you from an educational standpoint, the space summary, which is, I think the roadmap for the building building program.

564
01:07:00,765 --> 01:07:07,468
how many classrooms, what size, how many CTA spaces, what type, all of that.

565
01:07:08,808 --> 01:07:17,152
Doing that roadmap, that space summary correctly is going to really help you get the most from the MSBA funding process.

566
01:07:18,432 --> 01:07:25,115
I already touched on the evaluation of existing conditions inside and outside the site and the building.

567
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:29,997
And during this phase, we're gonna start to put forth options.

568
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:38,797
The MSBA does require us to investigate what it will cost to bring this building up to code, not change a single space.

569
01:07:39,357 --> 01:07:46,664
It's a baseline number to understand what we would need to do to make it energy efficient and meet all current codes, make it accessible.

570
01:07:47,144 --> 01:07:48,405
What is that dollar value?

571
01:07:49,066 --> 01:07:56,152
We have to explore at least one addition renovation option, and we have to explore at least one all new option.

572
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:56,952
So those three

573
01:07:58,249 --> 01:08:07,072
we have to, regardless of how many options we show you, there will likely be many variants, especially not on the first one, but the ad reno and the all new.

574
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:12,033
And yes, there are going to be a lot of meetings and I will get to that in a second.

575
01:08:13,094 --> 01:08:18,836
So the second part of feasibility is the FERG schematic report or PSR.

576
01:08:19,156 --> 01:08:21,697
And it pretty much is very self-descriptive.

577
01:08:22,077 --> 01:08:24,958
At the end of PSR, you've selected your option.

578
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:30,820
evaluated it, you've established criteria for making this decision.

579
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,760
Yes, probably cost will be one of them.

580
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:35,921
Does it meet all of the educational programmatic needs?

581
01:08:35,981 --> 01:08:37,541
Does it fit well on the site?

582
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:40,122
We will help develop criteria with you.

583
01:08:40,142 --> 01:08:45,443
And I think actually left field has done that to some degree with the sites that you looked at previously.

584
01:08:46,743 --> 01:08:50,644
So essentially at the end of PSR, you've got your preferred option.

585
01:08:52,284 --> 01:08:54,345
We've wrapped up the existing conditions.

586
01:08:54,425 --> 01:08:56,045
We know what we're working with.

587
01:08:56,978 --> 01:09:02,681
And that preferred solution needs to go to the MSBA for a vote.

588
01:09:03,202 --> 01:09:07,684
It's their acknowledgement saying, yes, we think you're on the right track as your funding partner.

589
01:09:07,925 --> 01:09:10,426
So again, we'd have to check in with them.

590
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:13,448
They are participating financially in all of this.

591
01:09:14,168 --> 01:09:25,735
And then just briefly, we're not gonna dwell on schematic design, but after that approval from MSBA, after the board meeting, schematic design will then ensue.

592
01:09:26,582 --> 01:09:33,404
And that's also really critical because at the end of schematic design, the budget is set, which sometimes feels really early.

593
01:09:33,704 --> 01:09:46,369
We have to make sure we really account for the size, the scale, the site requirements, so that the budget is correct, so that when you go out for your votes with city council and with community, you've got the right number.

594
01:09:46,389 --> 01:09:52,911
All right, so let's dig into feasibility a little bit more.

595
01:09:54,143 --> 01:09:57,571
From the schedule, I think that left field had shown you most recently.

596
01:09:57,591 --> 01:10:04,345
They had shown PDP going into MSBA at the end of January.

597
01:10:05,617 --> 01:10:09,799
We're suggesting maybe pushing that into February for many reasons.

598
01:10:10,099 --> 01:10:17,061
One is all the things I just described that need to do both investigatively, meeting-wise, holidays.

599
01:10:17,181 --> 01:10:20,723
The reality is we've got some big holidays towards the end of this year.

600
01:10:21,523 --> 01:10:27,725
And just to give a tiny bit of breathing room, overall, this will not affect the project timeline.

601
01:10:28,285 --> 01:10:33,107
So we are still on track to submit the preferred schematic report or PSR.

602
01:10:33,731 --> 01:10:40,276
In June, that is a required date in order to make the August board meeting with the MSBA.

603
01:10:40,977 --> 01:10:50,725
That FAS will get into, I think, another time, but that is another milestone where the MSBA weighs in and says, they're gonna ask you a bunch of questions about your preferred schematic.

604
01:10:52,146 --> 01:10:55,449
FAS is Facilities Assessment Subcommittee.

605
01:10:55,529 --> 01:10:57,050
We'll spell these out, yeah.

606
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:00,613
Yeah, and if I could just add to that schedule shift,

607
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:12,603
like we'll work with SMMA pretty closely to talk about, to make sure that that shift one month does not affect that submittal date of June, 2026.

608
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:26,566
And I think it actually, it gives us a little more room for the get to know you phase as Helen mentioned, and will help inform a lot of the discussions that will be happening during that PSR, preferred schematic report phase.

609
01:11:27,826 --> 01:11:30,467
So we thought it was a really good move as well.

610
01:11:34,053 --> 01:11:48,040
And then just to zero in a little bit more on the PDP into PSR, but really the PDP, because those meetings, all those meetings that I talked about, really they need to happen right now in this phase.

611
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:51,581
And so there are two flavors, we'll call them.

612
01:11:52,062 --> 01:11:56,324
There's the educational visioning piece that Mike will talk to more.

613
01:11:57,204 --> 01:12:02,827
And we keep saying educational, our space, our educational planner, I did it again,

614
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:08,382
Rosemary, who couldn't be here this evening, she said, just call it space programming, space planning.

615
01:12:09,122 --> 01:12:14,544
So those two things really need to get mapped out in PDP right now.

616
01:12:15,604 --> 01:12:27,948
So the visioning piece, and we're gonna actually kick it off this Friday with a meeting with the educational leadership and define who that is as well, to really map out

617
01:12:29,308 --> 01:12:42,979
engagement opportunities, and that will include the educational leadership, the educators, those teachers, some students, and the community will be invited into those sessions.

618
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:49,484
The space programming piece is really one-on-one meetings with each department rep.

619
01:12:49,604 --> 01:12:52,987
So we'll be meeting with the English department.

620
01:12:53,047 --> 01:12:55,729
We'll be meeting with, you know,

621
01:12:56,837 --> 01:13:00,719
So special Ed will be meeting each CTE, exactly.

622
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:11,987
So those are really focused, concentrated meetings over several days, wherein we can really confirm the space needs, adjacencies, et cetera, for each program.

623
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:17,671
So the visioning informs your Ed plan, which you've already started.

624
01:13:18,332 --> 01:13:25,057
And the programming phase informs that space summary, that document that I've talked about,

625
01:13:25,843 --> 01:13:28,024
the size and number of rooms.

626
01:13:29,625 --> 01:13:42,310
I think for the rest of the committee, when we say we've already started the ed planning, that's because with left fields, the superintendent and her team have been working through a lot of the information that needs to be gathered and collected.

627
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:46,552
So it's not necessarily like a community-facing activity.

628
01:13:46,652 --> 01:13:47,452
It's really about

629
01:13:48,377 --> 01:13:49,938
what happens in the building day to day.

630
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:52,719
So that work is well in hand and just about complete.

631
01:13:52,799 --> 01:13:56,521
So we're on our way from that perspective.

632
01:14:00,263 --> 01:14:03,945
So what does educational planning and visioning actually look like?

633
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:14,911
From my perspective, being formally an educator, I really believe that there are so many integral and then interrelated components of education.

634
01:14:15,536 --> 01:14:31,181
and all of the intersection points, the different components, we need to look at all of them separately and then together, because those will inform the greatest, most comprehensive holistic educational vision, and then educational program that the district will create.

635
01:14:31,901 --> 01:14:38,263
So when we go through the visioning process, you'll see that we hit on all of these different components of education.

636
01:14:38,283 --> 01:14:44,185
We'll really start with who is an adolescent, a high schooler, who are they as a human being, as a student,

637
01:14:44,608 --> 01:15:04,039
as a community member, as people that are trying to figure out who they want to be as they move on outside of school, how that impacts teaching and learning that we put in place, how the learner, teaching and learning impact the learning environment, and then how the learning environment can push back and influence the teaching and the learning of the student.

638
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:10,342
So we'll look at each component and them together throughout the process, and you'll see how that rolls out in the next slide.

639
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,741
So what that looks like.

640
01:15:13,821 --> 01:15:25,731
So the approach, and this is in draft form, because on Friday when we have our kickoff meeting, the approach that we have for this district will be different than every single district.

641
01:15:25,891 --> 01:15:29,714
As I say, every student in my class needed something different.

642
01:15:29,834 --> 01:15:32,697
Every district also needs something very different.

643
01:15:32,757 --> 01:15:39,022
So we work within this framework, but really we'll define what that is on Friday when we meet with leadership

644
01:15:39,575 --> 01:15:45,060
to really go through the vision plan so they can come up with a detailed plan.

645
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,903
So phase one is what I call immersion and inspiration.

646
01:15:49,043 --> 01:15:53,247
It is really that getting to know you phase like Helen was talking about.

647
01:15:53,267 --> 01:16:00,393
It's really all about context, meaning that we use that as an opportunity to learn about you as a district.

648
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,696
We go and explore the day-to-day happenings.

649
01:16:03,936 --> 01:16:05,237
We shadow students.

650
01:16:05,377 --> 01:16:07,639
We document what students and teachers are doing.

651
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:13,820
We spend days in the schools, but then we also take you on tours of other buildings.

652
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:15,440
We have listening sessions.

653
01:16:16,021 --> 01:16:25,045
So we can kind of lay a foundation for educators and leadership to come from a place of understanding when we ask questions about the future.

654
01:16:25,625 --> 01:16:30,547
Because so many educators make do with the little that they have, they make miracles happen.

655
01:16:31,128 --> 01:16:36,350
So when you ask teachers, even myself that does this work, when I was involved in the building projects,

656
01:16:36,807 --> 01:16:41,428
I didn't know what I didn't know and how to come from a place of what could be.

657
01:16:42,008 --> 01:16:52,191
So we really spend time before we even get to the actual visioning sessions, building our capacity to understand you and your capacity to understand what could be.

658
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:54,471
Then we move into phase two.

659
01:16:54,591 --> 01:16:57,792
Phase two is really where we will have these visioning sessions.

660
01:16:58,392 --> 01:17:06,174
There'll be large active and interactive sessions with a number of stakeholders from educators, community members, parents, students,

661
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:09,941
minute in the next slide.

662
01:17:10,401 --> 01:17:20,446
But really it is that those sessions will unpack all of the items that you see here going from academic and social emotional development of kids.

663
01:17:21,006 --> 01:17:23,548
What student life and school culture is.

664
01:17:24,088 --> 01:17:29,130
We'll go back and say what are the pinch points in the daily student's experience.

665
01:17:29,671 --> 01:17:37,755
Not only just thinking like aspirationally about education but operationally and organizationally what it actually looks like now and what it could be.

666
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:48,358
So we even look at things like school schedules and groupings and all of the things that play a role in the overall student success experience every day.

667
01:17:49,499 --> 01:18:00,204
Ultimately in phase three, we take the outcomes from visioning and then we start to kind of think about operationally and spatially, how we can put that vision into life.

668
01:18:00,724 --> 01:18:03,506
So we start to explore things that come out of visioning.

669
01:18:03,626 --> 01:18:07,308
Like for example, in Brockton, one of the things they're talking about is

670
01:18:08,462 --> 01:18:20,869
how do we create more integration and opportunities for CTE programs and for academic programs to see each other spatially, visibly, experientially.

671
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:27,692
So we dive deeper and more granular into those program and synthesis meetings with a smaller group of folks.

672
01:18:28,233 --> 01:18:33,616
Every time we have a meeting, we get closer and closer and closer to kind of like landing the plane, essentially.

673
01:18:35,957 --> 01:18:36,117
So,

674
01:18:36,752 --> 01:18:47,076
The different perspectives that we pulled from, you'll see there's two groups that I use for this process, the Educational Leadership Team, and then the Educational Forum.

675
01:18:47,636 --> 01:18:50,397
The Educational Forum is a much larger group.

676
01:18:51,278 --> 01:18:55,980
It can range from 20 to 30 people to 50 to 60 people.

677
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:04,603
It's where we have large visioning sessions where we have many educators, it's very educator-based, but at the same time they're sitting with

678
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:14,333
parents, and community members, and business members, and students, and other staff members, and administration, to really build this holistic vision and hear each other.

679
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:21,955
At times, students not only have a seat at the table, but also get involved with me to run and go lead some of the activities in the visioning sessions.

680
01:19:22,615 --> 01:19:25,296
So we'll definitely talk about that, because I always love to do that.

681
01:19:26,036 --> 01:19:31,278
All of those outcomes are brought back to that group that's on the left, the educational leadership team.

682
01:19:31,978 --> 01:19:34,479
It's still an educator-based group,

683
01:19:34,897 --> 01:19:38,959
but it really represents all of the major programs in the school.

684
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:53,145
So we take the larger, bigger picture concepts that come out of visioning and go back to that smaller group to really start to make refinements and decisions, ultimately then inform the educational program document that's ready.

685
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:58,147
It informs the space summary template that gets done by SMMA.

686
01:19:58,748 --> 01:20:01,589
And then it ultimately informs the design

687
01:20:09,478 --> 01:20:10,639
hear those meetings again.

688
01:20:11,719 --> 01:20:16,601
So the visioning piece is represented by that top bar.

689
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:22,804
We're seeing we're having the kickoff with educational leadership on Friday.

690
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:23,564
Happy Halloween.

691
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:35,069
And we will plot those points along that line in terms of where those visioning meetings will occur that will be broader and more open.

692
01:20:36,152 --> 01:20:37,933
um, to, to the community.

693
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:46,316
And then the low, we've got the education program, space program, programming meetings that we're hoping to cluster together in November.

694
01:20:46,396 --> 01:20:50,177
And Suzanne, we will work on schedule to, to make that happen.

695
01:20:50,837 --> 01:20:53,058
Um, and that could be, you know, several days.

696
01:20:53,078 --> 01:20:56,159
So a lot.

697
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:04,202
So just really quickly, I know there's, there was a lot of information in terms of upcoming meetings.

698
01:21:04,402 --> 01:21:05,202
Um, and we just want to,

699
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:13,980
shed a little bit more light onto the process for the CTE programs, because they are technically more involved in terms of the discussion.

700
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:20,145
There's a few additional stakeholders that come into play when we're talking about the CTE programs themselves.

701
01:21:20,785 --> 01:21:26,629
Specifically bringing in the advisory committees that are present, as well as obviously the instructors.

702
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:35,175
But the advisory committees help to make that connection to the community around and make the development, the evolution of these programs specific to Medford.

703
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:53,503
And what we'd like to do is even for the new programs that are not established yet and may not have a program instructor on board, say today, moving forward, trying to get those advisory committees started and up and running so that we can get that industry feedback moving forward is a critical part of the process.

704
01:21:53,983 --> 01:22:03,286
We will also be engaging with DESE at different points within the process to make sure that their safety and accessibility staff is well aligned with the thinking as we move forward.

705
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:12,004
And then one last set of meetings, um, in terms of engagement moving forward.

706
01:22:12,024 --> 01:22:25,395
Um, and while it could also already be tired in terms of where we get to this point, the focus groups, um, that is another mechanism that we use, um, are really, really critical from sort of a larger community engagement perspective.

707
01:22:26,115 --> 01:22:31,820
Um, we have come up with this, um, approach, um, and sort of tried and true on past projects.

708
01:22:32,394 --> 01:22:45,617
In terms of thinking about really four buckets of engagement and input that is going to drive the design of the high school moving forward, it's important to note that none of these four groupings are individual silos.

709
01:22:45,657 --> 01:22:57,999
There are overlaps that happen between all of them, and there may be members that are sitting in some of these focus groups that may attend two, three, or all four of them, depending on sort of where their interest and expertise is lying.

710
01:22:59,260 --> 01:22:59,660
But this,

711
01:23:00,753 --> 01:23:08,836
Similarly, in terms of what we're just talking about in terms of participation, certainly is going to include educator representation from the school.

712
01:23:08,976 --> 01:23:21,880
It's going to include students, but it's going to have a broader reach also out to city departments, commissions, committees, not the entire committees, but selected members that would be coming as a representative just from city council here.

713
01:23:23,782 --> 01:23:35,486
as well as potentially expert community members that are not necessarily within a particular committee or department, but have something really critical and inspiring to bring to the team.

714
01:23:35,906 --> 01:23:40,287
And that can range, obviously, between any of these groups in terms of what the actual role is.

715
01:23:40,347 --> 01:23:50,450
But this is really an opportunity to reach out beyond the school, beyond the district, and make sure that we're pulling in those voices that are really interested in helping to guide and shape the future of lives.

716
01:23:55,537 --> 01:24:03,264
And just to sort of summarize this a little bit is to say we're going to start with this in the school community.

717
01:24:03,884 --> 01:24:09,969
And then we're going to broaden out from there with all of these different mechanisms that we're going to use.

718
01:24:10,029 --> 01:24:14,433
And when Matt was talking about focus groups, this means you.

719
01:24:15,894 --> 01:24:23,821
If one of those categories is one of your superpowers or something you might be interested in helping out with, definitely let us know about that.

720
01:24:27,977 --> 01:24:35,963
So in terms of sustainable design, sustainability, MSD has a green school policy and they have specific requirements.

721
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:39,767
That's all part of the process.

722
01:24:40,327 --> 01:24:44,410
They require the LEED green building certification standard.

723
01:24:44,971 --> 01:24:48,313
The school has to be compliant with the LEED silver minimum.

724
01:24:49,594 --> 01:24:52,457
We will be definitely listening

725
01:24:52,923 --> 01:25:00,905
So you're sitting down and looking at a goal of going beyond that, if that's something that feels comfortable for you.

726
01:25:00,945 --> 01:25:02,606
We've done it for many communities.

727
01:25:03,106 --> 01:25:10,008
We've achieved gold, made gold, which is the next level, always being mindful of your budget within this.

728
01:25:11,708 --> 01:25:14,209
The MSBA requires the standard stretch code.

729
01:25:14,229 --> 01:25:16,810
This is the current energy code in Massachusetts.

730
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:20,731
Medford has adopted the specialized stretch code

731
01:25:21,507 --> 01:25:26,892
And that actually qualifies you for an additional set of reimbursements.

732
01:25:27,092 --> 01:25:30,675
So MSBL offers 4% additional reimbursement.

733
01:25:31,716 --> 01:25:38,082
3% of those 4% is for meeting the specialized goal, which in this project we will do.

734
01:25:38,743 --> 01:25:46,790
And then the other 1% is for additional criteria within the LEED system for healthy materials.

735
01:25:47,555 --> 01:26:01,363
And our school design pay quite attention to health and wellness, and that includes health and material and indoor quality, which goes hand in hand with that goal.

736
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:14,510
So our goal is to really optimize the design to achieve that additional 4% reimbursement, which is considerable amount of funds that could be reimbursed to the community.

737
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,243
In terms of the specialized stretch code, we're very familiar.

738
01:26:19,844 --> 01:26:23,146
I sit on the stretch code advisory council.

739
01:26:24,327 --> 01:26:29,711
We're keeping an eye on the next, the next iteration of the code.

740
01:26:31,373 --> 01:26:36,417
It requires for schools, all electric heating and cooling.

741
01:26:36,657 --> 01:26:40,660
And so that's something that we will explore with you.

742
01:26:41,501 --> 01:26:43,943
And then we are,

743
01:26:45,151 --> 01:26:47,373
happy to explore net zero energy.

744
01:26:47,393 --> 01:26:51,896
The code does require some renewable energy readiness.

745
01:26:52,897 --> 01:27:02,885
We will discuss how and if you're interested in actually including installation of renewable energy.

746
01:27:04,106 --> 01:27:06,848
And we're very familiar with the code's pathways.

747
01:27:07,148 --> 01:27:12,873
So this code is, let's say, a step above the previous energy codes.

748
01:27:13,369 --> 01:27:24,118
And so we're looking forward to really help you understand what the options are between the performance pathway and the opportunity for the passive house pathway.

749
01:27:25,179 --> 01:27:28,102
We're working with TransSolar.

750
01:27:28,122 --> 01:27:37,250
So TransSolar will bring a level of expertise into the design discussion around sustainability.

751
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:42,401
And then we're really looking forward, Matt mentioned the focus groups.

752
01:27:42,461 --> 01:27:53,704
So we're looking forward to engage into a discussion with your community, which we know has, you know, green communities and green constituents.

753
01:27:54,484 --> 01:28:01,546
And that's the focus group is the best place to have that conversation with your community.

754
01:28:01,586 --> 01:28:04,006
We understand you have sustainable design guidelines.

755
01:28:04,026 --> 01:28:05,787
So we're really looking forward to

756
01:28:06,637 --> 01:28:15,101
you know, align your guidelines with what this project can do and the requirements of this project for leave and search as well.

757
01:28:20,564 --> 01:28:21,505
I think it's no secret.

758
01:28:21,605 --> 01:28:24,887
You all know that you have a really, really special campus.

759
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:34,872
This is a site that's working hard for you every single day, year in, year out, all times of week, all times of day.

760
01:28:35,755 --> 01:28:50,688
the weekends, all times of year, first and foremost as an academic center, a high school, with both the academic and technical programs, and also teaching life skills, social transitions, the arts, and high school sports.

761
01:28:51,268 --> 01:29:01,437
But it's also a place that attracts community members and regional interest from all over as a sports hub in the evenings and the weekends, as Matt shared.

762
01:29:02,258 --> 01:29:03,659
It's a place that's really active

763
01:29:04,301 --> 01:29:06,723
And finally, it's a gateway to the fells.

764
01:29:07,183 --> 01:29:17,390
This is one of the key trailheads to one of the region's most incredible natural areas and trail systems for urban kind of natural wild experiences.

765
01:29:18,031 --> 01:29:19,952
So this is a really incredible site.

766
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:23,795
Over the next few minutes, we're going to share a few of our high level observations with you all.

767
01:29:24,135 --> 01:29:31,460
We're going to begin to frame some questions that we'll start to look at together, but really we hope that you see this as the start of a conversation.

768
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:32,230
with us.

769
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:37,093
We've asked you on your placemats to share a little bit about your hearts and your heartburns.

770
01:29:37,834 --> 01:29:39,715
What do you really love about this site?

771
01:29:40,475 --> 01:29:42,817
And what are the things that are causing you anxiety?

772
01:29:42,837 --> 01:29:48,500
And you might see some things in the next couple of slides that trigger you to say, yay, yes, that, we love that.

773
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:50,682
And you might also see some things that

774
01:29:51,653 --> 01:29:54,355
are kind of indicative of the things that cause you heartburn.

775
01:29:54,395 --> 01:30:07,584
You've already pointed at the hole in the ceiling and we're excited to hear lots more of those kinds of things that are causing you pain and that are worrying you about this process so that we can make sure that we really unpack those together in this first get to know you phase.

776
01:30:09,125 --> 01:30:19,773
So we shared with you all, as we got into this project, I think what was so captivating to us was the way that this site sits at that intersection between the Medford community

777
01:30:20,479 --> 01:30:24,541
and all that it offers kind of downtown and its residential communities.

778
01:30:25,922 --> 01:30:35,647
And then the Fells and the natural resource that that is, the geology, the ecology, the opportunities to provide recreation.

779
01:30:35,667 --> 01:30:44,592
And this is this really incredible opportunity to leverage the Fells and the community in the education of the city's teens.

780
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:49,411
So on the next slide, we're just going to share a few high-level observations.

781
01:30:49,691 --> 01:30:51,432
OK, so ready, site access.

782
01:30:51,912 --> 01:30:57,633
It might be one that gives you anxiety and not one that you're energized to solve, maybe.

783
01:30:57,953 --> 01:31:03,995
But things that we know about site access, there's one way in and out.

784
01:31:04,015 --> 01:31:04,755
We heard it earlier.

785
01:31:05,656 --> 01:31:13,578
There's a variety of public and private and different types of abutting properties to balance when we think about site access.

786
01:31:15,022 --> 01:31:18,063
They're multimodal access to the site for arrival and dismissal.

787
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:27,407
And a variety of landscape conditions like wetlands or forest or parking lots.

788
01:31:28,087 --> 01:31:31,628
And so we want to know what your goals are relative to access.

789
01:31:32,788 --> 01:31:34,449
What's the best way to access the site?

790
01:31:34,469 --> 01:31:36,410
These are the questions on the bottom.

791
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:38,130
Are there more points needed?

792
01:31:38,791 --> 01:31:42,492
And what does that mean for a timeline for approvals?

793
01:31:43,828 --> 01:31:44,148
access.

794
01:31:44,328 --> 01:31:46,509
So we're going to get through this, but we want to hear more about this.

795
01:31:46,529 --> 01:31:49,891
So the next slide is about topography.

796
01:31:50,491 --> 01:31:55,174
So, so again, we know that there's about 80 feet of vertical grade change throughout the site.

797
01:31:55,314 --> 01:32:02,657
You know, we kind of have two major plateaus, one where you meet the building in the parking and another further up behind the school where the fields are.

798
01:32:02,697 --> 01:32:08,460
And so how do we navigate that with the building or with, with landscape?

799
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:11,742
What is, what is the best way, what are your goals to deal with

800
01:32:12,334 --> 01:32:26,023
with this great change and from a civil engineering perspective, how can we help mitigate stormwater, not only on this site, but what an incredible opportunity to provide flood mitigation across the city.

801
01:32:26,063 --> 01:32:33,047
This is not a low-laying land in the city, which is a perfect opportunity to mitigate flood in the city.

802
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:40,852
So what we want to hear more about, what your goals are relative to topography, to stormwater management, to access,

803
01:32:42,105 --> 01:32:43,986
so we can start to solve these problems.

804
01:32:47,027 --> 01:33:08,294
And finally, we said this is a hardworking site, and you know this more than anyone, how many people come to this site every day, both for the athletic purposes with these three hardworking athletic fields used by both high school and community groups, the pool, which is, again, something that needs to be accessible to both high school and community groups,

805
01:33:08,835 --> 01:33:19,583
The trailhead to the Fells, which provides parking, but it sits on DCR land, but accessing the parking lot for that particular trailhead requires navigating through the high school campus.

806
01:33:21,224 --> 01:33:28,409
And then all kinds of opportunities for outdoor learning, which currently kind of spill out from many of your CTE programs.

807
01:33:28,929 --> 01:33:37,075
So these are, you know, lab spaces and building spaces and outdoor classrooms, but there's sort of more opportunities to use the Fells as a lab,

808
01:33:37,868 --> 01:33:43,209
and to enhance the age appropriate play areas that provide play space for the preschool onsite.

809
01:33:44,189 --> 01:33:48,630
We know and we've heard that there's a desire to increase the onsite field programs.

810
01:33:48,670 --> 01:33:49,950
We wanna hear more about that.

811
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:56,932
And we know that parking and traffic are a pressure and we wanna figure out with you all the right creative ways to solve that.

812
01:33:57,772 --> 01:34:03,633
So I think we're gonna be looking to have these conversations with you all about how do we balance these many

813
01:34:04,707 --> 01:34:07,789
You know, not competing, but coexisting uses on site.

814
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:14,973
How do we leverage the best balance of all of those and make sure that there's clear intuitive use patterns for all of these different programs?

815
01:34:18,155 --> 01:34:26,780
And as we go through the very start of the project, how many of you have been walking around the site and thinking, where is this school going to be?

816
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:29,861
So we've been starting to try to understand that.

817
01:34:29,981 --> 01:34:30,762
And for us,

818
01:34:31,246 --> 01:34:35,829
It's not about deciding what the shape of it's going to be, as Mike went through and Helen went through.

819
01:34:36,189 --> 01:34:45,115
There's so much to go into that educational space plan that's going to dictate how the building is going to form in response to the vision.

820
01:34:46,116 --> 01:34:51,379
But what we've done in this slide and the next one is just to take a survey of recent MSBA schools.

821
01:34:51,999 --> 01:34:55,282
And you can see the 600-foot radius, that was Waltham High School.

822
01:34:56,022 --> 01:35:00,525
But here's about six schools, Waltham, Wakefield, Somerville,

823
01:35:01,634 --> 01:35:03,196
Delmont, Revere, and Arlington.

824
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:05,259
So you can see that 600-foot radius.

825
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:18,035
It doesn't matter what the size of that building is, the population, number of floors, whether it's urban or more suburban, it generally falls within this 600-foot radius.

826
01:35:19,323 --> 01:35:22,265
We've taken that and dropped it on your site.

827
01:35:23,687 --> 01:35:36,337
So that you can begin to understand when you're standing in the main parking lot, or up at the Field of Dreams, or along the side of a building, how much space a new building might undertake.

828
01:35:36,517 --> 01:35:45,064
So in the parking lot, you can see it is the entire parking lot, entire A building, building B, and half of building B.

829
01:35:46,217 --> 01:35:48,558
It's up at the Field of Dreams, it's both fields.

830
01:35:49,058 --> 01:35:56,420
And of course there's everything in between called these hybrid options that we're excited to explore with you.

831
01:36:00,021 --> 01:36:07,323
And of course, you know, some are flat like Kate and Aaron were saying, some are, you know, 30, 40 foot grade change.

832
01:36:08,143 --> 01:36:12,184
Some are really great fields that you all have worked really hard for.

833
01:36:17,824 --> 01:36:24,847
Just when we start to think about the building, again, part of the MSBA process, we have to evaluate code repair.

834
01:36:24,867 --> 01:36:28,249
We have to evaluate addition, renovation and new construction options.

835
01:36:29,089 --> 01:36:34,392
But there are some very, what we call very high value assets that the school has right now.

836
01:36:35,553 --> 01:36:40,335
The gymnasium is a larger gymnasium than the MSBA will allow us to build new.

837
01:36:41,175 --> 01:36:46,318
So if we want to maintain the size of that gym, we have to think about renovating it, what that can be.

838
01:36:47,315 --> 01:36:49,977
That's one piece to consider as we move forward.

839
01:36:51,038 --> 01:36:53,780
They won't let us build it new and pay.

840
01:36:54,801 --> 01:36:57,002
We can build a gymnasium the size of the whole place.

841
01:36:57,983 --> 01:37:00,365
You will not be allowed to, no.

842
01:37:00,505 --> 01:37:02,026
We need to pay for it ourselves.

843
01:37:02,907 --> 01:37:07,730
They will max out paying for a new gymnasium at 18,000 square feet.

844
01:37:07,751 --> 01:37:09,552
That's not something we can do.

845
01:37:09,572 --> 01:37:10,933
We can make it as big as we want.

846
01:37:10,973 --> 01:37:12,614
We just have to pay for it.

847
01:37:12,674 --> 01:37:13,855
No, you can make it 18,000 square feet.

848
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:18,317
they will not allow you to build something bigger.

849
01:37:18,337 --> 01:37:27,479
And the rationale from the MSBA perspective is they want to avoid the perception that they're funding sort of athletic grandiose facilities.

850
01:37:27,519 --> 01:37:34,981
They want to be supporting athletic facilities that are in support of primarily physical education and sort of the school in general.

851
01:37:35,341 --> 01:37:37,921
And so that's why they put that cap in terms of what it is.

852
01:37:38,161 --> 01:37:41,682
It's one of their statutory limitations in terms of their

853
01:37:42,493 --> 01:37:43,934
ability and what they're willing to fund.

854
01:37:43,954 --> 01:37:46,775
I don't know if- Yeah, no, they have a very particular memo.

855
01:37:47,436 --> 01:37:51,158
It covers field houses and auditoriums.

856
01:37:51,198 --> 01:37:55,140
So they max out at the 1,000 seat auditorium, you can't even go bigger.

857
01:37:55,240 --> 01:38:01,783
Even though they're only reimbursed to 750 seats, you can only max out for communities paid to 1,000.

858
01:38:01,923 --> 01:38:02,804
The same with the gym.

859
01:38:03,124 --> 01:38:06,466
They max out at 18,000, but they don't let you go bigger.

860
01:38:07,046 --> 01:38:10,788
If you have an existing gym that's bigger and you renovate it,

861
01:38:11,367 --> 01:38:15,130
they reimburse you up to 18,000 square feet of the cost of renovating it.

862
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:20,194
So Winchester, for example, has a 27,000 square foot field house we renovated when we did that project.

863
01:38:20,754 --> 01:38:23,597
They prorated the cost of the renovation of that space.

864
01:38:23,617 --> 01:38:28,140
So they paid the 18,000, Winchester picked up the nine, just to be clear.

865
01:38:28,300 --> 01:38:30,502
But they will not let you build a field house.

866
01:38:30,842 --> 01:38:35,346
If you want a field house project, you'll build it on your own time at a different project.

867
01:38:35,386 --> 01:38:37,688
It will not be part of the Medford High School project.

868
01:38:38,368 --> 01:38:39,649
They are so clear.

869
01:38:41,176 --> 01:38:44,020
Well, it's like hundreds more than we have now.

870
01:38:55,958 --> 01:38:56,679
All right.

871
01:38:56,799 --> 01:38:57,279
Yeah.

872
01:38:57,359 --> 01:39:02,364
Is this why I'm going to decide to just get the MSBA?

873
01:39:02,424 --> 01:39:10,673
I think the point is, we can build whatever we want on our own time, but it would not be an MSBA overseeing process involving this designer and this project.

874
01:39:10,713 --> 01:39:12,915
It costs a lot more to add it on later.

875
01:39:13,255 --> 01:39:13,515
Yes.

876
01:39:13,896 --> 01:39:17,900
I think that's why it's very big for the MSBA to be funding.

877
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:22,333
And we can run through those types of scenarios as we're doing cost estimates.

878
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:25,778
If you want to understand, okay, what is that going to mean later on if we go forward?

879
01:39:25,798 --> 01:39:31,665
Because just from a due diligence standpoint and a community transparency perspective, people will probably want to understand that.

880
01:39:31,765 --> 01:39:36,111
But that MSBA contribution is really considerable in terms of making the project viable.

881
01:39:36,950 --> 01:39:44,072
And again, renovating the existing gymnasium that you have, I mean, the functionality of it can be dramatically improved from what you have right now.

882
01:39:44,533 --> 01:39:49,374
We can tear down the entirety of the exterior walls and the roof and sort of build around it.

883
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:54,756
The definition of renovation is a very sort of flexible thing that we can evolve as we go through the process.

884
01:39:55,536 --> 01:40:00,018
But in terms of the size, they take a lot of pride in the fact that there has never been an MSBA funded

885
01:40:01,645 --> 01:40:05,227
build house that has not been at least a partial renovation of a project.

886
01:40:05,347 --> 01:40:08,669
So that's just one of the guardrails that we have to understand.

887
01:40:09,189 --> 01:40:09,709
Sorry.

888
01:40:10,029 --> 01:40:10,370
No, no, no.

889
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:10,950
It's fine.

890
01:40:11,030 --> 01:40:11,790
This is what we want.

891
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:13,291
And we have a couple more slides, actually.

892
01:40:13,331 --> 01:40:14,812
That might be our last slide.

893
01:40:15,152 --> 01:40:15,352
Yeah.

894
01:40:15,372 --> 01:40:15,993
So this is good.

895
01:40:16,013 --> 01:40:18,214
We want to get into the conversation on it, obviously.

896
01:40:18,874 --> 01:40:27,759
But just other high-value assets that we've heard about, certainly the CTE shops in terms of the size of them is something that we're going to evaluate as we look at them.

897
01:40:27,779 --> 01:40:29,500
We have to go through that programming process.

898
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:31,421
We're going to work with Director Fallon as well as

899
01:40:32,135 --> 01:40:39,139
the entire school community to understand what are the projected enrollments for each of the CTE programs, both the ones we have now as well as the ones we're adding.

900
01:40:39,919 --> 01:40:43,581
Because it's through those projected enrollments that we size each of those SHOP programs.

901
01:40:43,641 --> 01:40:51,145
In some cases, we might be able to get a SHOP that is as large or larger than what we have there if that's what we're projecting students to be enrolled into.

902
01:40:51,185 --> 01:40:56,148
And it's all something that is subjective and that we can decide upon as a group or

903
01:40:56,656 --> 01:40:59,818
have to present that to DESE, but there really isn't a lot of challenge to that.

904
01:40:59,858 --> 01:41:06,644
We just need to make sure that it reflects where the community is going in terms of supporting all the various CTE programs.

905
01:41:07,744 --> 01:41:11,427
But if we want to keep some of those, that's one thing that we'll think about.

906
01:41:11,607 --> 01:41:17,091
We certainly have to worry about, just as we move forward, where do those programs go during a renovation?

907
01:41:17,732 --> 01:41:24,677
If we're renovating it, like if we're doing new construction as well, can we build a new CTE space before we tear down the old one until we move them over?

908
01:41:25,208 --> 01:41:30,331
If not, what are some, and we have strategies and experiences in terms of how we tackle that, but something to consider.

909
01:41:30,351 --> 01:41:32,152
And then lastly, the pool.

910
01:41:33,213 --> 01:41:38,616
So the pool is another sort of just interesting MSBA sort of funding mechanism in terms of how it works.

911
01:41:39,517 --> 01:41:43,499
We'll be allowed to renovate the pool in place if that's decided that wants to go forward.

912
01:41:43,519 --> 01:41:48,663
We know that there's been some dollars invested recently in terms of upgrading the pool.

913
01:41:48,803 --> 01:41:53,946
And so we have to be aware of that and get some renovations that are going on maybe right now.

914
01:41:54,757 --> 01:41:55,357
to it as well.

915
01:41:56,018 --> 01:41:57,398
So just something to keep in mind there.

916
01:41:58,138 --> 01:42:07,902
If we do build a new pool building, the MSB will allow us to do that, but it has to be a completely separated building from what we have to bring separate key services to it, like a heating plant.

917
01:42:08,862 --> 01:42:16,425
And it can be, so we've just under construction now in East Lawn Manila project where there was an existing pool.

918
01:42:16,685 --> 01:42:19,806
It's a brand new pool that's being built side by side there.

919
01:42:19,826 --> 01:42:22,987
It is connected with a vestibule, but it's essentially a separate building.

920
01:42:23,007 --> 01:42:23,047
So

921
01:42:23,698 --> 01:42:29,282
We have sort of a path that we can explain on that as well, just so we can understand a little bit more about the pool going forward.

922
01:42:32,245 --> 01:42:43,033
And that is, we said the last slide as we go forward, this is really just, again, a call back to the placemats that are in front of you, but we don't also want to short circuit the conversation that's here.

923
01:42:43,073 --> 01:42:48,377
I know I already get the sense that there's some topics that have come up that people may want to talk a little bit more about.

924
01:42:48,738 --> 01:42:50,939
So we're happy to do that for the rest of the time that we have.

925
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:52,761
Great, thank you all.

926
01:42:54,990 --> 01:42:58,211
Are there questions from the committee for the SMMA team?

927
01:42:58,571 --> 01:43:04,673
And Ken, will you keep your eyes peeled on the Zoom?

928
01:43:04,833 --> 01:43:06,153
Thank you.

929
01:43:06,173 --> 01:43:06,834
Don't worry.

930
01:43:06,854 --> 01:43:08,774
So I have a question.

931
01:43:09,214 --> 01:43:09,515
Luke?

932
01:43:10,535 --> 01:43:12,236
I actually have a lot of questions.

933
01:43:12,256 --> 01:43:13,536
Thank you for the presentation.

934
01:43:14,016 --> 01:43:16,497
A lot of material to think about.

935
01:43:16,777 --> 01:43:22,039
It moved pretty quickly through, but I thought, you know, a very thoughtful exposition.

936
01:43:23,104 --> 01:43:25,046
certainly got my mind going.

937
01:43:26,727 --> 01:43:33,892
Just, you know, to be respectful of people's time, I'll focus on one area that I'd really like to learn more about.

938
01:43:33,992 --> 01:43:39,836
So like with this project, there's a lot of community interest and people have kind of been on the sidelines.

939
01:43:40,096 --> 01:43:43,519
You know, people I know, they ask me, how's the good project going?

940
01:43:43,539 --> 01:43:49,363
And I point them to the media center, YouTube channel and the limited resources that we have.

941
01:43:49,403 --> 01:43:51,445
We do have kind of a website

942
01:43:52,262 --> 01:44:01,568
was started that carries some documents, but the community is very interested in how this is going to take shape and how fast it's going to happen.

943
01:44:01,628 --> 01:44:03,750
There's interest and urgency.

944
01:44:05,151 --> 01:44:11,295
So my question is, thank you for kind of presenting that visionary timeline.

945
01:44:12,696 --> 01:44:17,959
And, you know, I thought that you have a good overview of maybe touch points.

946
01:44:17,979 --> 01:44:18,480
I heard about

947
01:44:19,309 --> 01:44:30,236
talking to students and educators and focus groups and maybe some self-selected parents, but in terms of broad community engagement, can you just tell us a little more about the plan for that?

948
01:44:31,417 --> 01:44:37,841
How do we communicate to the community broadly and how do we record their feedback in a direct form?

949
01:44:39,362 --> 01:44:45,106
Yeah, we skipped over, you know, there will be full community meetings.

950
01:44:45,506 --> 01:44:47,128
Right now we're targeting one for

951
01:44:48,037 --> 01:44:54,062
phase, meaning two during feasibility and one during schematic to get that input.

952
01:44:54,102 --> 01:45:01,147
But there are other mechanisms and tools we deploy in addition to everything we outlined in more detail.

953
01:45:01,227 --> 01:45:11,395
I mean, we certainly do show up at farmers markets or community events in a tent or not in a tent to get more informal feedback.

954
01:45:12,155 --> 01:45:16,279
And I think also we would like to make sure we understand

955
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:27,708
strategic plan that's happening now with school committee and making sure we are talking together about ways we can get input in that fashion.

956
01:45:28,228 --> 01:45:32,171
But it really has to be any and all of the above.

957
01:45:32,772 --> 01:45:46,162
You know, online communications, in-person, hybrid meetings, and making sure people know what's happening and keeping everyone informed about what decisions are being made at what moment in time.

958
01:45:47,521 --> 01:45:57,146
So some of that, we will also rely on all of you to continue to do your own outreach with your people that are asking you about what's happening.

959
01:45:58,366 --> 01:46:10,833
But it really is all of those tools and all of those methods that we are going to have to use in order to ensure that people, when it comes time to vote, understand exactly what they're voting for.

960
01:46:10,853 --> 01:46:15,695
And not only that, have had an opportunity to express what their

961
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:18,000
personal opinions are.

962
01:46:18,300 --> 01:46:23,041
It would help avoid blind spots, you know, kind of break up the deep thing.

963
01:46:23,121 --> 01:46:23,302
Yep.

964
01:46:23,762 --> 01:46:32,145
We are well-versed in community meetings and no tomatoes, but, you know, people do need to tell you how they feel about what they're seeing.

965
01:46:32,825 --> 01:46:43,829
And a lot of times people don't feel comfortable stepping up to a microphone or, you know, we use a mentimeter often in, in meetings where wider folks, you know, may not want to,

966
01:46:44,383 --> 01:46:46,383
get up to the microphone and say their piece.

967
01:46:47,664 --> 01:46:49,704
Surveys can also be used.

968
01:46:50,585 --> 01:47:05,268
But again, we're also gonna rely on, the city has a very robust set of mechanisms and looking to you for advice on what is the best way to reach some of these groups that aren't gonna necessarily show up, that we need to go to them.

969
01:47:06,468 --> 01:47:13,090
So Helen, if I can just add to that, when we have the kickoff with Mike and team on Friday,

970
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:34,657
of the goal there is to lay out this timeline so that we can broadly communicate up front what that plan is and exactly where we are seeking input during that schedule so that there's ample notice for people who want to participate in any variety of way with like a clear list of how to do that.

971
01:47:36,233 --> 01:47:46,681
And on top of that, there's a series of strategic planning conversations that'll be unfolding over the coming months about something bigger than just the high school, but for the entire district.

972
01:47:47,362 --> 01:47:53,107
And we've already talked about including this team in that conversation because there'll obviously be lots and lots of overlap.

973
01:47:53,127 --> 01:48:02,054
So the goal for these early sessions as we're planning is that we can lay out a clear pathway so that people understand how to participate

974
01:48:03,139 --> 01:48:06,262
when they want to at various stages.

975
01:48:06,402 --> 01:48:14,348
And then when we talk about like, when we get to a point of having designs, that's where we start talking about farmer's markets and community events and all of those things.

976
01:48:14,368 --> 01:48:28,198
So that's scheduled to unfold a little bit later, but in these early phases, I think the goal is to be really clear about what those choices are and how people might want to get involved and what we're asking the community to do to participate.

977
01:48:28,578 --> 01:48:30,920
So that all is coming once we have the kickoff meeting.

978
01:48:31,638 --> 01:48:32,418
You want to add something?

979
01:48:32,458 --> 01:48:33,079
Oh, I'm sorry.

980
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:43,445
Oh, we're just going to, before we move on to another topic, I strongly suggested last week, and I know it will happen, we have two really good communications departments, one in the schools, one in the cities.

981
01:48:43,525 --> 01:48:53,850
So I think a meeting, especially after the contract signed between all players in the communications realm will be important to make sure we're pushing out all these meetings.

982
01:48:53,930 --> 01:48:55,491
So nobody would say they didn't know about it.

983
01:48:56,252 --> 01:48:58,833
So your topic is dear to my heart.

984
01:48:58,953 --> 01:49:00,454
We're going to make sure we do it right.

985
01:49:02,484 --> 01:49:06,806
Let me add that Lovefield is working behind the scenes too.

986
01:49:07,266 --> 01:49:31,258
There's a website for this project that I think it's technically live right now, but we've been working with Will and the team to really get more information, to get the structure laid out, and then we'll be reviewing that before we do kind of a big rollout to make sure that everybody knows to go to the website for all the documents that we've been, you know, we'll be developing throughout this process from start to finish.

987
01:49:31,278 --> 01:49:31,938
So if anybody has

988
01:49:32,755 --> 01:49:41,721
know, questions or thinking about, you know, which meetings to attend, we'll have, that will all be on the website and easily accessible to everybody who wants to look at the Internet.

989
01:49:42,141 --> 01:49:45,664
Are there any questions?

990
01:49:49,106 --> 01:49:49,346
Paul?

991
01:49:51,587 --> 01:49:52,688
Engagement opportunities.

992
01:49:53,949 --> 01:50:00,093
You know, when we did the superintendent search seven years ago, eight years ago, wherever it was, we had like

993
01:50:00,710 --> 01:50:03,072
really quite a substantial outreach effort.

994
01:50:03,672 --> 01:50:11,497
But when you look at demographics, if we responded, I think everybody in Medford was very welcoming, very well.

995
01:50:12,738 --> 01:50:25,347
So other than opportunities, which seems to me to be a bit passive, how do you make sure that we don't just get a bunch of white folks

996
01:50:25,986 --> 01:50:32,488
with $250,000 incomes and master's degrees as the only input, because that's sort of what we've got for the supermasters.

997
01:50:32,868 --> 01:50:45,651
And, you know, we were time constrained, we didn't have any money to go do anything about it, but this doesn't feel like the situation where there's no money involved, there's literally people who are getting paid.

998
01:50:46,211 --> 01:50:54,653
And I wanna make sure we can do better by reaching some, I mean, the networks demographics are so unlike the results

999
01:50:57,355 --> 01:50:58,455
So I just want to.

1000
01:50:59,776 --> 01:51:18,519
Yes, I doctor Lucy actually asked us that almost exact same question as part of our interview and I think Kate actually had a wonderful sort of precedent example that she shared, but it's really about and also ask her a second, but it's really about trying to meet people where they are, both in terms of location, but also in terms of communication and language.

1001
01:51:18,539 --> 01:51:20,119
So I don't know if you wanna.

1002
01:51:21,399 --> 01:51:24,580
Yeah, sometimes what we've had success with is is doing

1003
01:51:25,099 --> 01:51:29,140
focus groups actually in a language of choice that is not English.

1004
01:51:29,220 --> 01:51:43,103
So the translator is there to make sure that the design team can keep up with the conversation, which is being had in a alternate language, rather than translating a presentation and then translating statements back into English.

1005
01:51:43,503 --> 01:51:48,904
So it makes for a more comfortable conversation, meets people where they are, and really promotes inclusion.

1006
01:51:49,284 --> 01:51:54,065
The other thing I'd say that we often do and can be done as part of this process is

1007
01:51:54,653 --> 01:52:10,621
match demographics of who's responded to surveys against community demographics, be really humble and self-critical around when we're not hearing from a representative demographic of the community, and then use that to figure out who we need to hear more from.

1008
01:52:10,801 --> 01:52:16,344
Do we need a youth engagement committee to help engage more people who are younger?

1009
01:52:16,544 --> 01:52:22,247
Do we need to target specific community groups or organizations to ensure that they

1010
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:25,561
drum up more voice that we're not hearing from.

1011
01:52:26,461 --> 01:52:33,883
Sometimes we do door-to-door if we have to in order to hear from folks that haven't had a chance to participate.

1012
01:52:34,183 --> 01:52:51,968
We're also talking about that with the strategic planning sessions that are going to be happening in the same time frame, particularly with the heightened concern for some of our families about coming and being present in a space right now is not comfortable for everybody.

1013
01:52:52,478 --> 01:53:08,672
So we're talking about how do we meet those folks someplace, wherever that place is, and maybe it is on Zoom, to allow them and encourage people to participate, even if that is personally uncomfortable right now.

1014
01:53:08,773 --> 01:53:11,255
So we are talking about that in a variety of avenues.

1015
01:53:11,315 --> 01:53:17,120
And I think we're just going to have to keep working at that access piece, because with

1016
01:53:17,662 --> 01:53:23,506
made improvements in terms of how people access these kinds of things, but there's still just a really long way to go.

1017
01:53:23,606 --> 01:53:36,274
So we'll sort of try to keep those two efforts a little bit aligned so that when we are, when we find some success in one place, we are using it in both places.

1018
01:53:38,576 --> 01:53:46,801
Like leveraging the community liaisons that we also have that are working in communities across the city so that we can make sure that we are

1019
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:57,108
creating spaces where people feel supported and welcome to gather their input.

1020
01:53:59,149 --> 01:54:12,462
And is the process organized to ensure that an opportunity that has little barriers, that is accessible, that listens to a broad collection from the community.

1021
01:54:13,981 --> 01:54:17,622
to collect that feedback before design options are created.

1022
01:54:17,922 --> 01:54:22,963
Is the process organized that way, or is the sort of outreach after the fact?

1023
01:54:23,964 --> 01:54:26,664
I think it's before, but also during.

1024
01:54:26,824 --> 01:54:31,786
I mean, it's really, we're looking for the feedback from our community as well as this group as well.

1025
01:54:31,926 --> 01:54:36,527
As those alternatives are put on the table, we start to understand challenges and opportunities.

1026
01:54:37,022 --> 01:54:38,203
associated with each one of them.

1027
01:54:38,223 --> 01:54:39,904
I think that's when the feedback is critical.

1028
01:54:40,464 --> 01:54:50,409
Not so much like after the fact, really we should be hearing as we go along just to make sure that we're keeping everybody up to speed and that we're being transparent in the process.

1029
01:54:51,850 --> 01:54:52,510
Thank you.

1030
01:54:55,392 --> 01:54:55,632
Ready?

1031
01:54:56,592 --> 01:54:59,094
Developing the project budget, I just wanted to hear a little bit more.

1032
01:54:59,114 --> 01:55:00,534
You guys could talk about the process.

1033
01:55:00,574 --> 01:55:03,276
I mean, I believe you have a cost estimator on your team, right?

1034
01:55:04,293 --> 01:55:08,716
And I assume we want to establish what our project delivery method is, if we have a CM on board early.

1035
01:55:08,736 --> 01:55:16,422
Can you just talk about that back and forth between your estimator and potentially a CM and how we arrive at that number in SD?

1036
01:55:16,442 --> 01:55:22,426
Because it's a little nerve-wracking to have a number in SD, and I have to forge ahead and not change that.

1037
01:55:22,806 --> 01:55:24,007
It's completely nerve-wracking.

1038
01:55:26,033 --> 01:55:29,695
It's, but it is also sort of how all the MSBA projects go forward.

1039
01:55:29,715 --> 01:55:39,361
So it is, it can be a successful process as we go through it, but it's really, it leverages a lot of historical data upfront from the cost estimator.

1040
01:55:39,441 --> 01:55:46,386
And to start off with, even before we have the CM on board, left field has another estimator.

1041
01:55:46,426 --> 01:55:53,850
So we run a process of parallel estimates that utilize the experience, sort of the cost,

1042
01:55:54,998 --> 01:55:57,299
historical data that each of those estimators have.

1043
01:55:58,099 --> 01:56:09,745
And the reality in this market for Massachusetts even is that there's really only a very small collection of estimators that have the expertise to be able to do it, but they are very good at what they do.

1044
01:56:10,525 --> 01:56:13,987
So again, there is sort of a successful model that we follow along with there.

1045
01:56:14,607 --> 01:56:18,489
I think that the biggest wildcards are always with the site in terms of the cost.

1046
01:56:18,769 --> 01:56:22,651
Erin knows, she's not responsible for it, but she knows.

1047
01:56:23,847 --> 01:56:26,689
And just it's every site is different, right, that we have to deal with.

1048
01:56:26,709 --> 01:56:33,572
Here we're going to be dealing with some rock in terms of how we're going to do that.

1049
01:56:34,052 --> 01:56:39,014
Right, so I mean a rock can be also a resource, right?

1050
01:56:39,154 --> 01:56:47,278
At the Waltham project we removed a lot of rock, but part of the economics for the site contractor there was being able to sell that gravel material

1051
01:56:47,792 --> 01:56:48,533
out to different sites.

1052
01:56:48,573 --> 01:56:56,759
We saw it show up on other projects that we had within the state, like up in Andover, they ended up bringing some of the rock that was blasted out from Walden.

1053
01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:01,342
So I think there's a lot of moving parts and pieces to it.

1054
01:57:01,643 --> 01:57:10,249
It's going to start from sort of historical cost basis, and then it's going to get more specific and more detailed as we move along towards schematic design.

1055
01:57:10,830 --> 01:57:13,732
And schematic design for MSBA project is actually

1056
01:57:14,324 --> 01:57:18,587
pretty well detailed in terms of both the drawings that have to be generated as well as specifications.

1057
01:57:19,287 --> 01:57:27,733
And by that point, we'll have the input of the ECM as well, for some of the constructability standpoint, logistics, phasing, all that will have to be wrapped in as we go.

1058
01:57:28,074 --> 01:57:36,680
Yeah, well, they'll be on, I mean, I know we said that exactly how this is going to work, but where, I'm assuming you guys are, do we not know yet when they would come on board and start getting input?

1059
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:44,045
So we typically do like to see them at, during schematic design, so one, they can inform the logistics, as Matt said, and the schedule.

1060
01:57:45,017 --> 01:57:47,399
and to run a cost estimate.

1061
01:57:48,020 --> 01:57:54,485
So that the firm that is building the school has a lot of buy-in before that budget is set with the MSPA.

1062
01:57:54,685 --> 01:57:58,728
So that is why we like to do that in that way.

1063
01:57:58,788 --> 01:58:02,931
So it's the last few months of semantic design is usually where we would bring those in.

1064
01:58:02,971 --> 01:58:08,075
And we'll have that conversation with this group on which delivery method you want to see.

1065
01:58:09,516 --> 01:58:12,259
And we'll come to a decision with this group.

1066
01:58:12,639 --> 01:58:14,000
But not the first step, but in the SD.

1067
01:58:14,557 --> 01:58:15,077
Yeah, cool.

1068
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:20,280
Other questions?

1069
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:21,161
Oh, Aaron.

1070
01:58:21,321 --> 01:58:21,721
Thank you.

1071
01:58:21,961 --> 01:58:22,922
I have a question.

1072
01:58:22,982 --> 01:58:31,347
I know that, as you mentioned earlier, you know, with the way that we approach education here in the district, from my perspective, we really try to keep students in the district, regardless of their lived experience.

1073
01:58:31,367 --> 01:58:37,791
We want them to feel like there's an opportunity here for them to learn what they need to know, you know, post-grad, whatever that may look like.

1074
01:58:38,631 --> 01:58:43,594
And so when we talk about ADA compliance and a 508 compliance under the ADA umbrella, for example,

1075
01:58:44,088 --> 01:58:58,482
For our modern disability disabled students and all the things that come with that, for example, are there people on the team or do you subcontract out when it comes to those compliance questions about like accessibility in physical spaces when our life skill labs and things like that?

1076
01:58:58,522 --> 01:58:59,483
How do we usually go about that?

1077
01:58:59,503 --> 01:59:04,428
I know that that may be much later in the process, but I just want to kind of get a little better idea about that.

1078
01:59:04,923 --> 01:59:15,492
Yeah, I mean, it's good to think about upfront, and I'll talk about sort of maybe the physical accessibility, and then maybe I'll hand it over to Mike to talk about sort of the sort of educational accessibility as we move forward.

1079
01:59:16,413 --> 01:59:28,543
So we do have an accessibility consultant on board to help guide and sort of provide oversight, but I wouldn't say it's not something that we just sort of look to a consultant, like, do this for us, make the building accessible.

1080
01:59:29,083 --> 01:59:33,767
The building is going to be thought of from a universal design perspective,

1081
01:59:34,438 --> 01:59:35,299
really from day one.

1082
01:59:35,339 --> 01:59:50,610
I mean, it's a challenge also, like with that 40 foot of grade or 80 feet from sidewalk up, even that walkway that rises up to the building, making sure that students who are coming on bike or wheelchair or pedestrian can actually get up to the building itself, that's a tricky thing to do, right?

1083
01:59:50,690 --> 01:59:56,275
And I guarantee you that the grades out there right now are not conducive to providing access to the building.

1084
01:59:56,655 --> 02:00:03,140
So we'll start there really from like the minute that you step onto the site all the way to the building, but then throughout the building itself, how do we

1085
02:00:03,743 --> 02:00:24,756
a building that probably wants to have multiple levels in it and make that feel like it's welcoming and it's not a barrier to somebody moving to the building and so that students don't need to, if they're able-bodied and they have someone that's in a wheelchair that's moving next to them, so they're not separated from their peers as they have to move through the building because that can be very othering in terms of our process.

1086
02:00:24,896 --> 02:00:24,996
So

1087
02:00:25,433 --> 02:00:29,234
Those are the types of things that we think about from a physical standpoint.

1088
02:00:29,254 --> 02:00:30,375
I don't know if you want to talk about that.

1089
02:00:30,495 --> 02:00:30,735
Sure.

1090
02:00:30,835 --> 02:00:41,258
And then, you know, programmatically and educationally, then that's why we have those program workshops where we'll do deep dives into the world of special education and related service providers.

1091
02:00:41,338 --> 02:00:45,960
And then within that umbrella, every single different program that falls into that.

1092
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:49,101
So we'll look at, you know, a life skills program.

1093
02:00:49,281 --> 02:00:52,462
Are there students within the life skills program that are also

1094
02:00:53,067 --> 02:01:06,672
medically fragile and what is their experience within the classroom spaces that they need, you know, making sure that the spaces are large enough and the bathrooms are large enough to have standards and to have cushion therapies and things like that.

1095
02:01:07,192 --> 02:01:12,755
And then how do we even bring CT opportunities for students in special education programming?

1096
02:01:13,175 --> 02:01:18,677
So it's an accessibility conversation, but an experiential conversation as well.

1097
02:01:18,717 --> 02:01:21,618
So holistically, we're really supporting the whole child

1098
02:01:22,724 --> 02:01:23,724
Thank you so much for that.

1099
02:01:24,585 --> 02:01:34,329
If I could, can we have Adele Sands on, from Rockville as well, and I'm not sure if she wanted to add any color.

1100
02:01:34,389 --> 02:01:38,771
She was a special education director at one point.

1101
02:01:38,791 --> 02:01:39,051
Yes.

1102
02:01:39,512 --> 02:01:39,952
Thank you.

1103
02:01:41,222 --> 02:01:46,145
Can't turn on my video, it looks like, but you can hear my voice from beyond.

1104
02:01:47,206 --> 02:01:51,969
I also, and I worked very closely with Mike through this whole process.

1105
02:01:52,429 --> 02:01:55,911
I was a director of student services, a director of special education.

1106
02:01:55,971 --> 02:02:00,334
So I do keep my eye on this at all times.

1107
02:02:00,895 --> 02:02:07,579
So I just wanted to let you know that I am sitting in those rooms as this is happening.

1108
02:02:14,383 --> 02:02:16,504
other questions from the committee.

1109
02:02:17,344 --> 02:02:22,526
Luke So I've got another question to kind of, uh, urgency.

1110
02:02:23,227 --> 02:02:30,750
Um, I personally feel urgency to move this project as rapidly as feasible, uh, in a responsible way.

1111
02:02:31,330 --> 02:02:35,512
Um, you know, my oldest this is a freshman, uh, little child.

1112
02:02:35,572 --> 02:02:39,194
She's a seventh grader, and then my son's a fifth grader.

1113
02:02:39,234 --> 02:02:39,494
And so

1114
02:02:40,172 --> 02:02:46,013
I'm really hoping to have some, you know, overlap.

1115
02:02:46,914 --> 02:02:53,235
There's a lot of people out there like me, a lot of people on this committee that are feeling the urgency too.

1116
02:02:53,255 --> 02:02:58,577
So, you know, I know as this process unfolds, complexities kind of take over.

1117
02:02:58,637 --> 02:03:01,257
There's a lot of statutory requirements.

1118
02:03:01,297 --> 02:03:03,038
There's a lot built into the process.

1119
02:03:03,758 --> 02:03:06,638
Early on though, I wanted to ask about QDP.

1120
02:03:07,259 --> 02:03:08,499
So that's kind of where my question is.

1121
02:03:09,366 --> 02:03:23,429
I saw some topic areas and the first thought I had was, well, there's a lot of overlap between these particular bullets under the QVP banner with documents we've already produced.

1122
02:03:24,070 --> 02:03:29,491
So my question is, have you had an opportunity to kind of fully admire the work that we've put in?

1123
02:03:30,891 --> 02:03:35,912
And what percentage of your solution does it represent?

1124
02:03:36,413 --> 02:03:38,073
You have requirements levied

1125
02:03:38,453 --> 02:03:43,697
to assemble PDP documents in a format, in a form with content that's highly regulated.

1126
02:03:44,037 --> 02:03:46,639
But I imagine it's not your first rodeo.

1127
02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:58,667
And so you can look at our profile, our questionnaires, our SOI, all the things that have been generated and kind of get a sense of, well, this is like a 50% solution already or 70%.

1128
02:03:58,707 --> 02:04:07,933
Have you had that opportunity to kind of admire what's been done and possibly, and have you exhausted any

1129
02:04:08,595 --> 02:04:13,377
have you exhausted all the possibilities for accelerating the development of those PDP documents?

1130
02:04:13,417 --> 02:04:17,139
Just a little paperwork behind this.

1131
02:04:17,199 --> 02:04:25,524
Like the first step, the draft ed plan will be coming our way to admire and become familiar with.

1132
02:04:26,124 --> 02:04:33,808
And some of the work that we're going to do as required part of the process will reflect back into that educational program.

1133
02:04:34,288 --> 02:04:36,129
That is the district's document.

1134
02:04:36,209 --> 02:04:38,130
And so it's great that you've made a great

1135
02:04:38,733 --> 02:04:40,354
first start and edit.

1136
02:04:40,634 --> 02:04:44,277
And this group narrowed down the sites.

1137
02:04:45,157 --> 02:04:51,661
That would take time if we had multiple sites where we had to deploy, you know, all these resources and spread them out.

1138
02:04:52,082 --> 02:04:53,643
So yes, thank you.

1139
02:04:53,703 --> 02:04:55,304
We absolutely appreciate all of that.

1140
02:04:55,404 --> 02:04:56,885
We work with this group this time.

1141
02:04:58,086 --> 02:05:03,469
But all of that, you know, factored in, we still have to become familiar with the building.

1142
02:05:03,509 --> 02:05:07,872
We have to know the size of every single space so that we can map it.

1143
02:05:08,257 --> 02:05:10,678
existing spaces to proposed spaces.

1144
02:05:11,618 --> 02:05:18,861
We still have to do all the work that we have to do to know you, know your building, know your site.

1145
02:05:18,921 --> 02:05:20,061
We have to do a site survey.

1146
02:05:20,462 --> 02:05:25,383
It's a 30 acre site that can take up to 12 weeks.

1147
02:05:25,443 --> 02:05:37,468
We need to do geotechnical explorations based on, you know, as we start into this work, where we're going to do some geophysical testing so that we understand the soils and where all that rock is.

1148
02:05:38,261 --> 02:05:41,303
So all of that still has to happen and still be done.

1149
02:05:42,464 --> 02:05:52,930
So yes, we absolutely appreciate all the work that you all have put into this and advanced, but we still have our piece has to be done.

1150
02:05:53,070 --> 02:05:57,212
I think the message is we're all ears on any ways along the way.

1151
02:05:57,292 --> 02:06:00,034
So if you can help us out of this slide.

1152
02:06:00,134 --> 02:06:00,314
Yeah.

1153
02:06:00,354 --> 02:06:00,875
Marisa?

1154
02:06:03,483 --> 02:06:06,264
In that phase, you just described about the geotechnical stuff.

1155
02:06:06,284 --> 02:06:08,585
Will you be doing an S-thermal then?

1156
02:06:10,085 --> 02:06:12,046
That is being discussed.

1157
02:06:12,086 --> 02:06:12,946
It's on the table.

1158
02:06:13,487 --> 02:06:15,387
I think we have an allowance set aside.

1159
02:06:15,427 --> 02:06:17,368
I'm talking with Lovefield for that.

1160
02:06:18,288 --> 02:06:23,070
We would like to hear the level of interest in geothermal as an option.

1161
02:06:23,290 --> 02:06:26,431
We haven't started yet, but yeah.

1162
02:06:26,531 --> 02:06:31,833
In the school committee resolution that created the body, that was included.

1163
02:06:33,189 --> 02:06:37,831
So there is there's an allowance identified in the question.

1164
02:06:37,891 --> 02:06:42,792
I think we're we'll have more discussion before we get to that.

1165
02:06:43,853 --> 02:06:56,657
The question is, do we do we do that during this feasibility study to really narrow in on the cost of the geothermal or, you know, kind of submitting to the MSBA and locking us into that budget?

1166
02:06:56,817 --> 02:06:59,978
Or do we push to early

1167
02:07:00,551 --> 02:07:12,437
right after a project is approved in design development and whether or not we want to, you would have to pass the budget, I think at that point, a little bit earlier in order to do that.

1168
02:07:12,457 --> 02:07:22,442
So in discussions, I think we are trying to keep that allowance on the table for feasibility study, as long as nothing else more higher priority comes up during visibility.

1169
02:07:23,582 --> 02:07:27,044
And I know in Arlington, like they,

1170
02:07:27,642 --> 02:07:41,944
initially wanted geothermal and when they looked at their site, they found soil contamination and Arlington High School is purely air source heat pump, no geothermal.

1171
02:07:42,365 --> 02:07:44,165
I don't know what the past history of this site is.

1172
02:07:44,185 --> 02:07:55,307
I don't know if it was an old farm or ever treated as a dump, but you know, things would have to be investigated and measured before committing to the soft cost of geothermal.

1173
02:07:55,887 --> 02:07:56,227
For sure.

1174
02:07:57,015 --> 02:08:13,781
Yeah, we probably will have many of the same challenges here that Arlington and the middle schools and the, I mean, we ran into that when we put the playground in at the Midland, sort of hit those same contamination roadblocks that we had to navigate around.

1175
02:08:13,841 --> 02:08:23,505
So yeah, I think figuring out like the timing of when we need to know that is really important so that we can decide what to do next.

1176
02:08:23,545 --> 02:08:25,866
Yeah, I mean, I was with Jen actually

1177
02:08:27,842 --> 02:08:28,943
which school was I at?

1178
02:08:29,023 --> 02:08:29,403
Agawam.

1179
02:08:29,763 --> 02:08:31,364
Agawam, thank you.

1180
02:08:31,684 --> 02:08:33,706
It was so far out there.

1181
02:08:33,826 --> 02:08:37,448
Agawam geothermal installation that's going in there now.

1182
02:08:37,548 --> 02:08:40,329
And I asked these questions like, you know, if it's contaminated.

1183
02:08:41,150 --> 02:08:44,212
And of course, the geothermal people were like, no, we've done that.

1184
02:08:44,232 --> 02:08:46,373
That's fine.

1185
02:08:47,214 --> 02:08:49,575
But it's the stuff you pull out that's the problem.

1186
02:08:50,075 --> 02:08:53,737
Well, actually every site is so different.

1187
02:08:53,797 --> 02:09:00,021
I mean, you can have a site like if there's a lot of rock here, the cost of drilling through it might actually be higher than the cost of drilling through soil.

1188
02:09:00,402 --> 02:09:06,666
But you can, you know, we've done a test well on a site and we got 190 feet down and we hit what's called a bloody bluff.

1189
02:09:07,086 --> 02:09:10,068
And so the rock just keeps fracturing and we can't keep the hole open.

1190
02:09:10,088 --> 02:09:12,029
So then we got to case it 250 feet.

1191
02:09:12,409 --> 02:09:16,272
That drives the cost of each well up because now you're driving casing down 250 feet.

1192
02:09:16,732 --> 02:09:17,853
Yeah, we finally got to an 800 foot well.

1193
02:09:19,077 --> 02:09:26,002
got good results, but the increased capital cost, the drilling case to 250 feet, was more than what was originally planned.

1194
02:09:26,042 --> 02:09:32,647
So that project had pursued full geothermal and they pulled back to 50-50 because of the increase in the capital cost.

1195
02:09:32,687 --> 02:09:34,268
It's also a real estate issue, right?

1196
02:09:34,288 --> 02:09:38,210
You've got to clear the land to drill the wells and have the well heads.

1197
02:09:38,991 --> 02:09:41,753
And so that takes time and money and

1198
02:09:42,183 --> 02:09:43,503
know, I live in Waltham.

1199
02:09:43,543 --> 02:09:44,964
I happen to work on the Waltham project.

1200
02:09:45,044 --> 02:09:47,964
I know this is actually how much rock we took out and how many days we've lost.

1201
02:09:47,984 --> 02:09:50,565
We've lost every one of them during COVID when I was home.

1202
02:09:51,205 --> 02:09:56,166
But drilling through rock to put in geothermal wells has an increased capital cost.

1203
02:09:56,566 --> 02:09:58,106
It's not the same as drilling through soil.

1204
02:09:58,146 --> 02:09:59,766
So every site is different.

1205
02:09:59,786 --> 02:10:02,187
You might think you have the perfect site until you do a test well.

1206
02:10:02,707 --> 02:10:09,448
But it's really, that's why we said we're going to keep it in for now because knowing in this phase, getting to your project budget,

1207
02:10:09,983 --> 02:10:11,403
You want to know what it's going to cost you.

1208
02:10:11,663 --> 02:10:14,844
You don't want to have too much money in that you don't get a support for a project.

1209
02:10:15,244 --> 02:10:19,125
You don't have too little money in that you haven't got the money you need to build what you're hoping for.

1210
02:10:19,926 --> 02:10:22,346
So that's why the PDB phase is so critical.

1211
02:10:22,986 --> 02:10:39,531
Every single one of the testing that we have to do, whether it's HAZMAT, geothermal, geophysical, geotechnical, all goes into establishing that project budget and understanding the costs at a schematic design timeframe, which is so early in the project, but understanding what they're going to be

1212
02:10:40,145 --> 02:10:41,626
when we're putting shovels in the ground.

1213
02:10:42,526 --> 02:10:43,887
So it's really important.

1214
02:10:43,967 --> 02:10:50,371
And so if through the process, you end up saying, yeah, we really want to pursue this, you have to do the test well.

1215
02:10:50,691 --> 02:10:52,072
You absolutely have to do the test well.

1216
02:10:52,092 --> 02:10:53,313
You have to do the conductivity test.

1217
02:10:53,373 --> 02:10:55,674
And you have to know what you're going to get for heat gain out of it.

1218
02:10:55,694 --> 02:10:57,875
Because you don't know how many wells you need.

1219
02:10:57,895 --> 02:10:59,016
You don't know how many heat you can get.

1220
02:10:59,196 --> 02:11:00,657
You don't even know if you can drill one well.

1221
02:11:01,638 --> 02:11:02,518
So it's super critical.

1222
02:11:04,439 --> 02:11:06,360
I think I saw a hand on Zoom.

1223
02:11:06,400 --> 02:11:07,141
She lowered.

1224
02:11:07,241 --> 02:11:08,001
It was Erica.

1225
02:11:09,325 --> 02:11:13,733
Erica, did you have a question or did we answer your question?

1226
02:11:14,354 --> 02:11:16,678
Just put your hand in the air if you still have a question.

1227
02:11:16,698 --> 02:11:17,299
Hi, can you hear me?

1228
02:11:17,319 --> 02:11:17,700
Yes, she is.

1229
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:17,920
Hi.

1230
02:11:21,817 --> 02:11:22,958
Hi, thank you.

1231
02:11:22,998 --> 02:11:31,302
So I wanted to jump on Aaron's comment, but I'm really glad to hear about the universal design, because I think compliance is kind of the minimum there.

1232
02:11:31,363 --> 02:11:32,563
That's the minimum we do.

1233
02:11:32,583 --> 02:11:44,130
But the question that I had was, what kind of summative evaluation do you do after you've left a school to understand, we know the intentions, we see

1234
02:11:44,910 --> 02:11:46,231
We see what's happened.

1235
02:11:46,831 --> 02:11:52,414
And what kind of follow up have you done with the people who are in the school afterwards to see how well things worked?

1236
02:11:52,854 --> 02:12:03,479
And I'm asking partly because everyone in the community, we play sports with people, we talk to people at work, and we hear what people think are working and not working about their new buildings.

1237
02:12:03,519 --> 02:12:12,483
And I'm wondering what lessons you take from those to come here, not just the design, but how it worked out a year later, five years later.

1238
02:12:14,463 --> 02:12:17,383
And Matt, I should mention Erica Reinfeld is a member of the school committee.

1239
02:12:17,424 --> 02:12:21,444
So she's not on the committee, but she has a keen interest.

1240
02:12:22,164 --> 02:12:22,944
Sure, yeah.

1241
02:12:23,585 --> 02:12:29,866
So this is what people refer to as post-occupancy evaluation or just another fun acronym is POE, right?

1242
02:12:29,886 --> 02:12:33,006
So sometimes we just abbreviate it to save ourselves the airspace.

1243
02:12:33,886 --> 02:12:37,287
I think there are two different types of POE that we usually engage in.

1244
02:12:37,327 --> 02:12:39,587
There's one that is on the performance side of things.

1245
02:12:39,627 --> 02:12:44,128
So that's something that like Martine could probably give us a 10 minute description of

1246
02:12:45,030 --> 02:13:00,223
All the various things that we go back to to understand whether the buildings are performing from an energy perspective moving forward from electrical standpoints, from HVAC system standpoint, plumbing, everything across the spectrum in terms of the MEP systems.

1247
02:13:00,283 --> 02:13:06,308
But I think, Erica, what you may be asking about also is sort of the educational or sort of programmatic POE.

1248
02:13:06,980 --> 02:13:08,741
to understand how things move forward.

1249
02:13:08,801 --> 02:13:10,803
And I think that happens at a lot of different levels.

1250
02:13:10,823 --> 02:13:17,988
Like in my house, because my son did start at the Somerville High School, the first year it was built and all the way through, my daughter is there now.

1251
02:13:18,388 --> 02:13:25,673
I get a lot of feedback from a POE perspective at like a dinner table every night as to like, dad, why did you design the high school this way?

1252
02:13:25,933 --> 02:13:28,035
And particular aspects of it as well.

1253
02:13:28,055 --> 02:13:29,996
So I get that feedback on a very regular basis.

1254
02:13:30,036 --> 02:13:33,919
But we also do it on a more formal process moving forward.

1255
02:13:34,995 --> 02:13:45,481
going back to talk with teachers, to talk with students, even like outside of my own sort of family realm, to understand what works and what doesn't work.

1256
02:13:45,901 --> 02:14:01,650
And I think as we have sort of moved through all these various high schools that we've designed, the 17 that we had put up there, 13, there have been evolutions of sort of the same concept that we have brought forward, which are a direct result of sort of that educational POE

1257
02:14:02,494 --> 02:14:11,017
understanding and it's really the great thing about bringing in folks like Mike as well in terms of our team because it expands it beyond just what the SMA experience is.

1258
02:14:11,037 --> 02:14:18,900
Because really there's a benefit from all schools that are designed not just within the Commonwealth but sort of across where everyone is designing.

1259
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:27,523
The MSBA has a wonderful program sort of a new module that they've added at the end of the process that we have participated in.

1260
02:14:27,583 --> 02:14:30,484
I think our Templeton Elementary School as well as Somerville High School

1261
02:14:30,945 --> 02:14:35,569
have participated in that relatively new program that has just come on within, I think, like the past two years.

1262
02:14:35,589 --> 02:14:44,156
So that's a more formalized version of it, but we do do it in terms of going to our own schools and understanding what's working there and what's not working.

1263
02:14:44,236 --> 02:14:49,020
And again, we evolve sort of design concepts as we move forward based on that feedback.

1264
02:14:51,268 --> 02:15:08,853
One of the things that's really interesting is I often go do professional development in new schools, not necessarily related to a school building project, but it turns into a conversation of a lack of utilization or, I guess, proper use of the building, the way it was talked about envisioning.

1265
02:15:09,373 --> 02:15:18,395
Because there's always this disconnect between what conversations educators have envisioning and then the operationalizing of that vision in a new building.

1266
02:15:18,870 --> 02:15:22,752
And oftentimes districts don't think about that until after a building opens.

1267
02:15:23,312 --> 02:15:31,095
And so teachers are coming with 20 years of experience in a siloed space, and they're not thinking about collaborative practice.

1268
02:15:31,616 --> 02:15:41,800
So project spaces and extended learning spaces literally get filled with furniture or microwaves or things that, because it becomes just a teacher lunch area.

1269
02:15:42,460 --> 02:15:47,643
So the sooner the district can start thinking about what the educational program looks like,

1270
02:15:48,550 --> 02:15:55,896
in an operational lens and start that process now and build teachers' capacity as we go.

1271
02:15:56,336 --> 02:16:05,524
I embed that work in the visioning session so we can lead down that path, but the district can definitely benefit from doing that work as well.

1272
02:16:07,065 --> 02:16:07,886
We'll chat about that.

1273
02:16:09,213 --> 02:16:20,655
I will also say we've done a bit of touring of buildings around the area, both like as a building committee and then over the summer, inviting teachers to join us.

1274
02:16:21,075 --> 02:16:29,597
And we were at one building, and the person giving us a tour sort of said, like, we have to stop fighting this building.

1275
02:16:30,037 --> 02:16:31,937
Like, we can't win this fight.

1276
02:16:32,037 --> 02:16:33,918
Like, we have to change.

1277
02:16:33,938 --> 02:16:33,998
And

1278
02:16:35,795 --> 02:16:46,522
it seems like in that particular like community, like that has like not caught them by surprise, but it has been a work in progress for a long time after the building was open.

1279
02:16:46,542 --> 02:16:57,930
And I think that was very eyeopening for us to hear because we can be thinking about that proactively so that we're ready to grace the new building when it like is ready for us.

1280
02:16:58,971 --> 02:17:02,233
And there's probably any number of opportunities to sort of like

1281
02:17:03,195 --> 02:17:11,417
plan professional development, start to talk about those things, sequence all of that work so that the transition is more seamless.

1282
02:17:11,437 --> 02:17:13,538
Like change is really hard for people.

1283
02:17:13,958 --> 02:17:18,279
And it's especially hard if you've been doing the same thing the same way for a really long time, right?

1284
02:17:18,319 --> 02:17:22,740
So I do a lot of change management work in my day job.

1285
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:29,142
And so thinking about those kinds of things as we approach, like today we have a new building and we can be a new space.

1286
02:17:30,092 --> 02:17:32,973
being ready for that is like critically important.

1287
02:17:33,013 --> 02:17:42,015
It's a whole body of work that like I sort of make an assumption that is not necessarily part of building a new building but is really going to be critical for us.

1288
02:17:42,636 --> 02:17:58,440
And I do think that like to that in addition to like having those opportunities for people to see what can be possible in the new projects, bringing staff along for the work that we've done so far in the

1289
02:17:59,208 --> 02:18:00,209
educational plan.

1290
02:18:00,229 --> 02:18:15,976
I think that's interesting and needed to be done with the tours because part of that work is for first to kind of start with administrators, but it was involved all teachers in the departments to say like, how are things structured now?

1291
02:18:16,076 --> 02:18:17,377
What are we doing now?

1292
02:18:17,837 --> 02:18:19,578
And then what would we like to see?

1293
02:18:20,398 --> 02:18:28,042
And that's the part that can sometimes like, I'm really excited to see what also comes out of the visioning work that can be extended to that.

1294
02:18:28,082 --> 02:18:28,442
But I think

1295
02:18:29,017 --> 02:18:35,722
We've touched upon this throughout this meeting about the critical need for communication and bringing people along in the process.

1296
02:18:36,262 --> 02:18:50,491
And I think I can see through this process that part of that, people feeling like they're informed a little bit and part of the process is really helpful, but seeing it in action.

1297
02:18:50,572 --> 02:18:58,457
And we did have people participate in the summer, but knowing that that's also going to be part of the work to have more opportunities for tours, I think will be

1298
02:18:59,777 --> 02:19:00,437
really helpful.

1299
02:19:01,317 --> 02:19:16,242
You know, I remember that interaction very vividly, because it was about how the culture of the body and culture of like, they literally have to transform.

1300
02:19:16,662 --> 02:19:23,443
But the space was designed where like, there were these like round things where kids could like sit in them and there are a window.

1301
02:19:24,104 --> 02:19:27,725
And there are these spaces outside of classrooms with chairs that they can hang out in.

1302
02:19:28,145 --> 02:19:28,925
But staff didn't

1303
02:19:29,766 --> 02:19:31,547
One, kids hanging out in the halls.

1304
02:19:31,947 --> 02:19:36,768
So, you know, it's like the staff has to culturally change.

1305
02:19:36,808 --> 02:19:39,809
The kids, I think they're more willing to just start using those spaces.

1306
02:19:39,829 --> 02:19:41,430
Yeah, they can't remember the problems.

1307
02:19:41,670 --> 02:19:45,211
I wish I could say that as an educator.

1308
02:19:45,231 --> 02:19:46,631
But we, yeah.

1309
02:19:46,751 --> 02:19:58,235
So, I mean, I think that when we're deciding what this is all gonna look like, we're gonna hopefully not just reproduce our culture, what we have now, recognizing that

1310
02:19:59,113 --> 02:20:00,914
there's a lot of opportunities for culture.

1311
02:20:01,354 --> 02:20:15,683
It's like our halls here, it's like as a school committee member, it's not a week goes by where we're not hearing some complaints about bathrooms and all these other things that, was it Arlington that did the, essentially the no doors?

1312
02:20:15,703 --> 02:20:17,064
Airport bathroom.

1313
02:20:17,104 --> 02:20:18,905
Airport bathroom, yes.

1314
02:20:19,385 --> 02:20:25,148
And that's been a challenge to like, you can't shut bathrooms down.

1315
02:20:25,749 --> 02:20:26,669
It's just not an option.

1316
02:20:29,253 --> 02:20:37,261
I liked them, but that's, you know, and then it's been co-ed bathrooms for everyone just out of school.

1317
02:20:37,421 --> 02:20:44,167
I think there were some people who talked about that being sort of a dream that they had, that had been unfulfilled to date.

1318
02:20:44,307 --> 02:20:51,274
So to move to that sort of co-ed bathroom, that was one of, I think that was one of the architects that sort of mentioned that.

1319
02:20:51,294 --> 02:20:51,834
Was it Walsingham?

1320
02:20:52,135 --> 02:20:52,715
Was it Walsingham?

1321
02:20:52,755 --> 02:20:54,196
Walsingham had the co-ed bathroom.

1322
02:20:55,248 --> 02:20:56,249
It's set up.

1323
02:20:56,829 --> 02:20:59,471
It's an all gender ready bathroom set up.

1324
02:20:59,551 --> 02:21:02,253
And it just, there's a lot of dialogue that has to happen there.

1325
02:21:02,814 --> 02:21:07,897
I will be absent from the bathroom conversation.

1326
02:21:09,519 --> 02:21:16,103
The culture is such a huge part.

1327
02:21:16,284 --> 02:21:22,328
And I think it's like the people that we're going to be involved in this, us, the teachers and whoever else, like

1328
02:21:22,945 --> 02:21:31,209
Most people don't actually like have a way to articulate what the culture is now.

1329
02:21:31,229 --> 02:21:40,914
But I also think it's all about student engagement and the work that Suzanne and the team are doing and Marta's doing here at the high school with engaging students if they don't want to be in the bathroom.

1330
02:21:41,675 --> 02:21:43,796
And so they actually want to be in classrooms learning.

1331
02:21:43,816 --> 02:21:47,658
And I think we sometimes forget, and it goes back to the educator,

1332
02:21:48,426 --> 02:21:54,250
that it's really about what are we doing in the classroom to get them excited about learning and achieving.

1333
02:21:54,331 --> 02:21:56,993
And I think it's not about the bathroom.

1334
02:21:57,213 --> 02:21:57,873
That's stupid.

1335
02:21:57,893 --> 02:22:02,517
You know, like I don't mean to be, but it just, it's not about the bathrooms.

1336
02:22:03,037 --> 02:22:03,938
It's about engagement.

1337
02:22:03,978 --> 02:22:06,400
That's just good instruction and good learning.

1338
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:13,865
The bathrooms are what becomes of a lack of engagement in the classroom.

1339
02:22:16,950 --> 02:22:18,551
In a class because kids are just sitting.

1340
02:22:18,591 --> 02:22:18,971
Yeah.

1341
02:22:19,312 --> 02:22:21,553
But it's that in bed that it's structural, right?

1342
02:22:21,593 --> 02:22:23,454
It's also a lack of voice and choice.

1343
02:22:23,514 --> 02:22:26,676
And I don't think my kids don't have the voice and choice.

1344
02:22:26,836 --> 02:22:34,060
Oh my god, we are like already visioning session.

1345
02:22:34,340 --> 02:22:37,742
I'm just saying, it really isn't about the math.

1346
02:22:38,102 --> 02:22:44,486
No, but in all seriousness, like this is the kind of conversation that I think this like collective committee wants to be having both like

1347
02:22:44,856 --> 02:22:45,776
How do we move fast?

1348
02:22:45,916 --> 02:22:47,356
How do we include everybody?

1349
02:22:47,677 --> 02:22:58,139
But also how do we think forward for the things that are like bigger than just the building around how this is going to be, but then how that we will really transform, right?

1350
02:22:58,179 --> 02:23:02,899
Like how will we really transform the student experience here?

1351
02:23:02,959 --> 02:23:05,840
I think is what is exciting to everybody in different ways.

1352
02:23:05,960 --> 02:23:10,841
I'm not excited about talking about the bathrooms personally, but somebody will be, I promise.

1353
02:23:12,483 --> 02:23:14,345
It'll be passed.

1354
02:23:17,087 --> 02:23:23,953
Sort of a running joke that the school committee talks about the bathrooms like way too much and we look forward to the day we don't have to do that anymore.

1355
02:23:25,534 --> 02:23:27,656
So I think this was very helpful.

1356
02:23:27,676 --> 02:23:30,418
Are there any last questions from anybody?

1357
02:23:35,322 --> 02:23:35,683
Okay.

1358
02:23:37,384 --> 02:23:40,166
Thank you team for joining us, all of you.

1359
02:23:41,821 --> 02:23:43,783
And is there a motion to adjourn?

1360
02:23:46,646 --> 02:23:49,508
Emily seconded by by Libby.

1361
02:23:50,690 --> 02:23:51,871
Okay, I will call the roll.

1362
02:23:51,971 --> 02:23:52,551
Jenny Ham.

1363
02:23:52,571 --> 02:23:52,952
Yes.

1364
02:23:53,032 --> 02:23:53,993
Mayor Longo Kern.

1365
02:23:54,013 --> 02:23:54,253
Yes.

1366
02:23:54,874 --> 02:23:55,715
Dr. Galluzzi.

1367
02:23:55,895 --> 02:23:56,135
