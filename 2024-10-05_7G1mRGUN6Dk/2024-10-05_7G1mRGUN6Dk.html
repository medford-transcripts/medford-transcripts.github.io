    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=665.054s">I</a>  for one feels this is a good expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=667.055s">I</a>  mean, I mean a good, a good initiative and a good endeavor because we look at the way that city's been spending money, lack of financial transparency anytime that we can set up a revolving fund or a trust fund to be sure that that money is being spent where it's supposed to be spent I think would make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=681.466s">So,</a>  by approving this we're actually providing an additional check and balance and additional control on the frivolous and wasteful spending that we're seeing that's coming out of the administration and the lack of transparency that was coming out of administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=692.153s">So</a>  by approving this, we're going to be creating another layer of oversight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=694.86s">I</a>  think that's a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=695.742s">So</a>  I'd move for approval.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=697.366s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=697.647s">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=698.652s">and</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=700.273s">Again,</a>  I think that I think Councilor Knight bringing those words up, I think that it's important when we're looking at it with the oversight that's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=709.475s">Again,</a>  it's the only reason why I am voting for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=712.796s">Anything</a>  like I said, that deals with any fiscal responsibility or requests in this body, I would not support for the fact that we still have no idea of our fiscal future here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=725.66s">in</a>  the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=726.32s">We</a>  have no, had no discussions with the mayor of the administration and guide us where we are financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=733.922s">So</a>  again, that's a dire situation, but I would support this paper.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=738.464s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=739.064s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=740.064s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=740.904s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=741.645s">I</a>  just wanted to see if Engineer Wirtala had any kind of short summary of what this is and what the Stormwater Board has been doing.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=747.946s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=752.107s">Thank</a>  you for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=754.583s">This</a>  is just a, we're setting up a stormwater regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=758.166s">There's</a>  new stormwater regulations that the city is required to do by federal law because we dump it to the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=764.632s">This</a>  is a, there is a fee going to be associated with that permit, and we need a revolving account to be associated with that fee.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=775.362s">Great,</a>  any questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=780.044s">questions</a>  from the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=780.904s">Seeing</a>  none, so on the motion, Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli for first reading.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=787.726s">Mr.</a>  Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=788.826s">Does</a>  this require first reading? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=790.147s">It's</a>  not in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=791.427s">Oh,</a>  I guess it is in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=793.088s">Sorry,</a>  my apologies.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=798.129s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=798.849s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=799.869s">Councilor</a>  Collins? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=805.871s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=806.551s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=807.931s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=809.312s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=813.426s">Yes,</a>  six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=816.327s">The</a>  motion passes for first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=817.988s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=819.729s">Yeah,</a>  sorry, okay, one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=821.189s">23-039?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=822.11s">Yes,</a>  ma'am. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=824.13s">What</a>  was that one? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=824.831s">Okay,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=843.956s">All</a>  right, I'll start with, I'll just order. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=849.543s">23-038</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request the city administration to deploy pothole crews to pass roadways with priority to emergency arteries in the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=861.045s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=861.866s">No,</a>  thank you for sticking around to hear a couple of these resolutions that are on the agenda this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=867.272s">Ultimately,</a>  the condition of our roadways in the city of deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=871.257s">I</a>  think you know what I think we all know, right, you could drive in front of Bob's food store for the past five years, and the bottle hasn't been <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=879.466s">patched</a>  even, never mind a plan to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=882.75s">You'll</a>  drive around the Winthrop Street Rotary going down High Street and you'll cross over the first pedestrian crosswalk there and ever since the first Eversource project, the <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=894.612s">Crosswalk</a>  has been sunken in for now eight, nine years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=898.835s">I</a>  know our DPW, I know our commissioner, I know our mayor drives down these roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=902.557s">So</a>  I know that they know the condition of these roadways is terrible, but we need to develop some sort of plan, some sort of methodology for how we're gonna attack this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=912.704s">We</a>  have C-Click fix and we have 50 DPW members. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=915.706s">I</a>  don't see why we can't take them all one day and say, get on the roads, drive down our emergency arteries and document each pothole that's on there and then we can put a plan together. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=923.051s">on</a>  how do we can patch these emergency arteries saving ultimately these the roads that our emergency vehicles drive down or EMS vehicles drive down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=928.392s">You</a>  know, when there's a snow emergency, these are the vehicles that we're not allowed to park on, because these streets are used for public safety purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=935.194s">So</a>  I think that it's something that we need to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=937.295s">And</a>  I'm hoping that through the leadership of your office, you'll be able to come up with a plan on how we can address that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=942.816s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=944.036s">Any</a>  other Councilors wish to speak before</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=947.254s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=948.354s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor for putting this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=950.475s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=951.055s">I</a>  think we all drive down the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=952.496s">We're</a>  all getting the same calls about the holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=955.737s">They</a>  just keep getting bigger and bigger. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=957.937s">We</a>  patched them, especially when you get this hot weather and cold weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=963.399s">patch</a>  comes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=964.38s">So</a>  I agree with Councilor Layton, some type of plan has to be come up with to at least get the emergency arteries into some kind of shape that people don't keep getting flat tires.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=979.189s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=982.231s">Chief</a>  Engineer Ortel, do you have anything you could share?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=984.672s">I</a>  have nothing to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=986.273s">I'm</a>  here for questions, if you have any.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=988.795s">Any</a>  specific questions from the Council?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=993.154s">I</a>  have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=994.535s">Golden</a>  Ave has been a topic of discussion now for going in the better part of five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1000.638s">We</a>  appropriated some money to have the underground infrastructure of Golden Ave repaired and then also have the above ground infrastructure of Golden Ave repaired. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1008.482s">And</a>  I think that was supposed to take place over the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1011.544s">Do</a>  you have any idea what's going on with that project?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1016.947s">I</a>  really wasn't prepared to speak on those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1020.389s">I</a>  will get you the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1022.05s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1024.17s">Any</a>  other questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1029.692s">We'll</a>  take you for public, we'll take you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1031.373s">All</a>  right, so Mr. Wardeller, if you want to, Mr. Casagnani, if you want to come up and speak.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1042.658s">Yeah,</a>  since this subject has come up again and again and again, I recollect when Councilor De La Ruza was here, he called the plot holes plot holders. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1055.231s">But</a>  anyways, I brought this up years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1057.713s">I</a>  kind of understand why you fix a pothole, and then it regurgitates, and it becomes a pothole again after it was patched. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1067.461s">I</a>  brought this up years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1069.162s">Maybe</a>  we should reach out to other TPW yachts, such as Buffalo, New York, or Montreal, Quebec, wherever, someplace in Maine, where they have probably more potholes than we have, since they probably use more salt. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1085.33s">If</a>  I DPW could reach out our administration, maybe there's a better way to build a mousetrap. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1092.839s">Maybe</a>  if you cut them at an angle, what a task skills are, I'm not sure, whether it's slanted in or slanted out, or different type of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1104.82s">but</a>  it seems like we're fighting mother nature and it's the same old song and dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1109.163s">I've</a>  also lost two tires on the old 2155 out streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1114.347s">I</a>  have yet to put in to get paid for one, but I think this time it's more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1121.432s">And</a>  of course, Councilor Knight lost two at one shot on Mystic Avenue, but you gotta pay attention out there too.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1129.218s">Good</a>  memory, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1131.38s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1136.784s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1137.525s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1138.185s">23-039</a>  offered by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1141.348s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council have the city engineer report back with the repaving schedule for Bower, Holton, Temple, and Tontine streets this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1148.894s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the public utilities pave curb to curb similar to the same standards private contractors are held to when they open the streets.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1156.382s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1158.103s">I</a>  guess we're doing Ellington Street now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1159.765s">I</a>  see that's open. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1161.406s">Do</a>  we have a schedule of when these streets are going to be paved? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1164.868s">I</a>  mean, I'm assuming they're going to be paved crib to crib, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1169.872s">Because</a>  we're holding private contractors and making them pave crib to crib when they open the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1174.635s">So</a>  public utilities should be up to the same standard.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1178.738s">By</a>  law, they're only allowed to repave their trench.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1185.192s">We've</a>  this council passed a resolution seven years ago, when Council March is here.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1189.575s">My</a>  understanding is that the state Supreme Court ruled that all they have to do is repave the trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1194.577s">Now</a>  I know that Engrid has done more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1200.041s">Our</a>  city standard is going usually one foot beyond the trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1203.583s">And</a>  they tend to take a lane because it's another foot, you know, and their trenches and usually straight.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1211.207s">So</a>  why is it when a private contractor puts a pipe in the street? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1214.789s">They</a>  have to pave the whole street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1216.429s">They</a>  have to pave crib to crib.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1217.35s">That's</a>  a private contractor you're talking about.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1221.33s">The</a>  rules should be the same for everybody.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1222.851s">I</a>  agree.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1223.231s">Rules</a>  should be the same for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1224.751s">I</a>  mean, these companies are coming in, they're destroying our streets, and we get sinkholes, and they come in, they're gone, and six months later, it's all sunk in, they never come back and fix it.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1235.133s">So</a>  they typically do a cold patch, or not cold patch, they do a temporary trench, and then they come back and they do a resurfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1242.635s">Typically,</a>  six months after they do the work in that six months falls within the winter moratorium, then it goes to the next spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1249.779s">We</a>  have been with tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1251.34s">Why</a>  are we digging up during with the moratorium, because it's over 40 degrees and it's warm.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1255.602s">In</a>  the past, we've never done that before. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1257.023s">We've</a>  always that you should take that up with the TDW commissioner because I don't think it's right that these these companies to on health to the same standards that the private companies are held so it's not it's just not fair.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1270.28s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1271.0s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1272.001s">I</a>  mean, I think what we're hearing is that we all agree that the public utility should be held to a higher standard, but that the state law says that they don't have to be, and we don't control that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1281.046s">So,</a>  you know.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1282.267s">It's</a>  not a city project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1283.647s">This</a>  is Engrid doing their gas main replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1286.709s">I</a>  do know that it's not gonna be in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1288.55s">It'll</a>  probably be summer or fall before they come back and do the resurfacing for those roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1293.533s">And</a>  they're very narrow roads, so we'll see how wide those repaving efforts are.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1301.994s">Any</a>  other questions, Council night.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1304.156s">One</a>  thing I want to talk about in the past I've spoken about with Tim when he was the city engineer was, you know, some sort of mitigation agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1313.526s">When</a>  these public utilities come to our community and dig up our streets and that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1318.211s">expect</a>  to leave their supplies their equipment, their stock on public ways or on public passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1326.643s">So</a>  that's one way I think that we can look at this right if they want to leave the ticket stuff and get it out of here.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1333.296s">On</a>  and grits case. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1334.497s">Yeah,</a>  this one has some stuff parked on Thomas, that wasn't the arrangement for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1340.682s">There</a>  have been mitigation agreements, especially with the Walnut Street Metcalfe roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1346.966s">I</a>  know it's been done in the past we use a spot.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1349.168s">So</a>  I think that that's something that if we look at strengthening those mitigation agreements, I think that might be able to be a way that we can expand that patch on the roadway to maybe go a little bit further than a foot.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1360.218s">Yeah,</a>  we did just receive an updated projected list for the 23 through 26 season of the integrated proposed works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1368.385s">And</a>  so we will try to pair that up with our own repaving efforts so that we get more utilities in and repaving done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1376.771s">in</a>  accordance with this so we can save a little bit of money and stretch our funds.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1380.237s">We</a>  could post it on the website?</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1382.52s">It</a>  will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1383.222s">Steve</a>  Smyrna is on my case about it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1384.844s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1385.285s">Okay,</a>  excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1385.986s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1388.938s">Thank</a>  you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1390.759s">The</a>  question I have is, as I know in the past before your entry to this wonderful position, we had a question we had with all the road work that's being managed throughout this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1404.867s">How</a>  have we set it up that since we don't have a clerk of the works, how do we manage <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1414.185s">the</a>  work of one, let's say, National Grid comes in, sets a trench, leaves, who's monitoring that at the end of the project? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1422.792s">Because</a>  that's typically been the issue, that we just don't have enough people.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1426.355s">Right,</a>  and we actually, our DPW staff is really great about reporting issues to us, the whole, and residents too, everyone kind of chips in.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1437.166s">keeps</a>  eyes on things and we tend to find out what's so but we don't have anything formal like in place where it says, you know, we have an alert systems is job, you know, job, job, a from National Grid, public street.</p>

    <p>[Owen Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1450.435s">Yeah,</a>  internally, we do track the permits and what's been going on and what is right, you know, been allowed the MSEs is a great way for us to track it internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1460.121s">so</a>  that when the springtime happens, we can say, okay, you were- We have to go check it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1464.602s">It's</a>  time to repave and resurface. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1466.503s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1466.763s">All</a>  right, perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1467.303s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1468.823s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1469.923s">Any</a>  other discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1474.544s">Seeing</a>  none, so on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by- So moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1479.286s">Councilor</a>  Knight, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1480.446s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1481.086s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1481.966s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1484.007s">Thank</a>  you, Owen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1486.107s">We</a>  are still under suspension.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1505.223s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1506.124s">I</a>  know we didn't get something from the Mayor's office today in regards to this, but I'm sure we're all getting the calls from everybody about not getting mail for two or three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1516.732s">And</a>  all I could ask is that this council send something to our federal delegation and that we urge people to <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1524.138s">I'll</a>  call on Catherine Clark, Congressman Clark, Senator Maki, Senator Warren, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1531.704s">If</a>  we could send something to my end, I know the mayor has been working on it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1535.227s">So</a>  if that could be done, it'd be appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1537.569s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Carmiel. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1538.69s">Madam</a>  President, might as well just go with the last two, if we can.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1551.703s">This</a>  is my last one, I'm going home.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1556.187s">Probably.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1558.569s">What's</a>  the subject? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1559.29s">Remind</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1560.631s">Post</a>  office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1562.373s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1564.835s">I</a>  want to say factually, my wife has a habit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1570.333s">of</a>  sending birthday cards and Easter cards and Hanukkah cards and things of that nature to friends and associates. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1580.419s">And</a>  she usually slips in a couple of scratch tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1585.122s">I</a>  think you probably know where I'm going. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1586.642s">This</a>  has been going on a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1590.084s">She</a>  asked her friends, did you get my card? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1592.846s">The</a>  answer is no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1596.548s">So</a>  I find it very disconcerting that <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1600.459s">When</a>  I was a kid, it was said that the meal must go through a range, so no sleep, shine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1608.544s">And</a>  I hate to think that something nefarious is going on in the postal office, but that's lousy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1621.927s">And</a>  I'm sure there's some other stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1623.728s">As</a>  you know, in Melrose, the lady, I think we call her a lady, post office gal, was robbed at knife point by two hoodlums. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1637.274s">And</a>  I guess what they wanted was, I didn't think she was carrying a 24-carat gold bullion, and she wasn't, but they wanted the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1647.797s">the</a>  key to the city post office boxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1650.779s">Now</a>  I'm not sure when that happens, if the post office general immediately changes the locks and issues new keys at that instant. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1663.575s">Because</a>  in the old days, people would fish them out with chewing gum in a fishing rod, but they made them mailboxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1669.88s">So</a>  I kind of put a decent package in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1672.482s">I</a>  have to go to the post office physically to bring it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1677.026s">So</a>  now when she tells me to mail these cards with scratch stickers in them, I go in the post office and put it into the slit where the sack is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1687.094s">But</a>  I'm not sure if that even works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1691.152s">It's</a>  kind of sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1693.174s">The</a>  state of the country, the state of some peoples, it's just not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1697.318s">I</a>  hope they can do something about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1700.14s">Maybe</a>  put a tracker or some sort of technology chip or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1704.164s">Find</a>  out what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1706.446s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1708.648s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Castagnetti. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1710.33s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1716.893s">All</a>  those opposed motion passes, going up to 23-040 offered by Councilor Caraviello be resolved the Metro City Council request that the Recreation Department look into putting a port-a-potty at the pickleball courts at Duggar Park, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1729.483s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1731.605s">I</a>  don't know if anybody has been driving around the city in the morning lately. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1738.257s">We</a>  run between nine and 11, probably 50, 60 cars of people playing pickleball, which is just growing in leaps and bounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1747.139s">They've</a>  reached out to me, all the people that are playing there, senior citizens, and they're asking if they could be a part of a portal party there for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1757.781s">So</a>  if we could ask that the recreation department look into putting a portal party somewhere over there for them, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1767.181s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1768.665s">I</a>  completely understand what you're asking for as a member of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1774.733s">In</a>  our business, in the recreation business, when we're asking for what applies, it sounds great, but because of the pending snow and- And the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1783.015s">And</a>  the issues.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1783.895s">They're</a>  not looking right this second.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1786.056s">That</a>  was a confusion, so I think that, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1787.977s">No,</a>  I think that anywhere there are parks, I think that I would second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1792.618s">You</a>  know, once we have, you know, during the spring season where we have the traffic that we have now at <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1801.4s">Doug</a>  a park. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1802.022s">I</a>  think it's important that we do.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1804.225s">Uh,</a>  you know, like you said, as you know, a lot of them seniors are there and they have a different needs than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1811.317s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1812.018s">So</a>  I second the motion in further discussion.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1957.945s">Thank</a>  you Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1960.607s">As</a>  folks know, <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1962.147s">We've</a>  had a fiscal 23 budget last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1964.89s">The</a>  process was less than ideal to be kind to the process, and there have been ongoing issues with us getting the information that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1973.158s">Since</a>  then, it's also come to my attention from members of various boards and commissions in the city that they don't feel that they have the information that they need around their budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1982.9s">and</a>  that they have some concerns around what has happened to funding that they had and grant funding that has come in and things of that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=1991.304s">I</a>  won't get more specific on that right now, but suffice it to say that boards and commissions <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2000.453s">have</a>  serious concerns about the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2001.954s">So</a>  these recommendations are to request that the city administration adjust their procedures and processes around the budget and finance and financial information to better inform boards and commissions of the status of their finances and in general to better inform the council and residents about the city budget, where we stand <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2022.644s">mid-year</a>  and getting that process going earlier and making sure everyone has the information they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2028.389s">So</a>  I would ask my colleagues to move approval.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2032.252s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2033.233s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2035.455s">Councilor</a>  Scarpellilli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2036.175s">I</a>  thank Vice President Bears for bringing this forward, but this is common practice in most municipal budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2045.383s">We're</a>  further along in our budget where I'm working with municipal government that I work for, and it's very transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2051.882s">This</a>  is where I find my frustration that what Councilor Bears just asked for is truly a press of a button of spreadsheets and really help everybody involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2064.091s">And</a>  again, that magic word of transparency, we use it, but I think we should follow it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2069.635s">So</a>  I think it's important that this initiative moves forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2075.059s">So</a>  I appreciate the efforts Vice President Bears and I move second on this paper, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2081.393s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2081.913s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2082.134s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2082.554s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2084.315s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2104.431s">they</a>  want to get more involved in municipal politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2108.253s">And</a>  oftentimes it can be really challenging to follow what's going on, especially when things are messy here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2116.776s">And</a>  so if we take the initiative, if we get ahead of this before the fiscal 24 budget season, then hopefully this helps people at home watching follow municipal politics even better.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2132.582s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2133.303s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2135.104s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2136.144s">Madam</a>  President, I just think it's important to point out that every action has a reaction, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2141.989s">And</a>  this whole process could be avoided if the mayor would just work with the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2150.655s">We</a>  wouldn't have to go through the process of creating legislation to direct the mayor to be transparent if she would work with the council and be a partner to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2159.881s">So,</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2162.369s">Imagine</a>  that we've gotten to the point where the council now has to rise to take legislative action to get the man to communicate us to communicate with us effectively when it comes down to the finances of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2173.814s">I</a>  mean, I think that's where we are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2176.555s">That's</a>  how far this relationship is deteriorated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2179.396s">Now,</a>  I've been in the city my whole life. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2182.037s">You</a>  know, we've all heard the stories about what the council used to be like. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2185.704s">when</a>  there was fighting and screaming and yelling across the pit, everybody couldn't get along. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2190.668s">We</a>  get along relatively well here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2192.889s">This</a>  is probably the first time in 40 years that the council actually walks in unison on a lot of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2199.954s">More</a>  often than not, we're in agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2202.016s">And</a>  the one thing that we all agree on quite frequently is the lack of financial transparency in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2208.721s">So</a>  I just think it's important to point out that the reason why the council has taken these steps <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2215.022s">is</a>  because the council isn't being provided with the tools or the opportunity to be successful in their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2220.725s">So</a>  we need to pass ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2222.526s">We</a>  need to make laws telling the mayor to communicate with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2226.568s">Think</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2227.308s">How</a>  outrageous that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2228.349s">That's</a>  where we've, that's what we've come to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2231.17s">And</a>  that's where the relationship has deteriorated to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2234.052s">That's</a>  the level of respect that the coroner's office gives this body that's been elected by the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2239.795s">So</a>  I thank Councilor Bears for taking a proactive approach.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2243.512s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2244.052s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2244.692s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2246.153s">Thank</a>  you to my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2247.933s">Just</a>  if I could make one amendment and strike a 2023 and put FY24. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2252.134s">That</a>  was just an error on my part.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2255.494s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2257.935s">So</a>  on the motion of Vice President Bears, as amended by Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2262.916s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Jack Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2263.616s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2264.476s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2265.416s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2266.137s">22-058</a>  offered by Vice President Bears and Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2271.118s">I'm</a>  going to read this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2277.339s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2278.659s">I</a>  remember the marijuana ordinance 71 pages being read so I don't know what the motion to suspend the reading in favor of a summary on the motion advice was embarrassed to suspend the reading in favor of a summary I will go to Councilor Collins has been working steadfast on this for a summary to be provided to the council.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2297.667s">Thank</a>  you President Earl I'd be happy to provide a summary of this ordinance and a summary of the process that has gotten us to where we are today. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2304.15s">I'm</a>  very gratified to be able to put this ordinance forward for first reading the council has been discussing modifying and evolving this ordinance for almost a full year, almost a full year now in the public health and community safety subcommittee and committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2318.027s">and</a>  in one-on-one conversations with city administration, our chief of police, and other department heads, legal experts, and with community advocates. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2325.431s">This</a>  ordinance is about being proactive to safeguard our community against nascent, privately developed surveillance technologies, which are both rapidly evolving and severely underregulated at the state and federal levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2336.918s">I</a>  think this is a very exciting moment for this council and for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2341.24s">While</a>  we would be far from the first city to have a CCOPS ordinance, Medford has the chance to be a real leader here and a model for other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2349.123s">This</a>  ordinance, with the inclusion of some floor amendments that I'm going to propose in a minute, presents a clear and a structured way for the community, the City Council, and the administration to communicate and to collaborate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2360.968s">The</a>  outcome of that communication and collaboration <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2364.022s">will</a>  be the development of use policies and parameters for surveillance technologies now and in the future that are properly weighed benefits and the risks of these technologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2372.529s">When</a>  we do choose to put surveillance technology to use in our city, we will know that we have had the intentional conversations about costs and benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2379.694s">We</a>  will have discussed the potential risks and the helpful benefits and how to balance both so as to safeguard community members against threats to personal privacy, civil liberty, and over-surveillance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2390.262s">As</a>  a city council, we will know that we have a guaranteed seat at the table when potentially large impacts to our constituents' lives and potentially huge purchases are decided. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2399.245s">We</a>  will have a clear and a structured way to let this people's forum be a people's forum on these very real 21st century issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2406.507s">And</a>  we will be able to guarantee that our constituents have a chance to ask questions and to be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2410.869s">Surveillance</a>  technology is already in use in communities around America. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2414.19s">There's</a>  no turning back the clock on this new class of corporate technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2417.531s">However,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2418.512s">We</a>  can do what we can under our local purview to take this as an opportunity to involve the public to hear from experts and to build trust between our government and our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2427.797s">So</a>  the version of the ordinance that we'll be voting on tonight is the product of four years of advocacy by the community coalition behind it, and months of discussion among city council and the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2438.502s">Since</a>  March of last year we have substantially modified added to and subtracted from the original draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2443.985s">These</a>  changes centered around paring down the reporting requirements to make this ordinance more manageable, making it more clear that routine office tools are not considered surveillance technology, and also clarifying the reporting requirements are to be high level and general rather than onerous and granular. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2461.587s">Throughout</a>  this process we have had productive good faith conversations with this administration, especially this chief of police in those conversations we've been able to address a number of outstanding concerns that were raised even after this ordinance was reported at committee, and I know that no document is perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2477.976s">And</a>  there are partners within and without of this administration, who have, who would have preferred different approaches to certain aspects of this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2485.34s">Still</a>  I'm grateful that we seem to have reached an agreement across a broad range of stakeholders on a set of amendments that we believe would make this ordinance doable workable for this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2495.307s">And</a>  there is a document before Councilors, along with the clean and also redlined versions of the <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2501.503s">ordinance</a>  tonight, outlining the floor amendments that we intend to propose, and I will move that they be adopted prior to us taking a vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2510.968s">So,</a>  to sum up, I believe this has been a collaborative process helping us craft what I think is the most Medford tailored version of this ordinance that we could have arrived at. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2520.186s">In</a>  short, this ordinance would advance the goals of transparency, accountability, community participation, and trust building, goals that we all share, within a scope that our department heads can accomplish within their existing duties. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2532.842s">I</a>  thank my fellow Councilors for their deference with my preamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2537.801s">and</a>  I ask for your support tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2539.103s">And</a>  President Morell, I know that there are audience members here to speak on the ordinance, and I would ask if you'd be willing to invite them up to speak after my co-sponsor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2547.978s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

Medford People Power and all of the organizations and individuals who came together to initiate this process, move it forward, have many, many community meetings and forums and discussions and conversations about getting it to where we are tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2581.61s">And</a>  I also want to acknowledge and thank the city administration and Chief Buckley for the many conversations that we've had to get to a place where we feel that this is something that we can enact, given the capacity of city staff and to address outstanding concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2601.934s">I</a>  also want to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2605.18s">you</a>  know, one of the things that we talk about in government is when, you know, when you're trying to reach a compromise between parties who have different positions on issues, usually the end result is something that nobody is 100% ecstatic about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2618.071s">And</a>  I think this, after we put the amendments forward tonight, I think that this document will reflect that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2624.977s">And</a>  I say that because <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2627.859s">it's</a>  reaching an agreement between their stakeholders, again, with different approaches and thoughts around how this should be enacted, but also that as we move forward through this process, the intent of the ordinance is that it be long lasting and also that it adapt to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2644.352s">And</a>  as the council considers surveillance reports for the first time, as the community adapts to changes in technology and <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2656.225s">all</a>  of the different things that come around them rapidly changing and growing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2661.245s">and</a>  surveillance technology environment across the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2667.167s">I</a>  think we're going to have to come back and look at pieces of this, you know, in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2670.188s">So</a>  I just want to put that out there, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2672.369s">And</a>  the great thing about this is that I really think it creates a strong foundation for us to have those conversations, to build trust and understanding in what the city is doing around these technologies that are <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2687.158s">you</a>  know, in many cases, new and unknown and have impacts and consequences that can't be foreseen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2697.184s">So</a>  that creating of a community process and a forum and a place for members of the Medford community to directly discuss what their local government is going to be doing when it comes to surveillance technology, I think is an incredibly important thing for us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2712.593s">And</a>  then I completely agree with Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2716.254s">that</a>  the state and federal governments are not taking the approach they need to take on us, and so it's up to local government to do so, and that local government is generally tends to be the level of government that has the most direct impact, the most direct interaction with people in their everyday lives, and that's the place where <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2735.005s">In</a>  many cases, surveillance could be the most impactful and could have the most negative impacts if not done correctly and not done with community control. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2742.391s">So</a>  really thankful to Councilor Collins again for your leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2747.416s">If</a>  I may, I'd like to just propose that we amend, propose the 12 following amendments to the ordinance on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2756.083s">The</a>  first would be to strike some language from section 50-70. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2761.15s">to</a>  provide protocols for use of surveillance technology or surveillance data that includes specific steps 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2766.573s">The</a>  second is to strike and remove section 5071 C and D and adopt the updated section numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2774.298s">The</a>  third is to strike and remove the following language from section 5071 F and 5071 G subsection 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2783.163s">and</a>  those language removals would be or significant property damage or loss and will be, and the phrase and will be used only in the surface of code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2791.065s">I'd</a>  like to further propose following amendments to adopt amendments, add new subsection to section 50-72, which would be B, body-worn cameras shall be exempt from section 50-72 of this ordinance until January 1st, 2028. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2805.667s">Add</a>  a new subsection.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2810.103s">Can</a>  I just repeat that I missed that but you said it's going to put off the use of body one police cameras.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2815.589s">No,</a>  it's actually going to exempt our approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2817.811s">Those,</a>  if those were to be used by the city they would not have to be approved by the city council for five years until January 1 2028. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2829.43s">And</a>  that would also add to the section 50-73 the same clause, 50-74 the same clause, technical amendment to 50-74 subsection A to change the language to no later than 90 days following the effective date of this ordinance or prior to implementation of any new surveillance technology use covered by this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2849.992s">strike</a>  the first sentence of section 50 77 B and replace it with scope and intentions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2855.013s">The</a>  annual surveillance report is to provide a written report on an annual basis that contains a high level and generalized summary of policies and usages concerning surveillance technology used by any city department during the previous year and containing the information set forth in section 50 dash 77 of this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2871.397s">The</a>  eighth amendment is to strike and remove section 50 dash 77 C subsections four, five and nine and update the section numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2879.638s">Ninth</a>  Amendment is to strike section 50-79B and replace with B cause of action. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2884.32s">Any</a>  violation of this ordinance constitutes an injury and any person may institute proceedings for injunctive relief, declaratory relief or writ of mandate in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2895.785s">Any</a>  actions instituted under this paragraph shall be brought against the city and if necessary to effectuate compliance with this ordinance, any other governmental agency with possession, custody or control of data subject to this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2907.002s">striking</a>  the following sentence from section 59 C and this is due to federal and state Supreme State court rulings that this can't be done by ordinance would be striking the sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2917.467s">A</a>  court shall award costs and reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiff who is the prevailing party in an action brought to enforce this ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2924.317s">We'd</a>  also strike in a move section 5080 and update the section numbers to reflect that and finally strike section 5081 and replace it with, quote, it shall be unlawful for the city to enter into any contract for monetary value with a commercial entity that provides the city with a mass acquisition of privately generated and own bulk surveillance data, any contracts or agreements signed prior to the enactment of this ordinance that violate this section shall not be renewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2946.712s">After</a>  the completion of the term of said contracts or agreements, Section 5080 shall not apply to contracts or agreements executed for law enforcement operations or purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2955.127s">And</a>  those are the amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2957.271s">Can</a>  the clerk read those back, please?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2961.739s">You're</a>  welcome to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2963.76s">The</a>  way I look at this matter.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2964.66s">I</a>  think he has it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2965.861s">Yeah,</a>  I thought you asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2967.702s">He</a>  has it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2968.382s">No,</a>  I would not. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2969.763s">Because</a>  right now I think that what we have in front of us is an 11 page ordinance with 12 amendments, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2974.646s">This</a>  is craziness. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2975.526s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2975.726s">This</a>  isn't even something that's really important to the operation of our local government, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2979.528s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2980.349s">We</a>  spent a lot of time, energy and effort working on something when I think we could have really been working on something else that matters to more people in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2986.692s">I</a>  understand that there's a group of people that care about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2988.893s">I'm</a>  not really one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2991.174s">I</a>  don't think that this is something that's vital to the future of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=2995.835s">Quite</a>  frankly, I think that it does things that can kind of hamstrung our ability to move forward and to promote a vision that adopts technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3004.018s">When</a>  we sit down, when we first started talking about this ordinance, chat GPT wasn't a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3008.959s">And</a>  now look what it is, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3010.38s">So</a>  in a very short period of time, technology has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3013.782s">And</a>  quite frankly, when we codify something in an ordinance, the government process is designed to move slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3019.245s">And</a>  by codifying this in ordinance, I think what it's going to do is hamstring us in our ability to adapt the technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3025.768s">So</a>  it's really not something that I want to support this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3028.97s">You</a>  know, I think when we're looking at the direction that we're going in here in the community, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3036.204s">We're</a>  working on a lot of things, but the results that the people want to see that I talk to are in the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3046.627s">They're</a>  on the ground, they're on the sidewalks, they're in the delivery of services. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3051.388s">So</a>  while I can appreciate the work that's gone into this, it's not gonna be able to support this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3055.209s">And</a>  I asked my council colleagues to really think long and hard about an 11 page ordinance with 12 amendments on the floor, and whether or not that's a good transparent public process for us to take hold of and move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3067.511s">I</a>  understand that the gentleman put a lot of work into it, as well as the lady, my colleague said I did an excellent job on this ordinance, don't get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3072.792s">It's</a>  just something that I have problems with, <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3077.109s">theoretically.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3078.53s">So</a>  for those reasons, I will be supporting the paper this evening.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3081.331s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3085.133s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3086.014s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins, Councilor Villes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3088.935s">I</a>  know this took a lot of time, but I've been steadfast in my <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3095.152s">my</a>  view of our business and the lack of legal representation that could guide this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3103.515s">And</a>  without that, that's one of the many reasons why I can't support this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3109.736s">Like</a>  Councilor Knight said, there are 12 amendments of an ordinance that needs to be changed and how that affects the technology piece, not just this situation, but moving forward in other situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3122.897s">Again,</a>  I'm gonna say this again, Councilor Knight put it one way, I'll put it the way that I've been saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3129.999s">We've</a>  been trying to do the city's business without a city attorney that represents this council, that guides us on ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3139.922s">The</a>  recommendations from KP Law, I don't even know if they would be valid for the fact that they don't work for this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3148.193s">So</a>  any legal information that we need to back from dealing with the legality of this or any of the questions that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3159.698s">I</a>  really can't trust or depend on, and to support this right now would be no different than any of the other papers that I've not voted for because of the lack of legal guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3170.225s">So</a>  I hope you can understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3172.506s">I</a>  appreciate the hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3173.727s">I</a>  know that this took a lot of work, and I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7G1mRGUN6Dk&t=3177.85s">So</a>  thank you.</p>
