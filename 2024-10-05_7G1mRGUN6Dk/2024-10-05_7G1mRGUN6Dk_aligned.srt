00:00:00,358 --> 00:00:05,343
The Medford City Council sent its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Russ Rosetti on his recent passing.

2
00:00:05,483 --> 00:00:08,726
Russ was a longtime supporter and board member of the Chevalier Auditorium.

3
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:10,928
His presence in our community will be sorely missed.

4
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:11,808
Councilor Carviello.

5
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:12,829
Thank you, Madam President.

6
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:20,516
For those of you who don't know Russ, Russ was part of the core group that kept Chevalier open.

7
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:24,060
during the years when there was really nothing going on there.

8
00:00:25,502 --> 00:00:30,127
And he was a tireless volunteer, chaired this country in the Air Force as a veteran.

9
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:36,034
But part of the reason we still have Shabai here today is because of the efforts of Russ and his group.

10
00:00:36,154 --> 00:00:41,220
So Madam President, I'd ask that we dedicate this meeting in his honor this evening.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,161
Thank you.

12
00:00:43,372 --> 00:00:44,173
Councilor Capelli.

13
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:45,314
Thank you, Councilor Capelli.

14
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:46,074
I'll bring it forward.

15
00:00:46,795 --> 00:00:49,077
A true gentleman.

16
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:55,722
Russ was someone that was a pillar of our community and will be greatly missed.

17
00:00:55,742 --> 00:00:59,084
So may he rest in peace.

18
00:00:59,224 --> 00:00:59,565
Thank you.

19
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:00,546
Thank you.

20
00:01:00,566 --> 00:01:02,047
Any other councilors wish to speak?

21
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:04,789
Mr. Kasichnay.

22
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:14,841
Now, do you want to push the button with the little person on it?

23
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:17,724
There's a little face on it.

24
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,365
There you go.

25
00:01:29,404 --> 00:01:31,406
Thank you future references a second.

26
00:01:32,667 --> 00:01:41,274
First of all, casting Eddie Andrew Christian Street, he's met.

27
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,156
I want to thank console cover your for bringing this up was.

28
00:01:44,857 --> 00:01:45,937
I knew Mr. Rossetti.

29
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:47,378
Russ was a great guy.

30
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,519
He probably still is a great guy.

31
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,281
And if I could, I'd like to commend him for all his volunteerisms for that Chevalier Commission.

32
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:59,662
It's been more than a decade, maybe two.

33
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:07,785
And it's amazing what that man did for the city and Chevalier.

34
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:11,386
I'd like to share a story he once told me.

35
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,963
As he grew up in the north end of Boston, he had an unfortunate accident.

36
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:21,265
He fell down an elevator shaft.

37
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:26,349
And from that day on, he had severe back pain.

38
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,053
And I don't even know how he got up and down the stairs in West Method.

39
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:37,216
So I really commend him for putting all his efforts forth.

40
00:02:38,203 --> 00:02:42,427
He's a great man, and he'll surely be missed.

41
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:43,848
Thank you for listening.

42
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:45,490
Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

43
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,153
On the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

44
00:02:49,193 --> 00:02:49,834
All those in favor?

45
00:02:49,974 --> 00:02:50,114
Aye.

46
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:50,915
All those opposed?

47
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:51,595
Motion passes.

48
00:02:51,695 --> 00:02:52,897
Please rise for a moment of silence.

49
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:09,298
23-035 offered by President Morrell and Councilor Seng.

50
00:03:09,418 --> 00:03:19,179
Be it resolved that the City Council celebrate this month as Black History Month and recognize the significant contributions that Black Medford residents have made in shaping our city and history and enriching our community life.

51
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,019
Councilor Seng.

52
00:03:20,179 --> 00:03:21,920
Thank you, President Morrell.

53
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:33,962
This February is Black History Month, and Medford, as many may know, has a very rich history when it comes to African Americans in the Northeast.

54
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:45,355
When we look at our West Bedford community in particular, that's a community that's been there for a very, very, very long time, pretty much since the city was founded.

55
00:03:47,666 --> 00:04:06,463
I personally have learned a lot by following on the West Bedford Community Center's Twitter account, where I believe every, it might be every day, but every few days they're tweeting out some, you know, something short and readable about a black Bedford resident who shaped

56
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:09,847
Medford and the surrounding region somehow.

57
00:04:10,528 --> 00:04:20,943
The count has talked about Black Medford residents who've served in our army, who fought for the Union, it's talked about athletes and their contributions to

58
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,930
to our society as well.

59
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:38,207
I also pulled up a list of a bunch of events that residents can attend if they want to learn more about Black history, want to learn more about their connection, the connection of the Black community to Medford.

60
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:51,935
This Friday, Medford High and Medford Vogue are holding their celebration of Black History Month at the high school at 1.30 p.m.

61
00:04:53,516 --> 00:04:55,917
Our school districts historically held this event and

62
00:04:56,817 --> 00:05:00,319
There will be music, there will be dance performances and guest speakers as well.

63
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:07,762
And on Saturday, the West Bedford Community Center is hosting the Black Entrepreneurs Showcase and Sale from 12 p.m.

64
00:05:07,802 --> 00:05:15,245
to 4 p.m., where you can look at artisans and crafts and gifts that you can buy and gift the family as well.

65
00:05:16,086 --> 00:05:25,190
The Human Rights Commission is hosting an event titled An Oath to Belinda Sutton on Saturday, February the 25th at the Royal House.

66
00:05:26,498 --> 00:05:27,198
from 1 p.m.

67
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:41,947
to 3.30 p.m., and on Tuesday, the 28th, so the last day of the month, the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is hosting a lunch and hosting conversations here in the city hall chambers.

68
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:43,548
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

69
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:46,790
All I was going to say and more, thank you for sharing those events.

70
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,712

00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:13,835
Councilor Kerrio.

00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:14,616

80

I want to just congratulate these, uh, these three fine people on their rise up to the ladder of through the fire department.

81
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:30,310
Young Frank is following in the steps of his dad is now deputy chief and, uh, Aaron, um, the captain.

82
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:39,418
So I think we have a good young core of firemen moving up the ladder and just want to congratulate them for all their work that they've done to get their promotion.

83
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:39,538
So

84
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:43,405
Thank you.

85
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:57,798
Thank you very much on these three firefighters bring a wealth of experience to the field, and I think that other city methods a safer place by having them being elevated to these positions of leadership so I'd like to congratulate them all and wish them a very successful and safe future to them and their families.

107
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:39,012
And it's an initial discussion and brainstorm, and there'll be further meetings to come when I move approval.

108
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:40,233

All those opposed, which passes rules are suspended 23 dash 043, the electronic delivery to the President and members of the Medford City Council regarding request to establish a revolving fund for stormwater.

139
00:10:12,673 --> 00:10:25,518
Dear President Morelle, members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approve the following amendment to Charter 2, Article 5, I'm dying, I've had a long day, Division 4 of the city's ordinances by adopting the following change.

140
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:33,080
The table in section 2-964, authorized revolving funds, shall be amended to include a stormwater revolving fund as per the enclosed table.

141
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:40,823
Enclosed is a letter from City Engineer and Stormwater Board Chair, Owen Martella, which outlines this request and provides supporting documentation.

142
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:53,707
Finally, I'm in closing a memorandum by Finance Director Ayer, Bob Dickinson, which provides the necessary certification pursuant to MGL Chapter 44, Section 53E and a half for establishing a revolving fund in the middle of a fiscal year.

143
00:10:54,107 --> 00:10:58,389
City Engineer Owen Wartella will be available to speak to this request and answer any questions you may have.

144
00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:01,031
Sincerely, thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

145
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:02,411
Sincerely, Brown and Woodford Mayor.

146
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:06,695
I for one feels this is a good expense.

147
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:20,925
I mean, I mean a good, a good initiative and a good endeavor because we look at the way that city's been spending money, lack of financial transparency anytime that we can set up a revolving fund or a trust fund to be sure that that money is being spent where it's supposed to be spent I think would make sense.

148
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:31,453
So, by approving this we're actually providing an additional check and balance and additional control on the frivolous and wasteful spending that we're seeing that's coming out of the administration and the lack of transparency that was coming out of administration.

149
00:11:32,153 --> 00:11:34,499
So by approving this, we're going to be creating another layer of oversight.

150
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,702
I think that's a good thing.

151
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:36,444
So I'd move for approval.

152
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:37,627
Thank you.

153
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:38,008
That's right.

154
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:39,072
and President.

155
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:48,815
Again, I think that I think Councilor Knight bringing those words up, I think that it's important when we're looking at it with the oversight that's needed.

156
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,676
Again, it's the only reason why I am voting for it.

157
00:11:52,796 --> 00:12:05,080
Anything like I said, that deals with any fiscal responsibility or requests in this body, I would not support for the fact that we still have no idea of our fiscal future here.

158
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,180
in the city.

159
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,442
We have no, had no discussions with the mayor of the administration and guide us where we are financially.

160
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:18,424
So again, that's a dire situation, but I would support this paper.

161
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:18,684
Thank you.

162
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:19,864
Thank you, Councilor Capelli.

163
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:20,704
Vice President Behrs.

164
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:21,585
Thank you, Madam President.

165
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:27,926
I just wanted to see if Engineer Wirtala had any kind of short summary of what this is and what the Stormwater Board has been doing.

166
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:31,547
Hello.

167
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:33,008
Thank you for having me.

168
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:38,126
This is just a, we're setting up a stormwater regulations.

169
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:44,091
There's new stormwater regulations that the city is required to do by federal law because we dump it to the Mystic River.

170
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:53,039
This is a, there is a fee going to be associated with that permit, and we need a revolving account to be associated with that fee.

171
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:57,023
Great, any questions from the council?

172
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:00,844
questions from the public.

173
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:07,586
Seeing none, so on the motion, Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli for first reading.

174
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:08,326
Mr. Clerk.

175
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:10,127
Does this require first reading?

176
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:10,747
It's not in order.

177
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:13,067
Oh, I guess it is in order.

178
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:14,008
Sorry, my apologies.

179
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,728
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you are ready.

180
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:16,809
Yes.

181
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:18,809
Councilor Kerrio?

182
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:19,189
Yes.

183
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:22,430
Councilor Collins?

184
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,351
Councilor Knight?

185
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:26,911
Yes.

186
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:28,672
Councilor Scarpelli?

187
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:29,472
Yes.

188
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:36,167
Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

189
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:37,948
The motion passes for first reading.

190
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:39,449
Thank you.

191
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:41,169
Yeah, sorry, okay, one at a time.

192
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:42,070
23-039?

193
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,850
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,811
What was that one?

195
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,231
Okay, all right.

196
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:09,522
All right, I'll start with, I'll just order.

197
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:20,095
23-038 offered by Councilor Knight, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request the city administration to deploy pothole crews to pass roadways with priority to emergency arteries in the city of Medford.

198
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:21,826
Thank you very much.

199
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:26,572
No, thank you for sticking around to hear a couple of these resolutions that are on the agenda this evening.

200
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:29,915
Ultimately, the condition of our roadways in the city of deplorable.

201
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:38,125
I think you know what I think we all know, right, you could drive in front of Bob's food store for the past five years, and the bottle hasn't been

202
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:42,069
patched even, never mind a plan to fix it.

203
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:53,242
You'll drive around the Winthrop Street Rotary going down High Street and you'll cross over the first pedestrian crosswalk there and ever since the first Eversource project, the

204
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:58,375
Crosswalk has been sunken in for now eight, nine years now.

205
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:02,257
I know our DPW, I know our commissioner, I know our mayor drives down these roads.

206
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:11,864
So I know that they know the condition of these roadways is terrible, but we need to develop some sort of plan, some sort of methodology for how we're gonna attack this.

207
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,346
We have C-Click fix and we have 50 DPW members.

208
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:22,551
I don't see why we can't take them all one day and say, get on the roads, drive down our emergency arteries and document each pothole that's on there and then we can put a plan together.

209
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:28,372
on how do we can patch these emergency arteries saving ultimately these the roads that our emergency vehicles drive down or EMS vehicles drive down.

210
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:35,154
You know, when there's a snow emergency, these are the vehicles that we're not allowed to park on, because these streets are used for public safety purposes.

211
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:36,895
So I think that it's something that we need to take a look at.

212
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:41,656
And I'm hoping that through the leadership of your office, you'll be able to come up with a plan on how we can address that.

213
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,436
Thank you, Councillor Nye.

214
00:15:44,036 --> 00:15:45,897
Any other Councillors wish to speak before

215
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:48,254
Thank you, Madam President.

216
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:49,875
I want to thank Councilor for putting this on.

217
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:51,035
I agree.

218
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:52,476
I think we all drive down the streets.

219
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:55,417
We're all getting the same calls about the holes.

220
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:57,117
They just keep getting bigger and bigger.

221
00:15:57,937 --> 00:16:02,459
We patched them, especially when you get this hot weather and cold weather.

222
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,019
patch comes out.

223
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:16,968
So I agree with Councilor Layton, some type of plan has to be come up with to at least get the emergency arteries into some kind of shape that people don't keep getting flat tires.

224
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:21,110
Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

225
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,652
Chief Engineer Ortel, do you have anything you could share?

226
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:25,773
I have nothing to add.

227
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:27,975
I'm here for questions, if you have any.

228
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,016
Any specific questions from the Council?

229
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:33,574
I have one.

230
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:40,218
Golden Ave has been a topic of discussion now for going in the better part of five years.

231
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:48,242
We appropriated some money to have the underground infrastructure of Golden Ave repaired and then also have the above ground infrastructure of Golden Ave repaired.

232
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:51,204
And I think that was supposed to take place over the summer.

233
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:54,265
Do you have any idea what's going on with that project?

234
00:16:56,947 --> 00:17:00,189
I really wasn't prepared to speak on those things.

235
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:01,990
I will get you the information.

236
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,310
Thank you.

237
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,352
Any other questions from the council?

238
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:11,353
We'll take you for public, we'll take you.

239
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:15,935
All right, so Mr. Wardeller, if you want to, Mr. Casagnani, if you want to come up and speak.

240
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:33,643
Yeah, since this subject has come up again and again and again, I recollect when Councilor De La Ruza was here, he called the plot holes plot holders.

241
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,693
But anyways, I brought this up years ago.

242
00:17:37,713 --> 00:17:46,861
I kind of understand why you fix a pothole, and then it regurgitates, and it becomes a pothole again after it was patched.

243
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:48,642
I brought this up years ago.

244
00:17:49,162 --> 00:18:04,035
Maybe we should reach out to other TPW yachts, such as Buffalo, New York, or Montreal, Quebec, wherever, someplace in Maine, where they have probably more potholes than we have, since they probably use more salt.

245
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:11,898
If I DPW could reach out our administration, maybe there's a better way to build a mousetrap.

246
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:23,972
Maybe if you cut them at an angle, what a task skills are, I'm not sure, whether it's slanted in or slanted out, or different type of material.

247
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,703
but it seems like we're fighting mother nature and it's the same old song and dance.

248
00:18:29,163 --> 00:18:33,547
I've also lost two tires on the old 2155 out streets.

249
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:41,072
I have yet to put in to get paid for one, but I think this time it's more time.

250
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:47,877
And of course, Councilor Knight lost two at one shot on Mystic Avenue, but you gotta pay attention out there too.

251
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:49,999
Good memory, thank you.

252
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,164
So on the motion of Councilor Night, seconded by Councilor Carvalho, all those in favor?

253
00:18:56,784 --> 00:18:57,485
All those opposed?

254
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:58,165
Motion passes.

255
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:01,148
23-039 offered by Councilor Carvalho.

256
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:08,794
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the city engineer report back with the repaving schedule for Bower, Holton, Temple, and Tontine streets this spring.

257
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:15,499
Be it further resolved that the public utilities pave curb to curb similar to the same standards private contractors are held to when they open the streets.

258
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:17,163
Thank you, Madam President.

259
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:19,724
I guess we're doing Ellington Street now.

260
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:20,705
I see that's open.

261
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:24,808
Do we have a schedule of when these streets are going to be paved?

262
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:28,671
I mean, I'm assuming they're going to be paved crib to crib, correct?

263
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:34,575
Because we're holding private contractors and making them pave crib to crib when they open the street.

264
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:37,017
So public utilities should be up to the same standard.

265
00:19:38,738 --> 00:19:44,162
By law, they're only allowed to repave their trench.

266
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:49,495
We've this council passed a resolution seven years ago, when Council March is here.

267
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:54,517
My understanding is that the state Supreme Court ruled that all they have to do is repave the trench.

268
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:58,940
Now I know that Engrid has done more than that.

269
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,982
Our city standard is going usually one foot beyond the trench.

270
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:10,887
And they tend to take a lane because it's another foot, you know, and their trenches and usually straight.

271
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,489
So why is it when a private contractor puts a pipe in the street?

272
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,229
They have to pave the whole street.

273
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:17,330
They have to pave crib to crib.

274
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,290
That's a private contractor you're talking about.

275
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,751
The rules should be the same for everybody.

276
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:23,211
I agree.

277
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:24,711
Rules should be the same for everybody.

278
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:35,073
I mean, these companies are coming in, they're destroying our streets, and we get sinkholes, and they come in, they're gone, and six months later, it's all sunk in, they never come back and fix it.

279
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:41,855
So they typically do a cold patch, or not cold patch, they do a temporary trench, and then they come back and they do a resurfacing.

280
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:49,379
Typically, six months after they do the work in that six months falls within the winter moratorium, then it goes to the next spring.

281
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:51,300
We have been with tomorrow.

282
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,182
Why are we digging up during with the moratorium, because it's over 40 degrees and it's warm.

283
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,003
In the past, we've never done that before.

284
00:20:57,023 --> 00:21:07,388
We've always that you should take that up with the TDW commissioner because I don't think it's right that these these companies to on health to the same standards that the private companies are held so it's not it's just not fair.

285
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,900
President Behrs.

286
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,961
Thank you, Madam President.

287
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:20,906
I mean, I think what we're hearing is that we all agree that the public utility should be held to a higher standard, but that the state law says that they don't have to be, and we don't control that.

288
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:21,726
So, you know.

289
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:23,267
It's not a city project.

290
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:26,069
This is Engrid doing their gas main replacement.

291
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:28,490
I do know that it's not gonna be in the spring.

292
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,933
It'll probably be summer or fall before they come back and do the resurfacing for those roads.

293
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:38,896
And they're very narrow roads, so we'll see how wide those repaving efforts are.

294
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:43,936
Any other questions, Council night.

295
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:52,745
One thing I want to talk about in the past I've spoken about with Tim when he was the city engineer was, you know, some sort of mitigation agreement.

296
00:21:53,526 --> 00:21:57,650
When these public utilities come to our community and dig up our streets and that.

297
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:05,762
expect to leave their supplies their equipment, their stock on public ways or on public passes.

298
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:10,749
So that's one way I think that we can look at this right if they want to leave the ticket stuff and get it out of here.

299
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:14,357
On and grits case.

300
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:20,141
Yeah, this one has some stuff parked on Thomas, that wasn't the arrangement for that.

301
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:26,206
There have been mitigation agreements, especially with the Walnut Street Metcalfe roads.

302
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:28,728
I know it's been done in the past we use a spot.

303
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:40,038
So I think that that's something that if we look at strengthening those mitigation agreements, I think that might be able to be a way that we can expand that patch on the roadway to maybe go a little bit further than a foot.

304
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:47,825
Yeah, we did just receive an updated projected list for the 23 through 26 season of the integrated proposed works.

305
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:56,192
And so we will try to pair that up with our own repaving efforts so that we get more utilities in and repaving done.

306
00:22:56,771 --> 00:23:00,217
in accordance with this so we can save a little bit of money and stretch our funds.

307
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:01,158
We could post it on the website?

308
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:02,981
It will be.

309
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:04,724
Steve Smyrna is on my case about it.

310
00:23:04,844 --> 00:23:05,145
Yes.

311
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:05,726
Okay, excellent.

312
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:06,467
Thank you very much.

313
00:23:08,938 --> 00:23:10,099
Thank you for being here.

314
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:23,086
The question I have is, as I know in the past before your entry to this wonderful position, we had a question we had with all the road work that's being managed throughout this community.

315
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:31,450
How have we set it up that since we don't have a clerk of the works, how do we manage

316
00:23:34,185 --> 00:23:42,752
the work of one, let's say, National Grid comes in, sets a trench, leaves, who's monitoring that at the end of the project?

317
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:45,975
Because that's typically been the issue, that we just don't have enough people.

318
00:23:46,355 --> 00:23:56,243
Right, and we actually, our DPW staff is really great about reporting issues to us, the whole, and residents too, everyone kind of chips in.

319
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:10,115
keeps eyes on things and we tend to find out what's so but we don't have anything formal like in place where it says, you know, we have an alert systems is job, you know, job, job, a from National Grid, public street.

320
00:24:10,435 --> 00:24:19,721
Yeah, internally, we do track the permits and what's been going on and what is right, you know, been allowed the MSEs is a great way for us to track it internally.

321
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:24,202
so that when the springtime happens, we can say, okay, you were- We have to go check it.

322
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:26,303
It's time to repave and resurface.

323
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:26,683
Yeah.

324
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:27,223
All right, perfect.

325
00:24:27,303 --> 00:24:27,663
Thank you.

326
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:29,683
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

327
00:24:29,923 --> 00:24:31,344
Any other discussion from the council?

328
00:24:34,544 --> 00:24:38,685
Seeing none, so on the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by- So moved.

329
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:40,426
Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

330
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:41,006
Aye.

331
00:24:41,086 --> 00:24:41,886
All those opposed?

332
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:42,746
Motion passes.

333
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:44,567
Thank you, Owen.

334
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:47,207
We are still under suspension.

335
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:48,268
Motion to reverse.

336
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:48,368
Okay.

337
00:24:49,874 --> 00:24:52,461
What number is that? 23042.

338
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:57,597
Oh, there is.

339
00:24:57,617 --> 00:25:04,102
23042 offered by Councilor Carvalho, be it resolved that the Medford City Council reach out to our federal delegation in regards to the continued problems at the Medford Post Office.

340
00:25:04,162 --> 00:25:04,803
Councilor Carvalho.

341
00:25:05,223 --> 00:25:06,084
Thank you, Madam President.

342
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:16,092
I know we didn't get something from the Mayor's office today in regards to this, but I'm sure we're all getting the calls from everybody about not getting mail for two or three days.

343
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:23,458
And all I could ask is that this council send something to our federal delegation and that we urge people to

344
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:31,204
I'll call on Catherine Clark, Congressman Clark, Senator Maki, Senator Warren, et cetera.

345
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:34,787
If we could send something to my end, I know the mayor has been working on it too.

346
00:25:35,227 --> 00:25:37,009
So if that could be done, it'd be appreciated.

347
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,370
Thank you, Councilor Carmiel.

348
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:44,255
Madam President, might as well just go with the last two, if we can.

349
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:44,575
Sure.

350
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:44,575
23040.

351
00:25:44,615 --> 00:25:48,098
Sure, Mr. Kasich, do you want to speak on the post office?

352
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:53,104
This is my last one, I'm going home.

353
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:54,986
We'll see you online.

354
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,649
Probably.

355
00:25:58,569 --> 00:25:59,270
What's the subject?

356
00:25:59,290 --> 00:25:59,771
Remind me.

357
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:02,293
Post office.

358
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:03,174
Thank you, Counselor.

359
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:08,499
I want to say factually, my wife has a habit.

360
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:20,019
of sending birthday cards and Easter cards and Hanukkah cards and things of that nature to friends and associates.

361
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:22,600
And she usually slips in a couple of scratch tickets.

362
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:26,602
I think you probably know where I'm going.

363
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:28,103
This has been going on a few years.

364
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:32,266
She asked her friends, did you get my card?

365
00:26:32,846 --> 00:26:34,347
The answer is no, no.

366
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:38,889
So I find it very disconcerting that

367
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:47,583
When I was a kid, it was said that the meal must go through a range, so no sleep, shine.

368
00:26:48,544 --> 00:26:58,430
And I hate to think that something nefarious is going on in the postal office, but that's lousy.

369
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:03,208
And I'm sure there's some other stuff.

370
00:27:03,728 --> 00:27:16,033
As you know, in Melrose, the lady, I think we call her a lady, post office gal, was robbed at knife point by two hoodlums.

371
00:27:17,274 --> 00:27:26,458
And I guess what they wanted was, I didn't think she was carrying a 24-carat gold bullion, and she wasn't, but they wanted the key.

372
00:27:27,797 --> 00:27:30,359
the key to the city post office boxes.

373
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:42,369
Now I'm not sure when that happens, if the post office general immediately changes the locks and issues new keys at that instant.

374
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:49,840
Because in the old days, people would fish them out with chewing gum in a fishing rod, but they made them mailboxes.

375
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,462
So I kind of put a decent package in there.

376
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:56,626
I have to go to the post office physically to bring it in.

377
00:27:57,026 --> 00:28:06,294
So now when she tells me to mail these cards with scratch stickers in them, I go in the post office and put it into the slit where the sack is.

378
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:09,837
But I'm not sure if that even works.

379
00:28:11,152 --> 00:28:11,993
It's kind of sad.

380
00:28:13,174 --> 00:28:16,677
The state of the country, the state of some peoples, it's just not right.

381
00:28:17,318 --> 00:28:19,039
I hope they can do something about this.

382
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,563
Maybe put a tracker or some sort of technology chip or something.

383
00:28:24,164 --> 00:28:25,285
Find out what's going on.

384
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:27,747
Thank you for listening.

385
00:28:28,648 --> 00:28:29,909
Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

386
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:36,075
So on the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

387
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:49,463
All those opposed motion passes, going up to 23 dash 040 offered by Councilor Carvajal be resolved the Metro City Council request that the Recreation Department look into putting a port-a-potty at the pickleball courts at Duggar Park, Councilor Carvajal.

388
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:50,464
Thank you, Madam President.

389
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:55,048
I don't know if anybody has been driving around the city in the morning lately.

390
00:28:58,257 --> 00:29:06,279
We run between nine and 11, probably 50, 60 cars of people playing pickleball, which is just growing in leaps and bounds.

391
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:17,701
They've reached out to me, all the people that are playing there, senior citizens, and they're asking if they could be a part of a portal party there for them.

392
00:29:17,781 --> 00:29:26,243
So if we could ask that the recreation department look into putting a portal party somewhere over there for them, it would be greatly appreciated.

393
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:28,485
Thank you.

394
00:29:28,665 --> 00:29:32,836
I completely understand what you're asking for as a member of.

395
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:42,915
In our business, in the recreation business, when we're asking for what applies, it sounds great, but because of the pending snow and- And the spring.

396
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:43,815
And the issues.

397
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:46,036
They're not looking right this second.

398
00:29:46,056 --> 00:29:47,917
That was a confusion, so I think that, yeah.

399
00:29:47,977 --> 00:29:52,518
No, I think that anywhere there are parks, I think that I would second that.

400
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:59,240
You know, once we have, you know, during the spring season where we have the traffic that we have now at

401
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,981
Doug a park.

402
00:30:02,022 --> 00:30:03,223
I think it's important that we do.

403
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:11,277
Uh, you know, like you said, as you know, a lot of them seniors are there and they have a different needs than that.

404
00:30:11,297 --> 00:30:11,277
1000%.

405
00:30:11,317 --> 00:30:11,938
Thank you.

406
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:15,423
So I second the motion in further discussion.

407
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:19,588
On the motion of Councilor Carvalho, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

408
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:20,208
All those in favor?

409
00:30:20,228 --> 00:30:20,609
Aye.

410
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:21,429
All those opposed?

411
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:23,810
Motion passes.

412
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,170
23-041, offered by Councilor Carvalho.

413
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:30,092
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that DPW place a rubbish receptacle in front of the St.

414
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:30,732
Joseph's School.

415
00:30:30,772 --> 00:30:32,633
Councilor Carvalho.

416
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:34,254
Thank you, Madam President.

417
00:30:34,854 --> 00:30:36,655
The principal from St.

418
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:40,876
Joseph's has reached out to me and asked about putting a rubbish barrel in front of the school door.

419
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:44,578
They've asked in the past, but they've never thought of one.

420
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,861
They're not even, they said they will maintain it themselves.

421
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:51,382
They'll have their janitor empty the barrel.

422
00:30:51,402 --> 00:30:57,905
So if we can get one of those wireline barrels put there, because people at the bus stop are just leaving stuff there and kids are going swimming and stuff.

423
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:04,088
So again, if they can put a barrel there, the janitorial staff at St.

424
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,429
Joseph's will empty it themselves.

425
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:08,190
Thank you, Councilor Caraballo.

426
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,691
On the motion of Councilor Caraballo, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

427
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:12,392
All those in favor?

428
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:13,952
All those opposed?

429
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:14,733
Motion passes.

430
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,489
Are we taking every resolution that's not an ordinance?

431
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,271
Do you want to go back to the front now?

432
00:31:21,452 --> 00:31:25,956
We have one from you, Vice President Behrs, about the 23-037 we haven't taken.

433
00:31:27,578 --> 00:31:29,039
It's fine, you want to take it or it's fine?

434
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,082
Okay, good point.

435
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:38,668
On the motion of Vice President Behrs to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

436
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:39,749
All those opposed?

437
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:40,390
Motion passes.

438
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:56,751
23-037 offered by vice president bears it resolved by the city council that the city administration take the following steps relative to the city budget to ensure transparency accuracy of information and reporting, and that all boards and commissions have the budget information they need to function.

439
00:31:57,592 --> 00:32:02,817
One that the city of administration produce a 2023 budget book and clear go before the budget hearing start.

440
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:07,088
Two, that all commissions have binders as part of the budget book.

441
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:11,730
Three, that the city administration reinstate annual reports to be published at the beginning of each calendar year.

442
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:18,912
This will help the city prepare in advance for the budget process while providing a valuable source of transparent information about the city's budget activities.

443
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:21,973
Four, develop a one-sheet on financial processes.

444
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:37,784
policies budgeting for boards and commissions and share with all members of boards and commissions via further resolve at the subcommittee on ordinances and rules incorporate these recommendations and or any responses from state administration into the draft budget needs assessment ordinance currently being worked on by the subcommittee vice president bears.

445
00:32:37,945 --> 00:32:39,286
Thank you Madam President.

446
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:41,548
As folks know,

447
00:32:42,147 --> 00:32:44,870
We've had a fiscal 23 budget last year.

448
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:52,657
The process was less than ideal to be kind to the process, and there have been ongoing issues with us getting the information that we need.

449
00:32:53,158 --> 00:33:01,686
Since then, it's also come to my attention from members of various boards and commissions in the city that they don't feel that they have the information that they need around their budgets.

450
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:11,284
and that they have some concerns around what has happened to funding that they had and grant funding that has come in and things of that nature.

451
00:33:11,304 --> 00:33:18,007
I won't get more specific on that right now, but suffice it to say that boards and commissions

452
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:21,914
have serious concerns about the budget.

453
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:41,383
So these recommendations are to request that the city administration adjust their procedures and processes around the budget and finance and financial information to better inform boards and commissions of the status of their finances and in general to better inform the council and residents about the city budget, where we stand

454
00:33:42,644 --> 00:33:47,508
mid-year and getting that process going earlier and making sure everyone has the information they need.

455
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:51,011
So I would ask my colleagues to move approval.

456
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:53,053
Thank you, President Bares.

457
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,234
Any further discussion?

458
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:56,015
Councilor Scarpalli.

459
00:33:56,175 --> 00:34:03,802
I thank Vice President Bares for bringing this forward, but this is common practice in most municipal budgets.

460
00:34:05,383 --> 00:34:10,848
We're further along in our budget where I'm working with municipal government that I work for, and it's very transparent.

461
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:23,430
This is where I find my frustration that what Councilor Beers just asked for is truly a press of a button of spreadsheets and really help everybody involved.

462
00:34:24,091 --> 00:34:29,475
And again, that magic word of transparency, we use it, but I think we should follow it.

463
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:35,039
So I think it's important that this initiative moves forward.

464
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:41,023
So I appreciate the efforts Vice President Beers and I move second on this paper, thank you.

465
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:41,873
Thank you.

466
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,114
Thank you.

467
00:34:42,134 --> 00:34:42,534
Thank you.

468
00:34:42,554 --> 00:34:42,834
Thank you.

469
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:44,596
Thank you.

470
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:08,153
they want to get more involved in municipal politics.

471
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:16,716
And oftentimes it can be really challenging to follow what's going on, especially when things are messy here at City Hall.

472
00:35:16,776 --> 00:35:31,481
And so if we take the initiative, if we get ahead of this before the fiscal 24 budget season, then hopefully this helps people at home watching follow municipal politics even better.

473
00:35:32,582 --> 00:35:33,283
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

474
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:34,023
Any further discussion?

475
00:35:35,104 --> 00:35:35,484
Councilor Knight.

476
00:35:36,144 --> 00:35:41,668
Madam President, I just think it's important to point out that every action has a reaction, right?

477
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:49,173
And this whole process could be avoided if the mayor would just work with the council.

478
00:35:50,655 --> 00:35:58,140
We wouldn't have to go through the process of creating legislation to direct the mayor to be transparent if she would work with the council and be a partner to the council.

479
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:00,962
So, you know,

480
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:13,273
Imagine that we've gotten to the point where the council now has to rise to take legislative action to get the man to communicate us to communicate with us effectively when it comes down to the finances of this community.

481
00:36:13,814 --> 00:36:16,114
I mean, I think that's where we are right now.

482
00:36:16,555 --> 00:36:18,795
That's how far this relationship is deteriorated.

483
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:21,417
Now, I've been in the city my whole life.

484
00:36:22,037 --> 00:36:24,818
You know, we've all heard the stories about what the council used to be like.

485
00:36:25,704 --> 00:36:30,267
when there was fighting and screaming and yelling across the pit, everybody couldn't get along.

486
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:32,129
We get along relatively well here.

487
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:39,354
This is probably the first time in 40 years that the council actually walks in unison on a lot of items.

488
00:36:39,954 --> 00:36:41,456
More often than not, we're in agreement.

489
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:47,480
And the one thing that we all agree on quite frequently is the lack of financial transparency in this community.

490
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:53,885
So I just think it's important to point out that the reason why the council has taken these steps

491
00:36:55,022 --> 00:37:00,265
is because the council isn't being provided with the tools or the opportunity to be successful in their job.

492
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:02,486
So we need to pass ordinances.

493
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:05,788
We need to make laws telling the mayor to communicate with us.

494
00:37:06,568 --> 00:37:07,208
Think about that.

495
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,309
How outrageous that is.

496
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:11,150
That's where we've, that's what we've come to.

497
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,371
And that's where the relationship has deteriorated to.

498
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:19,354
That's the level of respect that the coroner's office gives this body that's been elected by the residents of this community.

499
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:22,276
So I thank Councilor Baez for taking a proactive approach.

500
00:37:23,512 --> 00:37:24,032
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

501
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:24,652
Vice President Behrs.

502
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:25,952
Thank you, Madam President.

503
00:37:26,153 --> 00:37:27,073
Thank you to my colleagues.

504
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:32,074
Just if I could make one amendment and strike a 2023 and put FY24.

505
00:37:32,134 --> 00:37:33,634
That was just an error on my part.

506
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:36,195
Any further discussion?

507
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:42,516
So on the motion of Vice President Behrs, as amended by Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

508
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:43,596
All those in favor?

509
00:37:43,616 --> 00:37:44,076
Aye.

510
00:37:44,476 --> 00:37:45,256
All those opposed?

511
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:46,117
Motion passes.

512
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:51,098
22-058 offered by Vice President Behrs and Councilor Collins.

513
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:52,758
I'm going to read this whole thing.

514
00:37:57,339 --> 00:37:58,499
Okay.

515
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:16,703
I remember the marijuana ordinance 71 pages being read so I don't know what the motion to suspend the reading in favor of a summary on the motion advice was embarrassed to suspend the reading in favor of a summary I will go to Councillor Collins has been working steadfast on this for a summary to be provided to the council.

516
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:24,130
Thank you President Earl I'd be happy to provide a summary of this ordinance and a summary of the process that has gotten us to where we are today.

517
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:37,437
I'm very gratified to be able to put this ordinance forward for first reading the council has been discussing modifying and evolving this ordinance for almost a full year, almost a full year now in the public health and community safety subcommittee and committee of the whole.

518
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:44,791
and in one-on-one conversations with city administration, our chief of police, and other department heads, legal experts, and with community advocates.

519
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:55,817
This ordinance is about being proactive to safeguard our community against nascent, privately developed surveillance technologies, which are both rapidly evolving and severely underregulated at the state and federal levels.

520
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:00,480
I think this is a very exciting moment for this council and for the city.

521
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:08,463
While we would be far from the first city to have a CCOPS ordinance, Medford has the chance to be a real leader here and a model for other communities.

522
00:39:09,123 --> 00:39:20,048
This ordinance, with the inclusion of some floor amendments that I'm going to propose in a minute, presents a clear and a structured way for the community, the City Council, and the administration to communicate and to collaborate.

523
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:23,049
The outcome of that communication and collaboration

524
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:31,888
will be the development of use policies and parameters for surveillance technologies now and in the future that are properly weighed benefits and the risks of these technologies.

525
00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:39,174
When we do choose to put surveillance technology to use in our city, we will know that we have had the intentional conversations about costs and benefits.

526
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:49,101
We will have discussed the potential risks and the helpful benefits and how to balance both so as to safeguard community members against threats to personal privacy, civil liberty, and over-surveillance.

527
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:58,585
As a city council, we will know that we have a guaranteed seat at the table when potentially large impacts to our constituents' lives and potentially huge purchases are decided.

528
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:05,847
We will have a clear and a structured way to let this people's forum be a people's forum on these very real 21st century issues.

529
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:10,108
And we will be able to guarantee that our constituents have a chance to ask questions and to be heard.

530
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:14,010
Surveillance technology is already in use in communities around America.

531
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,471
There's no turning back the clock on this new class of corporate technology.

532
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:17,831
However,

533
00:40:18,512 --> 00:40:26,876
We can do what we can under our local purview to take this as an opportunity to involve the public to hear from experts and to build trust between our government and our community.

534
00:40:27,797 --> 00:40:37,662
So the version of the ordinance that we'll be voting on tonight is the product of four years of advocacy by the community coalition behind it, and months of discussion among city council and the administration.

535
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:43,285
Since March of last year we have substantially modified added to and subtracted from the original draft.

536
00:40:43,985 --> 00:41:00,195
These changes centered around paring down the reporting requirements to make this ordinance more manageable, making it more clear that routine office tools are not considered surveillance technology, and also clarifying the reporting requirements are to be high level and general rather than onerous and granular.

537
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:17,122
Throughout this process we have had productive good faith conversations with this administration, especially this chief of police in those conversations we've been able to address a number of outstanding concerns that were raised even after this ordinance was reported at committee, and I know that no document is perfect.

538
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:24,720
And there are partners within and without of this administration, who have, who would have preferred different approaches to certain aspects of this ordinance.

539
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:34,146
Still I'm grateful that we seem to have reached an agreement across a broad range of stakeholders on a set of amendments that we believe would make this ordinance doable workable for this community.

540
00:41:35,307 --> 00:41:40,610
And there is a document before counselors, along with the clean and also redlined versions of the

541
00:41:41,503 --> 00:41:49,167
ordinance tonight, outlining the floor amendments that we intend to propose, and I will move that they be adopted prior to us taking a vote tonight.

542
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:58,793
So, to sum up, I believe this has been a collaborative process helping us craft what I think is the most Medford tailored version of this ordinance that we could have arrived at.

543
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:11,921
In short, this ordinance would advance the goals of transparency, accountability, community participation, and trust building, goals that we all share, within a scope that our department heads can accomplish within their existing duties.

544
00:42:12,842 --> 00:42:16,867
I thank my fellow counselors for their deference with my preamble.

545
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,063
and I ask for your support tonight.

546
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:27,638
And President Morrell, I know that there are audience members here to speak on the ordinance, and I would ask if you'd be willing to invite them up to speak after my co-sponsor.

547
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:28,299
Thank you.

548
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:29,420
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

549
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:30,542
Vices and bears.

550
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,351
Thank you, Madam President.

551
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:42,954
First, I just want to thank Councilor Collins for her incredible leadership over the past 14 or so months to advance the ball on this ordinance.

552
00:42:43,014 --> 00:42:59,938
And I also want to thank Medford People Power and all of the organizations and individuals who came together to initiate this process, move it forward, have many, many community meetings and forums and discussions and conversations about getting it to where we are tonight.

553
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:21,274
And I also want to acknowledge and thank the city administration and Chief Buckley for the many conversations that we've had to get to a place where we feel that this is something that we can enact, given the capacity of city staff and to address outstanding concerns.

554
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:23,515
I also want to say that

555
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:38,051
you know, one of the things that we talk about in government is when, you know, when you're trying to reach a compromise between parties who have different positions on issues, usually the end result is something that nobody is 100% ecstatic about.

556
00:43:38,071 --> 00:43:44,136
And I think this, after we put the amendments forward tonight, I think that this document will reflect that as well.

557
00:43:44,977 --> 00:43:46,758
And I say that because

558
00:43:47,859 --> 00:44:03,171
it's reaching an agreement between their stakeholders, again, with different approaches and thoughts around how this should be enacted, but also that as we move forward through this process, the intent of the ordinance is that it be long lasting and also that it adapt to change.

559
00:44:04,352 --> 00:44:14,440
And as the council considers surveillance reports for the first time, as the community adapts to changes in technology and

560
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:19,469
all of the different things that come around them rapidly changing and growing.

561
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:26,067
and surveillance technology environment across the world.

562
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:30,048
I think we're going to have to come back and look at pieces of this, you know, in the future.

563
00:44:30,188 --> 00:44:32,089
So I just want to put that out there, too.

564
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:46,134
And the great thing about this is that I really think it creates a strong foundation for us to have those conversations, to build trust and understanding in what the city is doing around these technologies that are

565
00:44:47,158 --> 00:44:56,964
you know, in many cases, new and unknown and have impacts and consequences that can't be foreseen.

566
00:44:57,184 --> 00:45:12,513
So that creating of a community process and a forum and a place for members of the Medford community to directly discuss what their local government is going to be doing when it comes to surveillance technology, I think is an incredibly important thing for us to do.

567
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:14,614
And then I completely agree with Councillor Collins.

568
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:33,868
that the state and federal governments are not taking the approach they need to take on us, and so it's up to local government to do so, and that local government is generally tends to be the level of government that has the most direct impact, the most direct interaction with people in their everyday lives, and that's the place where

569
00:45:35,005 --> 00:45:42,031
In many cases, surveillance could be the most impactful and could have the most negative impacts if not done correctly and not done with community control.

570
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:46,295
So really thankful to Councilor Collins again for your leadership.

571
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:55,182
If I may, I'd like to just propose that we amend, propose the 12 following amendments to the ordinance on the agenda.

572
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:58,685
The first would be to strike some language from section 50-70.

573
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:05,773
to provide protocols for use of surveillance technology or surveillance data that includes specific steps 2.

574
00:46:06,573 --> 00:46:13,337
The second is to strike and remove section 5071 C and D and adopt the updated section numbers.

575
00:46:14,298 --> 00:46:18,180
The third is to strike and remove the following language from section 5071 F and 5071 G subsection 3.

576
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:31,045
and those language removals would be or significant property damage or loss and will be, and the phrase and will be used only in the surface of code enforcement.

577
00:46:31,065 --> 00:46:45,587
I'd like to further propose following amendments to adopt amendments, add new subsection to section 50-72, which would be B, body-worn cameras shall be exempt from section 50-72 of this ordinance until January 1st, 2028.

578
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:46,267
Add a new subsection.

579
00:46:50,103 --> 00:46:55,328
Can I just repeat that I missed that but you said it's going to put off the use of body one police cameras.

580
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:57,791
No, it's actually going to exempt our approval.

581
00:46:57,811 --> 00:47:05,798
Those, if those were to be used by the city they would not have to be approved by the city council for five years until January 1 2028.

582
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:28,036
And that would also add to the section 50-73 the same clause, 50-74 the same clause, technical amendment to 50-74 subsection A to change the language to no later than 90 days following the effective date of this ordinance or prior to implementation of any new surveillance technology use covered by this ordinance.

583
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:34,573
strike the first sentence of section 50 77 B and replace it with scope and intentions.

584
00:47:35,013 --> 00:47:49,857
The annual surveillance report is to provide a written report on an annual basis that contains a high level and generalized summary of policies and usages concerning surveillance technology used by any city department during the previous year and containing the information set forth in section 50 dash 77 of this ordinance.

585
00:47:51,397 --> 00:47:58,399
The eighth amendment is to strike and remove section 50 dash 77 C subsections four, five and nine and update the section numbers.

586
00:47:59,638 --> 00:48:04,200
Ninth Amendment is to strike section 50-79B and replace with B cause of action.

587
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:15,025
Any violation of this ordinance constitutes an injury and any person may institute proceedings for injunctive relief, declaratory relief or writ of mandate in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce this ordinance.

588
00:48:15,785 --> 00:48:25,870
Any actions instituted under this paragraph shall be brought against the city and if necessary to effectuate compliance with this ordinance, any other governmental agency with possession, custody or control of data subject to this ordinance.

589
00:48:27,002 --> 00:48:36,707
striking the following sentence from section 59 C and this is due to federal and state Supreme State court rulings that this can't be done by ordinance would be striking the sentence.

590
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:42,950
A court shall award costs and reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiff who is the prevailing party in an action brought to enforce this ordinance.

591
00:48:44,317 --> 00:49:06,063
We'd also strike in a move section 5080 and update the section numbers to reflect that and finally strike section 5081 and replace it with, quote, it shall be unlawful for the city to enter into any contract for monetary value with a commercial entity that provides the city with a mass acquisition of privately generated and own bulk surveillance data, any contracts or agreements signed prior to the enactment of this ordinance that violate this section shall not be renewed.

592
00:49:06,712 --> 00:49:14,346
After the completion of the term of said contracts or agreements, Section 5080 shall not apply to contracts or agreements executed for law enforcement operations or purposes.

593
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:15,968
And those are the amendments.

594
00:49:17,271 --> 00:49:18,352
Can the clerk read those back, please?

595
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:23,520
You're welcome to.

596
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,560
The way I look at this matter.

597
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,841
I think he has it.

598
00:49:25,861 --> 00:49:26,861
Yeah, I thought you asked.

599
00:49:27,702 --> 00:49:28,122
He has it.

600
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,063
No, I would not.

601
00:49:29,763 --> 00:49:34,205
Because right now I think that what we have in front of us is an 11 page ordinance with 12 amendments, right?

602
00:49:34,646 --> 00:49:35,326
This is craziness.

603
00:49:35,526 --> 00:49:35,706
All right.

604
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:39,308
This isn't even something that's really important to the operation of our local government, in my opinion.

605
00:49:39,528 --> 00:49:39,808
Okay.

606
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:46,012
We spent a lot of time, energy and effort working on something when I think we could have really been working on something else that matters to more people in this community.

607
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,553
I understand that there's a group of people that care about this.

608
00:49:48,893 --> 00:49:50,353
I'm not really one of them.

609
00:49:51,174 --> 00:49:55,495
I don't think that this is something that's vital to the future of the city of Medford.

610
00:49:55,835 --> 00:50:03,517
Quite frankly, I think that it does things that can kind of hamstrung our ability to move forward and to promote a vision that adopts technology.

611
00:50:04,018 --> 00:50:08,079
When we sit down, when we first started talking about this ordinance, chat GPT wasn't a thing.

612
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:10,280
And now look what it is, right?

613
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,221
So in a very short period of time, technology has changed.

614
00:50:13,782 --> 00:50:18,484
And quite frankly, when we codify something in an ordinance, the government process is designed to move slow.

615
00:50:19,245 --> 00:50:24,988
And by codifying this in ordinance, I think what it's going to do is hamstring us in our ability to adapt the technology.

616
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:27,929
So it's really not something that I want to support this evening.

617
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:34,933
You know, I think when we're looking at the direction that we're going in here in the community, you know,

618
00:50:36,204 --> 00:50:45,192
We're working on a lot of things, but the results that the people want to see that I talk to are in the streets.

619
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:50,228
They're on the ground, they're on the sidewalks, they're in the delivery of services.

620
00:50:51,388 --> 00:50:54,528
So while I can appreciate the work that's gone into this, it's not gonna be able to support this evening.

621
00:50:55,209 --> 00:51:07,171
And I asked my council colleagues to really think long and hard about an 11 page ordinance with 12 amendments on the floor, and whether or not that's a good transparent public process for us to take hold of and move on.

622
00:51:07,511 --> 00:51:12,732
I understand that the gentleman put a lot of work into it, as well as the lady, my colleague said I did an excellent job on this ordinance, don't get me wrong.

623
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:14,792
It's just something that I have problems with,

624
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:17,649
theoretically.

625
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,311
So for those reasons, I will be supporting the paper this evening.

626
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:25,113
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

627
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:25,894
Thank you, Madam President.

628
00:51:26,014 --> 00:51:28,515
Thank you, Councilor Collins, Councilor Villes.

629
00:51:28,935 --> 00:51:32,817
I know this took a lot of time, but I've been steadfast in my

630
00:51:35,152 --> 00:51:42,854
my view of our business and the lack of legal representation that could guide this council.

631
00:51:43,515 --> 00:51:49,716
And without that, that's one of the many reasons why I can't support this this evening.

632
00:51:49,736 --> 00:52:00,060
Like Councilor Knight said, there are 12 amendments of an ordinance that needs to be changed and how that affects the technology piece, not just this situation, but moving forward in other situations.

633
00:52:02,897 --> 00:52:08,819
Again, I'm gonna say this again, Councilor Knight put it one way, I'll put it the way that I've been saying it.

634
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:18,782
We've been trying to do the city's business without a city attorney that represents this council, that guides us on ordinances.

635
00:52:19,922 --> 00:52:27,245
The recommendations from KP Law, I don't even know if they would be valid for the fact that they don't work for this council.

636
00:52:28,193 --> 00:52:38,586
So any legal information that we need to back from dealing with the legality of this or any of the questions that we had.

637
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:50,105
I really can't trust or depend on, and to support this right now would be no different than any of the other papers that I've not voted for because of the lack of legal guidance.

638
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:52,486
So I hope you can understand that.

639
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:53,687
I appreciate the hard work.

640
00:52:53,727 --> 00:52:57,810
I know that this took a lot of work, and I appreciate that.

641
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:58,310
So thank you.

642
00:52:58,930 --> 00:52:59,711
Thank you, Councilor Capelli.

643
00:53:00,772 --> 00:53:01,312
Councilor Collins.

644
00:53:02,437 --> 00:53:11,439
Thank you, President Morrell, and I appreciate my colleagues thoughtful consideration of what's before us this evening, not just a 12 page ordinance, but also 12 floor amendments to go with it.

645
00:53:11,459 --> 00:53:15,960
And Councilor Scarpelli, to your point, I honestly, I do hear you on the legal council piece.

646
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:27,182
I think that that is a concern that this entire body shares, and I'm sympathetic to your view that, you know, at some point we have to draw the line when it comes to demanding appropriate legal representation for this council.

647
00:53:27,262 --> 00:53:29,142
At the same time, I've made this clear many times

648
00:53:30,577 --> 00:53:32,738
to me, serving in public office is a privilege.

649
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:39,262
None of us know how long we're going to get to sit in this chair and I'm committed to doing what I can while I can for a lot for as long as I sit in this chair.

650
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:45,747
So when I hear about an ordinance that a community group has been pushing for for four years, if I have the opportunity to work on it, I'm going to work on it.

651
00:53:46,187 --> 00:53:48,028
That's my personal opinion and I respect yours.

652
00:53:48,668 --> 00:53:49,649
On the issue of the 12-4 amendments,

653
00:53:52,173 --> 00:54:01,922
You know, I think this is something that is procedurally well within bounds so there are other comments that I've heard that I don't quite know how to countenance but if any of my fellow counselors would like us to go more in depth on what's before us.

654
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:07,267
I know we did kind of a speed read round I'd also be very happy to walk anybody through it.

655
00:54:07,848 --> 00:54:11,492
I touched on this in my opening remarks but all of these floor amendments have come from.

656
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:25,595
conversations that we have had with the city administration over the past months, in the past two weeks, as recently as today, all in service of trying to pass an ordinance that is manageable and doable for this administration.

657
00:54:26,295 --> 00:54:34,123
I'm sorry if that process didn't feel transparent at first blush, but there's, you know, all of this in spirit of this ordinance can be talked through.

658
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:34,863
Thank you.

659
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,123
Point of information if I can.

660
00:54:36,383 --> 00:54:36,924
Councilor Scarbelli.

661
00:54:37,124 --> 00:54:50,687
In no time do I question your ability or I'm disrespecting you in any way, madam, my fellow council, but like I said, and the other votes we've taken, we've talked about this and I've been steadfast on this.

662
00:54:52,107 --> 00:55:03,810
Even with the knowledge of the city administration or the knowledge of outside parties or your intense work, I still, still doing the city's work and making sure

663
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:08,413
that anything I vote on, I feel secure legally that I've done the right thing.

664
00:55:09,013 --> 00:55:11,235
And again, I bring this back all the way back to BJ's.

665
00:55:12,216 --> 00:55:16,539
We voted on something that we thought was right because the work of this council, we thought we put in how we felt.

666
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,061
It came back and we were sued and we lost.

667
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:26,227
And we lost money tenfold, whether it be attorneys fighting the fight or fighting the appeal or whatnot.

668
00:55:26,747 --> 00:55:29,529
And I think that that's my point.

669
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:30,650
Nothing else right now.

670
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,472
I think that this is the reason why

671
00:55:34,148 --> 00:55:40,094
I know that this is the frustration that Councilor Nye brought up when it came to Councilor Beza's last paper.

672
00:55:40,774 --> 00:55:47,721
We talked about the partnership with the mayor's office and this council working together.

673
00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:56,850
In other municipalities, there is a liaison that works directly with the mayor's office that works as a partner with us.

674
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:17,325
When we had some issues and concerns and negativity going back from this office, I sat with the chief of staff, I sat with the mayor, and I said, please, allow us to share in the celebrations, but as equal share in the negative issues that are happening, that we can work together.

675
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:19,085
And that's just not happening.

676
00:56:19,945 --> 00:56:22,346
And until it starts to hurt,

677
00:56:23,863 --> 00:56:26,284
I have not, I haven't voted for a money paper.

678
00:56:26,744 --> 00:56:28,065
I will not vote for money paper.

679
00:56:28,565 --> 00:56:36,890
I think the city administration has to understand either we start getting along, we start fulfilling the needs that we need as a council that we've asked for for years.

680
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,110
I can't support it.

681
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:40,652
It has nothing to do with, I appreciate what you're doing.

682
00:56:40,672 --> 00:56:42,492
I appreciate your knowledge and the time you put into it.

683
00:56:42,813 --> 00:56:46,815
But again, no disrespect, but you're not an attorney.

684
00:56:47,825 --> 00:57:06,218
the people in that office I'm working for this, this, this office, this, this department, and we don't have anybody that's that's guiding us, because I will tell you, I did contact city solicitors that I used to work with, and they, they recommended that George you don't, you shouldn't do anything until you get a representation from your city solicitor because

685
00:57:07,448 --> 00:57:09,250
They don't know, they've never heard this before.

686
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:17,257
There's no definition of who is guiding us in signing any ordinance, let alone this ordinance, but any ordinance moving forward.

687
00:57:17,918 --> 00:57:22,382
And if it's coming from, you know, support and who's guiding us, who's pushing this forward.

688
00:57:23,182 --> 00:57:27,767
So that's why I'm cognizant and a little leery of anything we do.

689
00:57:28,007 --> 00:57:31,030
And I know that I've talked to Councilor Biaz, I've talked to Councilor Morrell about this.

690
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:32,971
I know we have to do the city's work.

691
00:57:33,732 --> 00:57:40,574
But there are some things we just can't, can't push forward without having what I feel comfortable for the constituents that put me here.

692
00:57:40,594 --> 00:57:45,755
So I appreciate it and I apologize, but I thank you for respecting both of our opinions.

693
00:57:45,815 --> 00:57:45,975
So.

694
00:57:48,516 --> 00:57:50,296
Any further discussion from the council at this time?

695
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:52,737
Councilor Carville.

696
00:57:53,317 --> 00:57:54,657
Thank you, Madam President.

697
00:57:55,518 --> 00:57:56,658
These amendments are dated today.

698
00:57:56,678 --> 00:57:58,318
When were these amendments drawn up?

699
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,119
I see a date of today on it.

700
00:58:01,819 --> 00:58:02,119
I'm sorry?

701
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,061
I see the date of today.

702
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:04,941
I have a question.

703
00:58:05,262 --> 00:58:06,182
I'm a member of the committee.

704
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,644
How come I wasn't consulted in any of these?

705
00:58:10,165 --> 00:58:13,268
Well, this was reported out of committee and then reported out of committee of the whole.

706
00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:16,890
These are from, these were reported out, these are the amendments.

707
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,532
No, no, no, these are.

708
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:26,077
No, these are, these are, sorry, Councilor Kerrio, these are new amendments that we're proposing after it was reported out of committee of the whole.

709
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,579
fellow members of this committee and I was a consultant on this.

710
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,302
And these are amendments being presented by vice-president Behrs.

711
00:58:35,442 --> 00:58:54,113
These are amendments that I just proposed them, but that councilor Collins and I, as the people who filed the paper, we met in negotiations with the mayor and the chief to develop a list of further amendments after the paper had been reported out of both the subcommittee and the committee of the whole.

712
00:58:54,393 --> 00:58:58,816
So why wouldn't the subcommittee admit again to discuss these amendments?

713
00:58:58,996 --> 00:59:00,357
Well, the paper had already been reported out.

714
00:59:04,128 --> 00:59:05,369
Any further discussion from the councilor?

715
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:05,969
Councilor Sang?

716
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:21,141
I have some notes written, but I would actually, if my councilors are amenable, I'd like to listen to some residents who are here for this topic.

717
00:59:22,162 --> 00:59:23,643
Any other council discussion at this time?

718
00:59:23,783 --> 00:59:25,204
Madam Mayor, I think we all know where we stand on this.

719
00:59:25,224 --> 00:59:25,985
Why don't we just take a vote?

720
00:59:26,645 --> 00:59:30,528
I mean, I think we, there's a number of residents here to speak, and I think we'd like to hear from them.

721
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,109
So I'm happy to.

722
00:59:33,065 --> 00:59:33,766
have folks come up.

723
00:59:33,906 --> 00:59:34,866
The chief is here as well.

724
00:59:34,926 --> 00:59:41,812
And also, yeah, Chief Buckley, if you'd like to speak first, or... I mean, you are more than welcome to speak first.

725
00:59:42,272 --> 00:59:43,853
Then we'll hear from the members of the public.

726
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:53,060
There you go.

727
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:55,962
I always do.

728
00:59:56,922 --> 00:59:57,762
Happy Valentine's Day.

729
00:59:57,782 --> 01:00:00,044
Thanks for letting me come before you to speak for this.

730
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:04,646
I myself have been involved in these negotiations for four years now.

731
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:06,106
I think we started 2019 and

732
01:00:09,646 --> 01:00:16,651
recognized from very early on that this is a difficult ordinance for not just the city but for the police department.

733
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:18,612
A lot of this pertains to the police department.

734
01:00:19,652 --> 01:00:33,321
As the negotiations have developed throughout the years and more specifically this past year, the ordinance took on some heft and involved a lot of items that very clearly I could not produce for this city.

735
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:34,582
And

736
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:43,054
I can, by way of example, I can tell you that I'm a strong proponent of police officers wearing body-worn cameras.

737
01:00:43,554 --> 01:00:44,895
My unions are in support of it.

738
01:00:44,935 --> 01:00:46,276
The police department is in support of it.

739
01:00:46,616 --> 01:00:49,078
It is a piece of technology that I have

740
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:53,745
very early on identified as wanting to be exempt from this policy.

741
01:00:53,945 --> 01:01:10,412
And as the sort of debate around this CCOPS ordinance developed, it became clear that it would be impossible for me to implement a body-worn camera policy if the ordinance was to be voted in the way it was written.

742
01:01:11,072 --> 01:01:14,394
Very recently, and again, I understand where I stand

743
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:18,480
Vote wise and politically wise where this is.

744
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:35,851
I am negotiating from the position of weakness You know The the C cops C cops ordinance in itself The irony of the name and so I know we can go back and forth to call it, you know community control the public surveillance Police surveillance.

745
01:01:35,891 --> 01:01:37,492
That's what everybody is put the floor.

746
01:01:37,532 --> 01:01:41,815
It's why it being an acronym is C cops Is

747
01:01:43,777 --> 01:01:58,202
It's just it's a way of looking at police in a negative light and I believe in my profession and I believe in our police department and I believe in the officers that go out there and I believe that they do a very difficult job and they do it very well and that

748
01:01:58,642 --> 01:02:02,924
Legislating how they should behave is probably not necessarily the right thing to do.

749
01:02:02,944 --> 01:02:07,666
We should be supporting them, training them, holding them accountable, and all for that.

750
01:02:08,566 --> 01:02:20,471
So as we move forward with this, in the last few days, there's been conversations about modifying the ordinance to address some of the concerns that I have had.

751
01:02:21,191 --> 01:02:26,534
Because I'm telling you, last week, if the ordinance passed, I would not have a body-worn camera policy.

752
01:02:26,554 --> 01:02:27,314
And I've got to tell you.

753
01:02:29,932 --> 01:02:33,933
God forbid anything had happened, it would be on this council that body-worn cameras were not on the street.

754
01:02:34,473 --> 01:02:41,635
There's been some amendments that have been put forward that, you know, considering my negotiation position, I have to support, right?

755
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:48,636
I've talked to both councils, and I've said from the beginning, I want body-worn cameras exempt for a lot of reasons.

756
01:02:49,656 --> 01:02:56,238
There is a five-year exemption, which will allow me to put body-worn cameras on the street, and it'll probably be as soon as this summer, at least in some sort

757
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:57,420
training program.

758
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:05,606
So the way the amendments are, I support having amendments to an ordinance that I probably don't totally support.

759
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:10,149
I mean, I always find myself having to qualify and quantify things I say.

760
01:03:10,469 --> 01:03:13,471
I support the civil liberties and civil rights of all people.

761
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:18,635
I mean, I took an oath, and I've honored that oath for 25 years.

762
01:03:18,955 --> 01:03:20,536
So it's not that aspect of the ordinance.

763
01:03:21,037 --> 01:03:22,758
It's the burden that it's putting on the police department.

764
01:03:23,142 --> 01:03:23,902
I'm not Boston.

765
01:03:24,022 --> 01:03:24,743
I'm not Cambridge.

766
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:25,543
I'm not Somerville.

767
01:03:25,683 --> 01:03:30,886
I'm not San Francisco and any of the other major city and municipalities that have this ordinance.

768
01:03:31,346 --> 01:03:32,847
I'm down with 20 police officers.

769
01:03:33,387 --> 01:03:36,168
Even watered down, this puts a burden on my police department.

770
01:03:36,749 --> 01:03:48,754
So I very much appreciate that the amendments are in there and that there was some listening and going back and forth to allow at least me to be able to put a body-worn camera policy in place.

771
01:03:51,457 --> 01:03:55,618
sound practice for a manager like myself to sit there and push it down the road for five years?

772
01:03:56,419 --> 01:03:58,179
I don't think so, but I have to take it, right?

773
01:03:58,479 --> 01:04:01,941
I mean, I have to sort of say, I have to take the five years.

774
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:04,722
I want 41 cameras excluded permanently.

775
01:04:04,782 --> 01:04:05,782
We've had that discussion.

776
01:04:05,802 --> 01:04:07,743
I don't think I'm gonna get my way.

777
01:04:11,004 --> 01:04:13,005
I don't know if I'm gonna be here in five years to address it.

778
01:04:13,025 --> 01:04:14,385
I don't know if I'm gonna be here next week.

779
01:04:14,465 --> 01:04:20,087
I mean, that's the way policing goes these days, but it is not sound practice to put

780
01:04:21,438 --> 01:04:27,183
managerial practice to put in play body-worn camera policy or any other policy, and then say five years from now, we'll look at it and review it.

781
01:04:28,224 --> 01:04:29,184
Thumbs up or thumbs down.

782
01:04:29,805 --> 01:04:34,068
I think we should learn a lot of lessons when we put it in the street and keep it in play.

783
01:04:35,289 --> 01:04:38,372
So I try not to confuse people.

784
01:04:38,652 --> 01:04:42,175
I mean, as far as the ordinance goes, I believe in this police department, I do.

785
01:04:42,415 --> 01:04:46,959
And I don't believe that, you know, we need an ordinance to make us do good police work.

786
01:04:48,611 --> 01:04:53,655
I will repeat over and over again that we always uphold civil rights and civil liberties in this police department.

787
01:04:53,695 --> 01:05:00,100
We will maintain it when those issues are called into question, we will investigate and we will hold officers accountable when needed be.

788
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:09,968
That being said, recognizing that this ordinance is going to pass, the amendments do help me get a body-worn camera program in play.

789
01:05:10,649 --> 01:05:11,049
And so I

790
01:05:15,622 --> 01:05:17,824
I just it's just a position of weakness that I stand for.

791
01:05:17,884 --> 01:05:22,349
So I would prefer to have body one cameras excluded completely.

792
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:26,132
I know it's probably not proper to be up here negotiating that.

793
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:31,277
But the things that were put in place in the past for this ordinance have sort of

794
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:41,177
you know, would have put this police department in a very tragic position as it relates to managing a police department and holding them accountable in 2023 and further.

795
01:05:42,018 --> 01:05:43,259
Now there's a little bit of light.

796
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:44,500
I would like it to go further.

797
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:48,644
If you have questions, I'll be able to answer them, but that's where I stand on this, people.

798
01:05:49,284 --> 01:05:50,045
Thank you, Chief.

799
01:05:50,085 --> 01:05:50,725
Just one question.

800
01:05:51,326 --> 01:06:00,934
Chief, since your tenure as a chief, have you seen, is there identified issues with what we're talking about that people's civil liberties have been

801
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,671
harness harmed.

802
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:07,936
So through the use of technology, I don't know of any right now.

803
01:06:07,976 --> 01:06:10,499
And that's what we're talking about technology and surveillance.

804
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:12,842
I've said from the beginning, I don't have much of this.

805
01:06:13,062 --> 01:06:15,104
We're not a very wealthy community.

806
01:06:15,264 --> 01:06:19,950
And if I have money, I'm going to spend it on human resources, not on surveillance technology.

807
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:21,772
We don't have a lot of this technology.

808
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:22,873
And those that

809
01:06:23,307 --> 01:06:38,458
You know, we do have, have historically been exempt from, Boston's exempted some of the, like the 911, it is a surveillance piece of equipment, but we haven't received in my tenure, but I can tell you 25 years prior to that, many complaints that I can think of off the top of my head as it relates to that.

810
01:06:38,738 --> 01:06:49,446
So two Sundays ago, I was personally involved in a road rage incident where a person, I had my son and another guest in my car,

811
01:06:51,565 --> 01:07:02,550
up and down 93, young person driving crazy, slowing down near an exit, threw a bottle off my car, contacted the state police.

812
01:07:04,551 --> 01:07:08,713
As we're traversing, they were taking off the exit.

813
01:07:10,074 --> 01:07:12,055
Person was making motion that he was gonna shoot me.

814
01:07:13,676 --> 01:07:18,518
As we came closer, and we were really slow because they were slowing up going to the exit.

815
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:27,739
That person then slouched down into a seat, and I heard my son scream, dad, he's got a gun.

816
01:07:27,779 --> 01:07:28,880
We talked to the state troopers.

817
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,481
They ran the numbers.

818
01:07:30,561 --> 01:07:34,503
Unfortunately, it wasn't the plate, the number with the car that we set.

819
01:07:36,284 --> 01:07:38,545
Got a phone call yesterday from the state police, thankfully.

820
01:07:39,686 --> 01:07:48,931
What I expressed that evening was not even that the gun issue, but the fear for my family that if he has my license plate,

821
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:54,274
What is he gonna do if he's gonna brandish a gun on the highway?

822
01:07:56,194 --> 01:08:09,959
State Trooper called me yesterday, told me thankfully for the surveillance cameras on the Cloverleaf, they identified the car to the plate that we gave, and they followed through.

823
01:08:09,979 --> 01:08:17,602
He couldn't give us any more information, but to say that, it's safe to say that

824
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:29,167
It's documented, they know it, but there's a history there with that situation.

825
01:08:29,227 --> 01:08:37,853
So I can tell you firsthand, I know my son and his friend haven't slept because of that fear.

826
01:08:41,165 --> 01:08:42,185
I just want to share that with you.

827
01:08:42,445 --> 01:08:51,407
So I appreciate how state troopers do their due diligence using that form of policing in a sense that, and it really wasn't used for policing.

828
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:52,908
It's really used for traffic.

829
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:58,909
And when you talk about a gun, they really triggered something for them to look at that.

830
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:01,409
And there was history there.

831
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,610
So I just wanted to share that with you.

832
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:04,150
So thank you.

833
01:09:05,013 --> 01:09:05,353
Thank you.

834
01:09:05,633 --> 01:09:09,514
And of course, you know, like technology is meant to be used for good.

835
01:09:09,614 --> 01:09:15,956
And I get it, there are people who can fear for this, but you have to have some faith in your employees and some faith in the people you asked to lead them, right?

836
01:09:16,036 --> 01:09:23,239
And I was asked to lead this police department and I believe in controlling how we operate as a police department and for the good.

837
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:34,482
And, you know, even with the amendments, it's a burden on the police department, but I have to say, it's a very, very difficult position to stand here to say,

838
01:09:36,037 --> 01:09:40,665
not for the ordinance, but I really need these, like, if you want a body-worn camera, I need this amendments passed.

839
01:09:40,905 --> 01:09:42,267
So it's kind of.

840
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:52,302
know, uh, difficult, but I would ask that if somebody would reconsider at the last second to exempt 41 cameras forever because I think it's a good technology.

841
01:09:52,342 --> 01:10:06,686
I think it's going to hold, uh, the city in a better light, and we will never have to answer the questions that they've had to answer in Cambridge and other communities that have not, you know, have impeded the progress of 41 cameras on police.

842
01:10:06,926 --> 01:10:08,327
So other questions.

843
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:09,547
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

844
01:10:11,288 --> 01:10:11,948
Thank you, President Merrill.

845
01:10:12,827 --> 01:10:14,488
Thank you chief appreciate you being up here.

846
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:25,314
You know, like I said earlier today, I really appreciate your candor, I know that this is a difficult conversation I really appreciate that you've been willing to have it with us with me for a year with others for four years.

847
01:10:25,994 --> 01:10:32,498
You know, I respect where you're coming from and I just want to reiterate that I don't want to repeat our conversation from earlier from two weeks ago, etc.

848
01:10:34,005 --> 01:10:39,369
you know, to the extent that we're having this conversation in the public forum, just for the sake of responding to you and putting it on the record.

849
01:10:40,049 --> 01:10:47,515
You know, I do want to emphasize that, you know, again, our intent here is not to be anti-surveillance technology.

850
01:10:47,915 --> 01:10:51,698
You know, that there is a reason that the ordinance is called Community Control over Public Surveillance.

851
01:10:51,718 --> 01:10:59,443
I think it's evidenced by our December Committee of the Whole when we had a whole range of city departments petitioning for exemptions or asking questions.

852
01:10:59,483 --> 01:11:00,304
How will this affect me?

853
01:11:00,384 --> 01:11:01,244
How will this affect me?

854
01:11:01,865 --> 01:11:03,186
It's really not our intent to

855
01:11:03,897 --> 01:11:09,639
target your very reliable department specifically, and I hope that you know that that intent is sincere.

856
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:12,979
We've done our best to enshrine that in the language of the ordinance.

857
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:20,501
This is intended to be proactive, not reactive to anything that your department or any other has done or done wrong.

858
01:11:21,201 --> 01:11:22,982
You know, I think I try to say often

859
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:25,810
you know, policy and ordinances.

860
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:29,311
They're not about just today and they're not about tomorrow and not about next week.

861
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:31,712
They're about decades and even generations.

862
01:11:31,752 --> 01:11:37,514
You know, they're about putting something in place that will benefit the community when nobody who's currently in this room is still in this room.

863
01:11:38,254 --> 01:11:47,458
And I think we've tried our best to create a policy that will be right for the community, even when, you know, there's the next Jack Buckley leading the police department.

864
01:11:47,478 --> 01:11:52,700
And even when the city council looks entirely different so that we still have those structures for community input

865
01:11:53,335 --> 01:11:56,477
for transparency, regardless of who is at the helm.

866
01:11:58,098 --> 01:12:08,323
You know, over the past year, we've heard your very reasonable concerns about making sure that this is something that you can actually do, because we all know you have so much on your plate, and we've tried to only pare down this ordinance.

867
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:21,050
I just want to say all that for context, for folks watching at home, for others who are participants in this process, and to say, you know, I really do appreciate your good faith discussions with us throughout this entire process.

868
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:22,931
It's really appreciated, and I hope that you do feel

869
01:12:23,608 --> 01:12:23,828
heard.

870
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:24,529
Thank you.

871
01:12:24,669 --> 01:12:24,969
Thank you.

872
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:26,810
Thank you, Councilor Carbiel.

873
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:28,632
Thank you, Madam Chair.

874
01:12:28,652 --> 01:12:37,198
Chief, if you could, um, maybe elaborate what happened in Cambridge and what the situation is over there in relationship to the rules that we had being proposed there.

875
01:12:38,619 --> 01:12:51,268
Uh, so in relation to the rules being proposed, unfortunately, uh, people's rules different than ours, and they're having a controversy with what happened over there a few weeks ago.

876
01:12:51,672 --> 01:12:55,274
Well, the point that one of those Cambridge does have a similar C cops, so that's right.

877
01:12:55,314 --> 01:12:57,355
Cambridge doesn't have his body on campus, right?

878
01:12:57,375 --> 01:13:02,858
So a lot of the language in here will never impact 41 cameras because they just don't have.

879
01:13:02,998 --> 01:13:04,839
We're trying to implement a program.

880
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:11,643
My reference earlier was to the, you know, to the tragic events that happened.

881
01:13:11,663 --> 01:13:15,225
The police involved shooting and, you know, there was a public outcry

882
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:22,375
justified to some degree, that they want body-worn camera footage to see what happened.

883
01:13:23,257 --> 01:13:27,144
Cameras don't tell you everything, but they can give you some

884
01:13:27,898 --> 01:13:30,119
some basis of to what the facts were.

885
01:13:30,519 --> 01:13:42,202
And Cambridge has the police department and I know many of the offices and they've historically asked for 41 cameras and they've been denied for various reasons and some of it political.

886
01:13:42,262 --> 01:13:45,823
And I don't want this to prevent us from getting 41 cameras in the street.

887
01:13:46,043 --> 01:13:47,264
That was what the reference was for.

888
01:13:47,864 --> 01:13:49,104
So will they have a similar ordinance?

889
01:13:49,904 --> 01:13:52,125
Doesn't matter if they exclude 41 cameras because they don't have them.

890
01:13:53,027 --> 01:13:57,651
and there was never an intent, in my understanding, to bring body-worn cameras.

891
01:13:57,972 --> 01:13:59,933
That whole argument has probably changed right now.

892
01:14:00,093 --> 01:14:05,058
I'm willing to bet you that body-worn cameras are coming to the city of Cambridge, and they will have to re-argue.

893
01:14:05,538 --> 01:14:16,188
Now, even the city of Cambridge, for example, puts body-worn cameras and doesn't exempt them from the CCOPS ordinance, they have tremendous resources in Cambridge to be able to administer a program like this.

894
01:14:17,042 --> 01:14:18,203
We just are not in Cambridge.

895
01:14:18,223 --> 01:14:19,264
We don't have those resources.

896
01:14:19,324 --> 01:14:20,144
We're not Boston.

897
01:14:20,204 --> 01:14:21,385
We don't have those resources.

898
01:14:21,746 --> 01:14:22,526
Boston does have.

899
01:14:23,147 --> 01:14:25,048
Somerville excludes body-worn cameras, right?

900
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:25,889
But they don't have them.

901
01:14:26,049 --> 01:14:27,870
They cut them out of their last budget, right?

902
01:14:27,911 --> 01:14:29,992
So Somerville Police wanted body-worn cameras.

903
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:32,134
They budgeted $400-something thousand for them.

904
01:14:32,194 --> 01:14:36,217
And then their city council removed them from the budget to support the program.

905
01:14:36,497 --> 01:14:37,018
So we come from a

906
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:39,474
There's a lot of similarities, right?

907
01:14:39,614 --> 01:14:45,456
We are one of those communities that's about to pass a CCOPS ordinance, but we're really not similar in community size, right?

908
01:14:45,496 --> 01:14:50,518
We're a police department that has 41 cameras and trying to put them on the street, but we have less resources.

909
01:14:50,578 --> 01:14:53,840
And that's why this impacts us differently than some of these other communities.

910
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,701
When it comes down to it.

911
01:14:56,721 --> 01:14:56,881
Thanks.

912
01:14:58,102 --> 01:14:59,722
Any further discussion from the council at this time?

913
01:14:59,782 --> 01:15:00,463
Vice President Paris.

914
01:15:00,883 --> 01:15:01,503
Thank you, Madam President.

915
01:15:01,523 --> 01:15:02,924
I'll keep it short and just say that

916
01:15:04,137 --> 01:15:10,981
appreciate you coming forward, Chief, tonight and your engagement in the discussions and negotiations prior to tonight.

917
01:15:12,062 --> 01:15:31,875
Something that I've seen out of the conversations that I've been able to be a part of is that I personally, and I hope we can agree on at least this part, I do think that we share the same goals of having the trust and the process and the public understanding of what we're doing.

918
01:15:32,558 --> 01:15:42,121
I think where we've differed is on the approach and the details of that process, you know, and from as one person involved.

919
01:15:42,781 --> 01:15:49,804
I think we've tried to find a middle ground between the two positions about which that process should look like and my hopes are that that will

920
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:53,902
mean that we can move forward to achieve the goals that we do share around it.

921
01:15:54,342 --> 01:16:05,913
And, you know, again, something that I said earlier and I'll reiterate is it's a foundation, something to look at in the long term, but also something that we can look at as practice happens and make adjustments.

922
01:16:06,293 --> 01:16:09,436
And, you know, I think that that openness to do that is the key.

923
01:16:10,397 --> 01:16:20,399
in any sense to being successful as things change and as things are so rapidly changing as a surveillance technology or the practices of implementing those technologies.

924
01:16:20,419 --> 01:16:23,040
So I just wanted to say that and end there.

925
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,340
I'm going to support this tonight.

926
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,841
Obviously, I'm going to support it with the amendments.

927
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:34,722
And I think as we go from that point, we'll be able to have a public process around the surveillance technology that we hadn't had before.

928
01:16:35,142 --> 01:16:35,482
Thank you.

929
01:16:36,283 --> 01:16:38,443
If I should embarrass any other Councillors to speak,

930
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:42,551
Okay, so we haven't, anything else you'd like to add, Chief?

931
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:43,531
Oh, no, no, thank you.

932
01:16:43,611 --> 01:16:44,291
Okay, I think we'll go.

933
01:16:44,331 --> 01:16:45,252
I appreciate the opportunity.

934
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:45,872
Thank you so much.

935
01:16:45,992 --> 01:16:50,373
We have a number of members of the public who'd like to speak, if you could just come up to the podium.

936
01:17:02,316 --> 01:17:05,218
Name and address for the record, please, and slowly for the clerk.

937
01:17:05,578 --> 01:17:06,359
Sure, sure.

938
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:07,380
Good evening, everyone.

939
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,560
My name is Julie Flynn.

940
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,782
I live at 32 Summer Road, Medford, Mass.

941
01:17:12,944 --> 01:17:18,107
So I am a Medford resident and a member of Ward 8 and a member of Medford People Power.

942
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:21,169
And we are the group that was the proponent of this ordinance.

943
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:25,272
And for those of you who don't know us, Medford People Power is a local group.

944
01:17:25,352 --> 01:17:27,034
It's been around for six years.

945
01:17:27,454 --> 01:17:31,657
We are concerned about civil rights and civil liberties here in this city.

946
01:17:32,438 --> 01:17:38,901
And approximately four years ago, we really saw the value of this ordinance here in Medford.

947
01:17:39,722 --> 01:17:48,886
And I think Councilor Collins and Zach Beers tonight has sort of captured and said things about this ordinance that we thought about four years ago.

948
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:52,088
And that is, look, this is a 21st century issue.

949
01:17:52,448 --> 01:17:55,670
It is happening in cities and towns across the United States.

950
01:17:56,150 --> 01:18:04,957
And that is, as it's been explained already tonight, we have these powerful surveillance technologies that exist and are ever expanding on one hand.

951
01:18:05,377 --> 01:18:11,722
And then on the other hand, we have this potential use to acquire it and using it within our own city.

952
01:18:12,162 --> 01:18:15,985
So the ability of our own city to surveil us as residents.

953
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:22,470
And all this ordinance sort of at a fundamental level, common sense level is saying, all right,

954
01:18:24,098 --> 01:18:27,740
All right, this technology exists, the city might want it, what should we do?

955
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:31,541
And all this sort of asks for is some public input.

956
01:18:32,061 --> 01:18:36,263
So if in fact someone wants to acquire it, it should go before the city council.

957
01:18:36,363 --> 01:18:40,965
You as city council members should know that this is happening within our city.

958
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:46,507
We as residents should know about the use of something like that in our city.

959
01:18:47,215 --> 01:18:59,038
And so anyway, so I think it is sort of just this basic ability to have democratic input in something as powerful as your own city and surveilling the residents within the city.

960
01:19:00,198 --> 01:19:05,299
And I should say, and it's already been said, this ordinance doesn't ban any technologies.

961
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:08,740
It has no statement about any surveillance technology at all.

962
01:19:10,681 --> 01:19:13,921
And so there's no ban on anything.

963
01:19:14,161 --> 01:19:16,682
And it makes no comment about any specific technology.

964
01:19:17,187 --> 01:19:29,294
And as Council Collins has pointed out, there's gonna be so many ordinances, I mean, there's gonna be so many kinds of technologies in the near future, 20 years from now, three years from now, two years from now, it doesn't matter, there's gonna be a lot.

965
01:19:29,674 --> 01:19:46,764
And this ordinance is not about the state of any department here today, it's about building an ordinance that is good for now, two years from now, three years from now, dealing with an issue that does exist, which is surveilling

966
01:19:47,258 --> 01:19:49,539
surveillance of us as residents.

967
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,042
Anyway, it has been four years since we started.

968
01:19:53,282 --> 01:19:58,045
And I just want to say it's been a journey with lots of discussions and lots of endorsements.

969
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:04,589
I mean, there's just been a tremendous amount of work with people power working with the mayor's office speaking with the chief.

970
01:20:05,049 --> 01:20:09,912
Everyone has talked about it's been three years of different conversations going on.

971
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:13,855
We've had a webinar, inviting citizens and political groups to it.

972
01:20:14,355 --> 01:20:16,857
We've gained the endorsements of many along the way.

973
01:20:17,949 --> 01:20:22,510
And some of the members of the groups who have endorsed it will be here tonight to speak.

974
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:40,235
We've gained the endorsements of the NAACP for the principles of this ordinance, the Human Rights Commission, Sanctuary Church, Unitarian Universal Church, Democratic City Committee, Democratic Boards 82, Safe Medford, the Welcome Project, and the West Medford Community Center.

975
01:20:40,476 --> 01:20:45,537
So there has been a lot of community endorsement for the principles behind this ordinance

976
01:20:46,157 --> 01:21:01,466
And I think someone will speak tonight and to give some flavor to the, you know, sort of the texture and the historical reasons why such an ordinance like this has an impact more than maybe, just has an impact for many different groups of people here within Medford.

977
01:21:01,786 --> 01:21:09,030
So I wanna just thank you for the time tonight and we wish for your support.

978
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:09,451
Thank you.

979
01:21:09,871 --> 01:21:10,131
Thank you.

980
01:21:14,192 --> 01:21:15,413
Name and address for the record, please.

981
01:21:15,433 --> 01:21:18,975
Good evening, David Harris, 151 Sharon Street, West Medford.

982
01:21:19,555 --> 01:21:22,616
I'm a resident of that address for 28 years.

983
01:21:23,397 --> 01:21:27,439
I've served as a chair of the Human Rights Commission for 10 years.

984
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,641
These glasses are terrible, all right.

985
01:21:31,661 --> 01:21:37,224
And most recently retired as a managing director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School.

986
01:21:38,205 --> 01:21:41,286
I'm also the chair of the Massachusetts Advisory Committee to the U.S.

987
01:21:41,306 --> 01:21:42,327
Commission on Civil Rights.

988
01:21:43,639 --> 01:21:58,026
Being a career of 50 years dedicated to race and justice, I've come to understand racism as a differential distribution of access, opportunity, health, well-being, membership, and participation in society, a structure that cuts across all of our institutions.

989
01:21:58,807 --> 01:22:11,353
This differential distribution often occurs unknowingly as a by-product of policies and practices that are inserted into existing structures uncritically without regard for how they might enhance or dismantle inequality.

990
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:16,917
As a resident of Medford, I'm committed to having our city act responsibly in this regard.

991
01:22:18,057 --> 01:22:31,448
From my perspective, we face a crisis across the country today with serious decline in confidence in our institutions across all realms, public, private, academic, and nowhere is this crisis greater than in the area of policing.

992
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:36,552
Because police are granted legitimate use of force, this crisis is more pressing.

993
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:47,868
While I know this ordinance covers all departments, I'm going to focus on implications of the practice of policing, the practice, not individual officers or officials.

994
01:22:48,864 --> 01:23:00,067
My work at the Houston Institute focused on what we call community justice, derived from the belief that community members can and must play a role in public policymaking and evaluation of those policies.

995
01:23:00,367 --> 01:23:04,768
We hear a lot about community policing these days, which I guess is a good thing.

996
01:23:05,448 --> 01:23:08,349
The problem is how to translate that phrase into practice.

997
01:23:09,309 --> 01:23:12,710
It has to be more than basketball games and cookouts, more than officer friendly.

998
01:23:13,495 --> 01:23:24,401
Community policing must include bringing the community into the policymaking process, as well as creating mechanisms for regular input from community members about performance.

999
01:23:25,181 --> 01:23:35,887
Policing, indeed our entire democracy, proceeds from an implicit contract with the public, a contract whose terms may and do change over time, but whose core underpinning is trust.

1000
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:42,070
In today's world, that trust has been damaged and many people often feel at odds, if not under siege.

1001
01:23:43,421 --> 01:23:51,809
It may well be that Medford is not at an extreme crisis point, but we cannot escape the need to revisit and renew the contract.

1002
01:23:53,351 --> 01:24:02,680
We know our public officials have shown a willingness to acknowledge the enduring legacy of past racial injustice for which all residents are thankful for that acknowledgement.

1003
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:07,244
While awareness and acknowledgement are important steps, they're only that.

1004
01:24:08,193 --> 01:24:13,661
Well, excuse me, we must act with intentionality in the present and anticipation of the future.

1005
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:19,930
And that future is sure to bring an increase in the use of surveillance technology.

1006
01:24:20,788 --> 01:24:38,076
Although I'm persuaded that this ordinance will not place undue burdens on those agencies it affects, any such cost may well be the price we pay for days gone by when we cut corners on the rights of some of our neighbors, whether people of color, women, newcomers, differentially abled, or others.

1007
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:44,479
I have two specific concerns about the use of technology in law enforcement and public policymaking.

1008
01:24:44,519 --> 01:24:47,080
The first is a matter of the technology itself.

1009
01:24:49,225 --> 01:24:55,629
Today's technology is astounding in its ability to analyze data, and we can only imagine it will become more powerful in the future.

1010
01:24:56,750 --> 01:25:05,155
But we know this technology is flawed, that it reproduces many of the biases and resulting inaccuracies that racial antipathy wrought in the past.

1011
01:25:06,616 --> 01:25:11,759
In doing so, even in its neutral or impartial application, it carries great risk of harm.

1012
01:25:13,348 --> 01:25:15,868
That alone is reason to exercise extreme caution.

1013
01:25:16,489 --> 01:25:19,949
Powerful as it may be, technology is far from perfect.

1014
01:25:20,809 --> 01:25:27,111
Second, the technology will be used by human beings and we are all flawed and subject to error.

1015
01:25:28,011 --> 01:25:38,973
We can think about various forms of training to protect us from missteps, but reflect on how long we've had implicit bias training and yet it continues to arise in both clinical and everyday settings.

1016
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:53,678
As we contemplate the use of more and more technology in governing, there's an increased rather than decreased need for formal mechanisms of transparency and accountability to residents and elected officials such as yourselves.

1017
01:25:54,818 --> 01:26:06,783
Creating this ordinance will be a way to affirm the contract between government and the governed, which in turn could boost the legitimacy of government, including but not limited to policing in our city.

1018
01:26:08,928 --> 01:26:24,156
I wanna close by thanking you all for your diligence on this matter, for your leadership, and the opportunity for us to take a step toward keeping Medford in the forefront of liberty in this country.

1019
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:25,436
Thank you.

1020
01:26:31,939 --> 01:26:34,821
Going to Munir Germanis on Zoom.

1021
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:38,551
should, there you go.

1022
01:26:38,591 --> 01:26:39,652
Name and address for the record, please.

1023
01:26:42,113 --> 01:26:49,197
My name is Munir Germanus, and I live at 3 Summit Road in Medford.

1024
01:26:50,298 --> 01:26:58,743
I'm speaking tonight on behalf of the Medford Human Rights Commission, where I have served for over five years, three of which as chair.

1025
01:26:59,728 --> 01:27:28,855
As I mentioned in my letter to all members of the city council on October 14th of 2020, and again on October 12th of last year, the commission voted to endorse and reaffirm the principles and goals of community control of public surveillance, and to urge all members of the city council to support the current CCOPS ordinance that is under consideration by the council.

1026
01:27:29,965 --> 01:27:43,312
We realize that such an ordinance will involve some difficult discussions and negotiations that involve the city administration, the police and other departments who would be affected by the ordinance.

1027
01:27:44,153 --> 01:27:56,280
Over the past four years, this process has involved an amazing open discussion between the various parties involved as each party seeks to protect their own interest.

1028
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:11,933
However, we have full confidence in each and every member of the City Council that they will protect the interests of the City, the various departments involved, and all its residents in these discussions.

1029
01:28:12,729 --> 01:28:19,112
We are proud that our city council is involved in this process as our representatives in city government.

1030
01:28:19,812 --> 01:28:27,035
Passing such an ordinance will demonstrate that our voice is being heard in this critical issue.

1031
01:28:27,981 --> 01:28:41,453
The failure to agree on passing such an ordinance will send a message that the community will be excluded from any discussions and decision making of critical matters that affect this community.

1032
01:28:42,093 --> 01:28:50,801
So once again, I respectfully urge each and every member of this council to vote in favor of this ordinance.

1033
01:28:51,441 --> 01:28:54,224
Thank you for your attention and for your consideration.

1034
01:28:55,245 --> 01:28:55,705
Thank you.

1035
01:28:57,212 --> 01:29:00,053
Anyone else who would like to speak either in person or on Zoom?

1036
01:29:06,794 --> 01:29:07,794
Name and address for the record, please.

1037
01:29:10,635 --> 01:29:11,095
Oh, actually.

1038
01:29:12,235 --> 01:29:13,795
I live at 36 Hillside Avenue.

1039
01:29:13,835 --> 01:29:15,036
Sorry, could you hold the beat?

1040
01:29:15,056 --> 01:29:18,836
I realize you're not the clerk, so just, or he can go back to the minutes.

1041
01:29:19,557 --> 01:29:20,837
He can, okay, well, he can watch the video.

1042
01:29:25,328 --> 01:29:40,504
I am a member of Safe Medford, which is a nonpartisan group of Medford residents that advocates for policies, services and education to ensure the safety and dignity of all who live, work, worship and do business in Medford.

1043
01:29:42,733 --> 01:29:55,601
Safe Medford joined People Power in an effort to create a new official policy guidelines for police interaction with all community members, regardless of immigration status.

1044
01:29:56,461 --> 01:30:03,686
We worked with both the past and the current chief of police to eventually codify those procedures.

1045
01:30:05,146 --> 01:30:10,930
We are again joining Medford People Power in support of the CCOPS ordinance under your consideration.

1046
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:19,613
Three years ago, I listened to Chief Buckley's remarks at the city's Martin Luther King holiday event.

1047
01:30:20,954 --> 01:30:28,997
In one of his first public appearances, Chief Buckley made a commitment to the people of Medford to bring

1048
01:30:30,667 --> 01:30:48,972
Medford policing into the 21st century, he pointedly stressed that that meant first acknowledging the historical legacy of harm that police forces committed, particularly and disproportionately to people of color.

1049
01:30:50,313 --> 01:30:51,353
In his remarks,

1050
01:30:52,488 --> 01:31:05,011
Chief Buckley also vowed to work to create trust between Medford's law enforcement and all of Medford's residents, and most especially with its marginalized communities.

1051
01:31:06,751 --> 01:31:14,893
Seacops is one of the places where the rubber meets the road, where the chief's commitment to a 21st century police force is now being tested.

1052
01:31:16,777 --> 01:31:28,383
allowing government to conduct surveillance activities without adequate public oversight keeps the door open to misuse and leads to more mistrust.

1053
01:31:29,844 --> 01:31:33,786
Transparency is essential to building trust.

1054
01:31:35,066 --> 01:31:37,287
It's a key to accountability.

1055
01:31:38,748 --> 01:31:40,849
CCOPS moves us in the right direction.

1056
01:31:41,469 --> 01:31:43,410
I urge you to support this ordinance.

1057
01:31:43,690 --> 01:31:43,991
Thank you.

1058
01:31:50,742 --> 01:31:53,183
Reverend Wendy Miller Olopade on Zoom.

1059
01:31:53,403 --> 01:31:54,083
I'll unmute you.

1060
01:31:58,684 --> 01:31:59,204
Do it again.

1061
01:31:59,224 --> 01:32:04,686
I'll try one more time.

1062
01:32:06,766 --> 01:32:08,367
You should see, there we go.

1063
01:32:08,607 --> 01:32:09,427
Oh, okay, there we go.

1064
01:32:09,587 --> 01:32:12,128
I'm sorry, I didn't realize I had to do it myself as well.

1065
01:32:14,434 --> 01:32:22,962
I am a resident of Medford live at 105 Brooks Street, and as of this week I will have been a resident here for 10 years.

1066
01:32:24,323 --> 01:32:33,292
Thank you so much for giving me a chance to speak and thank you to all of our counselors for continuing to work on this ordinance.

1067
01:32:34,188 --> 01:32:40,573
The last time I participated in some public comments about this ordinance, I spoke about the values of community and accountability.

1068
01:32:41,093 --> 01:32:46,677
Tonight, I want to speak to the values of equity, justice, and the issue of civil rights.

1069
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:57,660
I expect the servants that I elect to protect my privacy and my civil rights and the privacy and the civil rights of all of my neighbors, all of my neighbors.

1070
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:10,512
I also expect that the civil servants that my taxes employ and the officials that my votes elect are attending to the safety and the well-being of all of Medford's residents equitably.

1071
01:33:11,473 --> 01:33:30,362
Unfortunately, our history and the data about civil rights and civil liberties demonstrate that there is a need for oversight, for a democratic process, for public and legal oversight to ensure the equitable implementation of justice and safety services, because it has not been just.

1072
01:33:31,143 --> 01:33:35,685
And we do need to put processes in place to make sure that it gets just.

1073
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:45,029
The city council has spoken regularly about transparency and accountability, and is wagging its finger regularly about that.

1074
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:51,199
So I ask you my elected representative representatives to vote in favor of this ordinance.

1075
01:33:51,619 --> 01:34:09,007
to ensure that transparency and accountability and protection of all of our civil liberties are assured by law in the use of the tools that have an impact on my civil liberties, on my civil rights, which we, as we have already heard, this technology does.

1076
01:34:09,467 --> 01:34:14,089
It has an impact on my civil rights, and I want you to control it.

1077
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:22,465
I expect my government to represent the rights of all of our citizens and the values that have been expressed by the other speakers who've chosen to speak.

1078
01:34:23,005 --> 01:34:31,971
I do not expect my city council to be afraid to vote in favor of ordinances that clearly protect civil liberties and accountability to their electors.

1079
01:34:32,471 --> 01:34:39,235
This is simply the right thing to do to protect all of us and to protect our civil servants' ability to do their jobs.

1080
01:34:39,496 --> 01:34:41,117
Please vote in favor of this ordinance.

1081
01:34:41,557 --> 01:34:41,897
Thank you.

1082
01:34:42,858 --> 01:34:43,118
Thank you.

1083
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:44,452
Madam President.

1084
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:47,234
Is there anyone else?

1085
01:34:47,495 --> 01:34:48,575
I don't see any hands up on zoom.

1086
01:34:48,595 --> 01:34:49,216
Is there anyone else?

1087
01:34:49,596 --> 01:34:50,717
Uh, Mr. Castagnetti.

1088
01:34:51,538 --> 01:34:51,798
Okay.

1089
01:34:53,059 --> 01:34:53,499
You came back.

1090
01:34:57,362 --> 01:34:57,802
Welcome back.

1091
01:35:02,966 --> 01:35:03,967
Hang on one minute.

1092
01:35:03,987 --> 01:35:04,447
There you go.

1093
01:35:05,288 --> 01:35:05,648
Thank you.

1094
01:35:06,729 --> 01:35:12,353
Um, I'm very, I don't understand this 14 page, I believe ordinance.

1095
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:18,222
And I don't think 99% of the people in the city understand that either, nor have they even read it.

1096
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:26,845
I'm hearing things that sound pretty touching on both ends of the spectrum here.

1097
01:35:28,546 --> 01:35:35,168
To be fully honest and full disclosure, I am a Woodstock graduate, 1969 in Bethel.

1098
01:35:37,289 --> 01:35:40,370
And I wasn't a big fan of cops in those days.

1099
01:35:41,724 --> 01:35:46,186
or Big Brother putting their nose in our business still.

1100
01:35:47,487 --> 01:35:55,150
However, if something is happening that's violent and it's not fair, I mean, who are you gonna call?

1101
01:35:56,611 --> 01:36:02,393
I think people wanna call the cops, not Ghostbusters or Dr. Phil or Phyllis.

1102
01:36:03,354 --> 01:36:09,156
You're in deep trouble, and chances are, even if they're like three houses away, they won't get there in time, mind you.

1103
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:14,364
I just have one concern.

1104
01:36:16,546 --> 01:36:20,128
Not that I'm a fan of cameras, the big brother thing.

1105
01:36:20,548 --> 01:36:37,841
However, if a camera catches someone stabbing you, I would hope, I wouldn't hope, I would demand that that video, if it's authentic and not fake, should be shown in a court of law to

1106
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:43,159
Convict the culprit.

1107
01:36:45,182 --> 01:36:46,805
And it should be colorblind, the camera.

1108
01:36:48,287 --> 01:36:48,667
Period.

1109
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:52,232
Thank you, Madam President.

1110
01:36:52,292 --> 01:36:54,956
Motion to approve the paper for first reading as amended.

1111
01:36:55,503 --> 01:36:56,684
Any further discussion from the council?

1112
01:36:56,704 --> 01:36:57,245
Councilor Say?

1113
01:36:57,545 --> 01:37:01,729
Just a very short comment from my personal perspective, having served on the committee.

1114
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:08,256
I wanted to thank all of our speakers tonight for being so eloquent, no matter what they were speaking for.

1115
01:37:08,717 --> 01:37:17,986
When I think about this ordinance in front of us, I think about democracy, transparency, and productivity, and with the combination of those three, building trust in government.

1116
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:23,290
I think the process that we've gone through really highlights the best of democracy.

1117
01:37:23,711 --> 01:37:31,556
We've had good faith negotiations, compromise, we've had activists who've engaged their elected officials on an issue that they've really cared about.

1118
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:37,080
And as a young person of color, I especially thank you guys for that work.

1119
01:37:37,981 --> 01:37:43,665
Because there's a lot of, the fact is that there's a lot of work that we can do to rebuild trust.

1120
01:37:45,046 --> 01:37:47,628
And this is the first step of many that we can take.

1121
01:37:48,349 --> 01:37:49,730
And it's an exciting step.

1122
01:37:51,411 --> 01:38:04,383
I truly do believe that this product is tailor made for a city and look, people might not be completely happy with it, no matter the side of the political political spectrum but that is a it's a fact of compromise and

1123
01:38:04,943 --> 01:38:05,963
It's a feature of democracy.

1124
01:38:07,224 --> 01:38:25,991
I especially, I think, like how this ordinance uses community-centric approach to make us a public forum where residents can make their opinions heard, where they can learn about what we're doing as a city, and where we can help facilitate a trusting relationship between city government and our residents.

1125
01:38:26,892 --> 01:38:32,694
And by letting the public have a voice in our discussions, I think we're really just crowdsourcing their knowledge

1126
01:38:35,575 --> 01:38:36,856
making more critical decisions.

1127
01:38:37,136 --> 01:38:39,576
And so with that, I'll second the motion to approve.

1128
01:38:40,276 --> 01:38:41,057
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1129
01:38:41,437 --> 01:38:46,438
And if I could just briefly from the chair, I also want to say thank the chief and everyone who worked on this.

1130
01:38:47,758 --> 01:38:55,340
Just the amount of, I think, good faith discussion around this and kind of moving the needle both ways, I think is a model for things going forward.

1131
01:38:55,820 --> 01:39:02,061
And I just want to say for me, in addition to everything that's been said tonight, for me, it comes down to the technology.

1132
01:39:02,222 --> 01:39:03,782
It's not a lack of faith in

1133
01:39:04,522 --> 01:39:10,906
You Chief, I absolutely have very much faith in you, and I think we've had a lot of great conversations that I really appreciated.

1134
01:39:11,727 --> 01:39:22,994
But the technology, it evolves at such a rapid rate, and I think we've seen, and it's a known fact that ethics are often a last thought when it comes to technology, if a thought at all.

1135
01:39:23,474 --> 01:39:25,836
And I think this is just something that's putting guardrails on that.

1136
01:39:25,876 --> 01:39:31,980
It doesn't, as it's been, but I just want to reiterate, even though it's been said, it doesn't ban or even comment on any specific technology.

1137
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:35,892
but it gives the opportunity for us to know what might be used in our city.

1138
01:39:36,353 --> 01:39:45,016
And I do think one of the residents too, I believe was Mr. Harris just saying that this is a real opportunity for 21st century community policing.

1139
01:39:45,216 --> 01:39:51,379
I think it really gives them having the community able just to know what's going on is really, really important.

1140
01:39:51,399 --> 01:39:53,300
And this is an important step towards that.

1141
01:39:53,460 --> 01:40:00,003
So I thank everyone for their work on this for all of their comments and thoughts and for being here once again tonight to discuss this.

1142
01:40:00,919 --> 01:40:02,880
We have a motion on the floor from Vice President Behrs.

1143
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,241
Councilor Kerrio?

1144
01:40:04,321 --> 01:40:06,602
Are we passing the amendments first?

1145
01:40:07,942 --> 01:40:12,244
The motion is to approve as amended for first reading.

1146
01:40:12,444 --> 01:40:13,685
So we're just doing the amendments first?

1147
01:40:14,365 --> 01:40:15,986
Or the whole paper?

1148
01:40:16,206 --> 01:40:18,507
The motion is to take all the amendments, so.

1149
01:40:19,228 --> 01:40:21,549
Well, if we need two votes, I propose the amendments.

1150
01:40:21,669 --> 01:40:24,570
If you want to vote on the amendments and then vote on the paper, I'm more than fine with that.

1151
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:26,131
I think we should vote.

1152
01:40:26,151 --> 01:40:27,892
I think we should.

1153
01:40:28,732 --> 01:40:29,753
We can take the amendments.

1154
01:40:36,559 --> 01:40:40,182
I'll withdraw my second motion and I'll move to amend the ordinance as I had read earlier.

1155
01:40:40,822 --> 01:40:41,062
Okay.

1156
01:40:41,903 --> 01:40:55,073
So on the motion of Vice President Behrs to amend the ordinance based on the 12 amendments presented earlier that are also in the hands of the clerk, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1157
01:40:55,534 --> 01:40:56,635
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1158
01:41:26,911 --> 01:41:27,451
Councilor Collins.

1159
01:41:27,652 --> 01:41:27,852
Yes.

1160
01:41:29,453 --> 01:41:29,913
Councilor Neidt.

1161
01:41:30,174 --> 01:41:30,414
Yes.

1162
01:41:32,135 --> 01:41:32,776
Councilor Stroud.

1163
01:41:33,136 --> 01:41:33,356
Yes.

1164
01:41:35,278 --> 01:41:35,758
Councilor Seng.

1165
01:41:35,898 --> 01:41:36,098
Yes.

1166
01:41:36,118 --> 01:41:37,319
Vice President Barrett.

1167
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:37,880
Yes.

1168
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:40,482
I have an information on the night of the motion passes.

1169
01:41:41,443 --> 01:41:43,785
Motion to approve the ordinance for first reading as amended.

1170
01:41:44,285 --> 01:41:50,370
On the motion of Vice President Barrett to approve the ordinance for first reading as amended, seconded by Councilor Seng.

1171
01:41:51,551 --> 01:41:52,672
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1172
01:42:00,462 --> 01:42:00,642
Yes.

1173
01:42:00,662 --> 01:42:00,782
Yes.

1174
01:42:00,802 --> 01:42:00,882
Yes.

1175
01:42:00,922 --> 01:42:05,385
For the affirmative three in the negative the motion passes.

1176
01:42:05,465 --> 01:42:07,186
Passes for first reading.

1177
01:42:07,466 --> 01:42:10,848
Okay, so we have one more paper.

1178
01:42:31,194 --> 01:42:49,386
to one that's 053 offered by Councilor Collins housing stability notification ordinance motion to suspend the reading in favor of a brief summary on the motion of vices and affairs to suspend the reading in favor of a brief summary seconded by Councilor Gabriella all those in favor, I suppose motion passes, going back to you once more Councilor Collins very brief summary.

1179
01:42:50,547 --> 01:42:51,808
Thank you, President Brown.

1180
01:42:53,095 --> 01:42:57,557
What a treat to have two of my ordinance projects come before the council on the very same night.

1181
01:42:57,617 --> 01:42:58,397
Good thing it's a holiday.

1182
01:42:59,198 --> 01:43:01,319
I'm very glad to be bringing this forward tonight.

1183
01:43:01,619 --> 01:43:05,520
This paper was first proposed by Councilor John Falco in 2021.

1184
01:43:06,041 --> 01:43:11,343
Very grateful to him for proposing this paper and for the opportunity to carry the project forward as Housing Subcommittee Chair.

1185
01:43:12,383 --> 01:43:15,945
In contrast to the ordinance that we just discussed, this ordinance is extremely simple.

1186
01:43:16,685 --> 01:43:28,776
It creates a new requirement that all property owners in Medford distribute a simple, perhaps one or two page document prepared for them by the city to their tenants at the beginning and termination of any lease or upon eviction.

1187
01:43:29,296 --> 01:43:32,419
This document would also be provided to homeowners that are being foreclosed upon.

1188
01:43:33,059 --> 01:43:40,305
The goal of this policy is to make sure that all residents in Medford are aware of the housing rights to which they are already entitled, and the resources that are already available to them.

1189
01:43:41,106 --> 01:43:46,969
People should know what their rights are, what to expect, and where to turn for help before some kind of stressful or emergency situation occurs.

1190
01:43:47,490 --> 01:43:48,890
This information is often hard to find.

1191
01:43:49,651 --> 01:43:56,495
Whether you're a tenant, an owner, or an owner being foreclosed upon, having to scramble for information, or not know where to turn for help benefits nobody.

1192
01:43:57,195 --> 01:44:01,918
This ordinance ensures that relevant information is distributed through the community in a streamlined way proactively.

1193
01:44:02,758 --> 01:44:05,180
I want to just briefly outline the process of this project.

1194
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:10,983
The council has been meeting on this paper since the fall first in the housing subcommittee, and then in a recent committee of the whole.

1195
01:44:11,563 --> 01:44:18,768
We began by discussing the examples of three of our neighboring communities, Cambridge Boston and Somerville, who also have housing stability notification ordinances.

1196
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:23,770
We compared and contrasted these ordinances and selected the best parts of each example.

1197
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:28,912
We also reviewed the actual notification document that's currently used in each of these cities to inform our discussion.

1198
01:44:29,633 --> 01:44:33,615
At every step we discussed the ordinance with the city departments that would be implicated by this ordinance.

1199
01:44:34,275 --> 01:44:37,276
These partners included the Board of Health, which stepped up to do enforcement.

1200
01:44:37,977 --> 01:44:42,259
The Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability volunteered to create the housing notification document.

1201
01:44:43,103 --> 01:44:49,865
based on resource documents that their office already has available, and they also consulted on how to best begin the rollout of this ordinance.

1202
01:44:50,526 --> 01:44:58,928
The Office of Prevention and Outreach, whose work in our community is closely aligned with the goals of this ordinance, offered their insight on equity and implementation strategies.

1203
01:44:59,729 --> 01:45:08,792
I'm very heartened that this ordinance has the approval and even the enthusiasm of our city departments that are already responsible for housing stability and community outreach projects in our community.

1204
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:14,002
Finally, I just want to say this is an ordinance that is primarily intended as an educational tool.

1205
01:45:14,662 --> 01:45:27,607
Thanks to the collaboration and the input of our city partners, I believe that this ordinance will be simple to implement and serve as another tool toolbox for promoting stable housing in Medford, through expanding awareness of existing housing rights and resources in our community.

1206
01:45:28,107 --> 01:45:28,367
Thank you.

1207
01:45:30,228 --> 01:45:30,988
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1208
01:45:31,008 --> 01:45:31,449
Councilor Knight.

1209
01:45:31,889 --> 01:45:33,489
I'm looking at this.

1210
01:45:33,509 --> 01:45:38,972
I have a question as to how it would work relative to the students in the dormitories

1211
01:45:43,201 --> 01:45:46,584
Has that been under consideration or is that exempt from this?

1212
01:45:48,745 --> 01:45:52,268
You know, so students in the dorm, they say you gotta go, school's over.

1213
01:45:52,509 --> 01:45:53,810
Yeah, I don't wanna go, I wanna stay.

1214
01:45:54,310 --> 01:45:55,391
I wanna stay for the summer.

1215
01:45:56,131 --> 01:45:58,974
We gotta give you notice, you gotta take it through the eviction process.

1216
01:45:59,014 --> 01:46:02,517
I mean, I'm not sure, I'm trying to figure out how that would apply.

1217
01:46:02,977 --> 01:46:03,577
Councilor Collins?

1218
01:46:03,617 --> 01:46:04,358
To the university.

1219
01:46:04,818 --> 01:46:05,019
Yeah.

1220
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:09,382
Or off campus housing in the university for that matter, you know what I mean?

1221
01:46:09,402 --> 01:46:09,722
Sure, thank you.

1222
01:46:10,203 --> 01:46:10,383
Sorry?

1223
01:46:11,381 --> 01:46:13,329
I just don't know who to place a burden on the university.

1224
01:46:13,349 --> 01:46:15,337
I mean ultimately they house thousands of kids up there, right?

1225
01:46:16,557 --> 01:46:17,098
Councilor Collins.

1226
01:46:17,658 --> 01:46:19,520
Yeah, thank you for that question, Councilor Knight.

1227
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:26,566
This doesn't currently exempt any housing situations other than short or long-term like hospital care facilities in the city of Medford.

1228
01:46:27,607 --> 01:46:34,593
So I believe it would implicate student housing situations, whether that's private property owners or the dormitories themselves.

1229
01:46:35,734 --> 01:46:40,258
I wanna be clear, this doesn't create any new housing rights or responsibilities.

1230
01:46:40,339 --> 01:46:42,721
It doesn't create the right to remain

1231
01:46:43,982 --> 01:46:47,125
in a housing situation for longer than a person would already be able to do that.

1232
01:46:48,286 --> 01:46:52,130
It's just a simple document that's delivered upon move in and move out.

1233
01:46:52,570 --> 01:46:59,336
Right, but what it does do is it creates a punitive situation for where if the property owner fails to provide the certain notice, they're going to be fined $300 a day.

1234
01:46:59,417 --> 01:47:06,884
So if we have a property on a Tufts University that has 900 kids in housing, and they fail to comply,

1235
01:47:08,273 --> 01:47:11,780
900 times 300 times 300 times every day at the fine.

1236
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:12,481
You know what I mean?

1237
01:47:12,782 --> 01:47:14,124
They're one of our bodies in the community.

1238
01:47:14,144 --> 01:47:15,667
We don't want to put an administrative burden on them.

1239
01:47:15,687 --> 01:47:16,508
It's going to be punitive.

1240
01:47:20,373 --> 01:47:21,073
I support the paper.

1241
01:47:21,093 --> 01:47:22,974
I just, I think the fines excessive really is what it is.

1242
01:47:23,014 --> 01:47:25,334
I mean, if it was 25 bucks or something like that, yeah, fine.

1243
01:47:25,354 --> 01:47:28,015
300 bucks for not sending somebody a notice about what their rights are when they get evicted.

1244
01:47:28,555 --> 01:47:29,255
When, you know what I mean?

1245
01:47:29,435 --> 01:47:31,956
We have all heard the term caveat emptied by everywhere, right?

1246
01:47:32,776 --> 01:47:37,817
You also have to be able to have some accountability personally and know what your rights are as well, right?

1247
01:47:37,837 --> 01:47:40,418
It's not government's job to hold everybody's hand all the time, right?

1248
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:43,599
Some people have to have some certain personal accountability, right?

1249
01:47:43,619 --> 01:47:45,899
So if you run into a situation where you're gonna be evicted, right?

1250
01:47:46,359 --> 01:47:47,700
You might wanna say, hey, what are my rights?

1251
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,540
Cause I'm being evicted.

1252
01:47:50,615 --> 01:47:52,176
and have some personal accountability as well.

1253
01:47:52,617 --> 01:48:00,043
I just think that the $300 fine is very excessive, especially because it's for every day that passes, it's another $300, and it constitutes another violation.

1254
01:48:00,523 --> 01:48:04,426
If we brought that down to, you know, 25 bucks or 50 bucks, I would have a problem.

1255
01:48:05,908 --> 01:48:07,089
Councillor Collins, Advices and Affairs.

1256
01:48:08,109 --> 01:48:08,810
Thank you, President Morrell.

1257
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:12,113
Thank you, Councillor Knight, for entertaining this line of questions.

1258
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:19,759
I think that we discussed similar issues with the Director of the Board of Health at our recent

1259
01:48:20,183 --> 01:48:23,264
committee of the whole around enforcement, the fee structure, fine structure.

1260
01:48:24,305 --> 01:48:32,248
The $300 was booked because it's statutorily defined and also because it's commensurate with other fines for ordinances that we already have in the books in the city of Medford.

1261
01:48:32,728 --> 01:48:44,472
More importantly, when we discussed, when we were kind of first hashing out who would enforce the ordinance earlier in the subcommittee process after it was determined that it'd be more appropriate for it to be the Board of Health rather than code enforcement.

1262
01:48:45,813 --> 01:48:46,553
You know, like I said,

1263
01:48:47,324 --> 01:48:50,686
I think this is a phrase that I probably borrowed directly from Director O'Connor.

1264
01:48:50,706 --> 01:48:52,907
This is primarily intended to be an educational tool.

1265
01:48:53,388 --> 01:48:59,471
This ordinance isn't on the books that we can go around issuing $300 fines to landlords that don't know that this is something they're supposed to be doing.

1266
01:49:00,132 --> 01:49:11,038
After all, the penalty for the first warning is a written fine, and this is to be endorsed, sorry, enforced at the discretion of, in this case, the Board of Health Director or their designee.

1267
01:49:11,078 --> 01:49:13,720
So I say that to say, I don't think that this is the kind of thing where

1268
01:49:14,777 --> 01:49:30,827
You know, if a landlord is delinked and accidentally, or we have some kind of extenuating circumstance, overall, it's at the discretion of the director of the Board of Health to enforce this towards the goal of actually promoting housing stability, not towards it generating revenue.

1269
01:49:30,867 --> 01:49:35,369
And that was a discussion that we had pretty explicitly with the Board of Health director earlier in this ordinance process.

1270
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:42,954
That discretion part is what makes me curious, especially after listening to what Mr. Harris had to say a few minutes ago.

1271
01:49:44,082 --> 01:49:45,623
What's good for the goose should be good for the gander.

1272
01:49:45,643 --> 01:49:46,524
It shouldn't be at discretion.

1273
01:49:46,564 --> 01:49:47,784
If it's violation, it's a violation.

1274
01:49:47,804 --> 01:49:49,105
If it's not, it's not, right?

1275
01:49:49,566 --> 01:49:55,549
I mean, ultimately what we're doing is putting language in here to say that the board of health director can haphazardly policy if they see fit, right?

1276
01:49:56,070 --> 01:49:57,210
And fine up to $300, right?

1277
01:49:57,371 --> 01:49:59,172
I don't think that's what we're looking to do.

1278
01:49:59,212 --> 01:50:00,953
I don't think that's what the goal objective is.

1279
01:50:03,363 --> 01:50:07,427
So ultimately, we're saying the Board of Health Director may at their discretion do this, right?

1280
01:50:07,808 --> 01:50:09,810
So ultimately, we're talking about issues of equity.

1281
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:11,592
We're talking about government not being trusted.

1282
01:50:12,052 --> 01:50:13,914
We're talking about putting controls in on government.

1283
01:50:14,915 --> 01:50:19,680
But then we're going to give somebody the authority to act haphazard and apply policy unevenly.

1284
01:50:21,702 --> 01:50:23,103
So the specific things here, number one,

1285
01:50:27,761 --> 01:50:31,202
Tufts could just give this to all the students that they house, and that would be fine.

1286
01:50:31,222 --> 01:50:35,083
It'd be another packet in the many packets of papers that they give to their students.

1287
01:50:37,483 --> 01:50:45,925
And secondly, when it comes to off-campus housing, that would be private landlords, and therefore they would be providing this information to their tenants or the other residents.

1288
01:50:47,225 --> 01:50:54,507
When students sign an agreement to enter dormitory housing, they sign a specific contract for a specific period that's very different from a standard rental lease.

1289
01:50:56,961 --> 01:50:58,942
requirements, penalties and needs around that are different.

1290
01:50:59,142 --> 01:51:12,488
I, you know, generally you don't see students squatting after, you know, homecoming or, sorry not homecoming, but you know, graduation just to try to uphold their eviction rights for 60 days.

1291
01:51:12,528 --> 01:51:15,330
I don't think I've ever seen that at any university that I've ever been a part of.

1292
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:23,454
When it comes to the discretion piece, there's nothing in here that says the board of health may do what they want or the health director may do what they want.

1293
01:51:23,514 --> 01:51:25,114
It's just a common understanding that

1294
01:51:27,689 --> 01:51:38,777
any level of government in this country, state, federal, local, the executive branch is the branch that enforces the law and they may enforce that law at their discretion, right?

1295
01:51:38,817 --> 01:51:41,259
We see that with a number of things with

1296
01:51:41,775 --> 01:51:50,121
You can go from president to president, and some presidents choose to enforce certain parts of the law, and some presidents choose to enforce different parts of the law, and we have lots of debates around that.

1297
01:51:50,922 --> 01:52:01,270
Going back to Councilor Collins' point initially, I think that really is the crux of this is we had the conversations about what is this gonna look like, how is it gonna be implemented, and what is the purpose that it's gonna serve?

1298
01:52:02,271 --> 01:52:04,633
And it's going to be a document,

1299
01:52:05,818 --> 01:52:14,732
Developed can even kind of a modification of existing documents that have been created around the rights of renters and homeowners and their and their housing rights and resources, it's going to be.

1300
01:52:16,058 --> 01:52:29,583
created by the city, distributed to property owners, and primarily the goal is to have it be an educational tool to ensure that everyone in the city, whether you're a homeowner or a landlord, a tenant, or anyone else, has a clear picture of what your rights are.

1301
01:52:30,403 --> 01:52:35,785
And in terms of the specifics of enforcement, the first violation is a written warning.

1302
01:52:35,945 --> 01:52:38,346
The second violation is the fine that you noted.

1303
01:52:38,906 --> 01:52:41,627
Pursuant to Chapter 40, Section 21D of Mass General Law,

1304
01:52:43,249 --> 01:52:51,901
And even more so than that I did a fine per incident not a fine per day so it wouldn't be $300 a day would be if someone.

1305
01:52:52,842 --> 01:52:58,109
And again, the intent here, both the intent of us and the intent of the administration that we worked with is that this is not just

1306
01:52:59,176 --> 01:53:12,520
know, going around and finding people willy nilly, it's trying to get folks to provide the relevant legal information to everyone who has housing in the city so that they can better understand what their options are in any situation.

1307
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:20,042
But in any case, the way that it would be implemented, or the way that the enforcement structure is written,

1308
01:53:20,993 --> 01:53:33,527
If I'm a landlord and I didn't provide my tenant this information, and I was then told about the existence of this ordinance, and then I started providing the information, that wouldn't be an issue.

1309
01:53:33,567 --> 01:53:41,577
If I didn't provide the information, was told about the ordinance, and then continued on to provide the information for whatever reason, then I could be given a written warning.

1310
01:53:42,299 --> 01:53:52,025
And then if I didn't provide it to a tenant on the inception or the termination of a tenancy or a lease, then I would be fined $300 one time, not $300 a day until I provided the information.

1311
01:53:52,565 --> 01:53:52,905
Thank you.

1312
01:53:53,306 --> 01:53:54,346
Thank you, Councilor Spadafore.

1313
01:53:54,566 --> 01:53:55,447
That's not the way I read it.

1314
01:53:55,467 --> 01:53:57,028
Thank you, Madam President.

1315
01:53:57,108 --> 01:54:11,537
And again, not to disrespect my fellow councilors that are speaking on this issue, but again, the intent of law and the understanding, we do not have anyone behind this rail that's an attorney.

1316
01:54:12,668 --> 01:54:18,172
which poses another issue and concern that we have with a lack of this.

1317
01:54:18,852 --> 01:54:36,645
And like I said, I'll say it again, most communities is there's representation for the council that's present with us that you can call the podium and ask these questions to make sure we're protecting us, the fiscal responsibilities of the community and our laws.

1318
01:54:37,125 --> 01:54:38,727
And again, it just,

1319
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:51,160
I don't think that people, my frustration comes in understanding how serious this is without not having legal representation as we move forward with these ordinances.

1320
01:54:51,941 --> 01:54:53,783
So again, just something I needed to share.

1321
01:54:54,443 --> 01:54:54,704
Thank you.

1322
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:00,920
Sorry.

1323
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:07,322
Thank you President well, um, for me this is pretty straightforward.

1324
01:55:07,342 --> 01:55:13,944
I look at the housing stability and the vision ordinance I see something that has generated support from different parts of town.

1325
01:55:14,865 --> 01:55:18,766
I think this is fundamentally, fundamentally about transparent and helpful governance.

1326
01:55:20,167 --> 01:55:24,930
And the idea that we're all better off when we know what our rights are and we know what resources we have access to.

1327
01:55:26,311 --> 01:55:33,036
Access to information can be hard, especially to those who don't know who to ask for resources, where to look for information.

1328
01:55:33,056 --> 01:55:47,146
And some people who might fall into those buckets are older folks who might not be internet savvy, immigrants who might not speak English, and people who just moved to Medford or have moved to Massachusetts for the first time and they don't really know what

1329
01:55:48,626 --> 01:55:49,807
how our institutions work here.

1330
01:55:51,107 --> 01:56:02,970
I also want to commend the people who've put so much work into writing this ordinance for making sure that it meets our goals when it comes to equity in housing.

1331
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:06,831
There's language in here that talks about language access.

1332
01:56:06,891 --> 01:56:11,952
There's language in here that really addresses print versus digital media.

1333
01:56:12,452 --> 01:56:14,273
And I think it's,

1334
01:56:14,933 --> 01:56:28,640
This is one of those kind of pieces of legislation that we have in front of us that has, I think, a newer perspective on how we can solve these long lasting challenges.

1335
01:56:29,621 --> 01:56:30,601
I think it's also important to

1336
01:56:31,902 --> 01:56:36,506
to state again that our city staff have been supporting us the whole way with this.

1337
01:56:37,066 --> 01:56:38,707
They know that we have the ability to do this.

1338
01:56:38,747 --> 01:56:40,128
We do have the ability to do this.

1339
01:56:40,729 --> 01:56:47,874
And we have the ability to build a fair economy in the housing market where we do look out for the little guy.

1340
01:56:47,994 --> 01:56:50,736
And we look out for tenants.

1341
01:56:50,776 --> 01:56:56,901
We look out for the tenant landlord relationship and for people being foreclosed upon.

1342
01:56:58,124 --> 01:56:58,764
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

1343
01:56:59,625 --> 01:57:00,805
Any further discussion from the Council?

1344
01:57:01,325 --> 01:57:08,928
Just, Madam President, if it's about transparency, right, and it's about making sure that people are aware of something, then why are we attaching a punitive measure to it, right?

1345
01:57:08,968 --> 01:57:10,349
Why are we attaching a fine at the end of it?

1346
01:57:12,022 --> 01:57:15,285
if it's about transparency and it's about making sure that people have knowledge, right?

1347
01:57:15,585 --> 01:57:21,831
I mean, this is always an excuse when it comes up to something, this is some reason why the people aren't competent enough to pursue what it is they need to pursue.

1348
01:57:21,871 --> 01:57:23,572
There's always a reason we're trying to pass something.

1349
01:57:23,592 --> 01:57:24,934
What about the person that doesn't have internet?

1350
01:57:24,974 --> 01:57:28,597
Yeah, that one person, like, come on, it's 2023, the internet is everywhere.

1351
01:57:28,997 --> 01:57:29,878
They're giving phones away.

1352
01:57:31,339 --> 01:57:33,240
You walk into the store, they're giving you a phone for free.

1353
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:34,060
You know what I mean?

1354
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:34,300
Come on.

1355
01:57:34,461 --> 01:57:35,721
Everybody has access to the internet.

1356
01:57:35,761 --> 01:57:38,583
If not, there's plenty of places to access the internet, number one, number two.

1357
01:57:38,603 --> 01:57:42,806
You know, I don't think that we give the general populace enough credit sometimes.

1358
01:57:43,827 --> 01:57:46,368
All right, we don't give the general populace enough credit sometimes.

1359
01:57:47,529 --> 01:57:54,533
But with that being said, I'd motion to strike the fine from $300 to $50, and then I'll move for approval.

1360
01:57:54,553 --> 01:57:57,475
We have a motion from Councilor Collins.

1361
01:57:57,775 --> 01:57:58,556
Can we take those separately?

1362
01:57:59,743 --> 01:58:04,027
Uh, do you have a, um, would you sever?

1363
01:58:04,047 --> 01:58:07,129
Are you asking to sever or would you sever those two?

1364
01:58:07,209 --> 01:58:07,610
Councilor Knight?

1365
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:11,353
Well, I'm going to, I mean, I'm making the motion to make it 50 bucks.

1366
01:58:11,433 --> 01:58:13,674
And then if it passes, I'll move for approval.

1367
01:58:13,915 --> 01:58:18,799
So we have a motion from Councilor Knight to adjust the, um, fine to $50.

1368
01:58:19,539 --> 01:58:19,980
Second.

1369
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:21,521
Seconded by Vice President Behrs.

1370
01:58:22,462 --> 01:58:24,123
Uh, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1371
01:58:24,924 --> 01:58:26,285
If I may add the motion.

1372
01:58:26,845 --> 01:58:28,527
Councilor, uh, Vice President Behrs.

1373
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:31,842
The reason there's a fine is that there.

1374
01:58:33,143 --> 01:58:39,529
Otherwise, if no one if people don't do it and the city doesn't have any authority to further ask them to do it.

1375
01:58:40,390 --> 01:58:51,241
I don't mind if we reduce the fine, but also if we find out because the finest so is that an amount that is not sufficient to convince a property owner to otherwise follow the law.

1376
01:58:52,486 --> 01:58:53,627
then I think we'd have to revisit that.

1377
01:58:53,947 --> 01:58:55,608
So I'm fine, we'll test it out at 50.

1378
01:58:55,688 --> 01:59:08,318
I mean, again, as we said, the intent was educational and my understanding is that at least on the first pass and probably multiple passes of going through the property on our list and asking them to submit this, the Board of Health won't issue fines at all.

1379
01:59:08,578 --> 01:59:20,447
But again, I think if we come back here and find out, we hear from the Board of Health, well, there's 200 problem properties in the city that aren't gonna issue this because they'll pay 50 bucks and they have an objection to it, then we may have to come back and revisit it.

1380
01:59:21,292 --> 01:59:26,193
I mean, ultimately what we're doing is we're asking the landlord to give a piece of paper that the city puts together to the tenant.

1381
01:59:26,793 --> 01:59:28,494
We're gonna charge them 300 bucks if they don't do that.

1382
01:59:28,634 --> 01:59:29,494
That's a little much.

1383
01:59:29,854 --> 01:59:33,815
That's a little crazy, but I support the, I appreciate the council's second on the motion.

1384
01:59:35,035 --> 01:59:39,996
On the motion of Councilor Knight to strike the $300 and change it to 50, seconded by Vice President Ferris.

1385
01:59:40,036 --> 01:59:45,077
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1386
01:59:45,137 --> 01:59:48,938
Vice President Ferris.

1387
01:59:50,855 --> 01:59:51,155
Yes.

1388
01:59:52,816 --> 01:59:55,858
Yes.

1389
01:59:58,439 --> 01:59:58,639
Yes.

1390
01:59:59,499 --> 02:00:01,941
Yes.

1391
02:00:02,041 --> 02:00:04,142
No.

1392
02:00:04,322 --> 02:00:04,482
No.

1393
02:00:05,262 --> 02:00:07,203
For me for three and a motion passes.

1394
02:00:09,505 --> 02:00:11,085
Vice Councilor night.

1395
02:00:11,305 --> 02:00:13,246
One more moment of motion to exempt Tufts University.

1396
02:00:15,227 --> 02:00:18,309
Motion to accept Tufts University on campus housing University.

1397
02:00:19,577 --> 02:00:22,979
on-campus housing, so Tufts-owned on-campus housing, motion to exempt?

1398
02:00:23,839 --> 02:00:25,900
Under B-5, I guess it would be.

1399
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:27,681
4933-B-5, new section.

1400
02:00:27,761 --> 02:00:38,447
So we have a motion from Councilor Knight to exempt Tufts University's on-campus housing, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

1401
02:00:40,228 --> 02:00:40,848
Roll call, please.

1402
02:00:51,019 --> 02:00:54,345
Councilor Collins.

1403
02:00:54,585 --> 02:00:54,926
Thank you.

1404
02:00:54,946 --> 02:01:02,098
I just wanted to note before we take the vote on this Council and I appreciate your amendment and thinking through this on the floor.

1405
02:01:03,847 --> 02:01:16,813
Having not considered such an amendment before, I think it's worth putting on the record that as a Tufts alumnus myself, I've seen firsthand, I don't think that this is an ordinance that would be in any way difficult for them to implement.

1406
02:01:16,833 --> 02:01:32,501
And I think that there is some value for an institution that professes to be a community partner to participate in such an ordinance so that should students move off campus after graduating from Tufts University, like myself, that they are given a headstart in, you know,

1407
02:01:33,281 --> 02:01:40,526
like we're talking about being aware of the housing rights and responsibilities and resources that they can expect from their community.

1408
02:01:40,626 --> 02:01:52,794
So I don't know that this is a major point, but I just felt it's worth expressing that I don't think it's going too far to ask a major and wealthy community partner to participate in a good faith ordinance.

1409
02:01:53,094 --> 02:01:53,354
Thank you.

1410
02:01:53,374 --> 02:01:55,836
Thank you Councilor Collins.

1411
02:01:55,856 --> 02:01:57,837
Do you have the motion, Mr. Clerk?

1412
02:02:02,597 --> 02:02:09,661
So the motion of councilor Knight to exempt tops on campus housing seconded by councilor Carviello, please call the roll.

1413
02:02:16,386 --> 02:02:16,526
No.

1414
02:02:16,546 --> 02:02:16,666
No.

1415
02:02:16,686 --> 02:02:16,786
Yes.

1416
02:02:16,806 --> 02:02:17,086
Yes.

1417
02:02:17,267 --> 02:02:17,387
No.

1418
02:02:31,061 --> 02:02:31,261
No.

1419
02:02:32,322 --> 02:02:34,303
Three in the affirmative, four in the negative, the motion fails.

1420
02:02:35,823 --> 02:02:36,424
Motion to approve.

1421
02:02:37,004 --> 02:02:45,447
On the motion of Councilor Knight to approve as amended by Councilor Knight for first reading, please call the roll.

1422
02:02:52,350 --> 02:02:53,091
Vice President Peers.

1423
02:02:53,311 --> 02:02:53,591
Yes.

1424
02:02:55,031 --> 02:02:55,592
Councilor Kerrio.

1425
02:02:55,612 --> 02:02:55,852
Yes.

1426
02:02:57,653 --> 02:02:58,233
Councilor Collins.

1427
02:02:58,353 --> 02:02:58,553
Yes.

1428
02:03:02,377 --> 02:03:02,577
No.

1429
02:03:04,219 --> 02:03:06,301
That's what I'm saying.

1430
02:03:06,621 --> 02:03:06,841
Yes.

1431
02:03:06,861 --> 02:03:06,921
Yes.

1432
02:03:07,022 --> 02:03:08,483
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1433
02:03:08,523 --> 02:03:09,804
The motion passes.

1434
02:03:10,525 --> 02:03:11,506
That is the end of our agenda.

1435
02:03:11,606 --> 02:03:12,987
Up to public participation.

1436
02:03:13,047 --> 02:03:15,710
Are there any members of the public who would like to speak?

1437
02:03:23,805 --> 02:03:24,765
Name and address for the record, please.

1438
02:03:24,945 --> 02:03:26,986
Steve Schnapp, 36 Hillside Avenue.

1439
02:03:28,467 --> 02:03:34,009
I actually wanted to say this about an hour and a half earlier when folks were discussing the post office.

1440
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:43,513
I just want to say, and if there's anybody here who knows the last name of postal carrier Joe in Medford Square,

1441
02:03:45,387 --> 02:03:47,888
We get our mail every day, unless he's sick.

1442
02:03:47,948 --> 02:03:51,349
And he had surgery, it was out for a while, and the mail was a little slippery.

1443
02:03:51,909 --> 02:03:53,149
Came back after surgery.

1444
02:03:53,589 --> 02:03:57,491
This is an older gentleman, he's probably gonna retire in a few years.

1445
02:03:58,711 --> 02:03:59,491
Not as old as me.

1446
02:04:02,212 --> 02:04:13,535
Also remember a couple of weeks ago, when the weather was below zero, and with freezing rain and snow, we were still getting our mail on that day.

1447
02:04:15,267 --> 02:04:26,844
So I just wanted to put that on the record so folks would know that there are a lot of postal workers who are trying their damnedest and who still believe that the mail should be delivered through snow, rain, ice, et cetera.

1448
02:04:27,686 --> 02:04:28,046
Thank you.

1449
02:04:28,146 --> 02:04:28,487
Thank you.

1450
02:04:29,803 --> 02:04:30,363
President Behrs.

1451
02:04:30,443 --> 02:04:40,167
Just to that point, I believe I also saw recently that according to the head of the post office here in Medford, they're down almost a third on their delivery staff right now.

1452
02:04:40,347 --> 02:04:42,027
And that's probably the main reason here.

1453
02:04:42,327 --> 02:04:45,909
And there's a variety of reasons that could be true.

1454
02:04:45,949 --> 02:04:50,370
But one of them is I think that our postal workers are underpaid significantly.

1455
02:04:50,410 --> 02:04:56,933
And I think that if we maybe should consider a resolution to encourage higher pay for postal workers, and maybe then we'll get

1456
02:04:58,416 --> 02:05:03,957
more filling of the openings in our current delivery services, open positions.

1457
02:05:04,097 --> 02:05:04,418
So thank you.
