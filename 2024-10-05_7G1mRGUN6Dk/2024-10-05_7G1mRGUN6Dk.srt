6
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:20,516
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you who don't know Russ, Russ was part of the core group that kept Chevalier open.

7
00:00:21,898 --> 00:00:24,060
[SPEAKER_03]: during the years when there was really nothing going on there.

8
00:00:25,502 --> 00:00:30,127

9
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:36,034
[SPEAKER_03]: But part of the reason we still have Shabai here today is because of the efforts of Russ and his group.

10
00:00:36,154 --> 00:00:41,220
[SPEAKER_03]: So Madam President, I'd ask that we dedicate this meeting in his honor this evening.

[SPEAKER_14]: He fell down an elevator shaft.

37
00:02:23,107 --> 00:02:26,349
[SPEAKER_14]: And from that day on, he had severe back pain.

38
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,053

39
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:37,216

00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:01,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Sincerely, thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

145
00:11:01,091 --> 00:11:02,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Sincerely, Brown and Woodford Mayor.

146
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:06,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I for one feels this is a good expense.

147
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:20,925
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I mean a good, a good initiative and a good endeavor because we look at the way that city's been spending money, lack of financial transparency anytime that we can set up a revolving fund or a trust fund to be sure that that money is being spent where it's supposed to be spent I think would make sense.

148
00:11:21,466 --> 00:11:31,453
[SPEAKER_08]: So, by approving this we're actually providing an additional check and balance and additional control on the frivolous and wasteful spending that we're seeing that's coming out of the administration and the lack of transparency that was coming out of administration.

149
00:11:32,153 --> 00:11:34,499
[SPEAKER_08]: So by approving this, we're going to be creating another layer of oversight.

150
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a good thing.

151
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:36,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd move for approval.

152
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:37,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

153
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:38,008
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

154
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:39,072
[SPEAKER_08]: and President.

155
00:11:40,273 --> 00:11:48,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I think that I think Councilor Knight bringing those words up, I think that it's important when we're looking at it with the oversight that's needed.

156
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,676
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's the only reason why I am voting for it.

157
00:11:52,796 --> 00:12:05,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything like I said, that deals with any fiscal responsibility or requests in this body, I would not support for the fact that we still have no idea of our fiscal future here.

158
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,180
[SPEAKER_07]: in the city.

159
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,442
[SPEAKER_07]: We have no, had no discussions with the mayor of the administration and guide us where we are financially.

160
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:18,424
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, that's a dire situation, but I would support this paper.

161
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:18,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

162
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:19,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

163
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:20,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Bears.

164
00:12:20,904 --> 00:12:21,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

165
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:27,926
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to see if Engineer Wirtala had any kind of short summary of what this is and what the Stormwater Board has been doing.

166
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:31,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello.

167
00:12:32,107 --> 00:12:33,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for having me.

168
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:38,126
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just a, we're setting up a stormwater regulations.

169
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:44,091
[SPEAKER_05]: There's new stormwater regulations that the city is required to do by federal law because we dump it to the Mystic River.

170
00:12:44,632 --> 00:12:53,039
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a, there is a fee going to be associated with that permit, and we need a revolving account to be associated with that fee.

171
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:57,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, any questions from the council?

172
00:13:00,044 --> 00:13:00,844
[SPEAKER_02]: questions from the public.

173
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:07,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, so on the motion, Councilor Knight to approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli for first reading.

174
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:08,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk.

175
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:10,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Does this require first reading?

176
00:13:10,147 --> 00:13:10,747
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not in order.

177
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:13,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I guess it is in order.

178
00:13:13,088 --> 00:13:14,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, my apologies.

179
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you are ready.

180
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:16,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

181
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:18,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello?

182
00:13:18,849 --> 00:13:19,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

183
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:22,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins?

184
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight?

185
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:26,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

186
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:28,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

187
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:29,472
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

188
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:36,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

189
00:13:36,327 --> 00:13:37,948
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion passes for first reading.

190
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:39,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

191
00:13:39,729 --> 00:13:41,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry, okay, one at a time.

192
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:42,070
[SPEAKER_02]: 23-039?

193
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, ma'am.

194
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,811
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that one?

195
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, all right.

196
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:09,522
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'll start with, I'll just order.

197
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:20,095
[SPEAKER_02]: 23-038 offered by Councilor Knight, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council request the city administration to deploy pothole crews to pass roadways with priority to emergency arteries in the city of Medford.

198
00:14:21,045 --> 00:14:21,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

199
00:14:21,866 --> 00:14:26,572
[SPEAKER_08]: No, thank you for sticking around to hear a couple of these resolutions that are on the agenda this evening.

200
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:29,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, the condition of our roadways in the city of deplorable.

201
00:14:31,257 --> 00:14:38,125
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you know what I think we all know, right, you could drive in front of Bob's food store for the past five years, and the bottle hasn't been

202
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:42,069
[SPEAKER_08]: patched even, never mind a plan to fix it.

203
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:53,242
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll drive around the Winthrop Street Rotary going down High Street and you'll cross over the first pedestrian crosswalk there and ever since the first Eversource project, the

204
00:14:54,612 --> 00:14:58,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Crosswalk has been sunken in for now eight, nine years now.

205
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:02,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I know our DPW, I know our commissioner, I know our mayor drives down these roads.

206
00:15:02,557 --> 00:15:11,864
[SPEAKER_08]: So I know that they know the condition of these roadways is terrible, but we need to develop some sort of plan, some sort of methodology for how we're gonna attack this.

207
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,346
[SPEAKER_08]: We have C-Click fix and we have 50 DPW members.

208
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:22,551
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see why we can't take them all one day and say, get on the roads, drive down our emergency arteries and document each pothole that's on there and then we can put a plan together.

209
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:28,372
[SPEAKER_08]: on how do we can patch these emergency arteries saving ultimately these the roads that our emergency vehicles drive down or EMS vehicles drive down.

210
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:35,154
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when there's a snow emergency, these are the vehicles that we're not allowed to park on, because these streets are used for public safety purposes.

211
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:36,895
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that it's something that we need to take a look at.

212
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:41,656
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm hoping that through the leadership of your office, you'll be able to come up with a plan on how we can address that.

213
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

214
00:15:44,036 --> 00:15:45,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other Councilors wish to speak before

215
00:15:47,254 --> 00:15:48,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

216
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:49,875
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank Councilor for putting this on.

217
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:51,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

218
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:52,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all drive down the streets.

219
00:15:52,496 --> 00:15:55,417
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all getting the same calls about the holes.

220
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:57,117
[SPEAKER_03]: They just keep getting bigger and bigger.

221
00:15:57,937 --> 00:16:02,459
[SPEAKER_03]: We patched them, especially when you get this hot weather and cold weather.

222
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,019
[SPEAKER_03]: patch comes out.

223
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:16,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So I agree with Councilor Layton, some type of plan has to be come up with to at least get the emergency arteries into some kind of shape that people don't keep getting flat tires.

224
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:21,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

225
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief Engineer Ortel, do you have anything you could share?

226
00:16:24,672 --> 00:16:25,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I have nothing to add.

227
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:27,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here for questions, if you have any.

228
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Any specific questions from the Council?

229
00:16:33,154 --> 00:16:33,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I have one.

230
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:40,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Golden Ave has been a topic of discussion now for going in the better part of five years.

231
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:48,242
[SPEAKER_08]: We appropriated some money to have the underground infrastructure of Golden Ave repaired and then also have the above ground infrastructure of Golden Ave repaired.

232
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:51,204
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that was supposed to take place over the summer.

233
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:54,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any idea what's going on with that project?

234
00:16:56,947 --> 00:17:00,189
[SPEAKER_05]: I really wasn't prepared to speak on those things.

235
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:01,990
[SPEAKER_05]: I will get you the information.

236
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:02,310
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

237
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions from the council?

238
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:11,353
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take you for public, we'll take you.

239
00:17:11,373 --> 00:17:15,935
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so Mr. Wardeller, if you want to, Mr. Casagnani, if you want to come up and speak.

240
00:17:22,658 --> 00:17:33,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, since this subject has come up again and again and again, I recollect when Councilor De La Ruza was here, he called the plot holes plot holders.

241
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,693
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyways, I brought this up years ago.

242
00:17:37,713 --> 00:17:46,861
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of understand why you fix a pothole, and then it regurgitates, and it becomes a pothole again after it was patched.

243
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:48,642
[SPEAKER_14]: I brought this up years ago.

244
00:17:49,162 --> 00:18:04,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe we should reach out to other TPW yachts, such as Buffalo, New York, or Montreal, Quebec, wherever, someplace in Maine, where they have probably more potholes than we have, since they probably use more salt.

245
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:11,898
[SPEAKER_14]: If I DPW could reach out our administration, maybe there's a better way to build a mousetrap.

246
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:23,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe if you cut them at an angle, what a task skills are, I'm not sure, whether it's slanted in or slanted out, or different type of material.

247
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,703
[SPEAKER_14]: but it seems like we're fighting mother nature and it's the same old song and dance.

248
00:18:29,163 --> 00:18:33,547
[SPEAKER_14]: I've also lost two tires on the old 2155 out streets.

249
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:41,072
[SPEAKER_14]: I have yet to put in to get paid for one, but I think this time it's more time.

250
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:47,877
[SPEAKER_14]: And of course, Councilor Knight lost two at one shot on Mystic Avenue, but you gotta pay attention out there too.

251
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:49,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Good memory, thank you.

252
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,164
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor?

253
00:18:56,784 --> 00:18:57,485
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

254
00:18:57,525 --> 00:18:58,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

255
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:01,148
[SPEAKER_02]: 23-039 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

256
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:08,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council have the city engineer report back with the repaving schedule for Bower, Holton, Temple, and Tontine streets this spring.

257
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:15,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it further resolved that the public utilities pave curb to curb similar to the same standards private contractors are held to when they open the streets.

258
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:17,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

259
00:19:18,103 --> 00:19:19,724
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're doing Ellington Street now.

260
00:19:19,765 --> 00:19:20,705
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that's open.

261
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:24,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a schedule of when these streets are going to be paved?

262
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:28,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm assuming they're going to be paved crib to crib, correct?

263
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:34,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're holding private contractors and making them pave crib to crib when they open the street.

264
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:37,017
[SPEAKER_03]: So public utilities should be up to the same standard.

265
00:19:38,738 --> 00:19:44,162
[SPEAKER_05]: By law, they're only allowed to repave their trench.

266
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:49,495
[SPEAKER_03]: We've this council passed a resolution seven years ago, when Council March is here.

267
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:54,517
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding is that the state Supreme Court ruled that all they have to do is repave the trench.

268
00:19:54,577 --> 00:19:58,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I know that Engrid has done more than that.

269
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:02,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Our city standard is going usually one foot beyond the trench.

270
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:10,887
[SPEAKER_05]: And they tend to take a lane because it's another foot, you know, and their trenches and usually straight.

271
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,489
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is it when a private contractor puts a pipe in the street?

272
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:16,229
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to pave the whole street.

273
00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:17,330
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to pave crib to crib.

274
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,290
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a private contractor you're talking about.

275
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,751
[SPEAKER_03]: The rules should be the same for everybody.

276
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:23,211
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree.

277
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:24,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Rules should be the same for everybody.

278
00:20:24,751 --> 00:20:35,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, these companies are coming in, they're destroying our streets, and we get sinkholes, and they come in, they're gone, and six months later, it's all sunk in, they never come back and fix it.

279
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:41,855
[SPEAKER_05]: So they typically do a cold patch, or not cold patch, they do a temporary trench, and then they come back and they do a resurfacing.

280
00:20:42,635 --> 00:20:49,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Typically, six months after they do the work in that six months falls within the winter moratorium, then it goes to the next spring.

281
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:51,300
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been with tomorrow.

282
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:55,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are we digging up during with the moratorium, because it's over 40 degrees and it's warm.

283
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,003
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past, we've never done that before.

284
00:20:57,023 --> 00:21:07,388
[SPEAKER_03]: We've always that you should take that up with the TDW commissioner because I don't think it's right that these these companies to on health to the same standards that the private companies are held so it's not it's just not fair.

285
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:10,900
[SPEAKER_02]: President Bears.

286
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

287
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:20,906
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think what we're hearing is that we all agree that the public utility should be held to a higher standard, but that the state law says that they don't have to be, and we don't control that.

288
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:21,726
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know.

289
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:23,267
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a city project.

290
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:26,069
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Engrid doing their gas main replacement.

291
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:28,490
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know that it's not gonna be in the spring.

292
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,933
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll probably be summer or fall before they come back and do the resurfacing for those roads.

293
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:38,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're very narrow roads, so we'll see how wide those repaving efforts are.

294
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:43,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions, Council night.

295
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:52,745
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I want to talk about in the past I've spoken about with Tim when he was the city engineer was, you know, some sort of mitigation agreement.

296
00:21:53,526 --> 00:21:57,650
[SPEAKER_08]: When these public utilities come to our community and dig up our streets and that.

297
00:21:58,211 --> 00:22:05,762
[SPEAKER_08]: expect to leave their supplies their equipment, their stock on public ways or on public passes.

298
00:22:06,643 --> 00:22:10,749
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's one way I think that we can look at this right if they want to leave the ticket stuff and get it out of here.

299
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:14,357
[SPEAKER_05]: On and grits case.

300
00:22:14,497 --> 00:22:20,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this one has some stuff parked on Thomas, that wasn't the arrangement for that.

301
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:26,206
[SPEAKER_05]: There have been mitigation agreements, especially with the Walnut Street Metcalfe roads.

302
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:28,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's been done in the past we use a spot.

303
00:22:29,168 --> 00:22:40,038
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that that's something that if we look at strengthening those mitigation agreements, I think that might be able to be a way that we can expand that patch on the roadway to maybe go a little bit further than a foot.

304
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:47,825
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we did just receive an updated projected list for the 23 through 26 season of the integrated proposed works.

305
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:56,192
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we will try to pair that up with our own repaving efforts so that we get more utilities in and repaving done.

306
00:22:56,771 --> 00:23:00,217
[SPEAKER_05]: in accordance with this so we can save a little bit of money and stretch our funds.

307
00:23:00,237 --> 00:23:01,158
[SPEAKER_08]: We could post it on the website?

308
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:02,981
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be.

309
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:04,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve Smyrna is on my case about it.

310
00:23:04,844 --> 00:23:05,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

311
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:05,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, excellent.

312
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:06,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

313
00:23:08,938 --> 00:23:10,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for being here.

314
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:23,086
[SPEAKER_07]: The question I have is, as I know in the past before your entry to this wonderful position, we had a question we had with all the road work that's being managed throughout this community.

315
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:31,450
[SPEAKER_07]: How have we set it up that since we don't have a clerk of the works, how do we manage

316
00:23:34,185 --> 00:23:42,752
[SPEAKER_07]: the work of one, let's say, National Grid comes in, sets a trench, leaves, who's monitoring that at the end of the project?

317
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:45,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's typically been the issue, that we just don't have enough people.

318
00:23:46,355 --> 00:23:56,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, and we actually, our DPW staff is really great about reporting issues to us, the whole, and residents too, everyone kind of chips in.

319
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:10,115
[SPEAKER_07]: keeps eyes on things and we tend to find out what's so but we don't have anything formal like in place where it says, you know, we have an alert systems is job, you know, job, job, a from National Grid, public street.

320
00:24:10,435 --> 00:24:19,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, internally, we do track the permits and what's been going on and what is right, you know, been allowed the MSEs is a great way for us to track it internally.

321
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:24,202
[SPEAKER_05]: so that when the springtime happens, we can say, okay, you were- We have to go check it.

322
00:24:24,602 --> 00:24:26,303
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to repave and resurface.

323
00:24:26,503 --> 00:24:26,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

324
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:27,223
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, perfect.

325
00:24:27,303 --> 00:24:27,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

326
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:29,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

327
00:24:29,923 --> 00:24:31,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other discussion from the council?

328
00:24:34,544 --> 00:24:38,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing none, so on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by- So moved.

329
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:40,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

330
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:41,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

331
00:24:41,086 --> 00:24:41,886
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

332
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:42,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

333
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:44,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Owen.

334
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:47,207
[SPEAKER_02]: We are still under suspension.

335
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:48,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to reverse.

336
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:48,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

337
00:24:49,874 --> 00:24:52,461
[SPEAKER_02]: What number is that? 23042.

338
00:24:55,115 --> 00:24:57,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there is.

339
00:24:57,617 --> 00:25:04,102
[SPEAKER_02]: 23042 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council reach out to our federal delegation in regards to the continued problems at the Medford Post Office.

340
00:25:04,162 --> 00:25:04,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello.

341
00:25:05,223 --> 00:25:06,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

342
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:16,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we didn't get something from the Mayor's office today in regards to this, but I'm sure we're all getting the calls from everybody about not getting mail for two or three days.

343
00:25:16,732 --> 00:25:23,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And all I could ask is that this council send something to our federal delegation and that we urge people to

344
00:25:24,138 --> 00:25:31,204
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll call on Catherine Clark, Congressman Clark, Senator Maki, Senator Warren, et cetera.

345
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:34,787
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could send something to my end, I know the mayor has been working on it too.

346
00:25:35,227 --> 00:25:37,009
[SPEAKER_03]: So if that could be done, it'd be appreciated.

347
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:38,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Carmiel.

348
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:44,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, might as well just go with the last two, if we can.

349
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:44,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

350
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:44,575
23040.

351
00:25:44,615 --> 00:25:48,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, Mr. Kasich, do you want to speak on the post office?

352
00:25:51,703 --> 00:25:53,104
[SPEAKER_14]: This is my last one, I'm going home.

353
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:54,986
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you online.

354
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:57,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably.

355
00:25:58,569 --> 00:25:59,270
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the subject?

356
00:25:59,290 --> 00:25:59,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Remind me.

357
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:02,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Post office.

358
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:03,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor.

359
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:08,499
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say factually, my wife has a habit.

360
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:20,019
[SPEAKER_14]: of sending birthday cards and Easter cards and Hanukkah cards and things of that nature to friends and associates.

361
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:22,600
[SPEAKER_14]: And she usually slips in a couple of scratch tickets.

362
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:26,602
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you probably know where I'm going.

363
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:28,103
[SPEAKER_14]: This has been going on a few years.

364
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:32,266
[SPEAKER_14]: She asked her friends, did you get my card?

365
00:26:32,846 --> 00:26:34,347
[SPEAKER_14]: The answer is no, no.

366
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:38,889
[SPEAKER_14]: So I find it very disconcerting that

367
00:26:40,459 --> 00:26:47,583
[SPEAKER_14]: When I was a kid, it was said that the meal must go through a range, so no sleep, shine.

368
00:26:48,544 --> 00:26:58,430
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hate to think that something nefarious is going on in the postal office, but that's lousy.

369
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:03,208
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure there's some other stuff.

370
00:27:03,728 --> 00:27:16,033
[SPEAKER_14]: As you know, in Melrose, the lady, I think we call her a lady, post office gal, was robbed at knife point by two hoodlums.

371
00:27:17,274 --> 00:27:26,458
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess what they wanted was, I didn't think she was carrying a 24-carat gold bullion, and she wasn't, but they wanted the key.

372
00:27:27,797 --> 00:27:30,359
[SPEAKER_14]: the key to the city post office boxes.

373
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:42,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I'm not sure when that happens, if the post office general immediately changes the locks and issues new keys at that instant.

374
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:49,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Because in the old days, people would fish them out with chewing gum in a fishing rod, but they made them mailboxes.

375
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,462
[SPEAKER_14]: So I kind of put a decent package in there.

376
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:56,626
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to go to the post office physically to bring it in.

377
00:27:57,026 --> 00:28:06,294
[SPEAKER_14]: So now when she tells me to mail these cards with scratch stickers in them, I go in the post office and put it into the slit where the sack is.

378
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:09,837
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm not sure if that even works.

379
00:28:11,152 --> 00:28:11,993
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of sad.

380
00:28:13,174 --> 00:28:16,677
[SPEAKER_14]: The state of the country, the state of some peoples, it's just not right.

381
00:28:17,318 --> 00:28:19,039
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope they can do something about this.

382
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe put a tracker or some sort of technology chip or something.

383
00:28:24,164 --> 00:28:25,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Find out what's going on.

384
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:27,747
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for listening.

385
00:28:28,648 --> 00:28:29,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

386
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:36,075
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

387
00:28:36,893 --> 00:28:49,463
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed motion passes, going up to 23-040 offered by Councilor Caraviello be resolved the Metro City Council request that the Recreation Department look into putting a port-a-potty at the pickleball courts at Duggar Park, Councilor Caraviello.

388
00:28:49,483 --> 00:28:50,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

389
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:55,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if anybody has been driving around the city in the morning lately.

390
00:28:58,257 --> 00:29:06,279
[SPEAKER_03]: We run between nine and 11, probably 50, 60 cars of people playing pickleball, which is just growing in leaps and bounds.

391
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:17,701
[SPEAKER_03]: They've reached out to me, all the people that are playing there, senior citizens, and they're asking if they could be a part of a portal party there for them.

392
00:29:17,781 --> 00:29:26,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we could ask that the recreation department look into putting a portal party somewhere over there for them, it would be greatly appreciated.

393
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:28,485
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

394
00:29:28,665 --> 00:29:32,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I completely understand what you're asking for as a member of.

395
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:42,915
[SPEAKER_07]: In our business, in the recreation business, when we're asking for what applies, it sounds great, but because of the pending snow and- And the spring.

396
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:43,815
[SPEAKER_07]: And the issues.

397
00:29:43,895 --> 00:29:46,036
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not looking right this second.

398
00:29:46,056 --> 00:29:47,917
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a confusion, so I think that, yeah.

399
00:29:47,977 --> 00:29:52,518
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think that anywhere there are parks, I think that I would second that.

400
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:59,240
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, once we have, you know, during the spring season where we have the traffic that we have now at

401
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:01,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Doug a park.

402
00:30:02,022 --> 00:30:03,223
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's important that we do.

403
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:11,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, like you said, as you know, a lot of them seniors are there and they have a different needs than that.

404
00:30:11,297 --> 00:30:11,277
1000%.

405
00:30:11,317 --> 00:30:11,938
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

406
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:15,423
[SPEAKER_03]: So I second the motion in further discussion.

407
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:19,588
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

408
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:20,208
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

409
00:30:20,228 --> 00:30:20,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

410
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:21,429
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

411
00:30:21,489 --> 00:30:23,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

412
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,170
[SPEAKER_02]: 23-041, offered by Councilor Caraviello.

413
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:30,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that DPW place a rubbish receptacle in front of the St.

414
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:30,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Joseph's School.

415
00:30:30,772 --> 00:30:32,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello.

416
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:34,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

417
00:30:34,854 --> 00:30:36,655
[SPEAKER_03]: The principal from St.

418
00:30:36,695 --> 00:30:40,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Joseph's has reached out to me and asked about putting a rubbish barrel in front of the school door.

419
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:44,578
[SPEAKER_03]: They've asked in the past, but they've never thought of one.

420
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,861
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not even, they said they will maintain it themselves.

421
00:30:49,301 --> 00:30:51,382
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll have their janitor empty the barrel.

422
00:30:51,402 --> 00:30:57,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can get one of those wireline barrels put there, because people at the bus stop are just leaving stuff there and kids are going swimming and stuff.

423
00:30:58,325 --> 00:31:04,088
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, if they can put a barrel there, the janitorial staff at St.

424
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Joseph's will empty it themselves.

425
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:08,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

426
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:11,691
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

427
00:31:11,711 --> 00:31:12,392
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

428
00:31:13,172 --> 00:31:13,952
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

429
00:31:14,012 --> 00:31:14,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

430
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:18,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we taking every resolution that's not an ordinance?

431
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want to go back to the front now?

432
00:31:21,452 --> 00:31:25,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one from you, Vice President Bears, about the 23-037 we haven't taken.

433
00:31:27,578 --> 00:31:29,039
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine, you want to take it or it's fine?

434
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, good point.

435
00:31:32,883 --> 00:31:38,668
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Vice President Bears to revert to the regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

436
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:39,749
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

437
00:31:39,769 --> 00:31:40,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

438
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:56,751
[SPEAKER_02]: 23-037 offered by vice president bears it resolved by the city council that the city administration take the following steps relative to the city budget to ensure transparency accuracy of information and reporting, and that all boards and commissions have the budget information they need to function.

439
00:31:57,592 --> 00:32:02,817
[SPEAKER_02]: One that the city of administration produce a 2023 budget book and clear go before the budget hearing start.

440
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:07,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, that all commissions have binders as part of the budget book.

441
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:11,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Three, that the city administration reinstate annual reports to be published at the beginning of each calendar year.

442
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:18,912
[SPEAKER_02]: This will help the city prepare in advance for the budget process while providing a valuable source of transparent information about the city's budget activities.

443
00:32:19,852 --> 00:32:21,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Four, develop a one-sheet on financial processes.

444
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:37,784
[SPEAKER_02]: policies budgeting for boards and commissions and share with all members of boards and commissions via further resolve at the subcommittee on ordinances and rules incorporate these recommendations and or any responses from state administration into the draft budget needs assessment ordinance currently being worked on by the subcommittee vice president bears.

445
00:32:37,945 --> 00:32:39,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Madam President.

446
00:32:40,607 --> 00:32:41,548
[SPEAKER_04]: As folks know,

447
00:32:42,147 --> 00:32:44,870
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had a fiscal 23 budget last year.

448
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:52,657
[SPEAKER_04]: The process was less than ideal to be kind to the process, and there have been ongoing issues with us getting the information that we need.

449
00:32:53,158 --> 00:33:01,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Since then, it's also come to my attention from members of various boards and commissions in the city that they don't feel that they have the information that they need around their budgets.

450
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:11,284
[SPEAKER_04]: and that they have some concerns around what has happened to funding that they had and grant funding that has come in and things of that nature.

451
00:33:11,304 --> 00:33:18,007
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't get more specific on that right now, but suffice it to say that boards and commissions

452
00:33:20,453 --> 00:33:21,914
[SPEAKER_04]: have serious concerns about the budget.

453
00:33:21,954 --> 00:33:41,383
[SPEAKER_04]: So these recommendations are to request that the city administration adjust their procedures and processes around the budget and finance and financial information to better inform boards and commissions of the status of their finances and in general to better inform the council and residents about the city budget, where we stand

454
00:33:42,644 --> 00:33:47,508
[SPEAKER_04]: mid-year and getting that process going earlier and making sure everyone has the information they need.

455
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:51,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would ask my colleagues to move approval.

456
00:33:52,252 --> 00:33:53,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Bears.

457
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:54,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

458
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:56,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpellilli.

459
00:33:56,175 --> 00:34:03,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank Vice President Bears for bringing this forward, but this is common practice in most municipal budgets.

460
00:34:05,383 --> 00:34:10,848
[SPEAKER_07]: We're further along in our budget where I'm working with municipal government that I work for, and it's very transparent.

461
00:34:11,882 --> 00:34:23,430
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where I find my frustration that what Councilor Bears just asked for is truly a press of a button of spreadsheets and really help everybody involved.

462
00:34:24,091 --> 00:34:29,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, that magic word of transparency, we use it, but I think we should follow it.

463
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:35,039
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's important that this initiative moves forward.

464
00:34:35,059 --> 00:34:41,023
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate the efforts Vice President Bears and I move second on this paper, thank you.

465
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:41,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

466
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

467
00:34:42,134 --> 00:34:42,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

468
00:34:42,554 --> 00:34:42,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

469
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:44,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

470
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:08,153
[SPEAKER_13]: they want to get more involved in municipal politics.

471
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:16,716
[SPEAKER_13]: And oftentimes it can be really challenging to follow what's going on, especially when things are messy here at City Hall.

472
00:35:16,776 --> 00:35:31,481
[SPEAKER_13]: And so if we take the initiative, if we get ahead of this before the fiscal 24 budget season, then hopefully this helps people at home watching follow municipal politics even better.

473
00:35:32,582 --> 00:35:33,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

474
00:35:33,303 --> 00:35:34,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

475
00:35:35,104 --> 00:35:35,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

476
00:35:36,144 --> 00:35:41,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, I just think it's important to point out that every action has a reaction, right?

477
00:35:41,989 --> 00:35:49,173
[SPEAKER_08]: And this whole process could be avoided if the mayor would just work with the council.

478
00:35:50,655 --> 00:35:58,140
[SPEAKER_08]: We wouldn't have to go through the process of creating legislation to direct the mayor to be transparent if she would work with the council and be a partner to the council.

479
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:00,962
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know,

480
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:13,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine that we've gotten to the point where the council now has to rise to take legislative action to get the man to communicate us to communicate with us effectively when it comes down to the finances of this community.

481
00:36:13,814 --> 00:36:16,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think that's where we are right now.

482
00:36:16,555 --> 00:36:18,795
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how far this relationship is deteriorated.

483
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:21,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I've been in the city my whole life.

484
00:36:22,037 --> 00:36:24,818
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we've all heard the stories about what the council used to be like.

485
00:36:25,704 --> 00:36:30,267
[SPEAKER_08]: when there was fighting and screaming and yelling across the pit, everybody couldn't get along.

486
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:32,129
[SPEAKER_08]: We get along relatively well here.

487
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:39,354
[SPEAKER_08]: This is probably the first time in 40 years that the council actually walks in unison on a lot of items.

488
00:36:39,954 --> 00:36:41,456
[SPEAKER_08]: More often than not, we're in agreement.

489
00:36:42,016 --> 00:36:47,480
[SPEAKER_08]: And the one thing that we all agree on quite frequently is the lack of financial transparency in this community.

490
00:36:48,721 --> 00:36:53,885
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just think it's important to point out that the reason why the council has taken these steps

491
00:36:55,022 --> 00:37:00,265
[SPEAKER_08]: is because the council isn't being provided with the tools or the opportunity to be successful in their job.

492
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:02,486
[SPEAKER_08]: So we need to pass ordinances.

493
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:05,788
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to make laws telling the mayor to communicate with us.

494
00:37:06,568 --> 00:37:07,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about that.

495
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,309
[SPEAKER_08]: How outrageous that is.

496
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:11,150
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where we've, that's what we've come to.

497
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:13,371
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where the relationship has deteriorated to.

498
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:19,354
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the level of respect that the coroner's office gives this body that's been elected by the residents of this community.

499
00:37:19,795 --> 00:37:22,276
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thank Councilor Bears for taking a proactive approach.

500
00:37:23,512 --> 00:37:24,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

501
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:24,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Bears.

502
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:25,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

503
00:37:26,153 --> 00:37:27,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to my colleagues.

504
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:32,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Just if I could make one amendment and strike a 2023 and put FY24.

505
00:37:32,134 --> 00:37:33,634
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just an error on my part.

506
00:37:35,494 --> 00:37:36,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion?

507
00:37:37,935 --> 00:37:42,516
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears, as amended by Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

508
00:37:42,916 --> 00:37:43,596
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

509
00:37:43,616 --> 00:37:44,076
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

510
00:37:44,476 --> 00:37:45,256
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

511
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:46,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

512
00:37:46,137 --> 00:37:51,098
[SPEAKER_02]: 22-058 offered by Vice President Bears and Councilor Collins.

513
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:52,758
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read this whole thing.

514
00:37:57,339 --> 00:37:58,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

515
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:16,703
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the marijuana ordinance 71 pages being read so I don't know what the motion to suspend the reading in favor of a summary on the motion advice was embarrassed to suspend the reading in favor of a summary I will go to Councilor Collins has been working steadfast on this for a summary to be provided to the council.

516
00:38:17,667 --> 00:38:24,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you President Earl I'd be happy to provide a summary of this ordinance and a summary of the process that has gotten us to where we are today.

517
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:37,437
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very gratified to be able to put this ordinance forward for first reading the council has been discussing modifying and evolving this ordinance for almost a full year, almost a full year now in the public health and community safety subcommittee and committee of the whole.

518
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:44,791
[SPEAKER_10]: and in one-on-one conversations with city administration, our chief of police, and other department heads, legal experts, and with community advocates.

519
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:55,817
[SPEAKER_10]: This ordinance is about being proactive to safeguard our community against nascent, privately developed surveillance technologies, which are both rapidly evolving and severely underregulated at the state and federal levels.

520
00:38:56,918 --> 00:39:00,480
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is a very exciting moment for this council and for the city.

521
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:08,463
[SPEAKER_10]: While we would be far from the first city to have a CCOPS ordinance, Medford has the chance to be a real leader here and a model for other communities.

522
00:39:09,123 --> 00:39:20,048
[SPEAKER_10]: This ordinance, with the inclusion of some floor amendments that I'm going to propose in a minute, presents a clear and a structured way for the community, the City Council, and the administration to communicate and to collaborate.

523
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:23,049
[SPEAKER_10]: The outcome of that communication and collaboration

524
00:39:24,022 --> 00:39:31,888
[SPEAKER_10]: will be the development of use policies and parameters for surveillance technologies now and in the future that are properly weighed benefits and the risks of these technologies.

525
00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:39,174
[SPEAKER_10]: When we do choose to put surveillance technology to use in our city, we will know that we have had the intentional conversations about costs and benefits.

526
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:49,101
[SPEAKER_10]: We will have discussed the potential risks and the helpful benefits and how to balance both so as to safeguard community members against threats to personal privacy, civil liberty, and over-surveillance.

527
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:58,585
[SPEAKER_10]: As a city council, we will know that we have a guaranteed seat at the table when potentially large impacts to our constituents' lives and potentially huge purchases are decided.

528
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:05,847
[SPEAKER_10]: We will have a clear and a structured way to let this people's forum be a people's forum on these very real 21st century issues.

529
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:10,108
[SPEAKER_10]: And we will be able to guarantee that our constituents have a chance to ask questions and to be heard.

530
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:14,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Surveillance technology is already in use in communities around America.

531
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,471
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no turning back the clock on this new class of corporate technology.

532
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:17,831
[SPEAKER_10]: However,

533
00:40:18,512 --> 00:40:26,876
[SPEAKER_10]: We can do what we can under our local purview to take this as an opportunity to involve the public to hear from experts and to build trust between our government and our community.

534
00:40:27,797 --> 00:40:37,662
[SPEAKER_10]: So the version of the ordinance that we'll be voting on tonight is the product of four years of advocacy by the community coalition behind it, and months of discussion among city council and the administration.

535
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:43,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Since March of last year we have substantially modified added to and subtracted from the original draft.

536
00:40:43,985 --> 00:41:00,195
[SPEAKER_10]: These changes centered around paring down the reporting requirements to make this ordinance more manageable, making it more clear that routine office tools are not considered surveillance technology, and also clarifying the reporting requirements are to be high level and general rather than onerous and granular.

537
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:17,122
[SPEAKER_10]: Throughout this process we have had productive good faith conversations with this administration, especially this chief of police in those conversations we've been able to address a number of outstanding concerns that were raised even after this ordinance was reported at committee, and I know that no document is perfect.

538
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:24,720
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are partners within and without of this administration, who have, who would have preferred different approaches to certain aspects of this ordinance.

539
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:34,146
[SPEAKER_10]: Still I'm grateful that we seem to have reached an agreement across a broad range of stakeholders on a set of amendments that we believe would make this ordinance doable workable for this community.

540
00:41:35,307 --> 00:41:40,610
[SPEAKER_10]: And there is a document before Councilors, along with the clean and also redlined versions of the

541
00:41:41,503 --> 00:41:49,167
[SPEAKER_10]: ordinance tonight, outlining the floor amendments that we intend to propose, and I will move that they be adopted prior to us taking a vote tonight.

542
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:58,793
[SPEAKER_10]: So, to sum up, I believe this has been a collaborative process helping us craft what I think is the most Medford tailored version of this ordinance that we could have arrived at.

543
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:11,921
[SPEAKER_10]: In short, this ordinance would advance the goals of transparency, accountability, community participation, and trust building, goals that we all share, within a scope that our department heads can accomplish within their existing duties.

544
00:42:12,842 --> 00:42:16,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank my fellow Councilors for their deference with my preamble.

545
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,063
[SPEAKER_10]: and I ask for your support tonight.

546
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:27,638
[SPEAKER_10]: And President Morell, I know that there are audience members here to speak on the ordinance, and I would ask if you'd be willing to invite them up to speak after my co-sponsor.

547
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:28,299
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

548
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:29,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

549
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:30,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Vices and bears.

550
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

551
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:42,954
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I just want to thank Councilor Collins for her incredible leadership over the past 14 or so months to advance the ball on this ordinance.

552
00:42:43,014 --> 00:42:59,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also want to thank Medford People Power and all of the organizations and individuals who came together to initiate this process, move it forward, have many, many community meetings and forums and discussions and conversations about getting it to where we are tonight.

553
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:21,274
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also want to acknowledge and thank the city administration and Chief Buckley for the many conversations that we've had to get to a place where we feel that this is something that we can enact, given the capacity of city staff and to address outstanding concerns.

554
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:23,515
[SPEAKER_04]: I also want to say that

555
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:38,051
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, one of the things that we talk about in government is when, you know, when you're trying to reach a compromise between parties who have different positions on issues, usually the end result is something that nobody is 100% ecstatic about.

556
00:43:38,071 --> 00:43:44,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this, after we put the amendments forward tonight, I think that this document will reflect that as well.

557
00:43:44,977 --> 00:43:46,758
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say that because

558
00:43:47,859 --> 00:44:03,171
[SPEAKER_04]: it's reaching an agreement between their stakeholders, again, with different approaches and thoughts around how this should be enacted, but also that as we move forward through this process, the intent of the ordinance is that it be long lasting and also that it adapt to change.

559
00:44:04,352 --> 00:44:14,440
[SPEAKER_04]: And as the council considers surveillance reports for the first time, as the community adapts to changes in technology and

560
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:19,469
[SPEAKER_04]: all of the different things that come around them rapidly changing and growing.

561
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:26,067
[SPEAKER_04]: and surveillance technology environment across the world.

562
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:30,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to have to come back and look at pieces of this, you know, in the future.

563
00:44:30,188 --> 00:44:32,089
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to put that out there, too.

564
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:46,134
[SPEAKER_04]: And the great thing about this is that I really think it creates a strong foundation for us to have those conversations, to build trust and understanding in what the city is doing around these technologies that are

565
00:44:47,158 --> 00:44:56,964
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in many cases, new and unknown and have impacts and consequences that can't be foreseen.

566
00:44:57,184 --> 00:45:12,513
[SPEAKER_04]: So that creating of a community process and a forum and a place for members of the Medford community to directly discuss what their local government is going to be doing when it comes to surveillance technology, I think is an incredibly important thing for us to do.

567
00:45:12,593 --> 00:45:14,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I completely agree with Councilor Collins.

568
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:33,868
[SPEAKER_04]: that the state and federal governments are not taking the approach they need to take on us, and so it's up to local government to do so, and that local government is generally tends to be the level of government that has the most direct impact, the most direct interaction with people in their everyday lives, and that's the place where

569
00:45:35,005 --> 00:45:42,031
[SPEAKER_04]: In many cases, surveillance could be the most impactful and could have the most negative impacts if not done correctly and not done with community control.

570
00:45:42,391 --> 00:45:46,295
[SPEAKER_04]: So really thankful to Councilor Collins again for your leadership.

571
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:55,182
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may, I'd like to just propose that we amend, propose the 12 following amendments to the ordinance on the agenda.

572
00:45:56,083 --> 00:45:58,685
[SPEAKER_04]: The first would be to strike some language from section 50-70.

573
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:05,773
[SPEAKER_04]: to provide protocols for use of surveillance technology or surveillance data that includes specific steps 2.

574
00:46:06,573 --> 00:46:13,337
[SPEAKER_04]: The second is to strike and remove section 5071 C and D and adopt the updated section numbers.

575
00:46:14,298 --> 00:46:18,180
[SPEAKER_04]: The third is to strike and remove the following language from section 5071 F and 5071 G subsection 3.

576
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:31,045
[SPEAKER_04]: and those language removals would be or significant property damage or loss and will be, and the phrase and will be used only in the surface of code enforcement.

577
00:46:31,065 --> 00:46:45,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to further propose following amendments to adopt amendments, add new subsection to section 50-72, which would be B, body-worn cameras shall be exempt from section 50-72 of this ordinance until January 1st, 2028.

578
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:46,267
[SPEAKER_04]: Add a new subsection.

579
00:46:50,103 --> 00:46:55,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just repeat that I missed that but you said it's going to put off the use of body one police cameras.

580
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:57,791
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's actually going to exempt our approval.

581
00:46:57,811 --> 00:47:05,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Those, if those were to be used by the city they would not have to be approved by the city council for five years until January 1 2028.

582
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:28,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would also add to the section 50-73 the same clause, 50-74 the same clause, technical amendment to 50-74 subsection A to change the language to no later than 90 days following the effective date of this ordinance or prior to implementation of any new surveillance technology use covered by this ordinance.

583
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:34,573
[SPEAKER_04]: strike the first sentence of section 50 77 B and replace it with scope and intentions.

584
00:47:35,013 --> 00:47:49,857
[SPEAKER_04]: The annual surveillance report is to provide a written report on an annual basis that contains a high level and generalized summary of policies and usages concerning surveillance technology used by any city department during the previous year and containing the information set forth in section 50 dash 77 of this ordinance.

585
00:47:51,397 --> 00:47:58,399
[SPEAKER_04]: The eighth amendment is to strike and remove section 50 dash 77 C subsections four, five and nine and update the section numbers.

586
00:47:59,638 --> 00:48:04,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Ninth Amendment is to strike section 50-79B and replace with B cause of action.

587
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:15,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Any violation of this ordinance constitutes an injury and any person may institute proceedings for injunctive relief, declaratory relief or writ of mandate in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce this ordinance.

588
00:48:15,785 --> 00:48:25,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Any actions instituted under this paragraph shall be brought against the city and if necessary to effectuate compliance with this ordinance, any other governmental agency with possession, custody or control of data subject to this ordinance.

589
00:48:27,002 --> 00:48:36,707
[SPEAKER_04]: striking the following sentence from section 59 C and this is due to federal and state Supreme State court rulings that this can't be done by ordinance would be striking the sentence.

590
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:42,950
[SPEAKER_04]: A court shall award costs and reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiff who is the prevailing party in an action brought to enforce this ordinance.

591
00:48:44,317 --> 00:49:06,063
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd also strike in a move section 5080 and update the section numbers to reflect that and finally strike section 5081 and replace it with, quote, it shall be unlawful for the city to enter into any contract for monetary value with a commercial entity that provides the city with a mass acquisition of privately generated and own bulk surveillance data, any contracts or agreements signed prior to the enactment of this ordinance that violate this section shall not be renewed.

592
00:49:06,712 --> 00:49:14,346
[SPEAKER_04]: After the completion of the term of said contracts or agreements, Section 5080 shall not apply to contracts or agreements executed for law enforcement operations or purposes.

593
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:15,968
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are the amendments.

594
00:49:17,271 --> 00:49:18,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Can the clerk read those back, please?

595
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:23,520
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome to.

596
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,560
[SPEAKER_08]: The way I look at this matter.

597
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he has it.

598
00:49:25,861 --> 00:49:26,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I thought you asked.

599
00:49:27,702 --> 00:49:28,122
[SPEAKER_02]: He has it.

600
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,063
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I would not.

601
00:49:29,763 --> 00:49:34,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Because right now I think that what we have in front of us is an 11 page ordinance with 12 amendments, right?

602
00:49:34,646 --> 00:49:35,326
[SPEAKER_08]: This is craziness.

603
00:49:35,526 --> 00:49:35,706
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

604
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:39,308
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't even something that's really important to the operation of our local government, in my opinion.

605
00:49:39,528 --> 00:49:39,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

606
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:46,012
[SPEAKER_08]: We spent a lot of time, energy and effort working on something when I think we could have really been working on something else that matters to more people in this community.

607
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that there's a group of people that care about this.

608
00:49:48,893 --> 00:49:50,353
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not really one of them.

609
00:49:51,174 --> 00:49:55,495
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that this is something that's vital to the future of the city of Medford.

610
00:49:55,835 --> 00:50:03,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite frankly, I think that it does things that can kind of hamstrung our ability to move forward and to promote a vision that adopts technology.

611
00:50:04,018 --> 00:50:08,079
[SPEAKER_08]: When we sit down, when we first started talking about this ordinance, chat GPT wasn't a thing.

612
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:10,280
[SPEAKER_08]: And now look what it is, right?

613
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So in a very short period of time, technology has changed.

614
00:50:13,782 --> 00:50:18,484
[SPEAKER_08]: And quite frankly, when we codify something in an ordinance, the government process is designed to move slow.

615
00:50:19,245 --> 00:50:24,988
[SPEAKER_08]: And by codifying this in ordinance, I think what it's going to do is hamstring us in our ability to adapt the technology.

616
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:27,929
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really not something that I want to support this evening.

617
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:34,933
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think when we're looking at the direction that we're going in here in the community, you know,

618
00:50:36,204 --> 00:50:45,192
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working on a lot of things, but the results that the people want to see that I talk to are in the streets.

619
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:50,228
[SPEAKER_08]: They're on the ground, they're on the sidewalks, they're in the delivery of services.

620
00:50:51,388 --> 00:50:54,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So while I can appreciate the work that's gone into this, it's not gonna be able to support this evening.

621
00:50:55,209 --> 00:51:07,171
[SPEAKER_08]: And I asked my council colleagues to really think long and hard about an 11 page ordinance with 12 amendments on the floor, and whether or not that's a good transparent public process for us to take hold of and move on.

622
00:51:07,511 --> 00:51:12,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that the gentleman put a lot of work into it, as well as the lady, my colleague said I did an excellent job on this ordinance, don't get me wrong.

623
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:14,792
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just something that I have problems with,

624
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:17,649
[SPEAKER_08]: theoretically.

625
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,311
[SPEAKER_08]: So for those reasons, I will be supporting the paper this evening.

626
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:25,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

627
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:25,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

628
00:51:26,014 --> 00:51:28,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Collins, Councilor Villes.

629
00:51:28,935 --> 00:51:32,817
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this took a lot of time, but I've been steadfast in my

630
00:51:35,152 --> 00:51:42,854
[SPEAKER_07]: my view of our business and the lack of legal representation that could guide this council.

631
00:51:43,515 --> 00:51:49,716
[SPEAKER_07]: And without that, that's one of the many reasons why I can't support this this evening.

632
00:51:49,736 --> 00:52:00,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Councilor Knight said, there are 12 amendments of an ordinance that needs to be changed and how that affects the technology piece, not just this situation, but moving forward in other situations.

633
00:52:02,897 --> 00:52:08,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I'm gonna say this again, Councilor Knight put it one way, I'll put it the way that I've been saying it.

634
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:18,782
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been trying to do the city's business without a city attorney that represents this council, that guides us on ordinances.

635
00:52:19,922 --> 00:52:27,245
[SPEAKER_07]: The recommendations from KP Law, I don't even know if they would be valid for the fact that they don't work for this council.

636
00:52:28,193 --> 00:52:38,586
[SPEAKER_07]: So any legal information that we need to back from dealing with the legality of this or any of the questions that we had.

637
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:50,105
[SPEAKER_07]: I really can't trust or depend on, and to support this right now would be no different than any of the other papers that I've not voted for because of the lack of legal guidance.

638
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:52,486
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope you can understand that.

639
00:52:52,506 --> 00:52:53,687
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate the hard work.

640
00:52:53,727 --> 00:52:57,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that this took a lot of work, and I appreciate that.

641
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:58,310
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

642
00:52:58,930 --> 00:52:59,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

643
00:53:00,772 --> 00:53:01,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins.

644
00:53:02,437 --> 00:53:11,439
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Morell, and I appreciate my colleagues thoughtful consideration of what's before us this evening, not just a 12 page ordinance, but also 12 floor amendments to go with it.

645
00:53:11,459 --> 00:53:15,960
[SPEAKER_10]: And Councilor Scarpelli, to your point, I honestly, I do hear you on the legal council piece.

646
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:27,182
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that that is a concern that this entire body shares, and I'm sympathetic to your view that, you know, at some point we have to draw the line when it comes to demanding appropriate legal representation for this council.

647
00:53:27,262 --> 00:53:29,142
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, I've made this clear many times

648
00:53:30,577 --> 00:53:32,738
[SPEAKER_10]: to me, serving in public office is a privilege.

649
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:39,262
[SPEAKER_10]: None of us know how long we're going to get to sit in this chair and I'm committed to doing what I can while I can for a lot for as long as I sit in this chair.

650
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:45,747
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I hear about an ordinance that a community group has been pushing for for four years, if I have the opportunity to work on it, I'm going to work on it.

651
00:53:46,187 --> 00:53:48,028
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my personal opinion and I respect yours.

652
00:53:48,668 --> 00:53:49,649
[SPEAKER_10]: On the issue of the 12-4 amendments,

653
00:53:52,173 --> 00:54:01,922
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think this is something that is procedurally well within bounds so there are other comments that I've heard that I don't quite know how to countenance but if any of my fellow Councilors would like us to go more in depth on what's before us.

654
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:07,267
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we did kind of a speed read round I'd also be very happy to walk anybody through it.

655
00:54:07,848 --> 00:54:11,492
[SPEAKER_10]: I touched on this in my opening remarks but all of these floor amendments have come from.

656
00:54:13,043 --> 00:54:25,595
[SPEAKER_10]: conversations that we have had with the city administration over the past months, in the past two weeks, as recently as today, all in service of trying to pass an ordinance that is manageable and doable for this administration.

657
00:54:26,295 --> 00:54:34,123
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry if that process didn't feel transparent at first blush, but there's, you know, all of this in spirit of this ordinance can be talked through.

658
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:34,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

659
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:36,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information if I can.

660
00:54:36,383 --> 00:54:36,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Scarpelli.

661
00:54:37,124 --> 00:54:50,687
[SPEAKER_07]: In no time do I question your ability or I'm disrespecting you in any way, madam, my fellow council, but like I said, and the other votes we've taken, we've talked about this and I've been steadfast on this.

662
00:54:52,107 --> 00:55:03,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Even with the knowledge of the city administration or the knowledge of outside parties or your intense work, I still, still doing the city's work and making sure

663
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:08,413
[SPEAKER_07]: that anything I vote on, I feel secure legally that I've done the right thing.

664
00:55:09,013 --> 00:55:11,235
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I bring this back all the way back to BJ's.

665
00:55:12,216 --> 00:55:16,539
[SPEAKER_07]: We voted on something that we thought was right because the work of this council, we thought we put in how we felt.

666
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,061
[SPEAKER_07]: It came back and we were sued and we lost.

667
00:55:19,862 --> 00:55:26,227
[SPEAKER_07]: And we lost money tenfold, whether it be attorneys fighting the fight or fighting the appeal or whatnot.

668
00:55:26,747 --> 00:55:29,529
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that that's my point.

669
00:55:29,709 --> 00:55:30,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing else right now.

670
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that this is the reason why

671
00:55:34,148 --> 00:55:40,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that this is the frustration that Councilor Knight brought up when it came to Councilor Beza's last paper.

672
00:55:40,774 --> 00:55:47,721
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about the partnership with the mayor's office and this council working together.

673
00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:56,850
[SPEAKER_07]: In other municipalities, there is a liaison that works directly with the mayor's office that works as a partner with us.

674
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:17,325
[SPEAKER_07]: When we had some issues and concerns and negativity going back from this office, I sat with the chief of staff, I sat with the mayor, and I said, please, allow us to share in the celebrations, but as equal share in the negative issues that are happening, that we can work together.

675
00:56:17,945 --> 00:56:19,085
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's just not happening.

676
00:56:19,945 --> 00:56:22,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And until it starts to hurt,

677
00:56:23,863 --> 00:56:26,284
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not, I haven't voted for a money paper.

678
00:56:26,744 --> 00:56:28,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not vote for money paper.

679
00:56:28,565 --> 00:56:36,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the city administration has to understand either we start getting along, we start fulfilling the needs that we need as a council that we've asked for for years.

680
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:38,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't support it.

681
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:40,652
[SPEAKER_07]: It has nothing to do with, I appreciate what you're doing.

682
00:56:40,672 --> 00:56:42,492
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate your knowledge and the time you put into it.

683
00:56:42,813 --> 00:56:46,815
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, no disrespect, but you're not an attorney.

684
00:56:47,825 --> 00:57:06,218
[SPEAKER_07]: the people in that office I'm working for this, this, this office, this, this department, and we don't have anybody that's that's guiding us, because I will tell you, I did contact city solicitors that I used to work with, and they, they recommended that George you don't, you shouldn't do anything until you get a representation from your city solicitor because

685
00:57:07,448 --> 00:57:09,250
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't know, they've never heard this before.

686
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:17,257
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no definition of who is guiding us in signing any ordinance, let alone this ordinance, but any ordinance moving forward.

687
00:57:17,918 --> 00:57:22,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it's coming from, you know, support and who's guiding us, who's pushing this forward.

688
00:57:23,182 --> 00:57:27,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I'm cognizant and a little leery of anything we do.

689
00:57:28,007 --> 00:57:31,030
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that I've talked to Councilor Biaz, I've talked to Councilor Morell about this.

690
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:32,971
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we have to do the city's work.

691
00:57:33,732 --> 00:57:40,574
[SPEAKER_07]: But there are some things we just can't, can't push forward without having what I feel comfortable for the constituents that put me here.

692
00:57:40,594 --> 00:57:45,755
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate it and I apologize, but I thank you for respecting both of our opinions.

693
00:57:45,815 --> 00:57:45,975
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

694
00:57:48,516 --> 00:57:50,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion from the council at this time?

695
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:52,737
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello.

696
00:57:53,317 --> 00:57:54,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

697
00:57:55,518 --> 00:57:56,658
[SPEAKER_03]: These amendments are dated today.

698
00:57:56,678 --> 00:57:58,318
[SPEAKER_03]: When were these amendments drawn up?

699
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a date of today on it.

700
00:58:01,819 --> 00:58:02,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?

701
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,061
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the date of today.

702
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:04,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question.

703
00:58:05,262 --> 00:58:06,182
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a member of the committee.

704
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:08,644
[SPEAKER_03]: How come I wasn't consulted in any of these?

705
00:58:10,165 --> 00:58:13,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this was reported out of committee and then reported out of committee of the whole.

706
00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:16,890
[SPEAKER_02]: These are from, these were reported out, these are the amendments.

707
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:18,532
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, these are.

708
00:58:18,792 --> 00:58:26,077
[SPEAKER_10]: No, these are, these are, sorry, Councilor Caraviello, these are new amendments that we're proposing after it was reported out of committee of the whole.

709
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,579
[SPEAKER_03]: fellow members of this committee and I was a consultant on this.

710
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are amendments being presented by vice-president Bears.

711
00:58:35,442 --> 00:58:54,113
[SPEAKER_04]: These are amendments that I just proposed them, but that councilor Collins and I, as the people who filed the paper, we met in negotiations with the mayor and the chief to develop a list of further amendments after the paper had been reported out of both the subcommittee and the committee of the whole.

712
00:58:54,393 --> 00:58:58,816
[SPEAKER_03]: So why wouldn't the subcommittee admit again to discuss these amendments?

713
00:58:58,996 --> 00:59:00,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the paper had already been reported out.

714
00:59:04,128 --> 00:59:05,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion from the councilor?

715
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:05,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng?

716
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:21,141
[SPEAKER_13]: I have some notes written, but I would actually, if my councilors are amenable, I'd like to listen to some residents who are here for this topic.

717
00:59:22,162 --> 00:59:23,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other council discussion at this time?

718
00:59:23,783 --> 00:59:25,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam Mayor, I think we all know where we stand on this.

719
00:59:25,224 --> 00:59:25,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we just take a vote?

720
00:59:26,645 --> 00:59:30,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think we, there's a number of residents here to speak, and I think we'd like to hear from them.

721
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,109
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm happy to.

722
00:59:33,065 --> 00:59:33,766
[SPEAKER_02]: have folks come up.

723
00:59:33,906 --> 00:59:34,866
[SPEAKER_06]: The chief is here as well.

724
00:59:34,926 --> 00:59:41,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, yeah, Chief Buckley, if you'd like to speak first, or... I mean, you are more than welcome to speak first.

725
00:59:42,272 --> 00:59:43,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we'll hear from the members of the public.

726
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:53,060
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

727
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:55,962
[SPEAKER_15]: I always do.

728
00:59:56,922 --> 00:59:57,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Happy Valentine's Day.

729
00:59:57,782 --> 01:00:00,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for letting me come before you to speak for this.

730
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:04,646
[SPEAKER_15]: I myself have been involved in these negotiations for four years now.

731
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:06,106
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we started 2019 and

732
01:00:09,646 --> 01:00:16,651
[SPEAKER_15]: recognized from very early on that this is a difficult ordinance for not just the city but for the police department.

733
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:18,612
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of this pertains to the police department.

734
01:00:19,652 --> 01:00:33,321
[SPEAKER_15]: As the negotiations have developed throughout the years and more specifically this past year, the ordinance took on some heft and involved a lot of items that very clearly I could not produce for this city.

735
01:00:34,042 --> 01:00:34,582
[SPEAKER_15]: And

736
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:43,054
[SPEAKER_15]: I can, by way of example, I can tell you that I'm a strong proponent of police officers wearing body-worn cameras.

737
01:00:43,554 --> 01:00:44,895
[SPEAKER_15]: My unions are in support of it.

738
01:00:44,935 --> 01:00:46,276
[SPEAKER_15]: The police department is in support of it.

739
01:00:46,616 --> 01:00:49,078
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a piece of technology that I have

740
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:53,745
[SPEAKER_15]: very early on identified as wanting to be exempt from this policy.

741
01:00:53,945 --> 01:01:10,412
[SPEAKER_15]: And as the sort of debate around this CCOPS ordinance developed, it became clear that it would be impossible for me to implement a body-worn camera policy if the ordinance was to be voted in the way it was written.

742
01:01:11,072 --> 01:01:14,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Very recently, and again, I understand where I stand

743
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:18,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Vote wise and politically wise where this is.

744
01:01:18,981 --> 01:01:35,851
[SPEAKER_15]: I am negotiating from the position of weakness You know The the C cops C cops ordinance in itself The irony of the name and so I know we can go back and forth to call it, you know community control the public surveillance Police surveillance.

745
01:01:35,891 --> 01:01:37,492
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what everybody is put the floor.

746
01:01:37,532 --> 01:01:41,815
[SPEAKER_15]: It's why it being an acronym is C cops Is

747
01:01:43,777 --> 01:01:58,202
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just it's a way of looking at police in a negative light and I believe in my profession and I believe in our police department and I believe in the officers that go out there and I believe that they do a very difficult job and they do it very well and that

748
01:01:58,642 --> 01:02:02,924
[SPEAKER_15]: Legislating how they should behave is probably not necessarily the right thing to do.

749
01:02:02,944 --> 01:02:07,666
[SPEAKER_15]: We should be supporting them, training them, holding them accountable, and all for that.

750
01:02:08,566 --> 01:02:20,471
[SPEAKER_15]: So as we move forward with this, in the last few days, there's been conversations about modifying the ordinance to address some of the concerns that I have had.

751
01:02:21,191 --> 01:02:26,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I'm telling you, last week, if the ordinance passed, I would not have a body-worn camera policy.

752
01:02:26,554 --> 01:02:27,314
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've got to tell you.

753
01:02:29,932 --> 01:02:33,933
[SPEAKER_15]: God forbid anything had happened, it would be on this council that body-worn cameras were not on the street.

754
01:02:34,473 --> 01:02:41,635
[SPEAKER_15]: There's been some amendments that have been put forward that, you know, considering my negotiation position, I have to support, right?

755
01:02:42,095 --> 01:02:48,636
[SPEAKER_15]: I've talked to both councils, and I've said from the beginning, I want body-worn cameras exempt for a lot of reasons.

756
01:02:49,656 --> 01:02:56,238
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a five-year exemption, which will allow me to put body-worn cameras on the street, and it'll probably be as soon as this summer, at least in some sort

757
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:57,420
[SPEAKER_15]: training program.

758
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:05,606
[SPEAKER_15]: So the way the amendments are, I support having amendments to an ordinance that I probably don't totally support.

759
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:10,149
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I always find myself having to qualify and quantify things I say.

760
01:03:10,469 --> 01:03:13,471
[SPEAKER_15]: I support the civil liberties and civil rights of all people.

761
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:18,635
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I took an oath, and I've honored that oath for 25 years.

762
01:03:18,955 --> 01:03:20,536
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not that aspect of the ordinance.

763
01:03:21,037 --> 01:03:22,758
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the burden that it's putting on the police department.

764
01:03:23,142 --> 01:03:23,902
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not Boston.

765
01:03:24,022 --> 01:03:24,743
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not Cambridge.

766
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:25,543
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not Somerville.

767
01:03:25,683 --> 01:03:30,886
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not San Francisco and any of the other major city and municipalities that have this ordinance.

768
01:03:31,346 --> 01:03:32,847
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm down with 20 police officers.

769
01:03:33,387 --> 01:03:36,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Even watered down, this puts a burden on my police department.

770
01:03:36,749 --> 01:03:48,754
[SPEAKER_15]: So I very much appreciate that the amendments are in there and that there was some listening and going back and forth to allow at least me to be able to put a body-worn camera policy in place.

771
01:03:51,457 --> 01:03:55,618
[SPEAKER_15]: sound practice for a manager like myself to sit there and push it down the road for five years?

772
01:03:56,419 --> 01:03:58,179
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think so, but I have to take it, right?

773
01:03:58,479 --> 01:04:01,941
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I have to sort of say, I have to take the five years.

774
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:04,722
[SPEAKER_15]: I want 41 cameras excluded permanently.

775
01:04:04,782 --> 01:04:05,782
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had that discussion.

776
01:04:05,802 --> 01:04:07,743
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think I'm gonna get my way.

777
01:04:11,004 --> 01:04:13,005
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if I'm gonna be here in five years to address it.

778
01:04:13,025 --> 01:04:14,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if I'm gonna be here next week.

779
01:04:14,465 --> 01:04:20,087
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's the way policing goes these days, but it is not sound practice to put

780
01:04:21,438 --> 01:04:27,183
[SPEAKER_15]: managerial practice to put in play body-worn camera policy or any other policy, and then say five years from now, we'll look at it and review it.

781
01:04:28,224 --> 01:04:29,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Thumbs up or thumbs down.

782
01:04:29,805 --> 01:04:34,068
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we should learn a lot of lessons when we put it in the street and keep it in play.

783
01:04:35,289 --> 01:04:38,372
[SPEAKER_15]: So I try not to confuse people.

784
01:04:38,652 --> 01:04:42,175
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, as far as the ordinance goes, I believe in this police department, I do.

785
01:04:42,415 --> 01:04:46,959
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't believe that, you know, we need an ordinance to make us do good police work.

786
01:04:48,611 --> 01:04:53,655
[SPEAKER_15]: I will repeat over and over again that we always uphold civil rights and civil liberties in this police department.

787
01:04:53,695 --> 01:05:00,100
[SPEAKER_15]: We will maintain it when those issues are called into question, we will investigate and we will hold officers accountable when needed be.

788
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:09,968
[SPEAKER_15]: That being said, recognizing that this ordinance is going to pass, the amendments do help me get a body-worn camera program in play.

789
01:05:10,649 --> 01:05:11,049
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I

790
01:05:15,622 --> 01:05:17,824
[SPEAKER_15]: I just it's just a position of weakness that I stand for.

791
01:05:17,884 --> 01:05:22,349
[SPEAKER_15]: So I would prefer to have body one cameras excluded completely.

792
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:26,132
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's probably not proper to be up here negotiating that.

793
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:31,277
[SPEAKER_15]: But the things that were put in place in the past for this ordinance have sort of

794
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:41,177
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, would have put this police department in a very tragic position as it relates to managing a police department and holding them accountable in 2023 and further.

795
01:05:42,018 --> 01:05:43,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Now there's a little bit of light.

796
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:44,500
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like it to go further.

797
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:48,644
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have questions, I'll be able to answer them, but that's where I stand on this, people.

798
01:05:49,284 --> 01:05:50,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Chief.

799
01:05:50,085 --> 01:05:50,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one question.

800
01:05:51,326 --> 01:06:00,934
[SPEAKER_07]: Chief, since your tenure as a chief, have you seen, is there identified issues with what we're talking about that people's civil liberties have been

801
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,671
[SPEAKER_07]: harness harmed.

802
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:07,936
[SPEAKER_15]: So through the use of technology, I don't know of any right now.

803
01:06:07,976 --> 01:06:10,499
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what we're talking about technology and surveillance.

804
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:12,842
[SPEAKER_15]: I've said from the beginning, I don't have much of this.

805
01:06:13,062 --> 01:06:15,104
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not a very wealthy community.

806
01:06:15,264 --> 01:06:19,950
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I have money, I'm going to spend it on human resources, not on surveillance technology.

807
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:21,772
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have a lot of this technology.

808
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:22,873
[SPEAKER_15]: And those that

809
01:06:23,307 --> 01:06:38,458
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we do have, have historically been exempt from, Boston's exempted some of the, like the 911, it is a surveillance piece of equipment, but we haven't received in my tenure, but I can tell you 25 years prior to that, many complaints that I can think of off the top of my head as it relates to that.

810
01:06:38,738 --> 01:06:49,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So two Sundays ago, I was personally involved in a road rage incident where a person, I had my son and another guest in my car,

811
01:06:51,565 --> 01:07:02,550
[SPEAKER_07]: up and down 93, young person driving crazy, slowing down near an exit, threw a bottle off my car, contacted the state police.

812
01:07:04,551 --> 01:07:08,713
[SPEAKER_07]: As we're traversing, they were taking off the exit.

813
01:07:10,074 --> 01:07:12,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Person was making motion that he was gonna shoot me.

814
01:07:13,676 --> 01:07:18,518
[SPEAKER_07]: As we came closer, and we were really slow because they were slowing up going to the exit.

815
01:07:19,875 --> 01:07:27,739
[SPEAKER_07]: That person then slouched down into a seat, and I heard my son scream, dad, he's got a gun.

816
01:07:27,779 --> 01:07:28,880
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked to the state troopers.

817
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,481
[SPEAKER_07]: They ran the numbers.

818
01:07:30,561 --> 01:07:34,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, it wasn't the plate, the number with the car that we set.

819
01:07:36,284 --> 01:07:38,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Got a phone call yesterday from the state police, thankfully.

820
01:07:39,686 --> 01:07:48,931
[SPEAKER_07]: What I expressed that evening was not even that the gun issue, but the fear for my family that if he has my license plate,

821
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:54,274
[SPEAKER_07]: What is he gonna do if he's gonna brandish a gun on the highway?

822
01:07:56,194 --> 01:08:09,959
[SPEAKER_07]: State Trooper called me yesterday, told me thankfully for the surveillance cameras on the Cloverleaf, they identified the car to the plate that we gave, and they followed through.

823
01:08:09,979 --> 01:08:17,602
[SPEAKER_07]: He couldn't give us any more information, but to say that, it's safe to say that

824
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:29,167
[SPEAKER_07]: It's documented, they know it, but there's a history there with that situation.

825
01:08:29,227 --> 01:08:37,853
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can tell you firsthand, I know my son and his friend haven't slept because of that fear.

826
01:08:41,165 --> 01:08:42,185
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to share that with you.

827
01:08:42,445 --> 01:08:51,407
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate how state troopers do their due diligence using that form of policing in a sense that, and it really wasn't used for policing.

828
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:52,908
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really used for traffic.

829
01:08:53,568 --> 01:08:58,909
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you talk about a gun, they really triggered something for them to look at that.

830
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:01,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was history there.

831
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,610
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to share that with you.

832
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:04,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

833
01:09:05,013 --> 01:09:05,353
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

834
01:09:05,633 --> 01:09:09,514
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, you know, like technology is meant to be used for good.

835
01:09:09,614 --> 01:09:15,956
[SPEAKER_15]: And I get it, there are people who can fear for this, but you have to have some faith in your employees and some faith in the people you asked to lead them, right?

836
01:09:16,036 --> 01:09:23,239
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was asked to lead this police department and I believe in controlling how we operate as a police department and for the good.

837
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:34,482
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, even with the amendments, it's a burden on the police department, but I have to say, it's a very, very difficult position to stand here to say,

838
01:09:36,037 --> 01:09:40,665
[SPEAKER_15]: not for the ordinance, but I really need these, like, if you want a body-worn camera, I need this amendments passed.

839
01:09:40,905 --> 01:09:42,267
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's kind of.

840
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:52,302
[SPEAKER_15]: know, uh, difficult, but I would ask that if somebody would reconsider at the last second to exempt 41 cameras forever because I think it's a good technology.

841
01:09:52,342 --> 01:10:06,686
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's going to hold, uh, the city in a better light, and we will never have to answer the questions that they've had to answer in Cambridge and other communities that have not, you know, have impeded the progress of 41 cameras on police.

842
01:10:06,926 --> 01:10:08,327
[SPEAKER_15]: So other questions.

843
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:09,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

844
01:10:11,288 --> 01:10:11,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Morell.

845
01:10:12,827 --> 01:10:14,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you chief appreciate you being up here.

846
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:25,314
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like I said earlier today, I really appreciate your candor, I know that this is a difficult conversation I really appreciate that you've been willing to have it with us with me for a year with others for four years.

847
01:10:25,994 --> 01:10:32,498
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I respect where you're coming from and I just want to reiterate that I don't want to repeat our conversation from earlier from two weeks ago, etc.

848
01:10:34,005 --> 01:10:39,369
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, to the extent that we're having this conversation in the public forum, just for the sake of responding to you and putting it on the record.

849
01:10:40,049 --> 01:10:47,515
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I do want to emphasize that, you know, again, our intent here is not to be anti-surveillance technology.

850
01:10:47,915 --> 01:10:51,698
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that there is a reason that the ordinance is called Community Control over Public Surveillance.

851
01:10:51,718 --> 01:10:59,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's evidenced by our December Committee of the Whole when we had a whole range of city departments petitioning for exemptions or asking questions.

852
01:10:59,483 --> 01:11:00,304
[SPEAKER_10]: How will this affect me?

853
01:11:00,384 --> 01:11:01,244
[SPEAKER_10]: How will this affect me?

854
01:11:01,865 --> 01:11:03,186
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really not our intent to

855
01:11:03,897 --> 01:11:09,639
[SPEAKER_10]: target your very reliable department specifically, and I hope that you know that that intent is sincere.

856
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:12,979
[SPEAKER_10]: We've done our best to enshrine that in the language of the ordinance.

857
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:20,501
[SPEAKER_10]: This is intended to be proactive, not reactive to anything that your department or any other has done or done wrong.

858
01:11:21,201 --> 01:11:22,982
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think I try to say often

859
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:25,810
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, policy and ordinances.

860
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:29,311
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not about just today and they're not about tomorrow and not about next week.

861
01:11:29,331 --> 01:11:31,712
[SPEAKER_10]: They're about decades and even generations.

862
01:11:31,752 --> 01:11:37,514
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they're about putting something in place that will benefit the community when nobody who's currently in this room is still in this room.

863
01:11:38,254 --> 01:11:47,458
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we've tried our best to create a policy that will be right for the community, even when, you know, there's the next Jack Buckley leading the police department.

864
01:11:47,478 --> 01:11:52,700
[SPEAKER_10]: And even when the city council looks entirely different so that we still have those structures for community input

865
01:11:53,335 --> 01:11:56,477
[SPEAKER_10]: for transparency, regardless of who is at the helm.

866
01:11:58,098 --> 01:12:08,323
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, over the past year, we've heard your very reasonable concerns about making sure that this is something that you can actually do, because we all know you have so much on your plate, and we've tried to only pare down this ordinance.

867
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:21,050
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to say all that for context, for folks watching at home, for others who are participants in this process, and to say, you know, I really do appreciate your good faith discussions with us throughout this entire process.

868
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:22,931
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really appreciated, and I hope that you do feel

869
01:12:23,608 --> 01:12:23,828
[SPEAKER_10]: heard.

870
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:24,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

871
01:12:24,669 --> 01:12:24,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

872
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:26,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

873
01:12:27,631 --> 01:12:28,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

874
01:12:28,652 --> 01:12:37,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Chief, if you could, um, maybe elaborate what happened in Cambridge and what the situation is over there in relationship to the rules that we had being proposed there.

875
01:12:38,619 --> 01:12:51,268
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, so in relation to the rules being proposed, unfortunately, uh, people's rules different than ours, and they're having a controversy with what happened over there a few weeks ago.

876
01:12:51,672 --> 01:12:55,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the point that one of those Cambridge does have a similar C cops, so that's right.

877
01:12:55,314 --> 01:12:57,355
[SPEAKER_15]: Cambridge doesn't have his body on campus, right?

878
01:12:57,375 --> 01:13:02,858
[SPEAKER_15]: So a lot of the language in here will never impact 41 cameras because they just don't have.

879
01:13:02,998 --> 01:13:04,839
[SPEAKER_15]: We're trying to implement a program.

880
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:11,643
[SPEAKER_15]: My reference earlier was to the, you know, to the tragic events that happened.

881
01:13:11,663 --> 01:13:15,225
[SPEAKER_15]: The police involved shooting and, you know, there was a public outcry

882
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:22,375
[SPEAKER_15]: justified to some degree, that they want body-worn camera footage to see what happened.

883
01:13:23,257 --> 01:13:27,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Cameras don't tell you everything, but they can give you some

884
01:13:27,898 --> 01:13:30,119
[SPEAKER_15]: some basis of to what the facts were.

885
01:13:30,519 --> 01:13:42,202
[SPEAKER_15]: And Cambridge has the police department and I know many of the offices and they've historically asked for 41 cameras and they've been denied for various reasons and some of it political.

886
01:13:42,262 --> 01:13:45,823
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't want this to prevent us from getting 41 cameras in the street.

887
01:13:46,043 --> 01:13:47,264
[SPEAKER_15]: That was what the reference was for.

888
01:13:47,864 --> 01:13:49,104
[SPEAKER_15]: So will they have a similar ordinance?

889
01:13:49,904 --> 01:13:52,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Doesn't matter if they exclude 41 cameras because they don't have them.

890
01:13:53,027 --> 01:13:57,651
[SPEAKER_15]: and there was never an intent, in my understanding, to bring body-worn cameras.

891
01:13:57,972 --> 01:13:59,933
[SPEAKER_15]: That whole argument has probably changed right now.

892
01:14:00,093 --> 01:14:05,058
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm willing to bet you that body-worn cameras are coming to the city of Cambridge, and they will have to re-argue.

893
01:14:05,538 --> 01:14:16,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, even the city of Cambridge, for example, puts body-worn cameras and doesn't exempt them from the CCOPS ordinance, they have tremendous resources in Cambridge to be able to administer a program like this.

894
01:14:17,042 --> 01:14:18,203
[SPEAKER_15]: We just are not in Cambridge.

895
01:14:18,223 --> 01:14:19,264
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have those resources.

896
01:14:19,324 --> 01:14:20,144
[SPEAKER_15]: We're not Boston.

897
01:14:20,204 --> 01:14:21,385
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have those resources.

898
01:14:21,746 --> 01:14:22,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Boston does have.

899
01:14:23,147 --> 01:14:25,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Somerville excludes body-worn cameras, right?

900
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:25,889
[SPEAKER_15]: But they don't have them.

901
01:14:26,049 --> 01:14:27,870
[SPEAKER_15]: They cut them out of their last budget, right?

902
01:14:27,911 --> 01:14:29,992
[SPEAKER_15]: So Somerville Police wanted body-worn cameras.

903
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:32,134
[SPEAKER_15]: They budgeted $400-something thousand for them.

904
01:14:32,194 --> 01:14:36,217
[SPEAKER_15]: And then their city council removed them from the budget to support the program.

905
01:14:36,497 --> 01:14:37,018
[SPEAKER_15]: So we come from a

906
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:39,474
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of similarities, right?

907
01:14:39,614 --> 01:14:45,456
[SPEAKER_15]: We are one of those communities that's about to pass a CCOPS ordinance, but we're really not similar in community size, right?

908
01:14:45,496 --> 01:14:50,518
[SPEAKER_15]: We're a police department that has 41 cameras and trying to put them on the street, but we have less resources.

909
01:14:50,578 --> 01:14:53,840
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why this impacts us differently than some of these other communities.

910
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:55,701
[SPEAKER_15]: When it comes down to it.

911
01:14:56,721 --> 01:14:56,881
Thanks.

912
01:14:58,102 --> 01:14:59,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion from the council at this time?

913
01:14:59,782 --> 01:15:00,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Paris.

914
01:15:00,883 --> 01:15:01,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

915
01:15:01,523 --> 01:15:02,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll keep it short and just say that

916
01:15:04,137 --> 01:15:10,981
[SPEAKER_04]: appreciate you coming forward, Chief, tonight and your engagement in the discussions and negotiations prior to tonight.

917
01:15:12,062 --> 01:15:31,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that I've seen out of the conversations that I've been able to be a part of is that I personally, and I hope we can agree on at least this part, I do think that we share the same goals of having the trust and the process and the public understanding of what we're doing.

918
01:15:32,558 --> 01:15:42,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I think where we've differed is on the approach and the details of that process, you know, and from as one person involved.

919
01:15:42,781 --> 01:15:49,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've tried to find a middle ground between the two positions about which that process should look like and my hopes are that that will

920
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:53,902
[SPEAKER_04]: mean that we can move forward to achieve the goals that we do share around it.

921
01:15:54,342 --> 01:16:05,913
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, again, something that I said earlier and I'll reiterate is it's a foundation, something to look at in the long term, but also something that we can look at as practice happens and make adjustments.

922
01:16:06,293 --> 01:16:09,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think that that openness to do that is the key.

923
01:16:10,397 --> 01:16:20,399
[SPEAKER_04]: in any sense to being successful as things change and as things are so rapidly changing as a surveillance technology or the practices of implementing those technologies.

924
01:16:20,419 --> 01:16:23,040
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to say that and end there.

925
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:25,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to support this tonight.

926
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, I'm going to support it with the amendments.

927
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:34,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think as we go from that point, we'll be able to have a public process around the surveillance technology that we hadn't had before.

928
01:16:35,142 --> 01:16:35,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

929
01:16:36,283 --> 01:16:38,443
[SPEAKER_02]: If I should embarrass any other Councilors to speak,

930
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:42,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we haven't, anything else you'd like to add, Chief?

931
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:43,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, thank you.

932
01:16:43,611 --> 01:16:44,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I think we'll go.

933
01:16:44,331 --> 01:16:45,252
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the opportunity.

934
01:16:45,272 --> 01:16:45,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.

935
01:16:45,992 --> 01:16:50,373
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a number of members of the public who'd like to speak, if you could just come up to the podium.

936
01:17:02,316 --> 01:17:05,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please, and slowly for the clerk.

937
01:17:05,578 --> 01:17:06,359
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, sure.

938
01:17:06,659 --> 01:17:07,380
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening, everyone.

939
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:08,560
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Julie Flynn.

940
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,782
[SPEAKER_16]: I live at 32 Summer Road, Medford, Mass.

941
01:17:12,944 --> 01:17:18,107
[SPEAKER_16]: So I am a Medford resident and a member of Ward 8 and a member of Medford People Power.

942
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:21,169
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are the group that was the proponent of this ordinance.

943
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:25,272
[SPEAKER_16]: And for those of you who don't know us, Medford People Power is a local group.

944
01:17:25,352 --> 01:17:27,034
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been around for six years.

945
01:17:27,454 --> 01:17:31,657
[SPEAKER_16]: We are concerned about civil rights and civil liberties here in this city.

946
01:17:32,438 --> 01:17:38,901
[SPEAKER_16]: And approximately four years ago, we really saw the value of this ordinance here in Medford.

947
01:17:39,722 --> 01:17:48,886
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think Councilor Collins and Zach Beers tonight has sort of captured and said things about this ordinance that we thought about four years ago.

948
01:17:49,247 --> 01:17:52,088
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is, look, this is a 21st century issue.

949
01:17:52,448 --> 01:17:55,670
[SPEAKER_16]: It is happening in cities and towns across the United States.

950
01:17:56,150 --> 01:18:04,957
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is, as it's been explained already tonight, we have these powerful surveillance technologies that exist and are ever expanding on one hand.

951
01:18:05,377 --> 01:18:11,722
[SPEAKER_16]: And then on the other hand, we have this potential use to acquire it and using it within our own city.

952
01:18:12,162 --> 01:18:15,985
[SPEAKER_16]: So the ability of our own city to surveil us as residents.

953
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:22,470
[SPEAKER_16]: And all this ordinance sort of at a fundamental level, common sense level is saying, all right,

954
01:18:24,098 --> 01:18:27,740
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, this technology exists, the city might want it, what should we do?

955
01:18:28,260 --> 01:18:31,541
[SPEAKER_16]: And all this sort of asks for is some public input.

956
01:18:32,061 --> 01:18:36,263
[SPEAKER_16]: So if in fact someone wants to acquire it, it should go before the city council.

957
01:18:36,363 --> 01:18:40,965
[SPEAKER_16]: You as city council members should know that this is happening within our city.

958
01:18:41,125 --> 01:18:46,507
[SPEAKER_16]: We as residents should know about the use of something like that in our city.

959
01:18:47,215 --> 01:18:59,038
[SPEAKER_16]: And so anyway, so I think it is sort of just this basic ability to have democratic input in something as powerful as your own city and surveilling the residents within the city.

960
01:19:00,198 --> 01:19:05,299
[SPEAKER_16]: And I should say, and it's already been said, this ordinance doesn't ban any technologies.

961
01:19:05,879 --> 01:19:08,740
[SPEAKER_16]: It has no statement about any surveillance technology at all.

962
01:19:10,681 --> 01:19:13,921
[SPEAKER_16]: And so there's no ban on anything.

963
01:19:14,161 --> 01:19:16,682
[SPEAKER_16]: And it makes no comment about any specific technology.

964
01:19:17,187 --> 01:19:29,294
[SPEAKER_16]: And as Council Collins has pointed out, there's gonna be so many ordinances, I mean, there's gonna be so many kinds of technologies in the near future, 20 years from now, three years from now, two years from now, it doesn't matter, there's gonna be a lot.

965
01:19:29,674 --> 01:19:46,764
[SPEAKER_16]: And this ordinance is not about the state of any department here today, it's about building an ordinance that is good for now, two years from now, three years from now, dealing with an issue that does exist, which is surveilling

966
01:19:47,258 --> 01:19:49,539
[SPEAKER_16]: surveillance of us as residents.

967
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:53,042
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, it has been four years since we started.

968
01:19:53,282 --> 01:19:58,045
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just want to say it's been a journey with lots of discussions and lots of endorsements.

969
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:04,589
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, there's just been a tremendous amount of work with people power working with the mayor's office speaking with the chief.

970
01:20:05,049 --> 01:20:09,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Everyone has talked about it's been three years of different conversations going on.

971
01:20:09,952 --> 01:20:13,855
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had a webinar, inviting citizens and political groups to it.

972
01:20:14,355 --> 01:20:16,857
[SPEAKER_16]: We've gained the endorsements of many along the way.

973
01:20:17,949 --> 01:20:22,510
[SPEAKER_16]: And some of the members of the groups who have endorsed it will be here tonight to speak.

974
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:40,235
[SPEAKER_16]: We've gained the endorsements of the NAACP for the principles of this ordinance, the Human Rights Commission, Sanctuary Church, Unitarian Universal Church, Democratic City Committee, Democratic Boards 82, Safe Medford, the Welcome Project, and the West Medford Community Center.

975
01:20:40,476 --> 01:20:45,537
[SPEAKER_16]: So there has been a lot of community endorsement for the principles behind this ordinance

976
01:20:46,157 --> 01:21:01,466
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think someone will speak tonight and to give some flavor to the, you know, sort of the texture and the historical reasons why such an ordinance like this has an impact more than maybe, just has an impact for many different groups of people here within Medford.

977
01:21:01,786 --> 01:21:09,030
[SPEAKER_16]: So I wanna just thank you for the time tonight and we wish for your support.

978
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:09,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

979
01:21:09,871 --> 01:21:10,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

980
01:21:14,192 --> 01:21:15,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

981
01:21:15,433 --> 01:21:18,975
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, David Harris, 151 Sharon Street, West Medford.

982
01:21:19,555 --> 01:21:22,616
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a resident of that address for 28 years.

983
01:21:23,397 --> 01:21:27,439
[SPEAKER_01]: I've served as a chair of the Human Rights Commission for 10 years.

984
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,641
[SPEAKER_01]: These glasses are terrible, all right.

985
01:21:31,661 --> 01:21:37,224
[SPEAKER_01]: And most recently retired as a managing director of the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School.

986
01:21:38,205 --> 01:21:41,286
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also the chair of the Massachusetts Advisory Committee to the U.S.

987
01:21:41,306 --> 01:21:42,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Commission on Civil Rights.

988
01:21:43,639 --> 01:21:58,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Being a career of 50 years dedicated to race and justice, I've come to understand racism as a differential distribution of access, opportunity, health, well-being, membership, and participation in society, a structure that cuts across all of our institutions.

989
01:21:58,807 --> 01:22:11,353
[SPEAKER_01]: This differential distribution often occurs unknowingly as a by-product of policies and practices that are inserted into existing structures uncritically without regard for how they might enhance or dismantle inequality.

990
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:16,917
[SPEAKER_01]: As a resident of Medford, I'm committed to having our city act responsibly in this regard.

991
01:22:18,057 --> 01:22:31,448
[SPEAKER_01]: From my perspective, we face a crisis across the country today with serious decline in confidence in our institutions across all realms, public, private, academic, and nowhere is this crisis greater than in the area of policing.

992
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:36,552
[SPEAKER_01]: Because police are granted legitimate use of force, this crisis is more pressing.

993
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:47,868
[SPEAKER_01]: While I know this ordinance covers all departments, I'm going to focus on implications of the practice of policing, the practice, not individual officers or officials.

994
01:22:48,864 --> 01:23:00,067
[SPEAKER_01]: My work at the Houston Institute focused on what we call community justice, derived from the belief that community members can and must play a role in public policymaking and evaluation of those policies.

995
01:23:00,367 --> 01:23:04,768
[SPEAKER_01]: We hear a lot about community policing these days, which I guess is a good thing.

996
01:23:05,448 --> 01:23:08,349
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is how to translate that phrase into practice.

997
01:23:09,309 --> 01:23:12,710
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be more than basketball games and cookouts, more than officer friendly.

998
01:23:13,495 --> 01:23:24,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Community policing must include bringing the community into the policymaking process, as well as creating mechanisms for regular input from community members about performance.

999
01:23:25,181 --> 01:23:35,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Policing, indeed our entire democracy, proceeds from an implicit contract with the public, a contract whose terms may and do change over time, but whose core underpinning is trust.

1000
01:23:36,807 --> 01:23:42,070
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's world, that trust has been damaged and many people often feel at odds, if not under siege.

1001
01:23:43,421 --> 01:23:51,809
[SPEAKER_01]: It may well be that Medford is not at an extreme crisis point, but we cannot escape the need to revisit and renew the contract.

1002
01:23:53,351 --> 01:24:02,680
[SPEAKER_01]: We know our public officials have shown a willingness to acknowledge the enduring legacy of past racial injustice for which all residents are thankful for that acknowledgement.

1003
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:07,244
[SPEAKER_01]: While awareness and acknowledgement are important steps, they're only that.

1004
01:24:08,193 --> 01:24:13,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, excuse me, we must act with intentionality in the present and anticipation of the future.

1005
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:19,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And that future is sure to bring an increase in the use of surveillance technology.

1006
01:24:20,788 --> 01:24:38,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I'm persuaded that this ordinance will not place undue burdens on those agencies it affects, any such cost may well be the price we pay for days gone by when we cut corners on the rights of some of our neighbors, whether people of color, women, newcomers, differentially abled, or others.

1007
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:44,479
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two specific concerns about the use of technology in law enforcement and public policymaking.

1008
01:24:44,519 --> 01:24:47,080
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is a matter of the technology itself.

1009
01:24:49,225 --> 01:24:55,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's technology is astounding in its ability to analyze data, and we can only imagine it will become more powerful in the future.

1010
01:24:56,750 --> 01:25:05,155
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know this technology is flawed, that it reproduces many of the biases and resulting inaccuracies that racial antipathy wrought in the past.

1011
01:25:06,616 --> 01:25:11,759
[SPEAKER_01]: In doing so, even in its neutral or impartial application, it carries great risk of harm.

1012
01:25:13,348 --> 01:25:15,868
[SPEAKER_01]: That alone is reason to exercise extreme caution.

1013
01:25:16,489 --> 01:25:19,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Powerful as it may be, technology is far from perfect.

1014
01:25:20,809 --> 01:25:27,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, the technology will be used by human beings and we are all flawed and subject to error.

1015
01:25:28,011 --> 01:25:38,973
[SPEAKER_01]: We can think about various forms of training to protect us from missteps, but reflect on how long we've had implicit bias training and yet it continues to arise in both clinical and everyday settings.

1016
01:25:40,553 --> 01:25:53,678
[SPEAKER_01]: As we contemplate the use of more and more technology in governing, there's an increased rather than decreased need for formal mechanisms of transparency and accountability to residents and elected officials such as yourselves.

1017
01:25:54,818 --> 01:26:06,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Creating this ordinance will be a way to affirm the contract between government and the governed, which in turn could boost the legitimacy of government, including but not limited to policing in our city.

1018
01:26:08,928 --> 01:26:24,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna close by thanking you all for your diligence on this matter, for your leadership, and the opportunity for us to take a step toward keeping Medford in the forefront of liberty in this country.

1019
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:25,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1020
01:26:31,939 --> 01:26:34,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to Munir Germanis on Zoom.

1021
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:38,551
[SPEAKER_02]: should, there you go.

1022
01:26:38,591 --> 01:26:39,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

1023
01:26:42,113 --> 01:26:49,197
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Munir Germanus, and I live at 3 Summit Road in Medford.

1024
01:26:50,298 --> 01:26:58,743
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm speaking tonight on behalf of the Medford Human Rights Commission, where I have served for over five years, three of which as chair.

1025
01:26:59,728 --> 01:27:28,855
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned in my letter to all members of the city council on October 14th of 2020, and again on October 12th of last year, the commission voted to endorse and reaffirm the principles and goals of community control of public surveillance, and to urge all members of the city council to support the current CCOPS ordinance that is under consideration by the council.

1026
01:27:29,965 --> 01:27:43,312
[SPEAKER_00]: We realize that such an ordinance will involve some difficult discussions and negotiations that involve the city administration, the police and other departments who would be affected by the ordinance.

1027
01:27:44,153 --> 01:27:56,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the past four years, this process has involved an amazing open discussion between the various parties involved as each party seeks to protect their own interest.

1028
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:11,933
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have full confidence in each and every member of the City Council that they will protect the interests of the City, the various departments involved, and all its residents in these discussions.

1029
01:28:12,729 --> 01:28:19,112
[SPEAKER_00]: We are proud that our city council is involved in this process as our representatives in city government.

1030
01:28:19,812 --> 01:28:27,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Passing such an ordinance will demonstrate that our voice is being heard in this critical issue.

1031
01:28:27,981 --> 01:28:41,453
[SPEAKER_00]: The failure to agree on passing such an ordinance will send a message that the community will be excluded from any discussions and decision making of critical matters that affect this community.

1032
01:28:42,093 --> 01:28:50,801
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, I respectfully urge each and every member of this council to vote in favor of this ordinance.

1033
01:28:51,441 --> 01:28:54,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your attention and for your consideration.

1034
01:28:55,245 --> 01:28:55,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1035
01:28:57,212 --> 01:29:00,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else who would like to speak either in person or on Zoom?

1036
01:29:06,794 --> 01:29:07,794
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

1037
01:29:10,635 --> 01:29:11,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, actually.

1038
01:29:12,235 --> 01:29:13,795
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at 36 Hillside Avenue.

1039
01:29:13,835 --> 01:29:15,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, could you hold the beat?

1040
01:29:15,056 --> 01:29:18,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I realize you're not the clerk, so just, or he can go back to the minutes.

1041
01:29:19,557 --> 01:29:20,837
[SPEAKER_02]: He can, okay, well, he can watch the video.

1042
01:29:25,328 --> 01:29:40,504
[SPEAKER_11]: I am a member of Safe Medford, which is a nonpartisan group of Medford residents that advocates for policies, services and education to ensure the safety and dignity of all who live, work, worship and do business in Medford.

1043
01:29:42,733 --> 01:29:55,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Safe Medford joined People Power in an effort to create a new official policy guidelines for police interaction with all community members, regardless of immigration status.

1044
01:29:56,461 --> 01:30:03,686
[SPEAKER_11]: We worked with both the past and the current chief of police to eventually codify those procedures.

1045
01:30:05,146 --> 01:30:10,930
[SPEAKER_11]: We are again joining Medford People Power in support of the CCOPS ordinance under your consideration.

1046
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:19,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Three years ago, I listened to Chief Buckley's remarks at the city's Martin Luther King holiday event.

1047
01:30:20,954 --> 01:30:28,997
[SPEAKER_11]: In one of his first public appearances, Chief Buckley made a commitment to the people of Medford to bring

1048
01:30:30,667 --> 01:30:48,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford policing into the 21st century, he pointedly stressed that that meant first acknowledging the historical legacy of harm that police forces committed, particularly and disproportionately to people of color.

1049
01:30:50,313 --> 01:30:51,353
[SPEAKER_11]: In his remarks,

1050
01:30:52,488 --> 01:31:05,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Chief Buckley also vowed to work to create trust between Medford's law enforcement and all of Medford's residents, and most especially with its marginalized communities.

1051
01:31:06,751 --> 01:31:14,893
[SPEAKER_11]: Seacops is one of the places where the rubber meets the road, where the chief's commitment to a 21st century police force is now being tested.

1052
01:31:16,777 --> 01:31:28,383
[SPEAKER_11]: allowing government to conduct surveillance activities without adequate public oversight keeps the door open to misuse and leads to more mistrust.

1053
01:31:29,844 --> 01:31:33,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Transparency is essential to building trust.

1054
01:31:35,066 --> 01:31:37,287
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a key to accountability.

1055
01:31:38,748 --> 01:31:40,849
[SPEAKER_11]: CCOPS moves us in the right direction.

1056
01:31:41,469 --> 01:31:43,410
[SPEAKER_11]: I urge you to support this ordinance.

1057
01:31:43,690 --> 01:31:43,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1058
01:31:50,742 --> 01:31:53,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Reverend Wendy Miller Olapade on Zoom.

1059
01:31:53,403 --> 01:31:54,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll unmute you.

1060
01:31:58,684 --> 01:31:59,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it again.

1061
01:31:59,224 --> 01:32:04,686
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try one more time.

1062
01:32:06,766 --> 01:32:08,367
[SPEAKER_09]: You should see, there we go.

1063
01:32:08,607 --> 01:32:09,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, okay, there we go.

1064
01:32:09,587 --> 01:32:12,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I didn't realize I had to do it myself as well.

1065
01:32:14,434 --> 01:32:22,962
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a resident of Medford live at 105 Brooks Street, and as of this week I will have been a resident here for 10 years.

1066
01:32:24,323 --> 01:32:33,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much for giving me a chance to speak and thank you to all of our Councilors for continuing to work on this ordinance.

1067
01:32:34,188 --> 01:32:40,573
[SPEAKER_09]: The last time I participated in some public comments about this ordinance, I spoke about the values of community and accountability.

1068
01:32:41,093 --> 01:32:46,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Tonight, I want to speak to the values of equity, justice, and the issue of civil rights.

1069
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:57,660
[SPEAKER_09]: I expect the servants that I elect to protect my privacy and my civil rights and the privacy and the civil rights of all of my neighbors, all of my neighbors.

1070
01:32:58,500 --> 01:33:10,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I also expect that the civil servants that my taxes employ and the officials that my votes elect are attending to the safety and the well-being of all of Medford's residents equitably.

1071
01:33:11,473 --> 01:33:30,362
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, our history and the data about civil rights and civil liberties demonstrate that there is a need for oversight, for a democratic process, for public and legal oversight to ensure the equitable implementation of justice and safety services, because it has not been just.

1072
01:33:31,143 --> 01:33:35,685
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do need to put processes in place to make sure that it gets just.

1073
01:33:36,577 --> 01:33:45,029
[SPEAKER_09]: The city council has spoken regularly about transparency and accountability, and is wagging its finger regularly about that.

1074
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:51,199
[SPEAKER_09]: So I ask you my elected representative representatives to vote in favor of this ordinance.

1075
01:33:51,619 --> 01:34:09,007
[SPEAKER_09]: to ensure that transparency and accountability and protection of all of our civil liberties are assured by law in the use of the tools that have an impact on my civil liberties, on my civil rights, which we, as we have already heard, this technology does.

1076
01:34:09,467 --> 01:34:14,089
[SPEAKER_09]: It has an impact on my civil rights, and I want you to control it.

1077
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:22,465
[SPEAKER_09]: I expect my government to represent the rights of all of our citizens and the values that have been expressed by the other speakers who've chosen to speak.

1078
01:34:23,005 --> 01:34:31,971
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not expect my city council to be afraid to vote in favor of ordinances that clearly protect civil liberties and accountability to their electors.

1079
01:34:32,471 --> 01:34:39,235
[SPEAKER_09]: This is simply the right thing to do to protect all of us and to protect our civil servants' ability to do their jobs.

1080
01:34:39,496 --> 01:34:41,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Please vote in favor of this ordinance.

1081
01:34:41,557 --> 01:34:41,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1082
01:34:42,858 --> 01:34:43,118
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1083
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:44,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Madam President.

1084
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:47,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anyone else?

1085
01:34:47,495 --> 01:34:48,575
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any hands up on zoom.

1086
01:34:48,595 --> 01:34:49,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anyone else?

1087
01:34:49,596 --> 01:34:50,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Mr. Castagnetti.

1088
01:34:51,538 --> 01:34:51,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1089
01:34:53,059 --> 01:34:53,499
[SPEAKER_02]: You came back.

1090
01:34:57,362 --> 01:34:57,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.

1091
01:35:02,966 --> 01:35:03,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Hang on one minute.

1092
01:35:03,987 --> 01:35:04,447
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1093
01:35:05,288 --> 01:35:05,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1094
01:35:06,729 --> 01:35:12,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I'm very, I don't understand this 14 page, I believe ordinance.

1095
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:18,222
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think 99% of the people in the city understand that either, nor have they even read it.

1096
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:26,845
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm hearing things that sound pretty touching on both ends of the spectrum here.

1097
01:35:28,546 --> 01:35:35,168
[SPEAKER_14]: To be fully honest and full disclosure, I am a Woodstock graduate, 1969 in Bethel.

1098
01:35:37,289 --> 01:35:40,370
[SPEAKER_14]: And I wasn't a big fan of cops in those days.

1099
01:35:41,724 --> 01:35:46,186
[SPEAKER_14]: or Big Brother putting their nose in our business still.

1100
01:35:47,487 --> 01:35:55,150
[SPEAKER_14]: However, if something is happening that's violent and it's not fair, I mean, who are you gonna call?

1101
01:35:56,611 --> 01:36:02,393
[SPEAKER_14]: I think people wanna call the cops, not Ghostbusters or Dr. Phil or Phyllis.

1102
01:36:03,354 --> 01:36:09,156
[SPEAKER_14]: You're in deep trouble, and chances are, even if they're like three houses away, they won't get there in time, mind you.

1103
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:14,364
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have one concern.

1104
01:36:16,546 --> 01:36:20,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that I'm a fan of cameras, the big brother thing.

1105
01:36:20,548 --> 01:36:37,841
[SPEAKER_14]: However, if a camera catches someone stabbing you, I would hope, I wouldn't hope, I would demand that that video, if it's authentic and not fake, should be shown in a court of law to

1106
01:36:42,118 --> 01:36:43,159
[SPEAKER_14]: Convict the culprit.

1107
01:36:45,182 --> 01:36:46,805
[SPEAKER_14]: And it should be colorblind, the camera.

1108
01:36:48,287 --> 01:36:48,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Period.

1109
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:52,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Madam President.

1110
01:36:52,292 --> 01:36:54,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve the paper for first reading as amended.

1111
01:36:55,503 --> 01:36:56,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion from the council?

1112
01:36:56,704 --> 01:36:57,245
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng?

1113
01:36:57,545 --> 01:37:01,729
[SPEAKER_13]: Just a very short comment from my personal perspective, having served on the committee.

1114
01:37:02,490 --> 01:37:08,256
[SPEAKER_13]: I wanted to thank all of our speakers tonight for being so eloquent, no matter what they were speaking for.

1115
01:37:08,717 --> 01:37:17,986
[SPEAKER_13]: When I think about this ordinance in front of us, I think about democracy, transparency, and productivity, and with the combination of those three, building trust in government.

1116
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:23,290
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the process that we've gone through really highlights the best of democracy.

1117
01:37:23,711 --> 01:37:31,556
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had good faith negotiations, compromise, we've had activists who've engaged their elected officials on an issue that they've really cared about.

1118
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:37,080
[SPEAKER_13]: And as a young person of color, I especially thank you guys for that work.

1119
01:37:37,981 --> 01:37:43,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there's a lot of, the fact is that there's a lot of work that we can do to rebuild trust.

1120
01:37:45,046 --> 01:37:47,628
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is the first step of many that we can take.

1121
01:37:48,349 --> 01:37:49,730
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's an exciting step.

1122
01:37:51,411 --> 01:38:04,383
[SPEAKER_13]: I truly do believe that this product is tailor made for a city and look, people might not be completely happy with it, no matter the side of the political political spectrum but that is a it's a fact of compromise and

1123
01:38:04,943 --> 01:38:05,963
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a feature of democracy.

1124
01:38:07,224 --> 01:38:25,991
[SPEAKER_13]: I especially, I think, like how this ordinance uses community-centric approach to make us a public forum where residents can make their opinions heard, where they can learn about what we're doing as a city, and where we can help facilitate a trusting relationship between city government and our residents.

1125
01:38:26,892 --> 01:38:32,694
[SPEAKER_13]: And by letting the public have a voice in our discussions, I think we're really just crowdsourcing their knowledge

1126
01:38:35,575 --> 01:38:36,856
[SPEAKER_13]: making more critical decisions.

1127
01:38:37,136 --> 01:38:39,576
[SPEAKER_13]: And so with that, I'll second the motion to approve.

1128
01:38:40,276 --> 01:38:41,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1129
01:38:41,437 --> 01:38:46,438
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I could just briefly from the chair, I also want to say thank the chief and everyone who worked on this.

1130
01:38:47,758 --> 01:38:55,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the amount of, I think, good faith discussion around this and kind of moving the needle both ways, I think is a model for things going forward.

1131
01:38:55,820 --> 01:39:02,061
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to say for me, in addition to everything that's been said tonight, for me, it comes down to the technology.

1132
01:39:02,222 --> 01:39:03,782
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a lack of faith in

1133
01:39:04,522 --> 01:39:10,906
[SPEAKER_02]: You Chief, I absolutely have very much faith in you, and I think we've had a lot of great conversations that I really appreciated.

1134
01:39:11,727 --> 01:39:22,994
[SPEAKER_02]: But the technology, it evolves at such a rapid rate, and I think we've seen, and it's a known fact that ethics are often a last thought when it comes to technology, if a thought at all.

1135
01:39:23,474 --> 01:39:25,836
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is just something that's putting guardrails on that.

1136
01:39:25,876 --> 01:39:31,980
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, as it's been, but I just want to reiterate, even though it's been said, it doesn't ban or even comment on any specific technology.

1137
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:35,892
[SPEAKER_02]: but it gives the opportunity for us to know what might be used in our city.

1138
01:39:36,353 --> 01:39:45,016
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do think one of the residents too, I believe was Mr. Harris just saying that this is a real opportunity for 21st century community policing.

1139
01:39:45,216 --> 01:39:51,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it really gives them having the community able just to know what's going on is really, really important.

1140
01:39:51,399 --> 01:39:53,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an important step towards that.

1141
01:39:53,460 --> 01:40:00,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thank everyone for their work on this for all of their comments and thoughts and for being here once again tonight to discuss this.

1142
01:40:00,919 --> 01:40:02,880
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a motion on the floor from Vice President Bears.

1143
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:04,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Caraviello?

1144
01:40:04,321 --> 01:40:06,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we passing the amendments first?

1145
01:40:07,942 --> 01:40:12,244
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion is to approve as amended for first reading.

1146
01:40:12,444 --> 01:40:13,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just doing the amendments first?

1147
01:40:14,365 --> 01:40:15,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the whole paper?

1148
01:40:16,206 --> 01:40:18,507
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion is to take all the amendments, so.

1149
01:40:19,228 --> 01:40:21,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if we need two votes, I propose the amendments.

1150
01:40:21,669 --> 01:40:24,570
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to vote on the amendments and then vote on the paper, I'm more than fine with that.

1151
01:40:24,870 --> 01:40:26,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should vote.

1152
01:40:26,151 --> 01:40:27,892
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should.

1153
01:40:28,732 --> 01:40:29,753
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take the amendments.

1154
01:40:36,559 --> 01:40:40,182
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll withdraw my second motion and I'll move to amend the ordinance as I had read earlier.

1155
01:40:40,822 --> 01:40:41,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1156
01:40:41,903 --> 01:40:55,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears to amend the ordinance based on the 12 amendments presented earlier that are also in the hands of the clerk, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1157
01:40:55,534 --> 01:40:56,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1158
01:41:26,911 --> 01:41:27,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

1159
01:41:27,652 --> 01:41:27,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1160
01:41:29,453 --> 01:41:29,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1161
01:41:30,174 --> 01:41:30,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1162
01:41:32,135 --> 01:41:32,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Stroud.

1163
01:41:33,136 --> 01:41:33,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1164
01:41:35,278 --> 01:41:35,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

1165
01:41:35,898 --> 01:41:36,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1166
01:41:36,118 --> 01:41:37,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Bears.

1167
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:37,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1168
01:41:37,900 --> 01:41:40,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an information on the night of the motion passes.

1169
01:41:41,443 --> 01:41:43,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve the ordinance for first reading as amended.

1170
01:41:44,285 --> 01:41:50,370
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Vice President Bears to approve the ordinance for first reading as amended, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1171
01:41:51,551 --> 01:41:52,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1172
01:42:00,462 --> 01:42:00,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1173
01:42:00,662 --> 01:42:00,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1174
01:42:00,802 --> 01:42:00,882
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1175
01:42:00,922 --> 01:42:05,385
[SPEAKER_06]: For the affirmative three in the negative the motion passes.

1176
01:42:05,465 --> 01:42:07,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Passes for first reading.

1177
01:42:07,466 --> 01:42:10,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we have one more paper.

1178
01:42:31,194 --> 01:42:49,386
[SPEAKER_02]: to one that's 053 offered by Councilor Collins housing stability notification ordinance motion to suspend the reading in favor of a brief summary on the motion of vices and affairs to suspend the reading in favor of a brief summary seconded by Councilor Gabriella all those in favor, I suppose motion passes, going back to you once more Councilor Collins very brief summary.

1179
01:42:50,547 --> 01:42:51,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Brown.

1180
01:42:53,095 --> 01:42:57,557
[SPEAKER_10]: What a treat to have two of my ordinance projects come before the council on the very same night.

1181
01:42:57,617 --> 01:42:58,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Good thing it's a holiday.

1182
01:42:59,198 --> 01:43:01,319
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very glad to be bringing this forward tonight.

1183
01:43:01,619 --> 01:43:05,520
[SPEAKER_10]: This paper was first proposed by Councilor John Falco in 2021.

1184
01:43:06,041 --> 01:43:11,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Very grateful to him for proposing this paper and for the opportunity to carry the project forward as Housing Subcommittee Chair.

1185
01:43:12,383 --> 01:43:15,945
[SPEAKER_10]: In contrast to the ordinance that we just discussed, this ordinance is extremely simple.

1186
01:43:16,685 --> 01:43:28,776
[SPEAKER_10]: It creates a new requirement that all property owners in Medford distribute a simple, perhaps one or two page document prepared for them by the city to their tenants at the beginning and termination of any lease or upon eviction.

1187
01:43:29,296 --> 01:43:32,419
[SPEAKER_10]: This document would also be provided to homeowners that are being foreclosed upon.

1188
01:43:33,059 --> 01:43:40,305
[SPEAKER_10]: The goal of this policy is to make sure that all residents in Medford are aware of the housing rights to which they are already entitled, and the resources that are already available to them.

1189
01:43:41,106 --> 01:43:46,969
[SPEAKER_10]: People should know what their rights are, what to expect, and where to turn for help before some kind of stressful or emergency situation occurs.

1190
01:43:47,490 --> 01:43:48,890
[SPEAKER_10]: This information is often hard to find.

1191
01:43:49,651 --> 01:43:56,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Whether you're a tenant, an owner, or an owner being foreclosed upon, having to scramble for information, or not know where to turn for help benefits nobody.

1192
01:43:57,195 --> 01:44:01,918
[SPEAKER_10]: This ordinance ensures that relevant information is distributed through the community in a streamlined way proactively.

1193
01:44:02,758 --> 01:44:05,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to just briefly outline the process of this project.

1194
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:10,983
[SPEAKER_10]: The council has been meeting on this paper since the fall first in the housing subcommittee, and then in a recent committee of the whole.

1195
01:44:11,563 --> 01:44:18,768
[SPEAKER_10]: We began by discussing the examples of three of our neighboring communities, Cambridge Boston and Somerville, who also have housing stability notification ordinances.

1196
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:23,770
[SPEAKER_10]: We compared and contrasted these ordinances and selected the best parts of each example.

1197
01:44:24,130 --> 01:44:28,912
[SPEAKER_10]: We also reviewed the actual notification document that's currently used in each of these cities to inform our discussion.

1198
01:44:29,633 --> 01:44:33,615
[SPEAKER_10]: At every step we discussed the ordinance with the city departments that would be implicated by this ordinance.

1199
01:44:34,275 --> 01:44:37,276
[SPEAKER_10]: These partners included the Board of Health, which stepped up to do enforcement.

1200
01:44:37,977 --> 01:44:42,259
[SPEAKER_10]: The Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability volunteered to create the housing notification document.

1201
01:44:43,103 --> 01:44:49,865
[SPEAKER_10]: based on resource documents that their office already has available, and they also consulted on how to best begin the rollout of this ordinance.

1202
01:44:50,526 --> 01:44:58,928
[SPEAKER_10]: The Office of Prevention and Outreach, whose work in our community is closely aligned with the goals of this ordinance, offered their insight on equity and implementation strategies.

1203
01:44:59,729 --> 01:45:08,792
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very heartened that this ordinance has the approval and even the enthusiasm of our city departments that are already responsible for housing stability and community outreach projects in our community.

1204
01:45:10,120 --> 01:45:14,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, I just want to say this is an ordinance that is primarily intended as an educational tool.

1205
01:45:14,662 --> 01:45:27,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks to the collaboration and the input of our city partners, I believe that this ordinance will be simple to implement and serve as another tool toolbox for promoting stable housing in Medford, through expanding awareness of existing housing rights and resources in our community.

1206
01:45:28,107 --> 01:45:28,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1207
01:45:30,228 --> 01:45:30,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1208
01:45:31,008 --> 01:45:31,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

1209
01:45:31,889 --> 01:45:33,489
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm looking at this.

1210
01:45:33,509 --> 01:45:38,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question as to how it would work relative to the students in the dormitories

1211
01:45:43,201 --> 01:45:46,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Has that been under consideration or is that exempt from this?

1212
01:45:48,745 --> 01:45:52,268
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, so students in the dorm, they say you gotta go, school's over.

1213
01:45:52,509 --> 01:45:53,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't wanna go, I wanna stay.

1214
01:45:54,310 --> 01:45:55,391
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna stay for the summer.

1215
01:45:56,131 --> 01:45:58,974
[SPEAKER_08]: We gotta give you notice, you gotta take it through the eviction process.

1216
01:45:59,014 --> 01:46:02,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm not sure, I'm trying to figure out how that would apply.

1217
01:46:02,977 --> 01:46:03,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins?

1218
01:46:03,617 --> 01:46:04,358
[SPEAKER_08]: To the university.

1219
01:46:04,818 --> 01:46:05,019
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1220
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:09,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Or off campus housing in the university for that matter, you know what I mean?

1221
01:46:09,402 --> 01:46:09,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, thank you.

1222
01:46:10,203 --> 01:46:10,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry?

1223
01:46:11,381 --> 01:46:13,329
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know who to place a burden on the university.

1224
01:46:13,349 --> 01:46:15,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean ultimately they house thousands of kids up there, right?

1225
01:46:16,557 --> 01:46:17,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins.

1226
01:46:17,658 --> 01:46:19,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you for that question, Councilor Knight.

1227
01:46:19,560 --> 01:46:26,566
[SPEAKER_10]: This doesn't currently exempt any housing situations other than short or long-term like hospital care facilities in the city of Medford.

1228
01:46:27,607 --> 01:46:34,593
[SPEAKER_10]: So I believe it would implicate student housing situations, whether that's private property owners or the dormitories themselves.

1229
01:46:35,734 --> 01:46:40,258
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanna be clear, this doesn't create any new housing rights or responsibilities.

1230
01:46:40,339 --> 01:46:42,721
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't create the right to remain

1231
01:46:43,982 --> 01:46:47,125
[SPEAKER_10]: in a housing situation for longer than a person would already be able to do that.

1232
01:46:48,286 --> 01:46:52,130
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a simple document that's delivered upon move in and move out.

1233
01:46:52,570 --> 01:46:59,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, but what it does do is it creates a punitive situation for where if the property owner fails to provide the certain notice, they're going to be fined $300 a day.

1234
01:46:59,417 --> 01:47:06,884
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we have a property on a Tufts University that has 900 kids in housing, and they fail to comply,

1235
01:47:08,273 --> 01:47:11,780
[SPEAKER_08]: 900 times 300 times 300 times every day at the fine.

1236
01:47:11,980 --> 01:47:12,481
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

1237
01:47:12,782 --> 01:47:14,124
[SPEAKER_08]: They're one of our bodies in the community.

1238
01:47:14,144 --> 01:47:15,667
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want to put an administrative burden on them.

1239
01:47:15,687 --> 01:47:16,508
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be punitive.

1240
01:47:20,373 --> 01:47:21,073
[SPEAKER_08]: I support the paper.

1241
01:47:21,093 --> 01:47:22,974
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, I think the fines excessive really is what it is.

1242
01:47:23,014 --> 01:47:25,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if it was 25 bucks or something like that, yeah, fine.

1243
01:47:25,354 --> 01:47:28,015
[SPEAKER_08]: 300 bucks for not sending somebody a notice about what their rights are when they get evicted.

1244
01:47:28,555 --> 01:47:29,255
[SPEAKER_08]: When, you know what I mean?

1245
01:47:29,435 --> 01:47:31,956
[SPEAKER_08]: We have all heard the term caveat emptied by everywhere, right?

1246
01:47:32,776 --> 01:47:37,817
[SPEAKER_08]: You also have to be able to have some accountability personally and know what your rights are as well, right?

1247
01:47:37,837 --> 01:47:40,418
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not government's job to hold everybody's hand all the time, right?

1248
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:43,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Some people have to have some certain personal accountability, right?

1249
01:47:43,619 --> 01:47:45,899
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you run into a situation where you're gonna be evicted, right?

1250
01:47:46,359 --> 01:47:47,700
[SPEAKER_08]: You might wanna say, hey, what are my rights?

1251
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I'm being evicted.

1252
01:47:50,615 --> 01:47:52,176
[SPEAKER_08]: and have some personal accountability as well.

1253
01:47:52,617 --> 01:48:00,043
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think that the $300 fine is very excessive, especially because it's for every day that passes, it's another $300, and it constitutes another violation.

1254
01:48:00,523 --> 01:48:04,426
[SPEAKER_08]: If we brought that down to, you know, 25 bucks or 50 bucks, I would have a problem.

1255
01:48:05,908 --> 01:48:07,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins, Advices and Affairs.

1256
01:48:08,109 --> 01:48:08,810
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Morell.

1257
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:12,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight, for entertaining this line of questions.

1258
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:19,759
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that we discussed similar issues with the Director of the Board of Health at our recent

1259
01:48:20,183 --> 01:48:23,264
[SPEAKER_10]: committee of the whole around enforcement, the fee structure, fine structure.

1260
01:48:24,305 --> 01:48:32,248
[SPEAKER_10]: The $300 was booked because it's statutorily defined and also because it's commensurate with other fines for ordinances that we already have in the books in the city of Medford.

1261
01:48:32,728 --> 01:48:44,472
[SPEAKER_10]: More importantly, when we discussed, when we were kind of first hashing out who would enforce the ordinance earlier in the subcommittee process after it was determined that it'd be more appropriate for it to be the Board of Health rather than code enforcement.

1262
01:48:45,813 --> 01:48:46,553
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, like I said,

1263
01:48:47,324 --> 01:48:50,686
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is a phrase that I probably borrowed directly from Director O'Connor.

1264
01:48:50,706 --> 01:48:52,907
[SPEAKER_10]: This is primarily intended to be an educational tool.

1265
01:48:53,388 --> 01:48:59,471
[SPEAKER_10]: This ordinance isn't on the books that we can go around issuing $300 fines to landlords that don't know that this is something they're supposed to be doing.

1266
01:49:00,132 --> 01:49:11,038
[SPEAKER_10]: After all, the penalty for the first warning is a written fine, and this is to be endorsed, sorry, enforced at the discretion of, in this case, the Board of Health Director or their designee.

1267
01:49:11,078 --> 01:49:13,720
[SPEAKER_10]: So I say that to say, I don't think that this is the kind of thing where

1268
01:49:14,777 --> 01:49:30,827
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, if a landlord is delinked and accidentally, or we have some kind of extenuating circumstance, overall, it's at the discretion of the director of the Board of Health to enforce this towards the goal of actually promoting housing stability, not towards it generating revenue.

1269
01:49:30,867 --> 01:49:35,369
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was a discussion that we had pretty explicitly with the Board of Health director earlier in this ordinance process.

1270
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:42,954
[SPEAKER_08]: That discretion part is what makes me curious, especially after listening to what Mr. Harris had to say a few minutes ago.

1271
01:49:44,082 --> 01:49:45,623
[SPEAKER_08]: What's good for the goose should be good for the gander.

1272
01:49:45,643 --> 01:49:46,524
[SPEAKER_08]: It shouldn't be at discretion.

1273
01:49:46,564 --> 01:49:47,784
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's violation, it's a violation.

1274
01:49:47,804 --> 01:49:49,105
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not, it's not, right?

1275
01:49:49,566 --> 01:49:55,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, ultimately what we're doing is putting language in here to say that the board of health director can haphazardly policy if they see fit, right?

1276
01:49:56,070 --> 01:49:57,210
[SPEAKER_08]: And fine up to $300, right?

1277
01:49:57,371 --> 01:49:59,172
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's what we're looking to do.

1278
01:49:59,212 --> 01:50:00,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's what the goal objective is.

1279
01:50:03,363 --> 01:50:07,427
[SPEAKER_08]: So ultimately, we're saying the Board of Health Director may at their discretion do this, right?

1280
01:50:07,808 --> 01:50:09,810
[SPEAKER_08]: So ultimately, we're talking about issues of equity.

1281
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:11,592
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about government not being trusted.

1282
01:50:12,052 --> 01:50:13,914
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about putting controls in on government.

1283
01:50:14,915 --> 01:50:19,680
[SPEAKER_08]: But then we're going to give somebody the authority to act haphazard and apply policy unevenly.

1284
01:50:21,702 --> 01:50:23,103
[SPEAKER_04]: So the specific things here, number one,

1285
01:50:27,761 --> 01:50:31,202
[SPEAKER_04]: Tufts could just give this to all the students that they house, and that would be fine.

1286
01:50:31,222 --> 01:50:35,083
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be another packet in the many packets of papers that they give to their students.

1287
01:50:37,483 --> 01:50:45,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And secondly, when it comes to off-campus housing, that would be private landlords, and therefore they would be providing this information to their tenants or the other residents.

1288
01:50:47,225 --> 01:50:54,507
[SPEAKER_04]: When students sign an agreement to enter dormitory housing, they sign a specific contract for a specific period that's very different from a standard rental lease.

1289
01:50:56,961 --> 01:50:58,942
[SPEAKER_04]: requirements, penalties and needs around that are different.

1290
01:50:59,142 --> 01:51:12,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, generally you don't see students squatting after, you know, homecoming or, sorry not homecoming, but you know, graduation just to try to uphold their eviction rights for 60 days.

1291
01:51:12,528 --> 01:51:15,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've ever seen that at any university that I've ever been a part of.

1292
01:51:16,090 --> 01:51:23,454
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to the discretion piece, there's nothing in here that says the board of health may do what they want or the health director may do what they want.

1293
01:51:23,514 --> 01:51:25,114
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a common understanding that

1294
01:51:27,689 --> 01:51:38,777
[SPEAKER_04]: any level of government in this country, state, federal, local, the executive branch is the branch that enforces the law and they may enforce that law at their discretion, right?

1295
01:51:38,817 --> 01:51:41,259
[SPEAKER_04]: We see that with a number of things with

1296
01:51:41,775 --> 01:51:50,121
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go from president to president, and some presidents choose to enforce certain parts of the law, and some presidents choose to enforce different parts of the law, and we have lots of debates around that.

1297
01:51:50,922 --> 01:52:01,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to Councilor Collins' point initially, I think that really is the crux of this is we had the conversations about what is this gonna look like, how is it gonna be implemented, and what is the purpose that it's gonna serve?

1298
01:52:02,271 --> 01:52:04,633
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be a document,

1299
01:52:05,818 --> 01:52:14,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Developed can even kind of a modification of existing documents that have been created around the rights of renters and homeowners and their and their housing rights and resources, it's going to be.

1300
01:52:16,058 --> 01:52:29,583
[SPEAKER_04]: created by the city, distributed to property owners, and primarily the goal is to have it be an educational tool to ensure that everyone in the city, whether you're a homeowner or a landlord, a tenant, or anyone else, has a clear picture of what your rights are.

1301
01:52:30,403 --> 01:52:35,785
[SPEAKER_04]: And in terms of the specifics of enforcement, the first violation is a written warning.

1302
01:52:35,945 --> 01:52:38,346
[SPEAKER_04]: The second violation is the fine that you noted.

1303
01:52:38,906 --> 01:52:41,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Pursuant to Chapter 40, Section 21D of Mass General Law,

1304
01:52:43,249 --> 01:52:51,901
[SPEAKER_04]: And even more so than that I did a fine per incident not a fine per day so it wouldn't be $300 a day would be if someone.

1305
01:52:52,842 --> 01:52:58,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, the intent here, both the intent of us and the intent of the administration that we worked with is that this is not just

1306
01:52:59,176 --> 01:53:12,520
[SPEAKER_04]: know, going around and finding people willy nilly, it's trying to get folks to provide the relevant legal information to everyone who has housing in the city so that they can better understand what their options are in any situation.

1307
01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:20,042
[SPEAKER_04]: But in any case, the way that it would be implemented, or the way that the enforcement structure is written,

1308
01:53:20,993 --> 01:53:33,527
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm a landlord and I didn't provide my tenant this information, and I was then told about the existence of this ordinance, and then I started providing the information, that wouldn't be an issue.

1309
01:53:33,567 --> 01:53:41,577
[SPEAKER_04]: If I didn't provide the information, was told about the ordinance, and then continued on to provide the information for whatever reason, then I could be given a written warning.

1310
01:53:42,299 --> 01:53:52,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if I didn't provide it to a tenant on the inception or the termination of a tenancy or a lease, then I would be fined $300 one time, not $300 a day until I provided the information.

1311
01:53:52,565 --> 01:53:52,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1312
01:53:53,306 --> 01:53:54,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1313
01:53:54,566 --> 01:53:55,447
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the way I read it.

1314
01:53:55,467 --> 01:53:57,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

1315
01:53:57,108 --> 01:54:11,537
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, not to disrespect my fellow councilors that are speaking on this issue, but again, the intent of law and the understanding, we do not have anyone behind this rail that's an attorney.

1316
01:54:12,668 --> 01:54:18,172
[SPEAKER_07]: which poses another issue and concern that we have with a lack of this.

1317
01:54:18,852 --> 01:54:36,645
[SPEAKER_07]: And like I said, I'll say it again, most communities is there's representation for the council that's present with us that you can call the podium and ask these questions to make sure we're protecting us, the fiscal responsibilities of the community and our laws.

1318
01:54:37,125 --> 01:54:38,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, it just,

1319
01:54:40,310 --> 01:54:51,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that people, my frustration comes in understanding how serious this is without not having legal representation as we move forward with these ordinances.

1320
01:54:51,941 --> 01:54:53,783
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, just something I needed to share.

1321
01:54:54,443 --> 01:54:54,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1322
01:55:00,680 --> 01:55:00,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1323
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:07,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you President well, um, for me this is pretty straightforward.

1324
01:55:07,342 --> 01:55:13,944
[SPEAKER_13]: I look at the housing stability and the vision ordinance I see something that has generated support from different parts of town.

1325
01:55:14,865 --> 01:55:18,766
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is fundamentally, fundamentally about transparent and helpful governance.

1326
01:55:20,167 --> 01:55:24,930
[SPEAKER_13]: And the idea that we're all better off when we know what our rights are and we know what resources we have access to.

1327
01:55:26,311 --> 01:55:33,036
[SPEAKER_13]: Access to information can be hard, especially to those who don't know who to ask for resources, where to look for information.

1328
01:55:33,056 --> 01:55:47,146
[SPEAKER_13]: And some people who might fall into those buckets are older folks who might not be internet savvy, immigrants who might not speak English, and people who just moved to Medford or have moved to Massachusetts for the first time and they don't really know what

1329
01:55:48,626 --> 01:55:49,807
[SPEAKER_13]: how our institutions work here.

1330
01:55:51,107 --> 01:56:02,970
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to commend the people who've put so much work into writing this ordinance for making sure that it meets our goals when it comes to equity in housing.

1331
01:56:03,390 --> 01:56:06,831
[SPEAKER_13]: There's language in here that talks about language access.

1332
01:56:06,891 --> 01:56:11,952
[SPEAKER_13]: There's language in here that really addresses print versus digital media.

1333
01:56:12,452 --> 01:56:14,273
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's,

1334
01:56:14,933 --> 01:56:28,640
[SPEAKER_13]: This is one of those kind of pieces of legislation that we have in front of us that has, I think, a newer perspective on how we can solve these long lasting challenges.

1335
01:56:29,621 --> 01:56:30,601
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's also important to

1336
01:56:31,902 --> 01:56:36,506
[SPEAKER_13]: to state again that our city staff have been supporting us the whole way with this.

1337
01:56:37,066 --> 01:56:38,707
[SPEAKER_13]: They know that we have the ability to do this.

1338
01:56:38,747 --> 01:56:40,128
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have the ability to do this.

1339
01:56:40,729 --> 01:56:47,874
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have the ability to build a fair economy in the housing market where we do look out for the little guy.

1340
01:56:47,994 --> 01:56:50,736
[SPEAKER_13]: And we look out for tenants.

1341
01:56:50,776 --> 01:56:56,901
[SPEAKER_13]: We look out for the tenant landlord relationship and for people being foreclosed upon.

1342
01:56:58,124 --> 01:56:58,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1343
01:56:59,625 --> 01:57:00,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Any further discussion from the Council?

1344
01:57:01,325 --> 01:57:08,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, Madam President, if it's about transparency, right, and it's about making sure that people are aware of something, then why are we attaching a punitive measure to it, right?

1345
01:57:08,968 --> 01:57:10,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are we attaching a fine at the end of it?

1346
01:57:12,022 --> 01:57:15,285
[SPEAKER_08]: if it's about transparency and it's about making sure that people have knowledge, right?

1347
01:57:15,585 --> 01:57:21,831
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is always an excuse when it comes up to something, this is some reason why the people aren't competent enough to pursue what it is they need to pursue.

1348
01:57:21,871 --> 01:57:23,572
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always a reason we're trying to pass something.

1349
01:57:23,592 --> 01:57:24,934
[SPEAKER_08]: What about the person that doesn't have internet?

1350
01:57:24,974 --> 01:57:28,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that one person, like, come on, it's 2023, the internet is everywhere.

1351
01:57:28,997 --> 01:57:29,878
[SPEAKER_08]: They're giving phones away.

1352
01:57:31,339 --> 01:57:33,240
[SPEAKER_08]: You walk into the store, they're giving you a phone for free.

1353
01:57:33,640 --> 01:57:34,060
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

1354
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:34,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

1355
01:57:34,461 --> 01:57:35,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody has access to the internet.

1356
01:57:35,761 --> 01:57:38,583
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, there's plenty of places to access the internet, number one, number two.

1357
01:57:38,603 --> 01:57:42,806
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't think that we give the general populace enough credit sometimes.

1358
01:57:43,827 --> 01:57:46,368
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we don't give the general populace enough credit sometimes.

1359
01:57:47,529 --> 01:57:54,533
[SPEAKER_08]: But with that being said, I'd motion to strike the fine from $300 to $50, and then I'll move for approval.

1360
01:57:54,553 --> 01:57:57,475
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a motion from Councilor Collins.

1361
01:57:57,775 --> 01:57:58,556
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we take those separately?

1362
01:57:59,743 --> 01:58:04,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, do you have a, um, would you sever?

1363
01:58:04,047 --> 01:58:07,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you asking to sever or would you sever those two?

1364
01:58:07,209 --> 01:58:07,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight?

1365
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:11,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm going to, I mean, I'm making the motion to make it 50 bucks.

1366
01:58:11,433 --> 01:58:13,674
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if it passes, I'll move for approval.

1367
01:58:13,915 --> 01:58:18,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a motion from Councilor Knight to adjust the, um, fine to $50.

1368
01:58:19,539 --> 01:58:19,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1369
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:21,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Vice President Bears.

1370
01:58:22,462 --> 01:58:24,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1371
01:58:24,924 --> 01:58:26,285
[SPEAKER_04]: If I may add the motion.

1372
01:58:26,845 --> 01:58:28,527
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor, uh, Vice President Bears.

1373
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:31,842
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason there's a fine is that there.

1374
01:58:33,143 --> 01:58:39,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, if no one if people don't do it and the city doesn't have any authority to further ask them to do it.

1375
01:58:40,390 --> 01:58:51,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind if we reduce the fine, but also if we find out because the finest so is that an amount that is not sufficient to convince a property owner to otherwise follow the law.

1376
01:58:52,486 --> 01:58:53,627
[SPEAKER_04]: then I think we'd have to revisit that.

1377
01:58:53,947 --> 01:58:55,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm fine, we'll test it out at 50.

1378
01:58:55,688 --> 01:59:08,318
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, again, as we said, the intent was educational and my understanding is that at least on the first pass and probably multiple passes of going through the property on our list and asking them to submit this, the Board of Health won't issue fines at all.

1379
01:59:08,578 --> 01:59:20,447
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I think if we come back here and find out, we hear from the Board of Health, well, there's 200 problem properties in the city that aren't gonna issue this because they'll pay 50 bucks and they have an objection to it, then we may have to come back and revisit it.

1380
01:59:21,292 --> 01:59:26,193
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, ultimately what we're doing is we're asking the landlord to give a piece of paper that the city puts together to the tenant.

1381
01:59:26,793 --> 01:59:28,494
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna charge them 300 bucks if they don't do that.

1382
01:59:28,634 --> 01:59:29,494
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little much.

1383
01:59:29,854 --> 01:59:33,815
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little crazy, but I support the, I appreciate the council's second on the motion.

1384
01:59:35,035 --> 01:59:39,996
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to strike the $300 and change it to 50, seconded by Vice President Ferris.

1385
01:59:40,036 --> 01:59:45,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1386
01:59:45,137 --> 01:59:48,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Ferris.

1387
01:59:50,855 --> 01:59:51,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1388
01:59:52,816 --> 01:59:55,858
Yes.

1389
01:59:58,439 --> 01:59:58,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1390
01:59:59,499 --> 02:00:01,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1391
02:00:02,041 --> 02:00:04,142
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1392
02:00:04,322 --> 02:00:04,482
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1393
02:00:05,262 --> 02:00:07,203
[SPEAKER_02]: For me for three and a motion passes.

1394
02:00:09,505 --> 02:00:11,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice Councilor Knight.

1395
02:00:11,305 --> 02:00:13,246
[SPEAKER_08]: One more moment of motion to exempt Tufts University.

1396
02:00:15,227 --> 02:00:18,309
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to accept Tufts University on campus housing University.

1397
02:00:19,577 --> 02:00:22,979
[SPEAKER_02]: on-campus housing, so Tufts-owned on-campus housing, motion to exempt?

1398
02:00:23,839 --> 02:00:25,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Under B-5, I guess it would be.

1399
02:00:25,920 --> 02:00:27,681
[SPEAKER_08]: 4933-B-5, new section.

1400
02:00:27,761 --> 02:00:38,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a motion from Councilor Knight to exempt Tufts University's on-campus housing, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1401
02:00:40,228 --> 02:00:40,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call, please.

1402
02:00:51,019 --> 02:00:54,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Collins.

1403
02:00:54,585 --> 02:00:54,926
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1404
02:00:54,946 --> 02:01:02,098
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to note before we take the vote on this Council and I appreciate your amendment and thinking through this on the floor.

1405
02:01:03,847 --> 02:01:16,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Having not considered such an amendment before, I think it's worth putting on the record that as a Tufts alumnus myself, I've seen firsthand, I don't think that this is an ordinance that would be in any way difficult for them to implement.

1406
02:01:16,833 --> 02:01:32,501
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that there is some value for an institution that professes to be a community partner to participate in such an ordinance so that should students move off campus after graduating from Tufts University, like myself, that they are given a headstart in, you know,

1407
02:01:33,281 --> 02:01:40,526
[SPEAKER_10]: like we're talking about being aware of the housing rights and responsibilities and resources that they can expect from their community.

1408
02:01:40,626 --> 02:01:52,794
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know that this is a major point, but I just felt it's worth expressing that I don't think it's going too far to ask a major and wealthy community partner to participate in a good faith ordinance.

1409
02:01:53,094 --> 02:01:53,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1410
02:01:53,374 --> 02:01:55,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Councilor Collins.

1411
02:01:55,856 --> 02:01:57,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have the motion, Mr. Clerk?

1412
02:02:02,597 --> 02:02:09,661
[SPEAKER_02]: So the motion of councilor Knight to exempt tops on campus housing seconded by councilor Caraviello, please call the roll.

1413
02:02:16,386 --> 02:02:16,526
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1414
02:02:16,546 --> 02:02:16,666
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1415
02:02:16,686 --> 02:02:16,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1416
02:02:16,806 --> 02:02:17,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1417
02:02:17,267 --> 02:02:17,387
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1418
02:02:31,061 --> 02:02:31,261
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1419
02:02:32,322 --> 02:02:34,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Three in the affirmative, four in the negative, the motion fails.

1420
02:02:35,823 --> 02:02:36,424
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to approve.

1421
02:02:37,004 --> 02:02:45,447
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to approve as amended by Councilor Knight for first reading, please call the roll.

1422
02:02:52,350 --> 02:02:53,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Peers.

1423
02:02:53,311 --> 02:02:53,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1424
02:02:55,031 --> 02:02:55,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

1425
02:02:55,612 --> 02:02:55,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1426
02:02:57,653 --> 02:02:58,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Collins.

1427
02:02:58,353 --> 02:02:58,553
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1428
02:03:02,377 --> 02:03:02,577
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1429
02:03:04,219 --> 02:03:06,301
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.

1430
02:03:06,621 --> 02:03:06,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1431
02:03:06,861 --> 02:03:06,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1432
02:03:07,022 --> 02:03:08,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1433
02:03:08,523 --> 02:03:09,804
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion passes.

1434
02:03:10,525 --> 02:03:11,506
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the end of our agenda.

1435
02:03:11,606 --> 02:03:12,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Up to public participation.

1436
02:03:13,047 --> 02:03:15,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any members of the public who would like to speak?

1437
02:03:23,805 --> 02:03:24,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address for the record, please.

1438
02:03:24,945 --> 02:03:26,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Steve Schnapp, 36 Hillside Avenue.

1439
02:03:28,467 --> 02:03:34,009
[SPEAKER_11]: I actually wanted to say this about an hour and a half earlier when folks were discussing the post office.

1440
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:43,513
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say, and if there's anybody here who knows the last name of postal carrier Joe in Medford Square,

1441
02:03:45,387 --> 02:03:47,888
[SPEAKER_11]: We get our mail every day, unless he's sick.

1442
02:03:47,948 --> 02:03:51,349
[SPEAKER_11]: And he had surgery, it was out for a while, and the mail was a little slippery.

1443
02:03:51,909 --> 02:03:53,149
[SPEAKER_11]: Came back after surgery.

1444
02:03:53,589 --> 02:03:57,491
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an older gentleman, he's probably gonna retire in a few years.

1445
02:03:58,711 --> 02:03:59,491
[SPEAKER_11]: Not as old as me.

1446
02:04:02,212 --> 02:04:13,535
[SPEAKER_11]: Also remember a couple of weeks ago, when the weather was below zero, and with freezing rain and snow, we were still getting our mail on that day.

1447
02:04:15,267 --> 02:04:26,844
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to put that on the record so folks would know that there are a lot of postal workers who are trying their damnedest and who still believe that the mail should be delivered through snow, rain, ice, et cetera.

1448
02:04:27,686 --> 02:04:28,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1449
02:04:28,146 --> 02:04:28,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1450
02:04:29,803 --> 02:04:30,363
[SPEAKER_02]: President Bears.

1451
02:04:30,443 --> 02:04:40,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to that point, I believe I also saw recently that according to the head of the post office here in Medford, they're down almost a third on their delivery staff right now.

1452
02:04:40,347 --> 02:04:42,027
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's probably the main reason here.

1453
02:04:42,327 --> 02:04:45,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a variety of reasons that could be true.

1454
02:04:45,949 --> 02:04:50,370
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of them is I think that our postal workers are underpaid significantly.

1455
02:04:50,410 --> 02:04:56,933
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that if we maybe should consider a resolution to encourage higher pay for postal workers, and maybe then we'll get

1456
02:04:58,416 --> 02:05:03,957
[SPEAKER_04]: more filling of the openings in our current delivery services, open positions.

1457
02:05:04,097 --> 02:05:04,418
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.
