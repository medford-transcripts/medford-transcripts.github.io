[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hayes?

68
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:06,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a quick question about them.

69
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:10,800
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one that's missing, the vendor number and vendor name.

70
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:16,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what page it's on, Member Hayes?

71
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:18,958
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good question, because they're not numbered.

72
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:26,743
[SPEAKER_06]: It is... It's at the top of page seven?

73
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:29,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I believe that was.

74
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:32,507
[SPEAKER_04]: The amount is the $58,897.

75
00:04:32,547 --> 00:04:35,589
[SPEAKER_04]: It just didn't have a vendor name and a vendor number.

76
00:04:44,013 --> 00:04:47,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Superintendent, do you have any update on this one?

77
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:50,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the question is just what's the vendor name here?

78
00:04:50,315 --> 00:04:51,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Mr. Murphy?

79
00:04:58,154 --> 00:05:11,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so I can look into this further if necessary, but I believe it's a settlement which usually occurs when there's a dispute between a family and a district with respect to services.

80
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:16,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the name would be would remain confidential in this particular report, but

81
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:20,150
[SPEAKER_08]: So I believe that's what that's attributable to.

82
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,411
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will follow up.

83
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:26,074
[SPEAKER_08]: And I won't be able to confirm, obviously, the specifics beyond that.

84
00:05:26,094 --> 00:05:27,855
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you whether or not I'm correct.

85
00:05:28,056 --> 00:05:31,118
[SPEAKER_08]: And I believe that that's what that is.

86
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:31,738
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

87
00:05:31,838 --> 00:05:32,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

88
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:32,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

89
00:05:33,059 --> 00:05:33,700

00:05:36,142 --> 00:05:36,422

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

108
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:06,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

132
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Item number five, report of subcommittees.

133
00:06:57,553 --> 00:07:03,000
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a rules and policy subcommittee minutes from March 30th, 2022.

134
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:06,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rousseau, did you want to give us an update?

135
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:33,101
[SPEAKER_12]: sure thank you um so um what was the date i'm sorry too many windows in my hand uh we met last week um to just the rules thank you the rules policy and equity sub rules and policy uh subcommittee met last week um on the 30th to um address two issues that was sent to the subcommittee uh one was on the attorney policy school attorney policy uh we

136
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:35,762
[SPEAKER_12]: made a lot of progress on that.

137
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:51,108
[SPEAKER_12]: We have one outstanding query that I have to make about one sentence in that, and we'll be bringing that back to the next subcommittee meeting, which will be happening at the end of April, hopefully to finalize that recommendation.

138
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:56,410
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the other, the majority of the meeting was spent on creating address code,

139
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:04,309
[SPEAKER_12]: For the district, and we heard from six members of the community, actually maybe one six sorry.

140
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:20,120
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thought we got some really excellent feedback about what people like and didn't like and really covered a bunch of the areas that we need to take into consideration when crafting a policy.

141
00:08:20,975 --> 00:08:32,322
[SPEAKER_12]: In particular, things such as the vocational school, we wanna make sure to draft a policy that works for their very specific needs.

142
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:34,884
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're having another meeting.

143
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:49,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I don't have the date yet, but the end of April, and we will be reviewing a couple of policies that, well, there was one policy we sort of briefly went over as a potential for our policy language.

144
00:08:49,845 --> 00:08:53,288
[SPEAKER_12]: Since we're not editing an existing policy, we are drafting from scratch.

145
00:08:54,909 --> 00:09:02,855
[SPEAKER_12]: So in that way, it makes more sense to look to other policies rather than starting from nowhere.

146
00:09:03,856 --> 00:09:12,583
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm looking forward to that next meeting where we'll focus on the language of a policy that we hopefully will be able to finish up in that meeting and bring back to the full committee.

147
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:13,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

148
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:17,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

149
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:19,408

210
00:14:39,104 --> 00:14:55,107
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to just recognize that last week we celebrated Women's History Month celebration, and our District Attorney, Dio Ryan, came, and there was a full panel of women leaders from all walks of life,

211
00:14:55,887 --> 00:15:02,429
[SPEAKER_10]: from female state trooper to newscaster to scientists and researchers.

212
00:15:03,489 --> 00:15:07,170
[SPEAKER_10]: The superintendent present company was part of the panel.

213
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,171
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a wonderful celebration hosted by our CCSR students.

214
00:15:13,072 --> 00:15:17,613
[SPEAKER_10]: And the students came and asked wonderful questions and the students were a great audience.

215
00:15:17,673 --> 00:15:21,854
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanna thank our CCSR students for a job well done.

216
00:15:22,474 --> 00:15:26,843
[SPEAKER_10]: and thank all of our panelists who came out to support Medford Public Schools last week.

217
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:33,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I also would like to recognize our Middle School Strings Ensemble.

218
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:36,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Under the direction of Ms.

219
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:42,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Sophia Chang, they received a gold rating this past Sunday.

220
00:15:43,295 --> 00:15:46,957
[SPEAKER_10]: The ensemble received a perfect score on their performance.

221
00:15:47,658 --> 00:15:49,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Such talent in the group.

222
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:54,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations to all of our students for their hard work, and of course to Ms.

223
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:54,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Chang.

224
00:15:56,593 --> 00:16:07,015
[SPEAKER_10]: We'd also like to extend a special thanks to Tufts University for their generous donation of $1,000 to the Medford High School PTO.

225
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:13,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Those monies will be utilized for the junior class up all night party hosted after the prom.

226
00:16:14,156 --> 00:16:25,838
[SPEAKER_10]: We send special appreciation to Mr. Rocco DiRico, who's the executive director of government and community relations for Tufts University, who helped to make this donation possible.

227
00:16:27,438 --> 00:16:34,881
[SPEAKER_10]: We also want to recognize that Ramadan began on April 2nd, and it continues until May 1st.

228
00:16:35,821 --> 00:16:41,943
[SPEAKER_10]: During this time, we extend our wishes of a happy Ramadan Mubarak to all of our Muslim families.

229
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:48,446
[SPEAKER_10]: April 4th through April 8th is also the week of the young child.

230
00:16:50,124 --> 00:16:55,888
[SPEAKER_10]: This means it's a time to recognize that children's opportunities are our responsibilities.

231
00:16:56,508 --> 00:17:09,217
[SPEAKER_10]: And we must commit ourselves to ensuring that each and every child experiences the type of early learning environments at home, at childcare, at school, and in the community.

232
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:13,901
[SPEAKER_10]: All those experiences promote their early learning.

233
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:17,223
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, the focus this week is the week of the young child.

234
00:17:18,864 --> 00:17:22,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Lastly, April is also National Poetry Month.

235
00:17:22,629 --> 00:17:28,157
[SPEAKER_10]: So I will end tonight's remarks with a quote from the American poet laureate, Amanda Gorman.

236
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:34,946
[SPEAKER_10]: If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy.

237
00:17:35,426 --> 00:17:35,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

238
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:39,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

239
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,432
[SPEAKER_06]: I did have one question for you about the middle school math presentation.

240
00:17:43,912 --> 00:17:49,495
[SPEAKER_06]: There were parents asking whether the session would be recorded on Monday evening.

241
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:52,917
[SPEAKER_06]: So for those who can't attend, they can watch it after the fact.

242
00:17:52,997 --> 00:17:55,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that planned or can that be accommodated?

243
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:56,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we can accommodate.

244
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,180
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have Ms.

245
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Khan with us here this evening as well.

246
00:17:59,121 --> 00:17:59,281
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

247
00:17:59,301 --> 00:17:59,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Khan.

248
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:00,402
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

249
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:02,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me here.

250
00:18:02,763 --> 00:18:07,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the intent is to record it and we will have the slide deck also posted.

251
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:09,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect, thank you so much.

252
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Item number two, we have the recommendation to approve adoption of the new elementary math program.

253
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:19,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

254
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:21,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Faiza Khan, the director of mathematics.

255
00:18:22,027 --> 00:18:22,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

256
00:18:23,148 --> 00:18:24,789
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again for having me here.

257
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,382
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the report that me and Mr. Lucey put together.

258
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:39,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just am here to actually propose the adoption of investigations three as our elementary math program.

259
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:41,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Much effort has gone into it.

260
00:18:42,807 --> 00:18:45,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Many stakeholders, in fact, all stakeholders

261
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,571
[SPEAKER_01]: have been involved in the process that started in October of 2019.

262
00:18:52,392 --> 00:19:01,276
[SPEAKER_01]: We went on for good six meetings and then we had to put a halt on the process because we had COVID.

263
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:09,199
[SPEAKER_01]: We put the process on hold for a whole year and then we picked it up back in April of 2021.

264
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:23,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever since then, we have been meeting, we have been meeting with the parents, teachers have been piloting, and we have finally come to the conclusion that using the rubric that we

265
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:37,280
[SPEAKER_01]: the basics from the Achieve the Core Foundation that Investigations III is the program that best fits our students' needs at this point.

266
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:50,912
[SPEAKER_01]: The other two programs, I would say one other competing program was Bridges by the Math Center, almost half of our classrooms that are listed here.

267
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,721
[SPEAKER_01]: piloted that program.

268
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:59,283
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the district was using Envisions 2020.

269
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:03,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Much of the details are here in the report.

270
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Please let me know if you have any questions.

271
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:11,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

272
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:12,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any questions?

273
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:13,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice Chair Graham?

274
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:15,748
[SPEAKER_13]: Member McLaughlin?

275
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:16,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

276
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:17,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

277
00:20:17,672 --> 00:20:18,975
[SPEAKER_13]: to come for the presentation.

278
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:24,668
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just wanted to ask, I know we've talked about this before, but I'm sure you know the question I'm going to ask.

279
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,242
[SPEAKER_13]: special education supplements and differentiation for the math program.

280
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:30,983
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you talk to that a little bit?

281
00:20:31,183 --> 00:20:32,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.

282
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:33,864
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Ms.

283
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:39,247
[SPEAKER_01]: Alison Watts from Brooks School on this committee.

284
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:52,073
[SPEAKER_01]: She piloted it for fourth and the fifth grade, and she found the program to be in one of the best programs that does the differentiation and helps teachers differentiate their

285
00:20:53,173 --> 00:20:57,357
[SPEAKER_01]: education, the content in many ways.

286
00:20:58,077 --> 00:21:02,621
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got all in the rubric.

287
00:21:03,282 --> 00:21:12,590
[SPEAKER_01]: There were questions about if the program is in line with the needs of our English learner population and our students with disabilities.

288
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:20,256
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like it provides a very good scaffolding support and it provides accommodations for

289
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:29,318
[SPEAKER_01]: students on each end, students who can take some challenges and students who we shall be supporting in many ways.

290
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:47,612
[SPEAKER_11]: I think all I would comment on that is that each lesson has three levels of addressing learner needs so that there is the intervention, the differentiation, the practice and the extension so that that's covered in every lesson.

291
00:21:58,822 --> 00:21:59,523
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Edward-Benson?

292
00:21:59,643 --> 00:22:01,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I just wanted to say thank you to Ms.

293
00:22:01,784 --> 00:22:09,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Kahn and to all the teachers that, and the parents that were involved in this truly collaborative process.

294
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:23,362
[SPEAKER_10]: It took a very long time, but I know with all of the teachers, whether they were piloting bridges, using the envisions or piloting investigations that it was a lot of work for them to pilot it.

295
00:22:23,482 --> 00:22:25,683
[SPEAKER_10]: But I truly feel like this was a,

296
00:22:27,004 --> 00:22:49,257
[SPEAKER_10]: a truly collaborative process that working together they came and made this decision and i look forward to seeing how the district does with investigations three knowing that so many voices were able to contribute to the final decision so thank you for all your hard work regarding that thank you thank you and i i am truly grateful to all the teachers it was a it was a

297
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:56,485
[SPEAKER_01]: tough year and to all the parents who made time to meet and to visit the classroom.

298
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:59,967
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you to anybody who was involved in this process.

299
00:23:01,348 --> 00:23:01,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Member Rousseau.

300
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:03,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, thank you.

301
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to thank everybody involved in this process.

302
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:11,435
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that it was having a process just getting going and then having it derailed

303
00:23:12,127 --> 00:23:14,569
[SPEAKER_12]: can make it a lot harder to get back to where you were.

304
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:23,214
[SPEAKER_12]: I do just, I want to mention that school committees are explicitly forbidden from selecting curriculum.

305
00:23:23,294 --> 00:23:26,516
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would just ask that we actually not take a vote to approve or not.

306
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:31,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously it should be in the budget, but I think that there's a precedent issue here.

307
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:38,063
[SPEAKER_12]: If we approve this, the next curriculum somebody else comes forward with, if we disagree with it,

308
00:23:39,744 --> 00:23:47,708
[SPEAKER_12]: it would be awkward for us to either not be asked to approve it or to not approve it when in fact we don't have authority in that regard.

309
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:50,249
[SPEAKER_12]: So I would just ask that we not take any vote.

310
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:55,312
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very supportive of this, but that's not our authority.

311
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,412
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's just my opinion.

312
00:23:56,612 --> 00:23:56,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

313
00:23:58,833 --> 00:23:59,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham.

314
00:24:01,355 --> 00:24:02,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

315
00:24:02,627 --> 00:24:02,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

316
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:16,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Member Russo, if you wouldn't mind sharing that information with us from the MASC, I think it would be really good to see, because I actually just received some varying information over the weekend about curriculum in another arena from DESE.

317
00:24:16,938 --> 00:24:19,319
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you could share with us, that would be really great.

318
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:19,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

319
00:24:23,153 --> 00:24:26,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a couple of questions for you from the chair.

320
00:24:28,838 --> 00:24:32,460
[SPEAKER_06]: You mentioned that there were parents involved in the process.

321
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you talk a little bit about how they were involved in the process?

322
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:36,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

323
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:44,269
[SPEAKER_01]: So because the teachers are in the classroom, those teachers were in the committee first.

324
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:48,772
[SPEAKER_01]: We are the ones who started with them from October, 2019.

325
00:24:50,133 --> 00:25:02,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Parents got involved, I would say, much later in the process, which is almost when the programs were being piloted in the classrooms.

326
00:25:02,344 --> 00:25:05,607
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason behind that was that the teachers had a

327
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:21,084
[SPEAKER_01]: I had gotten a chance to take a look at the five different six different programs and got a chance to narrow it down to two or three, based on some basic rubric, and we went from there so.

328
00:25:22,406 --> 00:25:29,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Once parents were involved, there were four meetings that I held with them of about an hour and a half each.

329
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:44,766
[SPEAKER_01]: They looked at a couple of surveys that I had sent out to the teachers, which was based on the rubric, so they knew how the process is going in the classrooms, how each program is being ranked by the teachers.

330
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:58,337
[SPEAKER_01]: We also talked about how learning mathematics learning has shifted in the most recent years and and that's how the process actually started with our.

331
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:02,169
[SPEAKER_01]: educators who were in the committee as well.

332
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,632
[SPEAKER_01]: The parents brought a wealth of information.

333
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:07,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned a lot from them.

334
00:26:08,194 --> 00:26:16,421
[SPEAKER_01]: They put me in touch with some of their either colleagues or their acquaintances in other districts.

335
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,042
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a chance to talk to the

336
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:26,502
[SPEAKER_01]: the educators and the superintendents from other districts as well.

337
00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:33,206
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really beneficial for me personally and professionally.

338
00:26:33,347 --> 00:26:42,073
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also made sure that I took the discussions that took place with the parents back to the teachers in the committee.

339
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how we worked it all out.

340
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:49,378
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end, teachers are the one who filled out the rubric.

341
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,681
[SPEAKER_01]: and decided for investigations three.

342
00:26:56,022 --> 00:27:02,447
[SPEAKER_06]: And can you talk to us a little bit about what the rubric contained, like what were the factors they were looking for in the rubric and

343
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:28,715
[SPEAKER_06]: yes that this prevailed it was it like overwhelming majority was in agreement this way and the reason i ask is because when we started this conversation we talked about ed reports as being sort of a jumping off point and the investigations curriculum does not fare as well in ed reports as bridges does so i'm just curious which what there's no like red stop signs anywhere but i'm just curious

344
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:32,697
[SPEAKER_06]: what the, like how we sort of progress through the logic.

345
00:27:32,738 --> 00:27:38,387
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for people who are really interested in improving the math instruction, that would be helpful to know.

346
00:27:38,853 --> 00:27:43,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so our rubric had eight different pieces in it.

347
00:27:43,517 --> 00:27:46,440
[SPEAKER_01]: It started with curriculum, with instruction.

348
00:27:47,021 --> 00:27:49,123
[SPEAKER_01]: It also had professional development in it.

349
00:27:49,303 --> 00:27:51,965
[SPEAKER_01]: It had the implementation of ease in it.

350
00:27:52,065 --> 00:28:00,093
[SPEAKER_01]: It had technology in it, and it had supports for our vetting population in it.

351
00:28:00,313 --> 00:28:02,115
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give you the exact eight of them.

352
00:28:03,076 --> 00:28:07,880
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was shared with the teachers and of course the parents.

353
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:14,505
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody was aware of what is being looked at in the rubric.

354
00:28:14,545 --> 00:28:20,390
[SPEAKER_01]: The survey that was sent out twice, it was the same survey and it had 11 questions on it.

355
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:24,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically one question, main question from the rubric

356
00:28:26,368 --> 00:28:35,295
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we added three more to make sure that it covers certain aspects of that rubric much in detail.

357
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:50,086
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as Ed Reports is concerned, we did ask investigations as to why it's not ranked where we would like to see it.

358
00:28:50,966 --> 00:28:52,067
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wrote back to us.

359
00:28:53,657 --> 00:28:58,100
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was, what were the ed reports findings for investigations three?

360
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,264
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said that all grade levels K through five met the expectation for rigor and balance.

361
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:15,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Grades K, one, two, and five were found to meet and grades three and four were viewed as partially meet the expectations for focus and coherence.

362
00:29:15,953 --> 00:29:20,596
[SPEAKER_01]: All grade levels K through five were found to partially meet expectations for the practice.

363
00:29:21,777 --> 00:29:26,601
[SPEAKER_01]: standards and making connections to the content standards.

364
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:36,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have replied back in a full report, whereas they have given the reasons for how ed reports gave them

365
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:51,900
[SPEAKER_01]: initial reviews and they haven't gotten to the second round just yet or that investigations had put in a question there that in a certain grade level that belonged to a grade level that was much higher.

366
00:29:52,541 --> 00:30:01,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they just report wants to make sure it's meeting the criteria for that particular grade level, not the grade level higher.

367
00:30:02,746 --> 00:30:07,228
[SPEAKER_01]: in certain ways they did not pass the test.

368
00:30:07,928 --> 00:30:16,212
[SPEAKER_01]: I did ask the same question and I'm happy to share this report with any member who is interested.

369
00:30:17,152 --> 00:30:22,795
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked the same question from the surrounding districts that have adopted investigations.

370
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:30,198
[SPEAKER_01]: They include Brookline, they include Newton, Wellesley, Boston and Cambridge's piloting.

371
00:30:30,857 --> 00:30:31,377
[SPEAKER_01]: currently.

372
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:41,964
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all said that they were not concerned about this piece because they found it to be a program that was very much in line with problem solving.

373
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:54,692
[SPEAKER_01]: It fit the needs of most educators and that it was a program that was much in line with

374
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,241
[SPEAKER_01]: their middle school program, which is in most cases illustrative mathematics.

375
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:03,302
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

376
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:06,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any other questions for Ms.

377
00:31:07,383 --> 00:31:07,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Khan?

378
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:14,405
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

379
00:31:17,304 --> 00:31:21,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Number three, we have overview of summer programming opportunities at Medford Public Schools.

380
00:31:22,593 --> 00:31:22,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

381
00:31:22,794 --> 00:31:28,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Suzanne Galussi, assistant superintendent of elementary, and Dr. Peter Cushing, the assistant superintendent of secondary.

382
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:38,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

383
00:31:38,544 --> 00:31:39,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

384
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:48,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Cushing and I are just going to present an overview of some of the summer programs that we're looking at in the process of planning.

385
00:31:48,368 --> 00:32:00,273
[SPEAKER_11]: These are not the final detailed plans because they're still in progress, but we're here to just highlight some of the planning that's going on right now and are more than welcome to answer your questions at the end of the presentation.

386
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:07,281
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to start off with Summer Fun as well as a new opportunity.

387
00:32:07,341 --> 00:32:11,023
[SPEAKER_11]: So Summer Fun is an annual tradition here in Medford Public Schools.

388
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:13,585
[SPEAKER_11]: It's part of the community schools.

389
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:14,205
[SPEAKER_11]: It's back.

390
00:32:14,665 --> 00:32:23,089
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going to, it was very successful at the Missituck last year in its combination partnership use with the Tufts Pool.

391
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:30,533
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to have Summer Fun back at the Missituck this year with the adjoining Columbus Park.

392
00:32:31,385 --> 00:32:35,347
[SPEAKER_11]: in the air-conditioned facility, it makes for a really nice place for summer fun.

393
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:48,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Summer fun offers various activities for children ages five to 11, including arts and crafts, sports-related activities, academic-based activities, and of course, as I mentioned, swimming.

394
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:50,714
[SPEAKER_11]: The flyer went out last week.

395
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:57,517
[SPEAKER_11]: The director, Mr. Anthony Petrellis, fifth-grade teacher at the McGlynn Elementary School, is back, and so he sent out all of that information.

396
00:32:57,922 --> 00:33:01,645
[SPEAKER_11]: We do have it here hyperlinked for you, but it did go out to families.

397
00:33:02,085 --> 00:33:06,008
[SPEAKER_11]: It will begin on July 5th and end on August 12th.

398
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:25,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Something that's new this year that we're kind of testing out a little bit, there was this outside organization called Kids to Pros, and they reached out to Mr. Maloney in community schools with an opportunity looking to rent one of our buildings for their enrichment summer camp opportunities.

399
00:33:26,608 --> 00:33:39,450
[SPEAKER_11]: The way they structure their camps are they provide families the opportunity for students to select like theme-based activities in the areas of either STEM, sports, or art.

400
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:55,933
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going to kind of trial this to see how this program's offerings could maybe support the families of Medford and or inform our offerings for summer fun, which is why we're just going to rent the Brooks School and

401
00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:09,192
[SPEAKER_11]: If you look at the dates from July 5th to August 5th, so just about a month for us to kind of get to know the organization and learn a little bit more about the offerings to see how it could enhance our current programs.

402
00:34:10,093 --> 00:34:18,222
[SPEAKER_11]: More information will be shared with families in terms of enrollment if they so wish to participate in this opportunity.

403
00:34:21,715 --> 00:34:23,576
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I apologize.

404
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:30,797
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford Public Schools Special Education Services will be offering the extended school year services there for our students.

405
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:40,520
[SPEAKER_09]: The first program is six weeks from July 5th through August 12th, and it includes 29 days, and that'll be at the Roberts and Medford High School.

406
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Four-week program runs from July 11th through August 5th.

407
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:49,385
[SPEAKER_09]: at the Roberts and the Medford High School as well.

408
00:34:49,865 --> 00:34:56,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Four-week MEEP and language-based programs will be running from July 12th through August 4th.

409
00:34:56,731 --> 00:35:01,215
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday for 12 days throughout the summer and specifically at the Roberts.

410
00:35:01,755 --> 00:35:07,240
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the tutoring program running at the Missittuc three days a week as well, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

411
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,485
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the ESY program directors are Kim Clinton and Julie Santos.

412
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:24,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Families will be contacted in the next couple of weeks, and information will be provided specifically to those families for extended school year services.

413
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

414
00:35:27,631 --> 00:35:40,639
[SPEAKER_11]: And per Mr. Teixeira, for the English language learner opportunities this summer, the first one, the EL students were offered this wonderful opportunity pre-pandemic, and so it's back this year.

415
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,381
[SPEAKER_11]: And the STARBASE, which is a STEM

416
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:53,714
[SPEAKER_11]: related camp for students in grades six and seven will be able to participate in this program from June 27th to July 1st.

417
00:35:54,355 --> 00:36:04,699
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll see that it is at Hanscom Air Force Base and Medford Public Schools will be transporting the students that participate in that camp so that the transportation is on the district.

418
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,021
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a free camp, but students are able to engage in STEM related activities.

419
00:36:09,101 --> 00:36:10,542
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a wonderful, wonderful opportunity.

420
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:19,439
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the following are English language learners enrichment and or assistance for over the summer.

421
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:29,606
[SPEAKER_11]: You'll see that he has broken it up into three levels for the dates for elementary students, middle school students, and high school students throughout the summer for the month of July.

422
00:36:29,626 --> 00:36:38,512
[SPEAKER_11]: He does, he is very clear that the EL enrichment programs are dependent upon the hiring of certified ESL teachers.

423
00:36:42,154 --> 00:36:42,935
[SPEAKER_11]: And on the next one too.

424
00:36:43,615 --> 00:37:08,673
[SPEAKER_11]: And so in looking at starting next year off and helping some students transition academically to the next school year, one of the things that I'm in the process of planning right now with staff is for some, as I'm calling it right now, but step up to academics opportunities to go over reading and math skills in the month of August.

425
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:10,634
[SPEAKER_11]: So this way,

426
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:18,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Our teachers and our students will have July to enjoy and rest and recuperate.

427
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:30,729
[SPEAKER_11]: And for those two weeks where the camps have ended and we're transitioning to start the new school year in August, we're looking to have some academic step-up opportunities for students in grades one through five.

428
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:41,095
[SPEAKER_11]: And so what we're looking at right now is having those be probably about 90 minute sessions, two to three times a week, where students would come to their respective schools

429
00:37:42,098 --> 00:37:45,923
[SPEAKER_11]: and have some skill-based instruction in reading and in math.

430
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:56,057
[SPEAKER_11]: As I said, we're in the planning stages still, so I'll have more finalized information for you a little, probably next month when we send it out to families.

431
00:37:59,565 --> 00:38:11,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, so last summer, uh, department elementary and secondary education provided significant grants, uh, to certain districts, uh, based on, uh, performance in secondary math.

432
00:38:12,394 --> 00:38:18,238
[SPEAKER_09]: And so right now we have no idea if this grant is going to be presented to us again.

433
00:38:18,258 --> 00:38:23,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but there's a high likelihood given that we were offered one for April vacation.

434
00:38:24,082 --> 00:38:31,050
[SPEAKER_09]: that families were notified of today so that they have time to plan, prepare, and get their students ready.

435
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:36,056
[SPEAKER_09]: We highly anticipate that DESE will make these available.

436
00:38:36,276 --> 00:38:42,603
[SPEAKER_09]: The acceleration camps and acceleration academies have been a hallmark of DESE's work over the past year and a half.

437
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:46,290
[SPEAKER_09]: And we definitely feel that they will be returning.

438
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:55,520
[SPEAKER_09]: If not, we'll look to see what we can do to stand up our own academy with available resources through the state and federal grants.

439
00:38:56,408 --> 00:39:05,075
[SPEAKER_09]: It may not be as robust as the ones that DESE provides because they're providing tremendous resources, but we will do the best that we can.

440
00:39:05,235 --> 00:39:09,598
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're looking at focusing on our rising grade eight and rising grade 10 students.

441
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:15,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Staffing last year was four middle school math teachers and three high school math teachers.

442
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:19,405
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually had a last minute shift based on the number of students who are coming in.

443
00:39:20,266 --> 00:39:24,109
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the focus will be focused on specific standards acceleration.

444
00:39:24,765 --> 00:39:38,373
[SPEAKER_09]: through looking at math growth assessments, looking at what students have been doing throughout the year, and where we best need to support them through these types of math acceleration camps.

445
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:41,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, at the secondary level,

446
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:49,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we're looking in the planning stages of academic skills, similarly, uh, to the elementary 90 minute or half day sessions.

447
00:39:50,382 --> 00:39:57,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Want to make sure that we get kids in, get a flavor, get a taste of getting back into school in late August or mid August to late August.

448
00:39:58,328 --> 00:40:10,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and really focusing on a steam type camp, uh, to really bring in the arts, uh, as well as those normal STEM activities, but try to find ways to engage students across various disciplines.

449
00:40:11,373 --> 00:40:20,096
[SPEAKER_09]: and to give them some skill building without it specifically being focused on reading and math in particular, but trying to really help support students.

450
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:28,183
[SPEAKER_09]: We're also looking to bring back the Medford Vocational Technical High School Summer Discovery Vocational Program, which is specifically focused on grades six through eight.

451
00:40:29,544 --> 00:40:41,293
[SPEAKER_09]: This program is heavily dependent on teacher availability, which vocational shops are able to run, and then credit recovery at Medford High School, which is the traditional summer school.

452
00:40:42,193 --> 00:40:49,297
[SPEAKER_09]: that we've spoken about frequently, but to give the dates, we'll run Monday, June 27th through Friday, August 12th.

453
00:40:50,037 --> 00:40:58,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Our snow days this year pushed us about a week later than we would normally be, or I shouldn't say normally, a week later than we were last year.

454
00:40:58,981 --> 00:41:02,343
[SPEAKER_09]: We will have off the four-day weekend around July 4th.

455
00:41:02,803 --> 00:41:07,205
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the first ever last year, and it seemed to work well for families and educators as well.

456
00:41:07,783 --> 00:41:12,846
[SPEAKER_09]: We hope to have license to MPS educators, but we will expand as necessary.

457
00:41:13,286 --> 00:41:16,668
[SPEAKER_09]: And we also added a counselor last year.

458
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:19,269
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll maintain that for this year as well.

459
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:23,191
[SPEAKER_09]: And detailed information is being shared with families.

460
00:41:24,091 --> 00:41:34,657
[SPEAKER_09]: That process is starting so that there's an early opportunity for families to know, or perhaps a course correction as has been discussed previously.

461
00:41:38,921 --> 00:41:50,297
[SPEAKER_11]: And as this committee knows, we started Camp Mustang in the height of the pandemic as a way to keep students anchored to their school buildings and to make sure that we kept that focus on the social emotional needs of our students.

462
00:41:50,938 --> 00:41:55,405
[SPEAKER_11]: So this year we've kind of called it Camp Mustang 2.0 just because we're trying to

463
00:41:56,373 --> 00:41:59,456
[SPEAKER_11]: keep current with the needs and the demands of our students.

464
00:41:59,556 --> 00:42:08,345
[SPEAKER_11]: So the format of Camp Mustang 2.0 during the February and April vacation seems to be quite successful.

465
00:42:08,805 --> 00:42:13,250
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of enrollment right now for the April vacation as well.

466
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:29,852
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think what we would like to do in order to plan thoughtfully and meaningfully for camp Mustang in August is for the participating families that took place in camp Mustang for February vacation and April vacation will be sending out a survey.

467
00:42:30,713 --> 00:42:45,744
[SPEAKER_11]: to elicit some feedback based on the format, student satisfaction, the program that we offered, just so that we can use that feedback to guide our plans for the August Camp Mustang format.

468
00:42:46,544 --> 00:42:51,428
[SPEAKER_11]: So there'll be more information on that once the survey is sent out, and we'll keep you updated.

469
00:42:54,382 --> 00:43:03,390
[SPEAKER_09]: So last year, the music program started their first ever, to my knowledge, summer instrumental music camp.

470
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:22,305
[SPEAKER_09]: This was done out of the fact that instrumental music had taken such a hit during the pandemic, with really prohibitive restrictions for spacing, for using wind instruments, for singing, all those types of things really were prohibited during the height of the pandemic.

471
00:43:23,223 --> 00:43:28,112
[SPEAKER_09]: And this camp was extremely well received by the educators who put it on.

472
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:32,029
[SPEAKER_09]: and by the students and families who chose to attend.

473
00:43:32,449 --> 00:43:41,454
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're extremely excited to be able to offer this two-week instrumental camp and supporting students in the rising grades four through eight.

474
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:53,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Students strengthen their music skills and really were able to focus on rhythm, sight reading, music reading is a critical skill for students in this area, and instrumental terminology.

475
00:43:55,147 --> 00:43:59,549
[SPEAKER_09]: There are other programs that are also being offered through the Medford community schools.

476
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:04,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, right now a filmmakers collaborative is working on finalizing their application.

477
00:44:04,872 --> 00:44:09,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, Celtics basketball camp that ran last year, uh, will run again.

478
00:44:09,395 --> 00:44:15,958
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford basketball camp run by the Medford, uh, boys basketball coach will also be running.

479
00:44:16,419 --> 00:44:19,040
[SPEAKER_09]: We're adding a Medford high school volleyball camp.

480
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:30,049
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, as well, uh, the friends of the fells, uh, I want to thank Marilonga current for connecting us to make sure that that program will also be returning to Medford high school this year.

481
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:36,595
[SPEAKER_09]: And they will be using, uh, the facility at the, uh, at Medford high school to be able to launch their camp as well.

482
00:44:37,316 --> 00:44:45,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and we're in the initial planning, uh, by initial, I mean quite literally just started having this conversation last week around a cheer camp,

483
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:58,737
[SPEAKER_09]: and seeing what we can offer for the youth of Medford, where it seems that our feeder programs for cheer at the high school are not as robust as they once were.

484
00:44:58,977 --> 00:45:03,460
[SPEAKER_09]: So what can we offer around a cheer camp for students here?

485
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:08,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll be sharing out information as it becomes available.

486
00:45:09,724 --> 00:45:13,807
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the end of our slide deck and happy to take any questions you might have.

487
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:16,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau.

488
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:18,949
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

489
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:20,891
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a lot there.

490
00:45:20,911 --> 00:45:24,715
[SPEAKER_12]: I noticed this.

491
00:45:24,915 --> 00:45:29,540
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a focus on the summer for the summer stuff for the rising 10th graders.

492
00:45:30,881 --> 00:45:32,203
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you just tell me, you know,

493
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:37,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Desi apparently feels like these rising 11th and 12th graders don't need anything.

494
00:45:38,545 --> 00:45:43,909
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm assuming we have a good number of rising, we don't have the MCAS results yet.

495
00:45:44,029 --> 00:45:52,116
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm gonna go out on a limb and bet we have a number of rising 11th and 12th graders who still have not passed their MCAS competencies.

496
00:45:53,678 --> 00:45:55,739
[SPEAKER_12]: Pardon me, I hope that was not really loud.

497
00:45:57,994 --> 00:46:02,647
[SPEAKER_12]: Since we're not offering any camps for them, what are we doing for those kids?

498
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:07,364
[SPEAKER_09]: So we actually may consider doing that.

499
00:46:07,745 --> 00:46:13,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, you bring up a very good point about the fact that the grant opportunities only cover 10th grade.

500
00:46:13,669 --> 00:46:16,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but it is something that we can look into and consider.

501
00:46:16,611 --> 00:46:27,539
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say that last year, um, we have not had this problem for the April vacation math acceleration Academy, but last summer we did have a staffing

502
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,082
[SPEAKER_09]: challenges to stand up the math acceleration academies.

503
00:46:33,222 --> 00:46:38,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that there are our teachers and educators are working tremendously hard.

504
00:46:39,145 --> 00:46:41,046
[SPEAKER_09]: They are doing yeoman's work.

505
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:44,087
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think honestly, there's there's

506
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:57,398
[SPEAKER_09]: sometimes there's not enough money to offer people, um, to be able to say, you know, in the summertime to be able to offer, um, enough to be able to, uh, to do that.

507
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:04,684
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can definitely look into it member Rousseau and see what opportunities there are for those students who may need that.

508
00:47:05,084 --> 00:47:14,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I think also too, it may look at, um, we're right now offering an afterschool program for math and an afterschool program for ELA, which will start.

509
00:47:14,595 --> 00:47:16,636
[SPEAKER_09]: which is not directly connected to MCAS.

510
00:47:16,696 --> 00:47:26,320
[SPEAKER_09]: It is simply looking at what the map growth data tells us and how we can best support students outside of the statewide high stakes testing, because I think we need to get away from that narrative.

511
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:42,328
[SPEAKER_09]: And the thought process that I've been having with some of the directors is when, how can we stand these up in the fall to be able to support students as we start the year to support students moving throughout the year, rather than a reactionary phase at the end of the year.

512
00:47:44,052 --> 00:47:46,493
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I just follow up real quick?

513
00:47:47,273 --> 00:47:48,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

514
00:47:49,234 --> 00:48:02,680
[SPEAKER_12]: So the current 10th graders are the first students, the 11th and 12th graders are excluded from having to have passed their competencies to get a diploma, correct?

515
00:48:05,501 --> 00:48:05,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

516
00:48:06,482 --> 00:48:06,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

517
00:48:07,898 --> 00:48:37,230
[SPEAKER_12]: I realized that we won't really know until we get MCAS results this fall or this summer, whether we're talking about, I mean, I don't know what a normal year, how many 10th graders are not going to get a diploma if we don't do something, if it's two or three, but if it's, and I suppose the state is very much waiting, I'm sure Jesse is already feverishly looking at results, and either there's a huge wave of students who they're gonna have to either not give a diploma to after they,

518
00:48:37,694 --> 00:48:42,497
[SPEAKER_12]: get through 12 years of school, or they're going to have to throw out the competency requirement.

519
00:48:43,197 --> 00:48:48,420
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure that will be a front page story for several days.

520
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:53,963
[SPEAKER_12]: But I always want to go on the assumption that DESE won't change their mind.

521
00:48:55,283 --> 00:49:00,286
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if they're not going to change their mind, I just want to make sure we are

522
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:15,537
[SPEAKER_12]: maybe it's a bit cart before the horse since we don't have results, but I'm just very worried about 10th graders that are not going to get a diploma and are we throwing enough resources at them to get them there?

523
00:49:15,637 --> 00:49:18,458
[SPEAKER_12]: So I may be off topic slightly, sorry.

524
00:49:19,899 --> 00:49:21,039
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I don't think you're off topic.

525
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:26,181
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you bring up a thing for us to consider and to look at further.

526
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:32,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say just one other thing though, that throughout a student's 11th and 12th grade years,

527
00:49:32,714 --> 00:49:52,405
[SPEAKER_09]: There are multiple opportunities to demonstrate competency that are presented, and there are opportunities for the school to submit appeals and do a number of things so that the number of students who actually don't receive a diploma is not as high as one may think.

528
00:49:59,209 --> 00:50:00,189
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any other questions?

529
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Hayes?

530
00:50:02,448 --> 00:50:06,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, this is a great list of, there's a lot of things to do this summer, it's wonderful.

531
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:32,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering if it's possible to go through and let us know, besides the one, the really cool sounding Starbase that you said was free, can you talk about which kind of the general, not specific cost, but which of these might be either free, it would be lovely, or low cost, versus ones like the Fells Camp is wonderful, but it actually is quite expensive.

532
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:36,673
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering which of these might be lower cost, if you know.

533
00:50:37,413 --> 00:50:44,077
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the greater differentiation would be that the camps that are run through community schools probably have an associated cost.

534
00:50:44,798 --> 00:50:49,921
[SPEAKER_11]: And the opportunities that are run through the school side, Metro Public Schools, are free of charge.

535
00:50:50,541 --> 00:51:01,528
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we're talking about the academic base, the Camp Mustang, clearly ESY and what Mr. Paul Teixeira for EL, those are free of cost.

536
00:51:02,238 --> 00:51:10,404
[SPEAKER_11]: summer fun, uh, the camp based ones and the camps that Dr. Cushing spoke about for community schools probably have associated.

537
00:51:10,604 --> 00:51:24,454
[SPEAKER_09]: And generally speaking, um, that all of these programs that run through our school will offer some type of assistance or we'll look at a Medford resident, um, needing assistance over perhaps other, uh, communities residents.

538
00:51:24,935 --> 00:51:29,518
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing is, is that I do want to mention that camp Mustang, um,

539
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:37,458
[SPEAKER_09]: the various academic academies outside of the EL and the ESY and the credit recovery.

540
00:51:38,018 --> 00:51:45,962
[SPEAKER_09]: We're able to do that because of the federal and state COVID relief monies that are available to us at this time.

541
00:51:46,782 --> 00:51:59,428
[SPEAKER_09]: And so whatever those expenses are, as we look toward fiscal realities in the future, we're able to offer these last summer, this summer, but

542
00:51:59,955 --> 00:52:07,438
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, we may have to find creative ways to pay for staffing to do things if they continue in the future.

543
00:52:08,619 --> 00:52:11,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

544
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Member McLaughlin.

545
00:52:13,221 --> 00:52:13,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

546
00:52:14,441 --> 00:52:15,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the report.

547
00:52:15,582 --> 00:52:22,445
[SPEAKER_13]: It is really extensive and really exciting to see so much more opportunity in the summer for our kids and

548
00:52:23,734 --> 00:52:33,625
[SPEAKER_13]: It's great when they're through the school and they are affordable and free for, like you said, for many of them in the community schools actually even some of the cost of the community schools are pretty reasonable.

549
00:52:33,665 --> 00:52:42,195
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that summer fun camp which we've been part of for many years was really reasonable and really enjoyable so I really appreciate you putting this together.

550
00:52:42,255 --> 00:52:43,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I did want to just put out there.

551
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,320
[SPEAKER_13]: food for thought.

552
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:52,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and not that I necessarily expect a response now, but I would just like, you know, folks to think about it, have some open conversation.

553
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:54,324
[SPEAKER_13]: And I mentioned this to, um, Ms.

554
00:52:54,364 --> 00:53:08,130
[SPEAKER_13]: Bowen as well, um, because it's been brought up several times by a number of families about having accessible summer programming for, um, students with disabilities, English learners, obviously beyond ESY, beyond the academic, beyond the EL programming.

555
00:53:08,731 --> 00:53:13,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so for the camps, the, you know, um, sports activities, those sorts of things,

556
00:53:14,744 --> 00:53:19,527
[SPEAKER_13]: which I know that our response, the initial sort of response is, well, everything's inclusive.

557
00:53:19,567 --> 00:53:22,808
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course we are, but it's more than being inclusive.

558
00:53:22,868 --> 00:53:24,749
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about being adaptive and accessible.

559
00:53:24,849 --> 00:53:27,831
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that making sure that we're thinking about that for programming.

560
00:53:27,911 --> 00:53:36,475
[SPEAKER_13]: So for example, we have these really great unified sports programs now that are starting with miss Andre, who's been doing wonderfully with them.

561
00:53:36,495 --> 00:53:38,096
[SPEAKER_13]: And the kids are really enjoying them.

562
00:53:38,136 --> 00:53:42,898
[SPEAKER_13]: And so many kids that maybe are struggling otherwise are really coming out in those groups.

563
00:53:42,938 --> 00:53:44,119
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's really heartening to see

564
00:53:44,577 --> 00:53:51,042
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm wondering what and how something like that could be integrated into summer programming so that we're making sure that we're being inclusive.

565
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:51,582
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know Ms.

566
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:56,806
[SPEAKER_13]: Andre had mentioned something about, you know, even in tandem with like an ESY, right?

567
00:53:56,826 --> 00:54:11,076
[SPEAKER_13]: So they have say morning ESY for students and then an afternoon integrated program with and without students with disabilities, maybe with, you know, some opportunities for high school students to participate, what have you, but just sort of putting a bug in people's ear to be thinking about like, what does that look like?

568
00:54:11,116 --> 00:54:12,898
[SPEAKER_13]: And also we have a new outside,

569
00:54:13,937 --> 00:54:15,959
[SPEAKER_13]: program with Spotlight Productions.

570
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:18,501
[SPEAKER_13]: They're doing an adaptive theater program now, which is great.

571
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:28,729
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, 800 of our students are on IEPs, which is not an insignificant number, obviously, in a population that I think we should, you know, really think about.

572
00:54:28,789 --> 00:54:41,879
[SPEAKER_13]: And then I think a lot of people in the world as well, just because of, you know, everything that's been happening in the country the past few years and the inclusive nature of people's thoughts as they're looking at equity, diversity and inclusion around the globe, really.

573
00:54:42,797 --> 00:54:49,380
[SPEAKER_13]: people are just thinking about how do we make this into something broader and bigger and thinking about everybody.

574
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:55,342
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I guess I just would love to be part of that in whatever way we can to be thinking about what that looks like.

575
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:59,583
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, there, I think it's something like 50 million people with disabilities in the world.

576
00:54:59,643 --> 00:55:00,944
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a big market out there.

577
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:03,244
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a big untapped market out there.

578
00:55:03,264 --> 00:55:10,327
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think you'll see a lot of, you know, people in the disability community going to, you know, specific camps, what have you, there's a lot of opportunity for

579
00:55:10,885 --> 00:55:13,626
[SPEAKER_13]: them, but also for the camps and potential revenue building.

580
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:15,687
[SPEAKER_13]: So just wanted to mention that too.

581
00:55:15,827 --> 00:55:16,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for this.

582
00:55:17,048 --> 00:55:19,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

583
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:25,772
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may, I just have one question about the academic skills camp at the middle school level.

584
00:55:27,933 --> 00:55:32,836
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talk about academic skills, are you talking about things like executive function skills?

585
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:35,657
[SPEAKER_09]: So that wasn't initially considered.

586
00:55:36,638 --> 00:55:40,459
[SPEAKER_09]: However, however, I think like member Russo made a great suggestion earlier.

587
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:41,739
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a great suggestion.

588
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:54,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I will say that, um, and doing my own research personally for how best to instill executive function skills in a child, which turns out I now have to, um, the only reason why I say that is, is because I think you make a really great point.

589
00:55:54,723 --> 00:56:03,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think that, um, looking at various people I know, um, who have older children, the executive coaching,

590
00:56:04,378 --> 00:56:07,820
[SPEAKER_09]: executive function coaching has exploded.

591
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:15,423
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that those types of resources is something that we really should be taking consider at, to be taking gander at.

592
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:20,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm definitely happy to add that to the slate.

593
00:56:21,257 --> 00:56:27,801
[SPEAKER_06]: And is that program an invitational program or is that like an open to anyone in the district?

594
00:56:27,981 --> 00:56:32,884
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea for the academic skills on this is actually for it to be open to anyone.

595
00:56:34,765 --> 00:56:38,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, and this may change based on funding available from DESE,

596
00:56:39,468 --> 00:56:46,418
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea is to simply give kids fun things that have strong academic skills built into them.

597
00:56:46,959 --> 00:56:52,648
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of like a sneak attack and we give them good foundational skills and steam.

598
00:56:52,948 --> 00:56:55,472
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so science, technology, engineering arts.

599
00:56:55,965 --> 00:57:12,130
[SPEAKER_09]: math in those two weeks prior that gets them in the mood for school again, without being specifically focused on reading, specifically focused on math, but gives them some of those skills in a way that is overall focused on fun.

600
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:16,031
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not a, oh, I have to do this.

601
00:57:16,311 --> 00:57:17,651
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a, I want to do this.

602
00:57:17,852 --> 00:57:22,453
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to be engaged in the fun of learning for this period of time.

603
00:57:22,976 --> 00:57:31,985
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think executive coaching would actually be something good to consider how to organize a binder, how to organize notes, how to, you know, plan your day, various things along those.

604
00:57:32,766 --> 00:57:41,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I know we have Dr. Cushing spoken about this at the middle school level a couple of times offline and there's a lot of parents out there.

605
00:57:41,707 --> 00:57:47,169
[SPEAKER_06]: especially at the middle school level, where as a parent, you just have no visibility to what is happening in the school at all.

606
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:51,230
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no conferences, like you really have to work to know what's going on.

607
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:58,512
[SPEAKER_06]: And if your kid is struggling with like the basics of like organization, it's even harder to help them at home.

608
00:57:58,632 --> 00:58:09,955
[SPEAKER_06]: So thinking about not just during summer, but in general, how do we do a better job of helping kids get good baseline functional

609
00:58:10,536 --> 00:58:24,066
[SPEAKER_06]: executive functioning skills in middle school to sort of position them to be ready for high school, I think would be a huge asset both in summer and in some sort of afterschool something or other and in the curriculum in middle school.

610
00:58:24,086 --> 00:58:26,988
[SPEAKER_06]: But I definitely think there's an opportunity to like weave that in.

611
00:58:27,028 --> 00:58:38,876
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there's a lot of parents out there who, if that was part of the process would be quite interested in figuring out how they can get their kid to engage for that 90 minutes a day.

612
00:58:42,503 --> 00:58:43,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any other questions?

613
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,640
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I just wanted to say thank you to Ms.

614
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:49,741
[SPEAKER_10]: Galluzzi and Dr. Cushing for pulling, and also Ms.

615
00:58:49,781 --> 00:58:54,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Bowen for pulling all of this, all of the summer programming together.

616
00:58:54,442 --> 00:59:09,086
[SPEAKER_10]: As you can see, there is a lot going on and member Graham, we are making a serious effort to try to communicate early so that people can start thinking about all of the options that are gonna be available as they're beginning to plan for the summer.

617
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:12,467
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanna say thank you for all the hard work

618
00:59:13,247 --> 00:59:16,450
[SPEAKER_10]: bringing everything into one presentation.

619
00:59:16,631 --> 00:59:21,816
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you look at it collectively, you realize that we really are offering a lot for our community.

620
00:59:22,357 --> 00:59:23,378
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to the both of you.

621
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:25,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

622
00:59:27,082 --> 00:59:32,347
[SPEAKER_06]: Item number four report on the superintendent's listening tour in the Medford public schools, Dr. Edward Vincent.

623
00:59:43,255 --> 00:59:52,863
[SPEAKER_10]: For this presentation, during the month of March, I embarked on a listening tour.

624
00:59:56,346 --> 01:00:06,134
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is going to be kind of a high level overview of what transpired during this listening tour.

625
01:00:09,176 --> 01:00:11,358
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing I can say is the journey.

626
01:00:16,917 --> 01:00:19,539
[SPEAKER_10]: So the journey I took, it started in the month of March.

627
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,583
[SPEAKER_10]: I embarked on a listening tour within the district.

628
01:00:25,845 --> 01:00:40,978
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wanted to say in light of all of the adjustments and changes that we had to make as we navigated through the pandemic, it truly would not have been prudent to conduct business as usual.

629
01:00:43,002 --> 01:00:50,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet instruction was taking place every day in all of our classrooms and schools were up and running.

630
01:00:52,544 --> 01:01:05,086
[SPEAKER_10]: So in my continued pursuit of system coherence and the implementation of our strategic plan, the time was right to gather information about what was happening in Medford.

631
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:07,907
[SPEAKER_10]: So how did it come about?

632
01:01:09,569 --> 01:01:13,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Drawing upon the research work that my superintendent resident, Ms.

633
01:01:14,012 --> 01:01:21,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Carmen Williams was working on, building upon the administrative professional development that took place this year.

634
01:01:21,216 --> 01:01:32,223
[SPEAKER_10]: I implemented portions of the coaching conversation guide, which was a protocol that we used on professional development.

635
01:01:32,763 --> 01:01:38,107
[SPEAKER_10]: But in addition to that, we spent a significant amount of time this year looking at data.

636
01:01:40,028 --> 01:01:44,473
[SPEAKER_10]: Street data, map data, satellite data, all different forms of data.

637
01:01:44,573 --> 01:01:46,375
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was the book that was used.

638
01:01:47,757 --> 01:01:54,365
[SPEAKER_10]: And in this particular book, which is a great resource, Street Data by Shane Saphir and Jamila Duggan.

639
01:01:55,865 --> 01:02:03,948
[SPEAKER_10]: It also talked about the power and the importance of listening and listening being an important tool.

640
01:02:04,588 --> 01:02:14,832
[SPEAKER_10]: So as I embarked on this journey, I kept in mind, empathy, I hear you, equity, I see you, collaboration, I am with you.

641
01:02:20,094 --> 01:02:20,834
[SPEAKER_02]: So my why.

642
01:02:22,693 --> 01:02:26,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, data matters, but alternative data also matters.

643
01:02:28,157 --> 01:02:32,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Standardized assessments don't always tell the whole story.

644
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:35,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Our stories matter.

645
01:02:37,245 --> 01:02:42,669
[SPEAKER_10]: And with that, I think about self, social emotional learning in general for adults as well.

646
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:44,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And listening matters.

647
01:02:51,201 --> 01:02:55,845
[SPEAKER_10]: So the five tenets of social-emotional learning, you've seen this wheel before.

648
01:02:55,865 --> 01:03:00,929
[SPEAKER_10]: This was taken from the castle out of Chicago.

649
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:15,120
[SPEAKER_10]: The five tenets of social-emotional learning are self-management, responsible decision-making, relationship skills, social awareness, and self-awareness.

650
01:03:16,621 --> 01:03:18,882
[SPEAKER_10]: All of those five spokes

651
01:03:20,043 --> 01:03:24,066
[SPEAKER_02]: are what make up the entirety of social and emotional learning.

652
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:30,232
[SPEAKER_02]: As I went on this listening tour,

653
01:03:32,396 --> 01:03:53,958
[SPEAKER_10]: Thus far, I have spoken with about 101 educators within the district, teachers, paraprofessionals, librarians, all different special educators, English learning teachers, specialists, all across the district in all of the different schools.

654
01:03:55,179 --> 01:04:00,403
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition to meeting and listening to teachers and staff.

655
01:04:01,183 --> 01:04:12,050
[SPEAKER_10]: I also had conversations with principals and administrators, and at this point in time, I have met with 20 of them to have

656
01:04:14,432 --> 01:04:21,057
[SPEAKER_10]: conversations with them about problems of practice and saying, what's a challenge that you're facing?

657
01:04:21,177 --> 01:04:22,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's work together.

658
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:26,921
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's think together about this possible problem of practice.

659
01:04:26,941 --> 01:04:30,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's troubleshoot together and see if we can come up with solutions.

660
01:04:31,004 --> 01:04:35,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes we could, sometimes we couldn't, but again, it was an opportunity to listen.

661
01:04:39,631 --> 01:04:40,792
[SPEAKER_10]: As I went on this journey,

662
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:49,762
[SPEAKER_10]: I am including here a few quotes that kind of jumped out at me.

663
01:04:52,102 --> 01:04:54,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Teacher said, I love ECRI.

664
01:04:55,763 --> 01:04:59,484
[SPEAKER_10]: I want math professional development to be like ECRI.

665
01:05:01,165 --> 01:05:04,445
[SPEAKER_10]: One point person to come to model in my classroom.

666
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:10,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Another teacher said, we want someone to work with us.

667
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:18,283
[SPEAKER_10]: It is going to be a new program, and they were referring to math, having a point person with expertise in an area.

668
01:05:19,784 --> 01:05:24,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Another said, responsive classroom block is really working.

669
01:05:26,767 --> 01:05:31,289
[SPEAKER_10]: In another building, our school adjustment counselor is amazing.

670
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:40,653
[SPEAKER_10]: Eleni, who's a professional developer with ECRI, the teacher said, it's the best PD

671
01:05:42,168 --> 01:05:45,391
[SPEAKER_10]: ever for them and they loved the coaching with the Zooms.

672
01:05:47,873 --> 01:05:50,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Others said, bring back the joy, bring the joy back.

673
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:53,157
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a great day to be a Mustang.

674
01:05:54,238 --> 01:06:05,828
[SPEAKER_10]: And they wanted t-shirts to be made for all the students to say, it's a great day to be a Mustang for next school year because they feel like the pandemic has exhausted all of us.

675
01:06:08,993 --> 01:06:12,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Other teachers asked for more teacher led professional development.

676
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:24,369
[SPEAKER_10]: There's really this thirst for teachers designing to work collaboratively together to learn from one another, even a suggestion of being able to go and visit.

677
01:06:24,949 --> 01:06:30,134
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I was at the middle school, one of the teachers suggested, can we go up to ninth grade.

678
01:06:30,955 --> 01:06:38,298
[SPEAKER_10]: do professional development, see what's happening in ninth grade and come back and say, oh, this is how we can make adjustments to practice.

679
01:06:38,938 --> 01:06:48,662
[SPEAKER_10]: So teachers gave wonderful examples, their best thinking and just different ways of looking at how we can improve the district and make a difference for our students.

680
01:06:50,404 --> 01:06:55,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Another teacher said, we need more support, training and grace.

681
01:06:56,088 --> 01:07:08,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Asking us to really keep that in mind because we've been working in a pandemic and there are a lot of unknowns that we had to experience and go through.

682
01:07:09,816 --> 01:07:13,798
[SPEAKER_10]: But that was something that had just jumped out at me when it was said.

683
01:07:15,659 --> 01:07:19,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Another session, they said, bring back book groups.

684
01:07:20,685 --> 01:07:23,166
[SPEAKER_10]: bring back professional learning communities.

685
01:07:23,947 --> 01:07:40,735
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it was something where if I think about key themes, professional development ended up really surfacing as an area, Dr. Cushing, could you please advance?

686
01:07:40,775 --> 01:07:41,155
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

687
01:07:41,555 --> 01:07:45,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Professional development really surfaced as an area that

688
01:07:47,738 --> 01:07:59,429
[SPEAKER_10]: Teachers want to continue learning, learning in different ways, learning from strong educators and quality professional development and having opportunities to learn from one another.

689
01:07:59,449 --> 01:08:03,473
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was definitely a theme that that surfaced.

690
01:08:05,354 --> 01:08:12,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Teachers talked about self social emotional learning and working with students and trying to meet the needs of students.

691
01:08:13,341 --> 01:08:28,794
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I had mentioned again responsive classroom and those kinds of things that we were being very intentional about to meet the needs of our students, bringing back the joy, because there were so many rules and regulations during the pandemic.

692
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:34,180
[SPEAKER_10]: masks shields sanitizer, you know distance.

693
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:38,684
[SPEAKER_10]: And so finally kind of getting back to some sense of normalcy.

694
01:08:38,704 --> 01:08:47,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that kind of came through like they're, they're ready to bring back the joy for the students and get back to some sense of normalcy.

695
01:08:48,573 --> 01:09:11,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Teachers did ask for more support as we think about the structure of the district, thinking about our growing EL population, students with disabilities, counselors, to make sure that we keep those resources in place.

696
01:09:12,391 --> 01:09:25,380
[SPEAKER_10]: And additional staffing, like this year with the pandemic, sometimes we had some positions that still were not filled despite having them posted for months.

697
01:09:26,041 --> 01:09:35,207
[SPEAKER_10]: And so thinking about, oh, I wish if there's a possibility to have more staffing, if we could have an additional paraprofessional or something like that.

698
01:09:35,807 --> 01:09:38,910
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was just something that also kind of surfaced.

699
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:46,656
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I just wanted to point that out as some of the key themes.

700
01:09:46,996 --> 01:09:55,923
[SPEAKER_10]: I really wanna just also say thank you right now, a special thank you to all the staff that were part of the listening tour.

701
01:09:55,943 --> 01:10:05,171
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanna say that your willingness to share, be transparent, be vulnerable, and provide feedback to me was greatly, greatly, greatly appreciated.

702
01:10:05,751 --> 01:10:07,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Your voice matters and it counted.

703
01:10:10,543 --> 01:10:17,528
[SPEAKER_10]: And in closing, I just wanted to say there was one final slide, Dr. Cushing, homage to you, Dr. Cushing.

704
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:30,838
[SPEAKER_10]: I ended with saying that to the teachers that were in staff and administrators that were part of the listening tour, that I am your proud superintendent.

705
01:10:31,478 --> 01:10:34,380
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, indeed, it is a great day to be a Mustang.

706
01:10:35,021 --> 01:10:35,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

707
01:10:37,102 --> 01:10:38,303
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

708
01:10:40,047 --> 01:10:41,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any questions?

709
01:10:44,530 --> 01:10:45,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Hayes?

710
01:10:48,232 --> 01:10:49,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to thank you for this.

711
01:10:49,393 --> 01:11:01,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's helpful, especially the timing of this rate, given that we're coming up on budget season, and it's good to get this feedback of what teachers are letting you know they feel like they need, because that's important.

712
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,321
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, it's critical for us to know that as we look at the budget.

713
01:11:06,004 --> 01:11:20,146
[SPEAKER_04]: That one quote that really stood out to you and stands out to me too, and I'm curious if you have any more details about what this teacher or support staff, I don't know who it was coming from, you said, we need more support, training, and grace.

714
01:11:21,478 --> 01:11:30,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Did they talk about areas where they felt they needed more support and training in specific, or was it more just a general?

715
01:11:31,026 --> 01:11:39,033
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really, in that particular quote, it was a group of students, not a group of students, it was a clustered group of teachers.

716
01:11:39,573 --> 01:11:46,138
[SPEAKER_10]: Because during the listening tour, I met with some people one on one, and we tried to have no groups, no larger than four.

717
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:54,781
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it was, you know, they were talking about support, time to learn the new curriculum.

718
01:11:54,801 --> 01:12:03,644
[SPEAKER_10]: I think, Grace, in the sense of like we're bringing on new programming, we just went through all of this adjustment.

719
01:12:05,024 --> 01:12:09,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Please keep in mind that as we're getting the training, we need support, you know,

720
01:12:11,721 --> 01:12:21,852
[SPEAKER_10]: and just keeping grace in mind so that it's not like you're pounding them over the head and saying, here's 500 more things to learn all at once.

721
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:26,357
[SPEAKER_10]: But to really think about saying, OK, this is the next initiative that we're going to do.

722
01:12:28,579 --> 01:12:33,044
[SPEAKER_10]: So many of them were involved, especially in the math pilot.

723
01:12:33,965 --> 01:12:56,190
[SPEAKER_10]: you know depending on which program they were piloting so that also the feedback of like oh I did this one and this is the one we're going to go with we know we're going to go through training and that it was it was it's one thing to know that equity professional development is quality PD but to have so many of them in different buildings

724
01:12:57,490 --> 01:13:01,992
[SPEAKER_10]: echo the feedback that it was some of the best professional development that they've ever had.

725
01:13:02,573 --> 01:13:08,395
[SPEAKER_10]: And for us as a district to try to mimic that type of professional development moving forward.

726
01:13:09,035 --> 01:13:17,419
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I think of that statement, I put it all together in the context of the greater conversation that was happening at that moment.

727
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:25,283
[SPEAKER_10]: But that was just a statement that I appreciated the vulnerability

728
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:39,208
[SPEAKER_10]: of the teacher to kind of say it, but say like, you know, give us the support and the time to learn these new programs and adjust, you know, to the changes, but, you know, continuing to do the work that needs to happen.

729
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:52,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you, if I can ask one more question, in terms of the ECRI professional development, what was it specifically about the format or the way that that professional development was done that

730
01:13:53,519 --> 01:14:17,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there was an earlier meeting, a little while back, where I think it was actually Dr. Cushing who commented that the people who came in to do that professional development at one point said, I think the way it was put, please correct me if I'm wrong, but that they were reluctant to come back again unless they could do the professional development the way they wanted to do it.

731
01:14:17,478 --> 01:14:22,201
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some statement about that and I'm curious what it was, what was.

732
01:14:22,921 --> 01:14:28,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, again, if you could give some details about what was so popular.

733
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:29,306
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, I'd be happy to.

734
01:14:29,546 --> 01:14:29,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

735
01:14:30,606 --> 01:14:32,007
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I have to turn.

736
01:14:33,528 --> 01:14:34,489
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's twofold.

737
01:14:34,989 --> 01:14:41,914
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think one is that the teachers are actually seeing the effects of the sustained training.

738
01:14:42,774 --> 01:14:46,697
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the format of it was sustained mentoring throughout the entire year.

739
01:14:47,038 --> 01:14:58,507
[SPEAKER_11]: So every month, one of the consultants from Hill for Literacy came and worked with every kindergarten, first grade and second grade staff member.

740
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:10,376
[SPEAKER_11]: So one month they may come in and they may watch the teacher teach the ECRI routines, give them on the spot feedback so that they can grow their instruction.

741
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:20,039
[SPEAKER_11]: And then other months were virtual trainings where they spent 90 minutes a month with that consultant per grade level.

742
01:15:20,059 --> 01:15:24,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So the kindergarten team met for 90 minutes, the first grade team for 90 minutes, the second grade team for 90 minutes.

743
01:15:25,163 --> 01:15:35,870
[SPEAKER_11]: And not only were they given specific professional development on the content of ECRI, but they were also able to get on the spot coaching in terms of I've tried this, it's not working.

744
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:39,985
[SPEAKER_11]: How can I walk back the skill when I've done this and the students aren't getting it.

745
01:15:40,345 --> 01:15:46,487
[SPEAKER_11]: So they have really been able to get that sustained like coaching model throughout the entire year.

746
01:15:48,427 --> 01:15:49,868
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm happy to say they'll be back next year.

747
01:15:50,488 --> 01:16:08,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and I think that part of that is that even in the, with everything that was put on teachers plates this year and how difficult this year has been and how trying to do like this new PD in, in this year alone, it's difficult in any year, but this year alone, it was really challenging for teachers.

748
01:16:08,519 --> 01:16:13,462
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think at the beginning, there was a lot of apprehension, but they have really seen firsthand.

749
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:20,410
[SPEAKER_11]: the positive effects that students are having and that they're seeing in their reading development.

750
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:22,791
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's been very meaningful for them.

751
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:24,311
[SPEAKER_11]: That help?

752
01:16:28,532 --> 01:16:29,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any other questions?

753
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:31,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Oso?

754
01:16:32,373 --> 01:16:32,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

755
01:16:33,353 --> 01:16:40,835
[SPEAKER_12]: I have heard as well that some teachers definitely like ECRI, and I know that's not the purpose of this presentation,

756
01:16:41,522 --> 01:16:51,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I would just ask that we also consider student engagement, because I have heard, the number one thing I've heard is from parents whose students would rather do almost anything else.

757
01:16:53,612 --> 01:17:00,318
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and I'm guessing there's students, for instance, that don't particularly need any assistance with reading, et cetera.

758
01:17:01,379 --> 01:17:05,562
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's all I just wanted to add, because I know that that's not the purpose of the presentation.

759
01:17:05,582 --> 01:17:06,163
[SPEAKER_12]: I am very,

760
01:17:08,496 --> 01:17:13,357
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sort of giggling a little because I know how much the superintendent absolutely loved doing this work.

761
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:21,860
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not able to see her face very clearly, but I know her well enough to know that this is probably her favorite thing she's done in the last two years.

762
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:29,502
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm looking forward to her being able to go out and really get into the classrooms and learning tours or learning walks.

763
01:17:30,142 --> 01:17:32,903
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I didn't get a chance to participate in one with her.

764
01:17:33,521 --> 01:17:36,602
[SPEAKER_12]: prior to the pandemic and then the pandemic shut those down.

765
01:17:36,642 --> 01:17:37,842
[SPEAKER_12]: So I look forward to that.

766
01:17:38,002 --> 01:17:38,322
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

767
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:41,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

768
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:43,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any other questions?

769
01:17:45,864 --> 01:17:47,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

770
01:17:47,624 --> 01:17:51,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Item number seven, presentations of the public, not to begin before 7 p.m.

771
01:17:51,705 --> 01:17:59,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Regular meetings of the school committee will include presentations of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

772
01:17:59,487 --> 01:18:01,728
[SPEAKER_06]: A resident may only speak once at any meeting.

773
01:18:02,104 --> 01:18:08,025
[SPEAKER_06]: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

774
01:18:08,666 --> 01:18:15,787
[SPEAKER_06]: If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that the item be added to a subsequent regular meeting.

775
01:18:16,247 --> 01:18:21,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Details for submitting a presentation can be found in policy BEDH, public comment and presentations of the public.

776
01:18:22,389 --> 01:18:23,689
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have any this evening.

777
01:18:25,149 --> 01:18:31,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Pursuant to policy BEDH, public comment and presentations of the public, any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak

778
01:18:32,052 --> 01:18:34,513
[SPEAKER_06]: once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

779
01:18:34,994 --> 01:18:38,035
[SPEAKER_06]: The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

780
01:18:38,656 --> 01:18:43,118
[SPEAKER_06]: The speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and full Medford Street address where they reside.

781
01:18:43,838 --> 01:18:47,680
[SPEAKER_06]: A welcoming and inclusive community is both the value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

782
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:51,422
[SPEAKER_06]: We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

783
01:18:52,563 --> 01:18:55,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Item number eight, continued business.

784
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:56,745

[SPEAKER_06]: Item number 11, condolences.

[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of former school committee member, Carol Sharpton, who was the first African-American woman guidance counselor for the Medford Public Schools.

[SPEAKER_06]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of John C. McKaylee, brother of Stephanie McKaylee,

795
01:19:55,446 --> 01:19:56,967
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can all rise for a moment of silence.

796
01:20:09,918 --> 01:20:10,278
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

797
01:20:10,298 --> 01:20:14,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to adjourn.

798
01:20:16,703 --> 01:20:17,103
[SPEAKER_06]: One second.

799
01:20:17,323 --> 01:20:22,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to let everyone know our next meeting is scheduled for next Monday on April 11th at 6 p.m.

800
