    <p>[SPEAKER_10]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1940.189s">You</a>  can stand straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1941.169s">Yeah,</a>  you can stand straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1942.43s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1943.07s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1944.151s">So</a>  how much did everybody miss? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1946.712s">Should</a>  I start over? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1947.832s">It's</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1948.352s">We</a>  got you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1949.073s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1949.973s">So</a>  we're just here because the Medford Educational Foundation is a private fund to supplement the city's public education budget by rewarding teacher innovation in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1962.518s">It's</a>  a 501c3. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1964.699s">It's</a>  an independent fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1967.027s">It</a>  did exist in Medford about 17 years ago, but my co-founder, Paulette Vanderkloot, and I resuscitated it, and we launched it in about December of 2015, and we got 501c3 status pretty quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1983.455s">And</a>  then we did a lot of fundraising. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1985.495s">We</a>  had a wonderful event at Wright's Pond in September of that same year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=1991.385s">We</a>  basically were able to give out grants to faculty as early as December 15, 2015, with a window of about a month, January 15, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2003.608s">And</a>  we awarded close to $7,000 worth of grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2009.129s">I</a>  have a reprint of a transcript article that outlines in detail what those grants were. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2015.511s">And</a>  I'm hoping if this might be something that I might submit, perhaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2022.295s">It's</a>  just a direct quote from the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2026.379s">But</a>  as I mentioned before, David Sears, also Medford resident and parent, is the head of our Grants to Faculty Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2036.448s">And</a>  he has a little presentation that I think he's going to give. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2040.352s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Kh7pOoZw_4E_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2042.634s">Thank</a>  you, Anne. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2043.134s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2044.408s">As</a>  Anne said, my name is David Sayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2046.169s">I've</a>  been a resident of Medford with my family for the past 14 years, and I am the chairperson of the Grants to Faculty Committee of the Medford Educational Fund, or MEF. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2055.933s">Tonight,</a>  I'd just like to give you a brief introduction of our goals and a short summary of the grants that we've awarded to date and plans for the near future. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2065.858s">As</a>  Anne mentioned, we launched officially in January 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2071.904s">And</a>  thanks to the support and guidance of the City of Medford officials and the generous support of local individuals and businesses, we were able to hold our first grants less than five months after becoming a 501c3 organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2085.608s">This</a>  past December, the MEF kicked off its first round of grant solicitations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2089.909s">We</a>  received 17 applications and we're pleased to be able to fund 11 of them, totaling almost $7,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2095.851s">I'd</a>  like to highlight a few of those awards for you this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2101.015s">At</a>  the elementary school level, we were able to bring the hands-on history program to three of our elementary schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2107.136s">Originally</a>  proposed by fifth grade McGlynn teacher Anthony Petrellis, Colette Van der Kloot, on behalf of the MEF, worked to expand this exciting opportunity to the Roberts and Columbus schools as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2118.758s">This</a>  program brought presenters into the schools with over $100,000 worth of original 18th century artifacts and reenactments <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2127.067s">of</a>  the soldiers during the Revolutionary War to help bring what the students are learning in the classroom to real life. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2133.769s">The</a>  MEF was also able to fund in part a grant to spearhead an innovation to bring hydroponics to the elementary school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2142.151s">Started</a>  by McGlynn principal Diane Guarino and fourth grade teacher Donna Lasky, fourth grade students are learning about hydroponics. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2149.754s">And</a>  while the students are having fun, they are also realizing how what they learn in science, math, and social studies <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2155.214s">applies</a>  to real-world problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2157.536s">At</a>  the middle school level, we were happy to fund a garden project by social studies teacher Kathleen O'Donoghue, who is teaching her 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students about how to build a sustainable food source in an urban setting and also learn about providing healthy food for themselves and their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2175.528s">At</a>  the high school level, we are helping to expand the existing successful aquaponics fish tank to include a hydroponics system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2182.717s">so</a>  that the plants will clean the water and the fish will fertilize the plants. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2186.398s">In</a>  addition, we are funding programs that target at-risk students through the Empower Student Club at the high school and teach real-world skills through Nicholas Kane's excellent docent teaching training program and teaching publishing skills through turning the online student mantra magazine into a print version. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2204.786s">In</a>  total, we were able to fund three grants at the elementary school level, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2208.708s">one</a>  at the middle school level, and seven at the high school and vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2212.691s">We</a>  have recently announced our next round of funding for the fall 2016 school year, and have already started receiving proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2220.798s">Going</a>  forward, we plan to have two main funding cycles a year, due October 15 and May 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2226.823s">Thank</a>  you for your time and attention.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2228.484s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2236.025s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2236.205s">Vanden</a>  Heuvel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2238.187s">I</a>  just want to thank Anne and David for being here today, because I am part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2243.43s">I</a>  know how hard they've worked to make this successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2246.973s">I</a>  think many of us have heard about some of the projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2249.554s">Actually,</a>  I read about some of them in the newspaper and whatever, and I knew that they were also projects that the Medford Educational Fund had funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2259.741s">So</a>  thank you to them for being here, and we appreciate the support of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2266.14s">I</a>  should also, I'd like to quickly add that it's been incredibly helpful to, Pat Vili has guided us on some of the financial things that we needed help with, and we really, really appreciate Pat's help and direction.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2289.913s">I</a>  also want to say thank you to Ian and David and everyone else who was involved in this, and to my colleague Paula Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2296.937s">What</a>  I'm really happy about is that it was not only a plan of an organization to come to us and say what your plan was going to be, but you actually put your money where your mouth was and came up with money and was able to distribute it with the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2311.986s">So</a>  I thank you for that, and I thank you for making that reality, not just talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2317.237s">It</a>  really shows when people do roll up their sleeves and work together, what things could really, can and will be accomplished. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2324.483s">So</a>  I thank you for that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2325.443s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2328.065s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2328.265s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2329.486s">I</a>  also just want to thank David and Ian, and I wanted to share an experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2333.609s">I</a>  went to Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2334.31s">Lasky's</a>  class and I got to see the, by hydroponics, yep, the hydroponics, and I got to taste the lettuce. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2342.476s">They</a>  cut it and the students brought in the dressing and <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2345.308s">It</a>  was a great experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2346.629s">And</a>  I've also seen the aquaponics at the high school, Mr. Russo's class. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2350.073s">And</a>  it's just a wonderful experience for the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2353.556s">And</a>  it was just so fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2354.917s">And</a>  the kids were so happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2355.978s">And</a>  thank you so much.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2358.501s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2359.161s">Thank</a>  you very much for all your hard work on behalf of the students of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2362.605s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2370.243s">Motion</a>  to receive in place on file the report by Miss Van der Klooth, seconded by Mr. Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2375.009s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2376.29s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2377.091s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2378.473s">Also</a>  while we're into suspension from community participation, Anne-Sherla Monzel-Moore, follow-up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2383.959s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2384.139s">Moore.</a> </p>

    <p>[Angela Moore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2387.29s">Good</a>  evening and thank you school committee, um, Mr. Superintendent and Madam Mayor for allowing me to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2393.595s">Um,</a>  I spoke before you on April 11th and I asked the committee to have a transparent succession plan for the position of superintendent in place by June of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2404.143s">On</a>  May 3rd, I attended the city council meeting and was very surprised to learn that in the superintendent's contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2411.987s">It</a>  states that the school committee shall advise the superintendent of its intent to extend his contract by June 30, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2419.95s">I</a>  was disappointed to hear this from a city Councilor given the fact four committee members were part of the negotiations for the current contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2426.893s">That</a>  information could have been relayed to me when I spoke on April 11th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2431.695s">With</a>  that being said, I would assume the committee will have a plan in place by the given date. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2435.777s">This</a>  is probably the most important role that you as a school committee member <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2439.43s">will</a>  play in your tenure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2440.591s">It's</a>  your legacy as elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2442.893s">You</a>  can get this right or you can get this very wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2446.015s">I</a>  followed up with each of you individually via email, and again, did not receive a response from the majority of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2451.679s">From</a>  those that did respond, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2454.481s">What</a>  I'm asking from you is to devise a plan in the event Medford needs to hire a new superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2459.545s">You've</a>  not been faced with such a task in over 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2463.748s">And</a>  if the need did arise any time soon, you would have no guidelines set forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2468.569s">Such</a>  a situation would surely result in panic and a haphazard process of finding a replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2474.515s">Ultimately,</a>  this is not about Mr. Belson's contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2477.518s">However,</a>  the fact that it is the catalyst for such a discussion cannot be ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2481.923s">I'm</a>  speaking to you as a citizen you have been elected to represent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2485.987s">I'm</a>  also speaking to you on behalf of the 250 other residents <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2490.109s">that</a>  have signed both an online and paper petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2492.971s">I'm</a>  frustrated a petition had to be started asking you to do your due diligence and ensure that proper measures are being taken regarding filling one of the most important positions in our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2502.916s">This</a>  is not just a small group of people with a sudden sense of urgency that are concerned about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2508.219s">These</a>  are your constituents, and this is a plan that should always have been in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2512.962s">With</a>  all of that being said, I will reiterate the questions I have regarding the process for renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2518.907s">and</a>  the subsequent questions should a contract not be renewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2522.19s">Please</a>  feel free to take notes and answer when I'm done speaking. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2525.393s">As</a>  I said before, this plan is not just about this contract, but since this contract is the one being renewed, it needs to be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2533.12s">I</a>  understand Mr. Belson is currently working on a self-evaluation as stated in his contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2538.004s">I</a>  further understand you will then begin your process of evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2541.696s">Given</a>  you are obligated to work on this as a committee, at what point do you discuss your evaluations if the superintendent is always present at every meeting and every executive session? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2551.122s">Is</a>  this process made public and is there an opportunity for public input? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2555.665s">Is</a>  Mr. Belson's contract automatically extended on June 30th if your evaluations determine he is performing in a satisfactory manner? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2564.291s">At</a>  this point, I feel your lack of a succession plan will truly come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2568.353s">If</a>  Mr. Belson announces at a later date that he plans on retiring, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2571.689s">What</a>  is your plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2573.55s">A</a>  plan should answer the following questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2575.93s">What</a>  are the guidelines put forth with respect to renewing the superintendent's contract and finding a replacement? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2582.292s">These</a>  guidelines should include, but not be limited to, evaluation of the current superintendent as set forth by the terms in his contract, allowing the school committee to do their own evaluation and discuss said evaluations without the superintendent present, gathering input from the community regarding their evaluations, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2600.478s">If</a>  the contract is renewed, it should be clearly documented how recent and longstanding issues within the school system will be addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2607.923s">Clearly</a>  stated and documented requirements for a successor should be put forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2614.268s">The</a>  guidelines should coherently document what the initiatives and direction of Medford Public Schools are and how they will be sustained by a successor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2622.854s">You</a>  need to evaluate the potential for an internal replacement and the eligibility requirements for such a vertical career move. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2630.675s">You</a>  need to establish a timeline for searching for and transitioning in a replacement, allowing time for a replacement to work alongside the current superintendent if possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2641.219s">And</a>  lastly, you need to determine how to record and maintain the knowledge that Mr. Belson does currently possess. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2646.961s">It's</a>  a vast amount of knowledge and it's a vast network that he has created. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2652.202s">And</a>  you need to know how to relay that to a successor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2655.147s">What</a>  I'm proposing should be a matter of routine governing within the realm of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2660.132s">As</a>  stated by one resident who signed the petition, succession planning is critical for a smooth search and leadership transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2668.281s">We</a>  need the school committee to be proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2670.823s">As</a>  our elected representatives, they should implement a thoughtful, transparent process that prioritizes community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2678.562s">I</a>  urge you to complete this process sooner rather than later and avoid the possibility of panic in our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2684.784s">There</a>  is indeed a sense of urgency since a proper search and transition should a replacement be needed will likely take a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2691.225s">Now</a>  is the time you should be organizing yourselves and preparing yourself to take action if necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2696.327s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2698.468s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2698.648s">Cugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2700.028s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2701.029s">And</a>  thank you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2701.669s">Moore</a>  for coming here again and bringing your concerns to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2706.67s">And</a>  I respect that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2709.271s">I'm</a>  going to address something in the room that maybe no one wants to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2713.632s">And</a>  that is the elephant in the room, the rumors, the Facebook posts, the discussions between constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2720.111s">and</a>  not to mention the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2722.613s">As</a>  a member of the School Committee, I truly want to thank you and I want to thank anyone who is truly concerned and has a vested interest in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2731.399s">I</a>  love the idea of having people come up and discuss their ideas, for this is the forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2736.504s">where</a>  this discussion should be held. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2738.846s">However,</a>  I also want to remind everyone as a school committee member, there is a process and a succession of what we as a body need and decide to discuss and determine for the best interest of our district. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2751.296s">As</a>  a committee member or anyone who needs to compare and evaluate, we need to compare one year to the next. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2757.361s">And</a>  we are in the process of collecting that data. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2760.343s">Now,</a>  as far as transparency, let's address what maybe I took for granted <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2766.672s">That</a>  was obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2768.473s">I</a>  will speak for myself as a school committee member. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2771.235s">After</a>  investing 10 years, completed years, nine years as MASC, as a member, executive board member, and not to mention the president of Massachusetts Association of School Committees, meaning that I represent of all the school committee members in the state, the projects, the money, the time, the networking in our city, across the state and country, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2792.462s">We</a>  have invested, and I hope and think parents, students, administrators, teachers, and constituents in our district would not believe that we, as your elected officials, would have been given this position and will take the hiring of a new superintendent very lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2809.012s">The</a>  hiring of superintendent, especially under our circumstances, whatever you agree or disagree, like or dislike the superintendent, the gentleman has been in a position for many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2821.74s">For</a>  some of you, that may be a con. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2824.142s">For</a>  some, it may be a pro. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2826.804s">Personal</a>  preference, but for a person who has been around, and I can honestly say and tell you I've been on many sides and have seen our administration work, where many of you have not, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2838.618s">I</a>  can tell you we have and are represented very well across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2842.844s">I</a>  know this is not the point for many of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2845.047s">You</a>  are asking for transparency in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2847.971s">Educated</a>  in what the superintendent search entails and knowing what other cities are going through right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2855.253s">This</a>  is something that we as a school committee need to sit down and discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2859.857s">We</a>  have had certain maybe not official meetings, but the discussion has come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2866.043s">But</a>  we need to have certain things done in succession. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2869.206s">As</a>  I mentioned before, the superintendent has already spoken to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2873.249s">We</a>  already knew when the evaluation is going to be presented to us as far as what the next step was going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2883.475s">And</a>  so I guess at this point, I just really want to say that we are very much aware of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2889.984s">And</a>  it's kind of frustrating as a school committee member to sit there and know the hard work that people in our city have done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2898.588s">The</a>  children that were here tonight, that shows what we have in our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2903.209s">Not</a>  only in the group that was here this evening, but in many groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2906.27s">This</a>  last month and a half, we have done nothing but give certificates out, not from us, but what our children have achieved in the state of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2915.152s">So</a>  to sit and listen over and over again, to listen to people just throw things out that are not factual is very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2923.215s">So</a>  with all due respect, I do and ask that I make a motion this evening <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2928.596s">that</a>  we have the meeting of the superintendent committee of the whole for the superintendent's evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2936.481s">And</a>  then we also need to have the meeting of executive, the executive meeting, I'm sorry, the executive committee of, executive meeting for his contract.</p>

    <p>[Angela Moore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2979.405s">I</a>  would just like to follow up to that to say that I am actually a very proud product of Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2987.209s">My</a>  children attend Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2989.47s">I</a>  am extraordinarily aware <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2992.116s">of</a>  what Medford Public Schools have done, what they can do, and I hope to God what they will do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=2997.823s">So</a>  for you to sit there and say that I don't appreciate what goes on in the Medford Public Schools is an outright travesty. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3004.592s">With</a>  that being said, I am not asking you <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3009.072s">to</a>  simply sit there and say if you're going to renew or not renew Mr. Belson's contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3013.336s">What</a>  I'm asking you is to have a transparent process if it has to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3018.64s">If,</a>  God forbid, he couldn't perform his job tomorrow, what is the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3023.284s">And</a>  you'll say it's transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3024.745s">Well,</a>  then why did I stand here in front of you in April and not one of you had the audacity, not one of you could say anything to me? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3032.391s">You</a>  didn't acknowledge that I was here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3034.933s">So</a>  don't tell me that's transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3038.054s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3043.578s">Angela,</a>  I didn't say it was you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3045.159s">I'm</a>  saying in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3046.0s">Well,</a>  I'm the one standing up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3047.32s">Actually,</a>  I said thank you to you when you first came, and I said it a couple of times, actually, that I enjoy that when you do come, this is where the forum should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3056.647s">It's</a>  very, very frustrating to be on this side, too, just as much as it is for you that you want to do the best you possibly can for your children. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3063.872s">But</a>  it's very frustrating on this side working the hours that everybody works, not just me, I'm no one compared to everybody in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3071.286s">But</a>  to sit here week after week and listen to everyone else discuss our <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3077.8s">Our</a>  due diligence of what we're doing for our children is very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3081.925s">I've</a>  said it to you before and I will say it to you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3084.348s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this up to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3086.23s">But</a>  you also have to understand that there is a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3090.535s">I'm</a>  not saying that the process is behind closed doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3093.999s">We</a>  haven't been in that situation in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3096.982s">And</a>  you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3098.283s">We've</a>  always talked about, if God forbid anything happens, that we want to know what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3104.409s">But</a>  to sit here and know outside of this room that already there is people talking about, oh, we're hiring or we're firing, that's not fair to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3113.877s">And</a>  I'm not saying that that was you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3116.058s">And</a>  I know that you have children in the system, because my children have been with your children. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3120.342s">So</a>  I am not getting more aggravated at you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3123.945s">I</a>  thanked you for coming to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3125.966s">But</a>  you need to give us, you, the public, needs to give us some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3130.829s">Because</a>  there hasn't been time to sit down and do what we have to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3134.392s">And</a>  it's kind of ironic, we can't evaluate something if you have nothing to evaluate it from. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3139.596s">We</a>  have to evaluate the evening with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3142.978s">Well,</a>  we have to wait for the evening of the superintendent, and that is coming up this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3147.901s">So,</a>  I mean, I understand the frustration of everybody, but you also have to understand the frustration of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3153.263s">Me,</a>  myself, as a parent, totally understand, but I'm on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3157.785s">And</a>  it's very frustrating when you know your children are doing 100 percent the best they possibly can, and they're striving, and people just come to you and just <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3167.472s">keep</a>  on saying facts that are not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3170.253s">If</a>  we're going to throw facts out there, let's remember, I don't know, a little bit of reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3175.676s">And</a>  we sit here, I'm number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3177.977s">I</a>  started here 10 years ago with let's not bully anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3182.219s">What</a>  kind of a message are we sending as adults to our children that we say don't bully? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3188.501s">And</a>  we're at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3190.562s">It's</a>  very frustrating.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3195.163s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3195.764s">Um,</a>  I don't agree with my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3198.005s">First</a>  of all, when you came in April, I wish I had said something, but you did make me think. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3203.768s">And</a>  I did request the superintendent's contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3206.19s">And</a>  that's when I found out that as a school committee member, the June 30th date, I did not know that prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3213.234s">And,</a>  um, I'm honest and truthful, but prior to that, there were discussions and there were requests and evaluation processes happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3222.58s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3223.371s">That</a>  actual date of June 30th, knowing that, that's where that came about. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3228.095s">And</a>  I brought it to a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3229.985s">after</a>  you came forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3231.606s">And</a>  I apologize because I know it's not easy to stand there in front of a body of people and a whole nother room full of people and just ask about a process and not making it personal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3243.593s">I</a>  do this all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3245.514s">I</a>  do it with asking for budgets and I do it for oh, so many things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3250.117s">And</a>  people think I'm like, what do you want to know? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3253.019s">I</a>  just want to know what's happening so I can make good judgments. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3256.621s">And</a>  I think that's what's happening here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3258.742s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3260.097s">The</a>  stuff going on, the parents making comments and bring them up, most of them <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3269.558s">Not</a>  all of them, but most of them, about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3273.439s">What</a>  do we do? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3274.719s">We've</a>  had a great run with Superintendent Bellson. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3279.24s">We</a>  wouldn't have our science labs without him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3282.481s">I</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3283.681s">I</a>  know that better than anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3285.261s">He</a>  came to this meeting and presented it, and it's amazing that we have that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3289.762s">That</a>  got one third of our high school building remodeled at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3293.383s">I</a>  mean, I watched in awe as that happened in front of me and made sure that it expanded our whole vocational education. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3300.369s">And</a>  he's done so many wonderful things, but that does not mean he's going to be here forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3305.714s">And</a>  we do need to start the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3308.176s">I</a>  have asked for his self-evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3310.938s">As</a>  far as I've been told from him, he is going to provide that to us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3315.562s">May</a>  16th is the date he told us at a prior meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3319.265s">I</a>  was looking forward to seeing that this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3321.752s">If</a>  that date has changed, he can correct me and tell me why that's changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3325.775s">But</a>  we need sufficient time to go over his self-evaluation and do our evaluation that we do every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3332.659s">We</a>  do this every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3334.08s">And</a>  every year, I talk about his strengths. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3336.381s">And</a>  every year, I talk about areas of growth, just like anyone in any job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3341.804s">And</a>  whether or not he has the option of deciding whether he's coming back, but he doesn't have to tell us until September 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3349.209s">That's</a>  what the contract says. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3351.15s">My</a>  obligation as a school committee member and to the people who voted me into this seat is to make sure you feel that it's transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3359.336s">If</a>  you ever have a question, I will answer it honestly as to the process and what happened in my eyes and in my viewpoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3366.741s">So</a>  I commend you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3369.703s">I</a>  know that we're going to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3371.304s">I'm</a>  very happy to have the meeting on the second. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3374.366s">I</a>  would like the superintendent's evaluation prior to that so we can provide our <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3380.272s">evaluations</a>  of him on that evening so that way we commit and meet our deadlines. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3386.141s">And</a>  I would like it published in a way that all of our community understands that we're doing this like we did last year, like we did the year prior. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3396.676s">I</a>  don't want to be disrespectful to a person, but I want the process to be more clear, more understandable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3405.778s">Maybe</a>  this year we want to—we've always had the opportunity for people to come and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3410.799s">We</a>  usually don't have that in our audience, and I'm glad to see that some people are here and lined up to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3418.221s">But</a>  that's a time for when we do his evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3422.625s">That</a>  might not be tonight, but if you feel like you're here and you're ready to speak, I am more than happy to hear every single person in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3431.406s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3432.126s">So</a>  that's my take in all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3434.547s">I</a>  commend you for coming forward April 3rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3436.828s">Cause</a>  you, you started some me thinking and my actions moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3442.291s">So</a>  I don't know if the superintendent is still planning on providing us that information this evening, and maybe we can figure out a timeline right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3450.935s">And</a>  I applaud my colleague as far as setting up dates and moving forward and calling for a committee of the whole.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3458.178s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3458.378s">Krutz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3459.173s">Oh,</a>  hi, Angela. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3459.953s">Thank</a>  you for coming out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3461.174s">And,</a>  um, I, I did respond to your email and I let you know that, you know, I'm new. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3466.836s">There's</a>  a couple of other new people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3468.316s">And</a>  that night, typically we get an agenda and it tells us what's going to be on the agenda that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3475.118s">And</a>  we get the information that we can read through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3477.539s">So</a>  the night that you were here, you weren't on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3481.2s">I</a>  really haven't experienced a lot of people coming that aren't on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3485.342s">So</a>  I didn't have any information to even speak on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3488.923s">the</a>  evaluation of the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3491.124s">I</a>  know from my work experience where I work, I work at Mass Teachers Retirement System, and I work with over 40 school districts, and I hear from my payroll people all the time how upsetting it is when they see a superintendent go, because they get a superintendent when somebody retires, and the superintendents are coming and going all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3513.976s">And</a>  when they come and go, they also come in and they reorganize. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3518.565s">and</a>  they get their staff in there or their administration in there, and they set new rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3524.009s">So</a>  then it sends a lot of teachers off going and a lot of people moving out of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3528.673s">So</a>  I agree with my colleagues that we need to take a lot of time doing the search, because we don't want to get somebody from Chicago, which I've just heard from one of my school districts, because they lost their superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3541.303s">They</a>  got a new superintendent for two years after training the new superintendent, and now they have somebody from Chicago coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3548.223s">who</a>  doesn't know anything about their district. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3550.725s">So</a>  I think that it's going to take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3553.967s">I</a>  don't know how much time, but we do have coming up the 23rd, I thought it was, is the evening with the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3562.094s">That's</a>  for the public, where everybody can go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3565.076s">And</a>  we're invited to go as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3566.777s">And</a>  I'm going to take notes, because what I heard was that we could take notes at the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3571.421s">And</a>  all of the meetings in all the past have been public meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3575.624s">So</a>  all the minutes are available. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3577.655s">which</a>  is transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3580.836s">Honestly,</a>  I didn't have time to go and look for all those meeting minutes, but it's all available at any time for anybody to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3588.277s">It's</a>  just a matter of, I know where I work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3590.497s">We</a>  have to go into the archive bulletins. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3592.818s">It</a>  might be something like that because we have so much data to go into the websites. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3596.698s">It</a>  might be in a different area that we might have to reach somebody in the IT or the technical office to find out exactly where they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3604.42s">Honestly,</a>  I don't know, but no, I think <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3607.197s">You</a>  know, it's definitely something we have to consider and take a lot of time to do the search to actually get another superstar like Roy, because he's been doing a terrific job. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3616.28s">You</a>  know, students rave about what he's doing, parents rave about what he's doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3621.661s">You</a>  know, we have a lot of good, positive feedback, and I do appreciate everything you've said, and I hope you got my email when I responded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3629.643s">I</a>  did, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3630.304s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Angela Moore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3632.47s">not</a>  here specifically discussing Superintendent Belson's contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3636.071s">I'm</a>  here speaking about a plan that should be in place, like what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3640.412s">You</a>  don't want someone to come in and then have it not work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3643.193s">So</a>  you need a plan in place so that if you do need to replace someone, there's certain steps that you go by. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3650.015s">If</a>  there is a process, it should be public. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3652.276s">Like</a>  you said, there is a process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3653.476s">Well,</a>  I have no idea what that process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3655.837s">And</a>  when I stood here on April 11th, nobody shared with me what that process was. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3660.028s">Nobody</a>  said, there will be this, there will be X, Y, and Z, and by June 30th, we will have something to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3667.071s">That's</a>  transparency.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3669.352s">And</a>  I just went to a training along with a couple of my colleagues, and we went to the training. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3674.974s">It's</a>  for new school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3678.515s">So</a>  I received the certification probably, I think, two weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3684.178s">I</a>  don't remember the exact date. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3685.958s">Yeah,</a>  it was actually the day before Mother's Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3687.699s">So</a>  it was not this week, it was the week before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3690.147s">and</a>  we got a booklet and we, you know, there's a lot of information that we have available, including help from the MASC to conduct a superintendent search. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3700.175s">They</a>  assist with the superintendent search and they gave us a little, you know, a little handout. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3706.24s">So</a>  they also can help us conduct the search. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3711.144s">And</a>  with any questions that we have as a committee, you know, to help us with the search. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3715.188s">Now</a>  I'm not experienced with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3717.149s">I've</a>  never done it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3718.29s">And</a>  I don't know if any of the colleagues here have done it because Mr. Belson has been the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3724.215s">So</a>  I think it's going to be new for all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3727.277s">You</a>  know, at the same time, it's going to be a work in process where <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3730.503s">you</a>  know, I think we're all going to learn from this experience and like we've been doing with all the other procedures, we've been documenting and we've been writing instructions and new procedures and we've been reviewing the procedures as a group before we make a motion to put it on the table before we publish it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3749.172s">And</a>  we've been, you know, doing that, you know, as we, I mean, during committee of the whole meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3755.254s">Um,</a>  so I think it's, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3756.759s">It</a>  is, you know, definitely in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3759.4s">I</a>  think, you know, where it's so close to the superintendent night and so close to his evaluation, I, you know, I wish the timing was different and we had some more answers for you tonight, but I'm very glad that you've come out, you know, to talk to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3773.366s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3774.166s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3777.475s">So</a>  I just want to back up for a second and remind everybody here that actually I've been through two superintendent searches already, but first for Superintendent DeVoe, an outside candidate, and secondly for Superintendent Belson, who was an internal candidate at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3793.655s">So</a>  I've actually got a little bit of experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3796.677s">Also,</a>  I just want to assure everybody that there is no way, and I kind of recoil from your word haphazard, that I would allow this to be a haphazard process for picking the most important job that we have in our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3813.75s">In</a>  fact, if you go back, when I ran for school committee this time, one of the things I talked about was that we will be entering a transition period. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3822.617s">and</a>  it will be vitally important that we take our time and we do due diligence and we have a very successful transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3832.863s">And</a>  that's particularly because I am involved and have been involved on the statewide level at the MASC and we've talked to our colleagues from other districts who've done superintendent searches and we've gotten, Anne Marie and I have gotten some pretty good feedback <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3848.632s">We've</a>  also had the opportunity to talk, you know, they will do superintendent searches. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3855.156s">There</a>  is a process with them that we could choose to, at the time, ask for their assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3862.1s">Of</a>  course, no decision like that has been made, but we are well aware of that as a potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3867.182s">By</a>  the way, Angela, I did want to tell you that I did not receive an email from you, and that's been a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3871.925s">Somehow</a>  emails that are sent directly to the school are not coming to me, so use my Gmail address. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3877.814s">please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3879.135s">So</a>  again, no way would I allow someone with 26 years of experience on the Medford School Committee, who lives and breathes this job, would I allow this to be a haphazard process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3892.781s">I</a>  also want to remind everybody that this year, we've had three new school committees join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3899.044s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3899.244s">Kreatz,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3900.477s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3900.697s">Mostoni,</a>  and in fact the mayor, is new. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3903.7s">They</a>  joined us in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3905.602s">That</a>  was not the time to spring into action to do the superintendent's evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3911.167s">They</a>  needed an opportunity to work with the superintendent and find out for themselves what kind of man he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3921.419s">You</a>  don't just go and evaluate somebody who you've only worked for for six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3929.748s">So</a>  our evaluation process is a little later this year, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3933.432s">It</a>  is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3934.954s">The</a>  evening with the superintendent is going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3937.977s">I</a>  would have it no other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3943.498s">Sometimes</a>  it feels like there's another elephant in the room, and certainly there are some citizens that would prefer the superintendent not to perhaps indicate that he would like to stay another year or so on top of his current contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3959.544s">And</a>  it's all very interesting, this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3962.118s">The</a>  superintendent is a man who has to make some tough decisions, and he has to lead, and he's been our leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3968.6s">He</a>  has a backbone, and so he's spoken out about things like the drain of finances that was caused by our students going to Minuteman, and he worked hard to end that procession out and to, in fact, then booster our own Medford Vocational School so that it would be the jewel that it is growing to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3989.624s">We're</a>  so proud of that, such a change. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=3992.525s">He</a>  talks out on a statewide level about the inequity of charter school funding and the problems of the funding formula. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4000.469s">And</a>  every so often, he gets really pissed off, and he speaks inappropriately, perhaps, to a citizen, and that's my view, and I can tell every single one of you that when I feel he's crossed a line, I'm the first one to tell him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4016.397s">But</a>  he is a magnificent leader here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4019.125s">he</a>  will be hard to replace. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4021.988s">We</a>  will also need to look about and think very strongly about, and I've actually already had some discussions with the superintendent himself, which at some point along the line when we sit down, the whole school committee will have to consider not only his role, but what is the role of the other people who might, because he's leaving, decide to go with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4041.466s">It's</a>  a bigger picture than just the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4044.978s">Now,</a>  you said to us, why didn't we say anything to you in April? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4048.321s">We</a>  were coming up cold. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4049.401s">I</a>  didn't know you were coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4050.762s">I</a>  hadn't looked at the date on the superintendent's contract that night, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4054.985s">We</a>  had a school vacation week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4056.707s">We've</a>  gone through incredibly busy weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4058.888s">I</a>  don't know if people realize how busy this school committee is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4062.651s">One</a>  week I was out so many nights, and look, this is just, we're here today, May 16th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4067.735s">We</a>  have a meeting on May 17th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4069.096s">We</a>  have a meeting on May 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4070.277s">We</a>  have a meeting on May 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4071.558s">We</a>  have a meeting on May 24th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4073.34s">We</a>  have the M Club dinner on the 25th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4075.481s">We</a>  have 6th, 7th, 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4077.243s">We</a>  are incredibly busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4079.224s">It</a>  is, we have to get all of us together. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4081.666s">Now,</a>  should this be a priority? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4083.027s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4083.908s">But</a>  I would hold that we are taking our steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4086.791s">The</a>  superintendent will give us his evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4090.936s">We</a>  will deliberate on that evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4093.499s">We</a>  will ask him for his preferences regarding a contract and we will deliberate on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4099.045s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4100.245s">We</a>  will go through the extraordinary busy time of getting the budget, and we need to realize that the superintendent and his, everybody in the administration needs to spend time to put that budget together. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4115.008s">That's</a>  the time of year it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4116.688s">I</a>  assure you that this will not be a haphazard process, and I want to add, over my dead body.</p>

    <p>[Mea Quinn Mustone]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4138.543s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4138.763s">Mustone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4141.467s">Angela,</a>  thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4143.109s">I</a>  think what you've been saying is it's about the process and transparent, which I think we've been successful since January with a new security policy and that wouldn't have happened without parents' voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4153.622s">We</a>  have community schools discussion, that wouldn't have happened without parents' voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4157.366s">So</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4158.533s">Regardless,</a>  Mr. Bellson, I'm glad you're here and you're well right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4161.454s">We</a>  need to just have a policy that we can share with the community about how we're moving forward with dates, all those dates that we've rattled off that I haven't even kept track of. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4169.975s">So</a>  I want to thank Angela for being here for the other parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4172.395s">I'm</a>  interested in hearing them because it seems like things get done when it comes from the parents, not from us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4177.316s">So</a>  thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4178.517s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4179.817s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent would like to clarify some.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4183.557s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4186.538s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4188.668s">I've</a>  been here 21 years now as superintendent, 48 years as a public educator in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4196.75s">I</a>  grew up in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4197.95s">I</a>  went to the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4198.85s">I</a>  went to the Forest Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4200.95s">I</a>  went to the Roberts Junior High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4202.531s">I</a>  went to Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4205.671s">So</a>  this is my community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4208.392s">I</a>  care about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4209.772s">And</a>  as I've said before, I never intend or would never intend to make a decision that would leave my community <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4218.962s">in</a>  the lurch. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4221.082s">Now,</a>  having said that, we have had a process of evaluation and decision-making that has gone back well before my term as superintendent, and it's always been transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4235.625s">My</a>  self-evaluation will come to the committee this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4239.346s">You'll</a>  have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4240.446s">You'll</a>  have more than two weeks to go over it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4243.266s">That's</a>  a pretty substantial period of time to look at the document, which takes me time, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4248.369s">to</a>  produce and review given all the other responsibilities that we have in the school district. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4256.052s">The</a>  process will be in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4258.293s">It</a>  always is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4260.274s">Open</a>  session. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4260.954s">It's</a>  not an executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4262.375s">It's</a>  not away from anyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4265.336s">It's</a>  open and every committee member has an opportunity to say what they feel and make whatever ratings they want to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4274.28s">So</a>  far they've been good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4276.199s">I'm</a>  sure that there may be some things that people would like to see me do better, or the school system do better. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4283.482s">But</a>  clearly, it's been an open process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4286.483s">And</a>  as you can tell, people come to the rail all the time and make statements, give their opinions, come into meetings, some of them in support, and some of them critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4300.488s">But</a>  that's a balancing act. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4301.889s">Wherever</a>  we are, that's what takes place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4306.585s">What</a>  does concern me is this, and I say this in a very sincere way, and that's simply this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4315.911s">Whether</a>  I stay or go, when I go, if an outside individual is going to consider the Medford Public Schools as his or her home, as superintendent, they are going to evaluate the environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4331.26s">And</a>  if they feel the environment is hostile, they're not coming here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4336.318s">They're</a>  not coming here because it's a tough enough job not to be in a situation where people are divided and split along many issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4349.744s">So</a>  it's our responsibility to have a decent dialogue, to make an appropriate decision, but to keep it intelligent and to keep it <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4362.667s">welcoming,</a>  so that when someone does consider applying for the Medford Public Schools, they say, I want to go there, because that's a good place to be a superintendent of schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4374.054s">The</a>  people support the administration, they support their school committee, and there's mutual respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4381.319s">And</a>  so that's really what we've got to strive for. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4383.26s">A</a>  decision will be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4387.095s">Decision</a>  will happen in public session. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4389.476s">Decision</a>  will happen after a lot of consultation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4392.698s">And</a>  a lot of the things that we have to decide are based on, am I a person at this point in time able to bring forward our agenda in an intelligent way? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4402.682s">Or</a>  is someone else maybe better positioned to do that at this point in time? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4407.404s">That's</a>  what it's about. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4409.405s">That's</a>  what it's about. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4410.966s">So</a>  let's have our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4414.967s">Let's</a>  respect each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4416.893s">Let's</a>  continue to work together, and let's make a decision in a timely way on behalf of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4424.434s">Now,</a>  superintendent searches vary. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4427.455s">Many</a>  of them are done in a lot shorter time than a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4430.515s">But</a>  if that's the community's wish, then that's something we'd go forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4438.237s">But</a>  I've observed a lot of searches over the years, and people call me all the time because I've been around for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4445.475s">So</a>  I think that it's important we go through our process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4450.757s">It's</a>  also informative to go through the process, because the things I will bring to you in the self-evaluation will remind you of things you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4458.439s">Even</a>  when I'm writing up the evaluation myself, I'm saying to myself, oh, I forgot we did this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4462.98s">Oh,</a>  I forgot this actually happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4464.761s">Oh,</a>  this, yes, was a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4466.061s">Yes,</a>  we dealt with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4467.922s">It's</a>  a process of re-educating ourselves about all the things that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4471.966s">It's</a>  also a message that we send to our administration, faculty, and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4478.89s">And</a>  it's important that we do it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4481.152s">And</a>  it's important that we have the right kind of discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4484.754s">And</a>  that we not create a leverage situation where decisions are made on the fly, or decisions are made without proper dialogue and discussion and process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4496.481s">I'm</a>  very confident that you will do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4499.183s">And</a>  I'm very confident that we will have <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4502.037s">a</a>  good discussion and that a proper appropriate decision will be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4507.241s">So</a>  thank you for your ongoing support. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4513.365s">Thank</a>  you for your interest in perhaps making sure the community has a proper transition. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4518.869s">But</a>  at the same time, let's make sure we do it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4521.911s">And</a>  so you will get my self evaluation at the end of the week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4525.639s">And</a>  by the way, it's important that people respect the fact that you're the elected members of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4531.164s">You</a>  have a right to look at this stuff before the rest of the world comments on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4535.128s">You</a>  work with me all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4538.391s">And</a>  conversely, I believe I have a right to make sure that the people who work with me all the time get the first pass at commenting on what goes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4550.077s">I</a>  think we're in a good place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4551.759s">I</a>  think it will go well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4554.042s">And</a>  I think people will be pleased that a good transparent process has taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4560.451s">That's</a>  all we all want.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4586.553s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4588.014s">I</a>  want to also comment that there is a lot of support in the in the galley for the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4594.257s">I</a>  know that a lot of teachers heard that this was going to be on the agenda and in parents and they wanted to come out and show their support and that's why the room is full and it's very nice to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4604.561s">And</a>  there's also a lot of people here that just want to bring forward the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4609.263s">So</a>  in that, taking that into account, I motion that the superintendent provide us with his evaluation by Friday, May 20th, to all school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4624.369s">That's</a>  four days after I thought we were going to get it, but that's my first motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4629.171s">And</a>  my second motion is for us to meet on June 6th to <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4636.865s">to</a>  provide the superintendent with our feedback and his evaluation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4640.548s">Is</a>  the committee meeting scheduled for June 2nd? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4642.71s">Oh,</a>  2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4643.211s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4643.671s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4644.052s">That's</a>  what I'm trying to get is the date so it's clear to the whole committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4648.175s">So</a>  I would like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4649.437s">I'm</a>  making a motion to have that on the agenda so that the whole community knows when everything's going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4655.927s">about</a>  and if they need to come and make additional comments, they're welcome to come that evening and hear our evaluation as well of the superintendent that we do every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4665.311s">And</a>  then my last motion would be to have, as a committee, have a succession plan in process on the record by June 30th, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4677.076s">And</a>  it doesn't have to be, we as a committee have to provide the superintendent on that date <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4684.304s">whether</a>  we are extending his contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4687.325s">But</a>  in addition to that, this motion is about making ourselves accountable to a date to have a secession plan in place, whether or not we extend the superintendent's contract a year or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4702.328s">So</a>  that way, if something were to happen, and life things happen, we have a plan in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4709.994s">Mr.</a>  Belson is continuing on as our superintendent or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4713.816s">We</a>  can go back to that plan, just like a master plan, and put that in effect if anything were to arise at any moment's notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4721.98s">So</a>  I'm asking for a second to my motion of all three items.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4727.943s">There's</a>  a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4729.104s">If</a>  we could take them separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4730.505s">Motion</a>  for the self-evaluation to be provided to the school committee by Friday.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4736.203s">I</a>  have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4736.843s">I</a>  think that the contract reads that we have to inform the superintendent by June 30 if our intention is not to rehire him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4744.728s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4745.829s">It</a>  doesn't say not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4747.99s">Do</a>  you have a copy of it before? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4751.012s">I</a>  brought it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4752.493s">Could</a>  you just read the first sentence or that sentence?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4759.458s">Madam</a>  Mayor, would you like me to read it?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4761.159s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4761.499s">You're</a>  right at the line.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4773.091s">Okay,</a>  term. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4774.352s">The</a>  superintendent shall be employed for a two-year period commencing July 1st, 2015, ending June 30th, 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4782.536s">The</a>  school committee shall advise the superintendent of its intent to extend his contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4792.082s">The</a>  intent to extend his contract by June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4796.104s">We</a>  have to decide by that date whether we intend to extend it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4803.516s">that</a>  we intend to extend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4805.217s">If</a>  we do not tell him by that date, it also goes forward with the superintendent shall notify the school committee of his notice of obligation by September 1st, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4820.822s">Notice</a>  of school committee's intent to terminate the contract upon expiration must be given by certified mail, return address request to the superintendent at his address of records. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4833.007s">So</a>  we would have to, if as a committee we were not extending his contract, he would have to have notification to himself by June 30th, 2016 at his home address.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4848.861s">There's</a>  a motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4850.042s">There's</a>  a second by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4851.163s">Mostone</a>  on the first motion that Ms.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4854.406s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4858.154s">It</a>  says that we have to come up with a plan by June 30th also, is that your motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4862.676s">We'll</a>  take it one at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4864.417s">That's</a>  the second one, okay.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4865.157s">We're</a>  going to move them separately.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4867.338s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4867.478s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4867.598s">Vander</a>  Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4868.579s">So,</a>  you know, I don't have any problem voting for the motion, but the superintendent has just told us that he's going to provide it to us by Friday, and he's just told us that we've got a meeting on the second. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4879.624s">So,</a>  in fact, my colleague is, by putting it in motion, is making it sound as if <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4884.006s">You</a>  know, she's doing something like a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4886.767s">But</a>  I just have to be clear that we've already put out and said that we're going to be doing these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4891.769s">I</a>  have no problem voting for it because we just said we'd do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4894.69s">But,</a>  you know, I just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4898.772s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4900.292s">Well,</a>  it seems redundant to me.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4904.034s">That</a>  the self-evaluation be provided by Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4906.395s">It's</a>  seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4907.395s">Mostone.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4909.876s">Motion</a>  has been moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4911.016s">Roll</a>  call vote's been requested.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4913.187s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4913.408s">Cuno.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4914.009s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4915.853s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4916.655s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4917.257s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4917.437s">Kress.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4917.738s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4919.462s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4919.642s">Mostoma.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4920.324s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4920.785s">Mr.</a>  Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4921.306s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4921.607s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4921.787s">Van</a>  Der Poel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4922.389s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4924.183s">Yes,</a>  six in the affirmative, one in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4926.484s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4928.145s">The</a>  second item, which is, I've already called the Committee of the Whole June 2nd, 2016. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4932.267s">Is</a>  there a motion on the floor that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting on June 2nd, 2016? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4937.149s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4938.77s">Motion</a>  for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4942.471s">DiBenedetto,</a>  who made the offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4945.313s">Roll</a>  call.</p>

    <p>[Robert Skerry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4947.253s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4947.373s">Scugno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4947.674s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4947.834s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4948.954s">Benedetto.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4949.574s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4949.835s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4950.135s">Kreatz.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4950.475s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4951.316s">I</a>  think that there are many factors to a succession plan.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4975.663s">I</a>  am afraid that by saying, oh, we're going to have the whole thing done and created by June 30th is inappropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4983.371s">The</a>  piece that we need to do is we need to let the superintendent know, after he lets us know what he wants, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4991.34s">what</a>  our intent is with his contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=4993.482s">But</a>  there are many, many pieces, and to just define it by June 30th, when you know how many meetings, I mean, some of you have yet to go through a budget meeting and what other meetings we might have in the end of the school year business. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5005.573s">I</a>  have no problem meeting during the summer and working on a succession plan if we need be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5010.899s">I</a>  have no issue with that to tie us into a June 30th meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5017.564s">So,</a>  I think it would be more appropriate is to inform the superintendent upon our intent and then subsequently, I mean, to make, to create and affirm a succession plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5035.671s">I</a>  just have to tell you, I mean, there's many pieces to a succession plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5039.405s">And</a>  there's going to be many, many parts of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5041.846s">So</a>  I'm a little concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5043.387s">Absolute.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5044.387s">Oh,</a>  we're going to have the succession plan by June 30th.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5046.348s">I'm</a>  offering an amendment.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5049.629s">Um,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5052.73s">Uh,</a>  so that the, uh, could you just say how it read right now?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5056.171s">Original</a>  was that a succession plan be created by June 30th, 2016 point of information.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5062.114s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto, please succession plan slash process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5066.307s">So</a>  even if we come up with the succession plan process by June 30th and we start a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5072.851s">Why</a>  don't we say process rather than succession? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5074.972s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5075.653s">And</a>  another point of information, um, through you to my colleague, um, the superintendent isn't required to tell us if his intentions until September 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5085.779s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5086.435s">We</a>  might not know his intention by the time, that's how it's worded in this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5091.999s">I</a>  know it's awkward and awful, but that's how the contract is worded if I'm not mistaken. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5096.682s">And</a>  I don't think I am.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5099.904s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5100.165s">So</a>  that's why the word saying a process would be more appropriate because it gives us then the leeway of understanding the superintendent's role in informing us at a later date. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5111.693s">However,</a>  there is certainly no harm in us having discussions about <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5115.969s">all</a>  the different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5116.79s">And</a>  by the way, just one thing I do want to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5119.191s">You</a>  know, someone brought up their concern, and I absolutely understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5123.134s">What</a>  if something happened to the superintendent? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5126.216s">And</a>  for years and years and years, the biggest criticism I had of the superintendent, we used to say, delegate, you have to delegate, you have to delegate, because he seemed to be the guy who knew everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5137.903s">But</a>  one of the things, he's been very successful, and I have to say that he really, you know, he really listened to us, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5145.765s">He</a>  also speaks a lot shorter than he used to, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5148.546s">But</a>  the thing that he does now is he is delegated. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5152.489s">And</a>  so I know that, God forbid, something happened to the superintendent, that he has so many strong administrative people working for him and our principals and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5162.614s">It</a>  is not, I mean, I hope you understand in my saying this, Roy, that if he all of a sudden had a terrible accident that we would be left. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5170.958s">without</a>  leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5172.479s">That's</a>  not the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5174.02s">We</a>  have very strong leaders across the board, so many talented individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5179.583s">And</a>  believe me, that has been one of the things that, as I've watched the process over the years, has really changed, that I feel confident that we would not all of a sudden be rudderless in a storm.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5194.151s">So</a>  the motion has been changed by the author of the motion, Mr. Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5198.274s">I</a>  would like to change it <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5202.721s">to</a>  say a secession plan outline process would be completed by June 30, 2016 or developed by then. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5216.047s">I'm</a>  assuming that it's a working document. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5219.408s">I</a>  work a lot with IEPs and it's a working document. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5222.19s">You</a>  come and revisit it many times and make changes and add to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5226.502s">And</a>  that's how I look at this process.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5228.063s">Once</a>  a plan is established, you make changes over time.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5413.186s">I</a>  did, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5414.666s">I</a>  just think that more communication and more openness, it's not a bad thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5419.948s">The</a>  new mayor has a new start. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5421.848s">She's</a>  got a long way to go, a long way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5425.111s">And</a>  it's not bad to review. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5428.072s">Oh,</a>  and the overlap. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5429.873s">If</a>  you have the TV3, and I don't agree with having it up at the high school, you all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5433.674s">But</a>  if you do, I'm a person, I'm a citizen, I'm now going to be in that public building. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5437.416s">I'm</a>  going to be in the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5439.697s">There</a>  is overlap between, even if you don't have kids in the system, there's an overlap between the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5445.545s">and</a>  the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5446.845s">And</a>  that, oh, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5447.966s">I</a>  just want to say, Jean, you're a taxpayer.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5450.167s">Yes,</a>  that's right.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5451.007s">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5451.387s">I</a>  mean, you're a taxpayer, so you don't have to keep on saying, I don't have kids in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5455.028s">You</a>  are a taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5455.908s">You</a>  are a citizen of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5457.069s">You</a>  have every right to be concerned about the schools in our community as any other person, any parent, or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5463.891s">Well,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5464.491s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5465.151s">So</a>  I just wanted to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5467.897s">There's</a>  nothing wrong with asking the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5469.739s">And</a>  I think that every five years, somebody should be judging you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5472.382s">No</a>  offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5472.802s">Every</a>  year.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5473.383s">Every</a>  year? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5474.284s">Every</a>  year he's reviewed.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5475.425s">But</a>  it should come from some higher authority and not yourself.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5477.548s">Well,</a>  we are the higher authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5478.729s">We</a>  hire him.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5479.55s">Oh,</a>  you hire him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5480.13s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5480.611s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5480.931s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5481.292s">Yeah,</a>  but he's evaluating himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5482.533s">I</a>  don't get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5483.114s">He</a>  should. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5483.674s">He</a>  submits it to the body. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5487.258s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5487.498s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5488.099s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5489.995s">Well,</a>  that needs to happen, and it needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5492.457s">And</a>  I'm all for having it open. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5494.178s">The</a>  Charter Review, I'm all for open government, and I want to thank everybody for the transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5498.721s">It's</a>  a new day is dawning. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5500.563s">You</a>  got a job in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5502.024s">I</a>  don't envy you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5504.005s">And</a>  I'll see you guys later. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5505.786s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5506.167s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5506.707s">Martin.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5622.603s">Absolutely,</a>  because they're in charge of the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5625.324s">So</a>  I totally agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5627.345s">But</a>  I want to just say, instead of just one-on-one and cherry-picking, you know, that it needs to be body-to-body. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5633.609s">We</a>  need to have the whole body of the city council sit down with the whole body of the school committee and maybe under new leadership we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5640.193s">If</a>  you're doing the right thing, you will do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5641.954s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5706.007s">It</a>  doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5707.527s">A</a>  succession plan is a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5710.008s">It's</a>  irrespective of who's in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5713.669s">Whether</a>  Mr. Belson decides he wants to renew, retire, God forbid he's ill, doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5720.952s">And</a>  what hasn't been done, at least as far as Monique and I can tell, is you don't have a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5726.613s">And</a>  it's not dependent on what Mr. Belson decides to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5729.874s">It's</a>  just good common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5732.355s">I've</a>  checked other school districts before we got here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5736.657s">You'd</a>  be amazed how many school districts have a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5739.858s">Indeed,</a>  there's a quote from one of them that says, the lack of a plan is no plan at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5746.5s">So</a>  with that said, this is not a referendum on the elephant in the room, I think, as you put it, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5753.522s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5754.662s">Whether</a>  Mr. Belson goes, stays, how well he's done, it's a separate issue to be determined by the school committee, by the parents, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5764.462s">all</a>  concerned, we want to talk about the succession plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5769.886s">In</a>  the corporate world, the schools would be the public company. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5775.45s">The</a>  taxpayers would be your investors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5778.192s">Stop</a>  me if this analogy isn't working for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5782.675s">The</a>  shareholders are the Medford taxpayers who want to see a return on their investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5789.339s">Many</a>  of us are parents here of children. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5791.241s">We</a>  want to see them achieve their potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5794.055s">And</a>  we want the schools to continue to improve their accountability results. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5799.118s">The</a>  school committee is the company's board of directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5803.561s">And</a>  in the corporate world, they're charged with ensuring responsible governance and the ongoing continuity of the company. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5811.426s">If</a>  a company that was public did not have a succession plan, they would be guilty of malfeasance and could be charged by their shareholders and by the government. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5821.605s">with</a>  failing to adhere to several statutes that I can think of. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5826.466s">So</a>  why this is such a matter of contention, we don't get this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5832.707s">Whether</a>  you were defensive or not, I know it's difficult, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5835.968s">Cunha,</a>  to sit and listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5838.609s">Our</a>  sons run track together. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5840.769s">We</a>  appreciate everything that you do, all of you, day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5844.97s">It's</a>  not about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5846.49s">So</a>  hearing this is really troubling. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5850.462s">you're</a>  either going to do the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5852.603s">And</a>  I'm sorry if you don't like that phrase, or you're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5858.607s">So</a>  the board is also responsible for ensuring the school committee the performance of the CEO. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5866.231s">And</a>  in this analogy, obviously, that's Mr. Belson. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5870.233s">Him</a>  meeting the standards that you define and that he defines for himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5873.575s">He's</a>  not going to, I'm sure, define standards he doesn't think he should be meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5878.531s">And</a>  finding out if he doesn't do that, as someone pointed out, holding him accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5883.435s">It</a>  shouldn't matter who is at the helm. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5885.737s">So</a>  the goal of the shareholders, the parents, the community at large, is it fair to ask if you folks really feel that you know, as your shareholders, what the parents and the community at large really want from the district? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5903.792s">Do</a>  you feel you truly understand that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5906.414s">Have</a>  you done any surveys? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5908.65s">I</a>  know you talk to parents all the time, God knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5911.933s">You</a>  know, Paulette, she's everywhere and does a great job, and I know the rest of you do, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5917.357s">But</a>  do you know that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5918.498s">Have</a>  you actually polled them? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5919.578s">Have</a>  you spoken with them in a matter that you could publish and say, you know what, the majority of people seem to want A, B, C, D? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5927.965s">Because</a>  the succession plan is supposed to have that, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5930.607s">It's</a>  not just supposed to be about replacing Mr. Belson should he leave or go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5934.79s">It's</a>  supposed to be about <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5936.544s">We</a>  need a plan to achieve X with a person who's going to hold this job, who's capable of doing A, B, C, D, E, except the A through E ain't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5945.949s">At</a>  least not as far as we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5951.012s">So</a>  what about the goals of the teachers and the other staff? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5954.494s">I</a>  see them all here tonight, and I'm really glad they're expressing support for Mr. Belson, but again, this isn't about him. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5960.897s">This</a>  is about governance, simple governance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5967.459s">What</a>  about the goals of the administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5969.28s">Mr.</a>  Belson's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5970.16s">He</a>  has a perfect right to define what we should be doing as a school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5975.723s">And</a>  that should be for Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5977.284s">Caldwell</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5978.124s">Nelson</a>  and the principals. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5980.565s">But</a>  it's not in a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5982.846s">Not</a>  that we know of. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5983.727s">Not</a>  a succession plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5986.128s">And</a>  it should be based on all of the above and you should have a recruiting plan for it regardless of why. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5990.91s">It</a>  should be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5993.011s">You</a>  should know, Mr. Belson said, some take longer, some don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=5998.337s">Just</a>  have the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6000.818s">So</a>  telling me that there's good superintendents, I know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6006.58s">We</a>  work with Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6007.3s">Caldwell</a>  in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6008.561s">She's</a>  excellent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6009.901s">But</a>  that said, knowing that you have people in place, that's a contingency. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6015.824s">That's</a>  not a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6018.485s">Am</a>  I wrong? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6022.206s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6023.027s">I</a>  just wanted to know I was in office. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6024.647s">My</a>  wife tells me in outer space. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6029.785s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6030.646s">So</a>  look, Monique and I really appreciate you listening to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6033.627s">We're</a>  already going in the step in the right direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6036.649s">So</a>  the dates kind of don't matter to us, but the good plan really does. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6041.772s">We</a>  would ask you to find a mechanism to survey the parents and the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6048.096s">It's</a>  unfortunate we don't get as many people as we could, but you and I both know, not a lot of people show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6054.398s">Same</a>  people to the PTO, same people to the meetings, but there's a lot of good-hearted parents out there who give you information if you ask for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6062.445s">So,</a>  Monique, I don't know if you have anything you want to add, but it's unusual. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6069.992s">We</a>  thank you for listening to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6071.473s">Do</a>  you have any questions of us?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6074.747s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6074.947s">Van</a>  der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6076.067s">So,</a>  Bob, one thing I just want to mention to you is that our thinking actually isn't that far apart, because recently I attended the National School Board Conference, and I said to Anne Marie, who was with me at the time, come on, come on, we have to go down and talk to these people, because the topic was how to successfully survey your school population so it's meaningful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6099.796s">And</a>  so that's very much been part of my thinking of sort of saying that it is time <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6103.65s">I</a>  believe, to reach out and to send a survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6105.911s">But,</a>  you know, surveys can be useless and they can be powerful. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6110.814s">And</a>  that's, so that was my thinking about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6115.177s">I</a>  do want to mention to you also that we do establish goals every fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6120.92s">We</a>  talk about them publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6122.601s">We</a>  argue about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6124.422s">And</a>  those are our guiding lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6126.763s">Again,</a>  personally, I think now we're clearly at the place where we need a succession, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6131.807s">to</a>  talk about this and I will just assure you that it will happen.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6136.532s">Can</a>  I ask a question?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6137.574s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6137.994s">Do</a>  parents have to live to your goals?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6140.577s">I</a>  certainly think they should.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6141.918s">Do</a>  they? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6144.257s">Do</a>  they have input?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6145.478s">Well,</a>  Bob, you know, every year we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6148.338s">Every</a>  year, you know, we have three people in the audience.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6151.259s">So</a>  let me suggest, knowing that, because we both know that that's the case, that what you just did, going to find out what that is, find a better mechanism. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6161.282s">Don't</a>  rely upon people to show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6162.842s">You</a>  know they're not going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6164.763s">You</a>  guys are given all these nights and you must obviously feel very tired about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6169.028s">But</a>  I'll bet you that if you gave people an online mechanism to respond that was anonymous, if you need help with that, let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6176.271s">It</a>  can be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6177.812s">With</a>  that said, a last comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6179.953s">Angela</a>  Moore got up here and did a very, very difficult thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6183.335s">She</a>  did it at the school committee and she did it as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6186.636s">Somehow</a>  it got conflated with Mr. Bilson. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6189.418s">It</a>  wasn't about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6191.266s">Because</a>  I spoke to Angela after this was in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6195.829s">Her</a>  goal was to make this a process that was happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6199.871s">So</a>  I just want to commend her for coming, facing, I won't say the lion's den, but it wasn't easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6207.335s">So</a>  thank you, Angela.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6219.201s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6219.342s">How</a>  are you doing?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6220.593s">Hi,</a>  can you name and address, please?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6221.954s">My</a>  name is Vince Master Mateo, 10 Schoolhouse Road, Bedford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6225.956s">I'm</a>  here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6226.777s">This</a>  is the first time I've been in a school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6229.078s">I</a>  have three young kids in the school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6232.08s">And</a>  my biggest, I have a lot of things I wanted to say, but I'm probably going to hold back for most of them tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6237.483s">But</a>  the biggest thing that concerns me as a young parent with a lot of young kids is, and a lot of people my age that are moving out of Medford to towns like Andover or Winchester, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6249.175s">is</a>  the school ranking, 70 out of 75. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6252.517s">And</a>  that's one of the things during the succession thing that we're talking about, what's the game plan to make it better than 70? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6261.203s">And</a>  how do we do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6262.384s">And</a>  how can we in the community help? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6265.706s">And</a>  those are the things that I think are most critical, because at the end of the day, really, that's the most important thing.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6270.609s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6274.752s">So</a>  please just take that into consideration.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6279.64s">I</a>  just want to say as far as the plan, I mean, we haven't sat down and we are going to sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6284.481s">You're</a>  absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6287.522s">It's</a>  not that, I mean, having a superintendent search without any type of input from either community parents, teachers, administrators, or anyone from those categories, and including students, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6303.322s">would</a>  be crazy for us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6306.524s">I</a>  mean, I'm only basing it on what we've done and what the superintendent has done the last few times, even when we've hired assistant principals or principals or the director of the vocational school or our director of finance, is that we have had <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6322.127s">That</a>  particular plan, and I'm not sure if everyone is aware of that, is that the superintendent and the assistant superintendents have gotten together, have made a list of qualified people, and once that was set, then we had <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6338.074s">groups</a>  of people that we never even got involved with until it went through all the groups that were on a one-to-one basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6346.362s">So</a>  I'm looking forward to the fact that that's the type of plan or part of the plan of the groups that we'd want to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6354.369s">We</a>  definitely have to have the input of the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6358.212s">We</a>  have to have input of the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6359.774s">We</a>  have to have input of our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6361.796s">They're</a>  the ones that are going to be in the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6363.768s">We're</a>  here as elected officials, we understand our position of what we have to do, but we need to collect all that data before we could really go and just make a decision of who's coming and who's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6375.317s">So,</a>  I mean, to address your concerns about, I mean, I know that Paulette just mentioned it, but I want to reiterate the fact that there is no way that we could or will pick someone else when the time comes without the input of the people involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6392.41s">It</a>  has to be.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6393.421s">And</a>  thank you very much for that, but I was going a step before that, which was help in defining what the goals of the person you're seeking ought to be accomplishing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6405.348s">So</a>  what that means is, what are the priorities of the young parents at Bedford? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6410.43s">I'm</a>  an old guy at this point, but you've got people who have people in kindergarten, kids in kindergarten. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6416.214s">Mia,</a>  God bless you, with six children, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6418.515s">I</a>  mean, so I'm really getting at a point of, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6422.662s">Medford</a>  is changing, and it's changing for the better through the hard work of a lot of good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6428.247s">They</a>  don't feel they have input. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6429.949s">I've</a>  talked to a lot of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6431.47s">Not</a>  because you're stopping them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6432.971s">They</a>  don't know how to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6434.793s">I'm</a>  asking you show them how to say, these are my priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6437.956s">This</a>  is what I want from the system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6440.538s">Because</a>  I know you'll take that into account, and then you go search for a person who has done that, can show he or she has done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6448.369s">and</a>  meet it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6449.009s">To</a>  just search for a superintendent with credentials is only half the battle. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6452.451s">Would</a>  you agree?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6453.351s">And</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6453.991s">And</a>  as far as I mean, having, it's, it's unfortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6456.633s">Go</a>  ahead.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6460.374s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6462.335s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6464.176s">Um,</a>  I just wanted to, to address the, the, the gentleman that was just at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6471.119s">Um,</a>  I want to, I know you asked, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6473.96s">I</a>  know you asked about what, um, we were doing about our, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6478.542s">our</a>  level and my colleague is the head of the academic affairs committee and I requested that we hold a committee meeting so that way we could discuss our next steps because we are a level three school district and we need to have a plan in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6496.787s">Yeah,</a>  I know it upsets you, it upsets me too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6500.371s">We</a>  have to have a... What does level three mean?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6502.353s">So</a>  when your MCAS school is in, it's like you're leveling. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6505.536s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6505.696s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6506.096s">And</a>  it has to do with the ranking as well.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6508.198s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6508.658s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6509.239s">So</a>  we did a committee of the whole to go over ways that we can address, figure out what the exact needs are, what we need to do, and what next steps are to help us <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6522.252s">And</a>  I'm going to stop talking now and let the committee chair speak a little bit more about it directly, because we just did this recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6531.795s">So</a>  as a committee, we know that that's an issue and that we are bringing that forward.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6535.677s">The</a>  biggest thing is, again, for someone like me, I have three kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6539.378s">I'd</a>  rather not have to spend $100,000 a kid for high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6544.06s">I'd</a>  rather just use my tax dollars and make Medford a better school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6548.36s">And</a>  that's one of the reasons I'm here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6550.641s">I</a>  do want to make Medford better. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6552.621s">And</a>  I know a lot of younger parents do as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6554.762s">But</a>  like in business, when you're ranked 70th out of 75, heads roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6561.403s">And</a>  people need to be accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6563.544s">And</a>  this is the kind of time to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6565.805s">And</a>  I get caught on the carpet in my work all the time when my rankings aren't where they need to be.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6571.862s">So,</a>  as my colleague said, we had a meeting about a curriculum subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6576.926s">Now,</a>  I need to clarify something, and part of the problem is this is very, very complex, and if you just go on and you just look at a ranking, it will totally lead you in ways that are not correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6588.856s">First</a>  of all, my colleague mentioned we're level three. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6592.279s">Well,</a>  we have one school which is in level three. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6595.441s">We</a>  were one point away from being level two. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6597.442s">They</a>  can't tell us what we did wrong so that we get level two, but that's part of the complexity of it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6602.366s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6602.666s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6603.206s">We</a>  are a level one high school and have been so for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6606.949s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6607.569s">So</a>  we're doing awfully good somehow or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6610.051s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6612.973s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6614.789s">when</a>  you look at these you do have to look at if you there so much uh studies have been done and information is sort of like uh the the uh level of uh of your socioeconomic and your economic standard throughout the city hey i know i know you're gonna you know you know more about your area right now and you can you know you can talk to me and i don't i don't know what you're talking about my point is</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6639.053s">It's</a>  just that's why young kids like me are leaving Medford to go to other places where they're just better school system.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6644.814s">And</a>  for years and years and years, one of the things which has been so difficult for me is I see young families have leaving because they think there's a holy grail someplace else. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6653.716s">And</a>  that's what I've worked for on this committee for all these years of saying that we've got it in Medford and we can do great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6660.317s">The</a>  biggest difficulty is when we have a meeting, we discuss these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6665.682s">and</a>  nobody shows up. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6667.363s">And</a>  so how do I get the information to you so that you can talk to your neighbors and friends about how we're getting out? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6676.706s">And</a>  one of the things we did was, with great controversy, we just brought in a person to do publicity for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6683.308s">Because</a>  we understand that one of the biggest problems we have is there are so many good things happening in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6689.25s">If</a>  you were here earlier, you saw one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6691.51s">But</a>  getting it out is tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6693.91s">The</a>  publicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6695.233s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6697.477s">What</a>  was your question?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6699.941s">I</a>  lost my train of thought.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6701.244s">What</a>  was the good thing?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6703.227s">Just</a>  for the publicity, is that what every school does? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6705.749s">Hires</a>  a publicity agent?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6707.249s">Many</a>  school systems have now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6708.87s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6709.671s">Many</a>  school systems have.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6710.691s">I'm</a>  pretty old. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6711.132s">I</a>  don't remember having that when I was in school.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6712.993s">One</a>  of the things that she does is she has a blog because we realize, I mean, how do we reach parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6719.256s">Well,</a>  we have to do it with the way that parents are looking at media now, and that's through a blog. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6724.059s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6726.72s">You</a>  know, the highlights of Medford is not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6729.301s">Does</a>  not work. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6730.501s">So</a>  we are trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6731.282s">I</a>  mean, we're trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6732.142s">The</a>  communication is key.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6732.982s">Well,</a>  the parents need to do better, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6734.263s">I'm</a>  here to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6734.963s">That's</a>  why I'm here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6736.083s">So,</a>  you know.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6736.723s">Well,</a>  I would look forward to talking to another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6738.964s">I</a>  didn't get your information, but I'd love to further conversation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_26]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6741.405s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6742.085s">I'll</a>  send you an email. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6742.986s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6743.306s">Gmail</a>  account, right?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6744.226s">P.</a>  VanderKloof.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6924.029s">I</a>  just want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who came out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6927.531s">We</a>  know this is a very important topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6929.292s">We're</a>  not taking it lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6930.833s">The</a>  process is starting and there are meetings scheduled and we promise you that we will do our due diligence, include the public in different fashions so that we're able to reach out to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6940.26s">But</a>  thank you all for being here tonight on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6942.621s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6952.507s">Motion</a>  on the floor to revert to the regular order of business. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6954.749s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6956.25s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6957.791s">Motion</a>  is granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6958.792s">Report</a>  of committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6960.193s">Subcommittee</a>  meeting on building and grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6962.534s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6962.735s">Cugno.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6966.826s">The</a>  buildings and grounds subcommittee was called to order at 7.05 by the chairperson, myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6972.572s">Subcommittee</a>  members present were Kathy Kreatz and Paulette Van der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6976.195s">Also</a>  present were school committee members, Aaron DiBenedetto and Robert Scari, Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6980.719s">Also,</a>  Superintendent Roy E. Belson, Director of <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6983.658s">I'm</a>  sorry, also Superintendent Roy E. Belson, Director of Finance and Administration, Patricia Villa, Director of Buildings and Grounds, John McLaughlin, Assistant Director of PE, Health and Community Schools, Rachel Perry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=6996.525s">Community</a>  members present include Katie Martin from the Mephits Orca, and Dennis McDonald of the Office of Energy and Environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7007.05s">We</a>  all rose to salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7008.731s">Chairperson</a>  myself asked the superintendent to explain the purpose of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7012.973s">The</a>  superintendent explained the purpose as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7015.417s">Review</a>  the specification conditions for the proposed winter season bubble on Edgeley Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7021.886s">Review</a>  the proposed facilities, rental agreement, and fee schedule for the Medford Community Schools Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7027.935s">The</a>  superintendent informed the subcommittee of two additional comments that must be discussed as we go forward with discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7035.382s">OCD</a>  director Lauren DiLorenzo explained that since federal CDB HUD funds were used to remove architectural barriers from the entrance and exit to the field, the use of the bubble would <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7048.414s">have</a>  to make the same accessibility provisions as the pool. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7052.157s">This</a>  means that the facility must take provisions for low-income and disabled users. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7057.681s">Also,</a>  any profits might have to go back and reimburse HUD funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7064.05s">Ken</a>  Kraus raised several environmental concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7067.454s">Need</a>  to construct the proposed parking lot with appropriate stormwater management techniques, possible impact on the fells, and the size and location of the field house. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7078.589s">Possible</a>  impact upon Winthrop Street development. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7082.978s">Dennis</a>  McDougall from the Energy and Environment Office suggested that installations of the appropriate drainage as part of the parking lot was a must. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7092.06s">He</a>  also would have preferred pavers as an alternative to hardtop for the parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7097.401s">He</a>  recognized that the cost would be very high. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7100.382s">Superintendent</a>  explained that Winthrop Street development has not even been submitted and that it would not affect the parking area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7107.444s">Also,</a>  the field house size had not yet been established, but it would probably be about 1,000 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7113.606s">The</a>  parking lot would not be adjacent to the Middlesex Fells area. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7118.09s">The</a>  committee then began a review of RFP guidelines for the bubble structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7122.534s">The</a>  committee took the following actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7125.017s">Added</a>  the words with appropriate drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7128.18s">Specified</a>  the fieldhouse have at least two toilets in each of the male and female bathroom areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7135.047s">Further</a>  that they be handicapped accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7138.31s">required</a>  the vendor and contractor to hold a four-hour open house at least once during the season for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7145.075s">This</a>  would be listed as number 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7148.017s">There</a>  was considerable discussion on how the schedule of the bubble could provide more time for community use. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7153.841s">Suggestions</a>  included such ideas as having the contractor start later on Wednesdays, adding a later finishing time in exchange for more time in the afternoon and weekends, sharing space during contractor time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7167.69s">These</a>  ideas were rejected for several reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7171.051s">There</a>  was concern that the hours available would not be conducive for parents to bring children and youth to the facility during the afternoon hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7180.835s">There</a>  was discussion that the facility could provide opportunities for adult residents, like the pool does. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7186.897s">For</a>  example, there could be tennis, golf, track-related activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7190.878s">While</a>  the adult use was understood, the committee was trying to find more time for children and youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7196.866s">Ultimately,</a>  the committee opted to include a four-hour open house requirement once per season. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7202.768s">On</a>  the motion of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7203.589s">Van</a>  der Kloot, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7205.049s">Kreatz,</a>  the subcommittee voted 3-0 to forward and recommend the amended RFP guidelines to the full school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7214.106s">You</a>  can see that attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7215.747s">The</a>  subcommittee then began its review of the proposed facilities rental agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7220.23s">Director</a>  of Finance and Administration took the subcommittee through each page. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7224.913s">Discussion</a>  was held at intervals as each member raised questions and or made suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7230.576s">The</a>  following represents the changes made by the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7235.376s">The</a>  liability insurance requirement was changed to maybe from it is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7240.48s">The</a>  age of 21 was submitted for the word minors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7243.823s">On</a>  page four, the time of activity termination was changed from 11.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7248.587s">to</a>  11 o'clock p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7250.528s">Hormel</a>  Stadium line was altered as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7253.691s">Hormel</a>  Stadium rentals are controlled by the Hormel Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7257.113s">Contact</a>  information <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7259.595s">7,</a>  8, 1, 3, 9, 3, 2, 3, 8, 0. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7262.097s">Under</a>  pool fees, the resident fee for birthday parties was raised to $275—actually, while I'm reading this, I just wanted a clarification on this—raised to $275 from $125 per hour, or was it—I don't—if I just want to ask Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7278.231s">Because</a>  then it also says, the birthday party rental included up to two lifeguards. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7282.634s">If</a>  the swimmer numbers exceed 20, then additional lifeguards and apical costs will apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7288.838s">On</a>  page 7, the rental fees for Edgley Field were changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7291.7s">Categories</a>  1, 2, 3 remained at $145 per hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7296.183s">Category</a>  4, for-profit, went to $185. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7300.286s">Non-resident,</a>  non-profit, went to $165. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7303.669s">Under</a>  food service fees, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7305.67s">The</a>  words added, with exception of birthday potties. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7308.772s">The</a>  chip, myself, called for a 10-minute recess. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7312.734s">Members</a>  were asked to review the last three pages of the proposal, which contained the faculty, the facility usage request form, and the release identification agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7322.72s">The</a>  subcommittee convened and agreed that the forms looked good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7326.422s">They</a>  will be reviewed by legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7328.803s">On</a>  the motion of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7329.584s">Van</a>  der Kloot, seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7330.864s">Kreatz,</a>  the subcommittee voted <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7332.245s">to</a>  recommend the facilities rental agreement proposal as amended to the full school committee, three to zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7338.77s">The</a>  subcommittee then received the financial reports on community schools, the pool, Edgeley Field, La Conte Ring, and again, see the attached overview of financial documents are on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7350.203s">In</a>  addition to the report, the materials presented to the subcommittee asked to receive the following information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7356.165s">Names</a>  of identities that have been given free space. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7360.786s">Names</a>  of employees who have worked the pool, field, and rink. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7363.947s">Clear</a>  breakout of pending review. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7367.669s">The</a>  subcommittee on the motion, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7369.089s">Kreatz,</a>  seconded by Ms. <a

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7376.251s">So</a>  we have clarification on that?</p>

    <p>[Molly Laden]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7377.712s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rachel Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7379.202s">The</a>  birthday parties were $200 for Medford residents, and you voted that we would raise that to $275 for non-residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7387.988s">So</a>  that $200 includes the rental of the pool for an hour, the cafeteria for an hour, and two lifeguards. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7395.133s">If</a>  there's more than 20 swimmers, we have to put another lifeguard on, and that would be an extra $25. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7399.216s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7400.477s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7401.617s">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7433.559s">In</a>  the IRP list?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7435.661s">So</a>  in the list that Anne-Marie just read on the third page, it's mentioned on the second page, but it's not included. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7445.029s">The</a>  following represents the changes made by the subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7448.912s">So</a>  that should be number eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7454.757s">So</a>  if I could ask for a correction on that.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7457.299s">Motion</a>  for correction, Mr. Superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7462.883s">If</a>  we could just sever this paper, the first item being the bubble, there's a motion of Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7468.088s">Vandekloot,</a>  seconded by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7469.109s">Kreatz</a>  in the subcommittee meeting, that you voted 3-0 to forward and recommend the amended RFP guidelines to the full school committee as amended by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7478.417s">Vandekloot</a>  on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7481.14s">On</a>  that motion to accept the RFP as amended</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7485.683s">Mister</a>  Bennett. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7486.623s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7487.564s">I</a>  reviewed this and it's really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7490.685s">There's</a>  just the RFP that is attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7494.207s">If</a>  we could look at number seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7496.868s">It</a>  says there should be sufficient insurance coverage borne by the vendor to cover any liability damage or liability The city must be held harmless all employees of the contractor who work on-site must be quarry checked and then it goes on to say Appropriate security. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7512.794s">Can</a>  we just define what appropriate is so that way there's no error in understanding with with the vendor So</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7523.005s">Remember,</a>  and this is something that was misunderstood, and I heard this at a council meeting, that this is not the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7529.887s">These</a>  are guidelines to the procurement office to develop an RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7535.689s">So</a>  they need to flesh out the specifics of security or other things, because if we get too tight right now, in their process, they may not be able to put something together that is appropriate for a vendor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7550.233s">If</a>  you set up a security plan that's around the clock or something like that, they may say that's prohibitive, no one's going to bid on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7556.961s">We've</a>  got to get something from procurement, let them check with other people as to what's likely to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7562.828s">The</a>  same thing is true of other elements of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7565.671s">This</a>  is guidance to the procurement officer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7568.895s">Remember,</a>  the procurement is going to come back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7571.725s">You're</a>  going to see the actual document. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7573.907s">So</a>  this is really guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7575.448s">Let</a>  the procurement officer actually spell out a little title and you'll be better off. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7579.651s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7579.991s">Just</a>  in general for insurance coverage, there's stipulations that go into all the contracts we write and that would be what will be in the RFP, not what we've written here.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7587.697s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7588.138s">And</a>  I also just want to bring it to attention that these are items that I'll be looking at as, as bids come in and I want to take, have to meet the minimum bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7596.544s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7596.864s">And</a>  this, and then number 12, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7599.757s">It's</a>  the end of the season. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7602.878s">They</a>  have to deliver the field in the same condition as it was before. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7607.079s">I'd</a>  like to have a certified evaluator to look at the field at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7611.561s">Just</a>  to be more specific, not just anyone from the school department walking through who doesn't really understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7619.503s">how</a>  the field was. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7620.204s">We</a>  can do that outside of the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7621.745s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7621.825s">That</a>  could be our internal procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7623.666s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7624.147s">As</a>  long as it's understood that, you know, I just want to make sure we do it right in the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7628.91s">I</a>  don't want to come back and say, I wish we added that word or just change those little issues.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7634.975s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7635.235s">Just</a>  one more thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7636.095s">You</a>  know, there are a lot of stories and comments being made outside of us that sometimes mislead the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7642.961s">And</a>  I want to make sure we clarify, just as we talked about, this was not the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7646.623s">This</a>  was the guidelines for the development of an RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7649.562s">Now,</a>  the second piece is that there was some comment at a council meeting that dealt with the cleaning of the fields, that no deep cleaning had taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7658.745s">That's</a>  not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7660.145s">We</a>  actually have the invoices. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7661.646s">We</a>  actually have the procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7662.946s">And</a>  we actually have the details that they did a deep cleaning on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7668.388s">So</a>  I want to make that clear that, you know, some people say things and, you know, they may think it's true, but we have backup information, which I can provide to you at a subsequent time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7679.192s">which</a>  shows that a deep cleaning was actually done, and the process and procedures spelled out as to what a deep cleaning actually is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7686.594s">So</a>  just for your information, in case you're asked, we've been doing deep cleanings because it was associated that if we didn't do deep cleanings, the longevity of the field would be compromised. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7696.616s">We</a>  do deep cleanings.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7699.557s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7699.997s">Is</a>  there a motion to accept the bubble RFP guidelines to submit to procurement? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7707.732s">As</a>  amended by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7708.512s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7709.994s">Please</a>  call the roll, Mr. Skerry. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7711.215s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7711.575s">Cunha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7712.056s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7712.236s">Ms.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7713.717s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7719.467s">Yes,</a>  seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, that motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7723.988s">The</a>  second item is to recommend the facility's rental agreement proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7729.709s">If</a>  I could, from the floor, that proposal also includes the fee schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7734.91s">And</a>  I've received a few calls over the past couple of days, actually, of people that are internal, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7743.833s">that</a>  are very concerned about the increase in the fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7746.996s">So</a>  I'd ask that the agreement go to legal and be processed, but that the fee schedule be, have a public hearing, public meeting, so that the public can come forth and tell us their concerns for our own Medford youth programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7760.192s">Is</a>  there a motion on the second? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7763.013s">Seconded</a>  by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7763.654s">Vander</a>  Kloof. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7764.374s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7765.534s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7766.055s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7766.995s">That</a>  document will be sent to legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7769.136s">We</a>  will hold the fee schedule in obedience until we have a meeting with the youth organizations throughout the community so that we get a fee schedule that they can actually afford to participate in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7778.88s">The</a>  last thing we want to do is isolate this field, that we do not have our programs involved.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7783.769s">name</a>  and address, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7784.91s">Name</a>  is Alicia Rourke, 47 Hutchins Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7787.852s">Um,</a>  in reviewing the document, um, I found the categories a bit interesting and that they weren't necessarily in line with how other, um, departments within the city function. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7799.761s">For</a>  instance, our parks commission, they do have for, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7805.67s">divisions</a>  that's based on the rate schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7809.172s">However,</a>  they're quite different than what has been submitted in this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7814.735s">For</a>  the Park Commission, they allow for select teams that are comprised of 75% of Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7824.22s">These</a>  select teams are often for profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7827.782s">They</a>  would fall under the higher rated for profit rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7832.872s">the</a>  way that this document has been created, a non-profit would pay a much lesser rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7839.658s">The</a>  NFL is a non-profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7842.12s">So</a>  the NFL could come and ask to use Edgley Field at a much lower rate than what, say, a kids' club soccer team would pay. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7855.33s">I</a>  think that there really needs to be a much better understanding of <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7861.115s">athletics</a>  and the way that they work in the community, when you're looking at this and the fee schedule and how it's structured. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7869.24s">Point</a>  taken.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7870.781s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7871.801s">Mayor</a>  Burke, I just wanted to note a change that we commented on at that committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7879.306s">On</a>  the facilities rental agreement, first page, page one of 11, item number two, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7888.543s">The</a>  completed application formed together with all necessary documentation, including certificate of insurance, if required, and a security deposit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7897.81s">I</a>  thought we had changed that to non-refundable security deposit for certain situations.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7904.675s">But</a>  that's what a security deposit was.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7906.296s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7906.656s">It</a>  doesn't say that, and we were adding that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7909.138s">At</a>  that meeting, I had it highlighted from that meeting, as well as- Where are we?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7916.143s">Which</a>  bullet is it?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7917.364s">It's</a>  number two.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7920.762s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7921.082s">What</a>  page are we talking about?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7922.624s">It's</a>  right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7924.285s">Page</a>  1, item 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7925.666s">Page</a>  1, item 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7934.734s">That's</a>  not clear, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7935.775s">Because</a>  if someone puts up a security deposit and the facility is left as it was when they came, they would be refunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7942.1s">So</a>  it can't be. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7943.301s">No,</a>  it's supposed to be clarified.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7945.303s">Non-refundable</a>  for cancellation purposes.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7949.819s">So</a>  what is the non-refundable security deposit?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7952.62s">It</a>  cancels within 48 hours.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7954.42s">It</a>  cancels within 48 hours.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7957.841s">Unless</a>  they're in 48 hours.</p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7959.642s">Is</a>  that what you agreed to?</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7964.263s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7967.064s">Cuno.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7971.106s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7971.786s">Sorry</a>  about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7973.326s">It</a>  was a question on the 48 hours only because if it's certain, let's say it's a soccer group. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7979.317s">and</a>  because of weather, they don't know that they're going to be cancelling within 48 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7983.963s">So</a>  that was what we were discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7986.866s">We</a>  did discuss that there would be a non-refund, but I'm not sure about the 48 hours.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=7995.079s">I</a>  was thinking about things like a birthday party is a good example. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8000.002s">If</a>  all of a sudden it's canceled in the last 48 hours before, we can't go out and rent it again, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8007.467s">And</a>  any other place where a parent would be going to have that kind of function would have a <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8015.012s">have</a>  some kind of cancellation policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8020.157s">I</a>  wasn't thinking about a field and it rains. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8023.541s">I</a>  mean, that seems like a different sort of contingency. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8027.024s">So,</a>  again, how we define this in here, we might need to take a look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8033.27s">But</a>  if we have a theater group <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8035.386s">you</a>  know, who's renting the Caron Theater, and all of a sudden they decide not to hold the performance, should we bear the entire cost of their cancellation, of their last minute cancellation? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8047.069s">I</a>  think any place where you go would expect some remuneration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8052.851s">Not</a>  necessarily great, but some.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8058.653s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8058.853s">Cugno,</a>  chairperson. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8062.282s">could</a>  have sworn that we had written it down, that we had come to the conclusion, and we were going to bring it forward to this meeting, of how we were going to present it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8069.908s">Because</a>  there were different scenarios for different situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8073.431s">And</a>  I think at that point, we were going to bring it here to have it clarified, as far as the time was.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8079.976s">We</a>  need the proper language in order to vote for it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8084.667s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8086.048s">Van</a>  der Kloot. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8086.649s">From</a>  my reading of it is if we do a correction on number 2 on page 1 of 11 and say a non-refundable security deposit may be required upon acceptance of rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8099.089s">That,</a>  right now, puts it in this document, and then if we need to be more specific in terms of which of the, if we want to spell out which of the, when we might require a... So it gets canceled within 48 hours of event?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8118.322s">What's</a>  the objective?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8122.366s">to</a>  prevent people from saying they were going to rent a place and then willy-nilly just turning around and not showing up.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8129.892s">Would</a>  date, how many hours beforehand can they cancel? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8133.555s">Is</a>  there a cancellation policy?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8135.957s">Well,</a>  when we did it, we had done 48 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8138.939s">I</a>  don't necessarily know if that's enough, but that's. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8144.684s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8145.905s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8146.865s">We</a>  had also commented on 72 hours at that meeting at that time.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8153.342s">Do</a>  you remember that? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8153.882s">No,</a>  just the one item. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8155.043s">Let's</a>  wrap it up.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8156.463s">Yeah,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8157.284s">Oh,</a>  and then I wasn't finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8159.105s">There</a>  is another section on page five. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8162.666s">You</a>  know me, Roy. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8163.727s">I</a>  look for every detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8165.408s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8165.748s">Was</a>  it discussed in the subcommittee?</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8167.589s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8168.169s">In</a>  the Homel Stadium, it was Homel Stadium usage is controlled by Homel Commission, not rentals. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8178.814s">So</a>  the usage is <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8181.482s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8182.783s">Didn't</a>  we change it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8183.444s">Or</a>  was it usage and we changed it to rentals?</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8187.308s">Is</a>  it, you know, is it different? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8188.709s">I</a>  mean, basically, we're losing... Ms.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8194.935s">Cuno,</a>  chairperson of the subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8196.957s">On</a>  the Hormel Stadium rentals are controlled by Hormel Commission because the rentals themselves, as far as we were told, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8203.663s">The</a>  rentals themselves are through the commission, but as far as the usage, I believe that our athletic director also has purview on the times if we have our teams that are going to be playing, and he's here, so he could clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8221.171s">Mr.</a>  Maloney.</p>

    <p>[Robert Maloney]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8226.373s">Good</a>  evening, Robert Maloney, Sheridan Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8228.934s">The</a>  Hormel Commission is in charge of Hormel Stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8232.612s">You</a>  have to go through the commission, they meet once a month across the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8236.393s">I</a>  schedule the field, I invoice the field, I pay the bills at the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8243.536s">I</a>  meet with Jack Buckley and his commission once a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8247.297s">I</a>  schedule that like I schedule Edgeley Field. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8250.878s">I</a>  want to thank you on a couple things tonight you've already done. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8253.179s">I</a>  have a couple groups here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8257.174s">The</a>  fee structure, I think we really need another meeting, maybe another subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8261.175s">It's</a>  important. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8262.996s">I</a>  apologize for not being at your committee the whole meeting, or subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8267.797s">I</a>  was away. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8269.177s">But</a>  we cannot price these youth groups out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8273.338s">If</a>  you decide to price these youth groups out, you're going to commit political suicide. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8279.3s">I</a>  think there was a recommendation, as you leave field, to go up to 145 for the youth groups, just for your edification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8288.076s">Method</a>  Youth Soccer, which is a fantastic group. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8292.359s">I</a>  know Anne Marie's been a part of it for 100 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8296.062s">They</a>  pay $75 an hour for that field in Hormel Stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8300.665s">If</a>  you go up to 145 on those kids, you're going to have serious issues.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8308.671s">But</a>  I want to thank you for moving that forward.</p>

    <p>[Robert Maloney]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8311.153s">But</a>  as far as Hormel, I schedule Hormel and I schedule Edgeley.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8315.376s">And</a>  the purpose of the fields beyond socially edgily for high school sports is for the youth in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8320.679s">So</a>  that's, I mean, that is the pecking order. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8322.579s">So</a>  we appreciate that and we're not going to price them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8325.121s">They're</a>  built for that purpose.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8326.922s">Points</a>  of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8328.242s">We</a>  weren't, we didn't have that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8330.763s">We</a>  were told that it was $145. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8333.245s">So</a>  when we were looking at, when we were looking at the rates, we actually decided that we want to make sure that we kept our youth programs as they are paying now, because we didn't want to raise <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8345.052s">So</a>  the $75 is something- They pay $75 an hour for practice.</p>

    <p>[Robert Maloney]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8350.84s">Monday</a>  through Friday night, and they pay $100 for a game on a weekend, which is an hour and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8355.722s">So</a>  they're getting a 50% discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8358.644s">And</a>  I believe they're very happy with it, and they would not be able to take an increase.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8364.586s">That</a>  will totally be reviewed, the price structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8367.548s">OK,</a>  that's what I want to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8369.088s">So</a>  could I motion for a subcommittee meeting?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8372.51s">We</a>  just voted on it, that we pulled out the rate schedule from that approval process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8377.272s">I'm</a>  like, we've got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8380.658s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8380.858s">Van</a>  der Kloot was first. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8382.379s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8382.559s">Van</a>  der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8383.16s">So</a>  I just, since we're having that subcommittee, it would be a fine time to also discuss when we should require a non-refundable security deposit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8392.084s">And</a>  I think it would be, we didn't have Mr. Maloney there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8395.466s">And</a>  I think that would be very helpful to have that discussion.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8399.948s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8400.349s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8401.829s">I</a>  just want to clarify changing the word from rentals to usage because the high school teams don't rent it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8409.183s">And</a>  even though you schedule it, you schedule it through for the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8414.026s">So</a>  you're not doing it as your athletic director. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8416.347s">You're</a>  doing it as whatever other hat you're wearing at that moment, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8421.17s">So</a>  I wanted you still to be able to schedule that for usage with no monies attached. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8428.015s">And</a>  that's why I wanted- For Hormel? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8430.996s">For</a>  Hormel.</p>

    <p>[Robert Maloney]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8432.377s">You</a>  can't discuss Hormel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8433.318s">You</a>  need to go before the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8434.178s">It's</a>  the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8435.546s">You</a>  have no authority over Hormel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8437.127s">Nobody</a>  does.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8437.647s">Well,</a>  we're putting a blurb in about it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Maloney]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8441.228s">I'm</a>  just saying nobody, you have to, anybody who wants to rent Hormel other than going through me.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8446.47s">Or</a>  use it.</p>

    <p>[Robert Maloney]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8447.19s">For</a>  Relay for Life, they come, they go before the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8450.931s">They</a>  sit with Jack Buckley, the commission votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8453.932s">They</a>  tell me, take care of like Relay for Life's down there in a couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8457.613s">I</a>  know everybody's a part of, it's a great cause, but Hormel Commission, they're in charge of it.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8465.61s">We</a>  recognize that completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8467.011s">The</a>  reason for putting in a statement which said Hormel Stadium rentals are controlled by the Hormel Commission contact information is so that people who are looking online would get to that because they're trying to rent Hormel and they would see in our document. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8481.193s">Oh,</a>  so we just really put that as a direction so that you wouldn't be flooded with questions or that somebody would know. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8489.335s">It</a>  was really a courtesy quite honestly.</p>

    <p>[Robert Maloney]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8491.223s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8492.123s">The</a>  other thing you're going to realize is I would think you might want to invite Jack Buckley to that meeting because if you change the fees at Edgeley Field to $185 and Hormel stays at $145, people are going to be knocking down Hormel's doors before they want to rent Edgeley. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8511.668s">We</a>  have a good thing in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8512.829s">We</a>  have three great fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8514.791s">And</a>  the one thing gets tiresome up here is Somerville this, Everett this, Winchester that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8520.793s">You</a>  need to understand that we have three turf fields right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8524.053s">They're</a>  going every night to 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8526.614s">They're</a>  going Saturdays and Sundays, 8 to 4. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8529.735s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8530.035s">The</a>  price is right and the fields are in great shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8534.036s">Winchester's</a>  coming online in a couple weeks with a brand new field. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8538.657s">Somerville</a>  charges the athletic department for practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8543.316s">So</a>  I don't want to hear about Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8545.118s">We</a>  have a great thing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8546.859s">And,</a>  you know, you need to consider if you're going to jack the prices at Edgeley, you may want to have the Hormel Commission there so everybody's on the same page.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8555.827s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8557.628s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8563.333s">I</a>  really appreciate your perspective and your knowledge about what the rates are now and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8570.717s">I</a>  also agree that both fields should be on the same level in understanding so that way one doesn't get overused or another or waitlisted. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8582.329s">I</a>  agree wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8583.29s">So</a>  I agree that Mr. Buckley should probably be at that meeting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8588.195s">My</a>  only concern is keeping the prices low. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8592.088s">I</a>  did see the budget for Edgeley Field, and it hasn't come up on the agenda yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8596.391s">And</a>  we will get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8597.792s">But</a>  last year, we were $95,000 in the red for that field because of the bond and the interest on the bond. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8606.959s">And</a>  I know that that has to come in play somehow with usage. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8611.662s">And</a>  this might not be the time when we get further into our agenda for the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8616.165s">We</a>  will discuss that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8618.629s">I</a>  know that that has been rectified with the payment from the city, so we're not in the red any longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8624.071s">But</a>  we will get there, and we'll discuss all these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8627.351s">But</a>  that's my only concern of keeping the rates too low. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8632.073s">We</a>  want to be able to maintain these without going to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8637.714s">And</a>  we can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8638.995s">As</a>  a school committee, we have to figure out a plan to move forward to make sure we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8643.636s">The</a>  bubble might be the answer to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8647.61s">I</a>  do appreciate what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8649.651s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8651.693s">Motion</a>  to approve file. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8653.514s">Motion</a>  to approve the file, excluding the fee schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8657.957s">As</a>  amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8660.338s">Yes,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8660.798s">Kreatz.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8661.119s">These</a>  are just like some minor updates on page two. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8665.562s">It's</a>  just missing a word, like right here under the bullet one, two, three. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8669.805s">Third</a>  bullet down, renters must, it's just missing the word E, 21. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8674.446s">And</a>  then down below, a little bit further, I thought it was going to be new individuals will be admitted to the school building before or after an adult supervisor who must be at least 21 years of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8688.17s">I</a>  thought it was gonna be 21 years of age, but it says 18 years in one section, but 21 in another. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8703.501s">Yeah,</a>  I think it just needs to be changed on the bullet on the bullet. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8707.325s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8708.986s">Two</a>  of the bullets. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=8710.588s">Second</a>  one from the bottom.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9342.308s">Each</a>  student costs approximately $1,600, which includes airfare, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9347.217s">evening</a>  at the hotel, as well as registration into the conference, and then the advisor of $1,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9353.058s">So</a>  it's approximately $4,800. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9356.059s">We</a>  do plan to do as much fundraising as we can in order to support this.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9480.848s">Congratulations</a>  on receiving that grant and to the whole team that put the grant application in.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9526.871s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9527.391s">One</a>  thing that this grant really specifies is that it's not a one-shot deal for presentations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9534.303s">longer</a>  term. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9535.323s">So</a>  they begin in grade 9 and then move all the way through to grade 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9538.904s">So</a>  it's really an embedded curriculum that goes across all content areas within the high school and the vocational high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9545.686s">So</a>  that would be one component, would be to bring in a guest speaker. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9548.987s">But</a>  that's, yes, one component of the entire grant process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9552.568s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9553.228s">We'll</a>  reach out to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9554.329s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9554.749s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9577.649s">So</a>  the next exciting part is, again, another collaboration between Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School is that, come fall, we are offering an EMR adult ed program in the evening, but also an EMT certification program. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9593.359s">That</a>  is a collaboration with Armstrong Ambulance, as well as Bunker Hill Community College. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9599.134s">Where</a>  the high school and the vocational school comes in is that they are also offering us a four credit dual enrollment course that will be offered during the school day for both high school students and Medford vocational high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9613.277s">So</a>  upon completion of this course, they will have been certified as an emergency medical responder. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9618.878s">This</a>  is a requirement if a graduate goes into the military, becomes a firefighter or any sort of civil service, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9627.1s">as</a>  well as an EMT and paramedic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9628.921s">So</a>  it's a precursor to the EMT and paramedic program that is also offered at Bunker Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9633.985s">So</a>  they will receive, at no cost to them, four credits towards that certification. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9639.348s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9640.869s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9642.09s">Very</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9738.401s">It</a>  will be done by a variety of sources because the individual will receive the construction OSHA 10-hour card, so that will be done by an OSHA trainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9748.125s">They</a>  will also receive CPR and first aid, which will be done by a trained CPR and first aid associate. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9756.004s">and</a>  then a carpentry and construction trainer as well that has to be certified in order to use the equipment, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9763.949s">And</a>  we have posted this position internally because our goal is to hire staff internally as they will be taking care of the property of Medford Public Schools.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9777.274s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9777.474s">Cuno?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9778.874s">I</a>  just want to ask about the CPR course. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9782.175s">Well,</a>  it's part of the course. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9784.156s">Will</a>  the students have options of getting certified?</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9788.357s">They</a>  will. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9789.037s">So</a>  upon completion, they will get their first aid CPR certification as well as their OSHA construction card. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9796.203s">Any</a>  of these types of programs, how they deem it to be successful is by having a credential attached to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9803.789s">So</a>  those are the types of credentials that are needed in the construction and building trades, and therefore they will have received that certification.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9812.115s">And</a>  is there any other fee? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9814.237s">adjacent</a>  to it, like I know the boys, I mean, it's a different thing, but I know my boys just took a CPOC course through our school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9821.984s">But</a>  to get certified and for their certification, they had to pay a fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9825.747s">So</a>  I'm not sure if there's anything.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9826.748s">So</a>  this adult ed program is being paid for by the Commonwealth Corporation because it is a retraining grant in order to retrain under or unemployed individuals within the greater Boston community. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9841.0s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9841.781s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9844.271s">recent</a>  grant applications? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9845.752s">Do</a>  you want to just hit on them?</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9848.133s">Yeah,</a>  basically so that you know that our school is working very hard and diligently looking for alternative funding sources as we continue to expand our career and technical education programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9861.919s">We</a>  do feel it necessary to make sure that we're meeting industry demands, and with that comes equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9867.502s">So</a>  we have collectively and collaboratively, again with the high school, as well as our colleagues, have applied for multiple grant opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9877.566s">The</a>  first being the CTE makeover challenge grant, and Molly Layden, who I think is still behind us, has helped me write this grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9886.369s">It</a>  was a two-phase process, so we're in the second phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9889.57s">We</a>  did make it to the second round of that grant application, and we'll be submitting by the end of this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9895.652s">I</a>  also have to say that Kathy Kreatz, as a member of our advisory board, has reviewed the grant application and provided feedback, so I would like to thank her for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9905.665s">The</a>  second grant application is from the Auto Collision and Repair Education Foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9909.828s">It's</a>  a makeover grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9911.929s">Many</a>  of these grants you have to reapply because you may not get it the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9916.432s">We</a>  didn't get it last year, but we did get feedback, so we're hoping to strengthen our application process, and we will be submitting that grant application in the next two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9927.293s">With</a>  the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and as you know, in vocational education, it's pretty hot in the state of Massachusetts, and making sure that all students are prepared not only for college, but also for their career, even beyond college. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9942.203s">Therefore,</a>  the Department of Education has submitted an RFP for $10,000 of a planning grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9948.847s">That</a>  planning grant is going to be extremely important for us to get this planning grant, because it is a precursor to <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9955.872s">a</a>  much larger grant of $150,000 in equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9960.694s">And</a>  so in order to be able to write that second phase of that grant, you have to have received this $10,000 grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9968.858s">We</a>  sat into a webinar last week, and there are 120 schools that were listening to this webinar, and they are only giving out $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9977.435s">planning</a>  grants of $10,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9979.556s">So</a>  it's extremely competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9981.837s">We're</a>  not sure if we're going to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9983.898s">But</a>  one thing that we are looking for is partnerships. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=9987.38s">And</a>  I'm just going to really quickly list off that the Metro North Regional Employment Board, Bunker Hill Community College, Comcast, Wynn Boston Harbor, State Representative Barber, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10000.366s">Light</a>  Cyber, which is an Internet securities firm. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10004.748s">The</a>  Furniture Trust and Congresswoman Clark have all reached out and given us letters of support for this grant, and there will be additional grant fundings, as you see in your other packet here from the Massachusetts Business Roundtable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10018.755s">is</a>  that Governor Baker, they did pass an act with approximately $75 million in funding that is going to target specifically vocational education, which may also be in the community college level as well and career pathways. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10032.362s">But</a>  the nice part about us being housed in the same complex as the high school is that they are looking at creative ways to increase <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10039.905s">opportunities</a>  in technical education in comprehensive high schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10043.488s">So,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10045.109s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10045.289s">Vandekloot.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10045.95s">So,</a>  Heidi, I know you like a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10048.172s">And</a>  this is a pretty great challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10049.893s">This</a>  is fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10051.174s">Good</a>  luck. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10051.794s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10055.397s">And</a>  the last item is a New York Times article. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10059.741s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10060.421s">Kritz.</a> </p>

    <p>[Kathy Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10061.302s">I</a>  just wanted to say congratulations, Heidi, on qualifying to the next level. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10066.226s">I</a>  know what a big deal it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10067.307s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10068.067s">Congratulations.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10069.729s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10069.969s">Is</a>  there a way that we can publicize that we're looking for, industry level? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10075.873s">I</a>  mean, might there be other businesses you particularly want to attract?</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10084.039s">I</a>  think since this is publicized and all of you being community members, it will be really essential that anyone that's listening that feels as though they have a presence, this particular grant that we are writing, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10097.608s">is</a>  going to focus on all technology-based programs, which includes TV production, media technology, computer programming and web development, marketing, business technology, graphic communications, design and visual, and information technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10113.507s">So</a>  we're looking at really creating this hub. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10115.874s">or</a>  this epicenter or innovation center, and robotics and engineering, where they're all kind of working together towards a common purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10123.278s">So</a>  if anybody out there is listening and definitely has a field of interest, certainly, and we can, I think Allison's still here. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10131.543s">Nope,</a>  she left. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10132.284s">So</a>  Allison Goldsberry can also post it on our website, and we can have Lisa post it in the blog as well.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10139.468s">Did</a>  you consider Tufts University?</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10141.71s">We</a>  do actually have Tufts University, but we're waiting for their letter, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10145.591s">I</a>  didn't want to put them until, but thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10152.113s">And</a>  lastly, the New York Times article. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10155.634s">The</a>  last exciting part is that I think you all know Isaac Cardoso, who is a state officer with Massachusetts SkillsUSA. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10163.496s">He</a>  will be graduating in just a couple of weeks, but he is also going to the national conference that is being paid for by SkillsUSA. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10171.787s">He</a>  was reached out to us by the New York Times because they're doing a story on vocational education across the nation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10180.412s">And</a>  they were looking for somebody that is going directly into the trades in some way through an apprenticeship program upon high school completion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10190.138s">We</a>  were approached by the state director of Massachusetts SkillsUSA. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10194.72s">So</a>  he was selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10197.613s">one</a>  person in the entire nation to be represented as being a successful model for vocational education. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10205.017s">We</a>  are very fortunate to have him also receive the IBEW Local 103 Scholarship, and so he will be entering IBEW in the summer.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10219.022s">So</a>  one of my friends said to me, did you see the Times? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10222.784s">Did</a>  you know that the Medford Vocational School is featured in it? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10226.126s">Which</a>  I didn't, and I still haven't seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10228.427s">Do</a>  you have a copy of the article? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10230.328s">Yes,</a>  you have it actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10232.149s">I</a>  could not find it.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10233.91s">They</a>  just circulated them earlier.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10235.851s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10237.112s">Uh-huh.</a> </p>

    <p>[Heidi Riccio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10237.832s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10238.633s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10239.233s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10239.533s">It</a>  was also posted in our blog as well over the weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10243.555s">So</a>  it's a pretty cool article. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10246.277s">And</a>  the picture, the New York Times actually came to the electrical shop last week and took the picture in our electrical shop. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10252.96s">So</a>  we're pretty excited about that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10254.861s">Wonderful.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10255.782s">That's</a>  fabulous.</p>

    <p>[Erin DiBenedetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10257.182s">Mr.</a>  Benedetto? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10258.683s">I</a>  just want to commend Isaac for his work through our school system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10263.686s">I</a>  mean, he's represented Method well for a lot of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10266.642s">I</a>  remember when he first started running for this seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10271.786s">And</a>  it's just been a pleasure to watch him grow up and represent us in such a great way. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10277.79s">And</a>  the mentoring that you and your staff have given to our vocational students is very impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10286.216s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10288.413s">Nice</a>  presentation, Heidi. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10289.413s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10290.073s">Is</a>  a motion to receive in place on file? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10292.454s">Motion</a>  to receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10294.314s">On</a>  the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10294.815s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10296.515s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10297.155s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10298.756s">Pre-budget</a>  report guidance.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10300.316s">So</a>  we're going to call upon our guidance director, Amelia Jensen, to tell us about the guidance department.</p>

    <p>[7DUlBp6f_Us_SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10308.65s">Hi,</a>  good evening Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and members of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10313.571s">Tonight</a>  I'm here to give you the pre-budget report for guidance, and I too will be very quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10319.113s">I'll</a>  give you an overview of the guidance department to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10322.013s">So</a>  the guidance department currently consists of 10 Councilors, five Councilors at the high school, one at the vocational school, and two at each of the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10331.276s">The</a>  mission of the guidance department is to ensure that all students thrive in the three areas of college and career readiness, <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10337.617s">academic</a>  development, and social and emotional wellness. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10341.16s">And</a>  those are the areas we base our curriculum, our programs, and our opportunities on. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10346.765s">To</a>  deliver this counseling curriculum, the middle school Councilors teach classes to students in all grades, and the high school Councilors meet with students in a variety of ways, including the guidance seminars through the advisory program, as well as individual meetings and classroom pull-outs and collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10363.953s">So</a>  our use of funding for the school year 2015-2016 was consistent with what was reported. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10370.995s">And</a>  thanks to that funding, we've had some major accomplishments this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10376.016s">In</a>  the report, you'll see a list of many accomplishments, but I'm going to highlight three tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10382.719s">First,</a>  this year we had our first annual C3 Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10385.962s">C3</a>  Day was a day that was dedicated to college, career, and community service for the entire school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10393.789s">What</a>  we did is through the funding that you so graciously gave us last year, all of our juniors were able to take the PSAT free of charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10401.116s">which</a>  really got them thinking about college, it helped prepare them for the SAT, and it really created a strong college-going culture. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10408.057s">During</a>  that day, all seniors had the opportunity to participate in off-campus events regarding college, career, or community and civic experiences. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10418.179s">Many</a>  students used this day to take college visits. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10422.38s">Tufts</a>  University hosted a career panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10425.66s">Students</a>  job shadowed did community service. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10428.881s">Tufts</a>  also hosted an essay writing workshop on our school campus and there were many more opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10434.71s">So</a>  it was an extremely successful event and we are looking forward to doing it again next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10439.848s">The</a>  second major accomplishment was that we were able to advance our experiential learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10444.87s">So</a>  last year we asked for an additional school Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10448.571s">We</a>  used that school Councilor as our new school and community partnerships Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10453.493s">This</a>  position has made a huge difference for students because this person in this position has brought many opportunities to Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10464.85s">One</a>  specific thing is that we were able to offer a Bunker Hill dual enrollment class on campus after school to junior and senior students, which was sociology free of charge for up to 30 students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10476.898s">We're</a>  looking at expanding that next year and teaching more courses at school so students can get college and high school credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10486.344s">This</a>  position was also able to connect over 300 students with community service opportunities, internships, and job placements by partnering with the community, with Tufts University, with the Medford Chamber of Commerce, with different businesses and organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10504.005s">Our</a>  third major accomplishment this year that I'm going to note tonight is that we were able to expand our social and emotional learning in the middle schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10512.669s">So</a>  last year, the middle school Councilors at the McGlynn Middle School were able to teach students all three grades in guidance classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10522.554s">And</a>  this year, thanks to Mr. DeLeva and working with us in the scheduling, now the Andrews Middle School Councilors also teach sixth, seventh, and eighth grade guidance classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10533.12s">So</a>  this is really pushing forward our freshmen, I'm sorry, this is really pushing forward our students so when they become freshmen at the high school they're all in the same place socially and emotionally with our Michigan model curriculum. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10548.1s">So</a>  for next year, our request for the school year 2016-2017, we're really looking at keeping level funding with our textbook and our PSAT accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10560.768s">And</a>  we're hoping to increase our office supplies by $300 to assist with materials needed for our advisory seminars. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10567.732s">and</a>  increase our contractual services by $500, which would cover professional development related to two areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10576.235s">One</a>  would be training the Councilors in vocational education to further the integration process of the high school and the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10583.398s">And</a>  the other area would be with the ELL population, counseling them in regards to the transition after high school and college. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10592.002s">There's</a>  very limited resources out there, so they need some additional training. <a href="https://youtu.be/2pAQFYhyG5g&t=10597.649s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
