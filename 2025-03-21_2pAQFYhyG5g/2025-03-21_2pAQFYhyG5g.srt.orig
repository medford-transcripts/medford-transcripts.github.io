[SPEAKER_23]: Madam Mayor and members of the committee and ladies and gentlemen,

11
00:00:52,046 --> 00:01:06,983
[SPEAKER_23]: Tonight we're distinctly privileged and honored to have with us the Medford Middle School String Ensemble, which was founded in 2009 by Medford teacher Sophia Chang to encourage the development of musical excellence.

12
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:12,589
[SPEAKER_23]: Miss Chang is serving her 13th year as orchestra director at McGlynn Middle School.

13
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:21,178
[SPEAKER_23]: Since 2011, the ensemble has received six consecutive gold medals at the Concert Festival Conference.

14
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:27,141
[SPEAKER_23]: The string ensemble performed at Boston Symphony Hall and Mechanics Hall in Worcester.

15
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:39,328
[SPEAKER_23]: Many of her former students continue to pursue musicianship at the Tufts Youth Philharmonic, the NEC Youth Orchestra, the Boston Philharmonic Youth Orchestra, and among others.

16
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:45,237
[SPEAKER_23]: Mrs. Chang is committed to foster broader appreciation for classical music to young people.

17
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:56,269
[SPEAKER_23]: Tonight, we are privileged to hear them perform at least two selections, Cakewalk from Serenade for String Orchestra by Norman Leiden, and Lullaby by William Huffeld.

18
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:00,034
[SPEAKER_23]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, let's welcome our middle school orchestra.

19
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:21,313
you.

20
00:04:37,962 --> 00:04:38,042
Yeah.

21
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:40,089
[SPEAKER_18]: Bravo, what a beautiful way to start our meeting off this evening.

22
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:41,649
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you all so very much.

23
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,410
[SPEAKER_18]: That was absolutely glorious.

24
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:43,891
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

25
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:45,351
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

26
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:45,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Van de Kloot.

27
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:52,981
[SPEAKER_13]: So tonight, I was so excited because I knew that when I came to the meeting that Ms.

28
00:11:53,001 --> 00:11:54,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Chang and the students would be here.

29
00:11:55,081 --> 00:12:07,087
[SPEAKER_13]: And you know, we've watched each year asking for them to come and perform at our school committee meeting because there's no better reminder for us of what excellence we have in the Medford Public Schools.

30
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:25,460
[SPEAKER_13]: I am so, so proud of these students, the work, the determination, looking at their faces, looking at the concentration.

31
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:34,066
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, one of the other privileges that I've had is to watch them go on, go on to the high school, talk to them.

32
00:12:34,706 --> 00:12:37,268
[SPEAKER_13]: They're siblings that I've seen.

33
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:41,911
[SPEAKER_13]: One family member moves on up to the high school, but another family member comes in.

34
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:44,713
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank the parents for making sure

35
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:47,554
[SPEAKER_13]: that their students get to all of these performances.

36
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:50,656
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Ms.

37
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:56,678
[SPEAKER_13]: Cheng for her amazing dedication to these students and to the music program.

38
00:12:57,059 --> 00:13:00,180
[SPEAKER_13]: And students, I want to commend you on your excellent performance.

39
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,881
[SPEAKER_13]: It is wonderful to achieve at this level.

40
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:03,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

41
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:13,579
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

42
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,961
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to reiterate what Ms.

43
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:21,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Vander Kloot said, but we are so impressed and so proud of who our students are.

44
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:25,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I also have to shout out to the whole music department.

45
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:34,032
[SPEAKER_14]: I had the privilege last week to go to the high school and the middle school band concerts, the orchestra concert.

46
00:13:34,972 --> 00:13:38,634
[SPEAKER_14]: And each and every time, it just gets better and better and better.

47
00:13:39,254 --> 00:13:46,338
[SPEAKER_14]: And for us, I can't be more proud of who you are and who you represent, because we are not representing you.

48
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:48,359
[SPEAKER_14]: You are representing us.

49
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:50,620
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can't be prouder than that.

50
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:57,623
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto?

51
00:13:59,184 --> 00:14:01,125
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, I just want to take a moment

52
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:06,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank the students for filling this room with beauty and grace and art.

53
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,537
[SPEAKER_16]: This is art in our community right here.

54
00:14:09,697 --> 00:14:11,438
[SPEAKER_16]: We're creating artists.

55
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:12,278
[SPEAKER_16]: And Ms.

56
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:13,559
[SPEAKER_16]: Chang is not easy.

57
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,739
[SPEAKER_16]: I know my daughter had her many years ago.

58
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,741
[SPEAKER_16]: And you have to hold the bowl in a special way.

59
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:21,641
[SPEAKER_16]: And she holds them all accountable.

60
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:23,702
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's why you are so good.

61
00:14:24,242 --> 00:14:25,943
[SPEAKER_16]: It's because of the teaching you have.

62
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:29,104
[SPEAKER_16]: And my daughter still plays today.

63
00:14:29,184 --> 00:14:30,084
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mrs. Chang.

64
00:14:30,597 --> 00:14:37,803
[SPEAKER_16]: as well as Mr. Zigny and all the other people in the music department and the fine arts department.

65
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:48,691
[SPEAKER_16]: We as a committee have really committed ourselves to arts in our schools, and that has brought more art to our community, and I hope that we can continue this work together.

66
00:14:49,392 --> 00:14:53,235
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your time in bringing such beauty and peace into my evening.

67
00:15:01,242 --> 00:15:05,584
[SPEAKER_18]: And now if I could all invite you up to the front so that we can present some awards to you all.

68
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:52,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for coming tonight.

69
00:15:54,417 --> 00:16:03,759
[SPEAKER_02]: To listen to the children play, I am just, my appreciation is beyond words.

70
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,719
[SPEAKER_02]: It is my great pleasure to teach in Medford.

71
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:23,302
[SPEAKER_02]: The ensemble was formed seven years ago to encourage artistic excellence, and the award is the result of a collective effort from all the students,

72
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:25,003
[SPEAKER_02]: and their parents.

73
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:30,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of my former students also come to coach the youngsters.

74
00:16:30,925 --> 00:16:32,746
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate their help.

75
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:48,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Our gratitude goes to the school committee and all the administrators, the faculties, friends, and families for their unwavering support.

157
00:32:47,027 --> 00:33:03,114
[SPEAKER_10]: It did exist in Medford about 17 years ago, but my co-founder, Paulette Vanderkloot, and I resuscitated it, and we launched it in about December of 2015, and we got 501c3 status pretty quickly.

158
00:33:03,455 --> 00:33:05,415
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we did a lot of fundraising.

159
00:33:05,495 --> 00:33:09,557
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a wonderful event at Wright's Pond in September of that same year.

160
00:33:11,385 --> 00:33:21,647
[SPEAKER_10]: We basically were able to give out grants to faculty as early as December 15, 2015, with a window of about a month, January 15, 2016.

161
00:33:23,608 --> 00:33:28,569
[SPEAKER_10]: And we awarded close to $7,000 worth of grants.

162
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:35,471
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a reprint of a transcript article that outlines in detail what those grants were.

163
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:39,512
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm hoping if this might be something that I might submit, perhaps.

164
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:45,798
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just a direct quote from the paper.

165
00:33:46,379 --> 00:33:55,748
[SPEAKER_10]: But as I mentioned before, David Sears, also Medford resident and parent, is the head of our Grants to Faculty Committee.

166
00:33:56,448 --> 00:34:00,132
[SPEAKER_10]: And he has a little presentation that I think he's going to give.

167
00:34:00,352 --> 00:34:01,093
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

168
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:03,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Anne.

169
00:34:03,134 --> 00:34:03,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

170
00:34:04,408 --> 00:34:06,129
[SPEAKER_00]: As Anne said, my name is David Sayers.

171
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:15,913
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a resident of Medford with my family for the past 14 years, and I am the chairperson of the Grants to Faculty Committee of the Medford Educational Fund, or MEF.

172
00:34:15,933 --> 00:34:24,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, I'd just like to give you a brief introduction of our goals and a short summary of the grants that we've awarded to date and plans for the near future.

173
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:29,039
[SPEAKER_00]: As Anne mentioned, we launched officially in January 2015.

174
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:44,888
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to the support and guidance of the City of Medford officials and the generous support of local individuals and businesses, we were able to hold our first grants less than five months after becoming a 501c3 organization.

175
00:34:45,608 --> 00:34:49,349
[SPEAKER_00]: This past December, the MEF kicked off its first round of grant solicitations.

176
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:55,671
[SPEAKER_00]: We received 17 applications and we're pleased to be able to fund 11 of them, totaling almost $7,500.

177
00:34:55,851 --> 00:35:00,132
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to highlight a few of those awards for you this evening.

178
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:06,536
[SPEAKER_00]: At the elementary school level, we were able to bring the hands-on history program to three of our elementary schools.

179
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:18,058
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally proposed by fifth grade McGlynn teacher Anthony Petrellis, Colette Vander Kloot, on behalf of the MEF, worked to expand this exciting opportunity to the Roberts and Columbus schools as well.

180
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:26,500
[SPEAKER_00]: This program brought presenters into the schools with over $100,000 worth of original 18th century artifacts and reenactments

181
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:32,549
[SPEAKER_00]: of the soldiers during the Revolutionary War to help bring what the students are learning in the classroom to real life.

182
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:41,571
[SPEAKER_00]: The MEF was also able to fund in part a grant to spearhead an innovation to bring hydroponics to the elementary school level.

183
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:49,333
[SPEAKER_00]: Started by McGlynn principal Diane Guarino and fourth grade teacher Donna Lasky, fourth grade students are learning about hydroponics.

184
00:35:49,754 --> 00:35:54,795
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the students are having fun, they are also realizing how what they learn in science, math, and social studies

185
00:35:55,214 --> 00:35:56,795
[SPEAKER_00]: applies to real-world problems.

186
00:35:57,536 --> 00:36:14,648
[SPEAKER_00]: At the middle school level, we were happy to fund a garden project by social studies teacher Kathleen O'Donoghue, who is teaching her 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students about how to build a sustainable food source in an urban setting and also learn about providing healthy food for themselves and their families.

187
00:36:15,528 --> 00:36:22,333
[SPEAKER_00]: At the high school level, we are helping to expand the existing successful aquaponics fish tank to include a hydroponics system.

188
00:36:22,717 --> 00:36:25,758
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the plants will clean the water and the fish will fertilize the plants.

189
00:36:26,398 --> 00:36:44,065
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we are funding programs that target at-risk students through the Empower Student Club at the high school and teach real-world skills through Nicholas Kane's excellent docent teaching training program and teaching publishing skills through turning the online student mantra magazine into a print version.

190
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:48,207
[SPEAKER_00]: In total, we were able to fund three grants at the elementary school level,

191
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:52,031
[SPEAKER_00]: one at the middle school level, and seven at the high school and vocational school.

192
00:36:52,691 --> 00:37:00,278
[SPEAKER_00]: We have recently announced our next round of funding for the fall 2016 school year, and have already started receiving proposals.

193
00:37:00,798 --> 00:37:05,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Going forward, we plan to have two main funding cycles a year, due October 15 and May 1.

194
00:37:06,823 --> 00:37:07,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your time and attention.

195
00:37:08,484 --> 00:37:09,105
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

196
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:16,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

197
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:18,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Vanden Heuvel.

198
00:37:18,187 --> 00:37:23,050
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to thank Anne and David for being here today, because I am part of it.

199
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,632
[SPEAKER_13]: I know how hard they've worked to make this successful.

200
00:37:26,973 --> 00:37:29,454
[SPEAKER_13]: I think many of us have heard about some of the projects.

201
00:37:29,554 --> 00:37:39,621
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I read about some of them in the newspaper and whatever, and I knew that they were also projects that the Medford Educational Fund had funded.

202
00:37:39,741 --> 00:37:44,685
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you to them for being here, and we appreciate the support of the school committee.

203
00:37:46,140 --> 00:38:02,268
[SPEAKER_13]: I should also, I'd like to quickly add that it's been incredibly helpful to, Pat Vili has guided us on some of the financial things that we needed help with, and we really, really appreciate Pat's help and direction.

204
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:16,637
[SPEAKER_14]: I also want to say thank you to Ian and David and everyone else who was involved in this, and to my colleague Paula Van de Kloot.

205
00:38:16,937 --> 00:38:31,526
[SPEAKER_14]: What I'm really happy about is that it was not only a plan of an organization to come to us and say what your plan was going to be, but you actually put your money where your mouth was and came up with money and was able to distribute it with the school system.

206
00:38:31,986 --> 00:38:36,689
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thank you for that, and I thank you for making that reality, not just talk.

207
00:38:37,237 --> 00:38:44,102
[SPEAKER_14]: It really shows when people do roll up their sleeves and work together, what things could really, can and will be accomplished.

208
00:38:44,483 --> 00:38:45,423
[SPEAKER_14]: So I thank you for that.

209
00:38:45,443 --> 00:38:46,804
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

210
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:48,245
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

211
00:38:48,265 --> 00:38:48,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Kratz.

212
00:38:49,486 --> 00:38:53,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I also just want to thank David and Ian, and I wanted to share an experience.

213
00:38:53,609 --> 00:38:54,270
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Ms.

214
00:38:54,310 --> 00:39:02,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Lasky's class and I got to see the, by hydroponics, yep, the hydroponics, and I got to taste the lettuce.

215
00:39:02,476 --> 00:39:04,938
[SPEAKER_03]: They cut it and the students brought in the dressing and

216
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:06,569
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great experience.

217
00:39:06,629 --> 00:39:09,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've also seen the aquaponics at the high school, Mr. Russo's class.

218
00:39:10,073 --> 00:39:13,476
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a wonderful experience for the kids.

219
00:39:13,556 --> 00:39:14,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just so fun.

220
00:39:14,917 --> 00:39:15,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And the kids were so happy.

221
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,179
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you so much.

222
00:39:18,501 --> 00:39:18,861
[SPEAKER_18]: Wonderful.

223
00:39:19,161 --> 00:39:21,944
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much for all your hard work on behalf of the students of Medford.

224
00:39:22,605 --> 00:39:22,825
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

225
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:34,969
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to receive in place on file the report by Miss Van de Kloeth, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

226
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:35,730
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

227
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:36,991
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

228
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:37,852
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

229
00:39:38,473 --> 00:39:43,359
[SPEAKER_18]: Also while we're into suspension from community participation, Anne-Sherla Monzel-Moore, follow-up.

230
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:44,099
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

231
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:44,300
[SPEAKER_18]: Moore.

232
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:52,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening and thank you school committee, um, Mr. Superintendent and Madam Mayor for allowing me to speak.

233
00:39:53,595 --> 00:40:02,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I spoke before you on April 11th and I asked the committee to have a transparent succession plan for the position of superintendent in place by June of this year.

234
00:40:04,143 --> 00:40:11,408
[SPEAKER_06]: On May 3rd, I attended the city council meeting and was very surprised to learn that in the superintendent's contract,

235
00:40:11,987 --> 00:40:17,749
[SPEAKER_06]: It states that the school committee shall advise the superintendent of its intent to extend his contract by June 30, 2016.

236
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:25,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I was disappointed to hear this from a city counselor given the fact four committee members were part of the negotiations for the current contract.

237
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:30,695
[SPEAKER_06]: That information could have been relayed to me when I spoke on April 11th.

238
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:35,457
[SPEAKER_06]: With that being said, I would assume the committee will have a plan in place by the given date.

239
00:40:35,777 --> 00:40:38,858
[SPEAKER_06]: This is probably the most important role that you as a school committee member

240
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,391
[SPEAKER_06]: will play in your tenure.

241
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:42,192
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your legacy as elected officials.

242
00:40:42,893 --> 00:40:44,854
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get this right or you can get this very wrong.

243
00:40:46,015 --> 00:40:51,179
[SPEAKER_06]: I followed up with each of you individually via email, and again, did not receive a response from the majority of you.

244
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:53,200
[SPEAKER_06]: From those that did respond, thank you.

245
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:59,485
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm asking from you is to devise a plan in the event Medford needs to hire a new superintendent.

246
00:40:59,545 --> 00:41:02,727
[SPEAKER_06]: You've not been faced with such a task in over 20 years.

247
00:41:03,748 --> 00:41:07,751
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the need did arise any time soon, you would have no guidelines set forth.

248
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:13,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Such a situation would surely result in panic and a haphazard process of finding a replacement.

249
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:17,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultimately, this is not about Mr. Belson's contract.

250
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:21,102
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the fact that it is the catalyst for such a discussion cannot be ignored.

251
00:41:21,923 --> 00:41:25,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm speaking to you as a citizen you have been elected to represent.

252
00:41:25,987 --> 00:41:28,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also speaking to you on behalf of the 250 other residents

253
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:32,450
[SPEAKER_06]: that have signed both an online and paper petition.

254
00:41:32,971 --> 00:41:42,376
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm frustrated a petition had to be started asking you to do your due diligence and ensure that proper measures are being taken regarding filling one of the most important positions in our school system.

255
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:47,539
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not just a small group of people with a sudden sense of urgency that are concerned about this.

256
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:51,961
[SPEAKER_06]: These are your constituents, and this is a plan that should always have been in place.

257
00:41:52,962 --> 00:41:58,305
[SPEAKER_06]: With all of that being said, I will reiterate the questions I have regarding the process for renewal.

258
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:01,589
[SPEAKER_06]: and the subsequent questions should a contract not be renewed.

259
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Please feel free to take notes and answer when I'm done speaking.

260
00:42:05,393 --> 00:42:11,839
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said before, this plan is not just about this contract, but since this contract is the one being renewed, it needs to be addressed.

261
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:17,364
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand Mr. Belson is currently working on a self-evaluation as stated in his contract.

262
00:42:18,004 --> 00:42:21,127
[SPEAKER_06]: I further understand you will then begin your process of evaluation.

263
00:42:21,696 --> 00:42:30,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Given you are obligated to work on this as a committee, at what point do you discuss your evaluations if the superintendent is always present at every meeting and every executive session?

264
00:42:31,122 --> 00:42:34,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this process made public and is there an opportunity for public input?

265
00:42:35,665 --> 00:42:43,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Is Mr. Belson's contract automatically extended on June 30th if your evaluations determine he is performing in a satisfactory manner?

266
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:47,713
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point, I feel your lack of a succession plan will truly come into play.

267
00:42:48,353 --> 00:42:51,235
[SPEAKER_06]: If Mr. Belson announces at a later date that he plans on retiring,

268
00:42:51,689 --> 00:42:52,469
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your plan?

269
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:55,210
[SPEAKER_06]: A plan should answer the following questions.

270
00:42:55,930 --> 00:43:01,552
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the guidelines put forth with respect to renewing the superintendent's contract and finding a replacement?

271
00:43:02,292 --> 00:43:19,738
[SPEAKER_06]: These guidelines should include, but not be limited to, evaluation of the current superintendent as set forth by the terms in his contract, allowing the school committee to do their own evaluation and discuss said evaluations without the superintendent present, gathering input from the community regarding their evaluations,

272
00:43:20,478 --> 00:43:26,522
[SPEAKER_06]: If the contract is renewed, it should be clearly documented how recent and longstanding issues within the school system will be addressed.

273
00:43:27,923 --> 00:43:33,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly stated and documented requirements for a successor should be put forth.

274
00:43:34,268 --> 00:43:41,673
[SPEAKER_06]: The guidelines should coherently document what the initiatives and direction of Medford Public Schools are and how they will be sustained by a successor.

275
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:49,539
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to evaluate the potential for an internal replacement and the eligibility requirements for such a vertical career move.

276
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:59,718
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to establish a timeline for searching for and transitioning in a replacement, allowing time for a replacement to work alongside the current superintendent if possible.

277
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:06,220
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, you need to determine how to record and maintain the knowledge that Mr. Belson does currently possess.

278
00:44:06,961 --> 00:44:11,422
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a vast amount of knowledge and it's a vast network that he has created.

279
00:44:12,202 --> 00:44:14,123
[SPEAKER_06]: And you need to know how to relay that to a successor.

280
00:44:15,147 --> 00:44:19,431
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm proposing should be a matter of routine governing within the realm of the school committee.

281
00:44:20,132 --> 00:44:27,740
[SPEAKER_06]: As stated by one resident who signed the petition, succession planning is critical for a smooth search and leadership transition.

282
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:30,143
[SPEAKER_06]: We need the school committee to be proactive.

283
00:44:30,823 --> 00:44:37,210
[SPEAKER_06]: As our elected representatives, they should implement a thoughtful, transparent process that prioritizes community input.

284
00:44:38,562 --> 00:44:44,224
[SPEAKER_06]: I urge you to complete this process sooner rather than later and avoid the possibility of panic in our school system.

285
00:44:44,784 --> 00:44:50,525
[SPEAKER_06]: There is indeed a sense of urgency since a proper search and transition should a replacement be needed will likely take a year.

286
00:44:51,225 --> 00:44:55,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Now is the time you should be organizing yourselves and preparing yourself to take action if necessary.

287
00:44:56,327 --> 00:44:56,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

288
00:44:58,468 --> 00:44:58,628
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

289
00:44:58,648 --> 00:44:59,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuneo.

290
00:45:00,028 --> 00:45:00,369
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

291
00:45:01,029 --> 00:45:01,629
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you, Ms.

292
00:45:01,669 --> 00:45:06,310
[SPEAKER_14]: Moore for coming here again and bringing your concerns to us.

293
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:07,871
[SPEAKER_14]: And I respect that.

294
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:13,572
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to address something in the room that maybe no one wants to talk about.

295
00:45:13,632 --> 00:45:19,294
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is the elephant in the room, the rumors, the Facebook posts, the discussions between constituents.

296
00:45:20,111 --> 00:45:21,952
[SPEAKER_14]: and not to mention the City Council.

297
00:45:22,613 --> 00:45:30,658
[SPEAKER_14]: As a member of the School Committee, I truly want to thank you and I want to thank anyone who is truly concerned and has a vested interest in this situation.

298
00:45:31,399 --> 00:45:35,742
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the idea of having people come up and discuss their ideas, for this is the forum.

299
00:45:36,504 --> 00:45:38,085
[SPEAKER_14]: where this discussion should be held.

300
00:45:38,846 --> 00:45:50,635
[SPEAKER_14]: However, I also want to remind everyone as a school committee member, there is a process and a succession of what we as a body need and decide to discuss and determine for the best interest of our district.

301
00:45:51,296 --> 00:45:56,640
[SPEAKER_14]: As a committee member or anyone who needs to compare and evaluate, we need to compare one year to the next.

302
00:45:57,361 --> 00:45:59,462
[SPEAKER_14]: And we are in the process of collecting that data.

303
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:05,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, as far as transparency, let's address what maybe I took for granted

304
00:46:06,672 --> 00:46:07,432
[SPEAKER_14]: That was obvious.

305
00:46:08,473 --> 00:46:10,554
[SPEAKER_14]: I will speak for myself as a school committee member.

306
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:31,886
[SPEAKER_14]: After investing 10 years, completed years, nine years as MASC, as a member, executive board member, and not to mention the president of Massachusetts Association of School Committees, meaning that I represent of all the school committee members in the state, the projects, the money, the time, the networking in our city, across the state and country,

307
00:46:32,462 --> 00:46:47,972
[SPEAKER_14]: We have invested, and I hope and think parents, students, administrators, teachers, and constituents in our district would not believe that we, as your elected officials, would have been given this position and will take the hiring of a new superintendent very lightly.

308
00:46:49,012 --> 00:47:00,860
[SPEAKER_14]: The hiring of superintendent, especially under our circumstances, whatever you agree or disagree, like or dislike the superintendent, the gentleman has been in a position for many years.

309
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,621
[SPEAKER_14]: For some of you, that may be a con.

310
00:47:04,142 --> 00:47:05,583
[SPEAKER_14]: For some, it may be a pro.

311
00:47:06,804 --> 00:47:17,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Personal preference, but for a person who has been around, and I can honestly say and tell you I've been on many sides and have seen our administration work, where many of you have not,

312
00:47:18,618 --> 00:47:22,003
[SPEAKER_14]: I can tell you we have and are represented very well across the state.

313
00:47:22,844 --> 00:47:24,666
[SPEAKER_14]: I know this is not the point for many of you.

314
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:27,210
[SPEAKER_14]: You are asking for transparency in the process.

315
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:33,839
[SPEAKER_14]: Educated in what the superintendent search entails and knowing what other cities are going through right now,

316
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:39,357
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that we as a school committee need to sit down and discuss.

317
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:45,602
[SPEAKER_14]: We have had certain maybe not official meetings, but the discussion has come up.

318
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:48,485
[SPEAKER_14]: But we need to have certain things done in succession.

319
00:47:49,206 --> 00:47:53,089
[SPEAKER_14]: As I mentioned before, the superintendent has already spoken to us.

320
00:47:53,249 --> 00:47:59,775
[SPEAKER_14]: We already knew when the evaluation is going to be presented to us as far as what the next step was going to be.

321
00:48:03,475 --> 00:48:09,423
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I guess at this point, I just really want to say that we are very much aware of what's going on.

322
00:48:09,984 --> 00:48:17,635
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's kind of frustrating as a school committee member to sit there and know the hard work that people in our city have done.

323
00:48:18,588 --> 00:48:22,669
[SPEAKER_14]: The children that were here tonight, that shows what we have in our schools.

324
00:48:23,209 --> 00:48:26,170
[SPEAKER_14]: Not only in the group that was here this evening, but in many groups.

325
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:34,652
[SPEAKER_14]: This last month and a half, we have done nothing but give certificates out, not from us, but what our children have achieved in the state of Massachusetts.

326
00:48:35,152 --> 00:48:42,714
[SPEAKER_14]: So to sit and listen over and over again, to listen to people just throw things out that are not factual is very frustrating.

327
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:47,916
[SPEAKER_14]: So with all due respect, I do and ask that I make a motion this evening

328
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:55,941
[SPEAKER_14]: that we have the meeting of the superintendent committee of the whole for the superintendent's evaluation.

329
00:48:56,481 --> 00:49:07,668
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we also need to have the meeting of executive, the executive meeting, I'm sorry, the executive committee of, executive meeting for his contract.

330
00:49:09,509 --> 00:49:10,850
[SPEAKER_18]: If I could just make an announcement.

331
00:49:23,078 --> 00:49:25,479
[SPEAKER_18]: If I could just make one announcement.

332
00:49:25,539 --> 00:49:33,423
[SPEAKER_18]: We have scheduled a Committee of the Whole for June 2nd to go over the superintendent's self-review of himself.

333
00:49:34,103 --> 00:49:38,725
[SPEAKER_18]: And at that point, we will be evaluating him, and then we will move forward in the process.

334
00:49:39,405 --> 00:49:46,949
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just like to follow up to that to say that I am actually a very proud product of Medford Public Schools.

335
00:49:47,209 --> 00:49:49,270
[SPEAKER_06]: My children attend Medford Public Schools.

336
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:51,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I am extraordinarily aware

337
00:49:52,116 --> 00:49:57,042
[SPEAKER_06]: of what Medford Public Schools have done, what they can do, and I hope to God what they will do.

338
00:49:57,823 --> 00:50:04,191
[SPEAKER_06]: So for you to sit there and say that I don't appreciate what goes on in the Medford Public Schools is an outright travesty.

339
00:50:04,592 --> 00:50:08,417
[SPEAKER_06]: With that being said, I am not asking you

340
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:13,296
[SPEAKER_06]: to simply sit there and say if you're going to renew or not renew Mr. Belson's contract.

341
00:50:13,336 --> 00:50:18,079
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm asking you is to have a transparent process if it has to happen.

342
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,863
[SPEAKER_06]: If, God forbid, he couldn't perform his job tomorrow, what is the process?

343
00:50:23,284 --> 00:50:24,705
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll say it's transparent.

344
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:31,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, then why did I stand here in front of you in April and not one of you had the audacity, not one of you could say anything to me?

345
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:33,852
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't acknowledge that I was here.

346
00:50:34,933 --> 00:50:36,615
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't tell me that's transparent.

347
00:50:38,054 --> 00:50:39,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Benedetto.

348
00:50:39,595 --> 00:50:39,995
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

349
00:50:40,396 --> 00:50:41,036
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

350
00:50:41,356 --> 00:50:42,717
[SPEAKER_18]: Point of personal privilege, Ms.

351
00:50:42,737 --> 00:50:43,138
[SPEAKER_18]: Cuno.

352
00:50:43,578 --> 00:50:45,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Angela, I didn't say it was you.

353
00:50:45,159 --> 00:50:45,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm saying in general.

354
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I'm the one standing up.

355
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:55,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I said thank you to you when you first came, and I said it a couple of times, actually, that I enjoy that when you do come, this is where the forum should be.

356
00:50:56,647 --> 00:51:03,172
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very, very frustrating to be on this side, too, just as much as it is for you that you want to do the best you possibly can for your children.

357
00:51:03,872 --> 00:51:10,384
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's very frustrating on this side working the hours that everybody works, not just me, I'm no one compared to everybody in this room.

358
00:51:11,286 --> 00:51:16,115
[SPEAKER_14]: But to sit here week after week and listen to everyone else discuss our

359
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Our due diligence of what we're doing for our children is very frustrating.

360
00:51:21,925 --> 00:51:24,188
[SPEAKER_14]: I've said it to you before and I will say it to you again.

361
00:51:24,348 --> 00:51:25,849
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for bringing this up to us.

362
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:30,134
[SPEAKER_14]: But you also have to understand that there is a process.

363
00:51:30,535 --> 00:51:33,678
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not saying that the process is behind closed doors.

364
00:51:33,999 --> 00:51:36,081
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't been in that situation in the past.

365
00:51:36,982 --> 00:51:38,243
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're absolutely right.

366
00:51:38,283 --> 00:51:43,868
[SPEAKER_14]: We've always talked about, if God forbid anything happens, that we want to know what's going to happen.

367
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:53,316
[SPEAKER_14]: But to sit here and know outside of this room that already there is people talking about, oh, we're hiring or we're firing, that's not fair to us.

368
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:55,518
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not saying that that was you.

369
00:51:56,058 --> 00:51:59,561
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that you have children in the system, because my children have been with your children.

370
00:52:00,342 --> 00:52:03,785
[SPEAKER_14]: So I am not getting more aggravated at you.

371
00:52:03,945 --> 00:52:05,386
[SPEAKER_14]: I thanked you for coming to us.

372
00:52:05,966 --> 00:52:10,069
[SPEAKER_14]: But you need to give us, you, the public, needs to give us some time.

373
00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:14,052
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there hasn't been time to sit down and do what we have to do.

374
00:52:14,392 --> 00:52:18,895
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's kind of ironic, we can't evaluate something if you have nothing to evaluate it from.

375
00:52:19,596 --> 00:52:22,358
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to evaluate the evening with the superintendent.

376
00:52:22,978 --> 00:52:27,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we have to wait for the evening of the superintendent, and that is coming up this week.

377
00:52:27,901 --> 00:52:32,763
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, I understand the frustration of everybody, but you also have to understand the frustration of us.

378
00:52:33,263 --> 00:52:37,125
[SPEAKER_14]: Me, myself, as a parent, totally understand, but I'm on both sides.

379
00:52:37,785 --> 00:52:46,630
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's very frustrating when you know your children are doing 100 percent the best they possibly can, and they're striving, and people just come to you and just

380
00:52:47,472 --> 00:52:49,893
[SPEAKER_14]: keep on saying facts that are not true.

381
00:52:50,253 --> 00:52:54,855
[SPEAKER_14]: If we're going to throw facts out there, let's remember, I don't know, a little bit of reality.

382
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:57,857
[SPEAKER_14]: And we sit here, I'm number one.

383
00:52:57,977 --> 00:53:01,418
[SPEAKER_14]: I started here 10 years ago with let's not bully anybody.

384
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:08,181
[SPEAKER_14]: What kind of a message are we sending as adults to our children that we say don't bully?

385
00:53:08,501 --> 00:53:09,802
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're at this point.

386
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:11,683
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very frustrating.

387
00:53:13,162 --> 00:53:13,862
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

388
00:53:13,882 --> 00:53:14,723
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Benedetto.

389
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:15,563
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

390
00:53:15,764 --> 00:53:17,665
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I don't agree with my colleague.

391
00:53:18,005 --> 00:53:23,288
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, when you came in April, I wish I had said something, but you did make me think.

392
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:26,070
[SPEAKER_16]: And I did request the superintendent's contract.

393
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:32,474
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's when I found out that as a school committee member, the June 30th date, I did not know that prior to that.

394
00:53:33,234 --> 00:53:41,999
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, I'm honest and truthful, but prior to that, there were discussions and there were requests and evaluation processes happening.

395
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:42,740
[SPEAKER_16]: So,

396
00:53:43,371 --> 00:53:47,835
[SPEAKER_16]: That actual date of June 30th, knowing that, that's where that came about.

397
00:53:48,095 --> 00:53:49,276
[SPEAKER_16]: And I brought it to a meeting.

398
00:53:49,985 --> 00:53:51,126
[SPEAKER_16]: after you came forward.

399
00:53:51,606 --> 00:54:03,453
[SPEAKER_16]: And I apologize because I know it's not easy to stand there in front of a body of people and a whole nother room full of people and just ask about a process and not making it personal.

400
00:54:03,593 --> 00:54:04,974
[SPEAKER_16]: I do this all the time.

401
00:54:05,514 --> 00:54:10,037
[SPEAKER_16]: I do it with asking for budgets and I do it for oh, so many things.

402
00:54:10,117 --> 00:54:12,279
[SPEAKER_16]: And people think I'm like, what do you want to know?

403
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:16,101
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to know what's happening so I can make good judgments.

404
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:18,182
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's what's happening here.

405
00:54:18,742 --> 00:54:19,483
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that

406
00:54:20,097 --> 00:54:28,344
[SPEAKER_16]: The stuff going on, the parents making comments and bring them up, most of them

407
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:33,099
[SPEAKER_16]: Not all of them, but most of them, about the process.

408
00:54:33,439 --> 00:54:34,219
[SPEAKER_16]: What do we do?

409
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:38,840
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had a great run with Superintendent Bellson.

410
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,901
[SPEAKER_16]: We wouldn't have our science labs without him.

411
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:43,141
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that.

412
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:45,101
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that better than anyone.

413
00:54:45,261 --> 00:54:49,482
[SPEAKER_16]: He came to this meeting and presented it, and it's amazing that we have that.

414
00:54:49,762 --> 00:54:52,923
[SPEAKER_16]: That got one third of our high school building remodeled at the same time.

415
00:54:53,383 --> 00:55:00,289
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I watched in awe as that happened in front of me and made sure that it expanded our whole vocational education.

416
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:05,333
[SPEAKER_16]: And he's done so many wonderful things, but that does not mean he's going to be here forever.

417
00:55:05,714 --> 00:55:07,695
[SPEAKER_16]: And we do need to start the process.

418
00:55:08,176 --> 00:55:10,518
[SPEAKER_16]: I have asked for his self-evaluation.

419
00:55:10,938 --> 00:55:15,122
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as I've been told from him, he is going to provide that to us today.

420
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:18,885
[SPEAKER_16]: May 16th is the date he told us at a prior meeting.

421
00:55:19,265 --> 00:55:21,447
[SPEAKER_16]: I was looking forward to seeing that this evening.

422
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:25,454
[SPEAKER_16]: If that date has changed, he can correct me and tell me why that's changed.

423
00:55:25,775 --> 00:55:32,379
[SPEAKER_16]: But we need sufficient time to go over his self-evaluation and do our evaluation that we do every year.

424
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:33,719
[SPEAKER_16]: We do this every year.

425
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,981
[SPEAKER_16]: And every year, I talk about his strengths.

426
00:55:36,381 --> 00:55:41,064
[SPEAKER_16]: And every year, I talk about areas of growth, just like anyone in any job.

427
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:49,089
[SPEAKER_16]: And whether or not he has the option of deciding whether he's coming back, but he doesn't have to tell us until September 1st.

428
00:55:49,209 --> 00:55:50,390
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what the contract says.

429
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:58,896
[SPEAKER_16]: My obligation as a school committee member and to the people who voted me into this seat is to make sure you feel that it's transparent.

430
00:55:59,336 --> 00:56:06,221
[SPEAKER_16]: If you ever have a question, I will answer it honestly as to the process and what happened in my eyes and in my viewpoint.

431
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:08,943
[SPEAKER_16]: So I commend you for being here.

432
00:56:09,703 --> 00:56:11,224
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that we're going to move forward.

433
00:56:11,304 --> 00:56:14,046
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm very happy to have the meeting on the second.

434
00:56:14,366 --> 00:56:19,090
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like the superintendent's evaluation prior to that so we can provide our

435
00:56:20,272 --> 00:56:25,740
[SPEAKER_16]: evaluations of him on that evening so that way we commit and meet our deadlines.

436
00:56:26,141 --> 00:56:36,055
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would like it published in a way that all of our community understands that we're doing this like we did last year, like we did the year prior.

437
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:45,018
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to be disrespectful to a person, but I want the process to be more clear, more understandable.

438
00:56:45,778 --> 00:56:50,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe this year we want to—we've always had the opportunity for people to come and speak.

439
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:57,541
[SPEAKER_16]: We usually don't have that in our audience, and I'm glad to see that some people are here and lined up to speak.

440
00:56:58,221 --> 00:57:01,702
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's a time for when we do his evaluation.

441
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:10,424
[SPEAKER_16]: That might not be tonight, but if you feel like you're here and you're ready to speak, I am more than happy to hear every single person in this room.

442
00:57:11,406 --> 00:57:11,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

443
00:57:12,126 --> 00:57:14,347
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's my take in all of this.

444
00:57:14,547 --> 00:57:16,708
[SPEAKER_16]: I commend you for coming forward April 3rd.

445
00:57:16,828 --> 00:57:21,871
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause you, you started some me thinking and my actions moving forward.

446
00:57:22,291 --> 00:57:30,574
[SPEAKER_16]: So I don't know if the superintendent is still planning on providing us that information this evening, and maybe we can figure out a timeline right now.

447
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:36,857
[SPEAKER_16]: And I applaud my colleague as far as setting up dates and moving forward and calling for a committee of the whole.

448
00:57:38,178 --> 00:57:38,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

449
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:38,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Krutz.

450
00:57:39,173 --> 00:57:39,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, hi, Angela.

451
00:57:39,953 --> 00:57:41,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for coming out tonight.

452
00:57:41,174 --> 00:57:46,235
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I, I did respond to your email and I let you know that, you know, I'm new.

453
00:57:46,836 --> 00:57:48,236
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of other new people here.

454
00:57:48,316 --> 00:57:54,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And that night, typically we get an agenda and it tells us what's going to be on the agenda that night.

455
00:57:55,118 --> 00:57:57,039
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get the information that we can read through.

456
00:57:57,539 --> 00:58:00,600
[SPEAKER_03]: So the night that you were here, you weren't on the agenda.

457
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I really haven't experienced a lot of people coming that aren't on the agenda.

458
00:58:05,342 --> 00:58:08,443
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't have any information to even speak on.

459
00:58:08,923 --> 00:58:10,564
[SPEAKER_03]: the evaluation of the superintendent.

460
00:58:11,124 --> 00:58:33,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I know from my work experience where I work, I work at Mass Teachers Retirement System, and I work with over 40 school districts, and I hear from my payroll people all the time how upsetting it is when they see a superintendent go, because they get a superintendent when somebody retires, and the superintendents are coming and going all the time.

461
00:58:33,976 --> 00:58:38,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they come and go, they also come in and they reorganize.

462
00:58:38,565 --> 00:58:43,629
[SPEAKER_03]: and they get their staff in there or their administration in there, and they set new rules.

463
00:58:44,009 --> 00:58:48,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it sends a lot of teachers off going and a lot of people moving out of the community.

464
00:58:48,673 --> 00:59:00,963
[SPEAKER_03]: So I agree with my colleagues that we need to take a lot of time doing the search, because we don't want to get somebody from Chicago, which I've just heard from one of my school districts, because they lost their superintendent.

465
00:59:01,303 --> 00:59:07,588
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a new superintendent for two years after training the new superintendent, and now they have somebody from Chicago coming.

466
00:59:08,223 --> 00:59:10,425
[SPEAKER_03]: who doesn't know anything about their district.

467
00:59:10,725 --> 00:59:13,907
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that it's going to take time.

468
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:22,054
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much time, but we do have coming up the 23rd, I thought it was, is the evening with the superintendent.

469
00:59:22,094 --> 00:59:24,615
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for the public, where everybody can go.

470
00:59:25,076 --> 00:59:26,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're invited to go as well.

471
00:59:26,777 --> 00:59:31,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to take notes, because what I heard was that we could take notes at the meeting.

472
00:59:31,421 --> 00:59:35,263
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of the meetings in all the past have been public meetings.

473
00:59:35,624 --> 00:59:37,245
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the minutes are available.

474
00:59:37,655 --> 00:59:39,275
[SPEAKER_03]: which is transparent.

475
00:59:40,836 --> 00:59:47,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I didn't have time to go and look for all those meeting minutes, but it's all available at any time for anybody to get.

476
00:59:48,277 --> 00:59:50,477
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of, I know where I work.

477
00:59:50,497 --> 00:59:52,438
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to go into the archive bulletins.

478
00:59:52,818 --> 00:59:56,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be something like that because we have so much data to go into the websites.

479
00:59:56,698 --> 01:00:04,080
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be in a different area that we might have to reach somebody in the IT or the technical office to find out exactly where they are.

480
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:06,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I don't know, but no, I think

481
01:00:07,197 --> 01:00:16,220
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's definitely something we have to consider and take a lot of time to do the search to actually get another superstar like Roy, because he's been doing a terrific job.

482
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:20,201
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, students rave about what he's doing, parents rave about what he's doing.

483
01:00:21,661 --> 01:00:29,403
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have a lot of good, positive feedback, and I do appreciate everything you've said, and I hope you got my email when I responded.

484
01:00:29,643 --> 01:00:30,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I did, thank you.

485
01:00:30,304 --> 01:00:30,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

486
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:35,991
[SPEAKER_06]: not here specifically discussing Superintendent Belson's contract.

487
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:39,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here speaking about a plan that should be in place, like what you're saying.

488
01:00:40,412 --> 01:00:42,693
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want someone to come in and then have it not work.

489
01:00:43,193 --> 01:00:49,875
[SPEAKER_06]: So you need a plan in place so that if you do need to replace someone, there's certain steps that you go by.

490
01:00:50,015 --> 01:00:52,236
[SPEAKER_06]: If there is a process, it should be public.

491
01:00:52,276 --> 01:00:53,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said, there is a process.

492
01:00:53,476 --> 01:00:55,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I have no idea what that process is.

493
01:00:55,837 --> 01:00:59,478
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I stood here on April 11th, nobody shared with me what that process was.

494
01:01:00,028 --> 01:01:06,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody said, there will be this, there will be X, Y, and Z, and by June 30th, we will have something to say.

495
01:01:07,071 --> 01:01:08,211
[SPEAKER_06]: That's transparency.

496
01:01:09,352 --> 01:01:14,934
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just went to a training along with a couple of my colleagues, and we went to the training.

497
01:01:14,974 --> 01:01:18,095
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for new school committee members.

498
01:01:18,515 --> 01:01:23,598
[SPEAKER_03]: So I received the certification probably, I think, two weeks ago.

499
01:01:24,178 --> 01:01:25,878
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the exact date.

500
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:27,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was actually the day before Mother's Day.

501
01:01:27,699 --> 01:01:29,720
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was not this week, it was the week before.

502
01:01:30,147 --> 01:01:39,775
[SPEAKER_03]: and we got a booklet and we, you know, there's a lot of information that we have available, including help from the MASC to conduct a superintendent search.

503
01:01:40,175 --> 01:01:45,800
[SPEAKER_03]: They assist with the superintendent search and they gave us a little, you know, a little handout.

504
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So they also can help us conduct the search.

505
01:01:51,144 --> 01:01:55,128
[SPEAKER_03]: And with any questions that we have as a committee, you know, to help us with the search.

506
01:01:55,188 --> 01:01:56,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm not experienced with this.

507
01:01:57,149 --> 01:01:57,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never done it.

508
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:04,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if any of the colleagues here have done it because Mr. Belson has been the superintendent.

509
01:02:04,215 --> 01:02:06,596
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's going to be new for all of us.

510
01:02:07,277 --> 01:02:10,119
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, at the same time, it's going to be a work in process where

511
01:02:10,503 --> 01:02:28,872
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I think we're all going to learn from this experience and like we've been doing with all the other procedures, we've been documenting and we've been writing instructions and new procedures and we've been reviewing the procedures as a group before we make a motion to put it on the table before we publish it.

512
01:02:29,172 --> 01:02:34,674
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been, you know, doing that, you know, as we, I mean, during committee of the whole meetings.

513
01:02:35,254 --> 01:02:36,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I think it's,

514
01:02:36,759 --> 01:02:38,960
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, you know, definitely in the works.

515
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:52,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, where it's so close to the superintendent night and so close to his evaluation, I, you know, I wish the timing was different and we had some more answers for you tonight, but I'm very glad that you've come out, you know, to talk to us.

516
01:02:53,366 --> 01:02:53,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

517
01:02:54,166 --> 01:02:54,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

518
01:02:57,475 --> 01:03:13,009
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to back up for a second and remind everybody here that actually I've been through two superintendent searches already, but first for Superintendent DeVoe, an outside candidate, and secondly for Superintendent Belson, who was an internal candidate at the time.

519
01:03:13,655 --> 01:03:15,657
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've actually got a little bit of experience.

520
01:03:16,677 --> 01:03:32,429
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, I just want to assure everybody that there is no way, and I kind of recoil from your word haphazard, that I would allow this to be a haphazard process for picking the most important job that we have in our school system.

521
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:42,217
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, if you go back, when I ran for school committee this time, one of the things I talked about was that we will be entering a transition period.

522
01:03:42,617 --> 01:03:52,763
[SPEAKER_13]: and it will be vitally important that we take our time and we do due diligence and we have a very successful transition.

523
01:03:52,863 --> 01:04:08,272
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's particularly because I am involved and have been involved on the statewide level at the MASC and we've talked to our colleagues from other districts who've done superintendent searches and we've gotten, Anne Marie and I have gotten some pretty good feedback

524
01:04:08,632 --> 01:04:15,096
[SPEAKER_13]: We've also had the opportunity to talk, you know, they will do superintendent searches.

525
01:04:15,156 --> 01:04:21,739
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a process with them that we could choose to, at the time, ask for their assistance.

526
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:26,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, no decision like that has been made, but we are well aware of that as a potential.

527
01:04:27,182 --> 01:04:31,885
[SPEAKER_13]: By the way, Angela, I did want to tell you that I did not receive an email from you, and that's been a problem.

528
01:04:31,925 --> 01:04:37,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Somehow emails that are sent directly to the school are not coming to me, so use my Gmail address.

529
01:04:37,814 --> 01:04:38,074
[SPEAKER_13]: please.

530
01:04:39,135 --> 01:04:51,460
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, no way would I allow someone with 26 years of experience on the Medford School Committee, who lives and breathes this job, would I allow this to be a haphazard process.

531
01:04:52,781 --> 01:04:58,503
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to remind everybody that this year, we've had three new school committees join us.

532
01:04:59,044 --> 01:04:59,204
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

533
01:04:59,244 --> 01:04:59,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Kretz,

534
01:05:00,477 --> 01:05:00,657
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

535
01:05:00,697 --> 01:05:03,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Mostoni, and in fact the mayor, is new.

536
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,941
[SPEAKER_13]: They joined us in January.

537
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:10,747
[SPEAKER_13]: That was not the time to spring into action to do the superintendent's evaluation.

538
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:20,356
[SPEAKER_13]: They needed an opportunity to work with the superintendent and find out for themselves what kind of man he is.

539
01:05:21,419 --> 01:05:29,067
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't just go and evaluate somebody who you've only worked for for six weeks.

540
01:05:29,748 --> 01:05:33,332
[SPEAKER_13]: So our evaluation process is a little later this year, okay?

541
01:05:33,432 --> 01:05:34,593
[SPEAKER_13]: It is going to happen.

542
01:05:34,954 --> 01:05:37,577
[SPEAKER_13]: The evening with the superintendent is going to happen.

543
01:05:37,977 --> 01:05:40,340
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have it no other way.

544
01:05:43,498 --> 01:05:58,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes it feels like there's another elephant in the room, and certainly there are some citizens that would prefer the superintendent not to perhaps indicate that he would like to stay another year or so on top of his current contract.

545
01:05:59,544 --> 01:06:01,105
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's all very interesting, this.

546
01:06:02,118 --> 01:06:07,839
[SPEAKER_13]: The superintendent is a man who has to make some tough decisions, and he has to lead, and he's been our leader.

547
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:29,284
[SPEAKER_13]: He has a backbone, and so he's spoken out about things like the drain of finances that was caused by our students going to Minuteman, and he worked hard to end that procession out and to, in fact, then booster our own Medford Vocational School so that it would be the jewel that it is growing to be.

548
01:06:29,624 --> 01:06:31,625
[SPEAKER_13]: We're so proud of that, such a change.

549
01:06:32,525 --> 01:06:39,669
[SPEAKER_13]: He talks out on a statewide level about the inequity of charter school funding and the problems of the funding formula.

550
01:06:40,469 --> 01:06:54,156
[SPEAKER_13]: And every so often, he gets really pissed off, and he speaks inappropriately, perhaps, to a citizen, and that's my view, and I can tell every single one of you that when I feel he's crossed a line, I'm the first one to tell him.

551
01:06:56,397 --> 01:06:58,158
[SPEAKER_13]: But he is a magnificent leader here.

552
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:01,027
[SPEAKER_13]: he will be hard to replace.

553
01:07:01,988 --> 01:07:20,805
[SPEAKER_13]: We will also need to look about and think very strongly about, and I've actually already had some discussions with the superintendent himself, which at some point along the line when we sit down, the whole school committee will have to consider not only his role, but what is the role of the other people who might, because he's leaving, decide to go with him.

554
01:07:21,466 --> 01:07:23,948
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a bigger picture than just the superintendent.

555
01:07:24,978 --> 01:07:28,301
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, you said to us, why didn't we say anything to you in April?

556
01:07:28,321 --> 01:07:29,361
[SPEAKER_13]: We were coming up cold.

557
01:07:29,401 --> 01:07:30,222
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't know you were coming.

558
01:07:30,762 --> 01:07:34,525
[SPEAKER_13]: I hadn't looked at the date on the superintendent's contract that night, okay?

559
01:07:34,985 --> 01:07:36,366
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a school vacation week.

560
01:07:36,707 --> 01:07:38,788
[SPEAKER_13]: We've gone through incredibly busy weeks.

561
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,931
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if people realize how busy this school committee is.

562
01:07:42,651 --> 01:07:47,695
[SPEAKER_13]: One week I was out so many nights, and look, this is just, we're here today, May 16th.

563
01:07:47,735 --> 01:07:49,076
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a meeting on May 17th.

564
01:07:49,096 --> 01:07:50,237
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a meeting on May 18th.

565
01:07:50,277 --> 01:07:51,518
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a meeting on May 23rd.

566
01:07:51,558 --> 01:07:53,320
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a meeting on May 24th.

567
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:54,981
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the M Club dinner on the 25th.

568
01:07:55,481 --> 01:07:56,562
[SPEAKER_13]: We have 6th, 7th, 8th.

569
01:07:57,243 --> 01:07:59,084
[SPEAKER_13]: We are incredibly busy.

570
01:07:59,224 --> 01:08:01,346
[SPEAKER_13]: It is, we have to get all of us together.

571
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:02,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, should this be a priority?

572
01:08:03,027 --> 01:08:03,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

573
01:08:03,908 --> 01:08:06,711
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would hold that we are taking our steps.

574
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:10,335
[SPEAKER_13]: The superintendent will give us his evaluation.

575
01:08:10,936 --> 01:08:13,139
[SPEAKER_13]: We will deliberate on that evaluation.

576
01:08:13,499 --> 01:08:18,184
[SPEAKER_13]: We will ask him for his preferences regarding a contract and we will deliberate on that.

577
01:08:19,045 --> 01:08:19,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay?

578
01:08:20,245 --> 01:08:34,488
[SPEAKER_13]: We will go through the extraordinary busy time of getting the budget, and we need to realize that the superintendent and his, everybody in the administration needs to spend time to put that budget together.

579
01:08:35,008 --> 01:08:36,668
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the time of year it is.

580
01:08:36,688 --> 01:08:45,570
[SPEAKER_13]: I assure you that this will not be a haphazard process, and I want to add, over my dead body.

581
01:08:58,543 --> 01:08:58,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms.

582
01:08:58,763 --> 01:09:01,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Mustone.

583
01:09:01,467 --> 01:09:02,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Angela, thank you for being here.

584
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:13,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what you've been saying is it's about the process and transparent, which I think we've been successful since January with a new security policy and that wouldn't have happened without parents' voice.

585
01:09:13,622 --> 01:09:17,006
[SPEAKER_04]: We have community schools discussion, that wouldn't have happened without parents' voice.

586
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:17,807
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think

587
01:09:18,533 --> 01:09:21,173
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless, Mr. Bellson, I'm glad you're here and you're well right now.

588
01:09:21,454 --> 01:09:29,555
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to just have a policy that we can share with the community about how we're moving forward with dates, all those dates that we've rattled off that I haven't even kept track of.

589
01:09:29,975 --> 01:09:32,355
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to thank Angela for being here for the other parents.

590
01:09:32,395 --> 01:09:36,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm interested in hearing them because it seems like things get done when it comes from the parents, not from us.

591
01:09:37,316 --> 01:09:38,497
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for being here.

592
01:09:38,517 --> 01:09:39,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

593
01:09:39,817 --> 01:09:41,777
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Superintendent would like to clarify some.

594
01:09:43,557 --> 01:09:44,378
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Madam Mayor.

595
01:09:46,538 --> 01:09:46,678
[SPEAKER_23]: So,

596
01:09:48,668 --> 01:09:56,130
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been here 21 years now as superintendent, 48 years as a public educator in the city of Medford.

597
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:57,750
[SPEAKER_23]: I grew up in the community.

598
01:09:57,950 --> 01:09:58,810
[SPEAKER_23]: I went to the schools.

599
01:09:58,850 --> 01:09:59,950
[SPEAKER_23]: I went to the Forest Park.

600
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:02,491
[SPEAKER_23]: I went to the Roberts Junior High School.

601
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:03,611
[SPEAKER_23]: I went to Medford High School.

602
01:10:05,671 --> 01:10:07,492
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is my community.

603
01:10:08,392 --> 01:10:09,132
[SPEAKER_23]: I care about it.

604
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:18,334
[SPEAKER_23]: And as I've said before, I never intend or would never intend to make a decision that would leave my community

605
01:10:18,962 --> 01:10:19,442
[SPEAKER_23]: in the lurch.

606
01:10:21,082 --> 01:10:33,805
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, having said that, we have had a process of evaluation and decision-making that has gone back well before my term as superintendent, and it's always been transparent.

607
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:38,145
[SPEAKER_23]: My self-evaluation will come to the committee this week.

608
01:10:39,346 --> 01:10:39,866
[SPEAKER_23]: You'll have it.

609
01:10:40,446 --> 01:10:42,246
[SPEAKER_23]: You'll have more than two weeks to go over it.

610
01:10:43,266 --> 01:10:47,287
[SPEAKER_23]: That's a pretty substantial period of time to look at the document, which takes me time,

611
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:54,151
[SPEAKER_23]: to produce and review given all the other responsibilities that we have in the school district.

612
01:10:56,052 --> 01:10:57,533
[SPEAKER_23]: The process will be in public.

613
01:10:58,293 --> 01:10:58,913
[SPEAKER_23]: It always is.

614
01:11:00,274 --> 01:11:00,914
[SPEAKER_23]: Open session.

615
01:11:00,954 --> 01:11:02,295
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not an executive session.

616
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:04,175
[SPEAKER_23]: It's not away from anyone.

617
01:11:05,336 --> 01:11:13,159
[SPEAKER_23]: It's open and every committee member has an opportunity to say what they feel and make whatever ratings they want to make.

618
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:15,300
[SPEAKER_23]: So far they've been good.

619
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:22,501
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sure that there may be some things that people would like to see me do better, or the school system do better.

620
01:11:23,482 --> 01:11:25,202
[SPEAKER_23]: But clearly, it's been an open process.

621
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:39,608
[SPEAKER_23]: And as you can tell, people come to the rail all the time and make statements, give their opinions, come into meetings, some of them in support, and some of them critical.

622
01:11:40,488 --> 01:11:41,609
[SPEAKER_23]: But that's a balancing act.

623
01:11:41,889 --> 01:11:44,090
[SPEAKER_23]: Wherever we are, that's what takes place.

624
01:11:46,585 --> 01:11:54,730
[SPEAKER_23]: What does concern me is this, and I say this in a very sincere way, and that's simply this.

625
01:11:55,911 --> 01:12:10,319
[SPEAKER_23]: Whether I stay or go, when I go, if an outside individual is going to consider the Medford Public Schools as his or her home, as superintendent, they are going to evaluate the environment.

626
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:14,822
[SPEAKER_23]: And if they feel the environment is hostile, they're not coming here.

627
01:12:16,318 --> 01:12:28,624
[SPEAKER_23]: They're not coming here because it's a tough enough job not to be in a situation where people are divided and split along many issues.

628
01:12:29,744 --> 01:12:41,290
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's our responsibility to have a decent dialogue, to make an appropriate decision, but to keep it intelligent and to keep it

629
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:53,574
[SPEAKER_23]: welcoming, so that when someone does consider applying for the Medford Public Schools, they say, I want to go there, because that's a good place to be a superintendent of schools.

630
01:12:54,054 --> 01:13:00,198
[SPEAKER_23]: The people support the administration, they support their school committee, and there's mutual respect.

631
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:03,240
[SPEAKER_23]: And so that's really what we've got to strive for.

632
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:05,702
[SPEAKER_23]: A decision will be made.

633
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:09,456
[SPEAKER_23]: Decision will happen in public session.

634
01:13:09,476 --> 01:13:12,037
[SPEAKER_23]: Decision will happen after a lot of consultation.

635
01:13:12,698 --> 01:13:21,942
[SPEAKER_23]: And a lot of the things that we have to decide are based on, am I a person at this point in time able to bring forward our agenda in an intelligent way?

636
01:13:22,682 --> 01:13:26,244
[SPEAKER_23]: Or is someone else maybe better positioned to do that at this point in time?

637
01:13:27,404 --> 01:13:28,064
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what it's about.

638
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:30,085
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what it's about.

639
01:13:30,966 --> 01:13:34,527
[SPEAKER_23]: So let's have our process.

640
01:13:34,967 --> 01:13:36,028
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's respect each other.

641
01:13:36,893 --> 01:13:43,634
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's continue to work together, and let's make a decision in a timely way on behalf of the community.

642
01:13:44,434 --> 01:13:46,315
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, superintendent searches vary.

643
01:13:47,455 --> 01:13:49,975
[SPEAKER_23]: Many of them are done in a lot shorter time than a year.

644
01:13:50,515 --> 01:13:56,917
[SPEAKER_23]: But if that's the community's wish, then that's something we'd go forward with.

645
01:13:58,237 --> 01:14:04,258
[SPEAKER_23]: But I've observed a lot of searches over the years, and people call me all the time because I've been around for a long time.

646
01:14:05,475 --> 01:14:09,696
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think that it's important we go through our process.

647
01:14:10,757 --> 01:14:17,519
[SPEAKER_23]: It's also informative to go through the process, because the things I will bring to you in the self-evaluation will remind you of things you've done.

648
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:22,540
[SPEAKER_23]: Even when I'm writing up the evaluation myself, I'm saying to myself, oh, I forgot we did this.

649
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,421
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I forgot this actually happened.

650
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:26,041
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, this, yes, was a concern.

651
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:27,242
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, we dealt with this.

652
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:31,063
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a process of re-educating ourselves about all the things that are going on.

653
01:14:31,966 --> 01:14:36,209
[SPEAKER_23]: It's also a message that we send to our administration, faculty, and staff.

654
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:40,411
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's important that we do it right.

655
01:14:41,152 --> 01:14:43,973
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's important that we have the right kind of discussion.

656
01:14:44,754 --> 01:14:55,781
[SPEAKER_23]: And that we not create a leverage situation where decisions are made on the fly, or decisions are made without proper dialogue and discussion and process.

657
01:14:56,481 --> 01:14:58,803
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm very confident that you will do that.

658
01:14:59,183 --> 01:15:00,944
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm very confident that we will have

659
01:15:02,037 --> 01:15:06,180
[SPEAKER_23]: a good discussion and that a proper appropriate decision will be made.

660
01:15:07,241 --> 01:15:11,704
[SPEAKER_23]: So thank you for your ongoing support.

661
01:15:13,365 --> 01:15:18,088
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for your interest in perhaps making sure the community has a proper transition.

662
01:15:18,869 --> 01:15:20,870
[SPEAKER_23]: But at the same time, let's make sure we do it right.

663
01:15:21,911 --> 01:15:24,813
[SPEAKER_23]: And so you will get my self evaluation at the end of the week.

664
01:15:25,639 --> 01:15:31,144
[SPEAKER_23]: And by the way, it's important that people respect the fact that you're the elected members of this community.

665
01:15:31,164 --> 01:15:34,647
[SPEAKER_23]: You have a right to look at this stuff before the rest of the world comments on it.

666
01:15:35,128 --> 01:15:37,109
[SPEAKER_23]: You work with me all the time.

667
01:15:38,391 --> 01:15:47,739
[SPEAKER_23]: And conversely, I believe I have a right to make sure that the people who work with me all the time get the first pass at commenting on what goes on.

668
01:15:50,077 --> 01:15:51,078
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we're in a good place.

669
01:15:51,759 --> 01:15:53,141
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it will go well.

670
01:15:54,042 --> 01:15:59,830
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think people will be pleased that a good transparent process has taken place.

671
01:16:00,451 --> 01:16:02,134
[SPEAKER_23]: That's all we all want.

672
01:16:02,154 --> 01:16:04,457
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

673
01:16:26,553 --> 01:16:27,454
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

674
01:16:28,014 --> 01:16:33,876
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to also comment that there is a lot of support in the in the galley for the superintendent.

675
01:16:34,257 --> 01:16:44,241
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that a lot of teachers heard that this was going to be on the agenda and in parents and they wanted to come out and show their support and that's why the room is full and it's very nice to see.

676
01:16:44,561 --> 01:16:48,863
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's also a lot of people here that just want to bring forward the process.

677
01:16:49,263 --> 01:17:03,309
[SPEAKER_16]: So in that, taking that into account, I motion that the superintendent provide us with his evaluation by Friday, May 20th, to all school committee members.

678
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:09,111
[SPEAKER_16]: That's four days after I thought we were going to get it, but that's my first motion.

679
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:16,214
[SPEAKER_16]: And my second motion is for us to meet on June 6th to

680
01:17:16,865 --> 01:17:20,448
[SPEAKER_16]: to provide the superintendent with our feedback and his evaluation.

681
01:17:20,548 --> 01:17:22,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Is the committee meeting scheduled for June 2nd?

682
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:23,191
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, 2nd.

683
01:17:23,211 --> 01:17:23,631
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

684
01:17:23,671 --> 01:17:24,032
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

685
01:17:24,052 --> 01:17:27,475
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I'm trying to get is the date so it's clear to the whole committee.

686
01:17:28,175 --> 01:17:29,116
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would like that.

687
01:17:29,437 --> 01:17:35,282
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm making a motion to have that on the agenda so that the whole community knows when everything's going to be.

688
01:17:35,927 --> 01:17:44,691
[SPEAKER_16]: about and if they need to come and make additional comments, they're welcome to come that evening and hear our evaluation as well of the superintendent that we do every year.

689
01:17:45,311 --> 01:17:56,116
[SPEAKER_16]: And then my last motion would be to have, as a committee, have a succession plan in process on the record by June 30th, 2016.

690
01:17:57,076 --> 01:18:03,759
[SPEAKER_16]: And it doesn't have to be, we as a committee have to provide the superintendent on that date

691
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:06,965
[SPEAKER_16]: whether we are extending his contract.

692
01:18:07,325 --> 01:18:21,928
[SPEAKER_16]: But in addition to that, this motion is about making ourselves accountable to a date to have a secession plan in place, whether or not we extend the superintendent's contract a year or so.

693
01:18:22,328 --> 01:18:28,510
[SPEAKER_16]: So that way, if something were to happen, and life things happen, we have a plan in place.

694
01:18:29,994 --> 01:18:33,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Belson is continuing on as our superintendent or not.

695
01:18:33,816 --> 01:18:41,600
[SPEAKER_16]: We can go back to that plan, just like a master plan, and put that in effect if anything were to arise at any moment's notice.

696
01:18:41,980 --> 01:18:46,042
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm asking for a second to my motion of all three items.

697
01:18:47,943 --> 01:18:48,624
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a second.

698
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:50,385
[SPEAKER_18]: If we could take them separately.

699
01:18:50,505 --> 01:18:54,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion for the self-evaluation to be provided to the school committee by Friday.

700
01:18:56,203 --> 01:18:56,823
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a question.

701
01:18:56,843 --> 01:19:04,568
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that the contract reads that we have to inform the superintendent by June 30 if our intention is not to rehire him.

702
01:19:04,728 --> 01:19:05,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that correct?

703
01:19:05,829 --> 01:19:06,730
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't say not.

704
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:10,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have a copy of it before?

705
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:11,753
[SPEAKER_13]: I brought it too.

706
01:19:12,493 --> 01:19:14,355
[SPEAKER_13]: Could you just read the first sentence or that sentence?

707
01:19:19,458 --> 01:19:20,679
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Mayor, would you like me to read it?

708
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:21,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Certainly.

709
01:19:21,499 --> 01:19:22,660
[SPEAKER_18]: You're right at the line.

710
01:19:33,091 --> 01:19:34,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, term.

711
01:19:34,352 --> 01:19:42,436
[SPEAKER_16]: The superintendent shall be employed for a two-year period commencing July 1st, 2015, ending June 30th, 2017.

712
01:19:42,536 --> 01:19:51,001
[SPEAKER_16]: The school committee shall advise the superintendent of its intent to extend his contract.

713
01:19:52,082 --> 01:19:55,964
[SPEAKER_16]: The intent to extend his contract by June 30th.

714
01:19:56,104 --> 01:20:00,846
[SPEAKER_16]: We have to decide by that date whether we intend to extend it or not.

715
01:20:03,516 --> 01:20:05,057
[SPEAKER_16]: that we intend to extend it.

716
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:18,841
[SPEAKER_16]: If we do not tell him by that date, it also goes forward with the superintendent shall notify the school committee of his notice of obligation by September 1st, 2016.

717
01:20:20,822 --> 01:20:32,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Notice of school committee's intent to terminate the contract upon expiration must be given by certified mail, return address request to the superintendent at his address of records.

718
01:20:33,007 --> 01:20:45,558
[SPEAKER_16]: So we would have to, if as a committee we were not extending his contract, he would have to have notification to himself by June 30th, 2016 at his home address.

719
01:20:48,861 --> 01:20:49,982
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a motion on the floor.

720
01:20:50,042 --> 01:20:51,123
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a second by Ms.

721
01:20:51,163 --> 01:20:52,945
[SPEAKER_18]: Mostone on the first motion that Ms.

722
01:20:54,406 --> 01:20:54,607
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuno.

723
01:20:58,154 --> 01:21:02,055
[SPEAKER_14]: It says that we have to come up with a plan by June 30th also, is that your motion?

724
01:21:02,676 --> 01:21:04,036
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll take it one at a time.

725
01:21:04,417 --> 01:21:05,137
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the second one, okay.

726
01:21:05,157 --> 01:21:06,378
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to move them separately.

727
01:21:07,338 --> 01:21:07,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

728
01:21:07,478 --> 01:21:07,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

729
01:21:07,598 --> 01:21:08,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Vander Kloof.

730
01:21:08,579 --> 01:21:19,244
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I don't have any problem voting for the motion, but the superintendent has just told us that he's going to provide it to us by Friday, and he's just told us that we've got a meeting on the second.

731
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:23,326
[SPEAKER_13]: So, in fact, my colleague is, by putting it in motion, is making it sound as if

732
01:21:24,006 --> 01:21:26,447
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, she's doing something like a big deal.

733
01:21:26,767 --> 01:21:31,409
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just have to be clear that we've already put out and said that we're going to be doing these things.

734
01:21:31,769 --> 01:21:34,530
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no problem voting for it because we just said we'd do it.

735
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:36,631
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, I just want to be clear.

736
01:21:38,772 --> 01:21:39,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry.

737
01:21:40,292 --> 01:21:43,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it seems redundant to me.

738
01:21:44,034 --> 01:21:46,375
[SPEAKER_18]: That the self-evaluation be provided by Friday.

739
01:21:46,395 --> 01:21:47,355
[SPEAKER_18]: It's seconded by Ms.

740
01:21:47,395 --> 01:21:49,556
[SPEAKER_18]: Mostone.

741
01:21:49,876 --> 01:21:50,976
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion has been moved.

742
01:21:51,016 --> 01:21:52,317
[SPEAKER_18]: Roll call vote's been requested.

743
01:21:53,187 --> 01:21:53,367
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

744
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:53,909
[SPEAKER_19]: Cuno.

745
01:21:54,009 --> 01:21:54,330
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

746
01:21:55,853 --> 01:21:56,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Benedetto.

747
01:21:56,655 --> 01:21:57,016
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

748
01:21:57,257 --> 01:21:57,397
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

749
01:21:57,437 --> 01:21:57,698
[SPEAKER_19]: Kress.

750
01:21:57,738 --> 01:21:57,998
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

751
01:21:59,462 --> 01:21:59,602
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

752
01:21:59,642 --> 01:22:00,264
[SPEAKER_19]: Mostoma.

753
01:22:00,324 --> 01:22:00,544
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

754
01:22:00,785 --> 01:22:01,286
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Skerry.

755
01:22:01,306 --> 01:22:01,507
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

756
01:22:01,607 --> 01:22:01,767
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

757
01:22:01,787 --> 01:22:02,269
[SPEAKER_19]: Van Der Poel.

758
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:02,589
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

759
01:22:04,183 --> 01:22:06,364
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

760
01:22:06,484 --> 01:22:07,265
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes.

761
01:22:08,145 --> 01:22:11,827
[SPEAKER_18]: The second item, which is, I've already called the Committee of the Whole June 2nd, 2016.

762
01:22:12,267 --> 01:22:16,689
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a motion on the floor that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting on June 2nd, 2016?

763
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:17,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

764
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:22,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

765
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:24,112
[SPEAKER_18]: DiBenedetto, who made the offering.

766
01:22:25,313 --> 01:22:25,773
[SPEAKER_18]: Roll call.

767
01:22:27,253 --> 01:22:27,353
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

768
01:22:27,373 --> 01:22:27,634
[SPEAKER_19]: Scugno.

769
01:22:27,674 --> 01:22:27,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

770
01:22:27,834 --> 01:22:28,914
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

771
01:22:28,954 --> 01:22:29,494
[SPEAKER_19]: Benedetto.

772
01:22:29,574 --> 01:22:29,815
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

773
01:22:29,835 --> 01:22:30,095
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

774
01:22:30,135 --> 01:22:30,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Kretz.

775
01:22:30,475 --> 01:22:30,595
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

776
01:22:31,316 --> 01:22:35,499
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that there are many factors to a succession plan.

777
01:22:55,663 --> 01:23:02,791
[SPEAKER_13]: I am afraid that by saying, oh, we're going to have the whole thing done and created by June 30th is inappropriate.

778
01:23:03,371 --> 01:23:10,259
[SPEAKER_13]: The piece that we need to do is we need to let the superintendent know, after he lets us know what he wants,

779
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:13,061
[SPEAKER_13]: what our intent is with his contract.

780
01:23:13,482 --> 01:23:24,713
[SPEAKER_13]: But there are many, many pieces, and to just define it by June 30th, when you know how many meetings, I mean, some of you have yet to go through a budget meeting and what other meetings we might have in the end of the school year business.

781
01:23:25,573 --> 01:23:30,298
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no problem meeting during the summer and working on a succession plan if we need be.

782
01:23:30,899 --> 01:23:34,722
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no issue with that to tie us into a June 30th meeting.

783
01:23:37,564 --> 01:23:55,391
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I think it would be more appropriate is to inform the superintendent upon our intent and then subsequently, I mean, to make, to create and affirm a succession plan.

784
01:23:55,671 --> 01:23:58,432
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have to tell you, I mean, there's many pieces to a succession plan.

785
01:23:59,405 --> 01:24:01,826
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's going to be many, many parts of this.

786
01:24:01,846 --> 01:24:03,206
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm a little concerned about that.

787
01:24:03,387 --> 01:24:03,947
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolute.

788
01:24:04,387 --> 01:24:06,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we're going to have the succession plan by June 30th.

789
01:24:06,348 --> 01:24:08,328
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm offering an amendment.

790
01:24:09,629 --> 01:24:12,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, yes.

791
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:16,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, so that the, uh, could you just say how it read right now?

792
01:24:16,171 --> 01:24:22,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Original was that a succession plan be created by June 30th, 2016 point of information.

793
01:24:22,114 --> 01:24:25,655
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto, please succession plan slash process.

794
01:24:26,307 --> 01:24:32,591
[SPEAKER_16]: So even if we come up with the succession plan process by June 30th and we start a committee.

795
01:24:32,851 --> 01:24:34,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't we say process rather than succession?

796
01:24:34,972 --> 01:24:35,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

797
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:45,659
[SPEAKER_16]: And another point of information, um, through you to my colleague, um, the superintendent isn't required to tell us if his intentions until September 1st.

798
01:24:45,779 --> 01:24:45,959
[SPEAKER_16]: So.

799
01:24:46,435 --> 01:24:51,879
[SPEAKER_16]: We might not know his intention by the time, that's how it's worded in this contract.

800
01:24:51,999 --> 01:24:56,662
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's awkward and awful, but that's how the contract is worded if I'm not mistaken.

801
01:24:56,682 --> 01:24:58,844
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't think I am.

802
01:24:59,904 --> 01:25:00,085
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

803
01:25:00,165 --> 01:25:11,052
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why the word saying a process would be more appropriate because it gives us then the leeway of understanding the superintendent's role in informing us at a later date.

804
01:25:11,693 --> 01:25:15,095
[SPEAKER_13]: However, there is certainly no harm in us having discussions about

805
01:25:15,969 --> 01:25:16,750
[SPEAKER_13]: all the different things.

806
01:25:16,790 --> 01:25:18,591
[SPEAKER_13]: And by the way, just one thing I do want to add.

807
01:25:19,191 --> 01:25:23,114
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, someone brought up their concern, and I absolutely understand.

808
01:25:23,134 --> 01:25:25,756
[SPEAKER_13]: What if something happened to the superintendent?

809
01:25:26,216 --> 01:25:37,443
[SPEAKER_13]: And for years and years and years, the biggest criticism I had of the superintendent, we used to say, delegate, you have to delegate, you have to delegate, because he seemed to be the guy who knew everything.

810
01:25:37,903 --> 01:25:44,668
[SPEAKER_13]: But one of the things, he's been very successful, and I have to say that he really, you know, he really listened to us,

811
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:48,266
[SPEAKER_13]: He also speaks a lot shorter than he used to, too.

812
01:25:48,546 --> 01:25:52,388
[SPEAKER_13]: But the thing that he does now is he is delegated.

813
01:25:52,489 --> 01:26:02,274
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I know that, God forbid, something happened to the superintendent, that he has so many strong administrative people working for him and our principals and whatever.

814
01:26:02,614 --> 01:26:10,118
[SPEAKER_13]: It is not, I mean, I hope you understand in my saying this, Roy, that if he all of a sudden had a terrible accident that we would be left.

815
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:12,179
[SPEAKER_13]: without leadership.

816
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:13,720
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not the way it is.

817
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:19,163
[SPEAKER_13]: We have very strong leaders across the board, so many talented individuals.

818
01:26:19,583 --> 01:26:31,970
[SPEAKER_13]: And believe me, that has been one of the things that, as I've watched the process over the years, has really changed, that I feel confident that we would not all of a sudden be rudderless in a storm.

819
01:26:34,151 --> 01:26:38,254
[SPEAKER_18]: So the motion has been changed by the author of the motion, Mr. Benedetto.

820
01:26:38,274 --> 01:26:40,075
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to change it

821
01:26:42,721 --> 01:26:54,726
[SPEAKER_16]: to say a secession plan outline process would be completed by June 30, 2016 or developed by then.

822
01:26:56,047 --> 01:26:58,828
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm assuming that it's a working document.

823
01:26:59,408 --> 01:27:01,869
[SPEAKER_16]: I work a lot with IEPs and it's a working document.

824
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:05,571
[SPEAKER_16]: You come and revisit it many times and make changes and add to it.

825
01:27:06,502 --> 01:27:07,983
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's how I look at this process.

826
01:27:08,063 --> 01:27:10,603
[SPEAKER_18]: Once a plan is established, you make changes over time.

827
01:27:10,703 --> 01:27:10,923
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

828
01:27:11,203 --> 01:27:14,764
[SPEAKER_18]: The plan itself, if you have a deadline, it's a deadline.

829
01:27:15,345 --> 01:27:23,667
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we need to begin the process, so the process and the outline for a succession plan be started by June 30th.

830
01:27:23,687 --> 01:27:24,687
[SPEAKER_18]: Started by June 30th, okay.

831
01:27:24,947 --> 01:27:26,888
[SPEAKER_18]: That's more reasonable.

832
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:27,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep, that's more reasonable.

833
01:27:28,448 --> 01:27:28,608
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

834
01:27:28,628 --> 01:27:28,968
[SPEAKER_18]: Cuneo.

835
01:27:29,268 --> 01:27:29,989
[SPEAKER_18]: No, that was it.

836
01:27:33,395 --> 01:27:39,838
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion that a succession plan process be started prior to June 30, 2016.

837
01:27:40,658 --> 01:27:41,018
[SPEAKER_18]: Excuse me?

838
01:27:41,179 --> 01:27:41,959
[SPEAKER_23]: Prior or by?

839
01:27:42,739 --> 01:27:43,520
[SPEAKER_18]: Started by.

840
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:46,501
[SPEAKER_18]: We're picking on words now.

841
01:27:46,941 --> 01:27:48,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Started by June 30, 2016.

842
01:27:48,442 --> 01:27:52,504
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a second by Ms.

843
01:27:52,524 --> 01:27:53,084
[SPEAKER_18]: Van de Kloot?

844
01:27:53,444 --> 01:27:54,505
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Skerry, call the roll.

845
01:27:54,525 --> 01:27:54,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

846
01:27:54,905 --> 01:27:55,265
[SPEAKER_19]: Cooney.

847
01:27:55,365 --> 01:27:56,185
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

848
01:27:56,245 --> 01:27:56,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Vandetta.

849
01:27:56,886 --> 01:27:57,066
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

850
01:27:57,126 --> 01:27:57,186
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

851
01:27:57,206 --> 01:27:57,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Stratz.

852
01:27:57,506 --> 01:27:57,566
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

853
01:27:59,187 --> 01:27:59,307
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

854
01:27:59,327 --> 01:27:59,527
[SPEAKER_19]: Postone.

855
01:27:59,547 --> 01:27:59,627
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

856
01:28:03,512 --> 01:28:05,313
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

857
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:06,233
[SPEAKER_18]: The motion passes.

858
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:07,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

859
01:28:07,313 --> 01:28:09,254
[SPEAKER_18]: There's others that would like to speak on this topic.

860
01:28:09,674 --> 01:28:10,655
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

861
01:28:11,135 --> 01:28:12,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Jean Martin, 10 coming street.

862
01:28:12,355 --> 01:28:14,236
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for having me and letting me speak tonight.

863
01:28:14,936 --> 01:28:26,361
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I'm going to ask you guys first to, to not be defensive, you know, um, and it's, it's hard not to get defensive because you feel like you're being undermined and you know, your authority is being undermined.

864
01:28:27,061 --> 01:28:27,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

865
01:28:29,535 --> 01:28:37,202
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an overarching concept that with the new mayor, the old mayor did things very, very differently and things were around for a long time.

866
01:28:37,802 --> 01:28:39,724
[SPEAKER_11]: And people just went on automatic pilot.

867
01:28:40,252 --> 01:28:45,435
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the first time that questions are being asked of leadership.

868
01:28:45,895 --> 01:28:50,077
[SPEAKER_11]: And with Mayor Burke, they're actually not getting pushed under the rug.

869
01:28:50,657 --> 01:28:51,337
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a good thing.

870
01:28:52,158 --> 01:28:58,341
[SPEAKER_11]: So the dialogue between the council and the mayor needs to improve, as I pointed out to her.

871
01:28:58,861 --> 01:29:04,584
[SPEAKER_11]: And the people need to dialogue with the school committee more.

872
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:09,126
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's nothing wrong with challenging the leadership, challenging authority.

873
01:29:09,466 --> 01:29:12,727
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing wrong with asking questions, and I thank her for asking that question.

874
01:29:13,928 --> 01:29:21,230
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the reasons why it got overlapped is because the people weren't feeling that they weren't getting their answers from this body.

875
01:29:21,870 --> 01:29:29,993
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why they went to the council, and that's why I pointed out they're calling the counselors, because they don't feel that their needs are being heard here.

876
01:29:30,748 --> 01:29:32,209
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a breakdown in communication.

877
01:29:32,629 --> 01:29:33,589
[SPEAKER_11]: So that needs to be said.

878
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:37,531
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to say that whether he stays or goes, it doesn't matter.

879
01:29:37,551 --> 01:29:39,432
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have children in the school system, no offense.

880
01:29:39,892 --> 01:29:43,213
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do know that you've been around long enough not to take anything I say personally.

881
01:29:43,474 --> 01:29:44,074
[SPEAKER_11]: I do know that.

882
01:29:46,115 --> 01:29:46,895
[SPEAKER_11]: He knows me too well.

883
01:29:47,315 --> 01:29:51,037
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway, I just want the process to happen.

884
01:29:51,057 --> 01:29:52,217
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same thing with the charter review.

885
01:29:52,257 --> 01:29:52,798
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the same thing.

886
01:29:53,058 --> 01:29:53,998
[SPEAKER_11]: And there is overlap.

887
01:29:54,018 --> 01:29:58,260
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have children in the school systems, but I do have a tenant who has a daughter in the school systems.

888
01:29:59,142 --> 01:30:01,663
[SPEAKER_11]: So you're always around kids, and kids are always everywhere.

889
01:30:01,923 --> 01:30:02,663
[SPEAKER_11]: They're always everywhere.

890
01:30:03,043 --> 01:30:07,664
[SPEAKER_11]: And so a kid in the school system is my kid in an extended version.

891
01:30:09,265 --> 01:30:11,666
[SPEAKER_11]: But what was I going to say?

892
01:30:13,186 --> 01:30:14,626
[SPEAKER_11]: I did, I don't know.

893
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:19,488
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think that more communication and more openness, it's not a bad thing.

894
01:30:19,948 --> 01:30:21,288
[SPEAKER_11]: The new mayor has a new start.

895
01:30:21,848 --> 01:30:24,349
[SPEAKER_11]: She's got a long way to go, a long way to go.

896
01:30:25,111 --> 01:30:28,032
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not bad to review.

897
01:30:28,072 --> 01:30:28,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and the overlap.

898
01:30:29,873 --> 01:30:33,374
[SPEAKER_11]: If you have the TV3, and I don't agree with having it up at the high school, you all know that.

899
01:30:33,674 --> 01:30:37,396
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you do, I'm a person, I'm a citizen, I'm now going to be in that public building.

900
01:30:37,416 --> 01:30:39,137
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to be in the school system.

901
01:30:39,697 --> 01:30:45,039
[SPEAKER_11]: There is overlap between, even if you don't have kids in the system, there's an overlap between the schools.

902
01:30:45,545 --> 01:30:46,405
[SPEAKER_11]: and the city council.

903
01:30:46,845 --> 01:30:47,946
[SPEAKER_11]: And that, oh, go ahead.

904
01:30:47,966 --> 01:30:49,506
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say, Jean, you're a taxpayer.

905
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:50,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that's right.

906
01:30:51,007 --> 01:30:51,307
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.

907
01:30:51,387 --> 01:30:54,768
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you're a taxpayer, so you don't have to keep on saying, I don't have kids in the system.

908
01:30:55,028 --> 01:30:55,888
[SPEAKER_13]: You are a taxpayer.

909
01:30:55,908 --> 01:30:57,029
[SPEAKER_13]: You are a citizen of Medford.

910
01:30:57,069 --> 01:31:03,871
[SPEAKER_13]: You have every right to be concerned about the schools in our community as any other person, any parent, or whatever.

911
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:04,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thank you.

912
01:31:04,491 --> 01:31:04,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

913
01:31:05,151 --> 01:31:06,312
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to say that

914
01:31:07,897 --> 01:31:09,459
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing wrong with asking the question.

915
01:31:09,739 --> 01:31:12,182
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that every five years, somebody should be judging you.

916
01:31:12,382 --> 01:31:12,782
[SPEAKER_11]: No offense.

917
01:31:12,802 --> 01:31:13,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Every year.

918
01:31:13,383 --> 01:31:13,844
[SPEAKER_18]: Every year?

919
01:31:14,284 --> 01:31:15,405
[SPEAKER_18]: Every year he's reviewed.

920
01:31:15,425 --> 01:31:17,528
[SPEAKER_11]: But it should come from some higher authority and not yourself.

921
01:31:17,548 --> 01:31:18,669
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we are the higher authority.

922
01:31:18,729 --> 01:31:19,370
[SPEAKER_18]: We hire him.

923
01:31:19,550 --> 01:31:20,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, you hire him.

924
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:20,371
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

925
01:31:20,611 --> 01:31:20,891
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

926
01:31:20,931 --> 01:31:21,272
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

927
01:31:21,292 --> 01:31:22,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, but he's evaluating himself.

928
01:31:22,533 --> 01:31:23,094
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't get it.

929
01:31:23,114 --> 01:31:23,374
[SPEAKER_11]: He should.

930
01:31:23,674 --> 01:31:25,136
[SPEAKER_11]: He submits it to the body.

931
01:31:27,258 --> 01:31:27,418
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

932
01:31:27,498 --> 01:31:27,759
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

933
01:31:28,099 --> 01:31:28,379
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

934
01:31:29,995 --> 01:31:32,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, that needs to happen, and it needs to be.

935
01:31:32,457 --> 01:31:33,758
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm all for having it open.

936
01:31:34,178 --> 01:31:38,701
[SPEAKER_11]: The Charter Review, I'm all for open government, and I want to thank everybody for the transparency.

937
01:31:38,721 --> 01:31:40,022
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a new day is dawning.

938
01:31:40,563 --> 01:31:41,884
[SPEAKER_11]: You got a job in front of you.

939
01:31:42,024 --> 01:31:43,285
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't envy you.

940
01:31:44,005 --> 01:31:45,766
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll see you guys later.

941
01:31:45,786 --> 01:31:45,987
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

942
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:46,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

943
01:31:46,707 --> 01:31:47,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Martin.

944
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:50,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

945
01:31:50,570 --> 01:31:50,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuno?

946
01:31:51,290 --> 01:31:53,132
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to address what Gene said.

947
01:31:54,149 --> 01:31:55,249
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make it very clear.

948
01:31:55,269 --> 01:31:56,650
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not trying to be defensive.

949
01:31:57,270 --> 01:32:02,631
[SPEAKER_14]: I just get very frustrated between facts being thrown out and non-factual stuff being thrown out.

950
01:32:03,211 --> 01:32:05,551
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I've gone to City Council.

951
01:32:05,591 --> 01:32:08,992
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're going to be speaking about City Council, I've gone to City Council many, many times.

952
01:32:09,532 --> 01:32:13,593
[SPEAKER_14]: And I try to get my information not only from City Council, but also from parents.

953
01:32:14,013 --> 01:32:16,814
[SPEAKER_14]: When there's two stories out there, you always have to listen to both.

954
01:32:17,414 --> 01:32:23,175
[SPEAKER_14]: And it got frustrating to me as a school committee member because we haven't had the opportunity yet

955
01:32:23,935 --> 01:32:26,778
[SPEAKER_14]: until tonight to really speak about what is going on.

956
01:32:27,299 --> 01:32:37,609
[SPEAKER_14]: So for that, I apologize if I come across being defensive, but I get very upset and very passionate when I know there's certain things that are not true and certain things that are.

957
01:32:38,150 --> 01:32:42,835
[SPEAKER_14]: And as far as debating and coming and asking questions, that's why we're here.

958
01:32:43,215 --> 01:32:44,096
[SPEAKER_14]: We're not here for us.

959
01:32:44,457 --> 01:32:45,458
[SPEAKER_14]: We're here for everybody else.

960
01:32:47,319 --> 01:32:47,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

961
01:32:47,499 --> 01:32:49,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Vander Kloof?

962
01:32:49,321 --> 01:32:49,481
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

963
01:32:49,962 --> 01:32:50,662
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Benedetto.

964
01:32:51,503 --> 01:32:51,863
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

965
01:32:52,043 --> 01:32:52,504
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

966
01:32:53,044 --> 01:32:54,045
[SPEAKER_16]: One, one, I'm sorry.

967
01:32:54,145 --> 01:32:54,866
[SPEAKER_16]: One more quick thing.

968
01:32:55,327 --> 01:33:09,600
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I know this item, a few items have been on the city council agenda and some of our colleagues have moved over to city council and I just feel like we're working together because they have to approve the ultimate bar budget as well.

969
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:16,004
[SPEAKER_16]: So I believe that the school committee and the city council working together only benefits our community.

970
01:33:16,325 --> 01:33:22,609
[SPEAKER_16]: And I look forward to doing that with them in a much more open, direct way.

971
01:33:23,049 --> 01:33:35,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I feel like any kind, instead of it being them and us, I want it to be us working together as elected officials to represent all the voters and all the people coming forward.

972
01:33:35,458 --> 01:33:37,439
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to say that straight out.

973
01:33:37,659 --> 01:33:42,422
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm glad that our items are on their agenda and someday maybe some of theirs might be on us.

974
01:33:42,603 --> 01:33:45,064
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely, because they're in charge of the budget.

975
01:33:45,324 --> 01:33:46,425
[SPEAKER_11]: So I totally agree with that.

976
01:33:47,345 --> 01:33:53,569
[SPEAKER_11]: But I want to just say, instead of just one-on-one and cherry-picking, you know, that it needs to be body-to-body.

977
01:33:53,609 --> 01:33:59,533
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to have the whole body of the city council sit down with the whole body of the school committee and maybe under new leadership we can do that.

978
01:34:00,193 --> 01:34:01,614
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're doing the right thing, you will do that.

979
01:34:01,954 --> 01:34:02,595
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

980
01:34:05,768 --> 01:34:06,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, your name, please.

981
01:34:07,349 --> 01:34:08,369
[SPEAKER_24]: My name is Bob Candy.

982
01:34:08,990 --> 01:34:11,091
[SPEAKER_17]: And Monique DeVos, Grand Ave.

983
01:34:11,831 --> 01:34:14,372
[SPEAKER_24]: Monique and I have three children in the system.

984
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:20,556
[SPEAKER_24]: Abby is now actually at Mount Holyoke, so I shouldn't say we've had three children in the system.

985
01:34:22,296 --> 01:34:24,418
[SPEAKER_24]: She prospered in the Medford schools.

986
01:34:25,598 --> 01:34:33,362
[SPEAKER_24]: Ben is number one in his class this year and doing very well, taking advantage of AP courses.

987
01:34:34,123 --> 01:34:34,943
[SPEAKER_24]: Things are going great.

988
01:34:37,042 --> 01:34:44,224
[SPEAKER_24]: and Jane is prospering as well as a freshman, we're not here tonight to talk about Mr. Belson.

989
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:49,507
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't know why this has been conflated with Mr. Belson.

990
01:34:50,807 --> 01:35:01,411
[SPEAKER_24]: This is not, when you talk about a time for a process, and by the way, I appreciate your motion, or some of the comments that have been made, it makes no sense to us.

991
01:35:01,872 --> 01:35:05,033
[SPEAKER_24]: With all due respect, I don't mean this the wrong way, it could be Mickey Mouse up there.

992
01:35:06,007 --> 01:35:07,187
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't matter.

993
01:35:07,527 --> 01:35:09,428
[SPEAKER_24]: A succession plan is a plan.

994
01:35:10,008 --> 01:35:12,189
[SPEAKER_24]: It's irrespective of who's in place.

995
01:35:13,669 --> 01:35:20,071
[SPEAKER_24]: Whether Mr. Belson decides he wants to renew, retire, God forbid he's ill, doesn't matter.

996
01:35:20,952 --> 01:35:25,453
[SPEAKER_24]: And what hasn't been done, at least as far as Monique and I can tell, is you don't have a plan.

997
01:35:26,613 --> 01:35:29,674
[SPEAKER_24]: And it's not dependent on what Mr. Belson decides to do.

998
01:35:29,874 --> 01:35:31,175
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just good common sense.

999
01:35:32,355 --> 01:35:35,096
[SPEAKER_24]: I've checked other school districts before we got here.

1000
01:35:36,657 --> 01:35:38,958
[SPEAKER_24]: You'd be amazed how many school districts have a plan.

1001
01:35:39,858 --> 01:35:45,220
[SPEAKER_24]: Indeed, there's a quote from one of them that says, the lack of a plan is no plan at all.

1002
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:53,502
[SPEAKER_24]: So with that said, this is not a referendum on the elephant in the room, I think, as you put it, Ms.

1003
01:35:53,522 --> 01:35:54,102
[SPEAKER_24]: Vander Kloot.

1004
01:35:54,662 --> 01:36:03,205
[SPEAKER_24]: Whether Mr. Belson goes, stays, how well he's done, it's a separate issue to be determined by the school committee, by the parents,

1005
01:36:04,462 --> 01:36:07,824
[SPEAKER_24]: all concerned, we want to talk about the succession plan.

1006
01:36:09,886 --> 01:36:14,409
[SPEAKER_24]: In the corporate world, the schools would be the public company.

1007
01:36:15,450 --> 01:36:17,911
[SPEAKER_24]: The taxpayers would be your investors.

1008
01:36:18,192 --> 01:36:20,893
[SPEAKER_24]: Stop me if this analogy isn't working for you.

1009
01:36:22,675 --> 01:36:28,439
[SPEAKER_24]: The shareholders are the Medford taxpayers who want to see a return on their investment.

1010
01:36:29,339 --> 01:36:31,081
[SPEAKER_24]: Many of us are parents here of children.

1011
01:36:31,241 --> 01:36:33,062
[SPEAKER_24]: We want to see them achieve their potential.

1012
01:36:34,055 --> 01:36:37,697
[SPEAKER_24]: And we want the schools to continue to improve their accountability results.

1013
01:36:39,118 --> 01:36:42,300
[SPEAKER_24]: The school committee is the company's board of directors.

1014
01:36:43,561 --> 01:36:50,365
[SPEAKER_24]: And in the corporate world, they're charged with ensuring responsible governance and the ongoing continuity of the company.

1015
01:36:51,426 --> 01:37:00,612
[SPEAKER_24]: If a company that was public did not have a succession plan, they would be guilty of malfeasance and could be charged by their shareholders and by the government.

1016
01:37:01,605 --> 01:37:04,886
[SPEAKER_24]: with failing to adhere to several statutes that I can think of.

1017
01:37:06,466 --> 01:37:12,327
[SPEAKER_24]: So why this is such a matter of contention, we don't get this.

1018
01:37:12,707 --> 01:37:15,948
[SPEAKER_24]: Whether you were defensive or not, I know it's difficult, Ms.

1019
01:37:15,968 --> 01:37:17,108
[SPEAKER_24]: Cunha, to sit and listen.

1020
01:37:18,609 --> 01:37:20,709
[SPEAKER_24]: Our sons run track together.

1021
01:37:20,769 --> 01:37:24,190
[SPEAKER_24]: We appreciate everything that you do, all of you, day in and day out.

1022
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:25,730
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not about this.

1023
01:37:26,490 --> 01:37:29,811
[SPEAKER_24]: So hearing this is really troubling.

1024
01:37:30,462 --> 01:37:31,883
[SPEAKER_24]: you're either going to do the right thing.

1025
01:37:32,603 --> 01:37:35,285
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm sorry if you don't like that phrase, or you're not.

1026
01:37:38,607 --> 01:37:44,650
[SPEAKER_24]: So the board is also responsible for ensuring the school committee the performance of the CEO.

1027
01:37:46,231 --> 01:37:48,612
[SPEAKER_24]: And in this analogy, obviously, that's Mr. Belson.

1028
01:37:50,233 --> 01:37:53,515
[SPEAKER_24]: Him meeting the standards that you define and that he defines for himself.

1029
01:37:53,575 --> 01:37:57,497
[SPEAKER_24]: He's not going to, I'm sure, define standards he doesn't think he should be meeting.

1030
01:37:58,531 --> 01:38:02,294
[SPEAKER_24]: And finding out if he doesn't do that, as someone pointed out, holding him accountable.

1031
01:38:03,435 --> 01:38:04,756
[SPEAKER_24]: It shouldn't matter who is at the helm.

1032
01:38:05,737 --> 01:38:23,311
[SPEAKER_24]: So the goal of the shareholders, the parents, the community at large, is it fair to ask if you folks really feel that you know, as your shareholders, what the parents and the community at large really want from the district?

1033
01:38:23,792 --> 01:38:26,014
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you feel you truly understand that?

1034
01:38:26,414 --> 01:38:27,595
[SPEAKER_24]: Have you done any surveys?

1035
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:31,032
[SPEAKER_24]: I know you talk to parents all the time, God knows.

1036
01:38:31,933 --> 01:38:37,237
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, Paulette, she's everywhere and does a great job, and I know the rest of you do, too.

1037
01:38:37,357 --> 01:38:38,377
[SPEAKER_24]: But do you know that?

1038
01:38:38,498 --> 01:38:39,538
[SPEAKER_24]: Have you actually polled them?

1039
01:38:39,578 --> 01:38:46,384
[SPEAKER_24]: Have you spoken with them in a matter that you could publish and say, you know what, the majority of people seem to want A, B, C, D?

1040
01:38:47,965 --> 01:38:50,567
[SPEAKER_24]: Because the succession plan is supposed to have that, by the way.

1041
01:38:50,607 --> 01:38:54,209
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not just supposed to be about replacing Mr. Belson should he leave or go.

1042
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:56,031
[SPEAKER_24]: It's supposed to be about

1043
01:38:56,544 --> 01:39:05,929
[SPEAKER_24]: We need a plan to achieve X with a person who's going to hold this job, who's capable of doing A, B, C, D, E, except the A through E ain't there.

1044
01:39:05,949 --> 01:39:09,631
[SPEAKER_24]: At least not as far as we know.

1045
01:39:11,012 --> 01:39:14,414
[SPEAKER_24]: So what about the goals of the teachers and the other staff?

1046
01:39:14,494 --> 01:39:19,696
[SPEAKER_24]: I see them all here tonight, and I'm really glad they're expressing support for Mr. Belson, but again, this isn't about him.

1047
01:39:20,897 --> 01:39:26,280
[SPEAKER_24]: This is about governance, simple governance.

1048
01:39:27,459 --> 01:39:29,100
[SPEAKER_24]: What about the goals of the administration?

1049
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:30,120
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Belson's right.

1050
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:34,743
[SPEAKER_24]: He has a perfect right to define what we should be doing as a school system.

1051
01:39:35,723 --> 01:39:37,244
[SPEAKER_24]: And that should be for Ms.

1052
01:39:37,284 --> 01:39:38,084
[SPEAKER_24]: Caldwell and Ms.

1053
01:39:38,124 --> 01:39:39,305
[SPEAKER_24]: Nelson and the principals.

1054
01:39:40,565 --> 01:39:41,586
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's not in a plan.

1055
01:39:42,846 --> 01:39:43,647
[SPEAKER_24]: Not that we know of.

1056
01:39:43,727 --> 01:39:44,787
[SPEAKER_24]: Not a succession plan.

1057
01:39:46,128 --> 01:39:50,890
[SPEAKER_24]: And it should be based on all of the above and you should have a recruiting plan for it regardless of why.

1058
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:52,651
[SPEAKER_24]: It should be there.

1059
01:39:53,011 --> 01:39:56,373
[SPEAKER_24]: You should know, Mr. Belson said, some take longer, some don't.

1060
01:39:58,337 --> 01:39:59,497
[SPEAKER_24]: Just have the plan.

1061
01:40:00,818 --> 01:40:06,340
[SPEAKER_24]: So telling me that there's good superintendents, I know that.

1062
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:07,260
[SPEAKER_24]: We work with Ms.

1063
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:08,361
[SPEAKER_24]: Caldwell in particular.

1064
01:40:08,561 --> 01:40:09,201
[SPEAKER_24]: She's excellent.

1065
01:40:09,901 --> 01:40:15,624
[SPEAKER_24]: But that said, knowing that you have people in place, that's a contingency.

1066
01:40:15,824 --> 01:40:16,804
[SPEAKER_24]: That's not a plan.

1067
01:40:18,485 --> 01:40:18,945
[SPEAKER_24]: Am I wrong?

1068
01:40:22,206 --> 01:40:22,406
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

1069
01:40:23,027 --> 01:40:24,587
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to know I was in office.

1070
01:40:24,647 --> 01:40:26,048
[SPEAKER_24]: My wife tells me in outer space.

1071
01:40:29,785 --> 01:40:30,025
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

1072
01:40:30,646 --> 01:40:33,487
[SPEAKER_24]: So look, Monique and I really appreciate you listening to us.

1073
01:40:33,627 --> 01:40:35,729
[SPEAKER_24]: We're already going in the step in the right direction.

1074
01:40:36,649 --> 01:40:41,252
[SPEAKER_24]: So the dates kind of don't matter to us, but the good plan really does.

1075
01:40:41,772 --> 01:40:47,516
[SPEAKER_24]: We would ask you to find a mechanism to survey the parents and the community at large.

1076
01:40:48,096 --> 01:40:53,880
[SPEAKER_24]: It's unfortunate we don't get as many people as we could, but you and I both know, not a lot of people show up.

1077
01:40:54,398 --> 01:41:01,564
[SPEAKER_24]: Same people to the PTO, same people to the meetings, but there's a lot of good-hearted parents out there who give you information if you ask for it.

1078
01:41:02,445 --> 01:41:09,191
[SPEAKER_24]: So, Monique, I don't know if you have anything you want to add, but it's unusual.

1079
01:41:09,992 --> 01:41:11,453
[SPEAKER_24]: We thank you for listening to us.

1080
01:41:11,473 --> 01:41:12,614
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you have any questions of us?

1081
01:41:14,747 --> 01:41:14,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1082
01:41:14,947 --> 01:41:15,467
[SPEAKER_13]: Van de Kloot?

1083
01:41:16,067 --> 01:41:39,016
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Bob, one thing I just want to mention to you is that our thinking actually isn't that far apart, because recently I attended the National School Board Conference, and I said to Anne Marie, who was with me at the time, come on, come on, we have to go down and talk to these people, because the topic was how to successfully survey your school population so it's meaningful.

1084
01:41:39,796 --> 01:41:43,217
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's very much been part of my thinking of sort of saying that it is time

1085
01:41:43,650 --> 01:41:45,871
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe, to reach out and to send a survey.

1086
01:41:45,911 --> 01:41:50,334
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, surveys can be useless and they can be powerful.

1087
01:41:50,814 --> 01:41:54,917
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's, so that was my thinking about that.

1088
01:41:55,177 --> 01:42:00,680
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to mention to you also that we do establish goals every fall.

1089
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:02,541
[SPEAKER_13]: We talk about them publicly.

1090
01:42:02,601 --> 01:42:04,302
[SPEAKER_13]: We argue about them.

1091
01:42:04,422 --> 01:42:06,263
[SPEAKER_13]: And those are our guiding lights.

1092
01:42:06,763 --> 01:42:10,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, personally, I think now we're clearly at the place where we need a succession,

1093
01:42:11,807 --> 01:42:16,392
[SPEAKER_13]: to talk about this and I will just assure you that it will happen.

1094
01:42:16,532 --> 01:42:17,113
[SPEAKER_24]: Can I ask a question?

1095
01:42:17,574 --> 01:42:17,834
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1096
01:42:17,994 --> 01:42:19,496
[SPEAKER_24]: Do parents have to live to your goals?

1097
01:42:20,577 --> 01:42:21,518
[SPEAKER_13]: I certainly think they should.

1098
01:42:21,918 --> 01:42:22,259
[SPEAKER_24]: Do they?

1099
01:42:24,257 --> 01:42:25,077
[SPEAKER_24]: Do they have input?

1100
01:42:25,478 --> 01:42:28,038
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Bob, you know, every year we do it.

1101
01:42:28,338 --> 01:42:30,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Every year, you know, we have three people in the audience.

1102
01:42:31,259 --> 01:42:40,682
[SPEAKER_24]: So let me suggest, knowing that, because we both know that that's the case, that what you just did, going to find out what that is, find a better mechanism.

1103
01:42:41,282 --> 01:42:42,822
[SPEAKER_24]: Don't rely upon people to show up.

1104
01:42:42,842 --> 01:42:43,723
[SPEAKER_24]: You know they're not going to do it.

1105
01:42:44,763 --> 01:42:48,604
[SPEAKER_24]: You guys are given all these nights and you must obviously feel very tired about it.

1106
01:42:49,028 --> 01:42:55,251
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'll bet you that if you gave people an online mechanism to respond that was anonymous, if you need help with that, let me know.

1107
01:42:56,271 --> 01:42:56,812
[SPEAKER_24]: It can be done.

1108
01:42:57,812 --> 01:42:59,273
[SPEAKER_24]: With that said, a last comment.

1109
01:42:59,953 --> 01:43:02,514
[SPEAKER_24]: Angela Moore got up here and did a very, very difficult thing.

1110
01:43:03,335 --> 01:43:06,116
[SPEAKER_24]: She did it at the school committee and she did it as a council.

1111
01:43:06,636 --> 01:43:08,597
[SPEAKER_24]: Somehow it got conflated with Mr. Bilson.

1112
01:43:09,418 --> 01:43:10,258
[SPEAKER_24]: It wasn't about that.

1113
01:43:11,266 --> 01:43:13,647
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I spoke to Angela after this was in place.

1114
01:43:15,829 --> 01:43:19,290
[SPEAKER_24]: Her goal was to make this a process that was happening.

1115
01:43:19,871 --> 01:43:27,155
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just want to commend her for coming, facing, I won't say the lion's den, but it wasn't easy.

1116
01:43:27,335 --> 01:43:36,400
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you, Angela.

1117
01:43:39,201 --> 01:43:39,322
[SPEAKER_26]: Hello.

1118
01:43:39,342 --> 01:43:40,022
[SPEAKER_26]: How are you doing?

1119
01:43:40,593 --> 01:43:41,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, can you name and address, please?

1120
01:43:41,954 --> 01:43:44,916
[SPEAKER_26]: My name is Vince Master Mateo, 10 Schoolhouse Road, Bedford, Mass.

1121
01:43:45,956 --> 01:43:46,496
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm here tonight.

1122
01:43:46,777 --> 01:43:48,918
[SPEAKER_26]: This is the first time I've been in a school committee meeting.

1123
01:43:49,078 --> 01:43:51,859
[SPEAKER_26]: I have three young kids in the school system.

1124
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:57,343
[SPEAKER_26]: And my biggest, I have a lot of things I wanted to say, but I'm probably going to hold back for most of them tonight.

1125
01:43:57,483 --> 01:44:08,389
[SPEAKER_26]: But the biggest thing that concerns me as a young parent with a lot of young kids is, and a lot of people my age that are moving out of Medford to towns like Andover or Winchester,

1126
01:44:09,175 --> 01:44:11,857
[SPEAKER_26]: is the school ranking, 70 out of 75.

1127
01:44:12,517 --> 01:44:19,882
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's one of the things during the succession thing that we're talking about, what's the game plan to make it better than 70?

1128
01:44:21,203 --> 01:44:22,023
[SPEAKER_26]: And how do we do that?

1129
01:44:22,384 --> 01:44:24,405
[SPEAKER_26]: And how can we in the community help?

1130
01:44:25,706 --> 01:44:30,589
[SPEAKER_26]: And those are the things that I think are most critical, because at the end of the day, really, that's the most important thing.

1131
01:44:30,609 --> 01:44:34,732
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1132
01:44:34,752 --> 01:44:36,333
[SPEAKER_26]: So please just take that into consideration.

1133
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:44,361
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say as far as the plan, I mean, we haven't sat down and we are going to sit down.

1134
01:44:44,481 --> 01:44:45,361
[SPEAKER_14]: You're absolutely right.

1135
01:44:47,522 --> 01:45:02,725
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that, I mean, having a superintendent search without any type of input from either community parents, teachers, administrators, or anyone from those categories, and including students,

1136
01:45:03,322 --> 01:45:05,884
[SPEAKER_14]: would be crazy for us to do.

1137
01:45:06,524 --> 01:45:21,654
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I'm only basing it on what we've done and what the superintendent has done the last few times, even when we've hired assistant principals or principals or the director of the vocational school or our director of finance, is that we have had

1138
01:45:22,127 --> 01:45:37,540
[SPEAKER_14]: That particular plan, and I'm not sure if everyone is aware of that, is that the superintendent and the assistant superintendents have gotten together, have made a list of qualified people, and once that was set, then we had

1139
01:45:38,074 --> 01:45:45,881
[SPEAKER_14]: groups of people that we never even got involved with until it went through all the groups that were on a one-to-one basis.

1140
01:45:46,362 --> 01:45:54,289
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm looking forward to the fact that that's the type of plan or part of the plan of the groups that we'd want to get.

1141
01:45:54,369 --> 01:45:56,571
[SPEAKER_14]: We definitely have to have the input of the parents.

1142
01:45:58,212 --> 01:45:59,754
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to have input of the students.

1143
01:45:59,774 --> 01:46:01,776
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to have input of our teachers.

1144
01:46:01,796 --> 01:46:03,317
[SPEAKER_14]: They're the ones that are going to be in the system.

1145
01:46:03,768 --> 01:46:14,877
[SPEAKER_14]: We're here as elected officials, we understand our position of what we have to do, but we need to collect all that data before we could really go and just make a decision of who's coming and who's going.

1146
01:46:15,317 --> 01:46:32,130
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I mean, to address your concerns about, I mean, I know that Paulette just mentioned it, but I want to reiterate the fact that there is no way that we could or will pick someone else when the time comes without the input of the people involved.

1147
01:46:32,410 --> 01:46:33,011
[SPEAKER_14]: It has to be.

1148
01:46:33,421 --> 01:46:44,527
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank you very much for that, but I was going a step before that, which was help in defining what the goals of the person you're seeking ought to be accomplishing.

1149
01:46:45,348 --> 01:46:50,410
[SPEAKER_24]: So what that means is, what are the priorities of the young parents at Bedford?

1150
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:55,473
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm an old guy at this point, but you've got people who have people in kindergarten, kids in kindergarten.

1151
01:46:56,214 --> 01:46:58,455
[SPEAKER_24]: Mia, God bless you, with six children, right?

1152
01:46:58,515 --> 01:47:02,097
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, so I'm really getting at a point of,

1153
01:47:02,662 --> 01:47:07,106
[SPEAKER_24]: Medford is changing, and it's changing for the better through the hard work of a lot of good people.

1154
01:47:08,247 --> 01:47:09,909
[SPEAKER_24]: They don't feel they have input.

1155
01:47:09,949 --> 01:47:11,090
[SPEAKER_24]: I've talked to a lot of them.

1156
01:47:11,470 --> 01:47:12,611
[SPEAKER_24]: Not because you're stopping them.

1157
01:47:12,971 --> 01:47:13,772
[SPEAKER_24]: They don't know how to do it.

1158
01:47:14,793 --> 01:47:17,896
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm asking you show them how to say, these are my priorities.

1159
01:47:17,956 --> 01:47:19,878
[SPEAKER_24]: This is what I want from the system.

1160
01:47:20,538 --> 01:47:27,925
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I know you'll take that into account, and then you go search for a person who has done that, can show he or she has done that.

1161
01:47:28,369 --> 01:47:28,729
[SPEAKER_24]: and meet it.

1162
01:47:29,009 --> 01:47:32,171
[SPEAKER_24]: To just search for a superintendent with credentials is only half the battle.

1163
01:47:32,451 --> 01:47:33,131
[SPEAKER_24]: Would you agree?

1164
01:47:33,351 --> 01:47:33,771
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're right.

1165
01:47:33,991 --> 01:47:36,573
[SPEAKER_14]: And as far as I mean, having, it's, it's unfortunate.

1166
01:47:36,633 --> 01:47:38,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

1167
01:47:40,374 --> 01:47:41,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

1168
01:47:42,335 --> 01:47:43,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mayor Burke.

1169
01:47:44,176 --> 01:47:50,259
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I just wanted to, to address the, the, the gentleman that was just at the podium.

1170
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:53,780
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I want to, I know you asked, excuse me.

1171
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:58,082
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you asked about what, um, we were doing about our,

1172
01:47:58,542 --> 01:48:15,907
[SPEAKER_16]: our level and my colleague is the head of the academic affairs committee and I requested that we hold a committee meeting so that way we could discuss our next steps because we are a level three school district and we need to have a plan in place.

1173
01:48:16,787 --> 01:48:18,828
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I know it upsets you, it upsets me too.

1174
01:48:20,371 --> 01:48:22,213
[SPEAKER_26]: We have to have a... What does level three mean?

1175
01:48:22,353 --> 01:48:25,355
[SPEAKER_16]: So when your MCAS school is in, it's like you're leveling.

1176
01:48:25,536 --> 01:48:25,676
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1177
01:48:25,696 --> 01:48:25,996
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1178
01:48:26,096 --> 01:48:28,058
[SPEAKER_16]: And it has to do with the ranking as well.

1179
01:48:28,198 --> 01:48:28,458
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1180
01:48:28,658 --> 01:48:28,939
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay?

1181
01:48:29,239 --> 01:48:41,070
[SPEAKER_16]: So we did a committee of the whole to go over ways that we can address, figure out what the exact needs are, what we need to do, and what next steps are to help us

1182
01:48:42,252 --> 01:48:51,455
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm going to stop talking now and let the committee chair speak a little bit more about it directly, because we just did this recently.

1183
01:48:51,795 --> 01:48:55,657
[SPEAKER_16]: So as a committee, we know that that's an issue and that we are bringing that forward.

1184
01:48:55,677 --> 01:48:58,698
[SPEAKER_26]: The biggest thing is, again, for someone like me, I have three kids.

1185
01:48:59,378 --> 01:49:03,019
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd rather not have to spend $100,000 a kid for high school.

1186
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:07,481
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd rather just use my tax dollars and make Medford a better school.

1187
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:10,381
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's one of the reasons I'm here tonight.

1188
01:49:10,641 --> 01:49:12,001
[SPEAKER_26]: I do want to make Medford better.

1189
01:49:12,621 --> 01:49:14,642
[SPEAKER_26]: And I know a lot of younger parents do as well.

1190
01:49:14,762 --> 01:49:21,383
[SPEAKER_26]: But like in business, when you're ranked 70th out of 75, heads roll.

1191
01:49:21,403 --> 01:49:23,204
[SPEAKER_26]: And people need to be accountable.

1192
01:49:23,544 --> 01:49:25,665
[SPEAKER_26]: And this is the kind of time to do that.

1193
01:49:25,805 --> 01:49:30,746
[SPEAKER_26]: And I get caught on the carpet in my work all the time when my rankings aren't where they need to be.

1194
01:49:31,862 --> 01:49:36,766
[SPEAKER_13]: So, as my colleague said, we had a meeting about a curriculum subcommittee meeting.

1195
01:49:36,926 --> 01:49:48,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I need to clarify something, and part of the problem is this is very, very complex, and if you just go on and you just look at a ranking, it will totally lead you in ways that are not correct.

1196
01:49:48,856 --> 01:49:51,659
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, my colleague mentioned we're level three.

1197
01:49:52,279 --> 01:49:55,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we have one school which is in level three.

1198
01:49:55,441 --> 01:49:57,382
[SPEAKER_13]: We were one point away from being level two.

1199
01:49:57,442 --> 01:50:02,226
[SPEAKER_13]: They can't tell us what we did wrong so that we get level two, but that's part of the complexity of it all.

1200
01:50:02,366 --> 01:50:02,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1201
01:50:02,666 --> 01:50:02,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1202
01:50:03,206 --> 01:50:06,208
[SPEAKER_13]: We are a level one high school and have been so for years.

1203
01:50:06,949 --> 01:50:07,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1204
01:50:07,569 --> 01:50:09,651
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're doing awfully good somehow or another.

1205
01:50:10,051 --> 01:50:12,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1206
01:50:12,973 --> 01:50:13,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1207
01:50:14,789 --> 01:50:37,992
[SPEAKER_13]: when you look at these you do have to look at if you there so much uh studies have been done and information is sort of like uh the the uh level of uh of your socioeconomic and your economic standard throughout the city hey i know i know you're gonna you know you know more about your area right now and you can you know you can talk to me and i don't i don't know what you're talking about my point is

1208
01:50:39,053 --> 01:50:44,674
[SPEAKER_26]: It's just that's why young kids like me are leaving Medford to go to other places where they're just better school system.

1209
01:50:44,814 --> 01:50:53,376
[SPEAKER_13]: And for years and years and years, one of the things which has been so difficult for me is I see young families have leaving because they think there's a holy grail someplace else.

1210
01:50:53,716 --> 01:51:00,037
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what I've worked for on this committee for all these years of saying that we've got it in Medford and we can do great.

1211
01:51:00,317 --> 01:51:04,718
[SPEAKER_13]: The biggest difficulty is when we have a meeting, we discuss these things.

1212
01:51:05,682 --> 01:51:06,382
[SPEAKER_13]: and nobody shows up.

1213
01:51:07,363 --> 01:51:16,666
[SPEAKER_13]: And so how do I get the information to you so that you can talk to your neighbors and friends about how we're getting out?

1214
01:51:16,706 --> 01:51:22,728
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the things we did was, with great controversy, we just brought in a person to do publicity for us.

1215
01:51:23,308 --> 01:51:29,010
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we understand that one of the biggest problems we have is there are so many good things happening in Medford.

1216
01:51:29,250 --> 01:51:31,090
[SPEAKER_13]: If you were here earlier, you saw one of them.

1217
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:33,111
[SPEAKER_13]: But getting it out is tough.

1218
01:51:33,910 --> 01:51:35,173
[SPEAKER_13]: The publicity.

1219
01:51:35,233 --> 01:51:36,535
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1220
01:51:37,477 --> 01:51:38,398
[SPEAKER_13]: What was your question?

1221
01:51:39,941 --> 01:51:40,943
[SPEAKER_26]: I lost my train of thought.

1222
01:51:41,244 --> 01:51:41,885
[SPEAKER_13]: What was the good thing?

1223
01:51:43,227 --> 01:51:45,709
[SPEAKER_26]: Just for the publicity, is that what every school does?

1224
01:51:45,749 --> 01:51:47,229
[SPEAKER_26]: Hires a publicity agent?

1225
01:51:47,249 --> 01:51:48,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Many school systems have now.

1226
01:51:48,870 --> 01:51:49,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1227
01:51:49,671 --> 01:51:50,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Many school systems have.

1228
01:51:50,691 --> 01:51:51,072
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm pretty old.

1229
01:51:51,132 --> 01:51:52,833
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't remember having that when I was in school.

1230
01:51:52,993 --> 01:51:58,756
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that she does is she has a blog because we realize, I mean, how do we reach parents?

1231
01:51:59,256 --> 01:52:03,839
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we have to do it with the way that parents are looking at media now, and that's through a blog.

1232
01:52:04,059 --> 01:52:04,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1233
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,921
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the highlights of Medford is not working.

1234
01:52:09,301 --> 01:52:09,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Does not work.

1235
01:52:10,501 --> 01:52:11,242
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are trying.

1236
01:52:11,282 --> 01:52:11,922
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we're trying.

1237
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:12,962
[SPEAKER_13]: The communication is key.

1238
01:52:12,982 --> 01:52:13,963
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, the parents need to do better, too.

1239
01:52:14,263 --> 01:52:14,943
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm here to say that.

1240
01:52:14,963 --> 01:52:15,983
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why I'm here tonight.

1241
01:52:16,083 --> 01:52:16,703
[SPEAKER_26]: So, you know.

1242
01:52:16,723 --> 01:52:18,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I would look forward to talking to another.

1243
01:52:18,964 --> 01:52:21,385
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't get your information, but I'd love to further conversation.

1244
01:52:21,405 --> 01:52:21,845
[SPEAKER_26]: That's fine.

1245
01:52:22,085 --> 01:52:22,745
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll send you an email.

1246
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:23,206
[SPEAKER_26]: Great.

1247
01:52:23,306 --> 01:52:24,006
[SPEAKER_26]: Gmail account, right?

1248
01:52:24,226 --> 01:52:24,806
[SPEAKER_13]: P. VanderKloof.

1249
01:52:24,826 --> 01:52:26,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. VanderKloof.

1250
01:52:26,527 --> 01:52:28,547
[SPEAKER_18]: We have another citizen that would like to speak.

1251
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:35,970
[SPEAKER_25]: Sharlene Douglas, president of the Medford Teaching Association, resident of Medford,

1252
01:52:36,908 --> 01:52:41,210
[SPEAKER_25]: lifetime resident of Bedford, Mr. Belson was my teacher.

1253
01:52:43,491 --> 01:52:50,475
[SPEAKER_25]: 30 plus years as a teacher in the system and very proud to be a teacher in the public schools.

1254
01:52:52,256 --> 01:52:54,037
[SPEAKER_25]: I wasn't going to say this, but I have to.

1255
01:52:55,297 --> 01:53:02,381
[SPEAKER_25]: The word level three made my blood boil tonight because it's 2% of our student population.

1256
01:53:03,595 --> 01:53:10,977
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a level one high school, we have a level one vocational school, and the rest of our schools are all level two.

1257
01:53:11,777 --> 01:53:21,659
[SPEAKER_25]: We have a diverse population that matches the likes of an Everett, a Malden, a Revere, and we are far above them.

1258
01:53:22,260 --> 01:53:24,520
[SPEAKER_25]: We are an outstanding school district.

1259
01:53:24,820 --> 01:53:27,661
[SPEAKER_25]: And I take offense to any of these facts.

1260
01:53:34,803 --> 01:53:35,683
[SPEAKER_25]: Let me finish, please.

1261
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,425
[SPEAKER_25]: May I finish, please?

1262
01:53:38,465 --> 01:53:39,425
[SPEAKER_25]: And then you can clarify.

1263
01:53:41,146 --> 01:53:43,307
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Belson knows I'm extremely passionate.

1264
01:53:43,687 --> 01:53:46,108
[SPEAKER_25]: And he knows that I'm very opinionated also.

1265
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:47,809
[SPEAKER_25]: But he taught me that.

1266
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:51,730
[SPEAKER_25]: So today, no, not really.

1267
01:53:52,531 --> 01:53:54,292
[SPEAKER_25]: That was embedded from my mother.

1268
01:53:55,212 --> 01:54:02,215
[SPEAKER_25]: So today, I come before you at the request of the MTA executive board.

1269
01:54:02,795 --> 01:54:04,136
[SPEAKER_25]: We voted unanimously.

1270
01:54:05,662 --> 01:54:14,271
[SPEAKER_25]: for me to come here as president to speak with the school committee and the citizens of the city of Meffitt about our working relationship with Superintendent Roy Belson.

1271
01:54:15,091 --> 01:54:16,493
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Belson works with us

1272
01:54:18,445 --> 01:54:21,407
[SPEAKER_25]: and has the best interests of both the students and teachers at heart.

1273
01:54:22,268 --> 01:54:36,919
[SPEAKER_25]: While the administration and the Medford Teachers Association have differences, at the end of the day, we come to resolve conflicts in a professional manner, following the process, and involving third parties to resolve matters when necessary.

1274
01:54:37,619 --> 01:54:38,580
[SPEAKER_25]: Politically speaking,

1275
01:54:39,685 --> 01:54:52,928
[SPEAKER_25]: and politically supportive, Mr. Belson has spoken on the charter schools and stopping these schools from creating separate and unequal opportunities in a costly and device two-track school system.

1276
01:54:53,468 --> 01:55:04,350
[SPEAKER_25]: Superintendent Belson is a passionate supporter of public education, and we continue to work with him to ensure the best education for our youth here in the city of Medford.

1277
01:55:04,990 --> 01:55:05,290
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1278
01:55:24,029 --> 01:55:27,451
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to take this opportunity to thank everyone who came out tonight.

1279
01:55:27,531 --> 01:55:29,252
[SPEAKER_18]: We know this is a very important topic.

1280
01:55:29,292 --> 01:55:30,813
[SPEAKER_18]: We're not taking it lightly.

1281
01:55:30,833 --> 01:55:40,240
[SPEAKER_18]: The process is starting and there are meetings scheduled and we promise you that we will do our due diligence, include the public in different fashions so that we're able to reach out to them.

1282
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:42,181
[SPEAKER_18]: But thank you all for being here tonight on this topic.

1283
01:55:42,621 --> 01:55:42,901
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1284
01:55:52,507 --> 01:55:54,709
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion on the floor to revert to the regular order of business.

1285
01:55:54,749 --> 01:55:55,469
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

1286
01:55:56,250 --> 01:55:56,990
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1287
01:55:57,791 --> 01:55:58,632
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion is granted.

1288
01:55:58,792 --> 01:55:59,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Report of committees.

1289

[SPEAKER_18]: Subcommittee meeting on building and grounds.

1290
01:56:02,534 --> 01:56:02,694
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1291
01:56:02,735 --> 01:56:03,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Cuneo.

1292
01:56:06,826 --> 01:56:11,991
[SPEAKER_14]: The buildings and grounds subcommittee was called to order at 7.05 by the chairperson, myself.

1293
01:56:12,572 --> 01:56:15,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Subcommittee members present were Kathy Kretz and Paulette Vander Kloot.

1294
01:56:16,195 --> 01:56:20,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Also present were school committee members, Aaron DiBenedetto and Robert Scari, Jr.

1295
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:22,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, Superintendent Roy E. Belson, Director of

1296
01:56:23,658 --> 01:56:35,824
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, also Superintendent Roy E. Belson, Director of Finance and Administration, Patricia Villa, Director of Buildings and Grounds, John McLaughlin, Assistant Director of PE, Health and Community Schools, Rachel Perry.

1297
01:56:36,525 --> 01:56:46,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Community members present include Katie Martin from the Mephits Orca, and Dennis McDonald of the Office of Energy and Environment.

1298
01:56:47,050 --> 01:56:48,551
[SPEAKER_14]: We all rose to salute the flag.

1299
01:56:48,731 --> 01:56:52,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Chairperson myself asked the superintendent to explain the purpose of the meeting.

1300
01:56:52,973 --> 01:56:55,176
[SPEAKER_14]: The superintendent explained the purpose as follows.

1301
01:56:55,417 --> 01:57:01,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Review the specification conditions for the proposed winter season bubble on Edgeley Field.

1302
01:57:01,886 --> 01:57:07,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Review the proposed facilities, rental agreement, and fee schedule for the Meffitt Community Schools Program.

1303
01:57:07,935 --> 01:57:14,521
[SPEAKER_14]: The superintendent informed the subcommittee of two additional comments that must be discussed as we go forward with discussion.

1304
01:57:15,382 --> 01:57:27,393
[SPEAKER_14]: OCD director Lauren DiLorenzo explained that since federal CDB HUD funds were used to remove architectural barriers from the entrance and exit to the field, the use of the bubble would

1305
01:57:28,414 --> 01:57:31,456
[SPEAKER_14]: have to make the same accessibility provisions as the pool.

1306
01:57:32,157 --> 01:57:37,001
[SPEAKER_14]: This means that the facility must take provisions for low-income and disabled users.

1307
01:57:37,681 --> 01:57:42,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, any profits might have to go back and reimburse HUD funding.

1308
01:57:44,050 --> 01:57:46,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Ken Kraus raised several environmental concerns.

1309
01:57:47,454 --> 01:57:58,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Need to construct the proposed parking lot with appropriate stormwater management techniques, possible impact on the fells, and the size and location of the field house.

1310
01:57:58,589 --> 01:58:01,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Possible impact upon Winthrop Street development.

1311
01:58:02,978 --> 01:58:11,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Dennis McDougall from the Energy and Environment Office suggested that installations of the appropriate drainage as part of the parking lot was a must.

1312
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:17,001
[SPEAKER_14]: He also would have preferred pavers as an alternative to hardtop for the parking lot.

1313
01:58:17,401 --> 01:58:19,642
[SPEAKER_14]: He recognized that the cost would be very high.

1314
01:58:20,382 --> 01:58:26,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Superintendent explained that Winthrop Street development has not even been submitted and that it would not affect the parking area.

1315
01:58:27,444 --> 01:58:32,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, the field house size had not yet been established, but it would probably be about 1,000 square feet.

1316
01:58:33,606 --> 01:58:37,209
[SPEAKER_14]: The parking lot would not be adjacent to the Middlesex Fells area.

1317
01:58:38,090 --> 01:58:42,294
[SPEAKER_14]: The committee then began a review of RFP guidelines for the bubble structure.

1318
01:58:42,534 --> 01:58:44,376
[SPEAKER_14]: The committee took the following actions.

1319
01:58:45,017 --> 01:58:47,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Added the words with appropriate drainage.

1320
01:58:48,180 --> 01:58:54,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Specified the fieldhouse have at least two toilets in each of the male and female bathroom areas.

1321
01:58:55,047 --> 01:58:57,209
[SPEAKER_14]: Further that they be handicapped accessibility.

1322
01:58:58,310 --> 01:59:04,615
[SPEAKER_14]: required the vendor and contractor to hold a four-hour open house at least once during the season for the community.

1323
01:59:05,075 --> 01:59:07,196
[SPEAKER_14]: This would be listed as number 15.

1324
01:59:08,017 --> 01:59:13,201
[SPEAKER_14]: There was considerable discussion on how the schedule of the bubble could provide more time for community use.

1325
01:59:13,841 --> 01:59:26,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Suggestions included such ideas as having the contractor start later on Wednesdays, adding a later finishing time in exchange for more time in the afternoon and weekends, sharing space during contractor time.

1326
01:59:27,690 --> 01:59:30,491
[SPEAKER_14]: These ideas were rejected for several reasons.

1327
01:59:31,051 --> 01:59:40,174
[SPEAKER_14]: There was concern that the hours available would not be conducive for parents to bring children and youth to the facility during the afternoon hours.

1328
01:59:40,835 --> 01:59:46,156
[SPEAKER_14]: There was discussion that the facility could provide opportunities for adult residents, like the pool does.

1329
01:59:46,897 --> 01:59:50,398
[SPEAKER_14]: For example, there could be tennis, golf, track-related activities.

1330
01:59:50,878 --> 01:59:56,020
[SPEAKER_14]: While the adult use was understood, the committee was trying to find more time for children and youth.

1331
01:59:56,866 --> 02:00:02,128
[SPEAKER_14]: Ultimately, the committee opted to include a four-hour open house requirement once per season.

1332
02:00:02,768 --> 02:00:03,549
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Ms.

1333
02:00:03,589 --> 02:00:05,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Vander Kloot, seconded by Ms.

1334
02:00:05,049 --> 02:00:13,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Kretz, the subcommittee voted 3-0 to forward and recommend the amended RFP guidelines to the full school committee.

1335
02:00:14,106 --> 02:00:15,287
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see that attached.

1336
02:00:15,747 --> 02:00:19,749
[SPEAKER_14]: The subcommittee then began its review of the proposed facilities rental agreement.

1337
02:00:20,230 --> 02:00:24,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Director of Finance and Administration took the subcommittee through each page.

1338
02:00:24,913 --> 02:00:30,116
[SPEAKER_14]: Discussion was held at intervals as each member raised questions and or made suggestions.

1339
02:00:30,576 --> 02:00:33,798
[SPEAKER_14]: The following represents the changes made by the subcommittee.

1340
02:00:35,376 --> 02:00:39,940
[SPEAKER_14]: The liability insurance requirement was changed to maybe from it is required.

1341
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:43,242
[SPEAKER_14]: The age of 21 was submitted for the word minors.

1342
02:00:43,823 --> 02:00:48,146
[SPEAKER_14]: On page four, the time of activity termination was changed from 11.30 p.m.

1343
02:00:48,587 --> 02:00:49,808
[SPEAKER_14]: to 11 o'clock p.m.

1344
02:00:50,528 --> 02:00:52,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Hormel Stadium line was altered as follows.

1345
02:00:53,691 --> 02:00:56,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Hormel Stadium rentals are controlled by the Hormel Commission.

1346
02:00:57,113 --> 02:00:58,214
[SPEAKER_14]: Contact information

1347
02:00:59,595 --> 02:01:17,010
[SPEAKER_14]: 7, 8, 1, 3, 9, 3, 2, 3, 8, 0.

1348
02:01:02,097 --> 02:01:17,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Under pool fees, the resident fee for birthday parties was raised to $275—actually, while I'm reading this, I just wanted a clarification on this—raised to $275 from $125 per hour, or was it—I don't—if I just want to ask Rachel.

1349
02:01:18,231 --> 02:01:22,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Because then it also says, the birthday party rental included up to two lifeguards.

1350
02:01:22,634 --> 02:01:28,298
[SPEAKER_14]: If the swimmer numbers exceed 20, then additional lifeguards and apical costs will apply.

1351
02:01:28,838 --> 02:01:31,600
[SPEAKER_14]: On page 7, the rental fees for Edgley Field were changed.

1352
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:35,583
[SPEAKER_14]: Categories 1, 2, 3 remained at $145 per hour.

1353
02:01:36,183 --> 02:01:39,686
[SPEAKER_14]: Category 4, for-profit, went to $185.

1354
02:01:40,286 --> 02:01:43,068
[SPEAKER_14]: Non-resident, non-profit, went to $165.

1355
02:01:43,669 --> 02:01:44,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Under food service fees,

1356
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:48,292

1357
02:01:48,772 --> 02:01:52,214
[SPEAKER_14]: The chip, myself, called for a 10-minute recess.

1358
02:01:52,734 --> 02:02:02,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Members were asked to review the last three pages of the proposal, which contained the faculty, the facility usage request form, and the release identification agreement.

1359
02:02:02,720 --> 02:02:06,082
[SPEAKER_14]: The subcommittee convened and agreed that the forms looked good.

1360
02:02:06,422 --> 02:02:08,263
[SPEAKER_14]: They will be reviewed by legal counsel.

1361
02:02:08,803 --> 02:02:09,544
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Ms.

1362
02:02:09,584 --> 02:02:10,824

02:02:10,864 --> 02:02:12,005

1364
02:02:12,245 --> 02:02:18,189
[SPEAKER_14]: to recommend the facilities rental agreement proposal as amended to the full school committee, three to zero.

1365
02:02:18,770 --> 02:02:29,517
[SPEAKER_14]: The subcommittee then received the financial reports on community schools, the pool, Edgeley Field, La Conte Ring, and again, see the attached overview of financial documents are on file.

1366
02:02:30,203 --> 02:02:35,305
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition to the report, the materials presented to the subcommittee asked to receive the following information.

02:02:40,786 --> 02:02:43,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Names of employees who have worked the pool, field, and rink.

1369
02:02:43,947 --> 02:02:45,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Clear breakout of pending review.

1370
02:02:47,669 --> 02:02:49,049
[SPEAKER_14]: The subcommittee on the motion, Ms.

1371
02:02:49,089 --> 02:02:49,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Kretz, seconded by Ms.

1372
02:02:49,969 --> 02:02:52,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Vander Kloot, voted to adjourn at 10.05 p.m.

1373
02:02:52,850 --> 02:02:53,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Respectfully submitted.

1374
02:02:53,851 --> 02:02:55,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Ann Marie Cuno, your chairperson.

1375
02:02:56,251 --> 02:02:57,572
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have clarification on that?

1376
02:02:57,712 --> 02:02:57,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

1377
02:02:59,202 --> 02:03:06,707
[SPEAKER_05]: The birthday parties were $200 for Medford residents, and you voted that we would raise that to $275 for non-residents.

1378
02:03:07,988 --> 02:03:14,873
[SPEAKER_05]: So that $200 includes the rental of the pool for an hour, the cafeteria for an hour, and two lifeguards.

1379
02:03:15,133 --> 02:03:19,176
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's more than 20 swimmers, we have to put another lifeguard on, and that would be an extra $25.

1380
02:03:19,216 --> 02:03:20,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1381
02:03:20,477 --> 02:03:21,597
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1382
02:03:21,617 --> 02:03:22,058
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

1383
02:03:25,043 --> 02:03:25,223
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1384
02:03:25,263 --> 02:03:25,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Vandekloot.

1385
02:03:26,604 --> 02:03:46,355
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to mention that in terms on page three, where it gives the list of changes, there should be eight that a four-hour open house requirement once per season was added.

1386
02:03:46,896 --> 02:03:52,079
[SPEAKER_13]: It is added in the document, but it's just not added in that numerical list.

1387
02:03:53,559 --> 02:03:54,380
[SPEAKER_18]: In the IRP list?

1388
02:03:55,661 --> 02:04:03,628
[SPEAKER_13]: So in the list that Anne-Marie just read on the third page, it's mentioned on the second page, but it's not included.

1389
02:04:05,029 --> 02:04:08,032
[SPEAKER_13]: The following represents the changes made by the subcommittee.

1390
02:04:08,912 --> 02:04:10,113
[SPEAKER_13]: So that should be number eight.

1391
02:04:14,757 --> 02:04:16,619
[SPEAKER_13]: So if I could ask for a correction on that.

1392
02:04:17,299 --> 02:04:19,621
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion for correction, Mr. Superintendent.

1393
02:04:22,883 --> 02:04:28,048
[SPEAKER_18]: If we could just sever this paper, the first item being the bubble, there's a motion of Ms.

1394
02:04:28,088 --> 02:04:29,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Vandekloot, seconded by Ms.

1395
02:04:29,109 --> 02:04:38,397
[SPEAKER_18]: Kretz in the subcommittee meeting, that you voted 3-0 to forward and recommend the amended RFP guidelines to the full school committee as amended by Ms.

1396
02:04:38,417 --> 02:04:39,418
[SPEAKER_18]: Vandekloot on the floor.

1397
02:04:41,140 --> 02:04:43,963
[SPEAKER_18]: On that motion to accept the RFP as amended

1398
02:04:45,683 --> 02:04:46,323
[SPEAKER_16]: Mister Bennett.

1399
02:04:46,623 --> 02:04:47,004
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1400
02:04:47,564 --> 02:04:50,185
[SPEAKER_16]: I reviewed this and it's really great.

1401
02:04:50,685 --> 02:04:53,767
[SPEAKER_16]: There's just the RFP that is attached.

1402
02:04:54,207 --> 02:04:55,608
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could look at number seven.

1403
02:04:56,868 --> 02:05:12,734
[SPEAKER_16]: It says there should be sufficient insurance coverage borne by the vendor to cover any liability damage or liability The city must be held harmless all employees of the contractor who work on-site must be quarry checked and then it goes on to say Appropriate security.

1404
02:05:12,794 --> 02:05:20,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Can we just define what appropriate is so that way there's no error in understanding with with the vendor So

1405
02:05:23,005 --> 02:05:29,807
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember, and this is something that was misunderstood, and I heard this at a council meeting, that this is not the RFP.

1406
02:05:29,887 --> 02:05:35,189
[SPEAKER_23]: These are guidelines to the procurement office to develop an RFP.

1407
02:05:35,689 --> 02:05:48,693
[SPEAKER_23]: So they need to flesh out the specifics of security or other things, because if we get too tight right now, in their process, they may not be able to put something together that is appropriate for a vendor.

1408
02:05:50,233 --> 02:05:56,060
[SPEAKER_23]: If you set up a security plan that's around the clock or something like that, they may say that's prohibitive, no one's going to bid on it.

1409
02:05:56,961 --> 02:06:02,267
[SPEAKER_23]: We've got to get something from procurement, let them check with other people as to what's likely to go through.

1410
02:06:02,828 --> 02:06:05,651
[SPEAKER_23]: The same thing is true of other elements of this.

1411
02:06:05,671 --> 02:06:08,875
[SPEAKER_23]: This is guidance to the procurement officer.

1412
02:06:08,895 --> 02:06:10,677
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember, the procurement is going to come back to you.

1413
02:06:11,725 --> 02:06:13,326
[SPEAKER_23]: You're going to see the actual document.

1414
02:06:13,907 --> 02:06:15,388
[SPEAKER_23]: So this is really guidance.

1415
02:06:15,448 --> 02:06:19,291
[SPEAKER_23]: Let the procurement officer actually spell out a little title and you'll be better off.

1416
02:06:19,651 --> 02:06:19,951
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

1417
02:06:19,991 --> 02:06:27,457
[SPEAKER_18]: Just in general for insurance coverage, there's stipulations that go into all the contracts we write and that would be what will be in the RFP, not what we've written here.

1418
02:06:27,697 --> 02:06:28,018
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1419
02:06:28,138 --> 02:06:36,484
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also just want to bring it to attention that these are items that I'll be looking at as, as bids come in and I want to take, have to meet the minimum bid.

1420
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:36,744
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1421
02:06:36,864 --> 02:06:38,125
[SPEAKER_16]: And this, and then number 12,

1422
02:06:39,757 --> 02:06:42,078
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the end of the season.

1423
02:06:42,878 --> 02:06:46,739
[SPEAKER_16]: They have to deliver the field in the same condition as it was before.

1424
02:06:47,079 --> 02:06:51,040
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to have a certified evaluator to look at the field at that time.

1425
02:06:51,561 --> 02:06:58,703
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to be more specific, not just anyone from the school department walking through who doesn't really understand.

1426
02:06:59,503 --> 02:07:00,184
[SPEAKER_16]: how the field was.

1427
02:07:00,204 --> 02:07:01,545
[SPEAKER_16]: We can do that outside of the RFP.

1428
02:07:01,745 --> 02:07:01,805
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1429
02:07:01,825 --> 02:07:03,406
[SPEAKER_16]: That could be our internal procedure.

1430
02:07:03,666 --> 02:07:03,966
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

1431
02:07:04,147 --> 02:07:08,710
[SPEAKER_16]: As long as it's understood that, you know, I just want to make sure we do it right in the beginning.

1432
02:07:08,910 --> 02:07:14,294
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to come back and say, I wish we added that word or just change those little issues.

1433
02:07:14,975 --> 02:07:15,215
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.

1434
02:07:15,235 --> 02:07:16,075
[SPEAKER_23]: Just one more thing.

1435
02:07:16,095 --> 02:07:22,480
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, there are a lot of stories and comments being made outside of us that sometimes mislead the public.

1436
02:07:22,961 --> 02:07:26,603
[SPEAKER_23]: And I want to make sure we clarify, just as we talked about, this was not the RFP.

1437
02:07:26,623 --> 02:07:28,825
[SPEAKER_23]: This was the guidelines for the development of an RFP.

1438
02:07:29,562 --> 02:07:38,325
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, the second piece is that there was some comment at a council meeting that dealt with the cleaning of the fields, that no deep cleaning had taken place.

1439
02:07:38,745 --> 02:07:39,445
[SPEAKER_23]: That's not true.

1440
02:07:40,145 --> 02:07:41,606
[SPEAKER_23]: We actually have the invoices.

1441
02:07:41,646 --> 02:07:42,906
[SPEAKER_23]: We actually have the procedure.

1442
02:07:42,946 --> 02:07:48,368
[SPEAKER_23]: And we actually have the details that they did a deep cleaning on a regular basis.

1443
02:07:48,388 --> 02:07:58,711
[SPEAKER_23]: So I want to make that clear that, you know, some people say things and, you know, they may think it's true, but we have backup information, which I can provide to you at a subsequent time.

1444
02:07:59,192 --> 02:08:06,074
[SPEAKER_23]: which shows that a deep cleaning was actually done, and the process and procedures spelled out as to what a deep cleaning actually is.

1445
02:08:06,594 --> 02:08:16,156
[SPEAKER_23]: So just for your information, in case you're asked, we've been doing deep cleanings because it was associated that if we didn't do deep cleanings, the longevity of the field would be compromised.

1446
02:08:16,616 --> 02:08:17,476
[SPEAKER_23]: We do deep cleanings.

1447
02:08:19,557 --> 02:08:19,957
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1448
02:08:19,997 --> 02:08:24,578
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a motion to accept the bubble RFP guidelines to submit to procurement?

1449
02:08:27,732 --> 02:08:28,492
[SPEAKER_18]: As amended by Ms.

1450
02:08:28,512 --> 02:08:29,033
[SPEAKER_18]: Vander Kloot.

1451
02:08:29,994 --> 02:08:31,175
[SPEAKER_18]: Please call the roll, Mr. Skerry.

1452
02:08:31,215 --> 02:08:31,355
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1453
02:08:31,575 --> 02:08:32,015
[SPEAKER_18]: Cunha.

1454
02:08:32,056 --> 02:08:32,216
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1455
02:08:32,236 --> 02:08:32,316
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1456
02:08:32,976 --> 02:08:33,437
[SPEAKER_20]: Mandela.

1457
02:08:33,717 --> 02:08:33,997
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1458
02:08:34,157 --> 02:08:34,238
Ms.

1459
02:08:34,338 --> 02:08:34,578
Kratz.

1460
02:08:39,467 --> 02:08:42,908
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, that motion passes.

1461
02:08:43,988 --> 02:08:48,749
[SPEAKER_18]: The second item is to recommend the facility's rental agreement proposal.

1462
02:08:49,709 --> 02:08:54,050
[SPEAKER_18]: If I could, from the floor, that proposal also includes the fee schedule.

1463
02:08:54,910 --> 02:09:01,792
[SPEAKER_18]: And I've received a few calls over the past couple of days, actually, of people that are internal,

1464
02:09:03,833 --> 02:09:06,555
[SPEAKER_18]: that are very concerned about the increase in the fees.

1465
02:09:06,996 --> 02:09:19,087
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'd ask that the agreement go to legal and be processed, but that the fee schedule be, have a public hearing, public meeting, so that the public can come forth and tell us their concerns for our own Medford youth programs.

1466
02:09:20,192 --> 02:09:22,653
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a motion on the second?

1467
02:09:23,013 --> 02:09:23,634
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Ms.

1468
02:09:23,654 --> 02:09:24,194
[SPEAKER_18]: Vander Kloof.

1469
02:09:24,374 --> 02:09:25,174
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

1470
02:09:25,534 --> 02:09:25,635
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

1471
02:09:26,055 --> 02:09:26,935
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1472
02:09:26,995 --> 02:09:28,696
[SPEAKER_18]: That document will be sent to legal.

1473
02:09:29,136 --> 02:09:38,560
[SPEAKER_18]: We will hold the fee schedule in obedience until we have a meeting with the youth organizations throughout the community so that we get a fee schedule that they can actually afford to participate in.

1474
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:43,362
[SPEAKER_18]: The last thing we want to do is isolate this field, that we do not have our programs involved.

1475
02:09:43,769 --> 02:09:44,510
[SPEAKER_09]: name and address, please.

1476
02:09:44,910 --> 02:09:47,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Name is Alicia Rourke, 47 Hutchins Road.

1477
02:09:47,852 --> 02:09:59,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, in reviewing the document, um, I found the categories a bit interesting and that they weren't necessarily in line with how other, um, departments within the city function.

1478
02:09:59,761 --> 02:10:04,345
[SPEAKER_09]: For instance, our parks commission, they do have for, um,

1479
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:08,792
[SPEAKER_09]: divisions that's based on the rate schedule.

1480
02:10:09,172 --> 02:10:12,914
[SPEAKER_09]: However, they're quite different than what has been submitted in this proposal.

1481
02:10:14,735 --> 02:10:23,640
[SPEAKER_09]: For the Park Commission, they allow for select teams that are comprised of 75% of Medford residents.

1482
02:10:24,220 --> 02:10:26,502
[SPEAKER_09]: These select teams are often for profit.

1483
02:10:27,782 --> 02:10:31,765
[SPEAKER_09]: They would fall under the higher rated for profit rates.

1484
02:10:32,872 --> 02:10:39,177
[SPEAKER_09]: the way that this document has been created, a non-profit would pay a much lesser rate.

1485
02:10:39,658 --> 02:10:41,479
[SPEAKER_09]: The NFL is a non-profit.

1486
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:54,750
[SPEAKER_09]: So the NFL could come and ask to use Edgley Field at a much lower rate than what, say, a kids' club soccer team would pay.

1487
02:10:55,330 --> 02:10:59,934
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that there really needs to be a much better understanding of

1488
02:11:01,115 --> 02:11:07,659
[SPEAKER_09]: athletics and the way that they work in the community, when you're looking at this and the fee schedule and how it's structured.

1489
02:11:08,759 --> 02:11:09,160
Thank you.

1490
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:10,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Point taken.

1491
02:11:10,781 --> 02:11:11,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

1492
02:11:11,801 --> 02:11:18,585
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Burke, I just wanted to note a change that we commented on at that committee meeting.

1493
02:11:19,306 --> 02:11:26,870
[SPEAKER_16]: On the facilities rental agreement, first page, page one of 11, item number two,

1494
02:11:28,543 --> 02:11:36,989
[SPEAKER_16]: The completed application formed together with all necessary documentation, including certificate of insurance, if required, and a security deposit.

1495
02:11:37,810 --> 02:11:44,195
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought we had changed that to non-refundable security deposit for certain situations.

1496
02:11:44,675 --> 02:11:45,736
[SPEAKER_18]: But that's what a security deposit was.

1497
02:11:46,296 --> 02:11:46,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1498
02:11:46,656 --> 02:11:48,738
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't say that, and we were adding that.

1499
02:11:49,138 --> 02:11:55,403
[SPEAKER_16]: At that meeting, I had it highlighted from that meeting, as well as- Where are we?

1500
02:11:56,143 --> 02:11:56,864
[SPEAKER_18]: Which bullet is it?

1501
02:11:57,364 --> 02:11:57,905
[SPEAKER_16]: It's number two.

1502
02:12:00,762 --> 02:12:01,022
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

1503
02:12:01,082 --> 02:12:02,544
[SPEAKER_23]: What page are we talking about?

1504
02:12:02,624 --> 02:12:04,105
[SPEAKER_18]: It's right here.

1505
02:12:04,285 --> 02:12:05,286
[SPEAKER_18]: Page 1, item 2.

1506
02:12:05,666 --> 02:12:08,589
[SPEAKER_18]: Page 1, item 2.

1507
02:12:14,734 --> 02:12:15,755
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not clear, though.

1508
02:12:15,775 --> 02:12:22,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Because if someone puts up a security deposit and the facility is left as it was when they came, they would be refunded.

1509
02:12:22,100 --> 02:12:23,281
[SPEAKER_18]: So it can't be.

1510
02:12:23,301 --> 02:12:25,203
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's supposed to be clarified.

1511
02:12:25,303 --> 02:12:27,685
[SPEAKER_16]: Non-refundable for cancellation purposes.

1512
02:12:29,819 --> 02:12:32,560
[SPEAKER_18]: So what is the non-refundable security deposit?

1513
02:12:32,620 --> 02:12:34,300
[SPEAKER_16]: It cancels within 48 hours.

1514
02:12:34,420 --> 02:12:35,821
[SPEAKER_18]: It cancels within 48 hours.

1515
02:12:37,841 --> 02:12:39,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Unless they're in 48 hours.

1516
02:12:39,642 --> 02:12:44,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you agreed to?

1517
02:12:44,263 --> 02:12:45,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1518
02:12:47,064 --> 02:12:50,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuno.

1519
02:12:51,106 --> 02:12:51,406
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry.

1520
02:12:51,786 --> 02:12:52,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry about that.

1521
02:12:53,326 --> 02:12:58,768
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a question on the 48 hours only because if it's certain, let's say it's a soccer group.

1522
02:12:59,317 --> 02:13:03,402
[SPEAKER_14]: and because of weather, they don't know that they're going to be cancelling within 48 hours.

1523
02:13:03,963 --> 02:13:06,746
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was what we were discussing.

1524
02:13:06,866 --> 02:13:11,131
[SPEAKER_14]: We did discuss that there would be a non-refund, but I'm not sure about the 48 hours.

1525
02:13:15,079 --> 02:13:19,502
[SPEAKER_13]: I was thinking about things like a birthday party is a good example.

1526
02:13:20,002 --> 02:13:27,047
[SPEAKER_13]: If all of a sudden it's canceled in the last 48 hours before, we can't go out and rent it again, okay?

1527
02:13:27,467 --> 02:13:32,791
[SPEAKER_13]: And any other place where a parent would be going to have that kind of function would have a

1528
02:13:35,012 --> 02:13:38,556
[SPEAKER_13]: have some kind of cancellation policy.

1529
02:13:40,157 --> 02:13:43,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't thinking about a field and it rains.

1530
02:13:43,541 --> 02:13:45,763
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that seems like a different sort of contingency.

1531
02:13:47,024 --> 02:13:52,369
[SPEAKER_13]: So, again, how we define this in here, we might need to take a look at that.

1532
02:13:53,270 --> 02:13:54,972
[SPEAKER_13]: But if we have a theater group

1533
02:13:55,386 --> 02:14:06,509
[SPEAKER_13]: you know, who's renting the Caron Theater, and all of a sudden they decide not to hold the performance, should we bear the entire cost of their cancellation, of their last minute cancellation?

1534
02:14:07,069 --> 02:14:11,691
[SPEAKER_13]: I think any place where you go would expect some remuneration.

1535
02:14:12,851 --> 02:14:14,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Not necessarily great, but some.

1536
02:14:18,653 --> 02:14:18,833
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1537
02:14:18,853 --> 02:14:19,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuneo, chairperson.

1538
02:14:22,282 --> 02:14:29,868
[SPEAKER_14]: could have sworn that we had written it down, that we had come to the conclusion, and we were going to bring it forward to this meeting, of how we were going to present it.

1539
02:14:29,908 --> 02:14:32,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there were different scenarios for different situations.

1540
02:14:33,431 --> 02:14:39,956
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think at that point, we were going to bring it here to have it clarified, as far as the time was.

1541
02:14:39,976 --> 02:14:41,857
[SPEAKER_18]: We need the proper language in order to vote for it.

1542
02:14:44,667 --> 02:14:46,028
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1543
02:14:46,048 --> 02:14:46,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Vander Kloot.

1544
02:14:46,649 --> 02:14:57,640
[SPEAKER_13]: From my reading of it is if we do a correction on number 2 on page 1 of 11 and say a non-refundable security deposit may be required upon acceptance of rental.

1545
02:14:59,089 --> 02:15:16,240
[SPEAKER_13]: That, right now, puts it in this document, and then if we need to be more specific in terms of which of the, if we want to spell out which of the, when we might require a... So it gets canceled within 48 hours of event?

1546
02:15:18,322 --> 02:15:19,843
[SPEAKER_18]: What's the objective?

1547
02:15:22,366 --> 02:15:29,472
[SPEAKER_13]: to prevent people from saying they were going to rent a place and then willy-nilly just turning around and not showing up.

1548
02:15:29,892 --> 02:15:33,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Would date, how many hours beforehand can they cancel?

1549
02:15:33,555 --> 02:15:34,836
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a cancellation policy?

1550
02:15:35,957 --> 02:15:38,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, when we did it, we had done 48 hours.

1551
02:15:38,939 --> 02:15:41,081
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't necessarily know if that's enough, but that's.

1552
02:15:44,684 --> 02:15:45,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

1553
02:15:45,905 --> 02:15:46,245
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

1554
02:15:46,865 --> 02:15:50,849
[SPEAKER_16]: We had also commented on 72 hours at that meeting at that time.

1555
02:15:53,342 --> 02:15:53,862
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you remember that?

1556
02:15:53,882 --> 02:15:54,943
[SPEAKER_23]: No, just the one item.

1557
02:15:55,043 --> 02:15:56,203
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's wrap it up.

1558
02:15:56,463 --> 02:15:56,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, OK.

1559
02:15:57,284 --> 02:15:58,785
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and then I wasn't finished.

1560
02:15:59,105 --> 02:16:01,766
[SPEAKER_16]: There is another section on page five.

1561
02:16:02,666 --> 02:16:03,507
[SPEAKER_16]: You know me, Roy.

1562
02:16:03,727 --> 02:16:04,847
[SPEAKER_16]: I look for every detail.

1563
02:16:05,408 --> 02:16:05,728
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

1564
02:16:05,748 --> 02:16:07,549
[SPEAKER_18]: Was it discussed in the subcommittee?

1565
02:16:07,589 --> 02:16:07,889
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1566
02:16:08,169 --> 02:16:18,134
[SPEAKER_16]: In the Homel Stadium, it was Homel Stadium usage is controlled by Homel Commission, not rentals.

1567
02:16:18,814 --> 02:16:19,934
[SPEAKER_16]: So the usage is

1568
02:16:21,482 --> 02:16:21,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Right?

1569
02:16:22,783 --> 02:16:23,424
[SPEAKER_16]: Didn't we change it?

1570
02:16:23,444 --> 02:16:25,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Or was it usage and we changed it to rentals?

1571
02:16:27,308 --> 02:16:28,689
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it, you know, is it different?

1572
02:16:28,709 --> 02:16:34,875
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, basically, we're losing... Ms.

1573
02:16:34,935 --> 02:16:36,797
[SPEAKER_18]: Cuno, chairperson of the subcommittee.

1574
02:16:36,957 --> 02:16:43,143
[SPEAKER_14]: On the Hormel Stadium rentals are controlled by Hormel Commission because the rentals themselves, as far as we were told,

1575
02:16:43,663 --> 02:17:00,390
[SPEAKER_14]: The rentals themselves are through the commission, but as far as the usage, I believe that our athletic director also has purview on the times if we have our teams that are going to be playing, and he's here, so he could clarify that.

1576
02:17:01,171 --> 02:17:01,851
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Maloney.

1577
02:17:06,373 --> 02:17:08,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Robert Maloney, Sheridan Ave.

1578
02:17:08,934 --> 02:17:11,255
[SPEAKER_12]: The Hormel Commission is in charge of Hormel Stadium.

1579
02:17:12,612 --> 02:17:15,453
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to go through the commission, they meet once a month across the hall.

1580
02:17:16,393 --> 02:17:22,715
[SPEAKER_12]: I schedule the field, I invoice the field, I pay the bills at the field.

1581
02:17:23,536 --> 02:17:25,656
[SPEAKER_12]: I meet with Jack Buckley and his commission once a month.

1582
02:17:27,297 --> 02:17:29,498
[SPEAKER_12]: I schedule that like I schedule Edgeley Field.

1583
02:17:30,878 --> 02:17:33,159
[SPEAKER_12]: I want to thank you on a couple things tonight you've already done.

1584
02:17:33,179 --> 02:17:36,440
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a couple groups here tonight.

1585
02:17:37,174 --> 02:17:41,155
[SPEAKER_12]: The fee structure, I think we really need another meeting, maybe another subcommittee.

1586
02:17:41,175 --> 02:17:41,815
[SPEAKER_12]: It's important.

1587
02:17:42,996 --> 02:17:47,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize for not being at your committee the whole meeting, or subcommittee meeting.

1588
02:17:47,797 --> 02:17:48,337
[SPEAKER_12]: I was away.

1589
02:17:49,177 --> 02:17:52,858
[SPEAKER_12]: But we cannot price these youth groups out.

1590
02:17:53,338 --> 02:17:57,820
[SPEAKER_12]: If you decide to price these youth groups out, you're going to commit political suicide.

1591
02:17:59,300 --> 02:18:06,542
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there was a recommendation, as you leave field, to go up to 145 for the youth groups, just for your edification.

1592
02:18:08,076 --> 02:18:10,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Method Youth Soccer, which is a fantastic group.

1593
02:18:12,359 --> 02:18:15,121
[SPEAKER_12]: I know Anne Marie's been a part of it for 100 years.

1594
02:18:16,062 --> 02:18:19,604
[SPEAKER_12]: They pay $75 an hour for that field in Hormel Stadium.

1595
02:18:20,665 --> 02:18:26,529
[SPEAKER_12]: If you go up to 145 on those kids, you're going to have serious issues.

1596
02:18:28,671 --> 02:18:31,072
[SPEAKER_18]: But I want to thank you for moving that forward.

1597
02:18:31,153 --> 02:18:34,315
[SPEAKER_12]: But as far as Hormel, I schedule Hormel and I schedule Edgeley.

1598
02:18:35,376 --> 02:18:40,639
[SPEAKER_18]: And the purpose of the fields beyond socially edgily for high school sports is for the youth in our community.

1599
02:18:40,679 --> 02:18:42,459
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's, I mean, that is the pecking order.

1600
02:18:42,579 --> 02:18:45,081
[SPEAKER_18]: So we appreciate that and we're not going to price them out.

1601
02:18:45,121 --> 02:18:46,762
[SPEAKER_18]: They're built for that purpose.

1602
02:18:46,922 --> 02:18:48,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Points of clarification.

1603
02:18:48,242 --> 02:18:50,703
[SPEAKER_14]: We weren't, we didn't have that information.

1604
02:18:50,763 --> 02:18:52,324
[SPEAKER_14]: We were told that it was $145.

1605
02:18:53,245 --> 02:19:04,210
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we were looking at, when we were looking at the rates, we actually decided that we want to make sure that we kept our youth programs as they are paying now, because we didn't want to raise

1606
02:19:05,052 --> 02:19:07,576
[SPEAKER_14]: So the $75 is something- They pay $75 an hour for practice.

1607
02:19:10,840 --> 02:19:15,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Monday through Friday night, and they pay $100 for a game on a weekend, which is an hour and a half.

1608
02:19:15,722 --> 02:19:18,063
[SPEAKER_12]: So they're getting a 50% discount.

1609
02:19:18,644 --> 02:19:24,526
[SPEAKER_12]: And I believe they're very happy with it, and they would not be able to take an increase.

1610
02:19:24,586 --> 02:19:27,508
[SPEAKER_14]: That will totally be reviewed, the price structure.

1611
02:19:27,548 --> 02:19:28,568
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, that's what I want to make sure.

1612
02:19:29,088 --> 02:19:32,170
[SPEAKER_14]: So could I motion for a subcommittee meeting?

1613
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:36,792
[SPEAKER_18]: We just voted on it, that we pulled out the rate schedule from that approval process.

1614
02:19:37,272 --> 02:19:38,492
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, we've got it.

1615
02:19:40,658 --> 02:19:40,838
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1616
02:19:40,858 --> 02:19:41,819
[SPEAKER_18]: Van de Kloot was first.

1617
02:19:42,379 --> 02:19:42,539
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1618
02:19:42,559 --> 02:19:42,940
[SPEAKER_18]: Van de Kloot.

1619
02:19:43,160 --> 02:19:51,764
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just, since we're having that subcommittee, it would be a fine time to also discuss when we should require a non-refundable security deposit.

1620
02:19:52,084 --> 02:19:55,386
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it would be, we didn't have Mr. Maloney there.

1621
02:19:55,466 --> 02:19:59,048
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that would be very helpful to have that discussion.

1622
02:19:59,948 --> 02:20:00,329
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

1623
02:20:00,349 --> 02:20:00,709
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1624
02:20:01,829 --> 02:20:08,473
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to clarify changing the word from rentals to usage because the high school teams don't rent it.

1625
02:20:09,183 --> 02:20:13,366
[SPEAKER_16]: And even though you schedule it, you schedule it through for the commission.

1626
02:20:14,026 --> 02:20:16,327
[SPEAKER_16]: So you're not doing it as your athletic director.

1627
02:20:16,347 --> 02:20:20,910
[SPEAKER_16]: You're doing it as whatever other hat you're wearing at that moment, right?

1628
02:20:21,170 --> 02:20:27,614
[SPEAKER_16]: So I wanted you still to be able to schedule that for usage with no monies attached.

1629
02:20:28,015 --> 02:20:30,876
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's why I wanted- For Hormel?

1630
02:20:30,996 --> 02:20:31,697
[SPEAKER_16]: For Hormel.

1631
02:20:32,377 --> 02:20:33,278
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't discuss Hormel.

1632
02:20:33,318 --> 02:20:34,158
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to go before the commission.

1633
02:20:34,178 --> 02:20:34,779
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the commission.

1634
02:20:35,546 --> 02:20:36,926
[SPEAKER_12]: You have no authority over Hormel.

1635
02:20:37,127 --> 02:20:37,627
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody does.

1636
02:20:37,647 --> 02:20:40,688
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we're putting a blurb in about it.

1637
02:20:41,228 --> 02:20:46,370
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just saying nobody, you have to, anybody who wants to rent Hormel other than going through me.

1638
02:20:46,470 --> 02:20:47,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Or use it.

1639
02:20:47,190 --> 02:20:50,431
[SPEAKER_12]: For Relay for Life, they come, they go before the commission.

1640
02:20:50,931 --> 02:20:53,252
[SPEAKER_12]: They sit with Jack Buckley, the commission votes.

1641
02:20:53,932 --> 02:20:57,053
[SPEAKER_12]: They tell me, take care of like Relay for Life's down there in a couple of weeks.

1642
02:20:57,613 --> 02:21:02,095
[SPEAKER_12]: I know everybody's a part of, it's a great cause, but Hormel Commission, they're in charge of it.

1643
02:21:05,610 --> 02:21:06,951
[SPEAKER_13]: We recognize that completely.

1644
02:21:07,011 --> 02:21:21,173
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason for putting in a statement which said Hormel Stadium rentals are controlled by the Hormel Commission contact information is so that people who are looking online would get to that because they're trying to rent Hormel and they would see in our document.

1645
02:21:21,193 --> 02:21:28,995
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, so we just really put that as a direction so that you wouldn't be flooded with questions or that somebody would know.

1646
02:21:29,335 --> 02:21:30,815
[SPEAKER_13]: It was really a courtesy quite honestly.

1647
02:21:31,223 --> 02:21:32,103
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate it.

1648
02:21:32,123 --> 02:21:51,308
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing you're going to realize is I would think you might want to invite Jack Buckley to that meeting because if you change the fees at Edgeley Field to $185 and Hormel stays at $145, people are going to be knocking down Hormel's doors before they want to rent Edgeley.

1649
02:21:51,668 --> 02:21:52,789
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a good thing in the city.

1650
02:21:52,829 --> 02:21:53,869
[SPEAKER_12]: We have three great fields.

1651
02:21:54,791 --> 02:22:00,312
[SPEAKER_12]: And the one thing gets tiresome up here is Somerville this, Everett this, Winchester that.

1652
02:22:00,793 --> 02:22:03,553
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to understand that we have three turf fields right now.

1653
02:22:04,053 --> 02:22:05,854
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going every night to 11 o'clock.

1654
02:22:06,614 --> 02:22:09,075
[SPEAKER_12]: They're going Saturdays and Sundays, 8 to 4.

1655
02:22:09,735 --> 02:22:10,015
[SPEAKER_12]: Why?

1656
02:22:10,035 --> 02:22:13,396
[SPEAKER_12]: The price is right and the fields are in great shape.

1657
02:22:14,036 --> 02:22:17,777
[SPEAKER_12]: Winchester's coming online in a couple weeks with a brand new field.

1658
02:22:18,657 --> 02:22:22,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Somerville charges the athletic department for practices.

1659
02:22:23,316 --> 02:22:25,018
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't want to hear about Somerville.

1660
02:22:25,118 --> 02:22:26,138
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a great thing here.

1661
02:22:26,859 --> 02:22:35,146
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, you need to consider if you're going to jack the prices at Edgeley, you may want to have the Hormel Commission there so everybody's on the same page.

1662
02:22:35,827 --> 02:22:36,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

1663
02:22:37,628 --> 02:22:42,072
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1664
02:22:43,333 --> 02:22:49,278
[SPEAKER_16]: I really appreciate your perspective and your knowledge about what the rates are now and all of that.

1665
02:22:50,717 --> 02:23:01,909
[SPEAKER_16]: I also agree that both fields should be on the same level in understanding so that way one doesn't get overused or another or waitlisted.

1666
02:23:02,329 --> 02:23:03,250
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree wholeheartedly.

1667
02:23:03,290 --> 02:23:07,134
[SPEAKER_16]: So I agree that Mr. Buckley should probably be at that meeting as well.

1668
02:23:08,195 --> 02:23:10,637
[SPEAKER_16]: My only concern is keeping the prices low.

1669
02:23:12,088 --> 02:23:16,111
[SPEAKER_16]: I did see the budget for Edgeley Field, and it hasn't come up on the agenda yet.

1670
02:23:16,391 --> 02:23:17,272
[SPEAKER_16]: And we will get there.

1671
02:23:17,792 --> 02:23:26,538
[SPEAKER_16]: But last year, we were $95,000 in the red for that field because of the bond and the interest on the bond.

1672
02:23:26,959 --> 02:23:31,262
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that that has to come in play somehow with usage.

1673
02:23:31,662 --> 02:23:35,785
[SPEAKER_16]: And this might not be the time when we get further into our agenda for the evening.

1674
02:23:36,165 --> 02:23:37,286
[SPEAKER_16]: We will discuss that.

1675
02:23:38,629 --> 02:23:43,670
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that that has been rectified with the payment from the city, so we're not in the red any longer.

1676
02:23:44,071 --> 02:23:47,031
[SPEAKER_16]: But we will get there, and we'll discuss all these issues.

1677
02:23:47,351 --> 02:23:51,273
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's my only concern of keeping the rates too low.

1678
02:23:52,073 --> 02:23:56,374
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to be able to maintain these without going to the taxpayers.

1679
02:23:57,714 --> 02:23:58,695
[SPEAKER_16]: And we can't.

1680
02:23:58,995 --> 02:24:03,516
[SPEAKER_16]: As a school committee, we have to figure out a plan to move forward to make sure we're in.

1681
02:24:03,636 --> 02:24:05,196
[SPEAKER_16]: The bubble might be the answer to that.

1682
02:24:07,610 --> 02:24:08,991
[SPEAKER_16]: I do appreciate what you're saying.

1683
02:24:09,651 --> 02:24:10,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1684
02:24:11,693 --> 02:24:13,014
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to approve file.

1685
02:24:13,514 --> 02:24:16,776
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to approve the file, excluding the fee schedule.

1686
02:24:17,957 --> 02:24:18,557
[SPEAKER_18]: As amended.

1687
02:24:20,338 --> 02:24:20,778
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Ms.

1688
02:24:20,798 --> 02:24:21,079
[SPEAKER_18]: Kretz.

1689
02:24:21,119 --> 02:24:25,021
[SPEAKER_03]: These are just like some minor updates on page two.

1690
02:24:25,562 --> 02:24:29,164
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just missing a word, like right here under the bullet one, two, three.

1691
02:24:29,805 --> 02:24:33,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Third bullet down, renters must, it's just missing the word E, 21.

1692
02:24:34,446 --> 02:24:47,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And then down below, a little bit further, I thought it was going to be new individuals will be admitted to the school building before or after an adult supervisor who must be at least 21 years of age.

1693
02:24:48,170 --> 02:24:56,472
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was gonna be 21 years of age, but it says 18 years in one section, but 21 in another.

1694
02:25:03,501 --> 02:25:07,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it just needs to be changed on the bullet on the bullet.

1695
02:25:07,325 --> 02:25:07,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1696
02:25:08,986 --> 02:25:09,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Two of the bullets.

1697
02:25:10,588 --> 02:25:12,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Second one from the bottom.

1698
02:25:14,151 --> 02:25:14,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Are there any other?

1699
02:25:14,912 --> 02:25:18,655
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I didn't see any others.

1700
02:25:22,138 --> 02:25:23,900
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

1701
02:25:24,861 --> 02:25:25,581
[SPEAKER_18]: It was a motion.

1702
02:25:25,862 --> 02:25:28,184
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll wait for him to get back.

1703
02:25:33,671 --> 02:25:39,347
[SPEAKER_18]: Take a two minute recess?

1704
02:25:39,708 --> 02:25:39,929
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1705
02:27:49,988 --> 02:27:51,049
I videoed them.

1706
02:27:51,109 --> 02:27:51,269
Good.

1707
02:27:51,389 --> 02:27:51,730
Yeah.

1708
02:28:21,838 --> 02:28:26,259
That'd be neat.

1709
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:31,360
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be fabulous.

1710
02:28:33,320 --> 02:28:34,501
[SPEAKER_18]: They were amazing.

1711
02:28:35,581 --> 02:28:37,281
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, amazing.

1712
02:28:37,321 --> 02:28:42,742
[SPEAKER_17]: Wish I had the whole thing.

1713
02:28:43,242 --> 02:28:48,563
[SPEAKER_20]: Probably that's a little too big.

1714
02:28:48,603 --> 02:28:48,663
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1715
02:28:58,795 --> 02:29:00,296
That's okay.

1716
02:29:00,436 --> 02:29:02,978
Is everybody here?

1717
02:29:02,998 --> 02:29:03,298
Let's see.

1718
02:29:28,782 --> 02:29:30,363
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I don't see her.

1719
02:29:30,523 --> 02:29:34,186
[SPEAKER_17]: No, Mia, and we're missing Scary.

1720
02:30:12,154 --> 02:30:13,675
[SPEAKER_18]: The meeting is called to session.

1721
02:30:15,056 --> 02:30:18,218
[SPEAKER_18]: We just lost another one.

1722
02:30:22,994 --> 02:30:23,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Another one.

1723
02:30:24,737 --> 02:30:27,502
[SPEAKER_18]: Done, done, done.

1724
02:30:27,522 --> 02:30:31,549
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what happens after three hours.

1725
02:31:00,139 --> 02:31:02,788
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't do the two changes on page two.

1726
02:32:47,668 --> 02:33:02,733
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion that the facilities rental agreement as amended on the floor be accepted, excluding the fee structure, and a committee of the whole will be called in the very near future to discuss that with our youth groups in the community and the Hormel Commission as well.

02:33:39,359 --> 02:33:40,500
[SPEAKER_18]: Subcommittee or committee at all?

1733
02:33:41,140 --> 02:33:46,682
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion to send the fee schedule to subcommittee to hold a hearing and a meeting in the very near future.

[SPEAKER_23]: She's distributed some additional materials.

1742
02:34:12,452 --> 02:34:17,675
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a lot of exciting things going on in our vocational school, and she's here to tell you about some of them.

1743
02:34:19,776 --> 02:34:23,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Superintendent Belson, Mayor Burke, and school committee.

1744
02:34:24,199 --> 02:34:29,121
[SPEAKER_08]: I will be quick because my colleagues over here are forcing me to be quick.

1745
02:34:31,362 --> 02:34:31,983
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

1746
02:34:32,003 --> 02:34:32,443
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not.

1747
02:34:32,483 --> 02:34:32,803
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not.

1748
02:34:33,464 --> 02:34:38,928
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are very excited to have two national qualifiers for our SkillsUSA competition.

1749
02:34:39,569 --> 02:34:48,216
[SPEAKER_08]: This year we have a second qualifier, Sukaran Saji, who is a senior in our graphic communications program.

02:34:48,836 --> 02:34:56,062
[SPEAKER_08]: He placed gold at the state competition in Marlborough in April, and he will be moving on to the national competition.

1751
02:34:56,725 --> 02:35:02,467
[SPEAKER_08]: The second person is Karan Debel, who is a junior in our Construction and Craft Laborers Program.

1752
02:35:02,887 --> 02:35:13,570
[SPEAKER_08]: He qualified as a Massachusetts State Officer, and he will be representing not only Medford Vocational Technical High School, but also the state of Massachusetts and SkillsUSA at this conference.

1753
02:35:14,311 --> 02:35:25,074
[SPEAKER_08]: At this time, I am requesting approval for us to be able to attend pending funding to the National SkillsUSA competition that will be held in Kentucky.

1754
02:35:26,023 --> 02:35:28,844

[SPEAKER_18]: Vander Kloot?

1759
02:35:40,067 --> 02:35:41,388
[SPEAKER_13]: What's the projected cost?

1760
02:35:42,308 --> 02:35:44,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Each student costs approximately $1,600, which includes airfare,

1761
02:35:47,217 --> 02:35:52,978
[SPEAKER_08]: evening at the hotel, as well as registration into the conference, and then the advisor of $1,600.

1762
02:35:53,058 --> 02:35:55,979
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's approximately $4,800.

1763
02:35:56,059 --> 02:36:00,700
[SPEAKER_08]: We do plan to do as much fundraising as we can in order to support this.

1764
02:36:01,700 --> 02:36:07,741
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you were successful last year, and I'm sure that we'll see some of your fundraising that we can help support.

1765
02:36:08,882 --> 02:36:12,763
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to invite both students here to commend them for their achievement.

1766
02:36:13,363 --> 02:36:14,483
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really fantastic.

1767
02:36:16,043 --> 02:36:18,224
[SPEAKER_18]: And the achievement may not be over yet.

1768
02:36:18,604 --> 02:36:19,105
[SPEAKER_13]: It may not.

1769
02:36:19,525 --> 02:36:20,205
[SPEAKER_18]: Hopefully.

1770
02:36:21,326 --> 02:36:21,706
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

1771
02:36:22,847 --> 02:36:23,387

[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1778
02:36:30,871 --> 02:36:31,411
[SPEAKER_18]: Likewise.

[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion for approval to send the students to the competition in Louisville, seconded by Mr. Benedetto, roll call vote.

1780
02:36:39,395 --> 02:36:39,435
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1781
02:36:40,116 --> 02:36:40,376
[SPEAKER_19]: de Leon.

1782
02:36:40,436 --> 02:36:40,556
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1783
02:36:40,576 --> 02:36:40,636
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1784
02:36:41,036 --> 02:36:41,636
[SPEAKER_19]: Benedetto.

1785
02:36:41,716 --> 02:36:41,957
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1786
02:36:41,977 --> 02:36:42,017
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1787
02:36:42,197 --> 02:36:42,337
[SPEAKER_19]: Ratz.

1788
02:36:42,357 --> 02:36:42,437
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1789
02:36:43,097 --> 02:36:43,798
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Stone.

1790
02:36:43,838 --> 02:36:43,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1791
02:36:43,918 --> 02:36:43,958
[SPEAKER_19]: Ms.

1792
02:36:43,978 --> 02:36:44,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Kering.

1793
02:36:44,118 --> 02:36:44,178
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1794
02:36:46,084 --> 02:36:48,325
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, 6, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

1795
02:36:48,345 --> 02:36:49,025
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

1796
02:36:52,807 --> 02:36:55,309
[SPEAKER_18]: Teen Dating Violence Prevention Grant.

1797
02:36:55,609 --> 02:36:55,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1798
02:36:55,829 --> 02:36:56,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Ritchie.

1799
02:36:56,549 --> 02:36:56,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1800
02:36:57,330 --> 02:37:01,772
[SPEAKER_08]: The second component of my report is the Teen Dating Violence Grant.

1801
02:37:01,812 --> 02:37:04,413
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a collaborative effort with Medford High School.

1802
02:37:04,944 --> 02:37:18,311
[SPEAKER_08]: in Medford Vocational Technical High School, and it was co-written by some of my colleagues behind me, Tony Vento, Jill Sawyer, Rachel Perry, myself, as well as Stacey Shulman, who is an adjustment counselor.

1803
02:37:18,752 --> 02:37:27,676
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a $10,000 grant to reduce risks, or high risks, of not only females, but also males in teen dating violence.

1804
02:37:28,177 --> 02:37:33,960
[SPEAKER_08]: We believe this to be an extremely important component of our high school curriculum as our students

1805
02:37:34,440 --> 02:37:37,081
[SPEAKER_08]: enter into adulthood and need to make difficult choices.

1806
02:37:37,842 --> 02:38:00,253
[SPEAKER_08]: The grant proposal, which I can certainly forward you, the one that we did get approved, is a $10,000 grant over the course of three years and we will be developing a mentoring program as well as other curriculum that hopefully the students are able to be so confident in themselves that they do not get into a situation of teen dating violence.

1807
02:38:00,848 --> 02:38:04,981
[SPEAKER_18]: Congratulations on receiving that grant and to the whole team that put the grant application in.

1808
02:38:06,285 --> 02:38:07,065
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

1809
02:38:07,366 --> 02:38:07,746
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1810
02:38:08,486 --> 02:38:22,012
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that this is a great program, and I know that the PTA up at the high school vocational school used to bring in a program called the Yellow Dress and present that.

1811
02:38:22,372 --> 02:38:24,153
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure if they're still doing that.

1812
02:38:24,193 --> 02:38:27,034
[SPEAKER_16]: They used to rotate each year, whether or not.

1813
02:38:27,515 --> 02:38:32,597
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that the head of the PTA, Ann Rapucci, is retiring.

1814
02:38:35,400 --> 02:38:46,450
[SPEAKER_16]: And so you might want to, maybe we could check in with her and see if they just want to continue that program or help you with this program and help fund it in that way as well.

1815
02:38:46,871 --> 02:38:47,191
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

1816
02:38:47,391 --> 02:38:52,736
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that this grant really specifies is that it's not a one-shot deal for presentations.

1817
02:38:54,303 --> 02:38:55,243
[SPEAKER_08]: longer term.

1818
02:38:55,323 --> 02:38:58,844
[SPEAKER_08]: So they begin in grade 9 and then move all the way through to grade 12.

1819
02:38:58,904 --> 02:39:05,646
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's really an embedded curriculum that goes across all content areas within the high school and the vocational high school.

1820
02:39:05,686 --> 02:39:08,467
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be one component, would be to bring in a guest speaker.

1821
02:39:08,987 --> 02:39:12,548
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's, yes, one component of the entire grant process.

1822
02:39:12,568 --> 02:39:13,148
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

1823
02:39:13,228 --> 02:39:14,028
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll reach out to her.

1824
02:39:14,329 --> 02:39:14,589
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1825
02:39:14,749 --> 02:39:15,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1826
02:39:15,509 --> 02:39:16,509
[SPEAKER_18]: Who awarded the grant?

1827
02:39:17,669 --> 02:39:18,050
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry?

1828
02:39:18,310 --> 02:39:19,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Who did you receive the grant from?

1829
02:39:19,710 --> 02:39:22,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

1830
02:39:23,031 --> 02:39:23,311
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1831
02:39:25,020 --> 02:39:25,160
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

1832
02:39:25,180 --> 02:39:28,262
[SPEAKER_18]: Van de Kloop.

1833
02:39:28,402 --> 02:39:29,162
[SPEAKER_13]: It's terrific.

1834
02:39:29,682 --> 02:39:30,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much, Heidi.

1835
02:39:31,223 --> 02:39:31,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1836
02:39:32,584 --> 02:39:32,984
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1837
02:39:33,584 --> 02:39:36,666
[SPEAKER_18]: Bunker Hill Community College Collaboration and Dual Enrollment.

1838
02:39:37,649 --> 02:39:53,279
[SPEAKER_08]: So the next exciting part is, again, another collaboration between Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School is that, come fall, we are offering an EMR adult ed program in the evening, but also an EMT certification program.

1839
02:39:53,359 --> 02:39:58,383
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a collaboration with Armstrong Ambulance, as well as Bunker Hill Community College.

1840
02:39:59,134 --> 02:40:12,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Where the high school and the vocational school comes in is that they are also offering us a four credit dual enrollment course that will be offered during the school day for both high school students and Medford vocational high school students.

1841
02:40:13,277 --> 02:40:18,338
[SPEAKER_08]: So upon completion of this course, they will have been certified as an emergency medical responder.

1842
02:40:18,878 --> 02:40:25,920
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a requirement if a graduate goes into the military, becomes a firefighter or any sort of civil service,

1843
02:40:27,100 --> 02:40:28,881
[SPEAKER_08]: as well as an EMT and paramedic.

1844
02:40:28,921 --> 02:40:33,905
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a precursor to the EMT and paramedic program that is also offered at Bunker Hill.

1845
02:40:33,985 --> 02:40:39,328
[SPEAKER_08]: So they will receive, at no cost to them, four credits towards that certification.

1846
02:40:39,348 --> 02:40:40,849
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

1847
02:40:40,869 --> 02:40:41,469
[SPEAKER_18]: Excellent.

1848
02:40:42,090 --> 02:40:42,490
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

1849
02:40:42,530 --> 02:40:42,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep on going.

1850
02:40:44,331 --> 02:40:44,771
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.

1851
02:40:46,437 --> 02:40:49,359
[SPEAKER_18]: MTHS Connect and CareerSource of Cambridge.

1852
02:40:50,299 --> 02:41:03,027
[SPEAKER_08]: So we did report on this, but it is finalized where the Connect CareerSource with a collaborative grant, and we are a vendor of that grant, so we don't actually receive the grant funding.

1853
02:41:03,087 --> 02:41:04,568
[SPEAKER_08]: What we do is we receive

1854
02:41:05,128 --> 02:41:10,533
[SPEAKER_08]: funds to be able to teach the program at Medford Technical Institute.

1855
02:41:10,953 --> 02:41:12,255
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an adult ed program.

1856
02:41:12,415 --> 02:41:15,217
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a pilot program for the Commonwealth Corporation.

1857
02:41:15,297 --> 02:41:21,883
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're familiar with the Commonwealth Corporation, they do fund these types of workforce development and retraining.

1858
02:41:22,404 --> 02:41:25,186
[SPEAKER_08]: It is specifically targeted towards females,

1859
02:41:27,467 --> 02:41:36,793
[SPEAKER_08]: civilians that are newly retired or discharged military, as well as a diverse population.

1860
02:41:36,813 --> 02:41:43,077
[SPEAKER_08]: So whether it's students or adults that have English language as their second language.

1861
02:41:44,563 --> 02:41:48,905
[SPEAKER_08]: This is scheduled to be held starting the week of July 11th.

1862
02:41:49,345 --> 02:41:50,726
[SPEAKER_08]: It is an eight week program.

1863
02:41:51,266 --> 02:41:59,489
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're very excited to be able to offer this because the hopes is that if this becomes so successful, it is a pilot for the state of Massachusetts.

1864
02:42:00,210 --> 02:42:10,354
[SPEAKER_08]: We were the only ones that did receive this and they would like to see what the outcome is of this, of those 15 graduates or participants in order to then fund additional.

1865
02:42:10,774 --> 02:42:14,196
[SPEAKER_08]: It is specifically related to the construction and carpentry trades.

1866
02:42:15,100 --> 02:42:16,661
[SPEAKER_18]: who will be conducting the training?

1867
02:42:18,401 --> 02:42:27,485
[SPEAKER_08]: It will be done by a variety of sources because the individual will receive the construction OSHA 10-hour card, so that will be done by an OSHA trainer.

1868
02:42:28,125 --> 02:42:35,368
[SPEAKER_08]: They will also receive CPR and first aid, which will be done by a trained CPR and first aid associate.

1869
02:42:36,004 --> 02:42:43,729
[SPEAKER_08]: and then a carpentry and construction trainer as well that has to be certified in order to use the equipment, et cetera.

1870
02:42:43,949 --> 02:42:54,156
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have posted this position internally because our goal is to hire staff internally as they will be taking care of the property of Medford Public Schools.

1871
02:42:57,274 --> 02:42:57,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

1872
02:42:57,474 --> 02:42:57,834
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuno?

1873
02:42:58,874 --> 02:43:01,615
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to ask about the CPR course.

1874
02:43:02,175 --> 02:43:03,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's part of the course.

1875
02:43:04,156 --> 02:43:07,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Will the students have options of getting certified?

1876
02:43:08,357 --> 02:43:08,777
[SPEAKER_08]: They will.

1877
02:43:09,037 --> 02:43:15,399
[SPEAKER_08]: So upon completion, they will get their first aid CPR certification as well as their OSHA construction card.

1878
02:43:16,203 --> 02:43:23,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of these types of programs, how they deem it to be successful is by having a credential attached to it.

1879
02:43:23,789 --> 02:43:31,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are the types of credentials that are needed in the construction and building trades, and therefore they will have received that certification.

1880
02:43:32,115 --> 02:43:33,756
[SPEAKER_14]: And is there any other fee?

1881
02:43:34,237 --> 02:43:41,503
[SPEAKER_14]: adjacent to it, like I know the boys, I mean, it's a different thing, but I know my boys just took a CPOC course through our school.

1882
02:43:41,984 --> 02:43:45,387
[SPEAKER_14]: But to get certified and for their certification, they had to pay a fee.

1883
02:43:45,747 --> 02:43:46,728
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not sure if there's anything.

1884
02:43:46,748 --> 02:44:00,579
[SPEAKER_08]: So this adult ed program is being paid for by the Commonwealth Corporation because it is a retraining grant in order to retrain under or unemployed individuals within the greater Boston community.

1885
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:01,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1886
02:44:01,781 --> 02:44:02,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1887
02:44:04,271 --> 02:44:05,732
[SPEAKER_18]: recent grant applications?

1888
02:44:05,752 --> 02:44:07,392
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you want to just hit on them?

1889
02:44:08,133 --> 02:44:21,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, basically so that you know that our school is working very hard and diligently looking for alternative funding sources as we continue to expand our career and technical education programs.

1890
02:44:21,919 --> 02:44:26,901
[SPEAKER_08]: We do feel it necessary to make sure that we're meeting industry demands, and with that comes equipment.

1891
02:44:27,502 --> 02:44:37,126
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have collectively and collaboratively, again with the high school, as well as our colleagues, have applied for multiple grant opportunities.

1892
02:44:37,566 --> 02:44:46,209
[SPEAKER_08]: The first being the CTE makeover challenge grant, and Molly Layden, who I think is still behind us, has helped me write this grant.

1893
02:44:46,369 --> 02:44:49,510
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a two-phase process, so we're in the second phase.

1894
02:44:49,570 --> 02:44:54,932
[SPEAKER_08]: We did make it to the second round of that grant application, and we'll be submitting by the end of this week.

1895
02:44:55,652 --> 02:45:04,735
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have to say that Kathy Kretz, as a member of our advisory board, has reviewed the grant application and provided feedback, so I would like to thank her for that.

1896
02:45:05,665 --> 02:45:09,788
[SPEAKER_08]: The second grant application is from the Auto Collision and Repair Education Foundation.

1897
02:45:09,828 --> 02:45:11,469
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a makeover grant.

1898
02:45:11,929 --> 02:45:16,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of these grants you have to reapply because you may not get it the first time.

1899
02:45:16,432 --> 02:45:25,919
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't get it last year, but we did get feedback, so we're hoping to strengthen our application process, and we will be submitting that grant application in the next two weeks.

1900
02:45:27,293 --> 02:45:41,242
[SPEAKER_08]: With the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, and as you know, in vocational education, it's pretty hot in the state of Massachusetts, and making sure that all students are prepared not only for college, but also for their career, even beyond college.

1901
02:45:42,203 --> 02:45:48,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Therefore, the Department of Education has submitted an RFP for $10,000 of a planning grant.

1902
02:45:48,847 --> 02:45:55,332
[SPEAKER_08]: That planning grant is going to be extremely important for us to get this planning grant, because it is a precursor to

1903
02:45:55,872 --> 02:45:59,974
[SPEAKER_08]: a much larger grant of $150,000 in equipment.

1904
02:46:00,694 --> 02:46:08,078
[SPEAKER_08]: And so in order to be able to write that second phase of that grant, you have to have received this $10,000 grant.

1905
02:46:08,858 --> 02:46:15,882
[SPEAKER_08]: We sat into a webinar last week, and there are 120 schools that were listening to this webinar, and they are only giving out $10,000.

1906
02:46:17,435 --> 02:46:19,356
[SPEAKER_08]: planning grants of $10,000.

1907
02:46:19,556 --> 02:46:21,597
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's extremely competitive.

1908
02:46:21,837 --> 02:46:23,438
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not sure if we're going to get it.

1909
02:46:23,898 --> 02:46:26,879
[SPEAKER_08]: But one thing that we are looking for is partnerships.

1910
02:46:27,380 --> 02:46:38,505
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just going to really quickly list off that the Metro North Regional Employment Board, Bunker Hill Community College, Comcast, Wynn Boston Harbor, State Representative Barber,

1911
02:46:40,366 --> 02:46:44,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Light Cyber, which is an Internet securities firm.

1912
02:46:44,748 --> 02:46:58,275
[SPEAKER_08]: The Furniture Trust and Congresswoman Clark have all reached out and given us letters of support for this grant, and there will be additional grant fundings, as you see in your other packet here from the Massachusetts Business Roundtable.

1913
02:46:58,755 --> 02:47:11,801
[SPEAKER_08]: is that Governor Baker, they did pass an act with approximately $75 million in funding that is going to target specifically vocational education, which may also be in the community college level as well and career pathways.

1914
02:47:12,362 --> 02:47:19,265
[SPEAKER_08]: But the nice part about us being housed in the same complex as the high school is that they are looking at creative ways to increase

1915
02:47:19,905 --> 02:47:23,008
[SPEAKER_08]: opportunities in technical education in comprehensive high schools.

1916
02:47:23,488 --> 02:47:24,609
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yes.

1917
02:47:25,109 --> 02:47:25,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

1918
02:47:25,289 --> 02:47:25,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Vandekloot.

1919
02:47:25,950 --> 02:47:27,671
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Heidi, I know you like a challenge.

1920
02:47:28,172 --> 02:47:29,833
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is a pretty great challenge.

1921
02:47:29,893 --> 02:47:30,894
[SPEAKER_13]: This is fantastic.

1922
02:47:31,174 --> 02:47:31,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Good luck.

1923
02:47:31,794 --> 02:47:32,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1924
02:47:35,397 --> 02:47:38,640
[SPEAKER_18]: And the last item is a New York Times article.

1925
02:47:39,741 --> 02:47:40,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm sorry, Ms.

1926
02:47:40,421 --> 02:47:40,882
[SPEAKER_18]: Kritz.

1927
02:47:41,302 --> 02:47:45,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say congratulations, Heidi, on qualifying to the next level.

1928
02:47:46,226 --> 02:47:47,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what a big deal it is.

1929
02:47:47,307 --> 02:47:48,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1930
02:47:48,067 --> 02:47:48,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

1931
02:47:49,729 --> 02:47:49,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure.

1932
02:47:49,969 --> 02:47:55,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a way that we can publicize that we're looking for, industry level?

1933
02:47:55,873 --> 02:48:03,639
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, might there be other businesses you particularly want to attract?

1934
02:48:04,039 --> 02:48:17,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I think since this is publicized and all of you being community members, it will be really essential that anyone that's listening that feels as though they have a presence, this particular grant that we are writing,

1935
02:48:17,608 --> 02:48:33,467
[SPEAKER_08]: is going to focus on all technology-based programs, which includes TV production, media technology, computer programming and web development, marketing, business technology, graphic communications, design and visual, and information technology.

1936
02:48:33,507 --> 02:48:35,329
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're looking at really creating this hub.

1937
02:48:35,874 --> 02:48:43,058
[SPEAKER_08]: or this epicenter or innovation center, and robotics and engineering, where they're all kind of working together towards a common purpose.

1938
02:48:43,278 --> 02:48:51,463
[SPEAKER_08]: So if anybody out there is listening and definitely has a field of interest, certainly, and we can, I think Allison's still here.

1939
02:48:51,543 --> 02:48:52,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, she left.

1940
02:48:52,284 --> 02:48:58,067
[SPEAKER_08]: So Allison Goldsberry can also post it on our website, and we can have Lisa post it in the blog as well.

1941
02:48:59,468 --> 02:49:00,889
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you consider Tufts University?

1942
02:49:01,710 --> 02:49:05,431
[SPEAKER_08]: We do actually have Tufts University, but we're waiting for their letter, yes.

1943
02:49:05,591 --> 02:49:08,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't want to put them until, but thank you.

1944
02:49:12,113 --> 02:49:14,113
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly, the New York Times article.

1945
02:49:15,634 --> 02:49:22,976
[SPEAKER_08]: The last exciting part is that I think you all know Isaac Cardoso, who is a state officer with Massachusetts SkillsUSA.

1946
02:49:23,496 --> 02:49:30,998
[SPEAKER_08]: He will be graduating in just a couple of weeks, but he is also going to the national conference that is being paid for by SkillsUSA.

1947
02:49:31,787 --> 02:49:39,872
[SPEAKER_08]: He was reached out to us by the New York Times because they're doing a story on vocational education across the nation.

1948
02:49:40,412 --> 02:49:48,417
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were looking for somebody that is going directly into the trades in some way through an apprenticeship program upon high school completion.

1949
02:49:50,138 --> 02:49:54,640
[SPEAKER_08]: We were approached by the state director of Massachusetts SkillsUSA.

1950
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:55,821
[SPEAKER_08]: So he was selected.

1951
02:49:57,613 --> 02:50:04,376
[SPEAKER_08]: one person in the entire nation to be represented as being a successful model for vocational education.

1952
02:50:05,017 --> 02:50:16,663
[SPEAKER_08]: We are very fortunate to have him also receive the IBEW Local 103 Scholarship, and so he will be entering IBEW in the summer.

1953
02:50:19,022 --> 02:50:21,604
[SPEAKER_13]: So one of my friends said to me, did you see the Times?

1954
02:50:22,784 --> 02:50:26,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you know that the Medford Vocational School is featured in it?

1955
02:50:26,126 --> 02:50:28,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Which I didn't, and I still haven't seen it.

1956
02:50:28,427 --> 02:50:30,308
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you have a copy of the article?

1957
02:50:30,328 --> 02:50:32,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you have it actually.

1958
02:50:32,149 --> 02:50:33,030
[SPEAKER_13]: I could not find it.

1959
02:50:33,910 --> 02:50:35,371
[SPEAKER_18]: They just circulated them earlier.

1960
02:50:35,851 --> 02:50:36,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1961
02:50:37,112 --> 02:50:37,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-huh.

1962
02:50:37,832 --> 02:50:38,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

1963
02:50:38,633 --> 02:50:39,133
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

1964
02:50:39,233 --> 02:50:39,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1965
02:50:39,533 --> 02:50:43,475
[SPEAKER_08]: It was also posted in our blog as well over the weekend.

1966
02:50:43,555 --> 02:50:45,676
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a pretty cool article.

1967
02:50:46,277 --> 02:50:52,920
[SPEAKER_08]: And the picture, the New York Times actually came to the electrical shop last week and took the picture in our electrical shop.

1968
02:50:52,960 --> 02:50:54,841
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're pretty excited about that as well.

1969
02:50:54,861 --> 02:50:55,241
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderful.

1970
02:50:55,782 --> 02:50:56,482
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fabulous.

1971
02:50:57,182 --> 02:50:57,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto?

1972
02:50:58,683 --> 02:51:03,566
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to commend Isaac for his work through our school system.

1973
02:51:03,686 --> 02:51:06,147
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, he's represented Method well for a lot of years.

1974
02:51:06,642 --> 02:51:11,085
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember when he first started running for this seat.

1975
02:51:11,786 --> 02:51:17,630
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's just been a pleasure to watch him grow up and represent us in such a great way.

1976
02:51:17,790 --> 02:51:25,655
[SPEAKER_16]: And the mentoring that you and your staff have given to our vocational students is very impressive.

1977
02:51:26,216 --> 02:51:26,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1978
02:51:28,413 --> 02:51:29,393
[SPEAKER_18]: Nice presentation, Heidi.

1979
02:51:29,413 --> 02:51:30,033
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

1980
02:51:30,073 --> 02:51:32,434
[SPEAKER_18]: Is a motion to receive in place on file?

1981
02:51:32,454 --> 02:51:33,374
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to receive.

1982
02:51:34,314 --> 02:51:34,795
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion.

1983
02:51:34,815 --> 02:51:35,535
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

1984
02:51:36,515 --> 02:51:37,115
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

1985
02:51:37,155 --> 02:51:37,875
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

1986
02:51:38,756 --> 02:51:40,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Pre-budget report guidance.

1987
02:51:40,316 --> 02:51:48,258
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're going to call upon our guidance director, Amelia Jensen, to tell us about the guidance department.

1988
02:51:48,650 --> 02:51:52,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, good evening Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and members of the school committee.

1989
02:51:53,571 --> 02:51:58,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight I'm here to give you the pre-budget report for guidance, and I too will be very quick.

1990
02:51:59,113 --> 02:52:01,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give you an overview of the guidance department to start.

1991
02:52:02,013 --> 02:52:10,195
[SPEAKER_07]: So the guidance department currently consists of 10 counselors, five counselors at the high school, one at the vocational school, and two at each of the middle schools.

1992
02:52:11,276 --> 02:52:16,857
[SPEAKER_07]: The mission of the guidance department is to ensure that all students thrive in the three areas of college and career readiness,

1993
02:52:17,617 --> 02:52:20,500
[SPEAKER_07]: academic development, and social and emotional wellness.

1994
02:52:21,160 --> 02:52:25,664
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are the areas we base our curriculum, our programs, and our opportunities on.

1995
02:52:26,765 --> 02:52:42,518
[SPEAKER_07]: To deliver this counseling curriculum, the middle school counselors teach classes to students in all grades, and the high school counselors meet with students in a variety of ways, including the guidance seminars through the advisory program, as well as individual meetings and classroom pull-outs and collaboration.

1996
02:52:43,953 --> 02:52:50,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So our use of funding for the school year 2015-2016 was consistent with what was reported.

1997
02:52:50,995 --> 02:52:54,936
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks to that funding, we've had some major accomplishments this year.

1998
02:52:56,016 --> 02:53:01,478
[SPEAKER_07]: In the report, you'll see a list of many accomplishments, but I'm going to highlight three tonight.

1999
02:53:02,719 --> 02:53:05,942
[SPEAKER_07]: First, this year we had our first annual C3 Day.

2000
02:53:05,962 --> 02:53:13,249
[SPEAKER_07]: C3 Day was a day that was dedicated to college, career, and community service for the entire school.

2001
02:53:13,789 --> 02:53:20,736
[SPEAKER_07]: What we did is through the funding that you so graciously gave us last year, all of our juniors were able to take the PSAT free of charge.

2002
02:53:21,116 --> 02:53:27,417
[SPEAKER_07]: which really got them thinking about college, it helped prepare them for the SAT, and it really created a strong college-going culture.

2003
02:53:28,057 --> 02:53:37,539
[SPEAKER_07]: During that day, all seniors had the opportunity to participate in off-campus events regarding college, career, or community and civic experiences.

2004
02:53:38,179 --> 02:53:41,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Many students used this day to take college visits.

2005
02:53:42,380 --> 02:53:44,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Tufts University hosted a career panel.

2006
02:53:45,660 --> 02:53:48,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Students job shadowed did community service.

2007
02:53:48,881 --> 02:53:54,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Tufts also hosted an essay writing workshop on our school campus and there were many more opportunities.

2008
02:53:54,710 --> 02:53:58,476
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was an extremely successful event and we are looking forward to doing it again next year.

2009
02:53:59,848 --> 02:54:04,430
[SPEAKER_07]: The second major accomplishment was that we were able to advance our experiential learning.

2010
02:54:04,870 --> 02:54:07,771
[SPEAKER_07]: So last year we asked for an additional school counselor.

2011
02:54:08,571 --> 02:54:12,473
[SPEAKER_07]: We used that school counselor as our new school and community partnerships counselor.

2012
02:54:13,493 --> 02:54:22,816
[SPEAKER_07]: This position has made a huge difference for students because this person in this position has brought many opportunities to Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School students.

2013
02:54:24,850 --> 02:54:36,558
[SPEAKER_07]: One specific thing is that we were able to offer a Bunker Hill dual enrollment class on campus after school to junior and senior students, which was sociology free of charge for up to 30 students.

2014
02:54:36,898 --> 02:54:43,903
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking at expanding that next year and teaching more courses at school so students can get college and high school credit.

2015
02:54:46,344 --> 02:55:02,472
[SPEAKER_07]: This position was also able to connect over 300 students with community service opportunities, internships, and job placements by partnering with the community, with Tufts University, with the Medford Chamber of Commerce, with different businesses and organizations.

2016
02:55:04,005 --> 02:55:12,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Our third major accomplishment this year that I'm going to note tonight is that we were able to expand our social and emotional learning in the middle schools.

2017
02:55:12,669 --> 02:55:22,214
[SPEAKER_07]: So last year, the middle school counselors at the McGlynn Middle School were able to teach students all three grades in guidance classes.

2018
02:55:22,554 --> 02:55:32,099
[SPEAKER_07]: And this year, thanks to Mr. DeLeva and working with us in the scheduling, now the Andrews Middle School counselors also teach sixth, seventh, and eighth grade guidance classes.

2019
02:55:33,120 --> 02:55:46,201
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is really pushing forward our freshmen, I'm sorry, this is really pushing forward our students so when they become freshmen at the high school they're all in the same place socially and emotionally with our Michigan model curriculum.

2020
02:55:48,100 --> 02:55:59,967
[SPEAKER_07]: So for next year, our request for the school year 2016-2017, we're really looking at keeping level funding with our textbook and our PSAT accounts.

2021
02:56:00,768 --> 02:56:06,992
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're hoping to increase our office supplies by $300 to assist with materials needed for our advisory seminars.

2022
02:56:07,732 --> 02:56:15,955
[SPEAKER_07]: and increase our contractual services by $500, which would cover professional development related to two areas.

2023
02:56:16,235 --> 02:56:22,918
[SPEAKER_07]: One would be training the counselors in vocational education to further the integration process of the high school and the vocational school.

2024
02:56:23,398 --> 02:56:31,722
[SPEAKER_07]: And the other area would be with the ELL population, counseling them in regards to the transition after high school and college.

2025
02:56:32,002 --> 02:56:35,303
[SPEAKER_07]: There's very limited resources out there, so they need some additional training.

2026
02:56:37,649 --> 02:56:37,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2027
02:56:38,509 --> 02:56:38,850
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

2028
02:56:38,870 --> 02:56:39,930
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any questions?

2029
02:56:40,971 --> 02:56:41,131
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

2030
02:56:41,171 --> 02:56:42,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Cuneo, you're all set?

2031
02:56:43,232 --> 02:56:44,373
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I was going to ask the question.

2032
02:56:45,393 --> 02:56:45,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2033
02:56:45,794 --> 02:56:54,739
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to ask, first of all, the C3 day, as a parent, I liked it a lot.

2034
02:56:54,799 --> 02:56:56,800
[SPEAKER_14]: It gave me the opportunity with the boys to go and

2035
02:56:57,378 --> 02:57:01,020
[SPEAKER_14]: see a couple of more schools because it's difficult in everyone's schedule.

2036
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:01,741
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was great.

2037
02:57:02,321 --> 02:57:07,745
[SPEAKER_14]: And I also know that the feedback on that day was really good from a lot of students and parents.

2038
02:57:08,245 --> 02:57:16,591
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was a really nice way of thinking outside the box to make sure everybody was looked at instead of having some lull day that no one could do anything.

2039
02:57:17,891 --> 02:57:23,355
[SPEAKER_14]: I am looking, I'm looking at your goals and I like the idea

2040
02:57:24,518 --> 02:57:50,699
[SPEAKER_14]: including especially because I'm always afraid of the children that are getting not getting looked at when we're going from one to the other job like I'm you know elementary to the middle middle to the high school so that just makes so much sense the other thing I was going to ask you is I'm looking at the 2016 college acceptances oh yeah and again proud of our students of what they've done what they've accomplished with the help of everyone

2041
02:57:52,096 --> 02:58:00,482
[SPEAKER_14]: But I know that in the graduation book, on graduation day, it doesn't really say where the students were accepted to.

2042
02:58:00,902 --> 02:58:02,484
[SPEAKER_14]: It says where the students are going.

2043
02:58:03,244 --> 02:58:07,027
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know I had this feedback last year when parents were asking me,

2044
02:58:08,021 --> 02:58:14,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, you always say that the kids are getting accepted into all these different schools, but I'm not seeing any of these schools on the list.

2045
02:58:14,764 --> 02:58:30,529
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know, as many of us, because of the financial situation, some of the students are not selecting the schools that they really had been chosen to because financially it worked out better for their own personal financial situation to go somewhere else.

2046
02:58:31,050 --> 02:58:37,392
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm looking at the list, and I know for a fact we have a lot of students going up to UMass Lowell.

2047
02:58:38,075 --> 02:58:38,515
[SPEAKER_14]: this year.

2048
02:58:39,116 --> 02:58:50,043
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just somehow, if we could incorporate where the students have been accepted, not only to where they're going, because I just don't want the students need to get the credit for it.

2049
02:58:50,063 --> 02:58:55,967
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just don't want parents to look at the list and say, oh, there's five colleges here.

2050
02:58:55,987 --> 02:58:57,808
[SPEAKER_14]: This is all they've been accepted to.

2051
02:58:58,349 --> 02:59:01,331
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't think people understand that when they're reading it.

2052
02:59:01,671 --> 02:59:07,715
[SPEAKER_14]: So somehow, some way, if we could put that in the package of the booklet, I would appreciate it.

2053
02:59:08,318 --> 02:59:18,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, after we had spoken at that middle school college night, I had spoken with Dr. Perala and Lisa Bowler about creating the booklets to be different this year.

2054
02:59:18,783 --> 02:59:25,867
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to have both the colleges that students were accepted to, and then next to that, we'll have whether or not students are attending and how many.

2055
02:59:26,187 --> 02:59:26,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

2056
02:59:26,787 --> 02:59:27,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2057
02:59:27,128 --> 02:59:28,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.

2058
02:59:30,109 --> 02:59:30,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

2059
02:59:30,289 --> 02:59:31,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Vander Kloof?

2060
02:59:31,751 --> 02:59:43,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Amiya, since you mentioned the PSAT funding, I just wanted to ask you, are the AP tests funded, are they, does guidance organize those, or are they organized by department?

2061
02:59:43,480 --> 02:59:45,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so guidance organizes the AP exams.

2062
02:59:46,880 --> 02:59:52,904
[SPEAKER_13]: And do we provide any funding for AP students?

2063
02:59:53,364 --> 02:59:53,605
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2064
02:59:54,225 --> 02:59:58,087
[SPEAKER_07]: However, there are fee reductions for students who are on free and reduced lunch.

2065
02:59:58,167 --> 03:00:03,451
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe this year, if a student was on free or reduced lunch, they paid, I'd have to check, but it was somewhere between $13 and $15 per exam.

2066
03:00:07,052 --> 03:00:22,237
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I'm a little concerned that for a student taking multiple, I heard my students talking about this, who I oversee, and they were talking about if they were taking multiple tests, if they're not on free or reduced lunch, it's just so expensive.

2067
03:00:22,317 --> 03:00:25,798
[SPEAKER_13]: And somehow or another, I would really like to see some funding

2068
03:00:26,338 --> 03:00:30,539
[SPEAKER_13]: towards AP exams, because I think that it's such a great thing for our students.

2069
03:00:30,879 --> 03:00:32,220
[SPEAKER_13]: We like them doing well.

2070
03:00:32,880 --> 03:00:36,401
[SPEAKER_13]: But the funding is prohibitive for a lot of kids.

2071
03:00:36,841 --> 03:00:38,642
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to talk to you about that a little bit more.

2072
03:00:39,002 --> 03:00:43,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the exams are about, I think this year they were $92 per exam.

2073
03:00:43,323 --> 03:00:45,004
[SPEAKER_07]: And some students do take three or four.

2074
03:00:46,224 --> 03:00:51,686
[SPEAKER_07]: The majority of students take one to two, but we do have quite a few students who take three to four.

2075
03:00:51,766 --> 03:00:53,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe this year we had about 220 students taking AP

2076
03:00:56,147 --> 03:00:57,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, we had 220 exams.

2077
03:00:58,129 --> 03:00:59,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure the number of AP students.

2078
03:00:59,710 --> 03:01:00,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was around 140.

2079
03:01:00,610 --> 03:01:05,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I mean, it's a very expensive cost.

2080
03:01:05,994 --> 03:01:12,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the AP Italian exam is completely covered through an outside scholarship that Miss DiCarlo has secured.

2081
03:01:12,879 --> 03:01:19,343
[SPEAKER_07]: And then again, students who are on free and reduced lunch get the $15 per exam.

2082
03:01:19,363 --> 03:01:21,705
[SPEAKER_07]: But the rest of the students do have to pay the full price.

2083
03:01:22,205 --> 03:01:23,186
[SPEAKER_07]: which is pretty costly.

2084
03:01:24,206 --> 03:01:30,789
[SPEAKER_07]: I have researched what some other schools do, and I'm sorry I don't have it in front of me, but I could get it for you.

2085
03:01:31,189 --> 03:01:41,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that one school district up north, and I believe it's Woburn, but I could be wrong, is that they offer to pay for one AP exam per student, and then after that the students pay for it.

2086
03:01:41,974 --> 03:01:47,976
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know schools are out there kind of trying to explore it, but there are other schools that also take the stand that

2087
03:01:49,377 --> 03:01:58,243
[SPEAKER_07]: The AP exam is something that gives the students college credit, and therefore it's beyond high school, so they opt not to pay for that, whereas they do opt to pay for

2088
03:01:58,800 --> 03:02:03,223
[SPEAKER_07]: the PSAT because it helps prepare students to actually get into college.

2089
03:02:03,744 --> 03:02:11,009
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's some differing opinions out there, but there's definitely some models that I would be happy to give you information on if you're interested.

2090
03:02:11,169 --> 03:02:14,512
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the schools of the students told me that they pay for all of them.

2091
03:02:14,872 --> 03:02:15,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

2092
03:02:15,173 --> 03:02:16,293
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was really impressed.

2093
03:02:16,413 --> 03:02:19,536
[SPEAKER_13]: So anyway, I'd like to explore it a little bit more.

2094
03:02:19,896 --> 03:02:24,740
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's another budget item, but it's something we should think about.

2095
03:02:27,153 --> 03:02:27,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

2096
03:02:27,333 --> 03:02:27,753
[SPEAKER_17]: Krebs?

2097
03:02:28,174 --> 03:02:28,314
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

2098
03:02:28,514 --> 03:02:28,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.

2099
03:02:29,975 --> 03:02:34,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to know, because I know that the enrollment's going to go up a little bit in the vocational school.

2100
03:02:34,938 --> 03:02:37,479
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few more students joining the vocational school.

2101
03:02:37,919 --> 03:02:46,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that one guidance counselor would be enough, or there might be a need for an add to staff, or maybe 1.5?

2102
03:02:46,604 --> 03:02:53,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just noticing that the numbers were like the Anderson Middle School was two, McGlynn was two, the vocational school was one, and the high school was five.

2103
03:02:54,089 --> 03:02:56,090
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just kind of looking at the numbers that way.

2104
03:02:56,539 --> 03:02:58,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, well, we could always use more counselors.

2105
03:02:58,962 --> 03:03:03,167
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually, the middle, or the vocational school right now, I believe, has a population of around 200?

2106
03:03:03,208 --> 03:03:03,167
253.

2107
03:03:03,228 --> 03:03:05,991
[SPEAKER_07]: 253.

2108
03:03:03,288 --> 03:03:05,991
[SPEAKER_07]: For next year or for this year?

2109
03:03:10,553 --> 03:03:14,415
[SPEAKER_07]: This year, OK, has about 253 students this year.

2110
03:03:14,536 --> 03:03:18,378
[SPEAKER_07]: At the high school, the average counselor caseload is around 280.

2111
03:03:19,238 --> 03:03:19,899
[SPEAKER_07]: One counselor has 320.

2112
03:03:19,939 --> 03:03:22,000
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little off this year.

2113
03:03:23,121 --> 03:03:27,183
[SPEAKER_07]: So it depends on how many students do enter into the vocational school.

2114
03:03:27,243 --> 03:03:27,624
[SPEAKER_07]: What Ms.

2115
03:03:27,684 --> 03:03:38,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Riccio and I have been talking about, though, is that we plan on integrating the counseling staff, working towards that next year, with the following year hopefully having it fully integrated where

2116
03:03:39,411 --> 03:03:41,953
[SPEAKER_07]: every counselor would have a section of all students.

2117
03:03:42,033 --> 03:03:43,935
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would be more evenly distributed.

2118
03:03:44,255 --> 03:03:45,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2119
03:03:45,536 --> 03:03:46,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had one more question.

2120
03:03:47,138 --> 03:03:53,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Oh, I just wanted to know, um, who is, what is the name of the new community partnership counselor?

2121
03:03:53,723 --> 03:03:55,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, Mr. Tim Klein.

2122
03:03:55,685 --> 03:03:55,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

2123
03:03:56,746 --> 03:03:59,108
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew I met him, but I just couldn't remember his name.

2124
03:03:59,148 --> 03:03:59,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2125
03:03:59,889 --> 03:04:00,369
[SPEAKER_18]: You're welcome.

2126
03:04:01,063 --> 03:04:01,523
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2127
03:04:01,764 --> 03:04:02,524
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Benedetto.

2128
03:04:03,465 --> 03:04:04,506
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to comment.

2129
03:04:04,566 --> 03:04:10,850
[SPEAKER_16]: There's quite an extensive list of colleges that our students have been accepted to.

2130
03:04:11,631 --> 03:04:19,437
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a great accomplishment, not only to our high school educators, but to our kindergarten all the way through 12th grade.

2131
03:04:19,757 --> 03:04:29,524
[SPEAKER_16]: This shows that what we're doing is producing wonderful, wonderful educated children that are getting into schools throughout the country.

2132
03:04:31,235 --> 03:04:40,441
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, whether they're Ivy league or down the street, I think it's all, all a tribute to, to what they have learned throughout their, their educational thing.

2133
03:04:41,062 --> 03:04:51,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, this just brought up a reminder that, um, the school committee voted to have, um, some of our parents also on the stage.

2134
03:04:51,448 --> 03:04:59,634
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just wanted to remind the superintendent, I know spoke on the phone about it, about, um, some more, um, students being on the,

2135
03:05:00,044 --> 03:05:06,346
[SPEAKER_16]: And just to make sure that you touch base with all involved at our high school and vocational.

2136
03:05:06,886 --> 03:05:15,789
[SPEAKER_16]: I know they put the program together and make sure that they're made aware that Mrs. Rapucci and her son will also be present on stage for graduation.

2137
03:05:15,929 --> 03:05:19,970
[SPEAKER_16]: And notify them as well, because I don't think they've been notified yet.

2138
03:05:20,410 --> 03:05:22,931
[SPEAKER_16]: And moving onward reminded me of that.

2139
03:05:23,031 --> 03:05:23,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2140
03:05:23,772 --> 03:05:23,972
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

2141
03:05:24,032 --> 03:05:24,692
[SPEAKER_16]: Westmark, for you.

2142
03:05:25,972 --> 03:05:27,132
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

2143
03:05:27,172 --> 03:05:29,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I make one comment about the college acceptance list?

2144
03:05:29,793 --> 03:05:30,013
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2145
03:05:30,773 --> 03:05:36,194
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to note that this is a report based on about 80% of the students.

2146
03:05:37,395 --> 03:05:38,895
[SPEAKER_07]: It was as of May 10th.

2147
03:05:38,995 --> 03:05:43,296
[SPEAKER_07]: So students are still coming in and letting us know where they've gotten accepted.

2148
03:05:44,156 --> 03:05:47,677
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're still in the place where they're choosing and making final decisions.

2149
03:05:47,977 --> 03:05:49,978
[SPEAKER_07]: or at least haven't yet reported those to us yet.

2150
03:05:50,379 --> 03:06:00,045
[SPEAKER_07]: So you should expect, and I will make sure to get this to you, that a complete report explaining the postgraduate plans of all students will be prepared sometime in June.

2151
03:06:00,065 --> 03:06:05,429
[SPEAKER_07]: And that will give you the percentage breakdown of who's going to a four-year, two-year, employment, military, et cetera.

2152
03:06:06,529 --> 03:06:08,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Of these colleges, I just wanted to point out

2153
03:06:10,652 --> 03:06:11,693
[SPEAKER_07]: point out a few.

2154
03:06:12,093 --> 03:06:14,816
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have colleges from across the country.

2155
03:06:15,356 --> 03:06:18,739
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one from Washington State, which is my hometown.

2156
03:06:19,720 --> 03:06:22,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had to point that out, which is Gonzaga University.

2157
03:06:23,003 --> 03:06:26,987
[SPEAKER_07]: But also, eight of our students this year got accepted to Tufts University.

2158
03:06:27,647 --> 03:06:41,593
[SPEAKER_07]: And I spoke to the assistant director of admissions, and this was more than last year, but what he said is it was very exceptional because this year, it was their most competitive year ever for admissions, and they only accepted 14% of applicants.

2159
03:06:42,054 --> 03:06:45,895
[SPEAKER_07]: And eight of our students were accepted, and we know of five right now who are attending.

2160
03:06:45,915 --> 03:06:46,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

2161
03:06:48,737 --> 03:06:49,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

2162
03:06:49,477 --> 03:06:55,680
[SPEAKER_23]: Just want to mention while Amelia brings that up is Dr. Monaco is going to be at the high school on the 24th.

2163
03:06:57,270 --> 03:07:05,904
[SPEAKER_23]: And if you have time and you want to see him in the science labs talking with the kids and so on and so forth, we can thank him for the acceptances as well.

2164
03:07:06,605 --> 03:07:08,408
[SPEAKER_23]: Because maybe next year we'll go for 10.

2165
03:07:11,801 --> 03:07:11,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

2166
03:07:12,001 --> 03:07:12,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuno.

2167
03:07:12,961 --> 03:07:13,342
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2168
03:07:14,582 --> 03:07:27,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Going back to the AP exams, I believe we had the conversation last year, if not the year before, but are we putting students on payment plans if they're looking into the AP courses?

2169
03:07:27,486 --> 03:07:33,928
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I know that the fees of everything between proms and banquets and everything else are all at the same time.

2170
03:07:34,528 --> 03:07:38,730
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know that we had spoken about if students were interested, they could go on a payment plan.

2171
03:07:39,950 --> 03:07:40,150
[SPEAKER_14]: done?

2172
03:07:40,451 --> 03:07:42,413
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have an official payment plan.

2173
03:07:42,913 --> 03:07:49,980
[SPEAKER_07]: However, we did advertise, not advertise, but we did send out the student registration forms and alert parents a lot earlier this year.

2174
03:07:50,041 --> 03:07:53,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So a letter went home in the fall letting them know that this would be a cost coming up.

2175
03:07:55,166 --> 03:07:57,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a robocall went out as well.

2176
03:07:59,350 --> 03:08:07,493
[SPEAKER_07]: And then students who did have difficulties paying, a lot of teachers would bring a student down, students would come to me individually, and we were able to make plans work for them.

2177
03:08:07,593 --> 03:08:16,876
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was done unofficially, but we didn't have anything specific on paper that said that we had a plan, but it was communicated to the students that there was that possibility.

2178
03:08:18,197 --> 03:08:22,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think what we had talked about last year is just letting the parents know that that price was coming earlier.

2179
03:08:23,018 --> 03:08:24,279
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what we did.

2180
03:08:24,299 --> 03:08:27,000
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we could also let the parents know that

2181
03:08:27,809 --> 03:08:36,071
[SPEAKER_14]: there could be something, you know, work dealt because sometimes the student will go home and tell the parent and then the night before they're like, oh, by the way, I need $300 money order.

2182
03:08:36,831 --> 03:08:39,272
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we could, if we could do that, that would be great.

2183
03:08:40,512 --> 03:08:44,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we also this year started, uh, thanks to Pat Vili.

2184
03:08:44,793 --> 03:08:51,455
[SPEAKER_07]: We started doing the online payment system, which was fabulous because we didn't have to manage a lot of cash coming in.

2185
03:08:52,135 --> 03:08:55,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and we didn't have to worry about students writing personal checks.

2186
03:08:55,316 --> 03:08:56,596
[SPEAKER_07]: They were all able to do it online.

2187
03:08:57,807 --> 03:08:58,127
[SPEAKER_18]: Very good.

2188
03:08:59,067 --> 03:09:02,408
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a motion by Mr. Skerry to receive and place on file this report.

2189
03:09:03,008 --> 03:09:03,788
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Ms.

2190
03:09:03,808 --> 03:09:04,148
[SPEAKER_18]: Cuno.

2191
03:09:04,188 --> 03:09:04,828
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

2192
03:09:04,848 --> 03:09:04,908
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

2193
03:09:05,828 --> 03:09:06,429
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

2194
03:09:06,469 --> 03:09:07,109
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion carries.

2195
03:09:07,409 --> 03:09:08,069
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

2196
03:09:08,089 --> 03:09:08,889
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2197
03:09:11,009 --> 03:09:12,150
[SPEAKER_18]: And our next report.

2198
03:09:12,450 --> 03:09:13,070
[SPEAKER_23]: Fine Arts.

2199
03:09:13,770 --> 03:09:14,790
[SPEAKER_18]: Fine Arts Department.

2200
03:09:15,430 --> 03:09:16,210
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Schroeder.

2201
03:09:16,890 --> 03:09:17,231
Hello.

2202
03:09:25,454 --> 03:09:28,136
[SPEAKER_22]: Richard Trotter, Director of Media Technology and Fine Arts.

2203
03:09:28,156 --> 03:09:31,719
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm here to present the Fine Arts Report.

2204
03:09:32,800 --> 03:09:35,582
[SPEAKER_22]: First of all, it's an honor to be associated with such great staff.

2205
03:09:35,882 --> 03:09:38,384
[SPEAKER_22]: You had a taste of it earlier, Sophia Chang.

2206
03:09:38,865 --> 03:09:49,193
[SPEAKER_22]: And by the way, she received an award from Tufts Youth Philharmonic Community Service Award last Friday night, and it was a fantastic night for her.

2207
03:09:49,493 --> 03:09:50,594
[SPEAKER_22]: So I was happy to be there.

2208
03:09:52,529 --> 03:09:56,271
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to thank you, the school committee and superintendent, for funding the fine arts program.

2209
03:09:57,011 --> 03:09:59,312
[SPEAKER_22]: I really think it's an outstanding program.

2210
03:09:59,332 --> 03:09:59,972
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you do too.

2211
03:10:00,552 --> 03:10:01,733
[SPEAKER_22]: We have an unbelievable staff.

2212
03:10:02,233 --> 03:10:09,696
[SPEAKER_22]: Tonight, Tony Zigny's here, who's the lead teacher and is really the glue for the department and keeps things going.

2213
03:10:10,137 --> 03:10:13,458
[SPEAKER_22]: He's really on top of all the music programs and the art programs.

2214
03:10:14,138 --> 03:10:17,079
[SPEAKER_22]: Without his help, I couldn't do this job.

2215
03:10:18,566 --> 03:10:22,088
[SPEAKER_22]: Also, Haley Rells here, the band director, who does another fantastic job.

2216
03:10:22,108 --> 03:10:34,676
[SPEAKER_22]: The band's been at numerous performances, and I'll go through a few things, but I want you to know they're here, and if you have any particular questions, they stayed for this to answer any questions about the music program and the band, two of our programs.

2217
03:10:35,596 --> 03:10:39,219
[SPEAKER_22]: So the music program is K through 12.

2218
03:10:39,599 --> 03:10:42,581
[SPEAKER_22]: Students take music elementary through high school.

2219
03:10:43,221 --> 03:10:44,502
[SPEAKER_22]: And they have teachers at every school.

2220
03:10:45,222 --> 03:10:48,244
[SPEAKER_22]: And the basic music courses are taught at elementary.

2221
03:10:48,927 --> 03:10:55,491
[SPEAKER_22]: And the students get introduced to musical concepts and basic instruments and learn how to play, do music.

2222
03:10:56,251 --> 03:10:59,213
[SPEAKER_22]: And in the grades four to five, they start taking instruments.

2223
03:10:59,593 --> 03:11:03,355
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a string program which begins in grade four.

2224
03:11:03,855 --> 03:11:08,518
[SPEAKER_22]: And students are allowed to use a violin for $25 for the year.

2225
03:11:09,778 --> 03:11:13,601
[SPEAKER_22]: And so we usually have around 300 students doing that.

2226
03:11:13,801 --> 03:11:16,122
[SPEAKER_22]: The second year, fifth grade, they drop off a little bit.

2227
03:11:16,889 --> 03:11:19,011
[SPEAKER_22]: And we still can't maintain a good core group.

2228
03:11:19,191 --> 03:11:23,114
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you've been to the high school concert, you've seen how many students are in the high school orchestra.

2229
03:11:23,734 --> 03:11:25,495
[SPEAKER_22]: The band program starts in grade five.

2230
03:11:26,456 --> 03:11:30,739
[SPEAKER_22]: And we don't have the violins to allow students to take the $25 program.

2231
03:11:30,779 --> 03:11:33,681
[SPEAKER_22]: So they have to rent the instruments and buy the instruments.

2232
03:11:34,662 --> 03:11:35,883
[SPEAKER_22]: And so we don't have the same numbers.

2233
03:11:36,683 --> 03:11:43,949
[SPEAKER_22]: And so part of this proposal is to strengthen the band, because we need more numbers and we need more teaching periods.

2234
03:11:47,890 --> 03:11:59,776
[SPEAKER_22]: During the year, the music department performed in 14 major concert events and during additional performances at buildings and community service events.

2235
03:12:00,916 --> 03:12:05,558
[SPEAKER_22]: Three high school ensembles also participated in the mayor's inaugural ceremonies in January.

2236
03:12:06,559 --> 03:12:14,102
[SPEAKER_22]: There are a total of 11 music teachers on staff, nine full-time and two part-time, basically 10.4 teaching positions.

2237
03:12:16,163 --> 03:12:17,124
[SPEAKER_22]: The visual arts department

2238
03:12:20,393 --> 03:12:24,534
[SPEAKER_22]: It presents students with opportunities to explore and develop talents in a variety of art forms.

2239
03:12:25,114 --> 03:12:33,796
[SPEAKER_22]: At the elementary and middle school, similar to the music program, all the students take art elementary through middle, and we have teachers at all the schools.

2240
03:12:34,376 --> 03:12:37,937
[SPEAKER_22]: At the high school, the students have the option to take them as electives.

2241
03:12:38,817 --> 03:12:43,838
[SPEAKER_22]: We have comprehensive art, studio art, sculpture, ceramics, drawing, and this year, fashion.

2242
03:12:45,578 --> 03:12:49,041
[SPEAKER_22]: Many students participate in festivals and exhibitions.

2243
03:12:50,442 --> 03:12:55,146
[SPEAKER_22]: And there are some achievements, like the mosaic that was done at the Andrews, which are listed in the full report.

2244
03:12:55,866 --> 03:13:00,510
[SPEAKER_22]: There are so many accomplishments by both groups, the art and music, that it would take me a long time to go through a list.

2245
03:13:00,570 --> 03:13:01,570
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm not going to do that.

2246
03:13:01,590 --> 03:13:03,132
[SPEAKER_22]: But you have the list in front of you.

2247
03:13:03,152 --> 03:13:07,995
[SPEAKER_22]: There are a total of 10 art teachers, nine full-time and one part-time.

2248
03:13:09,736 --> 03:13:14,500
[SPEAKER_22]: And budget funds were spent on maintenance of equipment

2249
03:13:14,954 --> 03:13:20,876
[SPEAKER_22]: supplies, some technology, and buses.

2250
03:13:20,896 --> 03:13:25,037
[SPEAKER_22]: And accomplishments, the major ones, I mentioned some.

2251
03:13:25,657 --> 03:13:31,639
[SPEAKER_22]: The band participated in over 20 different events during the school year and a number of different competitions.

2252
03:13:32,479 --> 03:13:38,661
[SPEAKER_22]: Last week or two weeks ago, the band won a gold medal at the Great East Festival that was hosted here in Medford.

2253
03:13:38,941 --> 03:13:41,502
[SPEAKER_22]: So the band has won a number of awards over the years.

2254
03:13:42,162 --> 03:13:43,943
[SPEAKER_22]: Haley and the students have done a fantastic job.

2255
03:13:45,674 --> 03:13:54,420
[SPEAKER_22]: The orchestra had four students selected to the MMEA Senior District Festival, where they played with other outstanding students throughout the state.

2256
03:13:56,061 --> 03:14:01,105
[SPEAKER_22]: The chorus had a charity fundraiser and did some caroling and worked at Memorial Day and graduation.

2257
03:14:02,466 --> 03:14:14,134
[SPEAKER_22]: So, in the art I just mentioned, there were also some McGlynn Elementary students designed logos for Memphis Public Library and a number of showcases.

2258
03:14:15,724 --> 03:14:24,330
[SPEAKER_22]: The budget is the same as last year, basically, except we are asking consideration for another full, for a band teacher to teach middle school and elementary school.

2259
03:14:24,691 --> 03:14:26,092
[SPEAKER_22]: And that would allow Ms.

2260
03:14:26,972 --> 03:14:34,038
[SPEAKER_22]: Rello to stay at the high school to enhance the band program at the high school and also offer more electives and music at the high school.

2261
03:14:35,799 --> 03:14:37,000
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's the overview.

2262
03:14:37,440 --> 03:14:41,103
[SPEAKER_22]: You have the full report that you can, you know, peruse at your own time.

2263
03:14:41,403 --> 03:14:43,144
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll be happy to answer questions.

2264
03:14:43,765 --> 03:14:44,846
[SPEAKER_22]: And also, as I mentioned,

2265
03:14:45,782 --> 03:14:45,942
[SPEAKER_22]: Ms.

2266
03:14:45,962 --> 03:14:49,264
[SPEAKER_22]: Rello and Mr. Zigny are here for questions pertaining to those programs.

2267
03:14:50,245 --> 03:14:50,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

2268
03:14:50,385 --> 03:14:51,726
[SPEAKER_13]: Vander Kloof.

2269
03:14:52,026 --> 03:14:55,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to say that, of course, how wonderful all the concerts were.

2270
03:14:56,249 --> 03:14:57,629
[SPEAKER_13]: They really were outstanding.

2271
03:14:57,730 --> 03:15:05,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, the one I missed was the hand chime, but I think it's so great that we have that as an offering in Medford.

2272
03:15:05,735 --> 03:15:09,697
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, my hat is always off to Mr. Zigny and Ms.

2273
03:15:09,717 --> 03:15:11,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Rello and the other teachers.

2274
03:15:12,159 --> 03:15:14,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Perhaps they're the luckiest teachers because we do see

2275
03:15:15,225 --> 03:15:18,726
[SPEAKER_13]: the results of their work, but it was really outstanding.

2276
03:15:18,746 --> 03:15:25,189
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, tonight was a great example of the work in our fine arts department.

2277
03:15:25,209 --> 03:15:26,369
[SPEAKER_22]: I agree.

2278
03:15:26,429 --> 03:15:27,670
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2279
03:15:27,690 --> 03:15:27,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

2280
03:15:27,790 --> 03:15:28,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuno.

2281
03:15:29,188 --> 03:15:31,009
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. Gerardo, for the report.

2282
03:15:31,429 --> 03:15:32,289
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple of things.

2283
03:15:32,429 --> 03:15:35,231
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess because Mr. Zigni and Ms.

2284
03:15:35,251 --> 03:15:42,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Rallo are here, elementary, middle schools, and the high school, how are scheduling going with the music?

2285
03:15:45,275 --> 03:15:56,620
[SPEAKER_14]: I know at one point the high school students couldn't take it because of certain classes they had to take, so they had been rearranging the courses around so that way the students had the availability to take the band

2286
03:15:58,111 --> 03:15:59,412
[SPEAKER_14]: orchestra music.

2287
03:15:59,532 --> 03:16:05,615
[SPEAKER_22]: I can answer that, but I think Mr. Zegni can answer it better.

2288
03:16:05,635 --> 03:16:08,857
[SPEAKER_22]: He works with us all the time and has to live with it, so I'll let him answer.

2289
03:16:08,877 --> 03:16:10,478
[SPEAKER_22]: You're talking about the band and the orchestra, correct?

2290
03:16:11,280 --> 03:16:23,986
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, being in the orchestra for sure, because that's also in the elementary and middle schools, and I know that in the past we've had a situation where students wanted to take them, but because of their daily classes, they weren't able to.

2291
03:16:24,366 --> 03:16:27,988
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know that over the years, it was supposed to be a work on progress.

2292
03:16:29,568 --> 03:16:32,290
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, Tony Zickney, lead teacher of the Fine Arts Department.

2293
03:16:33,988 --> 03:16:41,434
[SPEAKER_27]: We generally, I just saw the numbers, I think we have like 100, for orchestra, 116 requests to take it.

2294
03:16:42,074 --> 03:16:47,738
[SPEAKER_27]: Generally, we want to run about 70% just because there's only a six-period day.

2295
03:16:48,679 --> 03:16:52,762
[SPEAKER_27]: There's just a limited number of periods available.

2296
03:16:53,122 --> 03:16:56,885
[SPEAKER_27]: A lot of our kids take AP, so if we get 70%, that's

2297
03:16:58,727 --> 03:16:59,327
[SPEAKER_27]: That's been good.

2298
03:16:59,447 --> 03:17:00,347
[SPEAKER_27]: That's been average.

2299
03:17:01,408 --> 03:17:12,711
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, there's discussion at the high school of changing the scheduling, which hopefully we're working on maybe opening up either more periods or, um, so pretty much it's status quo.

2300
03:17:14,452 --> 03:17:22,494
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, and based on the scheduling we have, um, that's pretty much how about the middle schools in the elementary school, middle school special,

2301
03:17:23,081 --> 03:17:27,323
[SPEAKER_27]: The reason, a big request is to have another teacher on board.

2302
03:17:28,884 --> 03:17:41,050
[SPEAKER_27]: Mrs. Zarello is the only band teacher, and she's expected to teach high school band, Andrews Middle School band, McGlynn Middle School band, and all the beginner classes at all the elementary schools.

2303
03:17:41,410 --> 03:17:42,211
[SPEAKER_27]: And it can't be done.

2304
03:17:42,711 --> 03:17:44,472
[SPEAKER_27]: There's not enough periods in the day.

2305
03:17:44,992 --> 03:17:50,055
[SPEAKER_27]: Luckily, one of our elementary teachers has a band background, so she's been helping out

2306
03:17:51,110 --> 03:17:53,831
[SPEAKER_27]: teaching the fifth graders one day a week.

2307
03:17:54,631 --> 03:17:57,952
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's really difficult because it all ends up being on a Wednesday.

2308
03:17:58,012 --> 03:18:00,353
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a short day at the elementary schools anyways.

2309
03:18:02,273 --> 03:18:06,675
[SPEAKER_27]: The teachers themselves, the classroom teachers, are really tight as far as their scheduling.

2310
03:18:06,735 --> 03:18:13,977
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's really, really difficult to get those classes in and see the kids the amount of time that we need to.

2311
03:18:15,077 --> 03:18:18,618
[SPEAKER_27]: So actually, our band numbers have waned a bit.

2312
03:18:19,075 --> 03:18:22,477
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's already showing up at the middle schools where the numbers have dropped.

2313
03:18:22,557 --> 03:18:29,902
[SPEAKER_27]: And very soon, it's going to start affecting the high school groups, at least the high school band.

2314
03:18:31,443 --> 03:18:33,305
[SPEAKER_27]: Luckily, I've been here, I guess, 23 years.

2315
03:18:33,365 --> 03:18:35,166
[SPEAKER_27]: Mrs. Chang was here 13 years.

2316
03:18:35,746 --> 03:18:44,332
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have that continuity and that regularity where the string program is on solid foundation.

2317
03:18:44,392 --> 03:18:47,434
[SPEAKER_27]: But the band, we really need another band teacher to kind of

2318
03:18:48,437 --> 03:18:54,722
[SPEAKER_27]: to kind of get that to where it needs to be and where we can get the numbers up to the high school.

2319
03:18:55,323 --> 03:18:57,364
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's where I think where our biggest problem is.

2320
03:18:57,905 --> 03:19:09,514
[SPEAKER_27]: And by adding that one teacher, not only is it going to help the band program immensely, it will help scheduling at all the other schools around the city.

2321
03:19:11,466 --> 03:19:18,890
[SPEAKER_27]: let the teacher go back to the books, and books can go back to having a full-time general music teacher, which they're losing one day a week for the band program.

2322
03:19:21,311 --> 03:19:36,078
[SPEAKER_27]: It will allow us at the high school to have the guitar 2 class as a follow-up to a guitar class now, percussion 2 class as a follow-up to a percussion class, and most importantly, a new music technology course that we want to

2323
03:19:36,444 --> 03:19:46,767
[SPEAKER_27]: put up the high school, which music technology is probably the biggest growing area in music, not only in education, but in industry.

2324
03:19:47,587 --> 03:19:49,847
[SPEAKER_27]: And we actually had some music technology in the pit.

2325
03:19:49,887 --> 03:19:51,088
[SPEAKER_27]: We were way ahead of the game.

2326
03:19:51,228 --> 03:19:53,428
[SPEAKER_27]: We had it when no one else did, and then we lost it.

2327
03:19:53,488 --> 03:19:54,889
[SPEAKER_27]: And it would be nice to get that back.

2328
03:19:55,909 --> 03:20:04,131
[SPEAKER_27]: And it will also give the possibility to give the McGlynn Middle School more of a full schedule.

2329
03:20:04,696 --> 03:20:11,002
[SPEAKER_27]: So that one position by altering everything is gonna benefit us in many different areas.

2330
03:20:11,062 --> 03:20:13,524
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's probably our biggest need.

2331
03:20:14,065 --> 03:20:18,409
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing I was gonna ask is on the contract that we have with the instrument company.

2332
03:20:18,689 --> 03:20:18,849
[SPEAKER_27]: Yep.

2333
03:20:19,490 --> 03:20:22,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Up until the fifth grade, they only rent.

2334
03:20:23,534 --> 03:20:23,734
[SPEAKER_14]: Right?

2335
03:20:24,154 --> 03:20:24,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Up until fifth grade?

2336
03:20:25,416 --> 03:20:26,977
[SPEAKER_27]: Are we talking band, strings?

2337
03:20:27,057 --> 03:20:27,277
[SPEAKER_14]: Both.

2338
03:20:27,758 --> 03:20:28,018
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

2339
03:20:28,539 --> 03:20:29,780
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have...

2340
03:20:31,031 --> 03:20:38,197
[SPEAKER_27]: We have well over 200 string instruments that we use for our beginners, and they pay a user fee which helps us keep them in shape.

2341
03:20:38,937 --> 03:20:44,782
[SPEAKER_27]: After the fourth grade, they have to either rent or buy or provide their own.

2342
03:20:45,543 --> 03:20:52,489
[SPEAKER_27]: The band, they're renting pretty much from the start because we just don't have that fleet of instruments.

2343
03:20:54,141 --> 03:21:00,005
[SPEAKER_27]: And again, they can rent from the company that we recommend, or they can get them on their own, they can buy them on their own.

2344
03:21:00,025 --> 03:21:00,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2345
03:21:00,406 --> 03:21:03,468
[SPEAKER_14]: And at what grade does the band have to make the decision, too?

2346
03:21:03,508 --> 03:21:04,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it the fourth grade also?

2347
03:21:04,749 --> 03:21:06,751
[SPEAKER_27]: Fifth grade, because they start in fifth.

2348
03:21:06,811 --> 03:21:15,878
[SPEAKER_27]: Violin, strings start in fourth grade with the school instruments, and then in fifth grade, both the violins and the band need to either rent or probably buy their own.

2349
03:21:16,158 --> 03:21:18,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a way of speaking to the company

2350
03:21:19,841 --> 03:21:22,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they've been with us for such a long period of time.

2351
03:21:22,303 --> 03:21:40,820
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean they've been and they've been giving us a great Opportunity for our students to rent it rather than you know versus buying it But I don't know if it's really been looked at over the years because it seems like it's the same contract that's been out there for many many years we have Yeah a few years ago we did

2352
03:21:42,022 --> 03:21:44,244
[SPEAKER_27]: I have a lot of other vendors, and I actually do get calls.

2353
03:21:45,185 --> 03:21:52,413
[SPEAKER_27]: And basically, the instrument company we're dealing with now is by far the least expensive.

2354
03:21:52,794 --> 03:21:53,434
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I know that.

2355
03:21:53,475 --> 03:22:02,705
[SPEAKER_14]: What I'm asking is, is there a program out there, instead of having our students select in fourth and fifth grade, that they go from renting to either buying it,

2356
03:22:03,826 --> 03:22:08,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there something that maybe we could overlap it and have them rent it all the way up to middle school?

2357
03:22:08,692 --> 03:22:19,446
[SPEAKER_27]: So that way maybe we could have the kids... Yeah, right now the band is a rent-to-own, so they do continue to rent until it's paid off and then they will own it if they continue.

2358
03:22:20,066 --> 03:22:21,368
[SPEAKER_27]: So it is a rent-to-own program.

2359
03:22:21,929 --> 03:22:22,209
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

2360
03:22:23,208 --> 03:22:26,689
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other thing I was just going to say, oh, congratulations to the band.

2361
03:22:28,450 --> 03:22:33,812
[SPEAKER_14]: They were invited to the Hershey Pennsylvania Invitational to go and compete there.

2362
03:22:33,832 --> 03:22:35,452
[SPEAKER_14]: So congratulations to them.

2363
03:22:35,492 --> 03:22:36,332
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, absolutely.

2364
03:22:39,033 --> 03:22:39,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

2365
03:22:39,193 --> 03:22:39,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Kratz.

2366
03:22:40,754 --> 03:22:45,996
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say I enjoyed all the bands, concerts, everything.

2367
03:22:46,116 --> 03:22:49,817
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always just perfect, beautiful, amazing job.

2368
03:22:49,877 --> 03:22:50,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you both.

2369
03:22:51,017 --> 03:22:51,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2370
03:22:51,858 --> 03:22:52,118
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2371
03:22:53,692 --> 03:22:54,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto.

2372
03:22:54,813 --> 03:22:55,213
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2373
03:22:56,374 --> 03:22:57,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your presentation.

2374
03:22:57,755 --> 03:22:58,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

2375
03:22:58,576 --> 03:23:01,138
[SPEAKER_16]: And the music tonight was wonderful, as always.

2376
03:23:01,578 --> 03:23:06,522
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't get the opportunity this year to see the concerts as I usually do.

2377
03:23:07,262 --> 03:23:08,283
[SPEAKER_27]: We'll get you a DVD.

2378
03:23:08,303 --> 03:23:09,304
[SPEAKER_27]: We do that.

2379
03:23:10,565 --> 03:23:14,568
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much, because it is the highlight of my end of the school year.

2380
03:23:14,908 --> 03:23:15,889
[SPEAKER_17]: That'll pay for everything.

2381
03:23:15,929 --> 03:23:17,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2382
03:23:18,011 --> 03:23:19,412
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a couple questions.

2383
03:23:19,552 --> 03:23:21,834
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm wondering if the cost

2384
03:23:23,014 --> 03:23:33,323
[SPEAKER_16]: of renting violins in that program leads more parents into going into that program, plus the beginning of starting it a year earlier.

2385
03:23:34,704 --> 03:23:49,656
[SPEAKER_16]: And because I know as a parent who rented to own a saxophone, it ended up being very expensive at the end, compared to a parent whose other child played violin.

2386
03:23:50,247 --> 03:23:54,591
[SPEAKER_16]: It was much more affordable, so we need to take into consideration that fact.

2387
03:23:55,212 --> 03:24:02,479
[SPEAKER_16]: But in that regard, I know we were getting all of our antique equipment.

2388
03:24:03,790 --> 03:24:09,375
[SPEAKER_16]: and musical instruments evaluated, and I was wondering where we stood on that situation.

2389
03:24:09,495 --> 03:24:27,551
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if you were aware, Mayor Burke, we have wonderful antique instruments in storage at our high school facility that are very valuable, and we were having them evaluated as to what their worth was, so that way we could let musicians throughout the world bid on them.

2390
03:24:28,211 --> 03:24:32,572
[SPEAKER_16]: and use them rather than be in our possession and not being used.

2391
03:24:32,973 --> 03:24:50,158
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like an update, and I think I asked for this prior, to the superintendent, where we are, what the evaluations are on these pieces of equipment, and what it would take to actually get them out so people could enjoy using them and we could enjoy the money and put it back in our program.

2392
03:24:53,757 --> 03:25:18,916
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm making a motion to the superintendent to provide the school committee with a list of inventory, and I know it will take time because right now we're in the beginning of the budget, but maybe by the end of September, have the list of inventory and the value of such items presented to the school committee so we can decide how to move forward from that.

2393
03:25:19,596 --> 03:25:20,016
[SPEAKER_16]: a motion.

2394
03:25:20,317 --> 03:25:29,984
[SPEAKER_18]: On the motion that a report be furnished on the list of music equipment that's in storage at this point that could be available for auction.

2395
03:25:30,825 --> 03:25:31,806
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Ms.

2396
03:25:31,866 --> 03:25:32,507
[SPEAKER_18]: Mustone.

2397
03:25:32,547 --> 03:25:33,407
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

2398
03:25:33,687 --> 03:25:33,808
Aye.

2399
03:25:34,128 --> 03:25:34,848
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

2400
03:25:35,069 --> 03:25:35,789
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

2401
03:25:35,809 --> 03:25:38,071
[SPEAKER_18]: Is everyone all set?

2402
03:25:38,812 --> 03:25:39,772
[SPEAKER_18]: Any other questions?

2403
03:25:40,753 --> 03:25:43,055
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file?

2404
03:25:43,075 --> 03:25:43,475
[SPEAKER_18]: So moved.

2405
03:25:43,676 --> 03:25:44,016
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

2406
03:25:44,516 --> 03:25:45,037
[SPEAKER_18]: So moved.

2407
03:25:45,197 --> 03:25:46,077
[SPEAKER_18]: Seconded by Ms.

2408
03:25:46,097 --> 03:25:46,438
[SPEAKER_18]: Cuneo.

2409
03:25:46,478 --> 03:25:47,278
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

2410
03:25:47,939 --> 03:25:48,720
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

2411
03:25:49,905 --> 03:25:50,706
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

2412
03:25:51,086 --> 03:25:58,733
[SPEAKER_18]: If I could also congratulate and thank you all for all the community service that you do on behalf of the community between Patriots Day, the inauguration.

2413
03:25:58,753 --> 03:26:00,634
[SPEAKER_18]: We have Memorial Day coming up, 10 a.m.

2414
03:26:00,674 --> 03:26:01,335
[SPEAKER_18]: Memorial Day.

2415
03:26:01,355 --> 03:26:07,761
[SPEAKER_18]: It's at the end, and I believe the chorus will be there, and then with a short march over to Veterans Monument.

2416
03:26:07,821 --> 03:26:11,204
[SPEAKER_18]: So telling everybody out there, mark it on your calendar.

2417
03:26:11,224 --> 03:26:13,145
[SPEAKER_18]: They're fabulous, and we look forward to seeing them.

2418
03:26:13,546 --> 03:26:13,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2419
03:26:14,407 --> 03:26:14,707
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2420
03:26:18,892 --> 03:26:23,275
[SPEAKER_18]: report on National Science Foundation Computer Applications Grant Program.

2421
03:26:23,515 --> 03:26:24,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Superintendent?

2422
03:26:26,217 --> 03:26:31,020
[SPEAKER_23]: So Madam Mayor, members of the committee, Molly Waden is with us tonight.

2423
03:26:31,861 --> 03:26:36,284
[SPEAKER_23]: Molly headed up this project and filed it with UMass Lowell.

2424
03:26:37,164 --> 03:26:41,227
[SPEAKER_23]: And this project is really an advanced project for a school system.

2425
03:26:41,788 --> 03:26:48,232
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a $1.2 million grant, which we share with UMass Lowell and Everett.

2426
03:26:48,826 --> 03:26:54,127
[SPEAKER_23]: But the work was done here with MOLLE and MOLLE, UMass MOLLE.

2427
03:26:54,887 --> 03:26:59,549
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's a program where youngsters have really gone to the next stage of computer development.

2428
03:27:00,209 --> 03:27:08,991
[SPEAKER_23]: Instead of just doing the routine searches and things like that, they're actually developing the applications that people buy and developing new engineering techniques.

2429
03:27:09,671 --> 03:27:16,953
[SPEAKER_23]: The way we've got to look at the future is that when we talk about science education and the like, it's not just learning the facts or the information.

2430
03:27:16,973 --> 03:27:18,393
[SPEAKER_23]: Now it's engineering solutions.

2431
03:27:19,150 --> 03:27:20,891
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is a major step.

2432
03:27:21,531 --> 03:27:28,413
[SPEAKER_23]: And for our middle school youngsters to do this is an incredible step forward in computer science education.

2433
03:27:28,493 --> 03:27:29,514
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's to be a model.

2434
03:27:30,414 --> 03:27:30,814
[SPEAKER_23]: But Ms.

2435
03:27:30,854 --> 03:27:31,134
[SPEAKER_23]: Molly.

2436
03:27:31,474 --> 03:27:31,575
[SPEAKER_21]: Ms.

2437
03:27:31,615 --> 03:27:31,895
[SPEAKER_21]: Layden.

2438
03:27:32,875 --> 03:27:33,295
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

2439
03:27:33,315 --> 03:27:33,595
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

2440
03:27:34,235 --> 03:27:34,916
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm Molly Layden.

2441
03:27:34,976 --> 03:27:37,057
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm in Instructional Technology in the schools.

2442
03:27:37,757 --> 03:27:40,138
[SPEAKER_21]: The Middle School Pathways Project, we are actually midway.

2443
03:27:40,178 --> 03:27:42,378
[SPEAKER_21]: We're almost a year and a half into a three-year project.

2444
03:27:42,919 --> 03:27:44,919
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's funded by the National Science Foundation.

2445
03:27:44,979 --> 03:27:45,480
[SPEAKER_21]: It's $1.2 million.

2446
03:27:47,071 --> 03:27:48,272
[SPEAKER_21]: total for the three years.

2447
03:27:48,792 --> 03:27:52,014
[SPEAKER_21]: UMass Lowell actually, the computer science department, is actually the fiscal agent.

2448
03:27:52,415 --> 03:27:53,696
[SPEAKER_21]: But we work on the grant with them.

2449
03:27:53,716 --> 03:27:54,996
[SPEAKER_21]: We're co-directing the grant.

2450
03:27:56,237 --> 03:28:05,003
[SPEAKER_21]: The partnership is the UMass Lowell Computer Science, the Medford and Edford Public Schools, and TriTech, the Tri-City Technology Education Collaborative.

2451
03:28:05,484 --> 03:28:12,148
[SPEAKER_21]: And it really is designed to bring computing experiences, project-based computing experiences, to our middle school students.

2452
03:28:15,336 --> 03:28:18,718
[SPEAKER_21]: It's about more than just learning how to do computer science.

2453
03:28:18,758 --> 03:28:20,799
[SPEAKER_21]: It's really learning about the field of computer science.

2454
03:28:20,859 --> 03:28:26,463
[SPEAKER_21]: So we look at having students learn about different kinds of careers beyond just programming.

2455
03:28:26,603 --> 03:28:31,086
[SPEAKER_21]: There's almost any job our students will be in will be using computer science in some way.

2456
03:28:31,126 --> 03:28:37,350
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're trying to build that comfort level and introduce them to computer science at an earlier grade than waiting until high school.

2457
03:28:38,350 --> 03:28:40,752
[SPEAKER_21]: It's also designed to motivate students to

2458
03:28:42,145 --> 03:28:51,333
[SPEAKER_21]: pique some interest and perhaps pursue high school courses and beyond, and perhaps even some careers that are computer science or computer science related careers.

2459
03:28:51,694 --> 03:28:54,516
[SPEAKER_21]: Those careers may be programming, but they also may be graphics.

2460
03:28:54,536 --> 03:28:55,237
[SPEAKER_21]: They may be network.

2461
03:28:55,257 --> 03:28:56,038
[SPEAKER_21]: They may be support.

2462
03:28:56,098 --> 03:29:00,962
[SPEAKER_21]: But almost any job that our students do will use some of those skills.

2463
03:29:01,182 --> 03:29:06,087
[SPEAKER_21]: It's to bring computing experience and career awareness to students who are traditionally not in the field.

2464
03:29:06,572 --> 03:29:17,435
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not students who would just self-select to be in that field, but students who are going to learn about it for the first time and then may select to be in the robotics club later on, if not specifically in computer programming classes.

2465
03:29:17,475 --> 03:29:24,216
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's really to bring that computing experience to students who may otherwise may not get it, self-select to receive it.

2466
03:29:24,997 --> 03:29:33,799
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's to take students beyond Microsoft Office, or Google, or basic computing and technology tools, but really looking at it as a broader field.

2467
03:29:35,476 --> 03:29:52,083
[SPEAKER_21]: As I mentioned, we're about halfway through the grant, so the implementation has our teachers begin doing about 30 hours of professional development in the summer, and then they move into school year activities, professional development, and they develop a 15 to 20 hour curriculum that they do with their middle school students in both middle schools.

2468
03:29:52,483 --> 03:29:56,985
[SPEAKER_21]: We have five teachers to date who have been trained, are participating continuously throughout the three years.

2469
03:29:57,703 --> 03:30:04,647
[SPEAKER_21]: And those teachers actually look at their current curriculum, and they work with this computer science curriculum, and they make it work into their curriculum.

2470
03:30:04,707 --> 03:30:11,191
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's computer science brought into technology, or computer science brought into their technology curriculum, their engineering curriculum.

2471
03:30:12,792 --> 03:30:16,895
[SPEAKER_21]: They do about 15 to 20 hours during the school year, and then we run summer camps.

2472
03:30:16,935 --> 03:30:23,379
[SPEAKER_21]: So we had two summer camps last summer at the high school, and we'll have two summer camps this coming summer that will be at the McGlynn Middle.

2473
03:30:24,319 --> 03:30:26,160
[SPEAKER_21]: Teachers have the choice to teach those camps.

2474
03:30:26,240 --> 03:30:27,001
[SPEAKER_21]: They don't all have to.

2475
03:30:27,692 --> 03:30:30,993
[SPEAKER_21]: And then they showcase the event, the work that the students are doing.

2476
03:30:32,613 --> 03:30:38,795
[SPEAKER_21]: What is really unique about the project is that students become developers instead of just users of technology.

2477
03:30:38,815 --> 03:30:41,495
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're developing mobile apps on Android devices.

2478
03:30:41,535 --> 03:30:42,395
[SPEAKER_21]: We provide the carts.

2479
03:30:43,336 --> 03:30:52,818
[SPEAKER_21]: And those, although they are trying to sell them apps, we are not actually looking to have them sell the apps, but they are looking at designing and developing and creating.

2480
03:30:53,058 --> 03:30:56,339
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's a different kind of competing experiences for our students.

2481
03:30:57,907 --> 03:31:02,449
[SPEAKER_21]: We have computer science professionals who come into the classroom to talk about the kinds of work they do.

2482
03:31:02,469 --> 03:31:15,175
[SPEAKER_21]: We try and get a diverse group of professionals from different kinds of jobs and who are from, who are women, who are different people that they would actually traditionally think are in the job.

2483
03:31:15,815 --> 03:31:17,296
[SPEAKER_21]: We've had people come from iRobot.

2484
03:31:17,856 --> 03:31:26,941
[SPEAKER_21]: We've had people come from universities, from Amazon Robotics, the manware, cast, polytronics, a variety of fields that they've come in and talked to the students about what they do.

2485
03:31:30,825 --> 03:31:33,227
[SPEAKER_21]: They come in during the school year and they come in during the summers.

2486
03:31:35,168 --> 03:31:41,613
[SPEAKER_21]: The lasting curriculum change is that every student in our district, every student will come to middle school and have participated in the project.

2487
03:31:41,813 --> 03:31:47,917
[SPEAKER_21]: Every student will have some experience with the app development to introduce them to the field.

2488
03:31:48,958 --> 03:31:56,443
[SPEAKER_21]: They may like it, they may not like it so much, but they've had some exposure to that over the course of the school year that they're in.

2489
03:31:59,865 --> 03:32:04,348
[SPEAKER_21]: To date, we've had a year and a half.

2490
03:32:04,368 --> 03:32:06,750
[SPEAKER_21]: The second year professional development is completing.

2491
03:32:06,810 --> 03:32:09,792
[SPEAKER_21]: The second year classroom implementation is completing.

2492
03:32:11,620 --> 03:32:16,824
[SPEAKER_21]: We've had classroom visitors, and we've had an outside evaluator look at the project.

2493
03:32:16,844 --> 03:32:18,805
[SPEAKER_21]: They've had a variety of great results.

2494
03:32:19,105 --> 03:32:21,187
[SPEAKER_21]: Students are increased in their interest.

2495
03:32:21,707 --> 03:32:26,870
[SPEAKER_21]: We will be looking next year about if students are then taking higher level classes in the high school.

2496
03:32:27,551 --> 03:32:28,311
[SPEAKER_21]: We haven't gotten there yet.

2497
03:32:28,331 --> 03:32:29,492
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to start looking next year.

2498
03:32:30,573 --> 03:32:35,596
[SPEAKER_21]: I included some pictures of some of the apps that the students have created during the summer camp.

2499
03:32:36,917 --> 03:32:42,661
[SPEAKER_21]: We are trying to get them to look at their communities and develop apps based on the community needs.

2500
03:32:42,721 --> 03:32:49,365
[SPEAKER_21]: So they had a tree warden, they looked at energy and environment, they looked at the Board of Health, farmers market, and these are some of the apps.

2501
03:32:49,385 --> 03:32:51,226
[SPEAKER_21]: They haven't sold them yet, they'd like to sell them.

2502
03:32:54,148 --> 03:32:56,069
[SPEAKER_21]: This is our budget breakdown.

2503
03:32:56,129 --> 03:32:57,810
[SPEAKER_21]: It's $1.2 million, as I mentioned.

2504
03:32:57,910 --> 03:33:00,672
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of it goes towards teacher stipends for professional development.

2505
03:33:00,692 --> 03:33:09,517
[SPEAKER_21]: Some of it goes for the camps, instructors, UMass Lowell to do professional development for our teachers, an outside evaluator.

2506
03:33:09,957 --> 03:33:11,178
[SPEAKER_21]: We have an advisory board.

2507
03:33:14,200 --> 03:33:22,363
[SPEAKER_21]: The goal is that we develop a pathway, so students are introduced K-5 in introductory activities, code.org kind of intro weeks.

2508
03:33:23,224 --> 03:33:38,210
[SPEAKER_21]: They will do the middle school project and then hopefully as they enter high school they'll look towards vocational programs that are certainly aligned or exploring computer science curriculum at the 9th grade, 10th grade, and then higher level computer programming courses.

2509
03:33:39,191 --> 03:33:41,832
[SPEAKER_21]: So generally junior or senior year in high school.

2510
03:33:45,492 --> 03:33:45,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

2511
03:33:45,592 --> 03:33:46,032
[SPEAKER_13]: van de Kloot.

2512
03:33:47,253 --> 03:33:48,774
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is just fantastic.

2513
03:33:48,914 --> 03:33:53,017
[SPEAKER_13]: I should tell you that my daughter develops, works for a company which develops iOS apps.

2514
03:33:53,738 --> 03:34:00,622
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I, you know, I have firsthand experience of sort of knowing what an incredible career potential this is.

2515
03:34:01,803 --> 03:34:10,709
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I guess my biggest concern is after the grant ends, what we do, because this is something that we would like, I would like to see continued.

2516
03:34:11,210 --> 03:34:14,652
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, like you say, it's going to be very interesting to see.

2517
03:34:15,052 --> 03:34:20,836
[SPEAKER_13]: where the kids who are being exposed now, where they go with it, and what they do at the high school level.

2518
03:34:20,896 --> 03:34:24,898
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to commend you for all your work and thank you for your work on this project.

2519
03:34:26,921 --> 03:34:27,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Benedetto?

2520
03:34:27,962 --> 03:34:28,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2521
03:34:29,183 --> 03:34:32,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Do the students have any opportunity to do coding?

2522
03:34:32,885 --> 03:34:42,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Because most of the people in the industry now are desperate for coders in all aspects of, that's all I'm hearing.

2523
03:34:42,232 --> 03:34:47,416
[SPEAKER_16]: And so a lot of high schools and a lot of different schools are teaching students how to code.

2524
03:34:48,325 --> 03:34:48,825
[SPEAKER_21]: So they do.

2525
03:34:48,905 --> 03:34:53,167
[SPEAKER_21]: So our K-5 students all do some introductory coding activities.

2526
03:34:53,867 --> 03:34:57,948
[SPEAKER_21]: And then this is somewhere in between the two.

2527
03:34:58,028 --> 03:35:01,129
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's essentially a drag and drop program.

2528
03:35:01,189 --> 03:35:02,290
[SPEAKER_21]: It's introductory coding.

2529
03:35:02,630 --> 03:35:08,272
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's before they get the higher level programming at the high school, it's an intro to computer programming.

2530
03:35:08,472 --> 03:35:10,332
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we offer coding at our high school?

2531
03:35:10,392 --> 03:35:15,554
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it incorporated in any of the classes or any certification when they come out?

2532
03:35:15,674 --> 03:35:17,855
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I know in industry, this is

2533
03:35:18,325 --> 03:35:21,788
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a huge job opportunity, like Paulette said.

2534
03:35:22,588 --> 03:35:31,414
[SPEAKER_21]: So we now have at the, we have an exploring computer science course that starts, and it's an introductory class, hopefully to feed our higher level programming classes.

2535
03:35:31,455 --> 03:35:44,524
[SPEAKER_21]: And in that class, they do introduction to coding, they do some web design, they do some robotics, they do, it's a full year course, and they do a module in each of these different areas to introduce you to all the different areas, including coding.

2536
03:35:44,971 --> 03:35:47,713
[SPEAKER_21]: and then they can go into a higher level course as they move through high school.

2537
03:35:48,194 --> 03:36:00,604
[SPEAKER_21]: But K-5, all this introductory programming class, coding class, either, it could be very short at the lower grades, it could be a little longer at the upper elementary, then by middle school they're doing this, which is really a beginning programming.

2538
03:36:00,664 --> 03:36:04,327
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a drag and drop, but they actually have to do things to make things work.

2539
03:36:04,387 --> 03:36:06,029
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's the beginning part of that coding.

2540
03:36:07,010 --> 03:36:07,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2541
03:36:09,045 --> 03:36:09,365
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2542
03:36:09,385 --> 03:36:13,328
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a motion on the floor to receive in place on file offered by Mr. Scarry, seconded by Ms.

2543
03:36:13,348 --> 03:36:13,868
[SPEAKER_18]: Vander Kloot.

2544
03:36:13,908 --> 03:36:14,708
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

2545
03:36:15,509 --> 03:36:16,229
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

2546
03:36:16,269 --> 03:36:16,830
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Molly.

2547
03:36:16,870 --> 03:36:17,530
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

2548
03:36:17,550 --> 03:36:18,291
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

2549
03:36:23,214 --> 03:36:24,675
[SPEAKER_18]: Report on summer programs.

2550
03:36:24,695 --> 03:36:27,416
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're going to call on our deputy superintendent to do this.

2551
03:36:27,496 --> 03:36:28,377
[SPEAKER_23]: It's almost summertime.

2552
03:36:29,898 --> 03:36:31,819
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think the program's starting soon.

2553
03:36:34,240 --> 03:36:38,503
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go through every single program, only the basic

2554
03:36:38,948 --> 03:36:41,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Information is there for you.

2555
03:36:41,809 --> 03:36:46,089
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been planning these programs with different administrators who oversee them and teachers.

2556
03:36:47,169 --> 03:36:51,350
[SPEAKER_01]: We have programs that are grant-funded, as the one Molly just explained.

2557
03:36:51,810 --> 03:36:55,031
[SPEAKER_01]: We have others that students pay tuition, like regular summer school.

2558
03:36:56,251 --> 03:37:00,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have others that the district supports, like our very popular High School 101.

2559
03:37:02,632 --> 03:37:07,013
[SPEAKER_01]: We get out of school the 22nd, and the programs actually start the next day.

2560
03:37:07,618 --> 03:37:17,720
[SPEAKER_01]: So the earliest programs start the 23rd, and all the programs except for the vocational adult program will end by August 25th.

2561
03:37:17,840 --> 03:37:23,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the programs are elementary, middle, high school, and the adult program.

2562
03:37:23,722 --> 03:37:25,802
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our regular summer fund program.

2563
03:37:26,303 --> 03:37:33,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I've listed for you the contact people, so if you're interested in further information, this program will run at Medford High School.

2564
03:37:34,465 --> 03:37:36,365
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's a full day program for

2565
03:37:37,004 --> 03:37:37,985
[SPEAKER_01]: elementary students.

2566
03:37:40,468 --> 03:37:47,235
[SPEAKER_01]: The regular summer school, that's for students who have to make up a course because they haven't passed it in middle school or high school.

2567
03:37:47,775 --> 03:37:54,722
[SPEAKER_01]: And that program is being run by David Blow and Jill Sawyer, and their contacts are listed there.

2568
03:37:55,744 --> 03:37:57,325
[SPEAKER_01]: Those programs cost $250 per course.

2569
03:37:59,613 --> 03:38:04,596
[SPEAKER_01]: for our students, and then if we have out-of-district students, it's higher, it's $300.

2570
03:38:05,056 --> 03:38:05,937
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very excited.

2571
03:38:05,957 --> 03:38:09,479
[SPEAKER_01]: This year we're going to do the science offerings online.

2572
03:38:09,920 --> 03:38:14,763
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually, Molly was helpful with this, we've looked through different companies.

2573
03:38:15,183 --> 03:38:22,608
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that the one company in Menton, which is really Plato in disguise, has good curriculum.

2574
03:38:22,628 --> 03:38:29,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Cieri has looked through it and found that it's very much the same as the regular curriculum we teach in the sciences.

2575
03:38:29,769 --> 03:38:34,131
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have the online science offerings in regular summer school.

2576
03:38:35,711 --> 03:38:38,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have programs for special populations.

2577
03:38:38,832 --> 03:38:40,673
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a program for ELL learners.

2578
03:38:41,293 --> 03:38:46,195
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many special education programs that fit the different needs of those students.

2579
03:38:47,016 --> 03:38:55,519
[SPEAKER_01]: Molly spoke about the computer camp for middle school youngsters, and all the dates and information are listed for you there.

2580
03:38:57,279 --> 03:38:57,960
[SPEAKER_01]: And what have I missed?

2581
03:38:57,980 --> 03:38:58,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, high school 101.

2582
03:38:59,695 --> 03:39:06,477
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a program for students entering grade nine who have been identified as academically being challenged.

2583
03:39:06,717 --> 03:39:12,019
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the summer, students, when they leave grade eight, they get a summer assignment in mathematics and English.

2584
03:39:12,719 --> 03:39:15,100
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes these students need a little boost with that.

2585
03:39:15,200 --> 03:39:20,942
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is we get them going with the summer work, but then we bring them back into school a few days earlier.

2586
03:39:21,422 --> 03:39:28,885
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are teachers that are helping them to finish up the summer work so that they're not behind once they get into the ninth grade classes.

2587
03:39:29,846 --> 03:39:39,013
[SPEAKER_01]: This program actually runs for a few days, the last week in August, just before freshman orientation, and it culminates with the freshman orientation.

2588
03:39:39,053 --> 03:39:50,662
[SPEAKER_01]: So those ninth graders are there a few days earlier, they get to meet some teachers, they get to meet some administrators, and then it's just a seamless transition into the regular orientation with all the rest of the incoming freshmen.

2589
03:39:52,263 --> 03:39:56,606
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, lots to do for kids this summer.

2590
03:39:57,258 --> 03:40:03,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be more than happy to answer any questions, but we're in the process of hiring staff and getting that all ready.

2591
03:40:03,821 --> 03:40:11,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Programs will be at the high school, the McGlynn, and the Roberts this summer.

2592
03:40:11,824 --> 03:40:15,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, your contact people are listed there if you want more information.

2593
03:40:16,606 --> 03:40:16,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

2594
03:40:16,946 --> 03:40:17,046
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

2595
03:40:17,106 --> 03:40:17,566
[SPEAKER_18]: Van de Kloot.

2596
03:40:18,453 --> 03:40:19,654
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I didn't say anything.

2597
03:40:20,695 --> 03:40:20,855
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

2598
03:40:20,896 --> 03:40:21,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Cuno.

2599
03:40:22,097 --> 03:40:22,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ms.

2600
03:40:22,637 --> 03:40:23,018
[SPEAKER_14]: Nelson.

2601
03:40:24,079 --> 03:40:30,605
[SPEAKER_14]: When you say the online programs, are the students going to have to take them at school?

2602
03:40:30,885 --> 03:40:31,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

2603
03:40:31,526 --> 03:40:31,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2604
03:40:32,067 --> 03:40:36,831
[SPEAKER_01]: The content will be online, but physically the students will be there with the teacher.

2605
03:40:37,492 --> 03:40:38,193
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, thank you.

2606
03:40:41,432 --> 03:40:43,393
[SPEAKER_18]: Is there a motion to receive the report?

2607
03:40:43,973 --> 03:40:44,854
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much, Ms.

2608
03:40:44,914 --> 03:40:45,234
[SPEAKER_18]: Nelson.

2609
03:40:46,114 --> 03:40:48,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion to receive the report and place on file.

2610
03:40:49,135 --> 03:40:49,695
[SPEAKER_18]: Offered by Ms.

2611
03:40:49,755 --> 03:40:50,896
[SPEAKER_18]: Cuneo, seconded by Ms.

2612
03:40:50,916 --> 03:40:51,536
[SPEAKER_18]: Van de Kloot.

2613
03:40:51,956 --> 03:40:52,617
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

2614
03:40:53,417 --> 03:40:54,137
[SPEAKER_18]: All those opposed?

2615
03:40:54,757 --> 03:40:55,538
[SPEAKER_18]: Motion passes.

2616
03:40:56,338 --> 03:40:57,758
[SPEAKER_18]: Report on community schools.

2617
03:40:58,399 --> 03:40:59,199
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Superintendent.

2618
03:40:59,559 --> 03:41:10,083
[SPEAKER_23]: Madam Mayor, members of the committee, you have a very extensive report here dealing with community schools, not only with information about the programs, but also with a lot of financial data.

2619
03:41:10,947 --> 03:41:25,873
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, Pat Vuey, uh, working with, uh, the community schools office, uh, put this together and Farina, Mr. Maloney, uh, Rachel Perry and others put this together so that we could, uh, analyze whatever you had concerns about.

2620
03:41:26,454 --> 03:41:27,734
[SPEAKER_23]: So Pat is here.

2621
03:41:28,615 --> 03:41:33,957
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, any questions you may have, uh, we can all try to answer them and, uh, go from there.

2622
03:41:34,057 --> 03:41:35,938
[SPEAKER_23]: But there's a pretty extensive report here.

2623
03:41:36,018 --> 03:41:38,159
[SPEAKER_23]: We can, uh, we're talking about community schools itself.

2624
03:41:39,730 --> 03:41:58,080
[SPEAKER_23]: MHS community pool and the edgily field One other thing to say though some of this material you received at the committee of the whole I mean the subcommittee And build these grounds some of it is additional based on additional requests This is a better day

2625
03:42:03,612 --> 03:42:09,976
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that we have met all of the requests that have been coming to us from the school committee for the last six months.

2626
03:42:10,696 --> 03:42:12,557
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's very extensive.

2627
03:42:13,378 --> 03:42:19,682
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you see in your packet, you'll see a narrative that explains each fund.

2628
03:42:20,983 --> 03:42:25,325
[SPEAKER_15]: And we can start with Liamis Poole.

2629
03:42:28,427 --> 03:42:29,508
[SPEAKER_15]: Poole's doing very well.

2630
03:42:29,528 --> 03:42:30,328
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe Rachel.

2631
03:42:31,429 --> 03:42:32,370
[SPEAKER_15]: There she is.

2632
03:42:32,410 --> 03:42:33,010
[SPEAKER_15]: She is still here.

2633
03:42:33,377 --> 03:42:35,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Rachel's been doing a fantastic job with the pool.

2634
03:42:35,938 --> 03:42:37,438
[SPEAKER_15]: This is our second year of operation.

2635
03:42:37,498 --> 03:42:39,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Not our second full year, but about a year and a half.

2636
03:42:40,679 --> 03:42:44,059
[SPEAKER_15]: And we are seeing that it's busier.

2637
03:42:44,579 --> 03:42:45,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Revenue is going up.

2638
03:42:46,880 --> 03:42:49,480
[SPEAKER_15]: The pool will still end the year in a negative balance.

2639
03:42:50,281 --> 03:42:53,161
[SPEAKER_15]: And really, it's kind of a superficial negative.

2640
03:42:53,561 --> 03:43:00,583
[SPEAKER_15]: We have not charged use of the summer fund program or the April or February camps to that pool yet.

2641
03:43:02,219 --> 03:43:12,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking forward into another year, by bringing on board a facilities calendar, we'll be able to do that in a better way, a more transparent way.

2642
03:43:12,602 --> 03:43:16,123
[SPEAKER_15]: But at this point, I expect the bottom line to be absorbed by those programs.

2643
03:43:16,984 --> 03:43:19,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Any questions on the pool for myself or Rachel?

2644
03:43:25,386 --> 03:43:26,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Next up is community schools.

2645
03:43:28,867 --> 03:43:31,708
[SPEAKER_15]: Community schools, again, is a very busy program, and I have to thank

2646
03:43:32,347 --> 03:43:35,528
[SPEAKER_15]: and Farina and Bobby and Rachel for helping me with this information.

2647
03:43:36,149 --> 03:43:40,631
[SPEAKER_15]: What I gather from the database does not look like anything that you have in front of you.

2648
03:43:41,191 --> 03:43:48,854
[SPEAKER_15]: The breakouts that you have showing the actual revenue earned, that is provided by community schools.

2649
03:43:49,435 --> 03:43:54,877
[SPEAKER_15]: The way our accounting system works is the deposits are made and then they're lumped by date of post.

2650
03:43:55,457 --> 03:44:00,499
[SPEAKER_15]: So then I ask community schools to pull out that information so that you can see FY 15 revenue.

2651
03:44:02,207 --> 03:44:03,668
[SPEAKER_15]: and FY16 revenue.

2652
03:44:04,129 --> 03:44:08,974
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, of course, the software does provide you with a breakout of expenditures.

2653
03:44:08,994 --> 03:44:11,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay?

2654
03:44:12,497 --> 03:44:14,639
[SPEAKER_15]: The program will end the year in a positive.

2655
03:44:15,099 --> 03:44:21,466
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a lot of revenue not posted yet, which you'll see on your receivable section of the report.

2656
03:44:22,698 --> 03:44:29,541
[SPEAKER_15]: AIC, Bangladesh Group, Impact Church, Japanese Language School, and Tibetans are all invoiced at this time.

2657
03:44:29,981 --> 03:44:32,382
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're waiting for their money to come in and then be posted.

2658
03:44:32,402 --> 03:44:34,583
[SPEAKER_15]: And it should all be here before the end of the school year.

2659
03:44:36,043 --> 03:44:37,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Any questions on community schools?

2660
03:44:39,464 --> 03:44:40,005
[SPEAKER_16]: Any questions?

2661
03:44:40,405 --> 03:44:40,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2662
03:44:41,245 --> 03:44:42,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Benedetto?

2663
03:44:42,245 --> 03:44:42,686
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2664
03:44:43,146 --> 03:44:43,686
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Pat.

2665
03:44:43,746 --> 03:44:48,128
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to say thank you for sitting with me the other day and showing me how to read some of these documents.

2666
03:44:49,368 --> 03:44:51,909
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have quite a few questions regarding community schools.

2667
03:44:52,370 --> 03:44:57,711
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have an estimated amount of what revenue would be coming in from now till the end of the school year?

2668
03:44:58,071 --> 03:45:03,033
[SPEAKER_16]: That would be in the second section of FY16 financial activity receivables.

2669
03:45:03,593 --> 03:45:03,953
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

2670
03:45:04,113 --> 03:45:04,493
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

2671
03:45:04,973 --> 03:45:10,394
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's your AIC, your Bangladesh group, your impact church, Japanese language school, and the Tibetans.

2672
03:45:10,774 --> 03:45:12,355
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the known revenue at this time.

2673
03:45:12,375 --> 03:45:13,495
[SPEAKER_16]: There'll be some smaller groups.

2674
03:45:14,215 --> 03:45:15,796
[SPEAKER_16]: So we project $271,000.

2675
03:45:15,836 --> 03:45:16,196
[SPEAKER_16]: Coming in yet.

2676
03:45:16,216 --> 03:45:16,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Coming in.

2677
03:45:16,556 --> 03:45:16,596
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

2678
03:45:22,225 --> 03:45:31,468
[SPEAKER_16]: When we initially got the community schools budget, it had a negative balance of $95,000 at a subcommittee meeting that has been.

2679
03:45:32,068 --> 03:45:33,388
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that's the Edgeley.

2680
03:45:33,969 --> 03:45:34,729
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that's the Edgeley.

2681
03:45:34,789 --> 03:45:35,169
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

2682
03:45:35,209 --> 03:45:36,009
[SPEAKER_16]: It's my mistake.

2683
03:45:36,089 --> 03:45:38,070
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, community schools has always been in the positive.

2684
03:45:38,390 --> 03:45:38,570
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

2685
03:45:38,950 --> 03:45:39,350
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

2686
03:45:39,490 --> 03:45:45,052
[SPEAKER_16]: And community schools does help pay for a lot of different things.

2687
03:45:45,132 --> 03:45:45,372
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

2688
03:45:45,812 --> 03:45:47,653
[SPEAKER_16]: So getting back on that.

2689
03:45:48,955 --> 03:45:59,304
[SPEAKER_16]: community schools program is changing because of the way that we're going to have people sign up and use the facility with the new software system in the way people pay.

2690
03:45:59,684 --> 03:46:09,173
[SPEAKER_16]: They're going to, they're going to have to pay, they're going to have to apply online with the new format and the new forms that we provided in the new rates that will be

2691
03:46:09,832 --> 03:46:12,433
[SPEAKER_16]: determined at a subcommittee meeting.

2692
03:46:13,534 --> 03:46:33,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so what I would like to also propose is that anyone using our facilities also fills out those same exact forms in that the fee structure is just waived so we can track how much, how much usage, how much, how much community uses we allow at no cost.

2693
03:46:33,604 --> 03:46:36,646
[SPEAKER_16]: So that way we know who's on our building at all times.

2694
03:46:37,415 --> 03:46:43,600
[SPEAKER_16]: in that we can track how many wonderful things, opportunities we give our community to use our facilities.

2695
03:46:44,100 --> 03:46:52,947
[SPEAKER_16]: So at this time, I would like to see that added to the community schools on July 1st when we transfer over to the new programming.

2696
03:46:53,608 --> 03:46:56,250
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would like to make that motion this evening.

2697
03:46:57,091 --> 03:47:00,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Should an application be filled out here regardless of whether they pay or not?

2698
03:47:01,094 --> 03:47:06,318
[SPEAKER_15]: That is the expectation of the group, so that we can track every possible user.

2699
03:47:06,890 --> 03:47:17,192
[SPEAKER_16]: And could we also add a calendar so that way we should know, like anyone in the community can know who's supposed to be on any field or in any part of our buildings.

2700
03:47:17,652 --> 03:47:31,995
[SPEAKER_16]: So if a group is there and a person has rented it, it's very easily bring up the calendar, these people, you've paid for it, you've pulled the permit, you have the time, and the other people have to graciously walk away at that point.

2701
03:47:32,975 --> 03:47:34,755
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the luxury of the software as well.

2702
03:47:35,108 --> 03:47:35,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2703
03:47:35,468 --> 03:47:41,831
[SPEAKER_16]: So we just want to make sure that that's available and implemented July 1st as well.

2704
03:47:42,151 --> 03:47:42,871
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that the plan?

2705
03:47:43,031 --> 03:47:43,671
[SPEAKER_16]: That's our goal.

2706
03:47:44,072 --> 03:47:44,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2707
03:47:45,132 --> 03:47:50,314
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can't tell you how much I love you being in there.

2708
03:47:51,094 --> 03:47:53,075
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just going to say that outside.

2709
03:47:53,195 --> 03:47:59,357
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a couple specific questions about programming that might not directly relate to you.

2710
03:48:00,178 --> 03:48:00,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2711
03:48:01,932 --> 03:48:10,096
[SPEAKER_16]: So the first one is, I noticed that different programs work out, rent our facilities.

2712
03:48:10,597 --> 03:48:22,823
[SPEAKER_16]: And as I was looking through the list, I was wondering if there may be any conflicts of interest with any of our employees working at the school district as well as through any of the rental programs.

2713
03:48:23,724 --> 03:48:29,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Either, for instance, the Middlesex Reds, the AIC program, or

2714
03:48:31,176 --> 03:48:33,057
[SPEAKER_16]: Any other person renting?

2715
03:48:35,338 --> 03:48:44,763
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't want the impression of, I want everything to be on the table and outright and forthright so no questions come to me that I have no answers for.

2716
03:48:45,163 --> 03:48:52,507
[SPEAKER_16]: And so through you to the superintendent, do we have staff that work for these programs that also rent our buildings?

2717
03:48:57,387 --> 03:49:02,389
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not sure of the Reds, because obviously that's a, maybe Bobby can answer that particular thing.

2718
03:49:02,769 --> 03:49:06,990
[SPEAKER_23]: There was one person who was a coach and, you know, was affiliated with the Reds.

2719
03:49:08,771 --> 03:49:11,112
[SPEAKER_16]: As well as other programming like the AIC College.

2720
03:49:11,152 --> 03:49:12,012
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's start one at a time.

2721
03:49:12,112 --> 03:49:15,033
[SPEAKER_12]: The Middlesex Reds, there's no paid employees on their staff.

2722
03:49:15,093 --> 03:49:23,716
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a volunteer coach at the Method High School baseball team who's affiliated with the Middlesex Reds, but no paid personnel.

2723
03:49:23,796 --> 03:49:23,976
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

2724
03:49:24,276 --> 03:49:26,697
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to make sure that if there's any,

2725
03:49:28,903 --> 03:49:44,355
[SPEAKER_16]: We're following the rules in that we're all doing it and it's disclosed so that way people are aware that their relationship with the school department as well as their relationship with any private entity that is renting our school department.

2726
03:49:46,125 --> 03:49:50,088
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not asking, I'm not looking for who does what for which programs.

2727
03:49:50,528 --> 03:49:55,331
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to know that there's no ethics violations and that we are in compliance.

2728
03:49:55,812 --> 03:50:05,078
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't want to vote on something that isn't working in the most transparent way.

2729
03:50:05,279 --> 03:50:05,739
[SPEAKER_16]: That's all.

2730
03:50:06,359 --> 03:50:08,821
[SPEAKER_23]: So you mentioned AIC.

2731
03:50:09,381 --> 03:50:09,562
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

2732
03:50:10,102 --> 03:50:11,363
[SPEAKER_23]: AIC contracts.

2733
03:50:11,970 --> 03:50:16,392
[SPEAKER_23]: with the school department through my office and with Pat Velie.

2734
03:50:16,432 --> 03:50:21,735
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's a direct contract, and we generate about 60,000 a year, is that right?

2735
03:50:21,775 --> 03:50:25,417
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less, depending on the thing.

2736
03:50:25,777 --> 03:50:33,241
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, neither Pat nor I have any affiliation with AIC in any teaching or supervisory role.

2737
03:50:33,521 --> 03:50:34,582
[SPEAKER_09]: American International College.

2738
03:50:34,702 --> 03:50:35,862
[SPEAKER_23]: American International College.

2739
03:50:36,823 --> 03:50:41,165
[SPEAKER_23]: We basically just simply contract with them, and they use our space.

2740
03:50:41,708 --> 03:50:42,168
[SPEAKER_23]: and the like.

2741
03:50:42,508 --> 03:50:51,910
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, we have nobody teaching a course for AIC in our faculty or our administration.

2742
03:50:53,030 --> 03:51:04,993
[SPEAKER_23]: Some of our administrators from time to time supervise practicums for people that are looking for advanced degrees or trying to get licensure.

2743
03:51:07,803 --> 03:51:11,626
[SPEAKER_23]: I think at this point in time, there's maybe just a couple of people that do that.

2744
03:51:13,107 --> 03:51:16,070
[SPEAKER_23]: Beverly Nelson does some of that, as does Diane Caldwell.

2745
03:51:16,590 --> 03:51:21,354
[SPEAKER_23]: But they are not involved in the contractual activities with AIC.

2746
03:51:21,414 --> 03:51:24,937
[SPEAKER_23]: So they have no contact with, in terms of money.

2747
03:51:24,957 --> 03:51:26,278
[SPEAKER_23]: So I don't believe they're in conflict.

2748
03:51:26,338 --> 03:51:34,204
[SPEAKER_23]: But one of the things we can do is, going forward, we'll run some of this by Mark Rumley and ask him if he's got any thoughts about it.

2749
03:51:34,224 --> 03:51:35,245
[SPEAKER_23]: And he can check with ethics.

2750
03:51:36,710 --> 03:51:47,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, that's all I'm asking for is to make sure that we're in compliance with all state ethics laws and we're transparent through the community as well.

2751
03:51:48,021 --> 03:51:53,527
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I did not know that AIC was actually an option.

2752
03:51:53,807 --> 03:52:01,054
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe we should open that up and let people in our community know that we have this program at our high school.

2753
03:52:01,514 --> 03:52:07,737
[SPEAKER_16]: as well as our community things, so more people from Medford can take advantage of this college programming.

2754
03:52:08,177 --> 03:52:12,899
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we have these offerings in our high school, and they don't have to go to other towns to go to college.

2755
03:52:12,919 --> 03:52:20,262
[SPEAKER_16]: And if they need to expand their knowledge and their educational base, they can do it right here in Medford.

2756
03:52:20,342 --> 03:52:23,023
[SPEAKER_16]: But I don't know if it's that transparent to everybody.

2757
03:52:23,083 --> 03:52:24,583
[SPEAKER_23]: It's pretty well attended by Medford and others.

2758
03:52:24,643 --> 03:52:28,485
[SPEAKER_23]: But having said that, most of the courses are education courses.

2759
03:52:28,983 --> 03:52:33,724
[SPEAKER_23]: If AIC were to expand or some other colleges were to expand, then obviously they'd offer other things.

2760
03:52:34,324 --> 03:52:40,506
[SPEAKER_23]: But with their education courses, mostly individuals were pursuing graduate degrees in education.

2761
03:52:41,666 --> 03:52:44,627
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's really where it's at at this point in time.

2762
03:52:44,667 --> 03:52:45,787
[SPEAKER_23]: But we can do that.

2763
03:52:45,847 --> 03:52:46,368
[SPEAKER_23]: We can take a look.

2764
03:52:46,928 --> 03:52:49,248
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have another question specific to that.

2765
03:52:52,743 --> 03:52:58,045
[SPEAKER_16]: How many hours are they using our building, and how did we determine what the fee structure was for that?

2766
03:52:58,285 --> 03:53:01,146
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I just want to be transparent here.

2767
03:53:01,206 --> 03:53:02,686
[SPEAKER_23]: We looked at custodial costs.

2768
03:53:02,726 --> 03:53:06,708
[SPEAKER_23]: We looked at, what do you call it, fare costs that we thought were involved.

2769
03:53:07,168 --> 03:53:15,331
[SPEAKER_23]: Basically, they run about four to five semesters, four to five, let's say, periods, four to five session periods.

2770
03:53:16,171 --> 03:53:20,092
[SPEAKER_23]: And generally, it comes out to $2,000 to $3,000 a course, maybe $2,000 a course.

2771
03:53:22,757 --> 03:53:26,140
[SPEAKER_23]: that they're paying us for for the rooms and for the custodial.

2772
03:53:26,160 --> 03:53:27,481
[SPEAKER_23]: So some of them run the same night.

2773
03:53:27,521 --> 03:53:32,985
[SPEAKER_23]: So that mitigates the cost of the custodian because one custodian can cover five classrooms or four classrooms.

2774
03:53:33,606 --> 03:53:34,626
[SPEAKER_23]: So we break it out.

2775
03:53:34,646 --> 03:53:35,687
[SPEAKER_23]: We can give you a breakout.

2776
03:53:35,727 --> 03:53:36,748
[SPEAKER_23]: We can show you what we charge.

2777
03:53:36,768 --> 03:53:38,770
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, and you can actually look at it.

2778
03:53:39,010 --> 03:53:45,415
[SPEAKER_16]: My question about that is, is do they use the same amount of time as our, um,

2779
03:53:46,054 --> 03:53:47,655
[SPEAKER_16]: as the Japanese school does?

2780
03:53:48,256 --> 03:53:51,098
[SPEAKER_16]: And if they do, why is their fee so different?

2781
03:53:51,218 --> 03:53:52,599
[SPEAKER_16]: That's my only question.

2782
03:53:52,679 --> 03:53:55,342
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just trying to make sure apples are apples.

2783
03:53:55,382 --> 03:53:58,724
[SPEAKER_23]: They don't have anywhere near as much coverage of the building as the Japanese do.

2784
03:53:59,225 --> 03:54:02,627
[SPEAKER_23]: They're basically talking five classrooms, maybe three nights a week.

2785
03:54:04,209 --> 03:54:09,273
[SPEAKER_16]: But if you count those hours, if it's six hours and the Japanese school has our building, it's six hours.

2786
03:54:09,313 --> 03:54:11,815
[SPEAKER_23]: It's pretty substantial from what we're getting from them for the time.

2787
03:54:11,835 --> 03:54:13,916
[SPEAKER_23]: But we can show you the break up and you can look at it.

2788
03:54:14,933 --> 03:54:16,694
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry?

2789
03:54:17,534 --> 03:54:17,594
[SPEAKER_23]: The $200,000.

2790
03:54:17,634 --> 03:54:20,895
[SPEAKER_23]: For the Japanese, it's generally $100,000 a year.

2791
03:54:21,296 --> 03:54:23,076
[SPEAKER_23]: That's moved up from $90,000 a year.

2792
03:54:23,116 --> 03:54:24,437
[SPEAKER_23]: We moved that up $10,000.

2793
03:54:24,777 --> 03:54:26,338
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought I saw a line item for $200,000.

2794
03:54:26,378 --> 03:54:27,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's for two years.

2795
03:54:27,958 --> 03:54:30,919
[SPEAKER_23]: That's what it is, the $200,000 from the Japanese.

2796
03:54:30,959 --> 03:54:33,080
[SPEAKER_23]: But that's for two years.

2797
03:54:33,501 --> 03:54:34,081
[SPEAKER_16]: OK.

2798
03:54:34,101 --> 03:54:34,981
[SPEAKER_23]: That's $100,000 a year.

2799
03:54:36,082 --> 03:54:36,302
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2800
03:54:36,622 --> 03:54:39,983
[SPEAKER_16]: It just looks like in the financials that we get, it looks like it's $200,000.

2801
03:54:40,023 --> 03:54:43,445
[SPEAKER_23]: What we do with that, just so you know, we forward fund that.

2802
03:54:43,465 --> 03:54:44,625
[SPEAKER_23]: We ask them for the money up front.

2803
03:54:45,035 --> 03:54:46,816
[SPEAKER_23]: So we're two years ahead on it.

2804
03:54:46,876 --> 03:55:02,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Just for clarity, my goal here is to make sure that we are being transparent, we're following state ethics laws, and we're doing the same amount for them as we are for any other program, especially if our employees are working at this facility.

2805
03:55:02,863 --> 03:55:07,565
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want it to be no questions asked and everything on the table.

2806
03:55:08,006 --> 03:55:09,866
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'll move on to my next question.

2807
03:55:09,886 --> 03:55:10,767
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, custodians would be.

2808
03:55:10,787 --> 03:55:12,287
[SPEAKER_23]: Custodians, it's overtime for them.

2809
03:55:12,688 --> 03:55:12,828
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

2810
03:55:12,848 --> 03:55:13,288
[SPEAKER_23]: They're just there.

2811
03:55:13,848 --> 03:55:15,609
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's part of the contract to have overtime.

2812
03:55:15,649 --> 03:55:18,671
[SPEAKER_23]: But we'll run personnel by Mark.

2813
03:55:19,251 --> 03:55:24,854
[SPEAKER_23]: And let him take a look and see if there's anything he sees that's, you know.

2814
03:55:24,874 --> 03:55:25,855
[SPEAKER_16]: So I have a lot of questions.

2815
03:55:25,895 --> 03:55:26,435
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

2816
03:55:26,535 --> 03:55:35,600
[SPEAKER_16]: But the vocational evening classes and stuff like that, does that come in through those community schools?

2817
03:55:35,700 --> 03:55:36,641
[SPEAKER_16]: Or is that separate?

2818
03:55:36,961 --> 03:55:38,262
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a separate revolving fund.

2819
03:55:38,492 --> 03:55:43,815
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, and where is that accounts and how do we see that?

2820
03:55:44,155 --> 03:55:45,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we see that as a school committee?

2821
03:55:46,377 --> 03:55:49,158
[SPEAKER_15]: You saw that earlier in the year when I gave you the revolving funds.

2822
03:55:49,478 --> 03:55:49,799
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

2823
03:55:49,919 --> 03:55:53,741
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, this is the first year of evening classes, so there was no balance.

2824
03:55:54,241 --> 03:55:57,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Next year in the fall when you get this year's accounting, you will see all that.

2825
03:55:58,343 --> 03:55:58,784
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that's great.

2826
03:55:58,824 --> 03:55:59,824
[SPEAKER_16]: And it is kept separate.

2827
03:56:00,645 --> 03:56:01,465
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.

2828
03:56:01,745 --> 03:56:05,608
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't want to vote on a budget and be missing pieces.

2829
03:56:06,637 --> 03:56:08,539
[SPEAKER_16]: and I just didn't know how that came into play.

2830
03:56:09,119 --> 03:56:16,045
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so there are a lot of adjusted journal entries on this data, and I know you explained it to me, Pat.

2831
03:56:16,985 --> 03:56:17,806
[SPEAKER_16]: Could you just go over it?

2832
03:56:17,846 --> 03:56:19,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I know there's one for $480,000, 450, 480, I'm sorry, it's late, $553.15.

2833
03:56:20,028 --> 03:56:20,808
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you give me a page?

2834
03:56:20,828 --> 03:56:22,410
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm looking at, hmm, so on page one,

2835
03:56:36,091 --> 03:56:38,032
[SPEAKER_16]: But that page is like five pages in.

2836
03:56:39,973 --> 03:56:40,193
[SPEAKER_16]: FY16?

2837
03:56:40,313 --> 03:56:43,855
[SPEAKER_16]: It's actually June 30, 2015.

2838
03:56:44,635 --> 03:56:48,137
[SPEAKER_16]: It says JE01 Adjustment Budget.

2839
03:56:50,478 --> 03:56:51,198
[SPEAKER_16]: Post errors.

2840
03:56:51,639 --> 03:56:56,161
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to be clear that adjustments are made in this budget.

2841
03:56:58,022 --> 03:56:59,463
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how to read a lot of this.

2842
03:56:59,523 --> 03:57:01,063
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm trying to learn more and more.

2843
03:57:01,323 --> 03:57:04,425
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I believe that you are looking at is an appropriation adjustment.

2844
03:57:05,334 --> 03:57:08,476
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that the city auditor would have made this one.

2845
03:57:09,116 --> 03:57:13,018
[SPEAKER_15]: And she went back and checked the balances to make sure that they were posted correctly.

2846
03:57:13,498 --> 03:57:17,881
[SPEAKER_15]: So this looks like a budget adjustment from her to appropriate the money in the right fund.

2847
03:57:18,501 --> 03:57:22,003
[SPEAKER_16]: So we had the money in a different fund and it moved to this fund?

2848
03:57:23,123 --> 03:57:23,744
[SPEAKER_16]: More than likely.

2849
03:57:23,764 --> 03:57:24,984
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what it looks like to me.

2850
03:57:25,625 --> 03:57:25,865
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2851
03:57:26,185 --> 03:57:27,926
[SPEAKER_16]: So I know we discussed about

2852
03:57:28,537 --> 03:57:31,281
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully looking at different programming.

2853
03:57:31,341 --> 03:57:32,763
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is easier to read.

2854
03:57:33,944 --> 03:57:40,032
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that might be on the city side and maybe some counselors, the mayor might facilitate that.

2855
03:57:40,133 --> 03:57:42,636
[SPEAKER_16]: So this way it's not quite so confusing.

2856
03:57:42,676 --> 03:57:44,118
[SPEAKER_16]: Like for me, this is hard to read.

2857
03:57:44,742 --> 03:57:46,823
[SPEAKER_18]: These are the financial reports, I'm telling you.

2858
03:57:46,843 --> 03:57:48,785
[SPEAKER_18]: They're extremely difficult to read.

2859
03:57:48,805 --> 03:57:51,446
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and I don't know what that means a lot of the time.

2860
03:57:51,486 --> 03:58:05,075
[SPEAKER_18]: So I mean, I don't know if this is looking into a new program, but that would... We did a community compact, and we're going to be looking into trying to get one program that works through our treasury office, our payroll office, and the financial software as well.

2861
03:58:05,615 --> 03:58:06,716
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's being analyzed.

2862
03:58:07,688 --> 03:58:10,311
[SPEAKER_18]: And then hopefully we come up with one program that does it all.

2863
03:58:10,551 --> 03:58:18,699
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want, like, because the documents are out there and they, someone sees that adjustment to the budget, $480,000.

2864
03:58:19,160 --> 03:58:26,967
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it's because an adjustment was made, but it doesn't specify why it was made, how it was made, what budget it came from.

2865
03:58:27,248 --> 03:58:29,350
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's how, that's how we're audited.

2866
03:58:29,690 --> 03:58:31,312
[SPEAKER_18]: We look at the journal entry behind it.

2867
03:58:32,203 --> 03:58:38,587
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's just difficult for me as a school committee member to know all the ins and outs of what's going on.

2868
03:58:39,067 --> 03:58:46,071
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm all in favor of a better programming, so maybe it's accounting 101 instead of 104.

2869
03:58:48,380 --> 03:58:49,821
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so that's that issue.

2870
03:58:50,501 --> 03:58:58,586
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to bring everybody's attention to the overtime for our custodians in this thing is $93,000 a year.

2871
03:58:59,687 --> 03:59:01,008
[SPEAKER_16]: That seems like a lot of money.

2872
03:59:01,328 --> 03:59:02,449
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's overtime.

2873
03:59:02,509 --> 03:59:10,334
[SPEAKER_16]: I know maybe we could figure something out with flexible schedules and next time we negotiate with them.

2874
03:59:10,888 --> 03:59:18,855
[SPEAKER_16]: But if we're spending that much money, maybe we could hire another person and have them do different hours so we're not always paying.

2875
03:59:19,256 --> 03:59:24,520
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd rather give someone a job than if we're going to spend that amount of money.

2876
03:59:24,540 --> 03:59:31,226
[SPEAKER_23]: So you've got to understand that a custodian salary is going to be about $60,000 plus benefits.

2877
03:59:31,827 --> 03:59:34,970
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you add benefits to $60,000, you're almost on top of the 93.

2878
03:59:37,402 --> 03:59:44,490
[SPEAKER_23]: And the flexibility of the schedules and the different places that people have to be at at different times, you know, creates that situation.

2879
03:59:45,911 --> 03:59:50,196
[SPEAKER_23]: We're actually doing very well with the, you know, with the overtime account in that regard.

2880
03:59:50,296 --> 03:59:52,598
[SPEAKER_23]: But it's substantial because there's a lot of programs.

2881
03:59:53,439 --> 03:59:56,142
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, but if you hire one custodian, pay them benefits.
