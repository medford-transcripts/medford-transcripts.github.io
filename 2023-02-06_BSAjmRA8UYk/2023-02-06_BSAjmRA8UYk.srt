1
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:48,060
[SPEAKER_11]: .

2
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,060
[SPEAKER_11]: If we may please call the roll.

3
00:01:24,912 --> 00:01:27,433
[SPEAKER_11]: Would anybody like to start us off on goals?

4
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,075
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin, all you.

5
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:50,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think that, um, you know, the point of having goals was that so that we could identify as in, it says in the, in the MASC, MASS, um, conference handout so that we can identify to the community what our work is, what our goals are and to,

6
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:59,163
[SPEAKER_07]: be able at the end to show some evaluative process about how we attended and reached our goals, much like the superintendent.

7
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:10,411
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that our goals are aligning with the superintendent's goals and that we're being very clear on what our roles as school committee members are.

8
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:16,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, how we can create measurable goals so that we can show at the end of a,

9
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:27,001
[SPEAKER_07]: a term or session, depending on what the committee decides, how we achieve those goals that we said, or whether we achieve the goals that we said, or whether they need to be restructured.

10
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:36,406
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really wanted to open a discussion based on the MASC recommendations for setting goals for school committee around what those could be.

11
00:02:36,426 --> 00:02:47,872
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I think that they are very clear about not setting many, you know, setting, you know, between one and three goals and, you know, and thinking that it could be, you know, sensibly,

12
00:02:48,378 --> 00:03:16,235
[SPEAKER_07]: for the either the school year or since we're so far into this school year it could be january to january sort of leave it open for discussion with the colleagues thanks oh sounds great thank you member mclaughlin so i know i mean i can speak from the chair with regards to setting a process for the evaluation i think that meeting went really

13
00:03:16,803 --> 00:03:23,385
[SPEAKER_08]: well last week, so I'm glad we took that hour to, and I thank the committee members that stepped up and are gonna serve on that committee.

14
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:27,906
[SPEAKER_08]: It should hopefully be a smooth process this spring, early summer.

15
00:03:28,447 --> 00:03:31,527
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was definitely a goal we accomplished last week.

16
00:03:32,648 --> 00:03:38,970
[SPEAKER_08]: But moving forward, does anybody else have any ideas of specific goals?

17
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:40,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Graham?

18
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,152
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in the same vein of establishing

19
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:51,319
[SPEAKER_05]: a better process for the superintendent's evaluation.

20
00:03:51,359 --> 00:04:02,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I see part of that work being like writing down what we did so that the committee is not constantly reinventing the wheel around what we're doing and how we're doing it.

21
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:06,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, especially, you know, there is an election coming up.

22
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:11,486
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing to say that all of us will still be here in our seats a year from today.

23
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:19,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think when you think about onboarding new people to the school committee, it's a really daunting task.

24
00:04:19,212 --> 00:04:35,921
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, in the same vein of putting some structure and process around the superintendent's evaluation, I think putting some thought into like, what would onboarding for new school committee members look like,

25
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,556
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all sort of been through it in our own way.

26
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:42,920
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think nobody has had the same experience.

27
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:48,508
[SPEAKER_05]: And we actually started to identify some rules around that in our rules handbook last year.

28
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:50,030
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we should

29
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:56,936
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, maybe spend some time revisiting like what those rules were particular to onboarding school committee members and really think about.

30
00:04:58,377 --> 00:04:59,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether they're sufficient.

31
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:07,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we haven't had to we haven't had to use them, but we also were trying to adopt like 100 rules at the same time so.

32
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,125
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe there's an opportunity to say, if we're just going to look at that set of subset of rules, like, is it enough?

33
00:05:13,926 --> 00:05:17,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there adequate training around the open meeting law and Robert's rules of order?

34
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,533
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there isn't, can we figure out what we want to do in those regards?

35
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:27,600
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think from a like functioning of the school committee, that would be something that is on my mind.

36
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:31,003
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, you know, to the point of,

37
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:38,564
[SPEAKER_05]: district goals or goals of things that we as a school committee have purview over.

38
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:41,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a list of things that I

39
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:53,927
[SPEAKER_05]: want to see us think about including an earlier budget process that is not us jamming five meetings into a week and a half at the last possible minute.

40
00:05:54,007 --> 00:06:10,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's really unfair to the community when we do those things because it really requires for anyone who wants to pay attention for them to drop everything, reschedule their lives and engage, which is just very hard to do when it gets to be May and into June

41
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:12,694
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one thing that's on my mind.

42
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:36,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, in terms of things we can control from a school committee perspective, a couple of other things I'm thinking about are having an actual debrief about our negotiations in terms of reflecting back on the process that we went through and starting to think for ourselves what we would do differently next time, whatever that might be.

43
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to talk about replacing our assistant superintendents of finance and operations.

44
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:51,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then if I think about things that really, I didn't hear what you said on the last replacing our assistant superintendent of finance and operations.

45
00:06:52,816 --> 00:07:07,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and then if I think about things that impact kids, which I think is, you know, it's easy to sort of sit here amongst adults and, um, talk about a lot of things that impact adults without talking about things that impact kids.

46
00:07:08,673 --> 00:07:18,298
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think a couple of things that come to my mind is, as we've talked about before, does our administrative organization structure support students and teachers adequately?

47
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:25,502
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a question we've asked and really not answered in a variety of ways over the last couple of years.

48
00:07:26,043 --> 00:07:35,948
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other big thing that I think we have coming up and looming in addition to our MSBA application is our bus contract and really thinking about

49
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:44,455
[SPEAKER_05]: expansion of our bus service and eventually potentially being able to not be so reliant on the mpta.

50
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:56,362
[SPEAKER_05]: All of those things start with a procurement that sort of outlines what those goals are so we are not locked into a set number of buses that can't meet those needs.

51
00:07:56,863 --> 00:07:59,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some strategic thinking around that is really important.

52
00:08:01,706 --> 00:08:03,387
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the other

53
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:16,132
[SPEAKER_05]: the other conversation that is a continuing one that is hard to a hard nut to crack is the, you know, expansion or, or lack of expansion of the afterschool program and whether there are additional things we can be trying there.

54
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:19,073
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's like sort of two buckets for me.

55
00:08:19,253 --> 00:08:22,833
[SPEAKER_05]: One is about our structure and our process.

56
00:08:22,933 --> 00:08:28,714
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other is about like things that actually impact kids in the district and what that looks like.

57
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,355
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are some of the things that I'm thinking about and,

58
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:36,727
[SPEAKER_05]: if we're going to take like a six month view, like almost none of those things can be done in six months.

59
00:08:37,087 --> 00:09:00,104
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, you know, I think we'd have to decide on what that term is, like what that length of time is before, um, we decide what the goals are and then, you know, figure out like, I think there's always 99 things to do and how do we come up with like the right number of things that we're going to say are our focus, um, so that we can clearly communicate that, uh, to the,

60
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:04,853
[SPEAKER_05]: people who come to meetings, to the people who don't come to meetings, and everybody else.

61
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:06,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

62
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, member Graham.

63
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:08,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

64
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:10,434
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin and member Hays.

65
00:09:11,214 --> 00:09:11,894
[SPEAKER_08]: And member Kreatz.

66
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:13,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Mr. Stone, I'm sorry.

67
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:17,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I appreciate that.

68
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:20,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think thinking about buckets is a really good idea.

69
00:09:20,436 --> 00:09:25,117
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would agree with structure and process being one of the buckets.

70
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:27,597
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I would say, I guess the other would be impact.

71
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:32,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we really should be thinking about the evaluative process for ourselves as well.

72
00:09:32,616 --> 00:09:43,622
[SPEAKER_07]: So first, I think we need to set a term of what the goal term would be, but then also, you know, what is the process at the end of the term for evaluation in terms of whether we've reached the goals or whether we haven't.

73
00:09:44,162 --> 00:09:46,244
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are other things that I think we should be thinking about.

74
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:54,809
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in terms of, you know, structure and process, I think certainly the onboarding is something that's been discussed among colleagues as well.

75
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:57,050
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the need for an onboarding process,

76
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:11,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, particularly for, you know, especially with a new election coming up and, you know, folks who, um, don't have institutional knowledge, what have you being able to have some onboarding process and also, um, the training that the MASC offers.

77
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:17,599
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, um, I think technically we're required each as school committee members to do the training.

78
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:25,322
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what that followup process is in terms of whether people have actually done the training or not, um, with MASC and how we follow up on that.

79
00:10:25,402 --> 00:10:26,122
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would say,

80
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:40,049
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, both the onboard in terms of structure and process, but the onboarding and ensuring that the professional development slash training is actually happening for each member would be something that I would put forward.

81
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:52,556
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in terms of impact, I think as we're thinking about district goals as a whole, I think we've heard a lot of talk about equity and we've heard a lot of talk about family engagement.

82
00:10:53,217 --> 00:10:55,338
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd really like to think about those two

83
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:57,758
[SPEAKER_07]: aspects of impact.

84
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:01,919
[SPEAKER_07]: How are we actually increasing?

85
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:02,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we increasing?

86
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:04,540
[SPEAKER_07]: How are we thinking about increasing?

87
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:11,041
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we doing to ensure family and community engagement and equity across that?

88
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:15,942
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think there's very data driven ways to measure those things.

89
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:21,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think setting a benchmark for those would be really helpful.

90
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:22,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

91
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:24,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

92
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:25,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hays.

93
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I had a couple of things, too.

94
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:50,034
[SPEAKER_06]: Thinking about the budget process, as member Graham was saying, I think another thing that would be great for us to do within that earlier budget process is how can we bring the community in more on helping us develop the budget and hopefully also as an educational process for the community to understand how we make the budget and, you know,

95
00:11:50,447 --> 00:11:55,508
[SPEAKER_06]: decisions that have to be made, I think that's important for the community to be a part of.

96
00:11:56,188 --> 00:12:07,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as a, that is a part of maybe a larger goal is our role in educating the community about some of these processes and what we do, what it means to set policy.

97
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:10,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to think of some other ones.

98
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:19,634
[SPEAKER_06]: We've talked about these kind of along the way among ourselves, maybe, maybe at meetings, we've talked about how there are certain things where we could hold maybe

99
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:33,203
[SPEAKER_06]: town hall meetings that we could educate the public, or maybe we create videos that could go on our school committee webpage that people could refer back to any time when they want to understand some of the things that we do.

100
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:40,184
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, that kind of view of us as a body that also communicates with and educates the community.

101
00:12:42,444 --> 00:12:42,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thank you.

102
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:44,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Member Kreatz, then Member Mustone.

103
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:46,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

104
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:47,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

105
00:12:47,788 --> 00:12:54,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I, you know, I just jotted down a few goals and a lot of them are similar to what some of my colleagues have talked about.

106
00:12:54,430 --> 00:13:02,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, one of the goals that I thought was important, which we are working on is, you know, improving the superintendent rating process.

107
00:13:03,052 --> 00:13:04,172
[SPEAKER_04]: We just met about that.

108
00:13:04,612 --> 00:13:06,613
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that could be one of our goals.

109
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:07,693
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that we could,

110
00:13:08,207 --> 00:13:10,348
[SPEAKER_04]: accomplished like within the next six months.

111
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:15,390
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was thinking that might be, you know, one of the goals that we could do, cause we are working towards that.

112
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,731
[SPEAKER_04]: It is something that smart goal it's attainable.

113
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:20,031
[SPEAKER_04]: We could do it within the six months.

114
00:13:20,652 --> 00:13:26,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, another, um, piece would be the communication, which is also being addressed.

115
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:30,075
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on everybody's minds and it's on everybody's goal list.

116
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:35,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's being addressed with the superintendent, you know, improving the communication as part of that,

117
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:38,096
[SPEAKER_04]: would be something that we did make a motion about.

118
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:44,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's something we could accomplish, would be looking into improving the internet service at Medford High School.

119
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:51,043
[SPEAKER_04]: We already have a motion in for this, but it's something that's important to all of us during the communication process.

120
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:58,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know for sure if it's obtainable within six months, but it's something that, you know, we made a motion, we're looking into it.

121
00:13:58,427 --> 00:14:01,029
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's no promises, but we are looking into it.

122
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:07,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then along with that would be like improving the climate at Medford high school, which is also being worked on.

123
00:14:07,593 --> 00:14:09,434
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just something that's on everybody's minds.

124
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:16,638
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, at the same time, you know, considering all the schools, K to 12, not just Medford high school, but all the schools,

125
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:23,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, cause I know we, in some of the messages we got, um, you know, some questions were, Oh, is this going to be done for all the schools?

126
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:30,215
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, that's something that, you know, could be done maybe not within the six months, but you know, within the year.

127
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:41,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, and then my question would be for tonight is, you know, are we, are we making a decision on how many goals, like whether it's going to be one, two, three.

128
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:51,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if I was to look at the superintendent's goals, you know, she has the three, you know, high level goals and then the actions that fall underneath.

129
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:59,158
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was, you know, I just, I wasn't sure exactly what we were doing at tonight's meeting, but thank you.

130
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, members.

131
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,648
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

132
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:06,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Two things.

133
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:11,952
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to Member Graham's point about that we might not all be there because there'll be an election in November.

134
00:15:11,972 --> 00:15:13,553
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say this will be my last term.

135
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:20,156
[SPEAKER_01]: So for community members and parents out there, please consider running or consider encouraging friends and family to run.

136
00:15:20,557 --> 00:15:21,237
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a

137
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:31,566
[SPEAKER_01]: An interesting seven and a half years and I think eight years is a good time for a public servant to bow out and let pass on the torch to someone else.

138
00:15:32,406 --> 00:15:40,694
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next one is that recently we've had many emails about arts and music and the benefits to children and teens.

139
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,937
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'd like a goal to be almost a

140
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:53,667
[SPEAKER_01]: a deep dive into our finance department and see if there's places we can expand or ideas that other schools are incorporating that are successful that we could look into.

141
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,489
[SPEAKER_01]: But in addition,

142
00:15:56,768 --> 00:16:00,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to go to two of the concerts in January.

143
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,709
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what month we're in, but they were wonderful.

144
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:08,271
[SPEAKER_01]: And the parents all there and grandparents all had such wonderful things to say about the fine arts department and the music.

145
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:12,391
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know the music department has started the jumpstart camp and has expanded.

146
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's been beneficial to everyone.

147
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:20,953
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, I think expanding fine arts would be a goal for myself and a lot of parents.

148
00:16:20,973 --> 00:16:21,733
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

149
00:16:23,314 --> 00:16:24,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, member Stone.

150
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:39,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I, if you don't, if nobody has any comments right this second, if I can speak from the floor, I think that's a, um, great goal member of stone.

151
00:16:39,703 --> 00:16:57,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that, um, one parent and I think dr. Cushing might've, I've looped him in or he was on the email, um, had mentioned, you know, what we're doing, make, making changes at the high school and that it really should be art focused and in mental health support, which we know we're know we're also providing.

152
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:04,640
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wrote back, I said, right now it's about safety and keeping our kids safe and do what we can to make sure they feel safe.

153
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:21,188
[SPEAKER_08]: But I, so I agree, but I also agree, you know, now that I didn't, I said, I agree that we need the arts in our schools and to expand and to help our students grow in that field.

154
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,229
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, we need to do both at the same time.

155
00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:25,770
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's a really important piece to this.

156
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:34,392
[SPEAKER_11]: member mclaughlin?

157
00:17:34,493 --> 00:17:50,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I think to member kretz's point in terms of thinking about the time frame for this meeting now, maybe even setting some ideas about what we can accomplish in this meeting in one hour and maybe what we can accomplish is how many goals do we want to set

158
00:17:50,803 --> 00:18:08,770
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, when can we revisit what the goals will be specifically, maybe taking some time to think about this for the next meeting, what, you know, say your top three goals are of the things that were discussed and how we might make those measurable would be something that I would put out and suggest I can make a motion in a minute.

159
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:15,192
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also wanted to say to member Hays' point around videos.

160
00:18:15,232 --> 00:18:18,313
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that's a really interesting point.

161
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:19,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that the studio is

162
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,091
[SPEAKER_07]: incredibly underutilized, particularly for getting information out to the community.

163
00:18:25,911 --> 00:18:37,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Ideally, I would love to see videos that were in multiple languages, being able to describe what the school committee does and how we do what we do and how to contact us, I think could be super helpful.

164
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:40,413
[SPEAKER_07]: So I really liked that idea.

165
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:50,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess across the board, and this is sort of the equity piece that I'm talking about folding into each of the goals is how is this information being conveyed

166
00:18:51,022 --> 00:19:02,207
[SPEAKER_07]: and relate to folks that might not typically get the news or the information and how, you know, how is, whether it's through translation or interpretation or access.

167
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:10,931
[SPEAKER_07]: So for any of the goals that we're thinking about, I would, I would ask my colleagues to be considering equity as an underlying aspect of those goals.

168
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:18,475
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would make a motion that maybe in tonight's meeting, we can set the number of goals that would like to consider

169
00:19:19,301 --> 00:19:29,929
[SPEAKER_07]: and perhaps a timeline by which to one, name those goals and two, evaluate those goals.

170
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:47,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so the motion is for tonight's meeting to identify the number of goals that we'll create for the school committee and the date at which the goals will be identified.

171
00:19:48,378 --> 00:19:55,743
[SPEAKER_07]: and then the term in which the goals will be accomplished slash evaluated.

172
00:19:58,825 --> 00:19:59,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Just need a second.

173
00:19:59,585 --> 00:19:59,906
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

174
00:20:02,207 --> 00:20:04,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz.

175
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:07,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call.

176
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:10,433
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

177
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:12,614
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

178
00:20:12,974 --> 00:20:13,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

179
00:20:19,155 --> 00:20:19,956
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin?

180
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:25,941
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess to that end, I would recommend maybe between two to three goals.

181
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:30,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I might say three goals, but I'd be open to my colleagues' suggestions.

182
00:20:31,285 --> 00:20:31,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Hays?

183
00:20:32,766 --> 00:20:40,993
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it would depend on what we're considering to be that goal timeline or the term, because how many we choose.

184
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:45,977
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're only going to the end of this year, then we want to choose accordingly.

185
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:46,578
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we're going to

186
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:50,066
[SPEAKER_06]: start now and go until next January, we might want to choose more goals.

187
00:20:50,086 --> 00:20:58,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we, from the chair, I think we should do the full year, especially if we have multiple meetings on goals, in my opinion, but member Graham.

188
00:20:58,509 --> 00:20:59,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say the same thing.

189
00:20:59,709 --> 00:21:04,070
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we are here together as a group through December.

190
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:12,813
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it makes sense for us to identify what we think we can reasonably accomplish as a group of electeds before those electeds change.

191
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:14,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

192
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:16,350
[SPEAKER_08]: So 11 months with the goals.

193
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

194
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,131
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to respectfully disagree.

195
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:29,015
[SPEAKER_00]: I think brand new school committee members are wholly incapable of engaging in this conversation with the amount of new knowledge that they have.

196
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:43,721
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I can't remember the specifics, my understanding of goal setting that I feel like I went to a session on this at the conference at one point was that they should not be to like the day of the elect or when people are sworn in because

197
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:46,763
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just, it's sort of like your first budget.

198
00:21:46,863 --> 00:21:50,164
[SPEAKER_00]: We all remember our first budget being like, is this for real?

199
00:21:51,784 --> 00:21:56,485
[SPEAKER_00]: And no offense meant to anybody, but the process is completely illogical.

200
00:21:56,585 --> 00:22:04,707
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't know that right out of the gate, a new member is going to be able to set goals.

201
00:22:04,887 --> 00:22:09,927
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a relatively new member who might be able to provide some her own thoughts on that, if she's willing.

202
00:22:09,947 --> 00:22:13,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

203
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:14,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

204
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:20,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think I hear the concern regarding that.

205
00:22:20,974 --> 00:22:33,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I think on one hand there needs to be enough time to reasonably define the goals and enough time to achieve them and enough time to evaluate them.

206
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:37,378
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do think the 11 month process makes sense, especially starting now.

207
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:41,280
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that we've been talking about over a few meetings in terms of setting the goals.

208
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,820
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that we could define

209
00:22:43,523 --> 00:23:10,338
[SPEAKER_07]: a process by which, you know, this, these goals are our first set of annual goals, if you will, are evaluated and that, and then for the January term, potentially let the new school committee decide what their calendar would be for their goals, whether they want to, you know, have end of February to end of February, the following year, since the two year terms are very different and there'll be consistent over that time.

210
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,039
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would, I would,

211
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:18,510
[SPEAKER_07]: lean towards having the 11 months to be able to really meaningful meaningfully address the goals.

212
00:23:22,892 --> 00:23:23,492
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember some.

213
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:27,214
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had a thought that regardless of when we and them.

214
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:30,175
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be.

215
00:23:32,877 --> 00:23:39,600
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't discussed when we we've certainly set when they would end and we have talked about maybe January February we set new ones but

216
00:23:40,302 --> 00:23:44,305
[SPEAKER_00]: when is the planned time to actually meet to evaluate ourselves?

217
00:23:44,325 --> 00:23:54,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think when, if you have new school committee members, one, two, three, whatever, and they're sitting down and they want, they want, they're going to want to talk about the new goals.

218
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:04,360
[SPEAKER_00]: And are they capable of evaluating the current school committee and meeting the goals that we wrote today?

219
00:24:05,882 --> 00:24:07,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, I mean, I realized that sort of is,

220
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:16,748
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, other than the mid, if we do one year at a time, the midterm one, like between elections, we obviously will be able to do that because we're evaluating ourselves.

221
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:29,191
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just thinking like, you know, if we had one or more new members, what is the timeframe we're expecting the new committee to actually evaluate these goals?

222
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:33,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it first meeting of the body January?

223
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:34,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to be like in,

224
00:24:34,868 --> 00:24:39,131
[SPEAKER_00]: June, evaluating a previous year's goals, having set new ones.

225
00:24:39,492 --> 00:24:40,853
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my question, concern.

226
00:24:40,873 --> 00:24:44,015
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have thoughts on the right way to do it, but it's a concern.

227
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:45,517
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Mayor.

228
00:24:46,457 --> 00:24:49,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent has her hand up, and then Member McLaughlin.

229
00:25:08,762 --> 00:25:10,063
[SPEAKER_02]: for September.

230
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:21,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Set it up any way you want it to be, but give yourselves a check on time to just see how you're making progress toward the goals, and then set it as well for yourselves.

231
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:36,672
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think June, January to December are the calendar year, but that's, that could work, because even if the elections take place,

232
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:42,572
[SPEAKER_02]: at the top of the year, as opposed to the mid-cycle.

233
00:25:42,592 --> 00:25:45,333
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a suggestion.

234
00:25:46,054 --> 00:25:46,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

235
00:25:46,934 --> 00:25:55,518
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the calendar year, then you can have a meeting in December and say, this is what we've accomplished, this is what we need to keep on the goals, and maybe even make suggestions for the new committee that will start in January.

236
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:56,519
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that idea.

237
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:58,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Who did I say was next?

238
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Graham, then Member Hays.

239
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,071
[SPEAKER_07]: to the superintendent's point, that was what I was going to suggest.

240
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:09,894
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that a new committee should evaluate the old or the previous committees work, especially with new members.

241
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:13,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would do, I would recommend a calendar year, January to December.

242
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:18,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do like the idea of quarterly, even quarterly, frankly, check-ins.

243
00:26:18,197 --> 00:26:30,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, mid-year, you know, you know, semi-annually is fine, but I think even quarterly, so that we're, you know, at least having once on the agenda of goals, and it could be under good of the order or whatever, you know, just that we are doing a check-in.

244
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,766
[SPEAKER_07]: to see where we are at is a great idea.

245
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:40,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I think calendar year would be great.

246
00:26:40,427 --> 00:27:00,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to make a motion that we look at our goals timeline to conclude on november 30 so there is the month of december for us to do that evaluation reflection and perhaps

247
00:27:02,075 --> 00:27:04,277
[SPEAKER_05]: sending some information forward.

248
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:16,909
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like the idea of the timeline officially concluding in November so that we then can use December to sort of tidy things up for the next committee, whoever they are when they come in.

249
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

250
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:21,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Before the motion is called, member Hays.

251
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:25,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to, you know, member Ruseau had

252
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:29,139
[SPEAKER_06]: asked if I had any thoughts about it.

253
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:35,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think it would be a lot for a new member to step in and try to help set goals for something they've never been a part of.

254
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:44,229
[SPEAKER_06]: So as for that piece of information, I mean, I do think that would be hard and depending on how many new members we have, that could make it a really difficult process.

255
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:53,656
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing I'm wondering is, you know, when I looked through all these documents, it seemed the idea of all the goal setting is from the top down, right?

256
00:27:53,676 --> 00:27:55,437
[SPEAKER_06]: That our goals should

257
00:27:56,853 --> 00:28:00,895
[SPEAKER_06]: the superintendent's goals coincide with the goals all the way down.

258
00:28:00,975 --> 00:28:16,803
[SPEAKER_06]: So if everyone else is working on basically a september to june, maybe it doesn't make a difference, but I just wanted to throw that out there that if we're working on a different timeline, but all of our goals are supposed to work together, you know, does that make a difference?

259
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:36,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it makes sense to set our goals after the superintendent sets hers, who's in the schools probably 80 hours a week and knows the ins and outs versus us that are part-time, but try to stay involved as much as we can.

260
00:28:37,979 --> 00:28:39,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Member, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

261
00:29:55,388 --> 00:29:57,069
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I had the wrong mic.

262
00:29:57,849 --> 00:29:58,490
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not working.

263
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:58,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

264
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:01,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I apologize.

265
00:30:01,672 --> 00:30:12,818
[SPEAKER_03]: What I was just sharing with the committee was that goals can be multi-year goals and that when I originally came on board, I had a multi-year goal

266
00:30:13,658 --> 00:30:21,946
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at elementary mathematics at that point in time, that was a decision, was a data informed decision based on where we were performing.

267
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:33,797
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the committee were to select a goal that could expand over multiple years, we could just put in benchmarks to say at this point in time, this is what we would like to see.

268
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:36,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, year two, this is

269
00:30:37,275 --> 00:30:39,238
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what else we would like to see.

270
00:30:39,638 --> 00:30:42,382
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a lot of options of multi year goals.

271
00:30:43,683 --> 00:30:52,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if the superintendent's evaluation timeline had to shift to be aligned with the school committees,

272
00:30:53,081 --> 00:31:05,606
[SPEAKER_03]: that that's an option as well, that it doesn't have to be September to June, it could be January to November 30th or January to December and say, this is what happened during the calendar year.

273
00:31:06,486 --> 00:31:22,392
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a lot of, I think, flexibility available, but I think the fact that you as a committee are going through this exercise to think about your own goals and how they align to the superintendent's goals,

274
00:31:22,953 --> 00:31:30,298
[SPEAKER_03]: even if they change and they evolve, and how they align to the district's goals, that that is a step in the right direction.

275
00:31:31,238 --> 00:31:31,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

276
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

277
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:45,227
[SPEAKER_08]: So it looks like we have a motion on the floor to have goals be set from approximately now until November, with a meeting in December to tidy things up and go over the goals.

278
00:31:46,247 --> 00:31:48,989
[SPEAKER_08]: On the floor by Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

279
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:49,850
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

280
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:50,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

281
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:51,791
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

282
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:53,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

283
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,140
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mayor?

284
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

285
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:04,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to make a motion that we set three goals for the term.

286
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:10,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion by Member McLaughlin that we try to set three goals.

287
00:32:10,865 --> 00:32:15,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Member Hays.

288
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:16,447
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

289
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,228
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

290
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:18,248
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

291
00:32:18,468 --> 00:32:20,709
[SPEAKER_08]: So three goals from now until November.

292
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:23,872
[SPEAKER_08]: with a meeting to tidy up things in December.

293
00:32:23,892 --> 00:32:48,204
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're gonna go through what was listed today from communications to budget to replacing our assistant superintendent of finance and operations, MSBA, resubmitting that application in April, MBTA, afterschool programming, MCAS training, equity, family engagement, climate at Medford High School and the rest of the schools, expanding fine arts.

294
00:32:48,224 --> 00:32:50,445
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna digest that all and come back

295
00:32:51,019 --> 00:33:01,786
[SPEAKER_08]: the next in a few weeks to um hopefully in between we will have things written out and we can try to finalize our goals in a good 30-40 minutes.

296
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:03,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Sound great.

297
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:20,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to ask if we could get a list of the proposed goals from tonight so that we can all have a opportunity to look through them and consider them for the three and then if there's you know ones that anyone wants to add or flesh out they can and then it um

298
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:26,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Do folks feel like the next meeting is reasonable for the next opportunity to decide on those, or?

299
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:32,751
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be two to three weeks, I think that's reasonable.

300
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:34,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

301
00:33:35,112 --> 00:33:46,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you want it on the agenda so we don't have to, okay, we'll put it on the agenda, hopefully it can come prepared and ready so that we can move approval on three goals at our next regularly scheduled meeting.

302
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,461
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mayor?

303
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:49,617
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin.

304
00:33:49,797 --> 00:33:56,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we just need to decide finally on an evaluation process for that, for the goals in November.

305
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:05,203
[SPEAKER_07]: So we said we'd discuss November, have a discussion in December, but I think we need to establish some sort of process by which we're evaluating.

306
00:34:05,683 --> 00:34:10,005
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will have on the agenda to identify goals and establish a process for evaluation.

307
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:11,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

308
00:34:12,706 --> 00:34:16,767
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the superintendent and myself took notes at this meeting, so one of us can

309
00:34:17,727 --> 00:34:19,529
[SPEAKER_08]: and Marky I'm sure did too, so we can write them up.

310
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, is there a motion to adjourn?

311
00:34:22,151 --> 00:34:22,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

312
00:34:22,892 --> 00:34:27,216
[SPEAKER_08]: 10 minute break before our six o'clock meeting by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

313
00:34:27,236 --> 00:34:28,016
[SPEAKER_08]: All those in favor?

314
00:34:28,437 --> 00:34:28,517
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

315
00:34:28,637 --> 00:34:29,357
[SPEAKER_08]: All those opposed?

316
00:34:29,397 --> 00:34:30,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion passes.

317
00:34:30,458 --> 00:34:33,041
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back at you in 20 minutes.
