1
00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:04,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go ahead and get started so that we can get finished.

2
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:07,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:08,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Peter.

4
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:10,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.

5
00:00:10,435 --> 00:00:11,695
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so please be advised.

6
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:13,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to read the posting and then.

7
00:00:13,476 --> 00:00:15,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Recording in progress.

8
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:16,857
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a recording going here.

9
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:21,501
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna read the posting and then we can have some discussion.

10
00:00:22,382 --> 00:00:25,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Please be advised that on May 7th, 2024 at 6 p.m.

11
00:00:25,063 --> 00:00:30,526
[SPEAKER_01]: there'll be an MSBA rules and onboarding subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via Zoom.

12
00:00:30,646 --> 00:00:39,711
[SPEAKER_01]: The meeting can be viewed live on the Medford Public Schools YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable, Comcast Channel 9, 8 or 22 and Verizon Channel 43, 45 or 47.

13
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:40,832
[SPEAKER_01]: The meeting will be recorded.

14
00:00:43,553 --> 00:00:47,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log in by using the following link or call-in number.

15
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:51,921
[SPEAKER_01]: The meeting ID is 922-9520-7627.

16
00:00:55,204 --> 00:01:01,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions and comments can be submitted to me during the meeting by emailing Jenny Graham at medford.k12.ma.us.

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,395
[SPEAKER_01]: Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, and your question or comment.

18
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:11,757
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I will do a quick roll call.

19
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:13,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Rousseau.

20
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:17,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Present.

21
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Tracy Keene.

22
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:20,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Present.

23
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:22,150
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron Olopade.

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Present.

25
00:01:24,604 --> 00:01:26,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Emily Lazaro, I don't see her.

26
00:01:27,305 --> 00:01:31,667
[SPEAKER_01]: She probably has a conflict for this evening with the council.

27
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:33,407
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jenny Graham here.

28
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:38,549
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, two, three, four present, one absent.

29
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:43,691
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will get started.

30
00:01:45,932 --> 00:01:51,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that all of that's out of the way, what I'm hoping we can do tonight is just come up with

31
00:01:54,233 --> 00:02:04,183
[SPEAKER_01]: some simple but effective operating rules for the committee, just so that we all can have a common grounding of how we're going to operate these meetings, because the team is very large.

32
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:15,855
[SPEAKER_01]: And talk specifically about public participation in our full team meetings, and consider whether we want to adopt the same public participation policies as we use at the school committee.

33
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:25,561
[SPEAKER_01]: And then talk about any other onboarding activities that we want to bring to the group so that we can start to think about like, what those are.

34
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:27,982
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of the broad agenda.

35
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,143
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a small group.

36
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:32,204
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be some people watching and it is being recorded.

37
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:36,347
[SPEAKER_01]: So people will be able to watch later, but I'm perfectly okay with us having.

38
00:02:37,187 --> 00:02:40,588
[SPEAKER_01]: just a sort of conversation and coming to some consensus.

39
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:43,270
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the meeting, we'll take a vote on whatever it is that we have.

40
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:50,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will bring that back to the main meeting next week for review, editing, et cetera, by the larger committee.

41
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:51,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?

42
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:52,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

43
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:53,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions?

44
00:02:54,774 --> 00:03:02,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, Graham, I do have a document with a set of rules if we want to work from the document first.

45
00:03:03,338 --> 00:03:03,878
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love that.

46
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I shall share.

47
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:12,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

48
00:03:13,176 --> 00:03:16,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you just confirm that you can't hear the video game console in my living room?

49
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:19,157
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot hear any video games.

50
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:20,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful.

51
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:21,418
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just

52
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:37,505
[SPEAKER_05]: My musings, so that's so I'm just going to go through them real quick.

53
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:43,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think we can talk about them and talk about what's missing and obviously anybody's opinions on the things here.

54
00:03:43,507 --> 00:03:44,948
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 1st 1 is.

55
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:56,357
[SPEAKER_05]: The full name of the committee, we will use the acronym SBC, which is actually what it looks like a lot of other places use in documentation and other written works.

56
00:03:56,457 --> 00:04:03,563
[SPEAKER_05]: However, the first time SBC is used within any document, we'll actually write out the whole thing so that it doesn't become an acronym nightmare.

57
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:11,369
[SPEAKER_05]: But the intent here is that every single thing we write is not 14 pages long because it's such a long name.

58
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,693
[SPEAKER_05]: The SBC will operate following Robert's Rules of Order.

59
00:04:17,114 --> 00:04:40,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of the SBC are urged to, A, speak for themselves using I statements, allow for one speaker at a time, be present, engaged, and prepared, engage in open, honest conversations, assume best intentions, and understand, well, I fixed that sentence there, and understand, or,

60
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:51,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Acknowledge intent, hold themselves and 1 another accountable before public participation will be added to agendas on an as needed basis.

61
00:04:51,438 --> 00:04:51,598
[SPEAKER_05]: This 1.

62
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:53,299
[SPEAKER_05]: I just was like, I don't know.

63
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:54,560
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to add it to every agenda.

64
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, but I just started there figuring we could work up to something else.

65
00:05:00,923 --> 00:05:06,110
[SPEAKER_05]: All meetings of the SBC or any subcommittees of the SBC shall operate in accordance with the open meeting law.

66
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:14,320
[SPEAKER_05]: The SBC shall, to the best of its ability, ensure that all meetings are recorded by Medford's Public Media and broadcast live to the district YouTube channel.

67
00:05:19,205 --> 00:05:35,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Communications for the SBC will, and I know, I don't remember if this was in the application or where I have seen this language would be written at somewhere else, but it's like the chair speaks for the committee, or I don't remember what we had, but I was trying to find that language and I didn't wanna rewrite it from scratch.

68
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:47,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this one here, number seven, at our last meeting, our first meeting, all of the people who are members voting and non-voting

69
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:52,114
[SPEAKER_05]: were called to see whether you were there, which everybody can agree makes sense.

70
00:05:53,335 --> 00:06:04,306
[SPEAKER_05]: But when we were voting to adjourn, I realized that the commencement of a meeting when we take a roll call is actually doing dual duty.

71
00:06:05,146 --> 00:06:09,170
[SPEAKER_05]: It is who's here, and it's actually a vote to begin the meeting.

72
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:16,424
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I think that we still, non-voting members should be, are you here?

73
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:22,447
[SPEAKER_05]: But during the vote to adjourn, it is actually a very specific thing about ending the meeting only.

74
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:31,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I did talk to Jenny about, you know, should non-voting members be voting to adjourn?

75
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:35,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And after I started talking to her, I was just banging around on my head for a couple of days.

76
00:06:35,614 --> 00:06:42,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I realized we definitely should not, I don't think, be voting to adjourn a meeting because

77
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:45,637
[SPEAKER_05]: You need a majority of the folks to churn.

78
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I live on the train tracks.

79
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:53,499
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that the end of the meeting, people are tired.

80
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:03,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, one of the things that has happened in open meeting law is that failures to properly adjourn a meeting, there's plenty of open meeting law violations around that.

81
00:07:05,102 --> 00:07:12,526
[SPEAKER_05]: and like host town councils, you know, the annual meetings, they have to come back together to vote to end the meetings, really dumb.

82
00:07:12,926 --> 00:07:17,028
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanna make sure that the ending of the meeting is fully crystal clear.

83
00:07:18,288 --> 00:07:28,753
[SPEAKER_05]: The only squishy thing here is that the beginning of the meeting, whoever's taking the role does have to have like a voting member, non-voting member,

84
00:07:29,697 --> 00:07:36,961
[SPEAKER_05]: on the piece of paper or the document they're doing so that they can make sure there's a quorum of voting members to begin the meeting.

85
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:39,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very doable.

86
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:44,044
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a little more complicated than I think I'd imagined.

87
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,465
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have anything else other than this.

88
00:07:47,005 --> 00:07:49,627
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's stuff people think needs to be added or changed, let me know.

89
00:07:58,884 --> 00:08:11,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one thing, I was just looking through our approved resolution to see if it was in there, that the placeholder that you have around communications being directed to the chair.

90
00:08:13,195 --> 00:08:21,822
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did not find it there, so I don't, it must exist somewhere in the ether, but I think the answer there is, you know,

91
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:49,646
[SPEAKER_01]: media requests for communication or comment regarding the SBC will be directed via me so that the committee knows that if they get a press request, that if the request is about speaking about what's happening on the committee, that that should come to me so that I can work with the right people to make sure that whatever we say is appropriate.

92
00:08:55,242 --> 00:09:07,981
[SPEAKER_01]: I was also wondering whether I think public participation, I would personally like to see us adopt the same roles that we have for school committee around like

93
00:09:09,223 --> 00:09:13,146
[SPEAKER_01]: you can speak one time on a matter for up to three minutes.

94
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,988
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some specific language there in our rules document.

95
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:30,477
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you all feel about that in terms of like, you know, I don't think we're gonna see a lot of public participation in this like phase, but I think at some point we will, you know, when we're making like feasibility decisions.

96
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:31,358
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just curious,

97
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:36,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, can we sort of agree now what that looks like?

98
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:39,063
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just trying to pull up our rules document to grab.

99
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I already got it, John.

100
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:44,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you have it.

101
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:46,068
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

102
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:51,832
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think that has to be the answer, but I think it is actually already documented.

103
00:09:51,892 --> 00:10:00,958
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should work from it and say that that's sort of what we're proposing.

104
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,893
[SPEAKER_01]: So public comment will be limited to three minutes per individual and will be limited to those matters on the agenda.

105
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:15,635
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important because when we don't do that, we sort of bump into open meeting law issues.

106
00:10:16,175 --> 00:10:20,217
[SPEAKER_01]: The chair may limit comment to two minutes based on the number of individuals wishing to speak.

107
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:26,114
[SPEAKER_01]: The chair will announce the time limit prior to the public comment period at every meeting.

108
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:33,080
[SPEAKER_01]: The public will also be encouraged to submit their comments in writing or by email or by emailing them to the superintendent.

109
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I would maybe say the chair.

110
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:44,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Written comments will be forwarded to all members of the school committee.

111
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:55,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim, I guess I'm wondering, do we set up an auto forward situation?

112
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:59,839
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I believe that we'll have a general email box again.

113
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:08,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we can do is set up like an auto forward so that if something is coming into that box, it is being distributed to everybody.

114
00:11:08,045 --> 00:11:16,451
[SPEAKER_05]: So I changed the chair to actually be the SPC email.

115
00:11:18,513 --> 00:11:18,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

116
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:22,685
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

117
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:46,193
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't think we need that last sentence.

118
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:47,393
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

119
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Thoughts about that from a public participation perspective?

120
00:11:54,267 --> 00:12:01,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I like it.

121
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:03,653
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think I wrote that language before.

122
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:21,045
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you want to take out email, I mean,

123
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:22,821
[SPEAKER_04]: or by mailing?

124
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:27,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that seems like if you were sending it via post.

125
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:29,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Where am I looking at?

126
00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:36,027
[SPEAKER_04]: The public will also be required for your cursors, writing either by email or by mailing.

127
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

128
00:12:39,388 --> 00:12:48,732
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because I guess I guess what the school can be to be a mailing address or how do you three get if someone wants to mail.

129
00:12:51,265 --> 00:12:56,288
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm fine with just email.

130
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:56,628
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

131
00:12:57,048 --> 00:12:57,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Email.

132
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:57,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

133
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Comments in writing by email to the SBC.

134
00:13:02,892 --> 00:13:04,633
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

135
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:08,835
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll replace that with the name of the actual email address once we have one.

136
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:09,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

137
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,218
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would just say via auto forwarding.

138
00:13:38,686 --> 00:13:43,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I muted?

139
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:44,471
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not muted.

140
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:48,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I go back to number three?

141
00:13:48,434 --> 00:13:49,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

142
00:13:49,795 --> 00:13:54,840
[SPEAKER_04]: And ask a non-elected official question.

143
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:55,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

144
00:13:57,686 --> 00:14:17,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I have three elected officials, and Jenny, when you called, rolled, you say member, I noted at our meeting, we address superintendent, we address, obviously, out of decorum, Jenny as chair, mayor, what what is the proper

145
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:27,700
[SPEAKER_04]: What should members of the SBC be urged to address fellow members of the committee?

146
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,781
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have thoughts on that.

147
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, well, Robert's Rules of Order does say that.

148
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:47,126
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the most common mistakes about understanding Robert's Rules of Order is that literally all of the rules can just be changed on the fly by the chair.

149
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:54,037
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a set of rules of which can be completely thrown out the window at the blink of an eye, which.

150
00:14:55,298 --> 00:14:58,741
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, if you haven't thrown them out the window, then we should be following them, but.

151
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:03,325
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, my, my personal opinions on this is that for subcommittees.

152
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:08,510
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I don't think we'll have committees at the whole kind of a thing for the this particular.

153
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:12,113
[SPEAKER_05]: For the school building committee, but, you know.

154
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,183
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally prefer first names and just the collegiality that we'll have in a small group.

155
00:15:21,924 --> 00:15:40,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I do think in a large group when there's no public present and we're not making a big decision, you know, we're working through documents and, you know, I just, I tend to prefer more collegial, you know, collegial is not the right word, but, you know.

156
00:15:40,435 --> 00:15:40,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Informal.

157
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:42,236
[SPEAKER_05]: Informal.

158
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Matt.

159
00:15:43,457 --> 00:15:47,340
[SPEAKER_05]: But then, you know, we are being recorded and broadcast.

160
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:58,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very much open to always using, you know, the proper, you know, member, all the party member team, you know, I mean, we don't.

161
00:16:02,052 --> 00:16:09,578
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of benefits to both, in my opinion, and it sometimes depends on who the folks are.

162
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:12,684
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're actually, who is the rest of the committee?

163
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:23,552
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, like if we don't have any kind of significant personality conflicts in the school building committee, I'll just, I don't know how else to describe it.

164
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:25,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Like everybody gets along with everybody.

165
00:16:25,293 --> 00:16:26,534
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody's interrupting anybody.

166
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:31,337
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, being less formal seems real easy.

167
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:37,102
[SPEAKER_05]: If the chair has to wrangle the group,

168
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:57,644
[SPEAKER_05]: on a regular basis, then that becomes more, it becomes less, you know, you know, Paul, stop talking is much less, you know, doesn't sound great compared to, you know, remember or so your time is up or, and I feel like we don't know that stuff yet.

169
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:02,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all over the place, but that's just my thoughts.

170
00:17:03,882 --> 00:17:18,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally like that I would propose that we write in here a rule that says we are residents and neighbors here in Medford.

171
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:31,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such, we will address each other on a first name basis, unless otherwise requested by a member of the committee.

172
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:37,467
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want me to call you Mr. Rousseau, I'm happy to do that.

173
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:41,387
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think my strong preference is people call me Jenny.

174
00:17:44,408 --> 00:17:50,029
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all like friends and neighbors here trying to work hard to get something done.

175
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:57,070
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want people to feel like they're part of a team instead of part of a body of elected people.

176
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're not, right?

177
00:17:58,351 --> 00:17:59,311
[SPEAKER_01]: We're appointed.

178
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:07,684
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, that seems like maybe it'll work till it doesn't.

179
00:18:09,847 --> 00:18:11,630
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know what you guys think of that.

180
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:35,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it works for me because it also then while we there is hierarchy in the committee, because obviously we have a chair, but it's for me, as you were just saying, where we're not elected, where have been appointed.

181
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:48,250
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like the idea of trying to find trust amongst the committee seems to be on a more informal basis than a formality.

182
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:51,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's just my opinion.

183
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:54,392
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Tracy.

184
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:57,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to ask you to repeat that the train was going by and I disconnected.

185
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:28,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I was supporting what Jenny was saying, meaning that while we're not elected official and we are appointed, it seems like in order to establish a level of trust and the get-go, while there is hierarchy as we do have a chair, and there is obviously non-voting members on the committee, it seems to me, and I love the way Jenny started out, we are residents and neighbors,

186
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:35,574
[SPEAKER_04]: working on behalf of the committee to do this, this hard work.

187
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:37,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

188
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:38,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

189
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:40,096
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron, how do you feel about that?

190
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:42,978
[SPEAKER_00]: I also agree.

191
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:45,879
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's going to be, it is a long process.

192
00:19:45,899 --> 00:19:51,121
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the more that we, I think feels equals as much as possible that allows for a certain sense of like, um,

193
00:19:52,642 --> 00:20:11,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I think community strength that I think I prefer, just because I think having certain titles for people is understandable, and we want to show a certain amount of respect, but I also think that we want to operate as if we're one body, and not where there's a hierarchy where certain people's voices or votes are going to have far more influence than others.

194
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,167
[SPEAKER_00]: for the most part, so I also agree.

195
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:22,631
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's better to try to be as impartial in our communication as possible while also being respectful to people's titles and things like that.

196
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:25,053
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

197
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:25,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds great.

198
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:30,976
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, well, I think it was while Tracy was speaking, I realized there might be two exceptions I just wrote in there.

199
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:32,837
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what you all think on that.

200
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:35,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's fine.

201
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:37,520
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't like that, they can tell us.

202
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,740
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct, right.

203
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

204
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:49,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Tracy, the other question I had for you is, I'm going to make an assumption that you don't know what Robert's rules of order are.

205
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:52,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you do.

206
00:20:53,937 --> 00:21:03,866
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what would be helpful here is to, I don't know, what are the most important rules

207
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:12,955
[SPEAKER_01]: can we write them down so that people aren't like, where do I even find what that means to be able to agree to it?

208
00:21:13,635 --> 00:21:22,462
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I think in my mind, giving them a cheat sheet is good.

209
00:21:22,562 --> 00:21:33,190
[SPEAKER_01]: But even in words, to me, one rule is that voting happens.

210
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:52,008
[SPEAKER_01]: on the committee when there is a motion to do something and a second and possibly debate on that subject.

211
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:02,732
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we maybe don't need to get into if there's too many motions on the floor, you got to stop and dispatch of things.

212
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we need to go there.

213
00:22:06,914 --> 00:22:18,398
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think saying when we have to take a vote, somebody makes a motion, somebody makes a second, we have conversation, and then we vote.

214
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:21,879
[SPEAKER_01]: And under the open meeting law,

215
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:30,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Voice votes are allowed, which means when everybody is in person.

216
00:22:31,002 --> 00:22:33,185
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can just say all those in favor, aye.

217
00:22:33,345 --> 00:22:35,887
[SPEAKER_01]: All those opposed, no.

218
00:22:36,528 --> 00:22:39,912
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as there's no question, that's fine.

219
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:42,595
[SPEAKER_01]: But

220
00:22:44,258 --> 00:22:49,101
[SPEAKER_01]: at any time, any member can simply request a roll call vote.

221
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:51,763
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think that's an important structure for people to understand.

222
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:58,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we're going to not call 25 people, like a 25 person roll every single time.

223
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:04,270
[SPEAKER_01]: But if somebody feels strongly that they need to know where people stand, that that's a possibility.

224
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:22,307
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing about voting that I sort of am wondering about is like, do we call only voting members in the role?

225
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:27,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are we trying to like also record the sort of opinion of non-voting members?

226
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:32,012
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great question.

227
00:23:32,032 --> 00:23:36,174
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, as a non-voting member, I actually

228
00:23:38,892 --> 00:23:46,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't personally feel like I need to make my vote known how I would vote if I had been a voting member.

229
00:23:46,763 --> 00:23:49,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the reason I don't feel that way is that

230
00:23:51,028 --> 00:24:01,031
[SPEAKER_05]: when there is, as in the item just above it, when there's debate, I mean, it's pretty uncommon that people are going to be speaking on a topic and nobody knows how they actually were gonna vote.

231
00:24:01,871 --> 00:24:16,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, in my mind, the role of the non-voting members is like, if I'm gonna have any influence, it's going to be in what I have to say so that the voting members may choose to vote a different way or vote the way I want.

232
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,035
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't,

233
00:24:18,327 --> 00:24:25,692
[SPEAKER_05]: really feel the need for us to record all the non-voting members' opinions?

234
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:28,374
[SPEAKER_05]: When we go to the full committee, there can be a different opinion.

235
00:24:32,677 --> 00:24:43,224
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe another thing about motions that would be important to say is any member may suggest an amendment to a motion.

236
00:24:45,257 --> 00:24:57,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we just say, and the chair will guide the group through the proper way to accept or reject that amendment.

237
00:25:02,206 --> 00:25:05,067
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I don't need you all to know how to do that.

238
00:25:06,348 --> 00:25:09,109
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that happens, I will handle it.

239
00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:12,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will work through it and go from there.

240
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:24,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like looking through my trustee Roberts rules board a book here see what else we're missing.

241
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:31,340
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm very how long it is you're missing a lot but that's because it's ridiculous.

242
00:25:32,007 --> 00:25:42,795
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, one other thing that I was just reading about is there are typically limits to how often you can speak.

243
00:25:43,816 --> 00:25:50,902
[SPEAKER_01]: So Robert's rule says you can speak twice on a topic for, oh, where'd it go?

244
00:25:54,064 --> 00:25:56,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.

245
00:25:56,606 --> 00:25:59,689
[SPEAKER_01]: You may speak and debate twice on any debatable motion.

246
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:05,154
[SPEAKER_01]: on the same day, each time you may speak for up to 10 minutes.

247
00:26:05,434 --> 00:26:07,475
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what Robert's Rules of Order says.

248
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:21,379
[SPEAKER_01]: I would propose that we amend that to be commiserate with what we're allowing the public to do in an event that things are out of hand, right?

249
00:26:26,904 --> 00:26:34,008
[SPEAKER_01]: just so that people understand that once we get to the point where we'll have discussion, and that's one thing.

250
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:51,637
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we get to the point where we're going to take a motion and vote, there is sometimes diminishing return on everybody talking exhaustively why they think the way they think, when really we just need to take the vote and let the vote go.

251
00:26:54,211 --> 00:27:01,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, that becomes a problem when things are contentious, but maybe that's a good place to start.

252
00:27:07,631 --> 00:27:14,115
[SPEAKER_05]: I put this one in here, Jenny G. It's actually something we frequently have even in school committee.

253
00:27:14,175 --> 00:27:19,218
[SPEAKER_05]: And to me, it's always new members that are confused by this.

254
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:27,303
[SPEAKER_05]: But once the voting has begun, there is no motions allowed, no amendments, no conversation of any sort.

255
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,678
[SPEAKER_05]: You can vote no, and then talk about it or make a different motion.

256
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:39,560
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just a constant problem, even with a small group of seven.

257
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,183
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do worry about a large group being like, I got one more thing after we started to take the roll.

258
00:27:53,163 --> 00:28:02,189
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that Robert's Rules of Order talks a lot about is how to reconsider something if you feel like the group has made a mistake.

259
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:19,362
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, do we maybe just put something in there, like if a member of the committee believes a mistake was made and would like to discuss a completed motion further,

260
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,269
[SPEAKER_01]: They simply need to alert the chair and the chair will like.

261
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:30,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Assist through that process, yeah.

262
00:28:31,756 --> 00:28:37,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I agree, except I do think it's important to include the most important caveat.

263
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,705
[SPEAKER_05]: There is the only members that may actually do that.

264
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:41,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Our vote those that voted.

265
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,090
[SPEAKER_05]: for the thing.

266
00:28:44,551 --> 00:28:45,932
[SPEAKER_05]: No, in the winning thing.

267
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:54,877
[SPEAKER_05]: So if a motion was on the floor and it passes, the only members that may, in fact, redo this are those that voted for it.

268
00:28:55,017 --> 00:29:00,140
[SPEAKER_05]: If it fails, the only members that may do that are the members that voted for it against it.

269
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:03,742
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that's a fair and important point.

270
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Because otherwise, you're just going to recycle.

271
00:29:06,304 --> 00:29:09,406
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

272
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:28,244
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do we have any, um, like when it comes to like meeting, meeting minutes and like accurate minutes being taken, you know, these are all going to be recorded and we'd understand that.

273
00:29:28,284 --> 00:29:35,072
[SPEAKER_00]: But have we decided if we're going to, like how we're going to go about having them running down, like who's going to be doing that?

274
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:43,780
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we are required to publish and approve minutes for every meeting.

275
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:54,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there is still some conversation happening about who will be responsible for that.

276
00:29:54,668 --> 00:30:03,773
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something I need to get with the superintendent on to make sure that we have an answer to that.

277
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:28,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing that we might want to mention is like, if we're going to take the agenda out of order, that we need to make an official motion to suspend the rules and take the agenda out of order.

278
00:30:28,652 --> 00:30:34,956
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really because that's a choice that we're making that

279
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:39,441
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts like how the public can participate in that conversation.

280
00:30:39,481 --> 00:30:50,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were wait, if you knew that it was like the last agenda item, and we took it first, like you may miss it completely and not be able to talk about the things that you wanted to talk about.

281
00:30:52,315 --> 00:30:57,220
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think when it comes to making sure that we're appropriately hearing from the public, we want to make sure that we're

282
00:31:01,523 --> 00:31:06,264
[SPEAKER_01]: We just want to make sure that we are not doing that haphazardly.

283
00:31:06,384 --> 00:31:07,004
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put it that way.

284
00:31:25,829 --> 00:31:28,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I've reached the end of my Roberts Rules of Order book.

285
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:39,024
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like if we can work through these, we're probably going to be OK most of the time.

286
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:42,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you agree with that, Paul?

287
00:31:43,587 --> 00:31:44,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I do agree with that, yes.

288
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:49,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I say one too many times, these are living documents.

289
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:52,552
[SPEAKER_05]: We literally can change them on the fly in our meeting with a majority vote.

290
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,894
[SPEAKER_05]: So perfect is not a thing.

291
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:03,888
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just going to say that.

292
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:06,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I ask a question of the three of you?

293
00:32:07,275 --> 00:32:07,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

294
00:32:07,836 --> 00:32:11,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Often in my role as chair of nonprofit organizations, I

295
00:32:12,993 --> 00:32:22,542
[SPEAKER_04]: have the secretary put a lot of the items that are non-controversial on a consent agenda, and we vote the consent agenda all at once.

296
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:29,828
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something that typically happens in school committee or open meeting laws, et cetera?

297
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,233
[SPEAKER_04]: As you were talking about agenda and voting, that just popped in my head, Jenny.

298
00:32:37,015 --> 00:32:38,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do that.

299
00:32:40,173 --> 00:32:47,877
[SPEAKER_01]: We do that with certain items, usually like the minutes and things like that.

300
00:32:48,718 --> 00:33:08,289
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we need to just say something like, the chair will create an agenda and may elect to use a consent agenda to approve non-controversial items in an effort to ensure the meeting moves along.

301
00:33:36,113 --> 00:33:40,677
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking that we should move that number number five that we should move that up.

302
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:49,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe number six because those are like if you only take a couple things away.

303
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:54,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are good things to take away and maybe put them right after number two.

304
00:34:27,568 --> 00:34:29,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what else are we missing?

305
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:39,583
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more than one page, but still seems pretty brief.

306
00:34:40,504 --> 00:34:40,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

307
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:46,511
[SPEAKER_05]: The school committee rules can be bound in a book.

308
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:54,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

309
00:34:55,204 --> 00:34:55,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else?

310
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:58,545
[SPEAKER_01]: We can come back if there is something else that we forget.

311
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:17,074
[SPEAKER_01]: The other topic for us to talk about that we haven't talked about yet is like, if we are thinking about the committee, what kind of onboarding activities and information do we want to make sure the committee has at their disposal?

312
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:33,616
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked to, you know, the three things I put on the agenda are tours, exemplar documents, and any additional training that people feel like they need, and anything else.

313
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:39,941
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some questions that I had more to think through.

314
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:42,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I have had, like, less of an answer about that.

315
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:51,124
[SPEAKER_01]: that's something that is maybe worth talking about as a group here as well.

316
00:35:56,967 --> 00:36:00,710
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I thought about this.

317
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:15,919
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that I struggle with a bit is, well, first of all, we're sort of onboarding as we go right now.

318
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:18,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody is a current member.

319
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:25,873
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, we might be able to just like, I'm sure we have a list of things we could say we should have on that list.

320
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:45,163
[SPEAKER_05]: But it feels more like it should be just a living document as we like, somebody as we are doing meetings, and we're like, you know, somebody new, if somebody was just thinking and paying attention to like, a new person coming in today, without this information, they're coming in in a month, I should say, without this information,

321
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:49,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they really need it.

322
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:54,285
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's the onboarding of, like, this is our set of rules that we just approved.

323
00:36:54,305 --> 00:36:56,487
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, you know, this is the chair.

324
00:36:56,527 --> 00:36:57,629
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the superintendent.

325
00:36:57,669 --> 00:36:58,910
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's everybody's names.

326
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's our email addresses.

327
00:37:01,773 --> 00:37:07,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Those things are basic things for a checklist, which I think we should draft, of course.

328
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:08,940
[SPEAKER_05]: But then.

329
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:16,750
[SPEAKER_05]: thinking about making sure that they're effective, and then they could be coming in in year four of this project for Grand Out Loud.

330
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:19,932
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me feel like that needs to be a living document.

331
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:34,864
[SPEAKER_05]: When we finish all of eligibility, and somebody starts two months into the next phase, we may wanna like flush things off that list rather than saying, here's your 7,000 pages to read now that you're a new member.

332
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:39,568
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my thoughts.

333
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:50,483
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you thinking that we would put that checklist right in here?

334
00:37:50,503 --> 00:37:55,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you thinking like we're going to assign somebody to do that and bring it back?

335
00:37:55,587 --> 00:38:05,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I would rather just refer to it from here and have it be someplace else.

336
00:38:06,013 --> 00:38:11,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I mean, who would maintain it?

337
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:23,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we certainly can start one now and have a list of, you know, the things that are going to stay the same throughout the entire process.

338
00:38:26,194 --> 00:38:34,862
[SPEAKER_05]: Payroll, you know, like the kind of thing you did if you were joining a company, then you sit at your new desk and you have no idea what ends up, even though you've got your account now.

339
00:38:44,524 --> 00:38:44,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

340
00:38:55,188 --> 00:38:57,309
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess me, I guess the chair, right?

341
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, but but committee.

342
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:01,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I like that.

343
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:02,391
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can, you know,

344
00:39:15,682 --> 00:39:24,395
[SPEAKER_05]: meet as needed when we realize, hey, you know, this is no longer what the current list looks like.

345
00:39:25,336 --> 00:39:25,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

346
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:26,318
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

347
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:46,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it seemed like one of the first things we need to do is what we did last week is have an onboarding of open meeting laws.

348
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:47,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

349
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

350
00:39:54,023 --> 00:39:54,723
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you see my?

351
00:39:55,563 --> 00:39:56,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can.

352
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,841
[SPEAKER_05]: Never know when I do that.

353
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:01,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have OML.

354
00:40:01,842 --> 00:40:03,043
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Roberts.

355
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:06,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm just going to say the SBC rules.

356
00:40:09,806 --> 00:40:11,747
[SPEAKER_01]: Issue an email address.

357
00:40:12,427 --> 00:40:16,970
[SPEAKER_05]: SBA process overview.

358
00:40:18,351 --> 00:40:20,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Issue email address.

359
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:24,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Add to distribution list.

360
00:40:31,538 --> 00:40:49,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenny, you know, going back to MSBA process overview, the posting that you shared on Facebook or wherever you laid it out, where we are, it seems a good history lesson of how we got to this point now.

361
00:40:49,726 --> 00:40:52,747
[SPEAKER_04]: And that might be part of that overview.

362
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:54,468
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, agree.

363
00:40:56,361 --> 00:41:01,825
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing, at some point soon, we'll have a website where all of this stuff can live.

364
00:41:01,905 --> 00:41:10,172
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really could be just a matter of somebody from this team sitting and onboarding somebody and walking them through those steps, right?

365
00:41:10,292 --> 00:41:15,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's all there, it gets pretty easy to be able to do that.

366
00:41:15,936 --> 00:41:16,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

367
00:41:16,136 --> 00:41:17,237
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

368
00:41:25,356 --> 00:41:42,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know about a press release every time we add a new member.

369
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,741
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, hopefully that doesn't happen often, but I do think.

370
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:47,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think we really want to do that.

371
00:41:47,501 --> 00:41:50,042
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be some like big changes, but.

372
00:41:54,582 --> 00:42:04,206
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that part of my onboarding for staff at my job, I work at Harvard, and Harvard is known for acronyms.

373
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:23,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wonder, in school committee world, are there acronyms that we need to make sure that everyone knows about or understands or an acronym cheat sheet or something like that, so when people are using short term

374
00:42:24,968 --> 00:42:28,389
[SPEAKER_04]: in reference and people know what they're actually talking about.

375
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:32,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, absolutely.

376
00:42:50,438 --> 00:42:51,339
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and I think that

377
00:42:52,982 --> 00:43:03,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Thinking about coming from this meeting and going to the full membership, you know, I think, you know, my preference is that we actually, like, this is what we send them.

378
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:07,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that the checklist isn't, like, they don't approve the checklist.

379
00:43:08,148 --> 00:43:18,132
[SPEAKER_05]: We want their feedback if they have ideas for more things, but it should just be such a living document that just changes on the fly as anybody and everybody thinks, oh, well, what about that?

380
00:43:19,593 --> 00:43:21,974
[SPEAKER_05]: Rather than it being a policy that we have to, like, vote on.

381
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I agree with that.

382
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,181
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, so I can, I can certainly also.

383
00:43:28,201 --> 00:43:38,383
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if we're not going to vote on this, I'm not going to vote obviously, but, like, if this is not something we're sending to them for approval, then I can work on this list and making it.

384
00:43:38,863 --> 00:43:41,724
[SPEAKER_05]: Look like something useful offline.

385
00:43:45,644 --> 00:43:48,545
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know if we have anything else to add to this thing.

386
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:55,426
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.

387
00:43:55,686 --> 00:43:56,607
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of anything else.

388
00:43:58,589 --> 00:43:59,229
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you all think?

389
00:44:01,351 --> 00:44:05,175
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the brevity, personally.

390
00:44:05,215 --> 00:44:08,317
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too much to wrap your head around.

391
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:16,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we take the chair may limit to two minutes?

392
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:18,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, this is the public comment.

393
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,280
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to keep that.

394
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:20,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, that's the public comment.

395
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,383
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the members thing.

396
00:44:23,143 --> 00:44:23,904
[SPEAKER_05]: It's down below.

397
00:44:23,924 --> 00:44:26,546
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, thank you.

398
00:44:27,006 --> 00:44:27,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

399
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:28,027
[SPEAKER_04]: You scrolled up.

400
00:44:28,648 --> 00:44:30,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, well, up, down, whatever it is.

401
00:44:30,829 --> 00:44:33,611
[SPEAKER_04]: It's number 5C, I think.

402
00:44:34,832 --> 00:44:38,655
[SPEAKER_04]: No, F. Is that what you're talking about?

403
00:44:39,036 --> 00:44:39,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.

404
00:44:39,356 --> 00:44:39,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

405
00:44:39,696 --> 00:44:40,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, that was it.

406
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:41,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, right.

407
00:44:41,718 --> 00:44:42,098
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

408
00:44:46,702 --> 00:44:46,782
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

409
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,681
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, we've got something good here.

410
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:54,965
[SPEAKER_05]: I will, you know, even though I assume that we all will make a vote emotion and vote for this.

411
00:44:55,246 --> 00:44:56,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I will go through real quick and just.

412
00:44:57,267 --> 00:45:01,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Even after the meeting and just make sure we don't have any typos or anything.

413
00:45:01,631 --> 00:45:05,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, just a quick question.

414
00:45:05,334 --> 00:45:08,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we do we have any thoughts about.

415
00:45:12,332 --> 00:45:17,955
[SPEAKER_01]: exemplar documents or districts that we think people should pay attention to?

416
00:45:18,496 --> 00:45:30,523
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a question we can ask the whole group, but I don't want the list to be so big and so long that it's like, I don't have time to sort of go through and find all those documents for all those folks.

417
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:33,505
[SPEAKER_01]: But it might make some sense for us to make

418
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:37,986
[SPEAKER_01]: connections with like Arlington, for example.

419
00:45:38,466 --> 00:45:40,626
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like in the thick of their program.

420
00:45:40,726 --> 00:45:50,209
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, maybe even like Arlington, Somerville, Stoneham, Winchester.

421
00:45:50,229 --> 00:45:51,149
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

422
00:45:51,169 --> 00:45:57,971
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pretty, has done a pretty good job, I think, at keeping their like website, for example, really up to date, I think really detailed.

423
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:00,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that Stoneham you said?

424
00:46:00,571 --> 00:46:00,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Belmont.

425
00:46:01,632 --> 00:46:02,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Belmont.

426
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:02,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

427
00:46:03,072 --> 00:46:03,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

428
00:46:06,747 --> 00:46:07,407
[SPEAKER_05]: One more time, sorry.

429
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:08,588
[SPEAKER_05]: Stoneham.

430
00:46:10,128 --> 00:46:10,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Arlington.

431
00:46:11,549 --> 00:46:12,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Arlington.

432
00:46:13,669 --> 00:46:14,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Somerville.

433
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:18,571
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very interesting.

434
00:46:18,631 --> 00:46:20,252
[SPEAKER_05]: As I looked around, I have very little time.

435
00:46:20,272 --> 00:46:20,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Winchester.

436
00:46:21,252 --> 00:46:21,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Winchester.

437
00:46:23,493 --> 00:46:29,295
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the appeal of Winchester, they've been done for a bit, but they

438
00:46:32,496 --> 00:46:35,397
[SPEAKER_01]: started, I think, with something that looked like Medford High.

439
00:46:35,817 --> 00:46:37,157
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of interesting.

440
00:46:39,597 --> 00:46:40,958
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it looked better before.

441
00:46:42,738 --> 00:46:46,178
[SPEAKER_01]: But they renovated in place, I guess, as it were.

442
00:46:46,198 --> 00:46:48,859
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, they did.

443
00:46:50,299 --> 00:47:00,481
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other question is, is there a Volk district that is succeeding?

444
00:47:01,952 --> 00:47:06,094
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about the places that are having some trouble right now.

445
00:47:06,195 --> 00:47:13,739
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there a VOC district in the area that is sort of succeeding through the process that might be interesting?

446
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:16,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

447
00:47:16,821 --> 00:47:17,581
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there was.

448
00:47:18,522 --> 00:47:24,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we just write vocational question, and we can open that up to conversation.

449
00:47:28,287 --> 00:47:29,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Mohawk, did they do one?

450
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:35,659
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not it.

451
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,420
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean.

452
00:47:39,801 --> 00:47:43,623
[SPEAKER_01]: Members of the committee may have some other ideas, but it would be nice for us to like.

453
00:47:45,063 --> 00:47:46,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Go off and you know.

454
00:47:47,684 --> 00:47:50,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Identify who these districts are and sort of.

455
00:47:52,946 --> 00:47:55,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Accumulate some links to like their relevant documents and that kind of thing.

456
00:47:56,528 --> 00:47:56,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?

457
00:47:56,788 --> 00:47:58,429
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

458
00:48:00,492 --> 00:48:14,965
[SPEAKER_04]: When you list any vocational schools, are there any other schools like Curtis Tufts that has integrated there into a high school?

459
00:48:15,746 --> 00:48:16,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Somerville.

460
00:48:17,067 --> 00:48:18,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Somerville did, okay.

461
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:18,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

462
00:48:20,343 --> 00:48:25,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, my subcommittee on that will be reviewing that.

463
00:48:25,406 --> 00:48:26,546
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget.

464
00:48:26,566 --> 00:48:29,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it next week, maybe, the week after?

465
00:48:29,167 --> 00:48:30,308
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

466
00:48:31,028 --> 00:48:32,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they did do that.

467
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:37,051
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.

468
00:48:37,091 --> 00:48:37,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I have too many meetings.

469
00:48:38,072 --> 00:48:38,712
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't find it.

470
00:48:38,732 --> 00:48:39,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Not tomorrow, I hope.

471
00:48:40,133 --> 00:48:40,333
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

472
00:48:43,294 --> 00:48:47,216
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is also a question as a non-school committee.

473
00:48:49,634 --> 00:49:12,129
[SPEAKER_04]: not necessarily on-boarding but I guess as you list these exemplar school committee building committees are there other areas in the school committee psyche that non people that are you know are there are there places to go in terms of reading making sure you're

474
00:49:13,348 --> 00:49:27,495
[SPEAKER_04]: following them on Facebook or something like that to be in the know of what's happening across the district or in Massachusetts in terms of school committee related issues that pertain to buildings?

475
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:33,298
[SPEAKER_01]: So MSBA has a Facebook page.

476
00:49:34,999 --> 00:49:40,762
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could list that, and we could also

477
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:51,722
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of send reminders when there are scheduled board meetings, regardless of whether we're up or not, because the public can listen in on those meetings.

478
00:49:56,464 --> 00:50:06,946
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the other thing, is the MASC listserv like sort of open to the public, or do you have to be a school committee person for that?

479
00:50:07,326 --> 00:50:09,067
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be a school committee patent member.

480
00:50:10,935 --> 00:50:13,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I do wish they were a little stricter once you weren't a school committee member, but that's.

481
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:21,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Had some former school committee members wreaking havoc, but yeah okay.

482
00:50:23,142 --> 00:50:29,025
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those would be like the two big things and then certainly like if there's something that seems relevant, we can share.

483
00:50:31,853 --> 00:50:41,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking of school committee, Jenny, you will let this committee know, A, obviously, if something is coming before the school committee.

484
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:54,111
[SPEAKER_04]: But are there times when you think it'll be worthwhile that some members or all the committee is present or has some showing at a school committee meeting?

485
00:50:54,131 --> 00:50:56,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

486
00:50:56,733 --> 00:50:57,294
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll

487
00:51:01,722 --> 00:51:10,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of do our best to let, you know, when there's topics that are relevant, like, there's 1, you know, I think on the 20th, we'll have a meeting where we'll be talking about.

488
00:51:12,177 --> 00:51:16,384
[SPEAKER_01]: The school committee will be talking about potential expansion of vocational programming.

489
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:24,915
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be of interest for people to listen in on, albeit not required for you to be there.

490
00:51:25,035 --> 00:51:35,401
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there probably are some big gate style meetings that folks who are able to join would be helpful.

491
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:37,723
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can certainly let people know that.

492
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:42,253
[SPEAKER_01]: as it happens.

493
00:51:43,155 --> 00:51:48,708
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say attendance is not mandatory to those things.

494
00:52:24,587 --> 00:52:25,127
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

495
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we done an hour in advance?

496
00:52:39,231 --> 00:52:39,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

497
00:52:39,951 --> 00:52:46,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to the onboarding, should we make any reference to cadence of meetings?

498
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:52,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Or or how often giving people the meeting schedule that would probably be really helpful.

499
00:52:52,192 --> 00:52:52,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

500
00:53:02,004 --> 00:53:02,244
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

501
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:10,689
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the actual act of deciding, I mean, of selecting an additional member is not going to be in here.

502
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:15,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's also not going to be, there's not going to be one path.

503
00:53:17,252 --> 00:53:21,234
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if Jenny spoke about it in our last meeting.

504
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:27,418
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that is all left to the chair via the resolution.

505
00:53:28,158 --> 00:53:28,418
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

506
00:53:29,939 --> 00:53:31,060
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, like if we lose,

507
00:53:32,953 --> 00:53:45,445
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, some kind of specific kind of engineer and we have another specific, that same kind of engineer in the queue of people who applied, then, you know, the chair will probably want to replace them with that person.

508
00:53:45,585 --> 00:53:50,991
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's, it's hard to formulate, be formulaic about that stuff.

509
00:53:52,252 --> 00:53:52,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

510
00:53:52,893 --> 00:53:53,013
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

511
00:53:53,855 --> 00:54:03,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously that, you know, when the chair's asking somebody if they want to take a seat, you know, the meeting schedule will be important so that they can see the meetings.

512
00:54:04,761 --> 00:54:05,241
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.

513
00:54:07,082 --> 00:54:07,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

514
00:54:18,095 --> 00:54:23,778
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not a voting member, but I'll just, I mean, actually there's two school committee members here.

515
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:25,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to tell you all how to make a motion.

516
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:41,446
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there a motion to approve these rules and onboarding checklist to the SPC?

517
00:54:42,486 --> 00:54:43,006
[SPEAKER_04]: So moved.

518
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:45,687
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there a second?

519
00:54:47,689 --> 00:54:49,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Seconded by member Olopade.

520
00:54:51,431 --> 00:54:52,552
[SPEAKER_01]: So roll call.

521
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:55,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Member Olopade?

522
00:54:55,633 --> 00:54:55,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

523
00:54:59,055 --> 00:55:02,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Aaron, oh my, Tracy Keene.

524
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,161
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be a hard habit to break, Jenny.

525
00:55:07,342 --> 00:55:07,782
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

526
00:55:09,563 --> 00:55:09,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

527
00:55:10,804 --> 00:55:13,066
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jenny and myself, Jenny Graham, yes.

528
00:55:13,106 --> 00:55:15,628
[SPEAKER_01]: So three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

529
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:18,930
[SPEAKER_01]: We will report this out to the full committee next week.

530
00:55:20,351 --> 00:55:21,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

531
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:23,494
[SPEAKER_04]: So moved.

532
00:55:26,547 --> 00:55:29,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to adjourn by Tracy Keene, seconded by?

533
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:30,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

534
00:55:32,092 --> 00:55:34,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron Olopade, roll call.

535
00:55:34,455 --> 00:55:35,115
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron Olopade?

536
00:55:35,135 --> 00:55:35,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

537
00:55:36,497 --> 00:55:37,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Tracy Keene?

538
00:55:37,738 --> 00:55:38,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

539
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:39,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jenny Graham?

540
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:39,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

541
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,501
[SPEAKER_01]: Three in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

542
00:55:41,621 --> 00:55:42,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Meeting is adjourned.
