    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=0.371">Let's</a>  go ahead and get started so that we can get finished. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=4.953">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=7.774">Thanks,</a>  Peter. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=8.734">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=10.435">OK,</a>  so please be advised. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=11.715">I'm</a>  going to read the posting and then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=13.476">Recording</a>  in progress. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=15.516">We've</a>  got a recording going here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=18.159">I'm</a>  gonna read the posting and then we can have some discussion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=22.382">Please</a>  be advised that on May 7th, 2024 at 6 p.m. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=25.063">there'll</a>  be an MSBA rules and onboarding subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via Zoom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=30.646">The</a>  meeting can be viewed live on the Medford Public Schools YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable, Comcast Channel 9, 8 or 22 and Verizon Channel 43, 45 or 47. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=39.771">The</a>  meeting will be recorded. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=43.553">Since</a>  the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log in by using the following link or call-in number. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=48.418">The</a>  meeting ID is 922-9520-7627. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=55.204">Questions</a>  and comments can be submitted to me during the meeting by emailing Jenny Graham at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=62.43">Those</a>  submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, and your question or comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=68.894">Okay,</a>  so I will do a quick roll call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=73.079">Member</a>  Ruseau. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=74.721">Present.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=78.345">Tracy</a>  Keene. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=79.187">Present.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=81.409">Aaron</a>  Olapade. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=82.17">Present.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=84.604">Emily</a>  Lazzaro, I don't see her. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=87.305">She</a>  probably has a conflict for this evening with the council. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=92.227">And</a>  Jenny Graham here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=93.567">So</a>  one, two, three, four present, one absent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=102.371">And</a>  we will get started. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=105.932">Now</a>  that all of that's out of the way, what I'm hoping we can do tonight is just come up with <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=114.233">some</a>  simple but effective operating rules for the committee, just so that we all can have a common grounding of how we're going to operate these meetings, because the team is very large. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=125.284">And</a>  talk specifically about public participation in our full team meetings, and consider whether we want to adopt the same public participation policies as we use at the school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=137.857">And</a>  then talk about any other onboarding activities that we want to bring to the group so that we can start to think about like, what those are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=145.681">So</a>  that's sort of the broad agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=148.282">It's</a>  a small group. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=149.523">There</a>  may be some people watching and it is being recorded. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=152.224">So</a>  people will be able to watch later, but I'm perfectly okay with us having. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=157.187">just</a>  a sort of conversation and coming to some consensus. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=160.889">At</a>  the end of the meeting, we'll take a vote on whatever it is that we have. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=163.69">And</a>  then we will bring that back to the main meeting next week for review, editing, et cetera, by the larger committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=170.753">Does</a>  that make sense?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=172.733">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=173.073">Questions?</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=174.774">Remember,</a>  Graham, I do have a document with a set of rules if we want to work from the document first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=183.338">I</a>  would love that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=185.234">Then</a>  I shall share. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=187.135">Let's</a>  see. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=193.176">Can</a>  you just confirm that you can't hear the video game console in my living room?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=197.577">We</a>  cannot hear any video games.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=199.517">Wonderful.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=200.878">These</a>  are just</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=211.882">My</a>  musings, so that's so I'm just going to go through them real quick. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=217.545">And</a>  then I think we can talk about them and talk about what's missing and obviously anybody's opinions on the things here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=223.507">So</a>  the 1st 1 is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=227.009">The</a>  full name of the committee, we will use the acronym SBC, which is actually what it looks like a lot of other places use in documentation and other written works. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=236.457">However,</a>  the first time SBC is used within any document, we'll actually write out the whole thing so that it doesn't become an acronym nightmare. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=244.143">But</a>  the intent here is that every single thing we write is not 14 pages long because it's such a long name. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=252.69">The</a>  SBC will operate following Robert's Rules of Order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=257.114">Members</a>  of the SBC are urged to, A, speak for themselves using I statements, allow for one speaker at a time, be present, engaged, and prepared, engage in open, honest conversations, assume best intentions, and understand, well, I fixed that sentence there, and understand, or, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=282.193">Acknowledge</a>  intent, hold themselves and 1 another accountable before public participation will be added to agendas on an as needed basis. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=291.438">This</a>  1. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=291.798">I</a>  just was like, I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=293.339">We</a>  want to add it to every agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=294.68">I</a>  don't know, but I just started there figuring we could work up to something else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=300.923">All</a>  meetings of the SBC or any subcommittees of the SBC shall operate in accordance with the open meeting law. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=306.61">The</a>  SBC shall, to the best of its ability, ensure that all meetings are recorded by Medford's Public Media and broadcast live to the district YouTube channel. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=319.205">Communications</a>  for the SBC will, and I know, I don't remember if this was in the application or where I have seen this language would be written at somewhere else, but it's like the chair speaks for the committee, or I don't remember what we had, but I was trying to find that language and I didn't wanna rewrite it from scratch. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=336.898">And</a>  then this one here, number seven, at our last meeting, our first meeting, all of the people who are members voting and non-voting <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=348.871">were</a>  called to see whether you were there, which everybody can agree makes sense. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=353.335">But</a>  when we were voting to adjourn, I realized that the commencement of a meeting when we take a roll call is actually doing dual duty. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=365.146">It</a>  is who's here, and it's actually a vote to begin the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=372.782">That's</a>  why I think that we still, non-voting members should be, are you here? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=377.525">But</a>  during the vote to adjourn, it is actually a very specific thing about ending the meeting only. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=383.028">And</a>  so I did talk to Jenny about, you know, should non-voting members be voting to adjourn? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=391.652">And</a>  after I started talking to her, I was just banging around on my head for a couple of days. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=395.614">And</a>  then I realized we definitely should not, I don't think, be voting to adjourn a meeting because <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=403.637">You</a>  need a majority of the folks to churn. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=407.198">Sorry,</a>  I live on the train tracks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=410.679">And</a>  I think that the end of the meeting, people are tired. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=414.2">And,</a>  you know, one of the things that has happened in open meeting law is that failures to properly adjourn a meeting, there's plenty of open meeting law violations around that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=425.102">and</a>  like host town councils, you know, the annual meetings, they have to come back together to vote to end the meetings, really dumb. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=432.926">So</a>  I just wanna make sure that the ending of the meeting is fully crystal clear. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=438.288">The</a>  only squishy thing here is that the beginning of the meeting, whoever's taking the role does have to have like a voting member, non-voting member, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=449.697">on</a>  the piece of paper or the document they're doing so that they can make sure there's a quorum of voting members to begin the meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=457.161">So</a>  it's very doable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=460.302">It's</a>  just a little more complicated than I think I'd imagined. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=464.164">So</a>  I don't have anything else other than this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=467.005">If</a>  there's stuff people think needs to be added or changed, let me know.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=478.884">Maybe</a>  one thing, I was just looking through our approved resolution to see if it was in there, that the placeholder that you have around communications being directed to the chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=493.195">And</a>  I did not find it there, so I don't, it must exist somewhere in the ether, but I think the answer there is, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=504.971">media</a>  requests for communication or comment regarding the SBC will be directed via me so that the committee knows that if they get a press request, that if the request is about speaking about what's happening on the committee, that that should come to me so that I can work with the right people to make sure that whatever we say is appropriate. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=535.242">I</a>  was also wondering whether I think public participation, I would personally like to see us adopt the same roles that we have for school committee around like <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=549.223">you</a>  can speak one time on a matter for up to three minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=553.166">So</a>  there's some specific language there in our rules document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=556.048">I</a>  don't know how you all feel about that in terms of like, you know, I don't think we're gonna see a lot of public participation in this like phase, but I think at some point we will, you know, when we're making like feasibility decisions. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=570.517">And</a>  I'm just curious, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=572.038">Like,</a>  can we sort of agree now what that looks like? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=576.601">And</a>  I'm just trying to pull up our rules document to grab.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=579.083">I</a>  already got it, John.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=581.484">Oh,</a>  you have it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=585.827">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=586.608">So</a>  I don't think that has to be the answer, but I think it is actually already documented. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=591.892">So</a>  we should work from it and say that that's sort of what we're proposing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=605.43">So</a>  public comment will be limited to three minutes per individual and will be limited to those matters on the agenda. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=611.193">That's</a>  important because when we don't do that, we sort of bump into open meeting law issues. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=616.175">The</a>  chair may limit comment to two minutes based on the number of individuals wishing to speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=621.31">The</a>  chair will announce the time limit prior to the public comment period at every meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=626.134">The</a>  public will also be encouraged to submit their comments in writing or by email or by emailing them to the superintendent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=633.34">I</a>  would maybe say the chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=636.903">Written</a>  comments will be forwarded to all members of the school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=649.892">Kim,</a>  I guess I'm wondering, do we set up an auto forward situation? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=655.156">And</a>  like, I believe that we'll have a general email box again. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=661.26">And</a>  what we can do is set up like an auto forward so that if something is coming into that box, it is being distributed to everybody.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=668.045">So</a>  I changed the chair to actually be the SPC email.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=678.513">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=682.105">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=703.712">And</a>  then I don't think we need that last sentence.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=707.293">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=711.585">Thoughts</a>  about that from a public participation perspective?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=714.267">Well,</a>  I like it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=721.492">I</a>  mean, I think I wrote that language before.</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=738.183">I</a>  think you want to take out email, I mean, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=741.821">or</a>  by mailing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=742.841">I</a>  mean, that seems like if you were sending it via post. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=749.024">Where</a>  am I looking at? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=750.444">The</a>  public will also be required for your cursors, writing either by email or by mailing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=756.047">Oh,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=759.388">I</a>  mean, because I guess I guess what the school can be to be a mailing address or how do you three get if someone wants to mail.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=771.265">I</a>  mean, I'm fine with just email. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=776.408">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=777.048">Email.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=777.309">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=779.33">Comments</a>  in writing by email to the SBC. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=782.892">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=785.573">I'll</a>  replace that with the name of the actual email address once we have one.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=788.915">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=790.456">And</a>  then I would just say via auto forwarding.</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=818.686">Am</a>  I muted? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=823.851">No,</a>  I'm not muted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=824.931">Can</a>  I go back to number three? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=828.434">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=829.795">And</a>  ask a non-elected official question.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=835.525">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=837.686">Since</a>  I have three elected officials, and Jenny, when you called, rolled, you say member, I noted at our meeting, we address superintendent, we address, obviously, out of decorum, Jenny as chair, mayor, what what is the proper <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=859.337">What</a>  should members of the SBC be urged to address fellow members of the committee?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=869.12">So</a>  I have thoughts on that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=872.621">And</a>  you know, well, Robert's Rules of Order does say that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=876.263">But</a>  one of the most common mistakes about understanding Robert's Rules of Order is that literally all of the rules can just be changed on the fly by the chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=889.333">There's</a>  a set of rules of which can be completely thrown out the window at the blink of an eye, which. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=895.298">Um,</a>  you know, if you haven't thrown them out the window, then we should be following them, but. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=899.442">You</a>  know, my, my personal opinions on this is that for subcommittees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=904.206">And,</a>  you know, I don't think we'll have committees at the whole kind of a thing for the this particular. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=908.53">For</a>  the school building committee, but, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=914.04">I</a>  personally prefer first names and just the collegiality that we'll have in a small group. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=921.924">I</a>  do think in a large group when there's no public present and we're not making a big decision, you know, we're working through documents and, you know, I just, I tend to prefer more collegial, you know, collegial is not the right word, but, you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=940.435">Informal.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=941.555">Informal.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=942.416">Thank</a>  you, Matt. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=943.457">But</a>  then, you know, we are being recorded and broadcast. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=947.6">So</a>  I'm very much open to always using, you know, the proper, you know, member, all the party member team, you know, I mean, we don't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=962.052">There's</a>  a lot of benefits to both, in my opinion, and it sometimes depends on who the folks are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=970.482">that</a>  you're actually, who is the rest of the committee? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=972.764">So,</a>  you know, like if we don't have any kind of significant personality conflicts in the school building committee, I'll just, I don't know how else to describe it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=983.872">Like</a>  everybody gets along with everybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=985.293">Nobody's</a>  interrupting anybody. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=987.755">You</a>  know, being less formal seems real easy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=992.618">If</a>  the chair has to wrangle the group, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=998.959">on</a>  a regular basis, then that becomes more, it becomes less, you know, you know, Paul, stop talking is much less, you know, doesn't sound great compared to, you know, remember or so your time is up or, and I feel like we don't know that stuff yet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1019.684">I'm</a>  all over the place, but that's just my thoughts.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1023.882">I</a>  personally like that I would propose that we write in here a rule that says we are residents and neighbors here in Medford. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1039.288">And</a>  as such, we will address each other on a first name basis, unless otherwise requested by a member of the committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1053.726">So</a>  if you want me to call you Mr. Rousseau, I'm happy to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1057.587">But</a>  I think my strong preference is people call me Jenny. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1064.408">We're</a>  all like friends and neighbors here trying to work hard to get something done. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1070.049">I</a>  just want people to feel like they're part of a team instead of part of a body of elected people. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1077.45">Because</a>  we're not, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1078.351">We're</a>  appointed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1082.355">So</a>  I don't know, that seems like maybe it'll work till it doesn't. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1089.847">But</a>  I don't know what you guys think of that.</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1096.701">I</a>  mean, it works for me because it also then while we there is hierarchy in the committee, because obviously we have a chair, but it's for me, as you were just saying, where we're not elected, where have been appointed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1116.687">And</a>  I like the idea of trying to find trust amongst the committee seems to be on a more informal basis than a formality. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1129.411">Yeah,</a>  that's just my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1131.191">I'm</a>  sorry, Tracy. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1134.432">I</a>  hate to ask you to repeat that the train was going by and I disconnected.</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1140.802">I</a>  was supporting what Jenny was saying, meaning that while we're not elected official and we are appointed, it seems like in order to establish a level of trust and the get-go, while there is hierarchy as we do have a chair, and there is obviously non-voting members on the committee, it seems to me, and I love the way Jenny started out, we are residents and neighbors, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1169.791">working</a>  on behalf of the committee to do this, this hard work.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1177.235">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1178.435">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1179.036">Aaron,</a>  how do you feel about that?</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1182.337">I</a>  also agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1182.998">I</a>  think that there's going to be, it is a long process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1185.899">And</a>  I think that the more that we, I think feels equals as much as possible that allows for a certain sense of like, um, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1192.642">I</a>  think community strength that I think I prefer, just because I think having certain titles for people is understandable, and we want to show a certain amount of respect, but I also think that we want to operate as if we're one body, and not where there's a hierarchy where certain people's voices or votes are going to have far more influence than others. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1212.586">for</a>  the most part, so I also agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1214.187">I</a>  think it's better to try to be as impartial in our communication as possible while also being respectful to people's titles and things like that.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1222.652">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1225.473">Sounds</a>  great. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1226.033">I</a>  did, well, I think it was while Tracy was speaking, I realized there might be two exceptions I just wrote in there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1231.456">I</a>  don't know what you all think on that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1234.298">Yeah,</a>  I think that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1235.619">And</a>  if they don't like that, they can tell us.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1237.98">That's</a>  correct, right.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1239.22">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1243.188">Tracy,</a>  the other question I had for you is, I'm going to make an assumption that you don't know what Robert's rules of order are. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1251.415">Maybe</a>  you do. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1253.937">But</a>  I think what would be helpful here is to, I don't know, what are the most important rules <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1265.929">can</a>  we write them down so that people aren't like, where do I even find what that means to be able to agree to it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1273.635">So</a>  I mean, I think in my mind, giving them a cheat sheet is good. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1282.562">But</a>  even in words, to me, one rule is that voting happens. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1294.477">on</a>  the committee when there is a motion to do something and a second and possibly debate on that subject. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1315.43">And</a>  I think we maybe don't need to get into if there's too many motions on the floor, you got to stop and dispatch of things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1322.752">I</a>  don't think we need to go there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1326.914">But</a>  I think saying when we have to take a vote, somebody makes a motion, somebody makes a second, we have conversation, and then we vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1339.598">And</a>  under the open meeting law, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1343.634">Voice</a>  votes are allowed, which means when everybody is in person. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1351.002">So</a>  we can just say all those in favor, aye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1353.345">All</a>  those opposed, no. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1356.528">And</a>  as long as there's no question, that's fine. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1362.355">But</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1364.258">at</a>  any time, any member can simply request a roll call vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1369.241">Like,</a>  I think that's an important structure for people to understand. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1371.823">Like,</a>  we're going to not call 25 people, like a 25 person roll every single time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1379.487">But</a>  if somebody feels strongly that they need to know where people stand, that that's a possibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1390.541">I</a>  think the other thing about voting that I sort of am wondering about is like, do we call only voting members in the role? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1402.667">Or</a>  are we trying to like also record the sort of opinion of non-voting members?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1410.911">It's</a>  a great question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1412.032">You</a>  know, as a non-voting member, I actually <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1418.892">I</a>  don't personally feel like I need to make my vote known how I would vote if I had been a voting member. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1426.763">I</a>  think the reason I don't feel that way is that <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1431.028">when</a>  there is, as in the item just above it, when there's debate, I mean, it's pretty uncommon that people are going to be speaking on a topic and nobody knows how they actually were gonna vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1441.871">And</a>  that's, in my mind, the role of the non-voting members is like, if I'm gonna have any influence, it's going to be in what I have to say so that the voting members may choose to vote a different way or vote the way I want. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1456.375">So</a>  I don't, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1458.327">really</a>  feel the need for us to record all the non-voting members' opinions? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1465.972">When</a>  we go to the full committee, there can be a different opinion.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1472.677">I</a>  think maybe another thing about motions that would be important to say is any member may suggest an amendment to a motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1485.257">And</a>  maybe we just say, and the chair will guide the group through the proper way to accept or reject that amendment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1502.206">So</a>  that I don't need you all to know how to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1506.348">But</a>  if that happens, I will handle it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1509.169">And</a>  we will work through it and go from there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1520.436">I'm</a>  just like looking through my trustee Roberts rules board a book here see what else we're missing.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1526.358">Well,</a>  I'm very how long it is you're missing a lot but that's because it's ridiculous.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1532.007">Yeah,</a>  well, one other thing that I was just reading about is there are typically limits to how often you can speak. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1543.816">So</a>  Robert's rule says you can speak twice on a topic for, oh, where'd it go? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1554.064">Hold</a>  on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1556.606">You</a>  may speak and debate twice on any debatable motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1561.673">on</a>  the same day, each time you may speak for up to 10 minutes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1565.434">That</a>  is what Robert's Rules of Order says. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1570.776">I</a>  would propose that we amend that to be commiserate with what we're allowing the public to do in an event that things are out of hand, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1586.904">just</a>  so that people understand that once we get to the point where we'll have discussion, and that's one thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1594.428">Once</a>  we get to the point where we're going to take a motion and vote, there is sometimes diminishing return on everybody talking exhaustively why they think the way they think, when really we just need to take the vote and let the vote go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1614.211">Obviously,</a>  that becomes a problem when things are contentious, but maybe that's a good place to start.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1627.631">I</a>  put this one in here, Jenny G. It's actually something we frequently have even in school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1634.175">And</a>  to me, it's always new members that are confused by this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1639.278">But</a>  once the voting has begun, there is no motions allowed, no amendments, no conversation of any sort. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1651.816">You</a>  can vote no, and then talk about it or make a different motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1655.738">But</a>  it's just a constant problem, even with a small group of seven. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1659.6">So</a>  I do worry about a large group being like, I got one more thing after we started to take the roll.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1673.163">The</a>  other thing that Robert's Rules of Order talks a lot about is how to reconsider something if you feel like the group has made a mistake. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1683.07">And</a>  again, do we maybe just put something in there, like if a member of the committee believes a mistake was made and would like to discuss a completed motion further, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1700.865">They</a>  simply need to alert the chair and the chair will like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1706.07">Assist</a>  through that process, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1711.756">Yeah,</a>  no, I agree, except I do think it's important to include the most important caveat. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1717.382">There</a>  is the only members that may actually do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1719.765">Our</a>  vote those that voted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1722.33">for</a>  the thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1724.551">No,</a>  in the winning thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1725.952">So</a>  if a motion was on the floor and it passes, the only members that may, in fact, redo this are those that voted for it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1735.017">If</a>  it fails, the only members that may do that are the members that voted for it against it.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1740.881">OK,</a>  that's a fair and important point. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1743.783">Because</a>  otherwise, you're just going to recycle. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1746.304">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1755.65">Um,</a>  do we have any, um, like when it comes to like meeting, meeting minutes and like accurate minutes being taken, you know, these are all going to be recorded and we'd understand that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1768.284">But</a>  have we decided if we're going to, like how we're going to go about having them running down, like who's going to be doing that?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1778.857">I</a>  think we are required to publish and approve minutes for every meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1783.8">And</a>  I think there is still some conversation happening about who will be responsible for that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1794.668">So</a>  that is something I need to get with the superintendent on to make sure that we have an answer to that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1816.784">I</a>  think the other thing that we might want to mention is like, if we're going to take the agenda out of order, that we need to make an official motion to suspend the rules and take the agenda out of order. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1828.652">And</a>  that's really because that's a choice that we're making that <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1836.398">impacts</a>  like how the public can participate in that conversation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1839.481">So</a>  if you were wait, if you knew that it was like the last agenda item, and we took it first, like you may miss it completely and not be able to talk about the things that you wanted to talk about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1852.315">And</a>  so I think when it comes to making sure that we're appropriately hearing from the public, we want to make sure that we're <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1861.523">We</a>  just want to make sure that we are not doing that haphazardly. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1866.384">Let's</a>  put it that way. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1885.829">I've</a>  reached the end of my Roberts Rules of Order book. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1891.64">I</a>  feel like if we can work through these, we're probably going to be OK most of the time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1899.044">Do</a>  you agree with that, Paul?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1903.587">I</a>  do agree with that, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1904.927">And</a>  as I say one too many times, these are living documents. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1909.37">We</a>  literally can change them on the fly in our meeting with a majority vote. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1913.953">So</a>  perfect is not a thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1919.721">And</a>  I'm just going to say that.</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1924.349">Can</a>  I ask a question of the three of you? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1927.275">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1927.836">Often</a>  in my role as chair of nonprofit organizations, I <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1932.993">have</a>  the secretary put a lot of the items that are non-controversial on a consent agenda, and we vote the consent agenda all at once. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1943.022">Is</a>  that something that typically happens in school committee or open meeting laws, et cetera? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1951.53">As</a>  you were talking about agenda and voting, that just popped in my head, Jenny.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1957.015">Yes,</a>  we do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1960.173">We</a>  do that with certain items, usually like the minutes and things like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=1968.718">So</a>  maybe we need to just say something like, the chair will create an agenda and may elect to use a consent agenda to approve non-controversial items in an effort to ensure the meeting moves along. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2016.113">I'm</a>  thinking that we should move that number number five that we should move that up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2022.839">And</a>  maybe number six because those are like if you only take a couple things away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2031.167">Those</a>  are good things to take away and maybe put them right after number two. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2067.568">Okay,</a>  what else are we missing? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2075.117">It's</a>  more than one page, but still seems pretty brief.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2080.504">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2084.589">The</a>  school committee rules can be bound in a book.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2094.143">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2095.204">Anything</a>  else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2095.964">We</a>  can come back if there is something else that we forget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2100.366">The</a>  other topic for us to talk about that we haven't talked about yet is like, if we are thinking about the committee, what kind of onboarding activities and information do we want to make sure the committee has at their disposal? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2121.187">We</a>  talked to, you know, the three things I put on the agenda are tours, exemplar documents, and any additional training that people feel like they need, and anything else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2133.716">So</a>  those are some questions that I had more to think through. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2139.961">I</a>  have had, like, less of an answer about that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2146.341">that's</a>  something that is maybe worth talking about as a group here as well.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2156.967">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I thought about this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2161.15">And</a>  one of the things that I struggle with a bit is, well, first of all, we're sort of onboarding as we go right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2176.648">Everybody</a>  is a current member. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2179.69">And</a>  so, you know, we might be able to just like, I'm sure we have a list of things we could say we should have on that list. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2186.853">But</a>  it feels more like it should be just a living document as we like, somebody as we are doing meetings, and we're like, you know, somebody new, if somebody was just thinking and paying attention to like, a new person coming in today, without this information, they're coming in in a month, I should say, without this information, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2207.718">Yeah,</a>  they really need it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2209.4">So</a>  there's the onboarding of, like, this is our set of rules that we just approved. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2214.305">This</a>  is, you know, this is the chair. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2216.527">This</a>  is the superintendent. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2217.669">Here's</a>  everybody's names. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2218.97">Here's</a>  our email addresses. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2221.773">Those</a>  things are basic things for a checklist, which I think we should draft, of course. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2228.56">But</a>  then. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2230.585">thinking</a>  about making sure that they're effective, and then they could be coming in in year four of this project for Grand Out Loud. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2237.751">It</a>  makes me feel like that needs to be a living document. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2239.972">When</a>  we finish all of eligibility, and somebody starts two months into the next phase, we may wanna like flush things off that list rather than saying, here's your 7,000 pages to read now that you're a new member. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2255.545">That's</a>  just my thoughts.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2267.281">And</a>  are you thinking that we would put that checklist right in here? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2270.503">Or</a>  are you thinking like we're going to assign somebody to do that and bring it back?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2275.587">I</a>  would rather just refer to it from here and have it be someplace else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2286.013">Because</a>  I mean, who would maintain it? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2293.583">I</a>  mean, we certainly can start one now and have a list of, you know, the things that are going to stay the same throughout the entire process. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2306.194">Payroll,</a>  you know, like the kind of thing you did if you were joining a company, then you sit at your new desk and you have no idea what ends up, even though you've got your account now.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2324.524">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2335.188">I</a>  guess me, I guess the chair, right?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2338.87">Yeah,</a>  I mean, but but committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2341.471">Oh,</a>  I like that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2341.851">And</a>  then we can, you know, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2355.682">meet</a>  as needed when we realize, hey, you know, this is no longer what the current list looks like.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2365.336">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2366.218">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2376.115">Well,</a>  it seemed like one of the first things we need to do is what we did last week is have an onboarding of open meeting laws.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2387.1">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2388.94">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2394.023">Can</a>  you see my?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2395.563">Yeah,</a>  we can.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2398.14">Never</a>  know when I do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2399.861">So</a>  we have OML. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2401.842">We</a>  have Roberts. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2403.403">Well,</a>  I'm just going to say the SBC rules.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2409.806">Issue</a>  an email address.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2412.427">SBA</a>  process overview. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2418.351">Issue</a>  email address. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2421.672">Add</a>  to distribution list.</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2431.538">Jenny,</a>  you know, going back to MSBA process overview, the posting that you shared on Facebook or wherever you laid it out, where we are, it seems a good history lesson of how we got to this point now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2449.726">And</a>  that might be part of that overview.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2453.327">Yes,</a>  agree. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2456.361">And</a>  the other thing, at some point soon, we'll have a website where all of this stuff can live. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2461.905">So</a>  it really could be just a matter of somebody from this team sitting and onboarding somebody and walking them through those steps, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2470.292">Once</a>  it's all there, it gets pretty easy to be able to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2475.936">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2476.136">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2485.356">Well,</a>  I don't know about a press release every time we add a new member. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2502.54">I</a>  mean, hopefully that doesn't happen often, but I do think.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2505.921">Yeah,</a>  I don't think we really want to do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2507.501">There</a>  might be some like big changes, but.</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2514.582">One</a>  of the things that part of my onboarding for staff at my job, I work at Harvard, and Harvard is known for acronyms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2524.826">And</a>  I wonder, in school committee world, are there acronyms that we need to make sure that everyone knows about or understands or an acronym cheat sheet or something like that, so when people are using short term <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2544.968">in</a>  reference and people know what they're actually talking about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2551.05">Yep,</a>  absolutely.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2570.438">You</a>  know, and I think that <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2572.982">Thinking</a>  about coming from this meeting and going to the full membership, you know, I think, you know, my preference is that we actually, like, this is what we send them. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2584.167">And</a>  then that the checklist isn't, like, they don't approve the checklist. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2588.148">We</a>  want their feedback if they have ideas for more things, but it should just be such a living document that just changes on the fly as anybody and everybody thinks, oh, well, what about that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2599.593">Rather</a>  than it being a policy that we have to, like, vote on. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2603.36">Yeah,</a>  I agree with that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2605.0">So,</a>  um, so I can, I can certainly also. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2608.201">You</a>  know, if we're not going to vote on this, I'm not going to vote obviously, but, like, if this is not something we're sending to them for approval, then I can work on this list and making it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2618.863">Look</a>  like something useful offline. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2625.644">But</a>  I don't know if we have anything else to add to this thing.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2634.565">I</a>  don't think so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2635.686">I</a>  can't think of anything else. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2638.589">What</a>  do you all think? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2641.351">I</a>  like the brevity, personally. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2645.215">It's</a>  not too much to wrap your head around.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2653.943">Should</a>  we take the chair may limit to two minutes? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2657.779">Oh,</a>  this is the public comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2658.76">We</a>  want to keep that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2659.3">Yeah,</a>  yeah, that's the public comment.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2660.741">It's</a>  not the members thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2663.143">It's</a>  down below. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2663.924">OK,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2667.006">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2667.306">You</a>  scrolled up. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2668.648">Oh,</a>  well, up, down, whatever it is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2670.829">It's</a>  number 5C, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2674.832">No,</a>  F. Is that what you're talking about?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2679.036">Oh,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2679.356">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2679.696">Yes,</a>  that was it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2680.477">I</a>  just, right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2681.718">That's</a>  fine.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2686.702">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2688.32">It's</a>  like, we've got something good here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2689.801">I</a>  will, you know, even though I assume that we all will make a vote emotion and vote for this. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2695.246">I</a>  will go through real quick and just. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2697.267">Even</a>  after the meeting and just make sure we don't have any typos or anything.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2701.631">Okay,</a>  just a quick question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2705.334">Do</a>  we do we have any thoughts about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2712.332">exemplar</a>  documents or districts that we think people should pay attention to? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2718.496">And</a>  I think that's a question we can ask the whole group, but I don't want the list to be so big and so long that it's like, I don't have time to sort of go through and find all those documents for all those folks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2730.583">But</a>  it might make some sense for us to make <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2734.965">connections</a>  with like Arlington, for example. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2738.466">They're</a>  like in the thick of their program. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2740.726">So,</a>  you know, maybe even like Arlington, Somerville, Stoneham, Winchester. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2750.229">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2751.169">It's</a>  been pretty, has done a pretty good job, I think, at keeping their like website, for example, really up to date, I think really detailed.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2759.071">Is</a>  that Stoneham you said?</p>

    <p>[Aaron Olapade]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2760.571">Belmont.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2761.632">Belmont.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2762.192">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2763.072">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2766.747">One</a>  more time, sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2768.067">Stoneham.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2770.128">Arlington.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2771.549">Arlington.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2773.669">Somerville.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2777.691">It's</a>  very interesting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2778.631">As</a>  I looked around, I have very little time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2780.272">Winchester.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2781.252">Winchester.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2783.493">And</a>  I think the appeal of Winchester, they've been done for a bit, but they <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2792.496">started,</a>  I think, with something that looked like Medford High. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2795.817">So</a>  sort of interesting.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2799.597">I</a>  think it looked better before.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2802.738">But</a>  they renovated in place, I guess, as it were. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2806.198">Yes,</a>  yes, they did. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2810.299">I</a>  think the other question is, is there a Volk district that is succeeding? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2821.952">So</a>  let's talk about the places that are having some trouble right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2826.195">But</a>  is there a VOC district in the area that is sort of succeeding through the process that might be interesting?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2835.9">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2836.821">I</a>  mean, there was.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2838.522">Maybe</a>  we just write vocational question, and we can open that up to conversation.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2848.287">Mohawk,</a>  did they do one? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2852.318">That's</a>  not it.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2858.08">I</a>  mean. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2859.801">Members</a>  of the committee may have some other ideas, but it would be nice for us to like. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2865.063">Go</a>  off and you know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2867.684">Identify</a>  who these districts are and sort of. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2872.946">Accumulate</a>  some links to like their relevant documents and that kind of thing. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2876.528">Right?</a> </p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2876.788">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2880.492">When</a>  you list any vocational schools, are there any other schools like Curtis Tufts that has integrated there into a high school? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2895.746">Somerville.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2897.067">Somerville</a>  did, okay.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2898.509">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2900.343">Yeah,</a>  my subcommittee on that will be reviewing that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2905.406">I</a>  forget. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2906.566">Is</a>  it next week, maybe, the week after? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2909.167">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2911.028">Because</a>  they did do that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2912.509">And</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2917.091">I</a>  have too many meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2918.072">I</a>  can't find it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2918.732">Not</a>  tomorrow, I hope.</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2920.133">No.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2923.294">So</a>  this is also a question as a non-school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2929.634">not</a>  necessarily on-boarding but I guess as you list these exemplar school committee building committees are there other areas in the school committee psyche that non people that are you know are there are there places to go in terms of reading making sure you're <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2953.348">following</a>  them on Facebook or something like that to be in the know of what's happening across the district or in Massachusetts in terms of school committee related issues that pertain to buildings?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2969.676">So</a>  MSBA has a Facebook page. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2974.999">So</a>  we could list that, and we could also <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2982.44">sort</a>  of send reminders when there are scheduled board meetings, regardless of whether we're up or not, because the public can listen in on those meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=2996.464">And,</a>  you know, the other thing, is the MASC listserv like sort of open to the public, or do you have to be a school committee person for that?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3007.326">You</a>  have to be a school committee patent member. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3010.935">I</a>  do wish they were a little stricter once you weren't a school committee member, but that's.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3017.098">Had</a>  some former school committee members wreaking havoc, but yeah okay. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3023.142">I</a>  think those would be like the two big things and then certainly like if there's something that seems relevant, we can share.</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3031.853">And</a>  speaking of school committee, Jenny, you will let this committee know, A, obviously, if something is coming before the school committee. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3041.241">But</a>  are there times when you think it'll be worthwhile that some members or all the committee is present or has some showing at a school committee meeting?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3054.131">Maybe.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3056.733">So</a>  we'll <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3061.722">Sort</a>  of do our best to let, you know, when there's topics that are relevant, like, there's 1, you know, I think on the 20th, we'll have a meeting where we'll be talking about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3072.177">The</a>  school committee will be talking about potential expansion of vocational programming. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3077.69">And</a>  that might be of interest for people to listen in on, albeit not required for you to be there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3085.035">But</a>  I think there probably are some big gate style meetings that folks who are able to join would be helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3095.481">So</a>  I can certainly let people know that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3101.531">as</a>  it happens. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3103.155">But</a>  I would say attendance is not mandatory to those things. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3144.587">What</a>  else? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3156.85">Are</a>  we done an hour in advance?</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3159.231">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3159.951">Going</a>  back to the onboarding, should we make any reference to cadence of meetings?</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3167.956">Or</a>  or how often giving people the meeting schedule that would probably be really helpful. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3172.192">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3182.004">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3182.764">I</a>  mean, the actual act of deciding, I mean, of selecting an additional member is not going to be in here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3190.729">And</a>  I think it's also not going to be, there's not going to be one path. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3197.252">I</a>  don't know if Jenny spoke about it in our last meeting.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3202.375">I</a>  believe that is all left to the chair via the resolution.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3208.158">Right.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3209.939">So,</a>  you know, like if we lose, <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3212.953">you</a>  know, some kind of specific kind of engineer and we have another specific, that same kind of engineer in the queue of people who applied, then, you know, the chair will probably want to replace them with that person. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3225.585">So</a>  it's, it's hard to formulate, be formulaic about that stuff. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3232.252">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3232.893">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3233.855">I</a>  mean, obviously that, you know, when the chair's asking somebody if they want to take a seat, you know, the meeting schedule will be important so that they can see the meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3244.761">But</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3247.082">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3258.095">So</a>  I'm not a voting member, but I'll just, I mean, actually there's two school committee members here. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3263.798">I</a>  don't have to tell you all how to make a motion.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3267.579">So</a>  is there a motion to approve these rules and onboarding checklist to the SPC?</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3282.486">So</a>  moved.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3284.907">And</a>  is there a second? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3287.689">Seconded</a>  by member Olapade. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3291.431">So</a>  roll call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3295.033">Member</a>  Olapade? <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3295.633">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3299.055">Sorry,</a>  Aaron, oh my, Tracy Keene.</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3305.48">It's</a>  gonna be a hard habit to break, Jenny.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3307.342">I</a>  know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3309.563">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3310.804">And</a>  Jenny and myself, Jenny Graham, yes. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3313.106">So</a>  three in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3316.208">We</a>  will report this out to the full committee next week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3320.351">Is</a>  there a motion to adjourn?</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3323.053">So</a>  moved.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3326.547">Motion</a>  to adjourn by Tracy Keene, seconded by?</p>

    <p>[Tracy Keene]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/sc-subcommittee-05-07-24&start=3329.89">Second.</a> </p>
