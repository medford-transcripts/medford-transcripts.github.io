1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:09,387
and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

2
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:14,771
Approval of the minutes of the October 16, 2017 meeting.

3
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:18,635
Motion for approval by Mrs. Van de Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

4
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:19,695
All those in favor?

5
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:20,396
Aye.

6
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:21,137
All those opposed?

7
00:00:21,697 --> 00:00:22,378
Motion passes.

8
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:24,980
Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,761
Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry.

10
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:27,602
Mr. Benedetto.

11
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:28,362
Thank you.

12
00:00:32,077 --> 00:00:34,399
Yes, these are your student activity accounts.

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,902
These are all student activities.

14
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:03,018
Yes, anything with the first three digits of 890 is your student activity accounts.

15
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:46,389
That's a revolving account, so that is within one of the production areas.

16
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,855
The production areas for revolving accounts, it's not the general fund, so it'd be one of the ancillary accounts.

17
00:01:55,275 --> 00:02:00,237
And then my last question is on page 28 of 36.

18
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:07,900
It says the vendor name is Secret 21, and it's $200 in the account for the school.

19
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:13,682
I'm sorry, could you repeat the?

20
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:15,183
Yeah, page 28 of 36.

21
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:20,045
It's the eighth line item down.

22
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:23,958
Oh, Teachers 21?

23
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:34,688
Yes, that's a contract that we have for service provided through an internet provision for professional development and instruction.

24
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:46,495
Again, that's through a grant, so the grant descriptions are not as extensive.

25
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:47,356
OK.

26
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:52,379
There's a motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

27
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,300
All those in favor?

28
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,380
Aye.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,741
All those opposed?

30
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:55,601
Motion passes.

31
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,363
Approval of payrolls.

32
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:00,625
Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

33
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:00,985
Kretz.

34
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:02,286
All those in favor?

35
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:02,366
Aye.

36
00:03:03,027 --> 00:03:03,687
All those opposed?

37
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:04,428
Motion passes.

38
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:05,788
Report of secretary.

39
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:07,350
None.

40
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,111
Report of committees.

41
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:10,632
None.

42
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:16,828
I just wanted to share a note.

43
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:16,888
Ms.

44
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:17,088
Fritz.

45
00:03:17,548 --> 00:03:17,748
Yes.

46
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:22,189
I stopped by the library a couple weeks ago, and I have some cool news.

47
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:28,270
So I'm not sure if everybody's seen it, but at the library, there's a new electronic sign-in iPad.

48
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:36,911
And so far, what the students do is they can sign in, and they can track how many students are in the library throughout the day.

49
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:41,952
And it electronically goes into a data, like a Google spreadsheet,

50
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:53,687
And they can quickly run reports and send it to the headmaster, principals, and they can give the total number of students that are in the library at any point in time.

51
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:57,510
And it's just a great resource.

52
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,093
And I just wanted to share that news with everybody.

53
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:02,154
Thank you very much, Ms.

54
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:02,634
Gretz.

55
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:03,815
Ms.

56
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:05,316
Mustone, motion for suspension?

57
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:05,476
Oh, yeah.

58
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:09,119
Could I make a motion to suspend the rules to hear the report out of order of project 351?

59
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:13,420
This motion on the floor for suspension of rules, all seconded by Ms.

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,880
Van de Kloot.

61
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,621
All those in favor?

62
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:15,801
All those opposed?

63
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:16,842
Suspension is granted.

64
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:18,143
Report on project 351.

65
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:20,164
Mr. Superintendent?

66
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:36,134
Mayor and members of the school committee, as you know, project 351 was started by Governor Patrick.

67
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:39,456
It was an attempt to provide leaders who

68
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:44,426
come from our middle schools, and they would do community service.

69
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:52,848
Now, we've done this for a number of years, and this evening, we have two representatives, one from the McGlynn and one from the Andrews.

70
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:58,409
And right now, we'll call upon our principal, Paul DeLeva, to introduce the person from the Andrews.

71
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,510
Would you like to step up here so you can go?

72
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,750
Yes, OK.

73
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:04,771
Come on up.

74
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:04,931
Ms.

75
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:05,331
Heineck.

76
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,732
This is really nice.

77
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:15,829
Either one.

78
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:16,710
Either one is fine.

79
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,571
So, good evening members of the school committee.

80
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:24,233
As you know, every year we participate in Project 351.

81
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:37,418
It's a great project that has been done with the Andrews and the McGlynn, having representatives to develop leaders as well as come up with community service projects for our school individually.

82
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:42,600
As you know, they meet on Mata Lutha King Day as a big group.

83
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:48,831
And they develop their projects through discussions with everybody, through the school.

84
00:05:49,831 --> 00:05:57,975
I'd like to welcome Ava Heinegg, who is the daughter of Max Heinegg, who is also a school teacher at the Medford High School.

85
00:05:58,015 --> 00:06:05,078
And Mr. Heinegg and I share a little bit of camaraderie, because we were both at the Brooks Hobs at one point together on the same team.

86
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:08,620
So it comes to full circle that his daughter

87
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,418
is being represented for Project 351.

88
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:14,059
So I'd like to introduce Ava Heinegg.

89
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,322
Hi.

90
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:29,665
OK, so I would like to start by saying what an honor it is to represent the Andrews Middle School.

91
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:38,508
This is a vital opportunity for me, and I'm so thankful to be given a chance to be part of something that could be so beneficial to our community.

92
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:45,833
To meet other kids and be able to converse and share ideas that could impact people in need is such an amazing thing.

93
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:51,878
I'm so proud to represent Medford because it has been such a large part of my life.

94
00:06:52,458 --> 00:07:07,850
Doing town soccer, volunteering at the library and farmer's market, attending public school here, and dancing at a local studio, O'Cheryl A. Sullivan's, and even doing school plays and Builders Club, that's a community service club,

95
00:07:08,402 --> 00:07:09,883
at the Andrews.

96
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:17,249
And so I would like to thank you for the opportunity to be a part of Project 351.

97
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,751
Thank you.

98
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:33,603
I also want to mention she's joined by her mom, Wendy, and her sister, Stella, who are here.

99
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:35,625
And Wendy's a teacher as well.

100
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:42,863
Any questions?

101
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:45,184
Miss Cuneo.

102
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:47,805
First of all, congratulations, Eva.

103
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:48,946
Thank you.

104
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:56,628
I actually participated in that a few years back, and it was just an amazing, amazing day.

105
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:08,713
If you're not involved with it, unfortunately, and we didn't know about it, but I had the opportunity to go down and to see students from all over the state really working together, and what a camaraderie.

106
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:20,403
for students that really didn't know each other at the beginning of the day to really become very friendly by the end of the day and they were all working really for the cause of a larger community.

107
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:30,152
So I mean it's just amazing and I want to thank you and I also want to thank the other student for representing Medford so well but I have a question for you and that is what is it that you did?

108
00:08:31,574 --> 00:08:32,174
That I did?

109
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:32,735
That day.

110
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:34,563
But she hasn't.

111
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:35,504
I haven't gone yet.

112
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:36,505
Oh, you haven't gone yet?

113
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:36,605
No.

114
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,306
She hasn't gone yet.

115
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:39,267
What did I think about the Luther King Day?

116
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:40,428
Oh, that's right.

117
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:40,949
I am sorry.

118
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:42,630
So come back and let us know what you did.

119
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,251
I will.

120
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:44,912
But congratulations.

121
00:08:44,972 --> 00:08:45,453
Thank you.

122
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:47,734
For some reason, I thought everyone went by.

123
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:49,676
Congratulations.

124
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:50,056
Thank you.

125
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:06,795
We also want to announce that Sumaya Omi, I don't know if she's present this evening, she's not here from the McGlynn Middle School.

126
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:11,758
We send her our regards as well and we hope to see her after Martin Luther King Day as well.

127
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:26,712
Motion on the floor to revert to the regular business by Miss Quinn must own all those in favor.

128
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:28,354
All those opposed.

129
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:30,796
Motion to accept the report in place on file.

130
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:31,897
All those in favor.

131
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:33,719
All those opposed.

132
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,440
Motion passes.

133
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:36,942
Community participation.

134
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:39,344
Melanie McLaughlin CPAC update.

135
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:41,546
Mr Benedetto.

136
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:45,656
I got an email from Melanie right before our meeting.

137
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:50,398
She's homesick, and she would have to cancel for this evening and postpone.

138
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:53,660
Is there a motion to table her request for participation?

139
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:53,800
Second.

140
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:55,081
On the motion.

141
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:55,801
All those in favor?

142
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:56,322
Aye.

143
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:57,182
All those opposed?

144
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:57,963
Motion passes.

145
00:09:59,323 --> 00:09:59,944
Miss Mustone.

146
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:07,128
I am aware that the McGlynn School has requested to be part of the community participation program, but it's not listed.

147
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:10,730
So I was wondering if that's something that we could get from.

148
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,776
Is there someone from the McGlynn that wanted to come up and speak?

149
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:14,856
Yes.

150
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:20,477
Good evening.

151
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:21,018
Good evening.

152
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:25,379
Thank you.

153
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:31,460
Shalene Douglas, president of the Memphis Teacher Association, 414 High Street, Memphis, Massachusetts.

154
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:37,462
First of all, I'm having candy because I had garlic at dinner.

155
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:38,575
Thank you.

156
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:44,919
We appreciate having the meeting with you and the superintendent to discuss the middle school action plan.

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,463
Roy, I did receive your email today with a date of December 6th for us to move forward on this.

158
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:55,445
I will poll the teachers to see if this date works.

159
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,986
And if it does work, we will have that meeting.

160
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:06,131
We assume that you and the school committee members will meet us at the McGlynn Middle School on that day if it's approved.

161
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:19,214
I also, as promised to Mr. Belson, have the binders illustrating our concerns regarding the original plan, and I would like to share those with you tonight.

162
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:28,243
So I'd like to ask Ryan McCarthy and Brian Villard to give those to you now, so you'll have time to look those over prior to our meeting on the 6th.

163
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:43,303
They're color-coded.

164
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:44,163
Very teacher.

165
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:46,685
Very teacher oriented.

166
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:57,894
Thank you.

167
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:00,096
Thank you.

168
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:03,098
And one to Mr. Belson and one to the mayor.

169
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:03,559
No, no, no.

170
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:04,059
We have none?

171
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,121
I can read it.

172
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:06,421
Thank you.

173
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:07,362
Did Mr. Belson get one?

174
00:12:07,402 --> 00:12:07,722
Great.

175
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:08,423
OK, we're all set.

176
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:08,963
Thank you.

177
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:09,163
No.

178
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:09,664
Thank you.

179
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:10,084
He doesn't.

180
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:10,224
No.

181
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:11,405
I don't know.

182
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:13,387
I don't think so.

183
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:14,348
It's up to you.

184
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:15,488
I don't think he needs it though.

185
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:17,889
Okay.

186
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:18,850
All right.

187
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,051
So lastly, our members are here tonight to show support for the grievances.

188
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:24,132
You were here late tonight.

189
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:30,935
So I'm going to ask all those teachers here to support the grievances to please stand.

190
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:38,158
And I want to thank you for your solidarity.

191
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:41,341
and to let you know these people are here in support of these grievances.

192
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,623
And I thank you for your time.

193
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:58,392
Report of Superintendent.

194
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,734
Recommendation to appoint Dr. Patrick Sabia as School Physician.

195
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:02,574
Mr. Superintendent.

196
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:08,038
Mayor and members of the School Committee, I'm going to call upon Tony Vento, our Health Supervisor, to introduce Dr. Patrick Sabia.

197
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,241
Dr. Kristen Goodell has taken a position at Boston University.

198
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:16,343
as a dean, and she's done a great job for us.

199
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:19,145
And Dr. Sabia is going to do a great job for us.

200
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:21,846
We met the other day, and we're really excited to have him on board.

201
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:27,070
But I'm going to let Tony introduce him and let Dr. Sabia make a few remarks and answer any questions you may have.

202
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:29,451
Good evening.

203
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:33,814
I'd like to introduce Dr. Patrick Sabia as our new school physician.

204
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:37,537
He practices in Medford with Medford Family Care.

205
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:41,599
He's had over 25 years of practice.

206
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:51,219
in many community health centers, including Cambridge Health Alliance and the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center, and also out at Metro West Medical Center.

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,704
He's on the Tufts faculty, teaching family medicine residents.

208
00:13:57,485 --> 00:14:03,850
He's been a member of different quality improvement committees while at Cambridge Health Alliance and was director of

209
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:05,237
obstetrics.

210
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:15,622
So we're very excited to have him follow the good steps of Dr. Goodell, and we appreciate her good service, and we look forward to working with Dr. Savia.

211
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,183
Thank you very much.

212
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:17,943
Welcome.

213
00:14:18,203 --> 00:14:18,363
Ms.

214
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:18,883
Van de Kloot.

215
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:20,104
Approval?

216
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:22,725
There's a motion on the floor for approval, seconded by Ms.

217
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:23,545
Disceri.

218
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:24,666
All those in favor?

219
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:25,226
Aye.

220
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:26,027
A roll call?

221
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,567
Opposed?

222
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:27,887
Motion passes.

223
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,248
Excuse me, I believe Ms.

224
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:29,668
Van de Kloot.

225
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:30,088
Oh, sorry.

226
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:30,508
Roll call?

227
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:30,969
Yeah.

228
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,830
What kind of needs do we usually call

229
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:36,339
are on, just so people understand.

230
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:45,708
Well, the doctors will sit on our school health advisory committee, where we discuss different health and wellness issues.

231
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:49,091
We make plans for different initiatives.

232
00:14:49,152 --> 00:14:54,577
Some of the initiatives we have done have been different health policies.

233
00:14:55,518 --> 00:15:02,248
setting up parent education forums, getting the SBIRT screening going, NARCAN training.

234
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:06,615
So we always, you know, we consult with the school physician on that.

235
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:16,457
He'll also consult with our athletic trainer and review the concussion and injury, athletic injury reports on a season-by-season basis.

236
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:18,458
Let's see.

237
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:30,704
I mean, if a case came up that, like the tuberculosis outbreak that we had last year, that exposure, we consulted with Dr. Goodell on how to move through and handle that.

238
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:39,349
type of health concern that we feel we just want support and consultation on.

239
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,670
I can reach out to him.

240
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:41,611
Thank you.

241
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:41,931
Good.

242
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:43,432
It's a pleasure to meet you.

243
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:43,973
Thank you.

244
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:45,574
Roll call vote.

245
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:46,715
Thank you.

246
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:48,696
Yes.

247
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:53,560
Yes.

248
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,781
Yes.

249
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:56,042
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

250
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:56,722
Motion passes.

251
00:15:57,242 --> 00:15:57,843
Thank you very much.

252
00:15:57,863 --> 00:15:58,103
Thank you.

253
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:09,956
Item 3, report on tier 2 E-rate funding award.

254
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:10,857
Mr. Superintendent.

255
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:20,830
So this particular report is letting you know that the federal government has now approved our E-rate tier 2 funding, which is a substantial amount of money.

256
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:22,532
It needs to be matched.

257
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:28,909
If it's approved here this evening that will go forward, I'll go to the City Council at a future date to ask for the matching funds.

258
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:39,031
It will allow us to expand our infrastructure to support our networks, to increase our switches and all the other aspects of the infrastructure that supports technology.

259
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:45,373
Kirstine Patterson is a lead person locally on this and she's going to tell you a little bit more about it.

260
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:51,094
Yes, thank you, members of the committee.

261
00:16:51,114 --> 00:16:58,359
This is very exciting news for us, as not all school districts that request the Category 2 funding receive it.

262
00:16:58,459 --> 00:16:59,700
So this is very significant.

263
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:10,467
Within the three categories that we applied for funding, we received funding for the firewalls in the amount of $17,015.

264
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,028
For wireless internet connectivity, we received $101,649.

265
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:27,609
And within the switches and the internal connections, we received $265,186 from the federal match.

266
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:35,652
So this is very significant with 60% of the overall project cost being funded by the federal government.

267
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:44,835
So we are hopeful to receive the approval to move forward and request the city side match for this very important

268
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:50,811
infrastructure improvement that will help all of our schools, school buildings as well.

269
00:17:52,333 --> 00:18:00,920
Again, the coordination scheduling still needs to be taken into consideration as this is a very extensive project.

270
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:11,268
Even with the approvals, we would not be able to actually begin the work until toward the end of June of 2018.

271
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:14,471
So this would be likely a summer project

272
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:20,601
So that has the least impact on instruction and the school day.

273
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,623
Did you say work will begin in 2017 or 18?

274
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:23,904
I'm sorry, 18.

275
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:24,865
Yes.

276
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:25,485
So June of 18.

277
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:26,906
Correct.

278
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:29,108
Because we have to get the funding in line now.

279
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:32,391
We have to provide the approval for a city side match.

280
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:37,656
Then we engage the contractor, issue the purchase orders, and then start the scheduling out.

281
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:52,558
but because of the massive amounts of infrastructure and the downtime that that would create, we don't want to actually begin that until we have enough time where we don't have instruction going on in critical moments.

282
00:18:52,598 --> 00:19:03,964
I mean, there could be some that would be attempted to be done during the school vacation weeks, but the majority, the major switches in those components would be done likely in July of 2018.

283
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,621
Miss Van de Kloot.

284
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:14,586
So is this then do we need to go before the City Council to ask for this match?

285
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:14,926
Yes.

286
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:15,446
Yes, we do.

287
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:15,666
Yes.

288
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:20,790
And would this be part of a capital improvement plan or would this be a standalone item?

289
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,231
I would anticipate a free cash vote.

290
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:23,292
OK.

291
00:19:23,592 --> 00:19:25,874
And so we need to move on this relatively quickly.

292
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:27,215
We need to vote tonight so that we can.

293
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:27,675
Right.

294
00:19:27,715 --> 00:19:33,880
So I'd make a motion for approval because obviously anything that we can do to improve our infrastructure

295
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:35,909
is absolutely worth doing.

296
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,817
And so I make a motion to approve and to send this forward to the city council for their approval.

297
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:42,878
For the matching amount of $291,150.

298
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:43,218
Thank you.

299
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,660
Is there a second on this motion?

300
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:44,840
Second.

301
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:52,413
Mr. Benedetto.

302
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,094
Thank you.

303
00:19:53,114 --> 00:20:15,682
Um, so through you to the superintendent, if you need a school committee members to go with you, um, to the city council to ask for matching funds, um, I'm offering to be available and, uh, stand with you because, um, technology is so important and especially, um, all the firewall and all the protective things.

304
00:20:16,102 --> 00:20:17,383
We just really need this.

305
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:20,470
And we need to keep growing with technology.

306
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,111
And I'm sure that they'll agree.

307
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:26,156
But if you would like any help going forward, just let me know.

308
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:26,916
Thank you.

309
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:27,697
Thank you.

310
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:29,599
Pardon me.

311
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:34,885
I worked it out the date with the mayor and based on what's on their calendar.

312
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:40,692
Very good.

313
00:20:40,712 --> 00:20:44,793
There's a motion on the floor, seconded by Mr. Skerry and Mr. Benedetto.

314
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:45,773
Roll call vote, please.

315
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:49,414
Yes.

316
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:54,736
Yes.

317
00:20:55,116 --> 00:20:55,596
Yes.

318
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:57,056
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

319
00:20:57,096 --> 00:20:57,816
Motion passes.

320
00:20:58,417 --> 00:20:59,397
Thank you very much for that.

321
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:02,898
Report on Veterans Day program.

322
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:11,298
So every year we have a Veterans Day program, and Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli is the coordinator, and she's going to come up and tell you about the program.

323
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:19,004
Good evening.

324
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:22,727
Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and members of the Medford School Committee.

325
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:29,433
Tonight I'm here to report on a longstanding tradition on the secondary level in the Medford Public Schools.

326
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:35,204
It's one of my favorite events, and this year was no exception.

327
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:54,555
So the Medford Public Schools and the Office of Veteran Services here at Medford City Hall have teamed up over the course of the past 17 years to provide students and faculty on the high school level the opportunity to learn about combat and non-combat related experience of our city's veterans.

328
00:21:55,155 --> 00:21:58,657
And from all accounts, this program has been enormously successful.

329
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:09,183
And it's been fulfilling not only to our students, but also to the adults, the teachers and administrators who have seen the speeches that these veterans give.

330
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:17,829
This year's program occurred on Thursday, November 2nd, and was co-coordinated with the Director of Veterans Services, Ernest Lindsey.

331
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:22,841
The day began early in the morning before period one in the superintendent's conference room.

332
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,463
We were treated to a light breakfast.

333
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:33,169
The mayor, Mayor Burke, did attend this, as did school committee member Kathy Kratz.

334
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:44,378
They greeted the veteran speakers, and we all participated in the welcoming address, which included the Pledge of Allegiance and a brief introduction by each of the participants.

335
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:57,811
This year, 27 veterans from several eras, including the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, and the Iraq War, visited 38 classes and gave an overview of their experiences and contributions.

336
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:04,114
Sadly, though, this year we did not have any World War II veterans or Korean era veterans.

337
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:12,578
Over the time that I have been organizing this event, each year you get fewer and fewer members from those eras.

338
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:21,702
The program provides our students with an oral history of personal experiences that enhances their study of history in the classroom.

339
00:23:22,423 --> 00:23:28,749
Feedback from students, teachers, and veterans from this year's program has been overwhelmingly positive.

340
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:36,877
We are thankful to Dunkin' Donuts and West Medford for donating coffee and a generous assortment of treats for breakfast.

341
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:40,289
They've done so for the past, I believe, 17 years.

342
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,011
So we really want to shout out to Dunkin' Donuts and West Medford.

343
00:23:43,711 --> 00:24:01,702
Would also like to thank Grade 12 Medford Vocational Technical High School student Noah Kratz for displaying many items from his vintage military collection and engaging our guests in meaningful conversations about the importance of historical artifacts and understanding our nation's history.

344
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:06,365
Again, one of the proudest things that I think we offer is this program.

345
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,899
And I am thrilled that we are 17 years strong into it.

346
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:12,184
I'm happy to take any questions.

347
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:13,447
Great program.

348
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:14,229
Thank you.

349
00:24:19,986 --> 00:24:20,766
What's going on?

350
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:22,367
Actually, for Miss Riccadeli.

351
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:25,268
It's OK.

352
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:26,088
No problem.

353
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:31,330
Actually, my question is, well, first of all, I just want to say thank you to all the veterans that come each and every year.

354
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,112
As you said, it's been a 17-year program that you've been running.

355
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:39,053
And it's been fabulous, because I know the students get a lot out of it, just as much as the veterans do.

356
00:24:39,973 --> 00:24:43,455
And also, a thank you, if we can, send a letter to Mr. Lindsay.

357
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:48,577
Who's the director of the veterans just to just as it as a thank-you note from us?

358
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:53,899
But the other thing is is that you were speaking of we don't have the veterans anymore from certain errors.

359
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,260
Is it possible?

360
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:10,587
I mean, I don't know this is just to throw it out there, but Maybe invite like children of the veterans from that era that have heard the stories that still have stories to share and just give an insight to our students from that era and

361
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:13,323
I think that's a great suggestion.

362
00:25:13,343 --> 00:25:20,525
I actually have a 96-year-old uncle who was in World War II, went down in two ships, used to live in Ninetyside and Riverside Ave.

363
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:33,190
I've been trying to get him to come because he tells a great story, but he really is just very shy and gets very emotional at the stories that he shares with his closest family.

364
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,188
I think that's a wonderful suggestion.

365
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:36,489
I certainly will work on it.

366
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:42,311
As I think about, even though I know his stories, I certainly could not do them the justice that he would.

367
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:44,211
But again, I think it's a great suggestion.

368
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:45,852
If I could just say one other thing.

369
00:25:46,232 --> 00:25:49,393
Nicole Chiesa, Dr. Nicole Chiesa is the Director of Humanities

370
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:55,240
So in her absence, she's still on a leave of absence, I stepped in this year.

371
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,523
So I believe not this year, but the prior three years, Nicole did organize it with Nick Cain.

372
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:04,565
So I don't want it to be misleading that I've been doing this for 17 years.

373
00:26:04,685 --> 00:26:08,848
Certainly there have been several of us in the process over those 17 years.

374
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:10,840
Thank you.

375
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:12,121
Oh, you're welcome.

376
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:19,307
And also a letter to Mr. Kretz, who Noah's been an amazing asset to a lot of these programs.

377
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:26,752
And his enthusiasm and his experience, even though he hasn't, thankfully, gone, but he does have a lot of knowledge.

378
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:30,555
So it's really nice to see a young student who shares that.

379
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:31,336
That's great.

380
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:32,116
Ms.

381
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:32,737
DiBenedetto.

382
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,238
Thank you.

383
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:39,542
So given that your uncle's shy and that you'd love him to come, but he's not capable of

384
00:26:39,993 --> 00:26:44,396
Can't you video him telling his story and bring it forward that way?

385
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,837
I've suggested that to him.

386
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:48,818
Just on your phone, even?

387
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:51,320
Because then you can transfer it.

388
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,701
We have the technology up there now.

389
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:57,383
And maybe just even your conversation with him.

390
00:26:57,944 --> 00:26:59,885
I mean, it might impact.

391
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:04,425
greatly and it might be something that your family will always charge her as well.

392
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:08,711
And my second thing is, could you send a thank you note to the Dunkin Donuts as well?

393
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:13,416
17 years of providing food for all of them.

394
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:17,882
You know, at 20 years we should have them come in and, you know,

395
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:20,014
Give him a golden donut.

396
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:21,276
Give him some donuts?

397
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,420
We'll give him some donuts.

398
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:29,967
On the paper, as amended, that thank yous be sent out to the respective parties.

399
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:30,868
All those in favor?

400
00:27:30,888 --> 00:27:31,469
Aye.

401
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:32,209
All those opposed?

402
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,030
Motion passes.

403
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:33,972
Thank you.

404
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:35,113
Thanks.

405
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:37,436
I just wanted to say thank you also.

406
00:27:38,643 --> 00:27:45,125
I want to say thank you to all the veterans for coming out to discuss their experiences with the students.

407
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:50,906
And I want to give a very special thanks to Ernst Lindsey, Bernadette Riccadeli for organizing the program.

408
00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:55,287
And I just wanted to share a mention from Noah.

409
00:27:55,427 --> 00:27:58,868
And he said he really, really enjoys doing this program.

410
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:01,629
And it's a pleasure going to all the veterans programs.

411
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:05,730
He also went to the VFW program, and he showed

412
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:11,390
his collection with the Cub Scouts, Webelos, and the veterans that attended that program.

413
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,954
So it's just something, his passion, that he really likes to do, and he wished he could be here tonight, but he has work.

414
00:28:16,354 --> 00:28:17,856
So I just wanted to share that with everybody.

415
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:18,977
Thank you very much.

416
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,077
Thank you, Ms.

417
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:20,398
Kretz.

418
00:28:22,812 --> 00:28:29,222
Recommendation to accept major gift from stop and shop to vocational school and food service program, Mr. Superintendent.

419
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:32,989
Well, Mayor and members of the school committee, tonight we're going to prove there is such a thing as a free lunch.

420
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,594
So Kirsten is going to cover that for us.

421
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:43,541
Yes, if I could have it noted, the director of finance is bringing you money this evening.

422
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:58,017
Yes, we're very excited to present that our local stop and shop has generously given the intended donation of $10,000 to the new vocational Bistro 489.

423
00:28:59,497 --> 00:29:07,963
And they are also going to fund one full day of lunch for the entire district, which is the equivalent of $7,500.

424
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:12,205
So we're very excited.

425
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:18,810
We need a roll call.

426
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,571
Is there a motion to accept this gift?

427
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:22,812
Motion to accept by Mr. Scarry.

428
00:29:23,353 --> 00:29:24,894
Seconded by Ms.

429
00:29:24,934 --> 00:29:25,114
Cunha.

430
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:25,594
You have a question?

431
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:32,794
So my question was, it's a wonderful thing.

432
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:42,196
I'm sure we're going to be very conscientious of making sure that we have lunches for all kids, no matter what their allergies might be or something like that.

433
00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:42,657
Absolutely.

434
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,197
That's always a consideration on every menu.

435
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:45,717
OK.

436
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,318
And the second question I had to do had to do with

437
00:29:49,218 --> 00:29:56,862
In the report, it said, as discussed, signs signifying Stop and Shop's donation will be placed inside the bistro, and we will receive content, i.e.

438
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,543
photos, for marketing and media relations purposes.

439
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:07,727
So I just wondered what exactly the, I could certainly see other people approaching other

440
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:12,644
food stores for donations as well or for assistance.

441
00:30:13,184 --> 00:30:22,708
And so I just want to make sure that because Stop and Shop has their sign that it is open to other perhaps generous givers in the future.

442
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:23,708
Absolutely.

443
00:30:23,728 --> 00:30:34,473
And in our discussions, we indicated, you know, the possibility of some, you know, nominal size plaque recognizing their generous donation at the startup of the program.

444
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:41,982
does not preclude anyone else any other significant donations and subsequent plaques and acknowledgment.

445
00:30:42,222 --> 00:30:43,223
OK, thank you, Chris.

446
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:45,304
Mr. Benedetto.

447
00:30:45,324 --> 00:30:46,385
Thank you.

448
00:30:46,565 --> 00:30:48,747
I just want to know how we're spending the $10,000.

449
00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:55,431
We haven't gotten it yet, so I don't want to spend it until we've actually received it.

450
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:57,332
I know, but what's the plan?

451
00:30:57,352 --> 00:30:59,033
I think it's going to the deck.

452
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:00,194
The deck?

453
00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:03,836
Oh, it's for a physical piece, not to stock with.

454
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:06,815
Because we're going to have to stock the kitchen at some point.

455
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:09,336
Well, it'll be stocked.

456
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:09,597
OK.

457
00:31:10,677 --> 00:31:15,000
The donation of the deck appears to be what's ticketed for.

458
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:15,961
OK.

459
00:31:16,461 --> 00:31:16,862
Good to know.

460
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:17,122
Thank you.

461
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:20,138
December 4th is the opening.

462
00:31:20,198 --> 00:31:21,960
December 4th and it's cast in stone?

463
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,162
11 o'clock.

464
00:31:23,302 --> 00:31:23,742
Yes.

465
00:31:23,762 --> 00:31:24,884
11 o'clock, December 4th.

466
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:25,945
Grand opening.

467
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:27,146
Ribbon cutting.

468
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:27,907
Yes.

469
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:32,652
Is there a motion on the floor for roll call vote for approval of the gift?

470
00:31:33,553 --> 00:31:34,294
Mrs. Cunha?

471
00:31:35,055 --> 00:31:35,295
Yes.

472
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:36,416
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

473
00:31:36,536 --> 00:31:36,777
Yes.

474
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:44,997
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

475
00:31:45,017 --> 00:31:45,337
Thank you.

476
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:50,259
Motion is accepted, and we'll send a letter of thanks to Jim Allen, the store manager of Stop and Shop Medford.

477
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,821
Recommendation to approve foreign language NYC trip.

478
00:31:57,681 --> 00:32:01,543
So we have a couple of foreign language approvals in front of us tonight.

479
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:04,864
We talked about them at our committee of the hall, so Rita is here.

480
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:09,106
First of all, let me congratulate Rita publicly for her award from

481
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:17,730
the Italian Association for her outstanding work as an Italian teacher and administrator promoting programs in Italian culture.

482
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:18,953
The other reason.

483
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:20,416
Thank you.

484
00:32:25,255 --> 00:32:37,506
The other evening, Friday evening, at the Dry Dock, the Innovation Center, Rita was there receiving audits from a whole pile of people who were involved in Italian culture, including the Consul General.

485
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:41,630
And Rita deserves all the work, all the credit that she gets.

486
00:32:42,191 --> 00:32:42,591
Thank you.

487
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,060
So good evening.

488
00:32:53,361 --> 00:33:03,207
As the superintendent said, the two items that have to do with me on the agenda were brought up last week at the committee of the whole.

489
00:33:03,787 --> 00:33:12,333
So the first one is asking your approval for the New York trip for December 17 and 18.

490
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:18,477
The 17th is a Sunday, so students would only be missing one day of school.

491
00:33:19,728 --> 00:33:28,152
This field trip is offered only to the AP Italian students of Miss Canetta's class, and it's only 10 students.

492
00:33:29,752 --> 00:33:36,956
They did a unit on the opera, and they really fell in love with the opera, and they went to see an opera in Boston.

493
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:41,818
And then as a follow-up activity, they Skyped with an opera singer.

494
00:33:42,805 --> 00:33:50,850
And she revealed that she's going to be singing at Carnegie Hall on the evening of the 17th, and students really wanted to go see her.

495
00:33:52,911 --> 00:34:09,580
The program for the 17th is on a rediscovered Italian composer, opera composer, and so they're going to be dedicating the evening to this composer, Aldo Finzi.

496
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:30,887
The opera singer, whose name is Elizabeth Herzenberg, sent the poetry of the songs that she's gonna be singing, of course in Italian, to the students, and they are studying that poetry in class, so it'll be a really meaningful field trip for them.

497
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:40,551
We received $3,000 scholarship, or $3,000 from the Michelina Pietrangelo Scholarship Fund

498
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,411
to cover the expenses.

499
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:46,252
So it said no cost to students.

500
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,313
The $3,000 covers everything.

501
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:54,336
The bus, the concert, the hotel, and everything.

502
00:34:55,936 --> 00:34:56,496
Both Ms.

503
00:34:56,556 --> 00:35:08,261
Caneto and I will serve as chaperones, and we will be traveling to New York by bus, attend the concert that Sunday evening, and return to Medford the next day.

504
00:35:17,153 --> 00:35:18,614
I just had a question about the bus.

505
00:35:19,054 --> 00:35:24,838
Is this a Bus that a private bus for these no, it's not a private bus.

506
00:35:24,978 --> 00:35:30,963
It's a mega bus leaves from South Station and Goes right, right.

507
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:35,146
I figured for the price it had to be but I just want yes I hope you guys have a wonderful time.

508
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:35,826
I wish I was going.

509
00:35:35,846 --> 00:35:36,166
Thank you.

510
00:35:36,447 --> 00:35:36,727
Yes.

511
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:36,987
I

512
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,940
There's a motion not for approval, but offered by Ms.

513
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,061
Cunha, seconded by Ms.

514
00:35:41,101 --> 00:35:41,741
Mustone.

515
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:43,401
Roll call vote, please.

516
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:44,742
Mrs. Cunha?

517
00:35:44,762 --> 00:35:45,462
Yes.

518
00:35:45,482 --> 00:35:46,262
Mrs. DiBenedetto?

519
00:35:46,282 --> 00:35:46,702
Yes.

520
00:35:46,722 --> 00:35:47,202
Mrs. Kratz?

521
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:47,882
Yes.

522
00:35:47,902 --> 00:35:48,502
Mrs. Mustone?

523
00:35:49,863 --> 00:35:50,063
Yes.

524
00:35:51,663 --> 00:35:53,384
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

525
00:35:53,404 --> 00:35:54,084
Motion passes.

526
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:54,824
Thank you.

527
00:35:54,844 --> 00:35:55,224
Have fun.

528
00:35:55,844 --> 00:35:56,104
Thanks.

529
00:35:56,124 --> 00:36:02,626
At this point, we would like to invite someone up to the podium, including you, Sandra Figueroa.

530
00:36:02,646 --> 00:36:04,166
Sandra Figueroa.

531
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:04,666
Figueroa.

532
00:36:04,686 --> 00:36:05,146
Figueroa.

533
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:06,407
Come on up, Sandra.

534
00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:07,107
Come on up.

535
00:36:07,127 --> 00:36:07,687
Come up there.

536
00:36:13,447 --> 00:36:15,888
This is a report on a foreign language scholarship.

537
00:36:22,511 --> 00:36:32,055
The Medford Public Schools is proud to recognize Sandra Figueroa, Outstanding Achievement in the Study of Italian at FAA USA 2017 scholarship recipient.

538
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,096
Congratulations.

539
00:36:46,785 --> 00:36:49,607
Sandra's going to say something in Italian.

540
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:51,148
OK.

541
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:52,289
Buonasera a tutti.

542
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:59,114
Voglio dire grazie alla signora e alla mia signora.

543
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:01,516
Sorry, I'm getting a little nervous.

544
00:37:03,858 --> 00:37:09,642
Mia maestra, la signora Canetta, per averme scelto per questo borsal di studio.

545
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:16,209
I love the Italian language, I love the culture.

546
00:37:16,769 --> 00:37:22,654
I speak Spanish and I wanted a challenge.

547
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:30,661
I chose Italian because it's a beautiful language and I want to use it in the future in my studies.

548
00:37:30,941 --> 00:37:33,163
Thank you.

549
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:42,207
Translate a little bit?

550
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:42,467
Okay.

551
00:37:42,487 --> 00:37:44,889
Sandra said that she's very happy to be studying Italian.

552
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:47,651
She loves Italian and she hopes to continue.

553
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:05,143
with Italian in college.

554
00:38:05,403 --> 00:38:07,264
She thanked me, I don't know why.

555
00:38:07,844 --> 00:38:13,087
But her teacher, her AP teacher, and also her middle school teacher, who's here, Ms.

556
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:13,848
Bonacorsi.

557
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:14,648
Very nice.

558
00:38:15,348 --> 00:38:21,732
Excellent, congratulations.

559
00:38:21,752 --> 00:38:22,412
Thank you.

560
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:45,607
You should have translated it.

561
00:38:47,689 --> 00:39:00,620
But actually there was one part that Mr. Carlo has missed and that is Sandra also said that she does speak Spanish and because she had the opportunity of taking Italian.

562
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,902
that she fell in love with the language and the culture.

563
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:16,989
And so that's an important piece, because no matter how many languages we speak as a district, when we have the opportunity, and here I have to say thank you to Cassett, because Cassett is where it starts in the elementary schools.

564
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:28,795
So, and it continues through the middle schools, and it continues to the high school, and it's a great opportunity for Cassett, but also a great opportunity for us, and to thank all the teachers that have always been involved, so thank you.

565
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:39,270
Medford High School student representative, Justin Sang, would like to say a few words.

566
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:52,721
I would like to reinforce what we just said in that students at Medford High are so, we're so dedicated to learning and a bunch of us are so dedicated to learning foreign languages.

567
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:59,607
And I wanted to say to Carlo, we don't say thank you enough for all that you've done for us.

568
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:03,470
And especially those in the AP class, they all love you so much.

569
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:17,997
effort in the future as we move forward to a more globalized and more open world.

570
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:22,343
We should continue with all of the efforts that we've put into our language learning programs.

571
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:23,024
Very nice.

572
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:24,026
Nice job, Justin.

573
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:38,407
This, I believe one of those scholarships came from the Joe Pachi and Son of Boston and Saugus Companies.

574
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:39,948
Am I correct, Mr. Carlo?

575
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:43,211
Joe Pachi put up the funds for the scholarship.

576
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:44,151
Very good.

577
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:47,174
There's a motion to receive this report and place it on file.

578
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:48,655
Moved by Ms.

579
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:50,176
VanDekloot, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

580
00:40:50,216 --> 00:40:50,956
All those in favor?

581
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:51,497
Aye.

582
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:52,257
All those opposed?

583
00:40:52,397 --> 00:40:53,058
Motion passes.

584
00:40:56,861 --> 00:41:05,831
recommendation to improve skills us a conference participation so each year members of the student body vocational school attend the

585
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:18,039
State Leadership Conference in Marlborough, SkillsUSA.

586
00:41:18,779 --> 00:41:23,441
And this year is no exception and we're going to be sending a couple of teachers and four students.

587
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:26,061
It will be paid for by grant money.

588
00:41:26,762 --> 00:41:34,384
They'll be staying overnight so that they can participate in the full range of activities and we need the school committee to approve it so that we can take this

589
00:41:35,428 --> 00:41:36,549
Trip on Schools USA.

590
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:37,510
Motion to approve.

591
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:38,010
Ms.

592
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:38,691
Vander Kloot.

593
00:41:39,692 --> 00:41:41,273
You know, this is an excellent thing.

594
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:43,015
And of course, we're going to approve it.

595
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:45,096
But I just want to set the record straight.

596
00:41:45,256 --> 00:41:50,741
In terms of timeliness of us receiving this, I believe the students left yesterday and are returning tomorrow.

597
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:58,328
Yeah, it was unfortunately a situation where Mr. Fallon is new to our system and didn't realize it needed to come into us.

598
00:41:58,968 --> 00:41:59,749
We wanted to bring it to you.

599
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:02,131
But certainly in the future, we understand it needs to come to you.

600
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,393
So it's a motion of approval, sort of in retrospect.

601
00:42:06,513 --> 00:42:09,295
But it's a great thing, and we know that it's wonderful for our students.

602
00:42:09,355 --> 00:42:14,058
I'm certainly glad that they're going, and I look forward to hearing from them on their return.

603
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,900
There's a motion for approval by Ms.

604
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,900
Cunha, seconded by Ms.

605
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,240
Kretz.

606
00:42:18,421 --> 00:42:19,322
Roll call vote, please.

607
00:42:20,203 --> 00:42:20,863
Excuse me?

608
00:42:25,506 --> 00:42:26,347
We're still approving it.

609
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,694
Sure, absolutely, absolutely

610
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:45,846
On the motion for approval as amended, roll call vote.

611
00:42:46,226 --> 00:42:46,887
Mrs. Cunha.

612
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:47,567
Yes.

613
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:48,427
Mrs. DiBenedetto.

614
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:49,047
Yes.

615
00:42:49,187 --> 00:42:49,788
Mrs. Kretz.

616
00:42:50,508 --> 00:42:50,628
Yes.

617
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:51,268
Mrs. McStone.

618
00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:51,928
Yes.

619
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:52,409
Mr. Scurry.

620
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:52,689
Yes.

621
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:53,549
Mrs. Vander Kloot.

622
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:53,829
Yes.

623
00:42:53,929 --> 00:42:54,429
Mayor Burke.

624
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:54,769
Yes.

625
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:56,950
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

626
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:00,251
Next up, report on professional development day, November 7, 2017.

627
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:04,473
We'll call on our assistant superintendent to deliver this report.

628
00:43:05,773 --> 00:43:06,214
Good evening.

629
00:43:06,274 --> 00:43:09,755
I'd like to call on Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli to come do the report with me, please.

630
00:43:15,047 --> 00:43:23,732
On Tuesday, November 7th, Medgar Public Schools and staff participated in our first professional development day for this school year.

631
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:31,656
Elementary staff met at the McGlynn School and participated in grade level workshops on response to intervention.

632
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:44,063
Teachers 21, a consulting firm from Newton Mass, worked with our staff to build a shared understanding of RTI fundamentals and help us consider our next steps.

633
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:53,290
Staff learned about the structures, processes, and instructional practices needed for successful implementation of RTI.

634
00:43:53,970 --> 00:44:03,014
In addition, staff collaboratively self-assessed current capacities and planned for the next steps for the implementation of RTI.

635
00:44:03,814 --> 00:44:08,956
The middle schools participated in Study Island as a universal screening behavioral intervention tool.

636
00:44:09,635 --> 00:44:17,762
Teachers learned to utilize study island questions and developed fall winter screener exams for grades six, seven, and eight.

637
00:44:18,642 --> 00:44:29,731
Administrators and teachers reviewed behavioral interventions and developed their own pyramid to determine what is considered tier one, tier two, and tier three.

638
00:44:30,492 --> 00:44:33,915
The Andrews and the McGlynn schools met at Medford High.

639
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:50,695
Medford High School vocational and Curtis Tufts participated in workshops regarding specific building-based data collection in focus groups discussions and identified topics from their ongoing partnerships with Harvard University and Boston College.

640
00:44:51,816 --> 00:45:04,360
Our paraprofessionals collaborated with each other in online curriculum in three research-based modules, independence, positive behavior supports, and effective communication.

641
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:12,556
The fine arts department focused on teaching pathways through the music curriculum as well as concepts in education.

642
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:19,699
Nurses, phys ed, and health education staff participated in safety care recertification training.

643
00:45:20,695 --> 00:45:39,710
There were additional workshops in the following areas, technology, library, zones of regulation for early childhood and related service providers, grade level and competency portfolios, alternate portfolios, middle school foreign language and curriculum review.

644
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:43,392
We had a jam-packed day on November 7th.

645
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:50,626
I'd like to share with you some of the evaluations from our elementary, middle, and high schools.

646
00:45:51,367 --> 00:45:57,617
For elementary, it was the ability to practice strategies in workshops, reinforcement of techniques,

647
00:45:58,363 --> 00:46:03,628
that the teachers felt able to engage, persist, envision, and reflect in the workshops.

648
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:06,331
Relevant topics were discussed.

649
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,614
Presenters were knowledgeable and engaging.

650
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:14,939
More time needed to be allowed for staff to collaborate, which is something that we need to work on.

651
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:21,786
There were useful suggestions for RTI, and we're hoping to plan return visits for RTI.

652
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:24,530
So none of this is done alone.

653
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,133
You've heard the saying, it takes a village.

654
00:46:27,614 --> 00:46:35,725
So it really does when we get together and organize and plan our Professional Development Day program.

655
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:40,211
I'd like Bernadette to speak a little bit to the middle school and high school reflections.

656
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:56,124
So the reflections of teachers and what they experienced on PD is very important to us as administrators, but then also I'm a member of the Professional Development Committee, so we will be looking at these comments closely.

657
00:46:56,144 --> 00:47:06,093
A lot of good comments, and then there are some comments that really offer us some constructive advice on ways that the program could be made even stronger.

658
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:07,944
So this is just a sampling.

659
00:47:08,104 --> 00:47:09,425
It certainly isn't everything.

660
00:47:09,585 --> 00:47:14,469
I do have a compilation of all of the responses from middle and high school teachers.

661
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:17,751
So for the middle school, some of the strengths were the following.

662
00:47:18,412 --> 00:47:24,276
One teacher wrote, quote, that we were able to create a screener for next year that aligns both middle schools.

663
00:47:24,996 --> 00:47:35,484
Another teacher wrote, the presenter, that would be Paul DeLeva, adjusted his presentation when he realized the audience needed or wanted something different on the content.

664
00:47:37,183 --> 00:47:42,886
Another teacher wrote, the presenter was a great speaker and made the workshop as interesting as possible.

665
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:50,590
I liked that we were given ample time to play around with the program, and he allowed the subject to veer off for more specific questions.

666
00:47:52,982 --> 00:47:57,825
Then another prompt asked teachers how the workshop could have been improved.

667
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:03,468
And one teacher wrote focusing on subjects other than English language arts and math.

668
00:48:04,788 --> 00:48:09,131
Another teacher wrote Chromebooks being provided to all staff during the training.

669
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:12,693
Another teacher wrote altering the order of the program.

670
00:48:13,693 --> 00:48:23,481
so that the morning should have been for the McGlynn to go over the basics of RTI, that is, what it is, what is the pyramid, what are the logistics, etc.

671
00:48:24,022 --> 00:48:32,209
Then the afternoon could have been on how to use Study Island as a tool in RTI and collaborate with grade-level partners from both schools.

672
00:48:32,986 --> 00:48:36,407
So again, that's just a snapshot of the middle school teachers' comments.

673
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:40,729
Again, some positive and some where there are things that could be better.

674
00:48:41,249 --> 00:48:46,490
With regard to the high school comments, one thing I noticed is many teachers wrote a lot.

675
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,862
Some of these are somewhat lengthy, but again, there's only a few of them.

676
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:59,268
So they were asked in the first prompt, what stood out about today's professional development program?

677
00:48:59,908 --> 00:49:08,075
One teacher wrote, the thing that stood out the most was the video we watched in breakout sessions about microaggressions and microaffirmations.

678
00:49:08,555 --> 00:49:17,322
It was a nice reminder to choose your words and the way you frame feedback carefully, as it can have a big impact on your students and their perceptions.

679
00:49:17,783 --> 00:49:24,088
That's certainly something I know that I like to consider when I'm speaking to people.

680
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:35,196
Another teacher wrote, just bringing into awareness the issues our kids are dealing with and the impact we have on making them feel included and capable, as well as happy and productive.

681
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:48,029
A good reminder of how important positive feedback is, our role in helping students finding their purpose, and in helping them to see how what they do here is relevant to the rest of their lives.

682
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:57,338
Another teacher wrote, this professional development day reminded me of how much the students need me as a teacher to create a safe environment for learning.

683
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:07,686
By safe environment, I mean an inclusive one in which I demonstrate to each student that I care about each of them as people and I believe in their academic capabilities.

684
00:50:08,086 --> 00:50:14,331
It reminded me to review my own journey as a professional and to renew my commitment to the profession.

685
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:24,599
And the last comment from a teacher, the teacher writes, my biggest takeaway was that wow, this is really necessary.

686
00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:29,322
However, I don't think that it was received by all faculty.

687
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:34,446
I am very familiar with what was presented and I am well attuned to my passion and my purpose.

688
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:38,288
It is something I live and it is something I share with my students.

689
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:42,551
However, I saw that many of my peers were very closed

690
00:50:43,848 --> 00:50:44,969
to today's PD day.

691
00:50:45,469 --> 00:50:51,234
I think that we as a faculty need to be brought through each step in order for people to see the value in this work.

692
00:50:51,714 --> 00:50:54,896
I heard many people say that it was too much information at once.

693
00:50:55,537 --> 00:51:02,222
So again, all of the feedback is considered seriously, and this was just a snapshot.

694
00:51:04,404 --> 00:51:04,564
Ms.

695
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:05,264
Vandekloot.

696
00:51:05,324 --> 00:51:06,445
No, I didn't have a question.

697
00:51:06,765 --> 00:51:07,986
Are there any questions from the body?

698
00:51:09,187 --> 00:51:09,848
Mr. Benedetto.

699
00:51:11,543 --> 00:51:16,886
So last year at our budget time, there was big talk about adding more ITI instruction.

700
00:51:17,847 --> 00:51:29,192
And this year is the year that we're really taking notice of where we are, what we're using it, how we're using it well, and where we're going to need in case we need that for next year's budget.

701
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:32,014
So you guys are the experts.

702
00:51:32,174 --> 00:51:33,374
Let's hear it.

703
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:34,415
We're at this point.

704
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,254
Are we utilizing it well?

705
00:51:37,274 --> 00:51:42,935
Do you foresee us needing some more help in the budget for next year?

706
00:51:43,575 --> 00:51:50,297
And I know it will change from now to then, but we need to put the bug in the ear of the superintendent so it's on his radar.

707
00:51:50,997 --> 00:51:51,257
Sure.

708
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:58,699
So the elementary teachers now have a universal screening tool piloted in just grade one.

709
00:51:59,179 --> 00:52:03,700
We're going to take a look at this tool to see if it's something that we want for all of our grade levels.

710
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:05,574
That was our beginning.

711
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,820
We wanted to give an overview of response to intervention.

712
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:20,092
Many of our teachers knew a lot about it because we've done some of this before, but we have a lot of new staff, so we wanted to make sure that they were able to participate.

713
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:31,921
We did grade level groups, K1, 2, 3, and 4, 5, and the presenters seemed to be, for the most part, very well received, especially the K1 presenter.

714
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:41,269
From here, we will have the Professional Development Committee is recommending that we continue with RTI on our mandated PD days.

715
00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:51,833
We have one in January and one in February, and we're hoping to continue our training in January and in February, and maybe even on the March PD day.

716
00:52:53,334 --> 00:53:05,500
The grade one in all of the elementary schools will be piloting RTI, so they have a specific block of time that will be set aside for teachers to work with each other on RTI.

717
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,782
And I think it is the hope that we get together in March or April

718
00:53:11,457 --> 00:53:16,538
to come to a consensus about the best way to roll it out for everyone come next September.

719
00:53:17,738 --> 00:53:19,719
Additional monies would be helpful.

720
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:23,760
We're going to try to work within the budget to see what we can do with our own staff.

721
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,700
They know our children better than anybody else.

722
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:29,121
Thank you.

723
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:34,402
Is there a motion on the floor to receive this paper and place it on file?

724
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:37,812
Seconded by Ms.

725
00:53:37,832 --> 00:53:38,412
Van De Kloet.

726
00:53:38,892 --> 00:53:39,633
All those in favor?

727
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,054
All those opposed?

728
00:53:41,494 --> 00:53:42,214
Motion passes.

729
00:53:44,376 --> 00:53:46,857
Report on MSBA school maintenance study.

730
00:53:47,117 --> 00:53:47,998
Mr. Superintendent.

731
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:55,022
Mayor and members of the school committee, I think we all know that building maintenance, building condition, is a popular topic.

732
00:53:57,304 --> 00:54:00,966
The MSBA, Massachusetts School Building Authority,

733
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:11,718
is the authority that's been put in place to assist with renovations, major renovations of schools, but they also try to keep track of where schools are.

734
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:20,863
Now, we all know where the pimples are and where the tiles are missing in any one school in our own world.

735
00:54:21,403 --> 00:54:24,745
But when you look at the range of schools across the Commonwealth,

736
00:54:25,738 --> 00:54:26,599
We don't do badly.

737
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:31,364
And the report I'm providing you is a report that it was done by MSBA.

738
00:54:31,985 --> 00:54:36,010
It was done by a field visit to our schools by MSBA.

739
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:41,195
And they went to all the schools across the Commonwealth, virtually all of them, didn't get to everything.

740
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:53,159
And they assessed and evaluated several key factors, including building condition, general environment, capacity, technology, security, and maintenance.

741
00:54:53,939 --> 00:55:01,505
The study was conducted by architectural engineers, engineers in general, and who visited each specific building.

742
00:55:03,146 --> 00:55:09,690
Now, school buildings that were slated for MSB upgrades, already slated in the pipeline, weren't visited because they already had been out there and done that.

743
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:12,953
The buildings were rated on a four-point scale.

744
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:16,328
the general condition and general learning environment.

745
00:55:16,988 --> 00:55:21,069
A rating of one was the best, and a rating of four was the lowest.

746
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:24,370
And all buildings were rated for capacity utilization.

747
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:32,453
Underutilization was considered to be 80% or less, below 80% rather, and overutilization was above 125% of the capacity of the building.

748
00:55:37,105 --> 00:55:40,346
So I provided you with selected pages of the MSBA report.

749
00:55:40,366 --> 00:55:41,266
It was 96 pages.

750
00:55:41,306 --> 00:55:44,707
I didn't think you wanted to read it all, but if you do, I can certainly provide it.

751
00:55:45,107 --> 00:55:51,648
I picked those pages I thought were relevant to us and would give us insights as to how they came up with these decisions.

752
00:55:52,248 --> 00:56:01,010
But you'll note if you go down to Medford schools and the building condition, all of our schools, with the exception of the high school and the vocational school, were rated one.

753
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:04,010
The high school and the vocational school were rated two.

754
00:56:05,271 --> 00:56:06,611
But all our buildings,

755
00:56:07,272 --> 00:56:15,101
for general environment were rated one based on their study, not something we did for them, not something we told them to say.

756
00:56:15,701 --> 00:56:18,104
They came out and rated it with their people.

757
00:56:18,905 --> 00:56:20,247
Now, building capacity,

758
00:56:22,428 --> 00:56:37,458
We fall into the average range in every building, while Brooks, Columbus, McGlynn, and Roberts are considered average, the Andrews a little bit under, McGlynn under, high school under, vocational under, and the Curtis Tufts under, in terms of capacity, in terms of room.

759
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:41,701
Now people talk to me about, is there capacity to absorb young people into our schools?

760
00:56:42,121 --> 00:56:42,622
I'd say yes.

761
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:49,156
Because I've looked at this, I gave you a report not that long ago on the impact of development upon enrollment.

762
00:56:49,876 --> 00:56:56,621
I'm working on a report that deals with some of the smaller buildings, which there aren't that many with young people in it.

763
00:56:57,081 --> 00:57:01,824
But clearly, that is not changing anything as far as I can see so far.

764
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:08,689
So I think it's important when people ask us about our building conditions to recognize that we have had them looked at.

765
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:11,191
There's certainly room for improvement.

766
00:57:11,231 --> 00:57:14,134
No one's going to say that we do everything the way it should be done.

767
00:57:14,855 --> 00:57:23,324
But clearly, we're not bad compared to buildings, school buildings around the commonwealth.

768
00:57:25,987 --> 00:57:31,033
We have put in an SOI to the state, statement of interest for the high school and the vocational school.

769
00:57:31,872 --> 00:57:37,273
We expect to hear before the first of the year whether or not we will be allowed to go to feasibility study.

770
00:57:37,933 --> 00:57:40,154
I believe we're now in a pool of 44.

771
00:57:40,494 --> 00:57:40,834
There were 88.

772
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,234
We're now down to 44.

773
00:57:43,274 --> 00:57:46,895
It may be less than that now since their last visit to us.

774
00:57:47,655 --> 00:57:54,436
And hopefully we'll hear about that and we'll be able to move forward with a feasibility study looking at those two major buildings.

775
00:57:54,956 --> 00:57:56,597
So happy to take any questions you may have.

776
00:57:56,617 --> 00:57:56,657
Ms.

777
00:57:58,577 --> 00:57:58,857
Pugno.

778
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:00,127
Thank you.

779
00:58:00,168 --> 00:58:07,556
Through you to the superintendent, is there a way for us to find out how the other schools in our area were graded?

780
00:58:07,976 --> 00:58:09,498
Well, they do have that.

781
00:58:10,058 --> 00:58:13,242
We're generally better than many others, but there are some.

782
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:14,023
I can get you that.

783
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:40,323
But yeah, I'd like to see the list of the surrounding schools and and just in general other schools Yeah, but it doesn't give that information just to see I can get you the rest of it just was a lot of pages No, and I understand that and I'm not asking for the whole report I'm just asking so that way we have an idea of where we rank compared to if it's okay with you What I'll do is I'll pick some area schools and give you you know some comparable type schools like Waltham and Winchester

784
00:58:41,243 --> 00:59:09,205
And then I guess my other concern is We rate you know according to their standards We rated high does is that jeopardize any type of grant or anything that we're going to be going for because I mean Because we we graded very high based on their requisites I just don't want to jeopardize anything out there that we're waiting for like capital planning money or anything like that I mean are they going to take that into consideration obviously they're going to look at buildings that are for and

785
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,961
But they also want to, if they put an app in.

786
00:59:14,461 --> 00:59:19,923
And they also want to make sure that buildings that are doing okay, stay okay.

787
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,104
And there are specific elements of our world.

788
00:59:24,004 --> 00:59:28,786
Like in our world, we want to work on the systems in the high school and the vocation school.

789
00:59:28,806 --> 00:59:29,826
We want to work on the shops.

790
00:59:30,346 --> 00:59:35,068
We want to work on other aspects of the facility that will enhance it over time.

791
00:59:35,508 --> 00:59:37,648
Remember that building is, what, over 45 years old now.

792
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:44,191
It's a solid building, it's not going away, but it can use some upgrades.

793
00:59:44,891 --> 00:59:48,453
And I think these are the things that we want to push with them.

794
00:59:48,473 --> 00:59:49,973
So we had a very good meeting with them.

795
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:56,375
I thought when they left, they were very pleased with the kind of tour that we took with them and the information we gave them.

796
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,316
But it's competitive, so we'll find out.

797
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:04,318
And was the tour across the board, like when they came to the high school, did they see the whole high school?

798
01:00:04,718 --> 01:00:06,118
Oh, they went around the whole place.

799
01:00:06,178 --> 01:00:07,399
And the same thing with all the other schools?

800
01:00:07,419 --> 01:00:08,159
They went around the whole place.

801
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:13,033
Now remember, we've got an oil project from them, we've got the science projects from them.

802
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,601
You know, we've got some other things from them as well.

803
01:00:15,641 --> 01:00:18,323
So it isn't like they've ignored us.

804
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:24,466
But clearly, you know, the things we were talking about with them were, I think, well-received.

805
01:00:24,486 --> 01:00:25,087
OK.

806
01:00:25,207 --> 01:00:31,671
I just don't want them to say that they went into the science labs at the high school and just assumed that the rest of the school is like that, because it's not.

807
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,352
Well, actually, I turned that around on them.

808
01:00:33,392 --> 01:00:35,713
When I said to them, see, your money really was put to good use.

809
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:35,813
Good.

810
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,295
Keep on telling them that, because it has to go through the whole district.

811
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:39,355
We're very good with your money.

812
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:40,176
You should give us more.

813
01:00:40,876 --> 01:00:41,156
OK?

814
01:00:41,476 --> 01:00:42,277
Yeah, the whole district.

815
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:43,867
Ms.

816
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:44,527
Mustone.

817
01:00:45,388 --> 01:00:51,550
Mr. Belson, the key factors were building condition, general environment, capacity, technology, security, and maintenance.

818
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,851
Did they give us a rating in each of those categories of each of the schools?

819
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:56,011
I think they composited.

820
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,752
The report did not break it down.

821
01:00:58,032 --> 01:00:59,672
To see where we have holes.

822
01:00:59,933 --> 01:01:00,653
They don't break it down.

823
01:01:00,673 --> 01:01:01,473
They didn't break it down.

824
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:03,794
But I can ask.

825
01:01:03,854 --> 01:01:04,254
Thank you.

826
01:01:04,274 --> 01:01:06,895
Are there any other questions?

827
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:09,540
Motion to receive and place on file?

828
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,701
Moved by Ms.

829
01:01:10,741 --> 01:01:12,002
Van de Kloot, seconded by Ms.

830
01:01:12,162 --> 01:01:12,582
Cuno.

831
01:01:12,862 --> 01:01:13,563
All those in favor?

832
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:13,643
Aye.

833
01:01:14,343 --> 01:01:15,044
All those opposed?

834
01:01:15,344 --> 01:01:16,044
Motion passes.

835
01:01:19,386 --> 01:01:24,109
Recommendation to implement a succession plan for superintendent of schools.

836
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:31,594
And before I pass this over to Roy, he's been with the school system for over 40 years?

837
01:01:31,614 --> 01:01:31,994
50 years now?

838
01:01:32,354 --> 01:01:32,655
50 years.

839
01:01:32,675 --> 01:01:33,655
23 as our superintendent.

840
01:01:37,038 --> 01:01:43,281
He has served this community with pride and respect, and I know throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts how he is looked upon.

841
01:01:43,901 --> 01:01:50,864
He really is a mentor to new superintendents, and just about any question you ask him, he pretty much knows the answer.

842
01:01:50,904 --> 01:01:52,584
It's somewhere in there, and he pulls it out.

843
01:01:52,665 --> 01:01:56,366
So it's been an amazing experience to work with you, Mr. Superintendent.

844
01:01:57,086 --> 01:02:01,168
And I know that this process will be difficult, but of course it will be positive at the end.

845
01:02:01,288 --> 01:02:05,670
We know that we will find someone that will do things differently and maybe

846
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:09,192
ignite the school system in a different way.

847
01:02:09,352 --> 01:02:13,115
So we will miss you, but we look forward to this process.

848
01:02:13,216 --> 01:02:14,076
Mr. Superintendent.

849
01:02:14,617 --> 01:02:15,998
You want to announce it Monday night?

850
01:02:16,018 --> 01:02:16,798
You want to talk about that?

851
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:17,079
Yes.

852
01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:22,263
Actually, we have arranged for the school committee.

853
01:02:22,523 --> 01:02:23,124
M-A-S-C.

854
01:02:23,784 --> 01:02:28,968
Mass Association of School Committees to come and visit with us Monday evening so that we can start this process.

855
01:02:29,028 --> 01:02:32,291
And they'll go over generalities of how they've conducted it in other communities.

856
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:38,583
and determined what steps we want to take next as far as our search for the next superintendent.

857
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:46,067
So that will be Monday at 6 30 at 6 30 at the high school, at the high school.

858
01:02:49,689 --> 01:02:50,550
Mr. Superintendent.

859
01:02:51,511 --> 01:02:58,535
So in June 2016, the Medford school committee approved the succession plan for the position of superintendent of schools.

860
01:02:59,335 --> 01:03:02,896
I have attached a copy of that plan to my remarks this evening.

861
01:03:03,957 --> 01:03:12,800
While it's within your discretion to keep, modify, and change the plan, it is a fundamental blueprint to begin the processes of succession and transition.

862
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:21,343
And that will continue on Monday evening with Glenn Kuchar, who is the executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

863
01:03:22,884 --> 01:03:25,405
It has been my privilege and honor

864
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:35,522
to be an educator in Medford, in the Medford Public Schools, for 50 years, and to serve as superintendent of schools, your superintendent of schools, for 23 years.

865
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:47,085
I've greatly benefited from the high quality and diligence of professionals, support staff, school committee members, and citizens who have worked with me throughout my career.

866
01:03:48,186 --> 01:03:53,027
And I am internally grateful to them for making my tenure and responsibilities

867
01:03:53,605 --> 01:03:57,287
as productive and as rewarding as reasonably possible.

868
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:04,732
I've been very fortunate to have seen former students become teachers, administrators, and staff in our schools.

869
01:04:05,632 --> 01:04:10,695
I've had the experience of enrolling children and grandchildren of former students.

870
01:04:12,256 --> 01:04:22,502
While no one does significant work alone, I've had the opportunity to build new schools, establish a full range of programs, acquire hundreds of millions of dollars in grants,

871
01:04:23,346 --> 01:04:24,727
for our community and school district.

872
01:04:26,287 --> 01:04:34,371
Understandably, there's room for improvement, but much has been done and more will be done in the months ahead.

873
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:42,515
No one gets to finish everything, but we have put a lot in place and that will be a solid foundation for the future.

874
01:04:43,835 --> 01:04:46,737
Therefore, I am here informing the Medford School Committee

875
01:04:47,963 --> 01:04:57,568
that it's my intention to retire from the position of superintendent of schools, Medford Public Schools, at the completion of my contract on June 30th, 2018.

876
01:04:57,688 --> 01:05:06,852
This decision has been made without reference to any governmental change or any issues that are in our community.

877
01:05:07,632 --> 01:05:15,236
It is simply the right period of time for me to spend more time with my family and to pursue special causes and interests

878
01:05:15,827 --> 01:05:21,891
that have not been possible given the schedule and work responsibilities of an active school superintendent.

879
01:05:23,031 --> 01:05:28,095
It is my intent and plan to be fully engaged in the months ahead as your superintendent.

880
01:05:28,895 --> 01:05:32,718
We have a lot of positive opportunities, some of which we've talked about tonight, ahead of us.

881
01:05:33,538 --> 01:05:37,160
And I will do everything possible to optimize and achieve our goals.

882
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:43,484
Furthermore, I will be committed to ensuring a smooth and effective transition to new senior leadership.

883
01:05:44,265 --> 01:05:44,585
Thank you.

884
01:06:09,706 --> 01:06:10,186
Thank you very much.

885
01:06:10,486 --> 01:06:12,827
I just personally want to thank the superintendent.

886
01:06:13,347 --> 01:06:14,367
Obviously, I'm a new mayor.

887
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,568
I'm just almost wrapping up the first two years.

888
01:06:18,149 --> 01:06:22,890
And I don't know what it would have been had I not had him by my side in charge of the school department.

889
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:31,092
So I thank you personally for staying on so that we've had a smoother transition into my leadership.

890
01:06:31,412 --> 01:06:35,214
So thank you very much for doing that on behalf of the city of Medford in total.

891
01:06:35,674 --> 01:06:35,854
Ms.

892
01:06:35,874 --> 01:06:36,294
Van de Kloot.

893
01:06:37,846 --> 01:06:42,068
So Roy, we knew this day would come, but it doesn't make the coming any easier.

894
01:06:42,488 --> 01:06:44,629
You've been an exceptional leader for our community.

895
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:50,973
Your commitment and dedication is simply, it can't be, it's unparalleled.

896
01:06:52,954 --> 01:06:57,496
I've been on the school committee for a long time, so I've known and been able to work with you for a long time.

897
01:06:58,036 --> 01:07:03,159
And I have to tell you, the number of nights that I found you in your office

898
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:13,245
night after night after night, ready to respond to any question, ready to be there, is just unbelievable.

899
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:22,571
And also, as a school committee, we can get to pick up the phone and call the superintendent, and it didn't matter was it weekend, it didn't matter whether he was on vacation.

900
01:07:23,611 --> 01:07:32,016
And so some of us have talked to him when he was on vacation, and he was always there ready to answer questions.

901
01:07:33,597 --> 01:07:42,581
I think of your great compassion to staff members who were under duress as something that was truly, you know, always unsung.

902
01:07:42,881 --> 01:07:44,082
It was always below the level.

903
01:07:44,442 --> 01:07:49,844
But when we had a staff member who was going through some crisis, Roy was always there and compassionate for them.

904
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:56,007
His dedication to our students and the whole child approach, I think on some of these things, you led the pack.

905
01:07:56,227 --> 01:08:01,870
Early childhood education, the Medford Family Network, so important in our world.

906
01:08:02,925 --> 01:08:06,147
No superintendent can be everything to everybody.

907
01:08:06,887 --> 01:08:09,589
Yep, superintendents piss people off sometimes.

908
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:10,629
They say no.

909
01:08:10,869 --> 01:08:11,970
And you've done that, Roy.

910
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:17,533
And I know that there have been people who've not always been enthusiastic about your leadership.

911
01:08:18,133 --> 01:08:27,819
But I, for one, as someone who has sat and worked with you, who've been on many different committees and worked with you, can only say that you have been a remarkable leader for us.

912
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:32,181
Your work ethic is just the tops, and you have

913
01:08:33,001 --> 01:08:36,904
Your dedication to Medford has been absolutely exemplary.

914
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:38,005
Thank you so much.

915
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:38,906
Thank you, Pauline.

916
01:08:38,926 --> 01:08:40,127
Thank you very much.

917
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:42,669
Ms.

918
01:08:42,689 --> 01:08:43,069
Cuno.

919
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:45,151
OK.

920
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:49,675
Well, I have had the opportunity, and I know what people are going to say out there.

921
01:08:49,855 --> 01:08:52,778
Oh, you know, the people that always agree with the superintendent.

922
01:08:53,158 --> 01:08:59,043
However, my discussion is not about whether I agree or disagree with the superintendent.

923
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:00,244
Here it is.

924
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:03,255
just a thank you for the person that he is.

925
01:09:04,296 --> 01:09:11,197
There's been many a times that there are a lot of us that agree or disagree, but this is out of respect, out of respect for the gentleman that's here.

926
01:09:12,217 --> 01:09:25,320
I've had the opportunity, not only as a Meffitt School Committee member, but also as a president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, to actually go around the state with Mr. Bellson to see how he has represented us,

927
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:30,963
always having us top of the list.

928
01:09:31,663 --> 01:09:42,309
I know people agree to disagree, but you really don't know it all when you're not behind this reel, unfortunately, because there are a lot of things that it's amazing to see.

929
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:50,874
When I went to the statehouse and there was a discussion and the superintendent went and he testified.

930
01:09:51,635 --> 01:09:54,476
And there were other superintendents there that day that were testifying.

931
01:09:55,056 --> 01:10:06,241
It's amazing to see the amount of people that after they're done with their discussion, the reporters and other people from the state house, all those superintendents were there.

932
01:10:07,721 --> 01:10:08,702
Everybody went to Roy.

933
01:10:09,642 --> 01:10:10,762
Who did he talk about?

934
01:10:11,443 --> 01:10:12,943
He talked about the people in this city.

935
01:10:13,623 --> 01:10:17,565
Not only the students and the parents, but the teachers and everybody else.

936
01:10:18,527 --> 01:10:27,715
Again, I don't want to talk about agreeing or disagreeing, because that's why we're here, to be respectful behind and in front of the reel.

937
01:10:28,636 --> 01:10:30,217
This is where you come to discuss.

938
01:10:30,617 --> 01:10:37,884
This is where you come to express what's going on.

939
01:10:38,264 --> 01:10:41,487
It's funny, Paulette just said something about he'll answer that phone.

940
01:10:42,621 --> 01:10:43,663
when he's on vacation.

941
01:10:44,264 --> 01:10:50,736
And I remember 12 years ago when I started and I wanted to bring the summer program into fruition.

942
01:10:51,717 --> 01:11:21,047
I remember going to that school the first day, and we had tons of kids there with parents dropping them off, and of course it was the hottest day, and the summer hadn't even started, and the people in charge had shut the air conditioning on me, and I called him, and he answered, and I'm like, I am sorry, but, and I went into a rage, and he's like, don't worry, he's like, the second I get off the plane, because I'm stepping on the plane, he says, I will call, and that air conditioning was on.

943
01:11:21,507 --> 01:11:32,095
So it's things like that that you remember, but honestly when I've had the opportunity to go around the state and I've had the opportunity nationally to tell people that we've had superintendents.

944
01:11:32,548 --> 01:11:36,491
It's amazing, because they say, what do you mean you have a superintendent who's been there all these years?

945
01:11:36,971 --> 01:11:39,673
You're lucky if you get someone who stays with you two to three years.

946
01:11:39,994 --> 01:11:40,654
And I've seen it.

947
01:11:41,294 --> 01:11:43,376
I've seen it in the communities around us.

948
01:11:43,476 --> 01:11:48,760
Right now, it's very difficult to get someone who's very qualified, because the candidate pool is not that large.

949
01:11:52,034 --> 01:11:52,935
It's just amazing.

950
01:11:52,995 --> 01:12:04,482
And when people tell me you work with a school committee, or you work as a school committee, or you actually speak to your superintendent, again, it seemed very strange to me, because I just assumed this is how it goes.

951
01:12:05,442 --> 01:12:12,126
I am in total shock when I hear other school committee members across the state that tell me, what are you talking about?

952
01:12:12,146 --> 01:12:14,067
What do you mean you have community participation?

953
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:16,769
I'm like, well, that's why we're here.

954
01:12:16,809 --> 01:12:17,810
We're here for the community.

955
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,050
They should have participation.

956
01:12:19,571 --> 01:12:19,811
Nope.

957
01:12:20,411 --> 01:12:21,332
They're not allowed to speak.

958
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:34,748
And so there are things that we just assume as a school committee member, as a parent, as a teacher, administrator, what we're used to sometimes, we're just assuming this is how it is across the board.

959
01:12:34,868 --> 01:12:36,849
And we're always complaining about what we have.

960
01:12:37,469 --> 01:12:45,715
But when you have the opportunity to go outside your city and to see what other things and other people are doing and other cities and towns are doing, again, there's always improvement.

961
01:12:46,935 --> 01:12:48,376
The bar is always raised up high.

962
01:12:48,937 --> 01:12:50,718
But to see where we are.

963
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:55,969
is just really, you know, it's, I'm very happy to see it.

964
01:12:56,189 --> 01:13:00,878
And I have to say that it's people like the superintendent who go out there with their passion.

965
01:13:02,157 --> 01:13:05,138
and get what we have, because it's not that easy sometimes.

966
01:13:05,638 --> 01:13:07,699
So I want to say thank you to the superintendent.

967
01:13:08,059 --> 01:13:08,480
Thank you.

968
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:09,920
Ms.

969
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:10,260
Kurtz.

970
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:13,702
Okay, Superintendent Bellson, I want to thank you for 50 years of service.

971
01:13:14,262 --> 01:13:17,963
I'm so glad that you stayed on because you... Oh, I'm sorry.

972
01:13:18,464 --> 01:13:19,324
It's not... Oh, sorry.

973
01:13:19,884 --> 01:13:24,906
I'm so glad that you were on for our first term and you made our transition very smooth.

974
01:13:25,747 --> 01:13:26,667
You're a great leader.

975
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:36,685
You've always been there for questions, like everybody said, via email, phone call, late nights, late Sundays, for little things that come up.

976
01:13:36,765 --> 01:13:40,267
And you've helped assist with, you know, parent inquiries.

977
01:13:40,787 --> 01:13:41,608
It's just everything.

978
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:46,610
And, you know, I'm just – I'm really grateful and I'm very fortunate that I got to work with you.

979
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,851
And, you know, it's bittersweet news.

980
01:13:48,931 --> 01:13:50,132
And, you know, I wish you the best.

981
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:53,554
And I'm, you know, happy to continue working with you for the next six months.

982
01:13:53,894 --> 01:13:54,234
Thank you.

983
01:13:54,314 --> 01:13:54,594
Thank you.

984
01:13:58,318 --> 01:14:00,299
On the paper, is there a motion to receive in place?

985
01:14:01,059 --> 01:14:01,979
You're not blinking up here.

986
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:03,860
Mr. Skerry.

987
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:16,185
Roy, it's been a long run, it's been a great run, and for anyone to spend 50 years of their life dedicated to education, it's remarkable and you're gonna be commended.

988
01:14:16,945 --> 01:14:25,248
And I want you to know, just as one member, my colleagues have said it best, but as one member, Medford is in a better place educationally

989
01:14:25,902 --> 01:14:30,285
through your efforts for the last 38 years that you've been running the system.

990
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:34,628
I don't think there is anyone that will master the budget as well as you.

991
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:38,191
We've all had concerns at budget time some years.

992
01:14:38,431 --> 01:14:44,355
It's been tough, but you've always found a way to make sure that the needs of our children and our residents are met.

993
01:14:45,276 --> 01:14:49,559
And I wish you and Maxine well in your retirement, and don't be a stranger.

994
01:14:49,939 --> 01:14:50,260
Thank you.

995
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,240
Thank you very much.

01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:52,841

Mustone.

998
01:14:54,373 --> 01:14:56,734
I want to congratulate you and wish you well.

999
01:14:56,915 --> 01:14:59,616
And when you are officially retired, we'll go out for a Guinness.

1000
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:04,599
Go to the food bank.

1001
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,320

1002
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,361
Thank you.

1003
01:15:09,862 --> 01:15:12,704
So Roy, I've learned a tremendous amount from you.

1004
01:15:13,484 --> 01:15:19,308
And I've watched blue and white run through your veins.

1005
01:15:20,188 --> 01:15:22,592
Because I know you'll never bleed red.

1006
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:24,255
It will always be blue and white.

1007
01:15:24,455 --> 01:15:25,577
You are a Mustang.

1008
01:15:26,198 --> 01:15:27,921
You'll always be here.

1009
01:15:28,201 --> 01:15:32,849
Even when you retire, I know if I call you, you're answering that cell phone.

1010
01:15:34,074 --> 01:15:39,318
And that's because you're one of the most dedicated men I have ever met in my life.

1011
01:15:39,999 --> 01:15:43,181
And your service has been phenomenal.

1012
01:15:43,621 --> 01:15:44,562
And I wish you well.

1013
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:50,446
And I'm so glad that you're leaving at a high in your career and leaving us in such great shape.

1014
01:15:50,887 --> 01:15:56,731
You worked very, very hard to put us where we are now and help us through the hard days.

1015
01:15:58,192 --> 01:16:00,614
And I wish you well finding a hobby.

1016
01:16:01,975 --> 01:16:05,959
And not driving Maxine crazy And good luck.

1017
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:06,539
Thank you.

1018
01:16:06,559 --> 01:16:07,300
Appreciate it.
