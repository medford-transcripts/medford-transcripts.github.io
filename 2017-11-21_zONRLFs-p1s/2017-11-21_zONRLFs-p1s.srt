1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:09,387
[SPEAKER_13]: and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

2
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:14,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Approval of the minutes of the October 16, 2017 meeting.

3
00:00:15,732 --> 00:00:18,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval by Mrs. Van der Kloot, seconded by Mr. Skerry.

4
00:00:18,975 --> 00:00:19,695
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

5
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:20,396
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

6
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:21,137
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

7
00:00:21,697 --> 00:00:22,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

8
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:24,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry.

10
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:27,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

11
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:28,362
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

12
00:00:32,077 --> 00:00:34,399
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, these are your student activity accounts.

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,902
[SPEAKER_11]: These are all student activities.

14
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:03,018
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, anything with the first three digits of 890 is your student activity accounts.

15
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:46,389
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a revolving account, so that is within one of the production areas.

16
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,855
[SPEAKER_09]: The production areas for revolving accounts, it's not the general fund, so it'd be one of the ancillary accounts.

17
00:01:55,275 --> 00:02:00,237
And then my last question is on page 28 of 36.

18
00:02:00,377 --> 00:02:07,900
It says the vendor name is Secret 21, and it's $200 in the account for the school.

19
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:13,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, could you repeat the?

20
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:15,183
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, page 28 of 36.

21
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:20,045
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the eighth line item down.

22
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:23,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Teachers 21?

23
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:34,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's a contract that we have for service provided through an internet provision for professional development and instruction.

24
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:46,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, that's through a grant, so the grant descriptions are not as extensive.

25
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:47,356
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

26
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:52,379
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

27
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,300
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

28
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,741
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

30
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:55,601
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

31
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:57,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Approval of payrolls.

32
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:00,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion for approval by Mr. Skerry, seconded by Ms.

33
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:00,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Kreatz.

34
00:03:01,506 --> 00:03:02,286
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

35
00:03:02,306 --> 00:03:02,366
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

36
00:03:03,027 --> 00:03:03,687
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

37
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:04,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

38
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:05,788
[SPEAKER_13]: Report of secretary.

39
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:07,350
[SPEAKER_13]: None.

40
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Report of committees.

41
00:03:10,512 --> 00:03:10,632
[SPEAKER_13]: None.

42
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:16,828
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to share a note.

43
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:16,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

44
00:03:16,928 --> 00:03:17,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Fritz.

45
00:03:17,548 --> 00:03:17,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

46
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:22,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I stopped by the library a couple weeks ago, and I have some cool news.

47
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:28,270
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not sure if everybody's seen it, but at the library, there's a new electronic sign-in iPad.

48
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:36,911
[SPEAKER_06]: And so far, what the students do is they can sign in, and they can track how many students are in the library throughout the day.

49
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:41,952
[SPEAKER_06]: And it electronically goes into a data, like a Google spreadsheet,

50
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:53,687
[SPEAKER_06]: And they can quickly run reports and send it to the headmaster, principals, and they can give the total number of students that are in the library at any point in time.

51
00:03:55,028 --> 00:03:57,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just a great resource.

52
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,093
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to share that news with everybody.

53
00:04:01,393 --> 00:04:02,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Ms.

54
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:02,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Gretz.

55
00:04:03,655 --> 00:04:03,815
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

56
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:05,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Mustone, motion for suspension?

57
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:05,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

58
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:09,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Could I make a motion to suspend the rules to hear the report out of order of project 351?

59
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:13,420
[SPEAKER_13]: This motion on the floor for suspension of rules, all seconded by Ms.

60
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Van der Kloot.

61
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,621
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

62
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:15,801
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

63
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:16,842
[SPEAKER_13]: Suspension is granted.

64
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:18,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on project 351.

65
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:20,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent?

66
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:36,134
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor and members of the school committee, as you know, project 351 was started by Governor Patrick.

67
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:39,456
[SPEAKER_17]: It was an attempt to provide leaders who

68
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:44,426
[SPEAKER_17]: come from our middle schools, and they would do community service.

69
00:04:44,486 --> 00:04:52,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, we've done this for a number of years, and this evening, we have two representatives, one from the McGlynn and one from the Andrews.

70
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:58,409
[SPEAKER_17]: And right now, we'll call upon our principal, Paul DeLeva, to introduce the person from the Andrews.

71
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:00,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Would you like to step up here so you can go?

72
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,750
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, OK.

73
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:04,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on up.

74
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:04,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

75
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:05,331
[SPEAKER_13]: Heineck.

76
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,732
[SPEAKER_14]: This is really nice.

77
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:15,829
[SPEAKER_13]: Either one.

78
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:16,710
[SPEAKER_01]: Either one is fine.

79
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,571
[SPEAKER_01]: So, good evening members of the school committee.

80
00:05:21,532 --> 00:05:24,233
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, every year we participate in Project 351.

81
00:05:24,313 --> 00:05:37,418
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great project that has been done with the Andrews and the McGlynn, having representatives to develop leaders as well as come up with community service projects for our school individually.

82
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:42,600
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, they meet on Mata Lutha King Day as a big group.

83
00:05:43,348 --> 00:05:48,831
[SPEAKER_01]: And they develop their projects through discussions with everybody, through the school.

84
00:05:49,831 --> 00:05:57,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to welcome Ava Heinegg, who is the daughter of Max Heinegg, who is also a school teacher at the Medford High School.

85
00:05:58,015 --> 00:06:05,078
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mr. Heinegg and I share a little bit of camaraderie, because we were both at the Brooks Hobs at one point together on the same team.

86
00:06:05,238 --> 00:06:08,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So it comes to full circle that his daughter

87
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,418
[SPEAKER_01]: is being represented for Project 351.

88
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:14,059
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to introduce Ava Heinegg.

89
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

90
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:29,665
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so I would like to start by saying what an honor it is to represent the Andrews Middle School.

91
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:38,508
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a vital opportunity for me, and I'm so thankful to be given a chance to be part of something that could be so beneficial to our community.

92
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:45,833
[SPEAKER_00]: To meet other kids and be able to converse and share ideas that could impact people in need is such an amazing thing.

93
00:06:46,414 --> 00:06:51,878
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so proud to represent Medford because it has been such a large part of my life.

94
00:06:52,458 --> 00:07:07,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing town soccer, volunteering at the library and farmer's market, attending public school here, and dancing at a local studio, O'Cheryl A. Sullivan's, and even doing school plays and Builders Club, that's a community service club,

95
00:07:08,402 --> 00:07:09,883
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Andrews.

96
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:17,249
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would like to thank you for the opportunity to be a part of Project 351.

97
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,751
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

98
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:33,603
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to mention she's joined by her mom, Wendy, and her sister, Stella, who are here.

99
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:35,625
[SPEAKER_13]: And Wendy's a teacher as well.

100
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:42,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Any questions?

101
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:45,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Miss Cugno.

102
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:47,805
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, congratulations, Eva.

103
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:48,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

104
00:07:49,706 --> 00:07:56,628
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually participated in that a few years back, and it was just an amazing, amazing day.

105
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:08,713
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not involved with it, unfortunately, and we didn't know about it, but I had the opportunity to go down and to see students from all over the state really working together, and what a camaraderie.

106
00:08:09,513 --> 00:08:20,403
[SPEAKER_07]: for students that really didn't know each other at the beginning of the day to really become very friendly by the end of the day and they were all working really for the cause of a larger community.

107
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:30,152
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean it's just amazing and I want to thank you and I also want to thank the other student for representing Medford so well but I have a question for you and that is what is it that you did?

108
00:08:31,574 --> 00:08:32,174
[SPEAKER_00]: That I did?

109
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:32,735
[SPEAKER_07]: That day.

110
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:34,563
[SPEAKER_01]: But she hasn't.

111
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:35,504
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gone yet.

112
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:36,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you haven't gone yet?

113
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:36,605
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

114
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:37,306
[SPEAKER_00]: She hasn't gone yet.

115
00:08:37,406 --> 00:08:39,267
[SPEAKER_00]: What did I think about the Luther King Day?

116
00:08:39,628 --> 00:08:40,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.

117
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:40,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I am sorry.

118
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:42,630
[SPEAKER_07]: So come back and let us know what you did.

119
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:43,251
[SPEAKER_07]: I will.

120
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:44,912
[SPEAKER_07]: But congratulations.

121
00:08:44,972 --> 00:08:45,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

122
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:47,734
[SPEAKER_13]: For some reason, I thought everyone went by.

123
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:49,676
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

124
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:50,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

125
00:08:59,612 --> 00:09:06,795
[SPEAKER_13]: We also want to announce that Sumaya Omi, I don't know if she's present this evening, she's not here from the McGlynn Middle School.

126
00:09:07,876 --> 00:09:11,758
[SPEAKER_13]: We send her our regards as well and we hope to see her after Martin Luther King Day as well.

127
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:26,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion on the floor to revert to the regular business by Miss Quinn must own all those in favor.

128
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:28,354
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed.

129
00:09:29,034 --> 00:09:30,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to accept the report in place on file.

130
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:31,897
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor.

131
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:33,719
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed.

132
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

133
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:36,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Community participation.

134
00:09:37,062 --> 00:09:39,344
[SPEAKER_13]: Melanie McLaughlin CPAC update.

135
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:41,546
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Benedetto.

136
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:45,656
[SPEAKER_10]: I got an email from Melanie right before our meeting.

137
00:09:46,076 --> 00:09:50,398
[SPEAKER_10]: She's homesick, and she would have to cancel for this evening and postpone.

138
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:53,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion to table her request for participation?

139
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:53,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

140
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:55,081
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion.

141
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:55,801
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

142
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:56,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

143
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:57,182
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

144
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:57,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

145
00:09:59,323 --> 00:09:59,944
[SPEAKER_13]: Miss Mustone.

146
00:10:00,264 --> 00:10:07,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I am aware that the McGlynn School has requested to be part of the community participation program, but it's not listed.

147
00:10:07,248 --> 00:10:10,730
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was wondering if that's something that we could get from.

148
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,776
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there someone from the McGlynn that wanted to come up and speak?

149
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:14,856
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

150
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:20,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

151
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:21,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

152
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:25,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

153
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:31,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Shalene Douglas, president of the Medford Teacher Association, 414 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

154
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:37,462
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I'm having candy because I had garlic at dinner.

155
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:38,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

156
00:10:39,536 --> 00:10:44,919
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate having the meeting with you and the superintendent to discuss the middle school action plan.

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Roy, I did receive your email today with a date of December 6th for us to move forward on this.

158
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:55,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I will poll the teachers to see if this date works.

159
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:57,986
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it does work, we will have that meeting.

160
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:06,131
[SPEAKER_03]: We assume that you and the school committee members will meet us at the McGlynn Middle School on that day if it's approved.

161
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:19,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I also, as promised to Mr. Belson, have the binders illustrating our concerns regarding the original plan, and I would like to share those with you tonight.

162
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:28,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to ask Ryan McCarthy and Brian Villard to give those to you now, so you'll have time to look those over prior to our meeting on the 6th.

163
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:43,303
[SPEAKER_03]: They're color-coded.

164
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:44,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Very teacher.

165
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:46,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Very teacher oriented.

166
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:57,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

167
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:00,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

168
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:03,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And one to Mr. Belson and one to the mayor.

169
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:03,559
No, no, no.

170
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:04,059
[SPEAKER_03]: We have none?

171
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,121
[SPEAKER_03]: I can read it.

172
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:06,421
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

173
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:07,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Did Mr. Belson get one?

174
00:12:07,402 --> 00:12:07,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

175
00:12:07,762 --> 00:12:08,423
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, we're all set.

176
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:08,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

177
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:09,163
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

178
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:09,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

179
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:10,084
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't.

180
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:10,224
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

181
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:11,405
I don't know.

182
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:13,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

183
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:14,348
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up to you.

184
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:15,488
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he needs it though.

185
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:17,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

186
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:18,850
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

187
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,051
[SPEAKER_03]: So lastly, our members are here tonight to show support for the grievances.

188
00:12:23,091 --> 00:12:24,132
[SPEAKER_03]: You were here late tonight.

189
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:30,935
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to ask all those teachers here to support the grievances to please stand.

190
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:38,158
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank you for your solidarity.

191
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:41,341
[SPEAKER_03]: and to let you know these people are here in support of these grievances.

192
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:42,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thank you for your time.

193
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:58,392
[SPEAKER_13]: Report of Superintendent.

194
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Recommendation to appoint Dr. Patrick Sabia as School Physician.

195
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:02,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

196
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:08,038
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor and members of the School Committee, I'm going to call upon Tony Vento, our Health Supervisor, to introduce Dr. Patrick Sabia.

197
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Kristen Goodell has taken a position at Boston University.

198
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:16,343
[SPEAKER_17]: as a dean, and she's done a great job for us.

199
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:19,145
[SPEAKER_17]: And Dr. Sabia is going to do a great job for us.

200
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:21,846
[SPEAKER_17]: We met the other day, and we're really excited to have him on board.

201
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:27,070
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm going to let Tony introduce him and let Dr. Sabia make a few remarks and answer any questions you may have.

202
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:29,451
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

203
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:33,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to introduce Dr. Patrick Sabia as our new school physician.

204
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:37,537
[SPEAKER_05]: He practices in Medford with Medford Family Care.

205
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:41,599
[SPEAKER_05]: He's had over 25 years of practice.

206
00:13:42,872 --> 00:13:51,219
[SPEAKER_05]: in many community health centers, including Cambridge Health Alliance and the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center, and also out at Metro West Medical Center.

207
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,704
[SPEAKER_05]: He's on the Tufts faculty, teaching family medicine residents.

208
00:13:57,485 --> 00:14:03,850
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been a member of different quality improvement committees while at Cambridge Health Alliance and was director of

209
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:05,237
[SPEAKER_05]: obstetrics.

210
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:15,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're very excited to have him follow the good steps of Dr. Goodell, and we appreciate her good service, and we look forward to working with Dr. Savia.

211
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

212
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:17,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome.

213
00:14:18,203 --> 00:14:18,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

214
00:14:18,383 --> 00:14:18,883
[SPEAKER_13]: Van der Kloot.

215
00:14:19,704 --> 00:14:20,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Approval?

216
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:22,725
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion on the floor for approval, seconded by Ms.

217
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:23,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Disceri.

218
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:24,666
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

219
00:14:25,106 --> 00:14:25,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

220
00:14:25,686 --> 00:14:26,027
[SPEAKER_13]: A roll call?

221
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,567
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

222
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:27,887
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

223
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Excuse me, I believe Ms.

224
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:29,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Van der Kloot.

225
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:30,088
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry.

226
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:30,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call?

227
00:14:30,789 --> 00:14:30,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

228
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:33,830
[SPEAKER_11]: What kind of needs do we usually call

229
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:36,339
[SPEAKER_10]: are on, just so people understand.

230
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:45,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the doctors will sit on our school health advisory committee, where we discuss different health and wellness issues.

231
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:49,091
[SPEAKER_05]: We make plans for different initiatives.

232
00:14:49,152 --> 00:14:54,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the initiatives we have done have been different health policies.

233
00:14:55,518 --> 00:15:02,248
[SPEAKER_05]: setting up parent education forums, getting the SBIRT screening going, NARCAN training.

234
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:06,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So we always, you know, we consult with the school physician on that.

235
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:16,457
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll also consult with our athletic trainer and review the concussion and injury, athletic injury reports on a season-by-season basis.

236
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:18,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.

237
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:30,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if a case came up that, like the tuberculosis outbreak that we had last year, that exposure, we consulted with Dr. Goodell on how to move through and handle that.

238
00:15:33,425 --> 00:15:39,349
[SPEAKER_05]: type of health concern that we feel we just want support and consultation on.

239
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I can reach out to him.

240
00:15:41,171 --> 00:15:41,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

241
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:41,931
[SPEAKER_13]: Good.

242
00:15:42,512 --> 00:15:43,432
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a pleasure to meet you.

243
00:15:43,613 --> 00:15:43,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

244
00:15:44,673 --> 00:15:45,574
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call vote.

245
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:46,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

246
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:48,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

247
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:53,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

248
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,781
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

249
00:15:54,801 --> 00:15:56,042
[SPEAKER_13]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

250
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:56,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

251
00:15:57,242 --> 00:15:57,843
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

252
00:15:57,863 --> 00:15:58,103
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

253
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:09,956
[SPEAKER_13]: Item 3, report on tier 2 E-rate funding award.

254
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:10,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

255
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:20,830
[SPEAKER_17]: So this particular report is letting you know that the federal government has now approved our E-rate tier 2 funding, which is a substantial amount of money.

256
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:22,532
[SPEAKER_17]: It needs to be matched.

257
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:28,909
[SPEAKER_17]: If it's approved here this evening that will go forward, I'll go to the City Council at a future date to ask for the matching funds.

258
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:39,031
[SPEAKER_17]: It will allow us to expand our infrastructure to support our networks, to increase our switches and all the other aspects of the infrastructure that supports technology.

259
00:16:40,092 --> 00:16:45,373
[SPEAKER_17]: Kirstine Patterson is a lead person locally on this and she's going to tell you a little bit more about it.

260
00:16:49,753 --> 00:16:51,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, thank you, members of the committee.

261
00:16:51,114 --> 00:16:58,359
[SPEAKER_09]: This is very exciting news for us, as not all school districts that request the Category 2 funding receive it.

262
00:16:58,459 --> 00:16:59,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is very significant.

263
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:10,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Within the three categories that we applied for funding, we received funding for the firewalls in the amount of $17,015.

264
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,028
[SPEAKER_09]: For wireless internet connectivity, we received $101,649.

265
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:27,609
[SPEAKER_09]: And within the switches and the internal connections, we received $265,186 from the federal match.

266
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:35,652
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is very significant with 60% of the overall project cost being funded by the federal government.

267
00:17:36,172 --> 00:17:44,835
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are hopeful to receive the approval to move forward and request the city side match for this very important

268
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:50,811
[SPEAKER_09]: infrastructure improvement that will help all of our schools, school buildings as well.

269
00:17:52,333 --> 00:18:00,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, the coordination scheduling still needs to be taken into consideration as this is a very extensive project.

270
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:11,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Even with the approvals, we would not be able to actually begin the work until toward the end of June of 2018.

271
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:14,471
[SPEAKER_09]: So this would be likely a summer project

272
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:20,601
[SPEAKER_09]: So that has the least impact on instruction and the school day.

273
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you say work will begin in 2017 or 18?

274
00:18:22,743 --> 00:18:23,904
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, 18.

275
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:24,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

276
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:25,485
[SPEAKER_09]: So June of 18.

277
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:26,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

278
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:29,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we have to get the funding in line now.

279
00:18:29,148 --> 00:18:32,391
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to provide the approval for a city side match.

280
00:18:32,772 --> 00:18:37,656
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we engage the contractor, issue the purchase orders, and then start the scheduling out.

281
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:52,558
[SPEAKER_09]: but because of the massive amounts of infrastructure and the downtime that that would create, we don't want to actually begin that until we have enough time where we don't have instruction going on in critical moments.

282
00:18:52,598 --> 00:19:03,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there could be some that would be attempted to be done during the school vacation weeks, but the majority, the major switches in those components would be done likely in July of 2018.

283
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,621
[SPEAKER_19]: Miss Van der Kloot.

284
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:14,586
[SPEAKER_19]: So is this then do we need to go before the City Council to ask for this match?

285
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:14,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

286
00:19:14,966 --> 00:19:15,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we do.

287
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:15,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

288
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:20,790
[SPEAKER_19]: And would this be part of a capital improvement plan or would this be a standalone item?

289
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,231
[SPEAKER_13]: I would anticipate a free cash vote.

290
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:23,292
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

291
00:19:23,592 --> 00:19:25,874
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we need to move on this relatively quickly.

292
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:27,215
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to vote tonight so that we can.

293
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:27,675
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

294
00:19:27,715 --> 00:19:33,880
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd make a motion for approval because obviously anything that we can do to improve our infrastructure

295
00:19:34,387 --> 00:19:35,909
[SPEAKER_19]: is absolutely worth doing.

296
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,817
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I make a motion to approve and to send this forward to the city council for their approval.

297
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:42,878
[SPEAKER_13]: For the matching amount of $291,150.

298
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:43,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

299
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:44,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a second on this motion?

300
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:44,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Second.

301
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:52,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

302
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,094
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

303
00:19:53,114 --> 00:20:15,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so through you to the superintendent, if you need a school committee members to go with you, um, to the city council to ask for matching funds, um, I'm offering to be available and, uh, stand with you because, um, technology is so important and especially, um, all the firewall and all the protective things.

304
00:20:16,102 --> 00:20:17,383
[SPEAKER_10]: We just really need this.

305
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:20,470
[SPEAKER_10]: And we need to keep growing with technology.

306
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,111
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sure that they'll agree.

307
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:26,156
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you would like any help going forward, just let me know.

308
00:20:26,576 --> 00:20:26,916
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

309
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:27,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

310
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:29,599
[SPEAKER_17]: Pardon me.

311
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:34,885
[SPEAKER_17]: I worked it out the date with the mayor and based on what's on their calendar.

312
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:40,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

313
00:20:40,712 --> 00:20:44,793
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion on the floor, seconded by Mr. Skerry and Mr. Benedetto.

314
00:20:44,813 --> 00:20:45,773
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote, please.

315
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:49,414
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

316
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:54,736
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

317
00:20:55,116 --> 00:20:55,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

318
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:57,056
[SPEAKER_13]: 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

319
00:20:57,096 --> 00:20:57,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

320
00:20:58,417 --> 00:20:59,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much for that.

321
00:21:01,297 --> 00:21:02,898
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on Veterans Day program.

322
00:21:03,772 --> 00:21:11,298
[SPEAKER_17]: So every year we have a Veterans Day program, and Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli is the coordinator, and she's going to come up and tell you about the program.

323
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:19,004
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

324
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:22,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Burke, Superintendent Belson, and members of the Medford School Committee.

325
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:29,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight I'm here to report on a longstanding tradition on the secondary level in the Medford Public Schools.

326
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:35,204
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my favorite events, and this year was no exception.

327
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:54,555
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Medford Public Schools and the Office of Veteran Services here at Medford City Hall have teamed up over the course of the past 17 years to provide students and faculty on the high school level the opportunity to learn about combat and non-combat related experience of our city's veterans.

328
00:21:55,155 --> 00:21:58,657
[SPEAKER_04]: And from all accounts, this program has been enormously successful.

329
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:09,183
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been fulfilling not only to our students, but also to the adults, the teachers and administrators who have seen the speeches that these veterans give.

330
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:17,829
[SPEAKER_04]: This year's program occurred on Thursday, November 2nd, and was co-coordinated with the Director of Veterans Services, Ernest Lindsey.

331
00:22:18,458 --> 00:22:22,841
[SPEAKER_04]: The day began early in the morning before period one in the superintendent's conference room.

332
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,463
[SPEAKER_04]: We were treated to a light breakfast.

333
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:33,169
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor, Mayor Burke, did attend this, as did school committee member Kathy Kreatz.

334
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:44,378
[SPEAKER_04]: They greeted the veteran speakers, and we all participated in the welcoming address, which included the Pledge of Allegiance and a brief introduction by each of the participants.

335
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:57,811
[SPEAKER_04]: This year, 27 veterans from several eras, including the Vietnam War, the Persian Gulf War, and the Iraq War, visited 38 classes and gave an overview of their experiences and contributions.

336
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:04,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, though, this year we did not have any World War II veterans or Korean era veterans.

337
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:12,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Over the time that I have been organizing this event, each year you get fewer and fewer members from those eras.

338
00:23:14,455 --> 00:23:21,702
[SPEAKER_04]: The program provides our students with an oral history of personal experiences that enhances their study of history in the classroom.

339
00:23:22,423 --> 00:23:28,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Feedback from students, teachers, and veterans from this year's program has been overwhelmingly positive.

340
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:36,877
[SPEAKER_04]: We are thankful to Dunkin' Donuts and West Medford for donating coffee and a generous assortment of treats for breakfast.

341
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:40,289
[SPEAKER_04]: They've done so for the past, I believe, 17 years.

342
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,011
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really want to shout out to Dunkin' Donuts and West Medford.

343
00:23:43,711 --> 00:24:01,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Would also like to thank Grade 12 Medford Vocational Technical High School student Noah Kreatz for displaying many items from his vintage military collection and engaging our guests in meaningful conversations about the importance of historical artifacts and understanding our nation's history.

344
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:06,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, one of the proudest things that I think we offer is this program.

345
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,899
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am thrilled that we are 17 years strong into it.

346
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:12,184
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to take any questions.

347
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:13,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Great program.

348
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:14,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

349
00:24:19,986 --> 00:24:20,766
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on?

350
00:24:20,806 --> 00:24:22,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, for Miss Riccadeli.

351
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:25,268
[SPEAKER_07]: It's OK.

352
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:26,088
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.

353
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:31,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, my question is, well, first of all, I just want to say thank you to all the veterans that come each and every year.

354
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:35,112
[SPEAKER_07]: As you said, it's been a 17-year program that you've been running.

355
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:39,053
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been fabulous, because I know the students get a lot out of it, just as much as the veterans do.

356
00:24:39,973 --> 00:24:43,455
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, a thank you, if we can, send a letter to Mr. Lindsay.

357
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:48,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's the director of the veterans just to just as it as a thank-you note from us?

358
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:53,899
[SPEAKER_07]: But the other thing is is that you were speaking of we don't have the veterans anymore from certain errors.

359
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it possible?

360
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:10,587
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know this is just to throw it out there, but Maybe invite like children of the veterans from that era that have heard the stories that still have stories to share and just give an insight to our students from that era and

361
00:25:11,582 --> 00:25:13,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a great suggestion.

362
00:25:13,343 --> 00:25:20,525
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a 96-year-old uncle who was in World War II, went down in two ships, used to live in Ninetyside and Riverside Ave.

363
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:33,190
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been trying to get him to come because he tells a great story, but he really is just very shy and gets very emotional at the stories that he shares with his closest family.

364
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:35,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a wonderful suggestion.

365
00:25:35,249 --> 00:25:36,489
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly will work on it.

366
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:42,311
[SPEAKER_04]: As I think about, even though I know his stories, I certainly could not do them the justice that he would.

367
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:44,211
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I think it's a great suggestion.

368
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:45,852
[SPEAKER_04]: If I could just say one other thing.

369
00:25:46,232 --> 00:25:49,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Nicole Chiesa, Dr. Nicole Chiesa is the Director of Humanities

370
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:55,240
[SPEAKER_04]: So in her absence, she's still on a leave of absence, I stepped in this year.

371
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,523
[SPEAKER_04]: So I believe not this year, but the prior three years, Nicole did organize it with Nick Cain.

372
00:26:00,583 --> 00:26:04,565
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want it to be misleading that I've been doing this for 17 years.

373
00:26:04,685 --> 00:26:08,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly there have been several of us in the process over those 17 years.

374
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:10,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

375
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:12,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're welcome.

376
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:19,307
[SPEAKER_07]: And also a letter to Mr. Kreatz, who Noah's been an amazing asset to a lot of these programs.

377
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:26,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And his enthusiasm and his experience, even though he hasn't, thankfully, gone, but he does have a lot of knowledge.

378
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:30,555
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really nice to see a young student who shares that.

379
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:31,336
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

380
00:26:31,836 --> 00:26:32,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

381
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:32,737
[SPEAKER_10]: DiBenedetto.

382
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

383
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:39,542
[SPEAKER_10]: So given that your uncle's shy and that you'd love him to come, but he's not capable of

384
00:26:39,993 --> 00:26:44,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Can't you video him telling his story and bring it forward that way?

385
00:26:44,416 --> 00:26:46,837
[SPEAKER_10]: I've suggested that to him.

386
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:48,818
[SPEAKER_10]: Just on your phone, even?

387
00:26:48,838 --> 00:26:51,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Because then you can transfer it.

388
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,701
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the technology up there now.

389
00:26:54,221 --> 00:26:57,383
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe just even your conversation with him.

390
00:26:57,944 --> 00:26:59,885
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it might impact.

391
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:04,425
[SPEAKER_10]: greatly and it might be something that your family will always charge her as well.

392
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:08,711
[SPEAKER_10]: And my second thing is, could you send a thank you note to the Dunkin Donuts as well?

393
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:13,416
[SPEAKER_10]: 17 years of providing food for all of them.

394
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:17,882
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, at 20 years we should have them come in and, you know,

395
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:20,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Give him a golden donut.

396
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:21,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Give him some donuts?

397
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:24,420
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll give him some donuts.

398
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:29,967
[SPEAKER_13]: On the paper, as amended, that thank yous be sent out to the respective parties.

399
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:30,868
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

400
00:27:30,888 --> 00:27:31,469
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

401
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:32,209
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

402
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

403
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:33,972
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

404
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:35,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.

405
00:27:35,674 --> 00:27:37,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say thank you also.

406
00:27:38,643 --> 00:27:45,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say thank you to all the veterans for coming out to discuss their experiences with the students.

407
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:50,906
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to give a very special thanks to Ernst Lindsey, Bernadette Riccadeli for organizing the program.

408
00:27:51,526 --> 00:27:55,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to share a mention from Noah.

409
00:27:55,427 --> 00:27:58,868
[SPEAKER_06]: And he said he really, really enjoys doing this program.

410
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:01,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a pleasure going to all the veterans programs.

411
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:05,730
[SPEAKER_06]: He also went to the VFW program, and he showed

412
00:28:06,086 --> 00:28:11,390
[SPEAKER_06]: his collection with the Cub Scouts, Webelos, and the veterans that attended that program.

413
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,954
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just something, his passion, that he really likes to do, and he wished he could be here tonight, but he has work.

414
00:28:16,354 --> 00:28:17,856
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to share that with everybody.

415
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:18,977
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

416
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:20,077
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

417
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:20,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Kreatz.

418
00:28:22,812 --> 00:28:29,222
[SPEAKER_13]: Recommendation to accept major gift from stop and shop to vocational school and food service program, Mr. Superintendent.

419
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:32,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, Mayor and members of the school committee, tonight we're going to prove there is such a thing as a free lunch.

420
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,594
[SPEAKER_17]: So Kirsten is going to cover that for us.

421
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:43,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, if I could have it noted, the director of finance is bringing you money this evening.

422
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:58,017
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we're very excited to present that our local stop and shop has generously given the intended donation of $10,000 to the new vocational Bistro 489.

423
00:28:59,497 --> 00:29:07,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And they are also going to fund one full day of lunch for the entire district, which is the equivalent of $7,500.

424
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:12,205
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're very excited.

425
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:18,810
[SPEAKER_13]: We need a roll call.

426
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion to accept this gift?

427
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:22,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to accept by Mr. Skerry.

428
00:29:23,353 --> 00:29:24,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Ms.

429
00:29:24,934 --> 00:29:25,114
[SPEAKER_13]: Cunha.

430
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:25,594
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a question?

431
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:32,794
[SPEAKER_19]: So my question was, it's a wonderful thing.

432
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:42,196
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sure we're going to be very conscientious of making sure that we have lunches for all kids, no matter what their allergies might be or something like that.

433
00:29:42,216 --> 00:29:42,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

434
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,197
[SPEAKER_09]: That's always a consideration on every menu.

435
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:45,717
[SPEAKER_19]: OK.

436
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:48,318
[SPEAKER_19]: And the second question I had to do had to do with

437
00:29:49,218 --> 00:29:56,862
[SPEAKER_19]: In the report, it said, as discussed, signs signifying Stop and Shop's donation will be placed inside the bistro, and we will receive content, i.e.

438
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,543
[SPEAKER_19]: photos, for marketing and media relations purposes.

439
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:07,727
[SPEAKER_19]: So I just wondered what exactly the, I could certainly see other people approaching other

440
00:30:09,122 --> 00:30:12,644
[SPEAKER_19]: food stores for donations as well or for assistance.

441
00:30:13,184 --> 00:30:22,708
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I just want to make sure that because Stop and Shop has their sign that it is open to other perhaps generous givers in the future.

442
00:30:23,168 --> 00:30:23,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

443
00:30:23,728 --> 00:30:34,473
[SPEAKER_09]: And in our discussions, we indicated, you know, the possibility of some, you know, nominal size plaque recognizing their generous donation at the startup of the program.

444
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:41,982
[SPEAKER_09]: does not preclude anyone else any other significant donations and subsequent plaques and acknowledgment.

445
00:30:42,222 --> 00:30:43,223
[SPEAKER_19]: OK, thank you, Chris.

446
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:45,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

447
00:30:45,324 --> 00:30:46,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

448
00:30:46,565 --> 00:30:48,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to know how we're spending the $10,000.

449
00:30:51,488 --> 00:30:55,431
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't gotten it yet, so I don't want to spend it until we've actually received it.

450
00:30:55,571 --> 00:30:57,332
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, but what's the plan?

451
00:30:57,352 --> 00:30:59,033
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's going to the deck.

452
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:00,194
[SPEAKER_10]: The deck?

453
00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:03,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's for a physical piece, not to stock with.

454
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:06,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we're going to have to stock the kitchen at some point.

455
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:09,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it'll be stocked.

456
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:09,597
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

457
00:31:10,677 --> 00:31:15,000
[SPEAKER_17]: The donation of the deck appears to be what's ticketed for.

458
00:31:15,621 --> 00:31:15,961
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

459
00:31:16,461 --> 00:31:16,862

479
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:04,864
[SPEAKER_17]: We talked about them at our committee of the hall, so Rita is here.

480
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:09,106
[SPEAKER_17]: First of all, let me congratulate Rita publicly for her award from

481
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:17,730
[SPEAKER_17]: the Italian Association for her outstanding work as an Italian teacher and administrator promoting programs in Italian culture.

482
00:32:18,331 --> 00:32:18,953
[SPEAKER_17]: The other reason.

483
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:20,416
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

484
00:32:25,255 --> 00:32:37,506
[SPEAKER_17]: The other evening, Friday evening, at the Dry Dock, the Innovation Center, Rita was there receiving audits from a whole pile of people who were involved in Italian culture, including the Consul General.

485
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:41,630
[SPEAKER_17]: And Rita deserves all the work, all the credit that she gets.

486
00:32:42,191 --> 00:32:42,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

487
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,060
[SPEAKER_02]: So good evening.

488
00:32:53,361 --> 00:33:03,207
[SPEAKER_02]: As the superintendent said, the two items that have to do with me on the agenda were brought up last week at the committee of the whole.

489
00:33:03,787 --> 00:33:12,333
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one is asking your approval for the New York trip for December 17 and 18.

490
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:18,477
[SPEAKER_02]: The 17th is a Sunday, so students would only be missing one day of school.

491
00:33:19,728 --> 00:33:28,152
[SPEAKER_02]: This field trip is offered only to the AP Italian students of Miss Canetta's class, and it's only 10 students.

492
00:33:29,752 --> 00:33:36,956
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a unit on the opera, and they really fell in love with the opera, and they went to see an opera in Boston.

493
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:41,818
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as a follow-up activity, they Skyped with an opera singer.

494
00:33:42,805 --> 00:33:50,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And she revealed that she's going to be singing at Carnegie Hall on the evening of the 17th, and students really wanted to go see her.

495
00:33:52,911 --> 00:34:09,580
[SPEAKER_02]: The program for the 17th is on a rediscovered Italian composer, opera composer, and so they're going to be dedicating the evening to this composer, Aldo Finzi.

496
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:30,887
[SPEAKER_02]: The opera singer, whose name is Elizabeth Herzenberg, sent the poetry of the songs that she's gonna be singing, of course in Italian, to the students, and they are studying that poetry in class, so it'll be a really meaningful field trip for them.

497
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:40,551
[SPEAKER_02]: We received $3,000 scholarship, or $3,000 from the Michelina Pietrangelo Scholarship Fund

498
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,411
[SPEAKER_02]: to cover the expenses.

499
00:34:42,571 --> 00:34:46,252
[SPEAKER_02]: So it said no cost to students.

500
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,313
[SPEAKER_02]: The $3,000 covers everything.

501
00:34:49,193 --> 00:34:54,336
[SPEAKER_02]: The bus, the concert, the hotel, and everything.

502

[SPEAKER_02]: Caneto and I will serve as chaperones, and we will be traveling to New York by bus, attend the concert that Sunday evening, and return to Medford the next day.

504
00:35:17,153 --> 00:35:18,614
[SPEAKER_19]: I just had a question about the bus.

505
00:35:19,054 --> 00:35:24,838
[SPEAKER_19]: Is this a Bus that a private bus for these no, it's not a private bus.

506
00:35:24,978 --> 00:35:30,963
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mega bus leaves from South Station and Goes right, right.

507
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:35,146
[SPEAKER_19]: I figured for the price it had to be but I just want yes I hope you guys have a wonderful time.

549

[SPEAKER_15]: Translate a little bit?

550
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:42,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

551
00:37:42,487 --> 00:37:44,889
[SPEAKER_15]: Sandra said that she's very happy to be studying Italian.

552
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:47,651
[SPEAKER_15]: She loves Italian and she hopes to continue.

553
00:38:03,222 --> 00:38:05,143

00:38:05,403 --> 00:38:07,264
[SPEAKER_02]: She thanked me, I don't know why.

555
00:38:07,844 --> 00:38:13,087
[SPEAKER_02]: But her teacher, her AP teacher, and also her middle school teacher, who's here, Ms.

556
00:38:13,107 --> 00:38:13,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonacorsi.

557
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:14,648

00:38:15,348 --> 00:38:21,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, congratulations.

559
00:38:21,752 --> 00:38:22,412
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

560
00:38:44,386 --> 00:38:45,607
[SPEAKER_13]: You should have translated it.

561
00:38:47,689 --> 00:39:00,620
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually there was one part that Mr. Carlo has missed and that is Sandra also said that she does speak Spanish and because she had the opportunity of taking Italian.

562
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,902
[SPEAKER_07]: that she fell in love with the language and the culture.

563
00:39:04,422 --> 00:39:16,989
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's an important piece, because no matter how many languages we speak as a district, when we have the opportunity, and here I have to say thank you to Cassett, because Cassett is where it starts in the elementary schools.

564
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:28,795
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and it continues through the middle schools, and it continues to the high school, and it's a great opportunity for Cassett, but also a great opportunity for us, and to thank all the teachers that have always been involved, so thank you.

565
00:39:35,227 --> 00:39:39,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford High School student representative, Justin Tseng, would like to say a few words.

566
00:39:39,931 --> 00:39:52,721
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to reinforce what we just said in that students at Medford High are so, we're so dedicated to learning and a bunch of us are so dedicated to learning foreign languages.

567
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:59,607
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wanted to say to Carlo, we don't say thank you enough for all that you've done for us.

568
00:39:59,747 --> 00:40:03,470
[SPEAKER_16]: And especially those in the AP class, they all love you so much.

569
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:17,997
[SPEAKER_16]: effort in the future as we move forward to a more globalized and more open world.

570
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:22,343
[SPEAKER_16]: We should continue with all of the efforts that we've put into our language learning programs.

571
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:23,024
[SPEAKER_13]: Very nice.

572
00:40:23,104 --> 00:40:24,026
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice job, Justin.

573
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:38,407

574
00:40:38,527 --> 00:40:39,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Am I correct, Mr. Carlo?

575
00:40:40,569 --> 00:40:43,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Joe Pachi put up the funds for the scholarship.

576
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:44,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

577
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:47,174

[SPEAKER_19]: You know, this is an excellent thing.

594
00:41:41,433 --> 00:41:43,015
[SPEAKER_19]: And of course, we're going to approve it.

595
00:41:43,055 --> 00:41:45,096
[SPEAKER_19]: But I just want to set the record straight.

596
00:41:45,256 --> 00:41:50,741
[SPEAKER_19]: In terms of timeliness of us receiving this, I believe the students left yesterday and are returning tomorrow.

597
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:58,328
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it was unfortunately a situation where Mr. Fallon is new to our system and didn't realize it needed to come into us.

598
00:41:58,968 --> 00:41:59,749
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanted to bring it to you.

599
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:02,131
[SPEAKER_17]: But certainly in the future, we understand it needs to come to you.

600
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,393
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a motion of approval, sort of in retrospect.

601
00:42:06,513 --> 00:42:09,295
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's a great thing, and we know that it's wonderful for our students.

602
00:42:09,355 --> 00:42:14,058
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm certainly glad that they're going, and I look forward to hearing from them on their return.

603
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:15,900
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a motion for approval by Ms.

604
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Cunha, seconded by Ms.

605
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Kreatz.

606
00:42:18,421 --> 00:42:19,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Roll call vote, please.

607
00:42:20,203 --> 00:42:20,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Excuse me?

608
00:42:25,506 --> 00:42:26,347
[SPEAKER_13]: We're still approving it.

609
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,694
Sure, absolutely, absolutely

610
00:42:43,565 --> 00:42:45,846
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion for approval as amended, roll call vote.

611
00:42:46,226 --> 00:42:46,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Mrs. Cunha.

612
00:42:47,447 --> 00:42:47,567
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

613
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:48,427
[SPEAKER_19]: Mrs. DiBenedetto.

614
00:42:48,847 --> 00:42:49,047
Yes.

615
00:42:49,187 --> 00:42:49,788
[SPEAKER_19]: Mrs. Kreatz.

616
00:42:50,508 --> 00:42:50,628
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

617
00:42:50,648 --> 00:42:51,268
[SPEAKER_19]: Mrs. Mustone.

618
00:42:51,288 --> 00:42:51,928
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

619
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:52,409
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Scurry.

620
00:42:52,449 --> 00:42:52,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

621
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:53,549
[SPEAKER_19]: Mrs. Van der Kloot.

622
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:53,829
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

623
00:42:53,929 --> 00:42:54,429
[SPEAKER_19]: Mayor Burke.

624
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:54,769
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

625
00:42:54,809 --> 00:42:56,950
[SPEAKER_13]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, motion passes.

626
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:00,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Next up, report on professional development day, November 7, 2017.

627
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:04,473
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll call on our assistant superintendent to deliver this report.

628
00:43:05,773 --> 00:43:06,214
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening.

629
00:43:06,274 --> 00:43:09,755
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to call on Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli to come do the report with me, please.

630
00:43:15,047 --> 00:43:23,732
[SPEAKER_21]: On Tuesday, November 7th, Medgar Public Schools and staff participated in our first professional development day for this school year.

631
00:43:24,792 --> 00:43:31,656
[SPEAKER_21]: Elementary staff met at the McGlynn School and participated in grade level workshops on response to intervention.

632
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:44,063
[SPEAKER_21]: Teachers 21, a consulting firm from Newton Mass, worked with our staff to build a shared understanding of RTI fundamentals and help us consider our next steps.

633
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:53,290
[SPEAKER_21]: Staff learned about the structures, processes, and instructional practices needed for successful implementation of RTI.

634
00:43:53,970 --> 00:44:03,014
[SPEAKER_21]: In addition, staff collaboratively self-assessed current capacities and planned for the next steps for the implementation of RTI.

635
00:44:03,814 --> 00:44:08,956
[SPEAKER_21]: The middle schools participated in Study Island as a universal screening behavioral intervention tool.

636
00:44:09,635 --> 00:44:17,762
[SPEAKER_21]: Teachers learned to utilize study island questions and developed fall winter screener exams for grades six, seven, and eight.

637
00:44:18,642 --> 00:44:29,731
[SPEAKER_21]: Administrators and teachers reviewed behavioral interventions and developed their own pyramid to determine what is considered tier one, tier two, and tier three.

638
00:44:30,492 --> 00:44:33,915
[SPEAKER_21]: The Andrews and the McGlynn schools met at Medford High.

639
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:50,695
[SPEAKER_21]: Medford High School vocational and Curtis Tufts participated in workshops regarding specific building-based data collection in focus groups discussions and identified topics from their ongoing partnerships with Harvard University and Boston College.

640
00:44:51,816 --> 00:45:04,360
[SPEAKER_21]: Our paraprofessionals collaborated with each other in online curriculum in three research-based modules, independence, positive behavior supports, and effective communication.

641
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:12,556
[SPEAKER_21]: The fine arts department focused on teaching pathways through the music curriculum as well as concepts in education.

642
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:19,699
[SPEAKER_21]: Nurses, phys ed, and health education staff participated in safety care recertification training.

643
00:45:20,695 --> 00:45:39,710
[SPEAKER_21]: There were additional workshops in the following areas, technology, library, zones of regulation for early childhood and related service providers, grade level and competency portfolios, alternate portfolios, middle school foreign language and curriculum review.

644
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:43,392
[SPEAKER_21]: We had a jam-packed day on November 7th.

645
00:45:44,776 --> 00:45:50,626
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like to share with you some of the evaluations from our elementary, middle, and high schools.

646
00:45:51,367 --> 00:45:57,617
[SPEAKER_21]: For elementary, it was the ability to practice strategies in workshops, reinforcement of techniques,

647
00:45:58,363 --> 00:46:03,628
[SPEAKER_21]: that the teachers felt able to engage, persist, envision, and reflect in the workshops.

648
00:46:04,349 --> 00:46:06,331
[SPEAKER_21]: Relevant topics were discussed.

649
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,614
[SPEAKER_21]: Presenters were knowledgeable and engaging.

650
00:46:10,375 --> 00:46:14,939
[SPEAKER_21]: More time needed to be allowed for staff to collaborate, which is something that we need to work on.

651
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:21,786
[SPEAKER_21]: There were useful suggestions for RTI, and we're hoping to plan return visits for RTI.

652
00:46:22,787 --> 00:46:24,530
[SPEAKER_21]: So none of this is done alone.

653
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,133
[SPEAKER_21]: You've heard the saying, it takes a village.

654
00:46:27,614 --> 00:46:35,725
[SPEAKER_21]: So it really does when we get together and organize and plan our Professional Development Day program.

655
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:40,211
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd like Bernadette to speak a little bit to the middle school and high school reflections.

656
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:56,124
[SPEAKER_04]: So the reflections of teachers and what they experienced on PD is very important to us as administrators, but then also I'm a member of the Professional Development Committee, so we will be looking at these comments closely.

657
00:46:56,144 --> 00:47:06,093
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of good comments, and then there are some comments that really offer us some constructive advice on ways that the program could be made even stronger.

658
00:47:06,583 --> 00:47:07,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is just a sampling.

659
00:47:08,104 --> 00:47:09,425
[SPEAKER_04]: It certainly isn't everything.

660
00:47:09,585 --> 00:47:14,469
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a compilation of all of the responses from middle and high school teachers.

661
00:47:15,209 --> 00:47:17,751
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the middle school, some of the strengths were the following.

662
00:47:18,412 --> 00:47:24,276
[SPEAKER_04]: One teacher wrote, quote, that we were able to create a screener for next year that aligns both middle schools.

663
00:47:24,996 --> 00:47:35,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Another teacher wrote, the presenter, that would be Paul DeLeva, adjusted his presentation when he realized the audience needed or wanted something different on the content.

664
00:47:37,183 --> 00:47:42,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Another teacher wrote, the presenter was a great speaker and made the workshop as interesting as possible.

665
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:50,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked that we were given ample time to play around with the program, and he allowed the subject to veer off for more specific questions.

666
00:47:52,982 --> 00:47:57,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Then another prompt asked teachers how the workshop could have been improved.

667
00:47:58,485 --> 00:48:03,468
[SPEAKER_04]: And one teacher wrote focusing on subjects other than English language arts and math.

668
00:48:04,788 --> 00:48:09,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Another teacher wrote Chromebooks being provided to all staff during the training.

669
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:12,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Another teacher wrote altering the order of the program.

670
00:48:13,693 --> 00:48:23,481
[SPEAKER_04]: so that the morning should have been for the McGlynn to go over the basics of RTI, that is, what it is, what is the pyramid, what are the logistics, etc.

671
00:48:24,022 --> 00:48:32,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the afternoon could have been on how to use Study Island as a tool in RTI and collaborate with grade-level partners from both schools.

672
00:48:32,986 --> 00:48:36,407
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, that's just a snapshot of the middle school teachers' comments.

673
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:40,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, some positive and some where there are things that could be better.

674
00:48:41,249 --> 00:48:46,490
[SPEAKER_04]: With regard to the high school comments, one thing I noticed is many teachers wrote a lot.

675
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:51,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these are somewhat lengthy, but again, there's only a few of them.

676
00:48:52,303 --> 00:48:59,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were asked in the first prompt, what stood out about today's professional development program?

677
00:48:59,908 --> 00:49:08,075
[SPEAKER_04]: One teacher wrote, the thing that stood out the most was the video we watched in breakout sessions about microaggressions and microaffirmations.

678
00:49:08,555 --> 00:49:17,322
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a nice reminder to choose your words and the way you frame feedback carefully, as it can have a big impact on your students and their perceptions.

679
00:49:17,783 --> 00:49:24,088
[SPEAKER_04]: That's certainly something I know that I like to consider when I'm speaking to people.

680
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:35,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Another teacher wrote, just bringing into awareness the issues our kids are dealing with and the impact we have on making them feel included and capable, as well as happy and productive.

681
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:48,029
[SPEAKER_04]: A good reminder of how important positive feedback is, our role in helping students finding their purpose, and in helping them to see how what they do here is relevant to the rest of their lives.

682
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:57,338
[SPEAKER_04]: Another teacher wrote, this professional development day reminded me of how much the students need me as a teacher to create a safe environment for learning.

683
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:07,686
[SPEAKER_04]: By safe environment, I mean an inclusive one in which I demonstrate to each student that I care about each of them as people and I believe in their academic capabilities.

684
00:50:08,086 --> 00:50:14,331
[SPEAKER_04]: It reminded me to review my own journey as a professional and to renew my commitment to the profession.

685
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:24,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And the last comment from a teacher, the teacher writes, my biggest takeaway was that wow, this is really necessary.

686
00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:29,322
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I don't think that it was received by all faculty.

687
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:34,446
[SPEAKER_04]: I am very familiar with what was presented and I am well attuned to my passion and my purpose.

688
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:38,288
[SPEAKER_04]: It is something I live and it is something I share with my students.

689
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:42,551
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I saw that many of my peers were very closed

690
00:50:43,848 --> 00:50:44,969
[SPEAKER_04]: to today's PD day.

691
00:50:45,469 --> 00:50:51,234
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we as a faculty need to be brought through each step in order for people to see the value in this work.

692
00:50:51,714 --> 00:50:54,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard many people say that it was too much information at once.

693
00:50:55,537 --> 00:51:02,222
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, all of the feedback is considered seriously, and this was just a snapshot.

694
00:51:04,404 --> 00:51:04,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

695
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:05,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Vandekloot.

696
00:51:05,324 --> 00:51:06,445
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I didn't have a question.

697
00:51:06,765 --> 00:51:07,986
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any questions from the body?

698
00:51:09,187 --> 00:51:09,848
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

699
00:51:11,543 --> 00:51:16,886
[SPEAKER_10]: So last year at our budget time, there was big talk about adding more ITI instruction.

700
00:51:17,847 --> 00:51:29,192
[SPEAKER_10]: And this year is the year that we're really taking notice of where we are, what we're using it, how we're using it well, and where we're going to need in case we need that for next year's budget.

701
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:32,014
[SPEAKER_10]: So you guys are the experts.

702
00:51:32,174 --> 00:51:33,374
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's hear it.

703
00:51:33,474 --> 00:51:34,415
[SPEAKER_10]: We're at this point.

704
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:37,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we utilizing it well?

705
00:51:37,274 --> 00:51:42,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you foresee us needing some more help in the budget for next year?

706
00:51:43,575 --> 00:51:50,297
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know it will change from now to then, but we need to put the bug in the ear of the superintendent so it's on his radar.

707
00:51:50,997 --> 00:51:51,257
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

708
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:58,699
[SPEAKER_21]: So the elementary teachers now have a universal screening tool piloted in just grade one.

709
00:51:59,179 --> 00:52:03,700
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to take a look at this tool to see if it's something that we want for all of our grade levels.

710
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:05,574
[SPEAKER_21]: That was our beginning.

711
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,820
[SPEAKER_21]: We wanted to give an overview of response to intervention.

712
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:20,092
[SPEAKER_21]: Many of our teachers knew a lot about it because we've done some of this before, but we have a lot of new staff, so we wanted to make sure that they were able to participate.

713
00:52:20,791 --> 00:52:31,921
[SPEAKER_21]: We did grade level groups, K1, 2, 3, and 4, 5, and the presenters seemed to be, for the most part, very well received, especially the K1 presenter.

714
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:41,269
[SPEAKER_21]: From here, we will have the Professional Development Committee is recommending that we continue with RTI on our mandated PD days.

715
00:52:41,949 --> 00:52:51,833
[SPEAKER_21]: We have one in January and one in February, and we're hoping to continue our training in January and in February, and maybe even on the March PD day.

716
00:52:53,334 --> 00:53:05,500
[SPEAKER_21]: The grade one in all of the elementary schools will be piloting RTI, so they have a specific block of time that will be set aside for teachers to work with each other on RTI.

717
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,782
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it is the hope that we get together in March or April

718
00:53:11,457 --> 00:53:16,538
[SPEAKER_21]: to come to a consensus about the best way to roll it out for everyone come next September.

719
00:53:17,738 --> 00:53:19,719
[SPEAKER_21]: Additional monies would be helpful.

720
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:23,760
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to try to work within the budget to see what we can do with our own staff.

721
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,700
[SPEAKER_21]: They know our children better than anybody else.

722
00:53:28,721 --> 00:53:29,121
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

723
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:34,402
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive this paper and place it on file?

724
00:53:37,231 --> 00:53:37,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Ms.

725
00:53:37,832 --> 00:53:38,412
[SPEAKER_13]: Van De Kloet.

726
00:53:38,892 --> 00:53:39,633
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

727
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:41,054
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

728
00:53:41,494 --> 00:53:42,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

729
00:53:44,376 --> 00:53:46,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Report on MSBA school maintenance study.

730
00:53:47,117 --> 00:53:47,998
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

731
00:53:48,338 --> 00:53:55,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor and members of the school committee, I think we all know that building maintenance, building condition, is a popular topic.

732
00:53:57,304 --> 00:54:00,966
[SPEAKER_17]: The MSBA, Massachusetts School Building Authority,

733
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:11,718
[SPEAKER_17]: is the authority that's been put in place to assist with renovations, major renovations of schools, but they also try to keep track of where schools are.

734
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:20,863
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, we all know where the pimples are and where the tiles are missing in any one school in our own world.

735
00:54:21,403 --> 00:54:24,745
[SPEAKER_17]: But when you look at the range of schools across the Commonwealth,

736
00:54:25,738 --> 00:54:26,599
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't do badly.

737
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:31,364
[SPEAKER_17]: And the report I'm providing you is a report that it was done by MSBA.

738
00:54:31,985 --> 00:54:36,010
[SPEAKER_17]: It was done by a field visit to our schools by MSBA.

739
00:54:36,790 --> 00:54:41,195
[SPEAKER_17]: And they went to all the schools across the Commonwealth, virtually all of them, didn't get to everything.

740
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:53,159
[SPEAKER_17]: And they assessed and evaluated several key factors, including building condition, general environment, capacity, technology, security, and maintenance.

741
00:54:53,939 --> 00:55:01,505
[SPEAKER_17]: The study was conducted by architectural engineers, engineers in general, and who visited each specific building.

742
00:55:03,146 --> 00:55:09,690
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, school buildings that were slated for MSB upgrades, already slated in the pipeline, weren't visited because they already had been out there and done that.

743
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:12,953
[SPEAKER_17]: The buildings were rated on a four-point scale.

744
00:55:13,947 --> 00:55:16,328
[SPEAKER_17]: the general condition and general learning environment.

745
00:55:16,988 --> 00:55:21,069
[SPEAKER_17]: A rating of one was the best, and a rating of four was the lowest.

746
00:55:21,689 --> 00:55:24,370
[SPEAKER_17]: And all buildings were rated for capacity utilization.

747
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:32,453
[SPEAKER_17]: Underutilization was considered to be 80% or less, below 80% rather, and overutilization was above 125% of the capacity of the building.

748
00:55:37,105 --> 00:55:40,346
[SPEAKER_17]: So I provided you with selected pages of the MSBA report.

749
00:55:40,366 --> 00:55:41,266
[SPEAKER_17]: It was 96 pages.

750
00:55:41,306 --> 00:55:44,707
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't think you wanted to read it all, but if you do, I can certainly provide it.

751
00:55:45,107 --> 00:55:51,648
[SPEAKER_17]: I picked those pages I thought were relevant to us and would give us insights as to how they came up with these decisions.

752
00:55:52,248 --> 00:56:01,010
[SPEAKER_17]: But you'll note if you go down to Medford schools and the building condition, all of our schools, with the exception of the high school and the vocational school, were rated one.

753
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:04,010
[SPEAKER_17]: The high school and the vocational school were rated two.

754
00:56:05,271 --> 00:56:06,611
[SPEAKER_17]: But all our buildings,

755
00:56:07,272 --> 00:56:15,101
[SPEAKER_17]: for general environment were rated one based on their study, not something we did for them, not something we told them to say.

756
00:56:15,701 --> 00:56:18,104
[SPEAKER_17]: They came out and rated it with their people.

757
00:56:18,905 --> 00:56:20,247
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, building capacity,

758
00:56:22,428 --> 00:56:37,458
[SPEAKER_17]: We fall into the average range in every building, while Brooks, Columbus, McGlynn, and Roberts are considered average, the Andrews a little bit under, McGlynn under, high school under, vocational under, and the Curtis Tufts under, in terms of capacity, in terms of room.

759
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:41,701
[SPEAKER_17]: Now people talk to me about, is there capacity to absorb young people into our schools?

760
00:56:42,121 --> 00:56:42,622
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd say yes.

761
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:49,156
[SPEAKER_17]: Because I've looked at this, I gave you a report not that long ago on the impact of development upon enrollment.

762
00:56:49,876 --> 00:56:56,621
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm working on a report that deals with some of the smaller buildings, which there aren't that many with young people in it.

763
00:56:57,081 --> 00:57:01,824
[SPEAKER_17]: But clearly, that is not changing anything as far as I can see so far.

764
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:08,689
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think it's important when people ask us about our building conditions to recognize that we have had them looked at.

765
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:11,191
[SPEAKER_17]: There's certainly room for improvement.

766
00:57:11,231 --> 00:57:14,134
[SPEAKER_17]: No one's going to say that we do everything the way it should be done.

767
00:57:14,855 --> 00:57:23,324
[SPEAKER_17]: But clearly, we're not bad compared to buildings, school buildings around the commonwealth.

768
00:57:25,987 --> 00:57:31,033
[SPEAKER_17]: We have put in an SOI to the state, statement of interest for the high school and the vocational school.

769
00:57:31,872 --> 00:57:37,273
[SPEAKER_17]: We expect to hear before the first of the year whether or not we will be allowed to go to feasibility study.

770
00:57:37,933 --> 00:57:40,154
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe we're now in a pool of 44.

771
00:57:40,494 --> 00:57:40,834
[SPEAKER_17]: There were 88.

772
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,234
[SPEAKER_17]: We're now down to 44.

773
00:57:43,274 --> 00:57:46,895
[SPEAKER_17]: It may be less than that now since their last visit to us.

774
00:57:47,655 --> 00:57:54,436
[SPEAKER_17]: And hopefully we'll hear about that and we'll be able to move forward with a feasibility study looking at those two major buildings.

775
00:57:54,956 --> 00:57:56,597
[SPEAKER_17]: So happy to take any questions you may have.

776
00:57:56,617 --> 00:57:56,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Ms.

777
00:57:58,577 --> 00:57:58,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Pugno.

778
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:00,127
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

779
00:58:00,168 --> 00:58:07,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Through you to the superintendent, is there a way for us to find out how the other schools in our area were graded?

780
00:58:07,976 --> 00:58:09,498
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, they do have that.

781
00:58:10,058 --> 00:58:13,242
[SPEAKER_17]: We're generally better than many others, but there are some.

782
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:14,023
[SPEAKER_17]: I can get you that.

783
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:40,323
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I'd like to see the list of the surrounding schools and and just in general other schools Yeah, but it doesn't give that information just to see I can get you the rest of it just was a lot of pages No, and I understand that and I'm not asking for the whole report I'm just asking so that way we have an idea of where we rank compared to if it's okay with you What I'll do is I'll pick some area schools and give you you know some comparable type schools like Waltham and Winchester

784
00:58:41,243 --> 00:59:09,205
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I guess my other concern is We rate you know according to their standards We rated high does is that jeopardize any type of grant or anything that we're going to be going for because I mean Because we we graded very high based on their requisites I just don't want to jeopardize anything out there that we're waiting for like capital planning money or anything like that I mean are they going to take that into consideration obviously they're going to look at buildings that are for and

785
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,961
[SPEAKER_17]: But they also want to, if they put an app in.

786
00:59:14,461 --> 00:59:19,923
[SPEAKER_17]: And they also want to make sure that buildings that are doing okay, stay okay.

787
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,104
[SPEAKER_17]: And there are specific elements of our world.

788
00:59:24,004 --> 00:59:28,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Like in our world, we want to work on the systems in the high school and the vocation school.

789
00:59:28,806 --> 00:59:29,826
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to work on the shops.

790
00:59:30,346 --> 00:59:35,068
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to work on other aspects of the facility that will enhance it over time.

791
00:59:35,508 --> 00:59:37,648
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember that building is, what, over 45 years old now.

792
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:44,191
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a solid building, it's not going away, but it can use some upgrades.

793
00:59:44,891 --> 00:59:48,453
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think these are the things that we want to push with them.

794
00:59:48,473 --> 00:59:49,973
[SPEAKER_17]: So we had a very good meeting with them.

795
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:56,375
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought when they left, they were very pleased with the kind of tour that we took with them and the information we gave them.

796
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,316
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's competitive, so we'll find out.

797
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:04,318
[SPEAKER_07]: And was the tour across the board, like when they came to the high school, did they see the whole high school?

798
01:00:04,718 --> 01:00:06,118
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, they went around the whole place.

799
01:00:06,178 --> 01:00:07,399
[SPEAKER_07]: And the same thing with all the other schools?

800
01:00:07,419 --> 01:00:08,159
[SPEAKER_17]: They went around the whole place.

801
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:13,033
[SPEAKER_17]: Now remember, we've got an oil project from them, we've got the science projects from them.

802
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,601
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we've got some other things from them as well.

803
01:00:15,641 --> 01:00:18,323
[SPEAKER_17]: So it isn't like they've ignored us.

804
01:00:18,783 --> 01:00:24,466
[SPEAKER_17]: But clearly, you know, the things we were talking about with them were, I think, well-received.

805
01:00:24,486 --> 01:00:25,087
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

806
01:00:25,207 --> 01:00:31,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want them to say that they went into the science labs at the high school and just assumed that the rest of the school is like that, because it's not.

807
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,352
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, actually, I turned that around on them.

808
01:00:33,392 --> 01:00:35,713
[SPEAKER_17]: When I said to them, see, your money really was put to good use.

809
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:35,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

810
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep on telling them that, because it has to go through the whole district.

811
01:00:38,315 --> 01:00:39,355
[SPEAKER_17]: We're very good with your money.

812
01:00:39,375 --> 01:00:40,176
[SPEAKER_17]: You should give us more.

813
01:00:40,876 --> 01:00:41,156
[SPEAKER_17]: OK?

814
01:00:41,476 --> 01:00:42,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the whole district.

815
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:43,867
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

816
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:44,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Mustone.

817
01:00:45,388 --> 01:00:51,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Belson, the key factors were building condition, general environment, capacity, technology, security, and maintenance.

818
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they give us a rating in each of those categories of each of the schools?

819
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:56,011
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they composited.

820
01:00:56,031 --> 01:00:57,752
[SPEAKER_17]: The report did not break it down.

821
01:00:58,032 --> 01:00:59,672
[SPEAKER_08]: To see where we have holes.

822
01:00:59,933 --> 01:01:00,653
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't break it down.

823
01:01:00,673 --> 01:01:01,473
[SPEAKER_17]: They didn't break it down.

824
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:03,794
[SPEAKER_17]: But I can ask.

825
01:01:03,854 --> 01:01:04,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

826
01:01:04,274 --> 01:01:06,895
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any other questions?

827
01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:09,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to receive and place on file?

828
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:10,701
[SPEAKER_13]: Moved by Ms.

829
01:01:10,741 --> 01:01:12,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Van der Kloot, seconded by Ms.

830
01:01:12,162 --> 01:01:12,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Cuno.

831
01:01:12,862 --> 01:01:13,563
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

832
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:13,643
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

833
01:01:14,343 --> 01:01:15,044
[SPEAKER_13]: All those opposed?

834
01:01:15,344 --> 01:01:16,044
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

835
01:01:19,386 --> 01:01:24,109
[SPEAKER_13]: Recommendation to implement a succession plan for superintendent of schools.

836
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:31,594
[SPEAKER_13]: And before I pass this over to Roy, he's been with the school system for over 40 years?

837
01:01:31,614 --> 01:01:31,994
[SPEAKER_13]: 50 years now?

838
01:01:32,354 --> 01:01:32,655
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 years.

839
01:01:32,675 --> 01:01:33,655
[SPEAKER_13]: 23 as our superintendent.

840
01:01:37,038 --> 01:01:43,281
[SPEAKER_13]: He has served this community with pride and respect, and I know throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts how he is looked upon.

841
01:01:43,901 --> 01:01:50,864
[SPEAKER_13]: He really is a mentor to new superintendents, and just about any question you ask him, he pretty much knows the answer.

842
01:01:50,904 --> 01:01:52,584
[SPEAKER_13]: It's somewhere in there, and he pulls it out.

843
01:01:52,665 --> 01:01:56,366
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's been an amazing experience to work with you, Mr. Superintendent.

844
01:01:57,086 --> 01:02:01,168
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that this process will be difficult, but of course it will be positive at the end.

845
01:02:01,288 --> 01:02:05,670
[SPEAKER_13]: We know that we will find someone that will do things differently and maybe

846
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:09,192
[SPEAKER_13]: ignite the school system in a different way.

847
01:02:09,352 --> 01:02:13,115
[SPEAKER_13]: So we will miss you, but we look forward to this process.

848
01:02:13,216 --> 01:02:14,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

849
01:02:14,617 --> 01:02:15,998
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to announce it Monday night?

850
01:02:16,018 --> 01:02:16,798
[SPEAKER_17]: You want to talk about that?

851
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:17,079
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

852
01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:22,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, we have arranged for the school committee.

853
01:02:22,523 --> 01:02:23,124
[SPEAKER_17]: M-A-S-C.

854
01:02:23,784 --> 01:02:28,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Mass Association of School Committees to come and visit with us Monday evening so that we can start this process.

855
01:02:29,028 --> 01:02:32,291
[SPEAKER_13]: And they'll go over generalities of how they've conducted it in other communities.

856
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:38,583
[SPEAKER_13]: and determined what steps we want to take next as far as our search for the next superintendent.

857
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:46,067
[SPEAKER_13]: So that will be Monday at 6 30 at 6 30 at the high school, at the high school.

858
01:02:49,689 --> 01:02:50,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Superintendent.

859
01:02:51,511 --> 01:02:58,535
[SPEAKER_17]: So in June 2016, the Medford school committee approved the succession plan for the position of superintendent of schools.

860
01:02:59,335 --> 01:03:02,896
[SPEAKER_17]: I have attached a copy of that plan to my remarks this evening.

861
01:03:03,957 --> 01:03:12,800
[SPEAKER_17]: While it's within your discretion to keep, modify, and change the plan, it is a fundamental blueprint to begin the processes of succession and transition.

862
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:21,343
[SPEAKER_17]: And that will continue on Monday evening with Glenn Kuchar, who is the executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

863
01:03:22,884 --> 01:03:25,405
[SPEAKER_17]: It has been my privilege and honor

864
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:35,522
[SPEAKER_17]: to be an educator in Medford, in the Medford Public Schools, for 50 years, and to serve as superintendent of schools, your superintendent of schools, for 23 years.

865
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:47,085
[SPEAKER_17]: I've greatly benefited from the high quality and diligence of professionals, support staff, school committee members, and citizens who have worked with me throughout my career.

866
01:03:48,186 --> 01:03:53,027
[SPEAKER_17]: And I am internally grateful to them for making my tenure and responsibilities

867
01:03:53,605 --> 01:03:57,287
[SPEAKER_17]: as productive and as rewarding as reasonably possible.

868
01:03:58,548 --> 01:04:04,732
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been very fortunate to have seen former students become teachers, administrators, and staff in our schools.

869
01:04:05,632 --> 01:04:10,695
[SPEAKER_17]: I've had the experience of enrolling children and grandchildren of former students.

870
01:04:12,256 --> 01:04:22,502
[SPEAKER_17]: While no one does significant work alone, I've had the opportunity to build new schools, establish a full range of programs, acquire hundreds of millions of dollars in grants,

871
01:04:23,346 --> 01:04:24,727
[SPEAKER_17]: for our community and school district.

872
01:04:26,287 --> 01:04:34,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Understandably, there's room for improvement, but much has been done and more will be done in the months ahead.

873
01:04:35,792 --> 01:04:42,515
[SPEAKER_17]: No one gets to finish everything, but we have put a lot in place and that will be a solid foundation for the future.

874
01:04:43,835 --> 01:04:46,737
[SPEAKER_17]: Therefore, I am here informing the Medford School Committee

875
01:04:47,963 --> 01:04:57,568
[SPEAKER_17]: that it's my intention to retire from the position of superintendent of schools, Medford Public Schools, at the completion of my contract on June 30th, 2018.

876
01:04:57,688 --> 01:05:06,852
[SPEAKER_17]: This decision has been made without reference to any governmental change or any issues that are in our community.

877
01:05:07,632 --> 01:05:15,236
[SPEAKER_17]: It is simply the right period of time for me to spend more time with my family and to pursue special causes and interests

878
01:05:15,827 --> 01:05:21,891
[SPEAKER_17]: that have not been possible given the schedule and work responsibilities of an active school superintendent.

879
01:05:23,031 --> 01:05:28,095
[SPEAKER_17]: It is my intent and plan to be fully engaged in the months ahead as your superintendent.

880
01:05:28,895 --> 01:05:32,718
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a lot of positive opportunities, some of which we've talked about tonight, ahead of us.

881
01:05:33,538 --> 01:05:37,160
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will do everything possible to optimize and achieve our goals.

882
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:43,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Furthermore, I will be committed to ensuring a smooth and effective transition to new senior leadership.

883
01:05:44,265 --> 01:05:44,585
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

884
01:06:09,706 --> 01:06:10,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

885
01:06:10,486 --> 01:06:12,827
[SPEAKER_13]: I just personally want to thank the superintendent.

886
01:06:13,347 --> 01:06:14,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, I'm a new mayor.

887
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,568
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just almost wrapping up the first two years.

888
01:06:18,149 --> 01:06:22,890
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know what it would have been had I not had him by my side in charge of the school department.

889
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:31,092
[SPEAKER_13]: So I thank you personally for staying on so that we've had a smoother transition into my leadership.

890
01:06:31,412 --> 01:06:35,214
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you very much for doing that on behalf of the city of Medford in total.

891
01:06:35,674 --> 01:06:35,854
[SPEAKER_13]: Ms.

892
01:06:35,874 --> 01:06:36,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Van der Kloot.

893
01:06:37,846 --> 01:06:42,068
[SPEAKER_19]: So Roy, we knew this day would come, but it doesn't make the coming any easier.

894
01:06:42,488 --> 01:06:44,629
[SPEAKER_19]: You've been an exceptional leader for our community.

895
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:50,973
[SPEAKER_19]: Your commitment and dedication is simply, it can't be, it's unparalleled.

896
01:06:52,954 --> 01:06:57,496
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been on the school committee for a long time, so I've known and been able to work with you for a long time.

897
01:06:58,036 --> 01:07:03,159
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have to tell you, the number of nights that I found you in your office

898
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:13,245
[SPEAKER_19]: night after night after night, ready to respond to any question, ready to be there, is just unbelievable.

899
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:22,571
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, as a school committee, we can get to pick up the phone and call the superintendent, and it didn't matter was it weekend, it didn't matter whether he was on vacation.

900
01:07:23,611 --> 01:07:32,016
[SPEAKER_19]: And so some of us have talked to him when he was on vacation, and he was always there ready to answer questions.

901
01:07:33,597 --> 01:07:42,581
[SPEAKER_19]: I think of your great compassion to staff members who were under duress as something that was truly, you know, always unsung.

902
01:07:42,881 --> 01:07:44,082
[SPEAKER_19]: It was always below the level.

903
01:07:44,442 --> 01:07:49,844
[SPEAKER_19]: But when we had a staff member who was going through some crisis, Roy was always there and compassionate for them.

904
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:56,007
[SPEAKER_19]: His dedication to our students and the whole child approach, I think on some of these things, you led the pack.

905
01:07:56,227 --> 01:08:01,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Early childhood education, the Medford Family Network, so important in our world.

906
01:08:02,925 --> 01:08:06,147
[SPEAKER_19]: No superintendent can be everything to everybody.

907
01:08:06,887 --> 01:08:09,589
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep, superintendents piss people off sometimes.

908
01:08:09,989 --> 01:08:10,629
[SPEAKER_19]: They say no.

909
01:08:10,869 --> 01:08:11,970
[SPEAKER_19]: And you've done that, Roy.

910
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:17,533
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that there have been people who've not always been enthusiastic about your leadership.

911
01:08:18,133 --> 01:08:27,819
[SPEAKER_19]: But I, for one, as someone who has sat and worked with you, who've been on many different committees and worked with you, can only say that you have been a remarkable leader for us.

912
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:32,181
[SPEAKER_19]: Your work ethic is just the tops, and you have

913
01:08:33,001 --> 01:08:36,904
[SPEAKER_19]: Your dedication to Medford has been absolutely exemplary.

914
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:38,005
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you so much.

915
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:38,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Pauline.

916
01:08:38,926 --> 01:08:40,127
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

917
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:42,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Ms.

918
01:08:42,689 --> 01:08:43,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Cuno.

919
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:45,151
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

920
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:49,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I have had the opportunity, and I know what people are going to say out there.

921
01:08:49,855 --> 01:08:52,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know, the people that always agree with the superintendent.

922
01:08:53,158 --> 01:08:59,043
[SPEAKER_07]: However, my discussion is not about whether I agree or disagree with the superintendent.

923
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:00,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Here it is.

924
01:09:00,875 --> 01:09:03,255
[SPEAKER_07]: just a thank you for the person that he is.

925
01:09:04,296 --> 01:09:11,197
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been many a times that there are a lot of us that agree or disagree, but this is out of respect, out of respect for the gentleman that's here.

926
01:09:12,217 --> 01:09:25,320
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had the opportunity, not only as a Medford School Committee member, but also as a president of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, to actually go around the state with Mr. Bellson to see how he has represented us,

927
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:30,963
[SPEAKER_07]: always having us top of the list.

928
01:09:31,663 --> 01:09:42,309
[SPEAKER_07]: I know people agree to disagree, but you really don't know it all when you're not behind this reel, unfortunately, because there are a lot of things that it's amazing to see.

929
01:09:43,990 --> 01:09:50,874
[SPEAKER_07]: When I went to the statehouse and there was a discussion and the superintendent went and he testified.

930
01:09:51,635 --> 01:09:54,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were other superintendents there that day that were testifying.

931
01:09:55,056 --> 01:10:06,241
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing to see the amount of people that after they're done with their discussion, the reporters and other people from the state house, all those superintendents were there.

932
01:10:07,721 --> 01:10:08,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody went to Roy.

933
01:10:09,642 --> 01:10:10,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Who did he talk about?

934
01:10:11,443 --> 01:10:12,943
[SPEAKER_07]: He talked about the people in this city.

935
01:10:13,623 --> 01:10:17,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only the students and the parents, but the teachers and everybody else.

936
01:10:18,527 --> 01:10:27,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I don't want to talk about agreeing or disagreeing, because that's why we're here, to be respectful behind and in front of the reel.

937
01:10:28,636 --> 01:10:30,217
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where you come to discuss.

938
01:10:30,617 --> 01:10:37,884
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where you come to express what's going on.

939
01:10:38,264 --> 01:10:41,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It's funny, Paulette just said something about he'll answer that phone.

940
01:10:42,621 --> 01:10:43,663
[SPEAKER_07]: when he's on vacation.

941
01:10:44,264 --> 01:10:50,736
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember 12 years ago when I started and I wanted to bring the summer program into fruition.

942
01:10:51,717 --> 01:11:21,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember going to that school the first day, and we had tons of kids there with parents dropping them off, and of course it was the hottest day, and the summer hadn't even started, and the people in charge had shut the air conditioning on me, and I called him, and he answered, and I'm like, I am sorry, but, and I went into a rage, and he's like, don't worry, he's like, the second I get off the plane, because I'm stepping on the plane, he says, I will call, and that air conditioning was on.

943
01:11:21,507 --> 01:11:32,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's things like that that you remember, but honestly when I've had the opportunity to go around the state and I've had the opportunity nationally to tell people that we've had superintendents.

944
01:11:32,548 --> 01:11:36,491
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing, because they say, what do you mean you have a superintendent who's been there all these years?

945
01:11:36,971 --> 01:11:39,673
[SPEAKER_07]: You're lucky if you get someone who stays with you two to three years.

946
01:11:39,994 --> 01:11:40,654
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've seen it.

947
01:11:41,294 --> 01:11:43,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen it in the communities around us.

948
01:11:43,476 --> 01:11:48,760
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, it's very difficult to get someone who's very qualified, because the candidate pool is not that large.

949
01:11:52,034 --> 01:11:52,935
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just amazing.

950
01:11:52,995 --> 01:12:04,482
[SPEAKER_07]: And when people tell me you work with a school committee, or you work as a school committee, or you actually speak to your superintendent, again, it seemed very strange to me, because I just assumed this is how it goes.

951
01:12:05,442 --> 01:12:12,126
[SPEAKER_07]: I am in total shock when I hear other school committee members across the state that tell me, what are you talking about?

952
01:12:12,146 --> 01:12:14,067
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you mean you have community participation?

953
01:12:14,788 --> 01:12:16,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, well, that's why we're here.

954
01:12:16,809 --> 01:12:17,810
[SPEAKER_07]: We're here for the community.

955
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,050
[SPEAKER_07]: They should have participation.

956
01:12:19,571 --> 01:12:19,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope.

957
01:12:20,411 --> 01:12:21,332
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not allowed to speak.

958
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:34,748
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there are things that we just assume as a school committee member, as a parent, as a teacher, administrator, what we're used to sometimes, we're just assuming this is how it is across the board.

959
01:12:34,868 --> 01:12:36,849
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're always complaining about what we have.

960
01:12:37,469 --> 01:12:45,715
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you have the opportunity to go outside your city and to see what other things and other people are doing and other cities and towns are doing, again, there's always improvement.

961
01:12:46,935 --> 01:12:48,376
[SPEAKER_07]: The bar is always raised up high.

962
01:12:48,937 --> 01:12:50,718
[SPEAKER_07]: But to see where we are.

963
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:55,969
[SPEAKER_07]: is just really, you know, it's, I'm very happy to see it.

964
01:12:56,189 --> 01:13:00,878
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have to say that it's people like the superintendent who go out there with their passion.

965
01:13:02,157 --> 01:13:05,138
[SPEAKER_07]: and get what we have, because it's not that easy sometimes.

966
01:13:05,638 --> 01:13:07,699
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to say thank you to the superintendent.

967
01:13:08,059 --> 01:13:08,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

968
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:09,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

969
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:10,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Kurtz.

970
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:13,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Superintendent Bellson, I want to thank you for 50 years of service.

971
01:13:14,262 --> 01:13:17,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so glad that you stayed on because you... Oh, I'm sorry.

972
01:13:18,464 --> 01:13:19,324
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not... Oh, sorry.

973
01:13:19,884 --> 01:13:24,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so glad that you were on for our first term and you made our transition very smooth.

974
01:13:25,747 --> 01:13:26,667
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a great leader.

975
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:36,685
[SPEAKER_06]: You've always been there for questions, like everybody said, via email, phone call, late nights, late Sundays, for little things that come up.

976
01:13:36,765 --> 01:13:40,267
[SPEAKER_06]: And you've helped assist with, you know, parent inquiries.

977
01:13:40,787 --> 01:13:41,608
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just everything.

978
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:46,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I'm just – I'm really grateful and I'm very fortunate that I got to work with you.

979
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:48,851
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it's bittersweet news.

980
01:13:48,931 --> 01:13:50,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I wish you the best.

981
01:13:50,192 --> 01:13:53,554
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm, you know, happy to continue working with you for the next six months.

982
01:13:53,894 --> 01:13:54,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

983
01:13:54,314 --> 01:13:54,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

984
01:13:58,318 --> 01:14:00,299
[SPEAKER_13]: On the paper, is there a motion to receive in place?

985
01:14:01,059 --> 01:14:01,979
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not blinking up here.

986
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:03,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Skerry.

987
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:16,185
[SPEAKER_18]: Roy, it's been a long run, it's been a great run, and for anyone to spend 50 years of their life dedicated to education, it's remarkable and you're gonna be commended.

988
01:14:16,945 --> 01:14:25,248
[SPEAKER_18]: And I want you to know, just as one member, my colleagues have said it best, but as one member, Medford is in a better place educationally

989
01:14:25,902 --> 01:14:30,285
[SPEAKER_18]: through your efforts for the last 38 years that you've been running the system.

990
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:34,628
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think there is anyone that will master the budget as well as you.

991
01:14:35,849 --> 01:14:38,191
[SPEAKER_18]: We've all had concerns at budget time some years.

992
01:14:38,431 --> 01:14:44,355
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been tough, but you've always found a way to make sure that the needs of our children and our residents are met.

993
01:14:45,276 --> 01:14:49,559
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wish you and Maxine well in your retirement, and don't be a stranger.

994
01:14:49,939 --> 01:14:50,260
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

995
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,240
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

996
01:14:52,781 --> 01:14:52,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Ms.

997
01:14:52,881 --> 01:14:53,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Mustone.

998
01:14:54,373 --> 01:14:56,734
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to congratulate you and wish you well.

999
01:14:56,915 --> 01:14:59,616
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you are officially retired, we'll go out for a Guinness.

1000
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:04,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to the food bank.

1001
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:06,320
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto.

1002
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1003
01:15:09,862 --> 01:15:12,704
[SPEAKER_10]: So Roy, I've learned a tremendous amount from you.

1004
01:15:13,484 --> 01:15:19,308
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've watched blue and white run through your veins.

1005
01:15:20,188 --> 01:15:22,592
