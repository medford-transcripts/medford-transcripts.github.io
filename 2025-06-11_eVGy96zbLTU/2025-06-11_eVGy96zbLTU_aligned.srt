1
00:00:00,771 --> 00:00:02,673
while blocking off and keeping students safe.

2
00:00:02,693 --> 00:00:14,079
So I would say student safety isn't really the concern when we're preparing sites because that is a given across all of our sites.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:27,487
There might be a little more planning that goes into the logistics of the phasing to make sure that everything works well and goes smoothly during construction.

4
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:29,128
I think

5
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:35,057
That, and I just want to be clear that we can also put together kind of.

6
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:39,519
You know, we can put together this in frozen ponds about.

7
00:00:40,319 --> 00:00:45,160
You know, looking at these sites and the advantages and disadvantages if that is helpful.

8
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:49,661
But I don't think that there is that trade off with student safety.

9
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:51,302
1 way or the other.

10
00:00:51,322 --> 00:00:58,444
I just want to mention, I don't think the cost savings of not doing extra surveys is really much compared to.

11
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:05,753
The cost of the project, but 1 thing I, I would love in theory to study other sites and just think it helps us, like, you know, justify what we do in the end.

12
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:06,913
We've done our due diligence.

13
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,454
But if it ends up, there really is a feasibility to do it.

14
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:10,414
I'd like said.

15
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:12,014
It's not worth the time.

16
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:13,455
I think we're going to take the study.

17
00:01:13,475 --> 00:01:16,816
And also, I think the, the issue with doing something like we built on place that is.

18
00:01:17,236 --> 00:01:19,976
You need to replicate those amenities somewhere else, like, a theory here.

19
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,177
Which I assume MSBA wouldn't reimburse us for.

20
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:26,618
So, like, we would have to build soccer fields and playgrounds and fields.

21
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:30,445
here in a site that would be left, you know, a total mess.

22
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:36,387
So that's, to me, that's why it's a big advantage to try and keep it along one site, especially a place that is not the perfect site otherwise, right?

23
00:01:36,447 --> 00:01:38,248
It's not gonna fit everyone.

24
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:56,055
And it's just in Medford Square, when we made this, like, sort of decision to put it into the conversation, and RFP hadn't yet been released for the city on parcel, it now has, project's been awarded, there's a whole, like, revitalization plan happening that is, like,

25
00:01:56,607 --> 00:02:01,171
you know, that train is moving down the track faster than our study is able to move.

26
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,493
So that is another consideration.

27
00:02:03,513 --> 00:02:08,017
So I think Medford Square is like not an option anymore for that reason.

28
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:08,718
Luke?

29
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,043
And just to be fair, I'm not hearing, I feel that they're advocating for one site or another.

30
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:17,305
That comes from us.

31
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:24,451
I just wanted to, I guess, state that, because that's the way I'm hearing it, right?

32
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:28,932
Like, we'll tell you where we think, where we would like things surveyed.

33
00:02:29,172 --> 00:02:31,253
Yes, that's absolutely correct.

34
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:38,056
And I will say, I think what left, especially for Columbus Park, this site right that we're on right now is almost 30 acres.

35
00:02:38,556 --> 00:02:45,379
Columbus Park was five acres, just for, you know, in perspective.

36
00:02:45,992 --> 00:02:47,954
And can we have the city's survey?

37
00:02:48,394 --> 00:02:54,819
Because I remember the survey, and I remember Alicia kind of stepping through and explaining pros and cons.

38
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,242
Certainly elevations are different throughout the city, and she studied it.

39
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:01,204
The city, her department studied it.

40
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:03,225
There is a presentation.

41
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:13,253
Is that something that, I guess, would go in a repository, a library for our organization, for our reference?

42
00:03:13,998 --> 00:03:15,119
We certainly do that.

43
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:24,367
The meeting, the meeting was reported that we had at that time and it was, it is available on the YouTube channel as well.

44
00:03:24,467 --> 00:03:27,029
So if people want to go back and watch that meeting, they certainly can.

45
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:31,693
I'm going to take a couple of questions from Zoom.

46
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:32,593
Mayor?

47
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:36,237
Thank you, Chair Graham.

48
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:47,164
First of all, I just sorry I'm not there in person again I just came from CHS grand opening over at Cabot, and by the time I get there I might just go home while I'm in the car.

49
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:48,445
Anyway, I wanted to.

50
00:03:49,766 --> 00:03:51,868
I think I lean towards the one side although I like.

51
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:57,012
I understand Libby's comments, just comparison for long run discussion.

52
00:03:57,472 --> 00:04:20,269
My question, I guess, to left field is if we do only choose the one site, does that allow us more opportunity to explore different options on the Medford High School complex, such as building on maybe the field of dreams and trying to fit in as many fields as we can for our students and athletes, as well as doing it by piecemeal.

53
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:34,568
Yes, I would say that by taking the other options off the table, especially if they don't seem as viable, we are able to take more time to study more options on this site.

54
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:39,445
The MSBA requires us to at least study a code upgrade only.

55
00:04:39,965 --> 00:04:49,829
Renovation, we'll have renovation addition options and we'll have a full new construction so that there will be a number of options on this site that will be studied.

56
00:04:50,269 --> 00:04:56,612
So that it's not just us putting, not just the project team saying this is your one solution on this site.

57
00:04:57,332 --> 00:05:02,294
That is the process that MSBA takes you through to make sure that you have looked at all of the options.

58
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:06,023
Great, thank you.

59
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:11,598
Is there a way because I know that we had a conversation with some people at city hallway with Alicia.

60
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:39,216
the Andrews Middle School, which is the other side of town, and put the high school there, for example, in that larger space, so that you had patrons both on one location, for example, and she kind of communicates to us like the various problems that could come up with that, not only because of the size issue, as you mentioned, obviously, acreage, but also because the ground itself is not actually vital for that size building to be able to handle that much weight, I guess.

61
00:05:39,556 --> 00:05:41,977
I don't know the science, of course, and so is there a way that

62
00:05:47,041 --> 00:06:10,040
better try like a soft kind of research within various areas so that we can of course like cover our due diligence but not necessarily commit as much resources to every single site location because if we know that some sizing like acreage wise is just not going to be viable within the first couple of hours of like doing basic research we understand that it won't work we can still say to the community we understand that we've tried other locations very quickly we realized this wasn't going to work we were still led to where we

63
00:06:17,035 --> 00:06:19,716
a little bit more drastic, but to kind of cover both things.

64
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:20,296
I do agree.

65
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:29,778
I think ultimately, if we, if we know that this size wise, the best place to do it, as well as we already have some of the more like occasional spaces, the pool's a bigger question mark, obviously.

66
00:06:30,118 --> 00:06:38,900
I think that there is value to maintaining one space, but also saving the community that we try our best to cover other spaces as well.

67
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,302
Is that, is that something that the left field team may be able to help us with, like from a like,

68
00:06:45,810 --> 00:07:13,279
sort of roughed all kind of assessment to say like really, you know, if we look at these sites and we can, we can point you to the direction of that meeting that was recorded and some of those sites it certainly I'm sure Director Hunt would be happy to chat with you, but even just some sort of a chart of like, here's all the sites that are like even possible and here's the Bedford and here's what they, here's what they look like.

69
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:14,740
And, you know, from your

70
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:16,612
Perspective, are they viable?

71
00:07:16,652 --> 00:07:17,353
Yes or no.

72
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:24,438
So that when we rule them out, like, we're, we're doing that with a record of a recommendation of some kind.

73
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:25,939
Is that helpful?

74
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:28,621
And by the spoiler, we're going to have a little bit of free time here.

75
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:30,842
So you might be able to do that.

76
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:35,246
Without really changing the trajectory of the rest of the project.

77
00:07:35,826 --> 00:07:39,569
Absolutely, we would love to do that and I think that would be a really good.

78
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,031
Good thing to do to your point of.

79
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:44,973
Proving to the community that these are.

80
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:51,894
Options that we looked at, but we'll have actual reasons to back up why they don't work and it'll be clear.

81
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:59,338
It'll be in a document that provided pointed to, especially when you guys do come to a consensus on a single option.

82
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,820
A lot of people at that point will ask, well, what about this?

83
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:02,580
What about this?

84
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,240
What it will have?

85
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,442
The process laid out.

86
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:07,043
Yeah, I do think that.

87
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,285
The MSBA will still look for that as well.

88
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:10,865
You know, just.

89
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:13,767
You know, this is why we landed on this site.

90
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:14,307
Yeah, look.

91
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,922
you know, why we didn't pursue them any further.

92
00:08:18,043 --> 00:08:35,997
Sorry to jump in, but I think one of the key points in order to determine what a high school site is, is if you make the determination, if the city is willing to have the school and the fields as two separate entities, then that opens up a lot of options, right?

93
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:42,362
But if there's very little appetite for the city to have to bus kids for the fields,

94
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:48,489
then that immediately takes us from this many options and these sizes down to this, right?

95
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:52,992
We're going to be within a typical acreage of say 10 to 12, right?

96
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:59,696
If you don't want to shift the students off for the fields, take those two pieces.

97
00:09:00,377 --> 00:09:08,542
By the time you add together the fields and building it, it could just be one or two fields, but it still narrows that down significantly.

98
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:11,484
Emily?

99
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:16,619
Um, I love the idea of playing something out for the public.

100
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:31,050
On city council, we've had a lot of conversations around zoning, where when we move to the next phase of zoning and it starts to affect a new neighborhood, a lot of people will say, this is going too fast.

101
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,351
Why did this just start?

102
00:09:32,812 --> 00:09:33,933
This is out of nowhere.

103
00:09:34,313 --> 00:09:37,075
You just came out with this all of a sudden.

104
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:40,859
And then we have to say, well, we've actually been doing this for quite some time.

105
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:43,461
It just hasn't started to affect you until now.

106
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:45,643
But we can then go back and say,

107
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:54,090
Here's the website where, you know, so I think that's a great call with, like, maybe 1 version that's highly detailed 1 version that's very visual and simple.

108
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:59,575
Maybe with, like, I don't have to tell you guys.

109
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:03,118
But the 2nd thing I wanted to ask about is, I understand that the pool.

110
00:10:04,359 --> 00:10:07,943
Will not be part of the project at all.

111
00:10:08,063 --> 00:10:11,966
Do you speak or or could you speak to that a little bit more?

112
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:12,587
I'm I'm.

113
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:15,276
I think I don't have full clarity on it.

114
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:28,332
I think that's maybe another point about this site and a different site that would be worth understanding for all of us, that if we were to use a different site, how would that affect the pool?

115
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:47,272
Absolutely, so the MSBA, there are certain spaces and certain guidelines of space allotment in spaces that the MSBA deems eligible costs, which means they will participate in funding.

116
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:49,053
They will not participate in funding.

117
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:58,157
An option, if you do stay on this site, is to renovate the whole area and separate that portion of the building and

118
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:09,276
you know, create maybe a mostly new building with that as a renovated portion so that the cost of keeping the pool isn't as significant as building a new pool.

119
00:11:10,357 --> 00:11:14,520
You could, you do have the option to, to build a new pool.

120
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:18,403
It would completely be on the City of Bedford's dime.

121
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:23,607
But, and that's something that you'd have to work through, especially with the community to make sure they understand.

122
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:27,109
You can renovate with, as part of the.

123
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:32,658
Yeah, if the building stays here and the desire is to keep the pool, yeah, I think

124
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:53,168
put into the pool is going to be 100% non-diverse.

125
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:55,789
So we want to be smart about that.

126
00:11:55,809 --> 00:11:56,689
And we've seen schools.

127
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:58,369
I know out of our high school needs to have a pool.

128
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:03,531
And I think they got rid of it because when they just redid their school, MSBA wouldn't contribute.

129
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:07,992
And they just weren't getting the return on investment, so to say, from it.

130
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:14,734
So we have seen pools go away because of how the MSBA has looked.

131
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:16,154
Dr. Cushing, did you have a question?

132
00:12:16,214 --> 00:12:17,555
I thought I saw Dr. Cushing's hand up.

133
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:18,595
I just didn't want to distract.

134
00:12:20,982 --> 00:12:22,223
Sorry, could you just repeat that?

135
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:23,844
Did you have a question?

136
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:26,906
No, more just having worked on.

137
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,410
We lost you.

138
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:35,733
Oh, are we literally losing?

139
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:38,715
OK.

140
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:40,716
Now that he's speaking.

141
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:42,878
He'll be back.

142
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:43,218
Luke?

143
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:49,503
So in one of the forums that we filled out, I don't recall if it was the educational profile

144
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:58,844
One of the others, we described how pool actually serves an important part of our curriculum that is deeply felt by the community.

145
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:09,889
So we need to continue to have a pool for honoring that part of the curriculum.

146
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:15,431
I wanted to ask about our gymnasium, which strikes me as very large, but I'm no expert.

147
00:13:16,972 --> 00:13:19,073
If we didn't stay at this site,

148
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,193
could we recreate a gymnasium that large and be reimbursed?

149
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:24,694
Is that something?

150
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:40,224
A lot of times the MSB will work with you on certain square footages, like if it's what you have now and it's maxed out and you can't go smaller, they may work with you if you're like, yeah, we want to double the size of that.

151
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,426
Our gym is very big.

152
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:44,307
It is not a typical sized gym.

153
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:49,908
I was going to say, it's a field house.

154
00:13:51,229 --> 00:14:10,973
They allow up to 12,000 square feet for a high school for gyms, but that would be a conversation and we'll get into it in a little bit, but we're going to be working on an educational plan for the school and laying out spaces that are required, programs that use those spaces and usage rates.

155
00:14:11,873 --> 00:14:15,194
is all going to kind of factor into having that discussion with the MSBA.

156
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:24,317
Another option, like the pool, if it's in good shape to keep, it might be worth renovating instead of building new in that case.

157
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:25,497
We'll take a look at that.

158
00:14:25,517 --> 00:14:25,857
Nicole?

159
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:31,559
As someone who didn't go to this high school, are the pool locker rooms separate from the field house locker rooms, or are they shared?

160
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:31,939
OK.

161
00:14:32,099 --> 00:14:40,002
So in theory, because I'm thinking from my knowledge of Durfee, if you were to renovate the pool,

162
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:50,301
Like would it, you could then make a multi-use locker room, like so you're not then like paying for it, like renovating the pool and paying for a new pool locker room, like in theory, is that something that could happen?

163
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:51,922
Yeah, in theory, yeah.

164
00:14:52,022 --> 00:14:58,807
It really depends on, you know, the layout of the building, the design, how it all fits, but yeah, in theory.

165
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:06,353
So, I mean, on the one hand, I definitely think we need to have something that we can tell the public, we considered this in

166
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,511
comfortable with spending any money to do that.

167
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:18,273
Because if you tell me we have a 30 acre site, if you spend money to study at a five acre site, I'm going to be like, what?

168
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:25,135
It's kind of like, you know, you have 12 kids and you're going to study, but you can afford to live in a, whether a one bedroom is the right choice for you.

169
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,016
It would be kind of wild.

170
00:15:28,936 --> 00:15:32,678
If they were, they were close, I would be like, let's spend the money.

171
00:15:32,738 --> 00:15:35,138
But five acres is the larger of those sites.

172
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:36,279
And

173
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,034
I just, I don't want us to say, oh, we only spent $100,000 determined by the site.

174
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:49,399
Is that too small for something, but we're already on a 30 acre site that.

175
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:54,825
We should be able to say that that's the case, but I don't think we should spend money.

176
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:59,349
So, so I guess I think that's a good question for just for us to understand, like.

177
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:11,159
if we were to ask you all to help us build that chart, whatever it is, chart, one pager, like I've talked about a lot of one pagers today, so I'll just call it that for lack of a better term.

178
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:17,223
But if we were to do that, is that in the scope of your current services as our OPM?

179
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:18,223
Yes, okay.

180
00:16:18,804 --> 00:16:19,764
Maria?

181
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:30,291
One thing that I have heard about this location over the years, not just because of this project, is that we're in the least populated area of the city,

182
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:36,640
And the more dense populations in other areas want to be closer to their school.

183
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,003
We're at the opposite, you know, complete opposite end on the Winchester line.

184
00:16:41,063 --> 00:16:50,530
It has, you know, some people would like to see it somewhere else and they might even suffer the size of the property to have it closer.

185
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,251
Oh, I know.

186
00:16:54,143 --> 00:17:01,331
Yes, we did have that conversation, but we did have that conversation so I think that would be a great meeting to go rewatch.

187
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:10,922
Director Hunt was really insightful about that while Columbus Park is not unlike this site.

188
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:25,304
It does, it could move the school to an economically disadvantaged area and provide access to people who lack that access to our high school today on foot, right?

189
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:33,008
So there is value to looking at that site from that perspective, but it is one sixth the size of this site.

190
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:41,111
If we would be making real trade-offs, pool, playing fields, we'd probably have like a five-story high school.

191
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:42,352
There would be no parking.

192
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:43,755
all the things, right?

193
00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:52,119
So I think it is a good, we had that, we actually did have a detailed conversation about like, where are those places?

194
00:17:52,179 --> 00:18:12,167
That's why we talked about like the Andrews-McLinton complex, because that could serve that purpose, but the complexities of that, and frankly, the cost of doing a swap is like exponentially like outside of this VA is going to entertain for reimbursement.

195
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:12,607
So that

196
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:20,045
made it sort of not on the list, but to your point, like we know what those sites are that the community talks about.

197
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:27,508
So I don't think it would be that hard for them to put together something that just provides those talking points.

198
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:31,789
So when people say, but did you ever consider like, yes, we, we did.

199
00:18:31,969 --> 00:18:33,470
And we did that multiple steps.

200
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,330
We did that as a group a year ago.

201
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:40,152
We did it when we signed off unanimously on our education profile, we're going to do it again.

202
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,348
Here, but what we're not going to do is a design study that.

203
00:18:44,268 --> 00:18:48,671
Spends money, putting a building together on a property that is not right.

204
00:18:48,952 --> 00:18:52,534
So I feel like this is this is part of why we have an.

205
00:18:52,854 --> 00:18:54,936
Use our services to do that.

206
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:56,437
That might make sense.

207
00:18:56,657 --> 00:19:05,883
I have a question just so with the Columbus site, you mentioned that the hospital and having fields at a different location was that site chosen partly because, like, the tough.

208
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:12,427
park next to the club, the Curtis Tufts was like considered for fields or is that not?

209
00:19:12,507 --> 00:19:13,807
Was that not part of?

210
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,868
Medford does not have lots of free space.

211
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:26,851
So there were very few options essentially that would like there's very few pieces of big swaths of property that Medford has.

212
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:29,491
So there's just only a handful of choices.

213
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:32,532
So that's sort of how it was identified.

214
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:35,753
And sort of similarly,

215
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:56,449
Medford Square being fairly undeveloped right now is how it got identified and certainly there's huge value from a planners perspective and Alicia talks a lot about this meeting like there's huge value from a planner's perspective to putting a high school like near the middle of the city right like there's just tons of economic advantage to that.

216
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:03,202
However, there's a lot of economic advantage to the current proposal that is like moving forward too.

217
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:10,487
So again, like the timing of saying that's part of why we put Medford Square on the list because it is the middle, right?

218
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:20,475
Like for all intents and purposes of the city, it would increase access to lots of people, but you would be trading or playing fields on profit and all those other things.

219
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:26,240
The city has moved forward in sort of a different direction since then, which is just sort of what happens

220
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,061
When there's, you know, these press are a bit longer, right?

221
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:31,562
So.

222
00:20:33,002 --> 00:20:37,424
Um, I wasn't, I just wasn't there.

223
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:38,404
I was not in that meeting.

224
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:43,186
Um, but did we consider any taking cities like.

225
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:50,468
I mean, I know that the additional cost takings, I don't know, does MSBA help cover those?

226
00:20:50,588 --> 00:20:51,508
No, we're in our room.

227
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:54,509
All right, well, everything costs so much today, so.

228
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,151
Well, just scores.

229
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,012
Yeah, that's good.

230
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:01,233
Fred?

231
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:08,519
I just wanted to say, I think any viable design firm that's looking at these feasibility studies is doing the same thing.

232
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,343
They're out there looking at sites, and if they have any brilliant ideas.

233
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:17,866
They're listening to our meeting right now.

234
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:22,350
They know what we know, and they could come to the same conclusion.

235
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,052
Or bring something to the table and say, have you thought it out?

236
00:21:27,164 --> 00:21:30,925
And you can say, yes, we have 10 years off this.

237
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:33,346
So piggyback on that.

238
00:21:33,406 --> 00:21:36,527
It would be easier for everyone if we were building on a new site.

239
00:21:37,127 --> 00:21:37,908
Probably cheaper, too.

240
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:39,768
Well, I don't know about that.

241
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:46,371
But I think everyone would love to do it if there were some great place to just leave this place undisturbed for three years of construction.

242
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:49,952
But if we can't find it, we can't force it.

243
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:54,027
it's like we're making it, we're not making it any easier on ourselves by staying here.

244
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,007
So it's not like the easy way out or anything like that.

245
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:00,608
We'll know that we're not making it easier.

246
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,229
We're not making it easier.

247
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:05,250
We're not spitting a bottle full of money.

248
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,730
Right.

249
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:07,750
And we're not also making it harder than it needs to be.

250
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:08,991
Like, that's just kind of the reality of it.

251
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:09,491
Yeah.

252
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:10,791
Yeah.

253
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:12,051
That's our talk for us.

254
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:14,272
And I do apologize.

255
00:22:14,472 --> 00:22:18,913
I do apologize if this was already discussed, but, and I was not at that meeting.

256
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:23,105
But Columbus Park, was there a discussion about what would happen to the mistletoe?

257
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:25,548
No, no, no.

258
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:34,122
It was a very cursory discussion of like, what even are the places that are big enough for us to entertain?

259
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:42,463
Because I think it's important to know if you don't know the Mistletoe that there are stairs in the playground of the Mistletoe that lead to Columbus Park.

260
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:48,646
So if you were taking that away, you would be taking away space from the Mistletoe.

261
00:22:48,927 --> 00:22:55,771
Well, you would be taking the field, that adjacent field that the school does use regularly.

262
00:22:56,211 --> 00:23:00,473
But I think just also having a high school right attached.

263
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:02,995
Yeah, it would be literally.

264
00:23:04,607 --> 00:23:06,868
If we're keeping them, it's the top where it is.

265
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:07,789
Yeah.

266
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:09,730
Right.

267
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,171
And I don't know then where you would put parking.

268
00:23:13,252 --> 00:23:13,492
Right.

269
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:15,153
Because it is in the middle of a neighborhood.

270
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:15,933
Yeah.

271
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:18,394
Luke?

272
00:23:18,834 --> 00:23:33,082
What I don't recall being discussed in the past, but something that jumps out at me every time I think about this project, is when this school was sized initially in the late 60s, it was constructed for a school population of, I think, 36,000.

273
00:23:37,321 --> 00:23:43,045
And at one point, they actually had 4,400 kids at its peak, I think in the early 80s.

274
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:44,225
Maybe it was 4,000.

275
00:23:44,886 --> 00:23:46,427
At any rate, very large numbers.

276
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:50,950
Today, we don't have even half that population.

277
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,933
So we have twice the space we need for the number of kids.

278
00:23:56,013 --> 00:24:04,218
Well, I think that is a simplistic view of the space because education has changed dramatically since the 70s.

279
00:24:04,979 --> 00:24:06,820
And our vocational spaces have

280
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:11,155
ignorantly different space requirements than classrooms do.

281
00:24:11,175 --> 00:24:20,679
So I can't wait actually to find out how big the high school should be, because I think there's a lot of opinions about how the building's going to be half the size.

282
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,741
And I think there will be facts about that soon enough.

283
00:24:25,021 --> 00:24:26,202
Sure, but just to finish my point.

284
00:24:26,562 --> 00:24:34,786
So the thing that I've heard discussed is in a pitch during a construction period, would it be feasible to move

285
00:24:35,263 --> 00:24:47,052
HAB-Michael Lecceserer-Moderator): All the kids to one half knock down the old half build and then when that's complete we pop populate the new building and potentially renovate or knock down the other half right there's advantages.

286
00:24:47,072 --> 00:24:56,599
HAB-Michael Lecceserer-Moderator): I think to size that I haven't heard discussed yet, but I wanted to bring up in case others have thought about it or have feedback yeah I would say.

287
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:05,002
That is definitely going to be something that is considered, especially when the architect is brought on, because they will be able to analyze what spaces you have right now.

288
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:11,824
How that, how that applies against that guidelines and see how much space you need.

289
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:19,906
And then obviously discussions with the school on what spaces would be to stay in a phased construction situation like that.

290
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:21,507
In theory.

291
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:28,792
very possible to move kids around a building and either renovate or tear it down and build.

292
00:25:29,492 --> 00:25:34,074
That's all going to be something that we discuss during the logistics and phasing discussions.

293
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:43,037
Definitely later in the project, but we'll have a better idea of what's going on about what your space looks like versus what you should have.

294
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:46,458
Great.

295
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,539
One last question.

296
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:51,280
I promised we would take till 830.

297
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:54,083
I have to do that.

298
00:25:54,644 --> 00:25:59,407
Alumni feel that all night.

299
00:25:59,747 --> 00:26:02,429
It's not the one that's.

300
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,173
That one, I don't describe it.

301
00:26:09,894 --> 00:26:11,435
Oh, that's just property.

302
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:11,835
Sorry.

303
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:12,836
I think it's also.

304
00:26:12,896 --> 00:26:13,236
OK, sorry.

305
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:38,971
So I think I'm hearing that we might want to make a motion to request that OPM do a simple analysis of available properties.

306
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:39,652
Yeah.

307
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:41,772
Is there somebody who wants to make that motion?

308
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:42,592
Luke?

309
00:26:42,672 --> 00:26:47,793
I make a motion that Westfield form appear due of prior service.

310
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:48,593
Great.

311
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:49,554
And is there a second?

312
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,074
Seconded by Libby.

313
00:26:52,454 --> 00:26:53,255
Okay.

314
00:26:53,775 --> 00:26:54,635
Well, I'll call the roll.

315
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:55,255
Jenny Graham.

316
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:55,596
Yeah.

317
00:26:55,736 --> 00:26:56,676
Mayor Lungo Kern.

318
00:26:58,837 --> 00:26:59,157
Yes.

319
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:01,078
Dr. Pelosi.

320
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:01,738
Yes.

321
00:27:01,938 --> 00:27:02,699
Dr. Pushing.

322
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:03,699
Yes.

323
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,560
All right.

324
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,741
Yeah.

325
00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:08,241
Yes.

326
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:09,342
Yes.

327
00:27:10,322 --> 00:27:11,002
Brian Dorsey.

328
00:27:11,222 --> 00:27:11,482
Yes.

329
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:12,943
Brian Hilliard.

330
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:13,443
Yes.

331
00:27:13,944 --> 00:27:14,964
Tracy King.

332
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:18,445
Emily Lazaro said no.

333
00:27:18,686 --> 00:27:19,106
Yeah.

334
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:23,403
No, this is about to continue looking at other spaces.

335
00:27:23,623 --> 00:27:33,427
To have left field do a cursory look at the other spaces available and create a chart for us.

336
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:38,069
Create the chart about the spaces that we looked at and why we decided that.

337
00:27:38,889 --> 00:27:40,449
Sorry, Aaron's surprised, but he did it wrong.

338
00:27:40,489 --> 00:27:40,710
Sorry.

339
00:27:45,784 --> 00:27:56,955
So I think to clarify, my intent is that we can do this quickly-ish, and we can still take things off the table officially before it becomes something we're going to spend money on in the design study.

340
00:28:10,813 --> 00:28:12,034
and the feasibility study.

341
00:28:12,114 --> 00:28:14,016
So yes to both.

342
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:14,537
Nicole Morrell.

343
00:28:14,737 --> 00:28:14,937
Yes.

344
00:28:14,957 --> 00:28:15,558
Aaron Lopate.

345
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:16,098
And Joe Bowen.

346
00:28:16,138 --> 00:28:16,499
Yes.

347
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:20,883
15 in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

348
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:37,312
Yes, well, sure, it was Luke.

349
00:28:37,332 --> 00:28:39,793
It was a motion to do a peer review of available spaces at that part.

350
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:44,874
There is a form of peer review of the city's prior study available spaces.

351
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:08,392
Okay, moving on.

352
00:29:08,532 --> 00:29:15,318
So the left field team has an update for us about the designer selection panel and the next steps.

353
00:29:15,498 --> 00:29:28,188
So we did officially get the green light to bring left field on board, we've signed the contract, all that was done in record time, thanks to the mayor's office.

354
00:29:29,089 --> 00:29:31,671
And we're like,

355
00:29:32,307 --> 00:29:35,249
eager and ready to go, and we have some updates about what's next.

356
00:29:35,529 --> 00:29:38,931
So I'm going to turn it over into the left field.

357
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:40,192
Can you go to the next slide?

358
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:40,412
Yeah.

359
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,313
All right.

360
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:45,976
So this was the same schedule that we showed at our last meeting.

361
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:52,420
Over on the left, far left, the designer selection are the only dates that have been updated.

362
00:29:53,441 --> 00:30:00,185
We had been hopeful that we would be able to push out the design RFS very quickly after being brought on board officially.

363
00:30:01,116 --> 00:30:07,101
uh, after the, uh, MSBA OPM panel and talking with the MSBA, they were not fond of that idea.

364
00:30:07,321 --> 00:30:13,686
And just based on how many projects that they currently have, um, they're, they're backed up essentially.

365
00:30:13,746 --> 00:30:18,330
They're just having a hard time kind of keeping up with getting all of the projects through the process.

366
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:26,536
So, um, they did unfortunately push us out to the, uh, August, uh, I'm sorry, uh, September.

367
00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:33,877
Yeah, September 23rd and October 7th.

368
00:30:33,897 --> 00:30:40,740
So we were hoping to get on the August designer selection panel meetings.

369
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:47,262
July was going to be tough to me, but we definitely could get on August.

370
00:30:47,442 --> 00:30:52,123
It's certainly something that we're capable of doing and have the time to do it.

371
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:56,745
But we are kind of at the MSBA's mercy when it comes to their schedule.

372
00:30:58,248 --> 00:31:01,910
So their designer selection panels until the end of September were completely full.

373
00:31:04,891 --> 00:31:12,013
We didn't tell them that if anything changes to let us know, we'll be ready to move at a moment's notice, but they do not foresee that happening.

374
00:31:12,694 --> 00:31:19,056
So the dates that you see there, what they sent us, they were very specific in their email that these dates cannot change.

375
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:21,017
So they have heard us pushing.

376
00:31:22,773 --> 00:31:26,616
And it just wasn't as successful as we were hoping.

377
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:31,659
That being said, that gives us quite a bit of time between now and getting a designer on board.

378
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,700
So we want to be really proactive in what we're doing.

379
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:43,166
I think this site discussion was perfect because that's definitely something that we're able to do and take on and get ahead of something that the designer would typically do.

380
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:51,852
But given the kind of the case that we have here, I think it should be pretty simple and good for us to kind of get a head start on that.

381
00:31:52,698 --> 00:31:57,620
Uh, we also want to really dive into the educational program and I'll let Jen talk on this a little bit.

382
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:21,548
Um, but that's something as well that we want to start working with the, with the school on, uh, get their educational program, start to look at it, start to put it into some of the MSBAs space summaries that will tell us, you know, school size and just start doing some of that legwork so that when we do get the designer on board, they kind of already have a really good starting point and don't have to kind of go back and do some of this stuff.

383
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:21,728
So.

384
00:32:22,456 --> 00:32:24,998
trying to maintain as much of the schedule as we can.

385
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:29,600
All the other dates and the feasibility schematic and funding the project have not changed.

386
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:39,146
We are confident that we can still hit the January 2026 submission of the PDP, which is the Preliminary Design Program.

387
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,527
That's the first big MSBA submission.

388
00:32:42,368 --> 00:32:44,669
So we had been planning, originally scheduled

389
00:32:56,893 --> 00:33:05,382
stuff and hopefully get a signer on board that's willing to really work with us on kind of these expedited submissions.

390
00:33:07,164 --> 00:33:09,306
Do you want to just talk on the ed plan quick?

391
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:10,026
Absolutely.

392
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:13,690
So as Matt summarized, we are

393
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:19,316
looking to move full speed ahead with that educational program.

394
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:27,860
So that, to bring everybody up to speed, what that is, the educational program is really, it's what the design of your building is based on.

395
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:45,308
So it is a layout of what programs you have now, or once the schools are officially combined their schedules next year, it'll lay out that program, and then also the future hopes and goals for the school.

396
00:33:46,283 --> 00:33:56,870
And that is what the designer will take and they'll tell you how many spaces you need to achieve those goals and keep those programs or expand programs, add programs.

397
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:06,797
So we're going to start working with Dr. Glucy and your team and try to get a good draft of that going by the time we have the designer on.

398
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:09,979
I would say 95% of it should be complete by then.

399
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,242
We've sent over some today, I've sent over some

400
00:34:15,135 --> 00:34:17,779
Yes, it's very long email.

401
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,306
So yeah, wait, Jen.

402
00:34:22,446 --> 00:34:28,775
Some examples from other schools, from similar schools, from other MSBA projects of ours that have

403
00:34:30,738 --> 00:34:36,062
Received praise, so things to look out for things to consider when we're.

404
00:34:36,502 --> 00:34:40,825
Putting together and the district's putting together the plan for the project.

405
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:47,770
The 1st draft of that is due with that 1st, January submission, the PDP, the preliminary design program.

406
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:54,574
That that point, the school committee will have signed off and then this group will sign off as it.

407
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:58,397
Is part of the package that goes to the MSBA.

408
00:34:59,648 --> 00:35:01,949
And then that's, again, just a draft.

409
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:08,932
So at that point, you'll still have the whole next phase, the preferred schematic report phase.

410
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:25,099
As you're narrowing down to a single preferred solution for the building, you'll have time to edit that plan based on feedback we've heard from the NSBA at that point, based on things that the OPM, the design team, everybody is taking a look at it.

411
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:27,700
So there will be time to edit it,

412
00:35:28,237 --> 00:35:30,278
until next June, I believe.

413
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:32,179
But we're starting the process now.

414
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:35,880
I think we can make some really good headway on it between now and bringing the design team on.

415
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,701
Handing that to them will save a ton of time.

416
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:43,963
And I think that we're going to hit the ground running.

417
00:35:44,284 --> 00:35:48,725
Yeah, we want to keep things moving.

418
00:35:49,546 --> 00:35:52,707
Any questions on either design or selection

419
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:02,939
You have a few slides on designer selection.

420
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:19,054
I believe we've kind of eliminated the July building committee meeting right now just because of the time that we have, but we'll meet in August and we'll go through a much more detailed kind of how to go about the proposals.

421
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:26,180
But we did want to give just a quick overview of kind of the major steps that we'll be taking.

422
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:38,740
And just for all of you to know that has proposed meeting scheduled for us for the next year so that we can have a standing schedule and.

423
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:46,446
I will pass this off to to Lisa to ask her to schedule calendar holds for you all.

424
00:36:47,337 --> 00:36:56,700
In general, we try to stick to Monday night, but like, every holiday is on Monday and we have school committee to 2 meetings a month.

425
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,981
So on the on those weeks where we had to have a meeting.

426
00:37:00,722 --> 00:37:05,863
Um, or those months where we had to have a meeting and there wasn't a Monday, it's generally like a Wednesday.

427
00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:06,584
So that's.

428
00:37:07,104 --> 00:37:09,525
Roughly what we're going to try to hold to, but.

429
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:15,827
I will ask Lisa to send this full list out to you all as well as a list of.

430
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:18,615
a calendar, a list of calendars.

431
00:37:23,177 --> 00:37:42,601
Yeah, so just quickly on the designer selection overview, important concepts is, you know, we've already submitted the design RFS to the MSBA, so they're already reviewing it, and we have, you know, all of the major aspects of this project described in it, very similar to the OPM RFS that you had issued previously.

432
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:46,142
We'll be advertising at the end of June,

433
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:50,318
what the MSBA is anticipating.

434
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:52,539
We can advertise earlier.

435
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:57,322
I just don't think it's going to necessarily buy us anything in the MSBA world.

436
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:06,107
If we get the review of the RFS back from the MSBA and we want to advertise for six weeks instead of four, that's fine.

437
00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:08,608
That just gives the designers more time to look at it.

438
00:38:09,088 --> 00:38:11,169
But we can talk about that when we get there.

439
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:23,217
Once we advertise, interested designers will submit their proposals, both kind of their master file brochure and their application.

440
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:35,587
After we receive all of those, we'll submit them to MS&AB for their review, and then this committee or a smaller subcommittee will also start to review the

441
00:38:43,618 --> 00:38:45,039
the most beneficial for the project.

442
00:38:46,919 --> 00:38:53,622
It's important to remember that the designer RFS and the designer review is all qualification based.

443
00:38:53,682 --> 00:38:56,623
It is not based on dollars and cents.

444
00:38:57,204 --> 00:39:01,285
So it's if we look at it strictly from a qualification standpoint.

445
00:39:01,825 --> 00:39:09,368
It's not until after you select the designer that you can go into the negotiation similar to what we did with the OPM.

446
00:39:09,408 --> 00:39:09,569
So

447
00:39:12,358 --> 00:39:16,081
just keep that in mind as you start to review the proposals.

448
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:17,582
It's all based on qualifications.

449
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:22,607
The designer selection panel meetings, like we said, are end of September, first week of August.

450
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:27,351
The first meeting of the DSP is to review the proposals.

451
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:38,980
The MSBA will typically ask, you know, who your top three or four firms are, and then those three firms will be interviewed at the following meeting on the first week of August.

452
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:48,535
And then at that meeting, you'll rank your designers from 1 through 3, 4, however many you have.

453
00:39:49,575 --> 00:39:59,862
And if the designer selection panel all agrees, you'll go into negotiations with your top-ranked firm and hopefully reach an agreement with them.

454
00:40:00,162 --> 00:40:01,363
Can I ask a quick question on that?

455
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:02,604
Yeah.

456
00:40:05,606 --> 00:40:09,248
When we were selecting an LPM, Brady really had it

457
00:40:11,696 --> 00:40:18,140
was unanimous but it wasn't like you were like three times the points as the next person.

458
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:30,126
Does that seem kind of like is the number one usually a little ahead of the number two or is it like typical for number one to be like so far ahead that there's no conversation?

459
00:40:31,187 --> 00:40:33,928
No, I think they're usually pretty close.

460
00:40:33,968 --> 00:40:35,669
It definitely varies from project to project.

461
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:37,470
I think we'll get a lot of interest on

462
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:44,977
in rankings.

463
00:40:44,997 --> 00:40:50,959
Yeah, I don't think super common is one that's like way far ahead.

464
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:53,159
I could just add to that a little bit.

465
00:40:53,199 --> 00:41:02,761
We'll talk about the makeup of the designer selection panel, because the group that has the ultimate say is unfortunately not this group here at the table.

466
00:41:04,081 --> 00:41:11,303
There is a designer selection panel that is mostly made up of MSBA and state designated committee members.

467
00:41:12,255 --> 00:41:18,420
We will have 3 people at that scene and then the ranking happens with all that group.

468
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:19,281
So.

469
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:23,725
I've seen things where there is the 1st, 3 ranked.

470
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:29,009
Highest usually the last to do the 2nd, 2nd meetings.

471
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:37,957
And then the 4th is like a far drop off based on where the conversation is headed with the DSP and all.

472
00:41:39,078 --> 00:41:40,299
It really does vary, but.

473
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,864
But it won't just be this group, unfortunately.

474
00:41:44,964 --> 00:41:48,007
Yeah, and actually, if you go to the next slide.

475
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:52,872
Yeah, so this is exactly what Jen was just talking about.

476
00:41:52,972 --> 00:42:00,179
It's the 13 members appointed by the executive director of the MSBA and then 3 members from the city.

477
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,423
The 3 members are listed there, the mayor, the superintendent of schools.

478
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:34,367
We will have lots of meetings with everyone to make sure that we're reviewing and what's important and things that this group finds important that should be brought forth to the larger DSP committees so that they hear some of the local thoughts and concerns from the review.

479
00:42:37,098 --> 00:42:39,840
Will you be part of that DSP process like in the room?

480
00:42:41,181 --> 00:42:44,343
We'll be in the room, but we can't, we won't say anything.

481
00:42:44,463 --> 00:42:45,604
It's a Zoom meeting, so yeah.

482
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:47,345
It's being recorded, I can't see.

483
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:53,349
But before the three members of the, from this committee go to the DSP, you'll have a really

484
00:43:09,055 --> 00:43:11,857
of your kind of leaning towards, or at least your top three.

485
00:43:13,278 --> 00:43:20,983
As you start to look and kind of get familiar with how the proposals are laid out, they're all going to be fairly similar in terms of how they're laid out.

486
00:43:21,443 --> 00:43:29,649
So you'll be able to really compare each of the proposals to each other and say, okay, this one definitely speaks way more about CDE.

487
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:32,610
Like this architect has never done CDE programs.

488
00:43:32,951 --> 00:43:34,912
That type of stuff, like you'll start to really

489
00:43:36,523 --> 00:43:45,125
you know, shift towards one or two architects just by looking at how to, you know, stop making your own decisions.

490
00:43:45,185 --> 00:43:47,466
So.

491
00:43:48,926 --> 00:44:00,729
So that I understand this, the MSBA chooses 13 people from wherever, like from a different, what?

492
00:44:01,009 --> 00:44:01,349
They choose 10.

493
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,429
Oh, okay.

494
00:44:02,629 --> 00:44:04,570
So they choose 10 people, but they're not from here?

495
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:14,260
They're just from wherever they are, so there are a standing committee.

496
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:14,720
Okay.

497
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:20,304
So it's they do they have the 10 people and they have 13 and we get.

498
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:23,127
Oh, yeah, that's true.

499
00:44:23,147 --> 00:44:23,367
Yes.

500
00:44:23,847 --> 00:44:24,608
Yeah.

501
00:44:24,668 --> 00:44:24,868
Yes.

502
00:44:26,209 --> 00:44:27,130
There's just so many of them.

503
00:44:28,271 --> 00:44:30,052
But they have 13 that are appointed.

504
00:44:30,112 --> 00:44:30,653
There are.

505
00:44:31,494 --> 00:44:34,296
Architects, engineers, people in the building industry.

506
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:37,151
MSBA folks.

507
00:44:37,371 --> 00:44:39,792
What makes them not choose people that they're friends with?

508
00:44:39,812 --> 00:44:40,872
This is so frustrating.

509
00:44:41,152 --> 00:44:42,293
What makes them not choose people?

510
00:44:42,593 --> 00:44:43,493
I don't know.

511
00:44:43,713 --> 00:44:44,034
Whatever.

512
00:44:44,094 --> 00:44:47,395
I can't fight this right now.

513
00:44:47,535 --> 00:44:49,036
This is the way the game is.

514
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:50,316
This is the way it's played.

515
00:44:50,376 --> 00:45:03,522
But I think the point, their goal from an MSBA perspective is that there are people in industry weighing in on, practically speaking, what needs to happen in these design studies because

516
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:09,012
they have a really prescriptive way that they want case design studies completed, right?

517
00:45:09,072 --> 00:45:10,052
So, yeah.

518
00:45:10,132 --> 00:45:19,279
And the other thing that I heard, I think it might've been one of you all from that field, is that, look, they're paying for half of this building.

519
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,140
Right.

520
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:25,664
So they should probably have a say.

521
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:26,584
So, you know,

522
00:45:32,046 --> 00:45:39,849
I mean, the mayor, the superintendent of schools, and whoever we appoint to the school committee can all likely, zero of them will know anything about building a high school.

523
00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:40,449
No, totally.

524
00:45:40,489 --> 00:45:44,430
But they'll know everything about Medford and what our school district is.

525
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:50,332
But I assume the other 13 members will all have, literally, this is their career.

526
00:45:51,212 --> 00:45:58,275
So if I was the person writing half the check for this, I would not want it to be just elected people.

527
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:09,547
one person who's got a doctorate in education deciding anything about the core of who's capable of actually designing this building.

528
00:46:09,987 --> 00:46:12,768
Because honestly, I wouldn't know.

529
00:46:13,328 --> 00:46:15,750
I mean, I would look at their website.

530
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,270
I'd be like, oh, yeah, they're all great.

531
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,031
They've done another building.

532
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:19,791
Seems good.

533
00:46:19,851 --> 00:46:20,412
Yeah.

534
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:20,672
Yeah.

535
00:46:20,832 --> 00:46:21,592
So all right.

536
00:46:21,712 --> 00:46:22,833
My take on that?

537
00:46:22,853 --> 00:46:23,713
We can't change it.

538
00:46:27,433 --> 00:46:28,053
Let's pick her.

539
00:46:28,194 --> 00:46:28,634
Yeah.

540
00:46:29,054 --> 00:46:31,236
Let me just make sure I understand everything you said.

541
00:46:31,296 --> 00:46:34,558
So we will all get to look at the proposals ourselves.

542
00:46:35,098 --> 00:46:39,762
So while we only have three seats, we get to talk about the concerns of Medford.

543
00:46:40,162 --> 00:46:46,707
They're just gonna make sure that they're qualified to do the job and they haven't gotten like all the high school projects in the last year and have a monopoly on those projects.

544
00:46:47,287 --> 00:46:50,249
But we all get to look at them and give our thoughts in this forum.

545
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:50,650
Yeah.

546
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,131
I think that's, I think it'll be fine.

547
00:46:53,472 --> 00:46:53,712
Yeah.

548
00:46:53,832 --> 00:46:54,032
Yeah.

549
00:46:54,072 --> 00:46:55,393
We'll have, we'll, we'll have

550
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:23,558
know, evaluation spreadsheets where, you know, everybody goes through and kind of gives rankings of, you know, which one required, uh, third section of the proposal, uh, so that, yeah, we can have a good conversation with this committee and then, you know, that informs the opinion of the committee members, you know, so.

551
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:29,623
And I will say, uh, the reason they have the FAIR, the superintendent school committee member on

552
00:47:30,203 --> 00:47:38,367
as the three members, they really do listen, they do listen to the community and the concerns of those three members.

553
00:47:38,928 --> 00:47:54,455
And I think that making sure that the concerns, the thoughts are really prepared in advance and unified, and make sure that they really hear what the desires of your community are.

554
00:47:55,496 --> 00:47:59,338
That usually, that really... Yeah, the three members do hold a lot of weight.

555
00:48:04,835 --> 00:48:19,026
you're going in with stuff to say, you know, really vouching for, you know, certain parts of a proposal that you like, because the MSBA does, you know, the DSP does listen to the three members, because you are the experts of the town.

556
00:48:19,086 --> 00:48:28,754
So, you know, they are, like Libby said, taking a look at, you know, how much work do each of the architectural firms have, and stuff like that.

557
00:48:28,994 --> 00:48:33,598
So, I'm assuming there'll be quickness coaching going on ahead of time.

558
00:48:34,622 --> 00:48:36,243
the three folks we sent over, right?

559
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:40,104
Like that you all will be really working them up till they know.

560
00:48:40,124 --> 00:48:42,205
We're not gonna talk about that.

561
00:48:42,525 --> 00:48:43,285
Okay, go.

562
00:48:43,585 --> 00:48:50,207
Well, I just like, I'm assuming each of these three people will have never been to this kind of a thing before.

563
00:48:50,407 --> 00:48:51,348
We can attend.

564
00:48:51,548 --> 00:48:53,148
We can attend somebody else's DSV.

565
00:48:53,368 --> 00:48:53,989
Oh, we should do that.

566
00:48:54,149 --> 00:48:54,609
Yeah.

567
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:55,809
Thank you.

568
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:56,650
I just have to register.

569
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:02,252
The main goal for them is that they want to keep it fair, right?

570
00:49:02,292 --> 00:49:03,532
They say you can have

571
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:09,532
your opinions when they ask that the team members don't come into the DSP meeting with a break.

572
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:11,453
That's their key.

573
00:49:11,813 --> 00:49:27,580
So you have three design firms that you think three or four or five that have listened to the talk, but you're not supposed to go into the DSP and say, I want architectural firm B as number one, and then architectural firm number two.

574
00:49:28,701 --> 00:49:32,383
That you're not supposed to coach

575
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:46,634
I said several things and I have nothing to say.

576
00:49:47,214 --> 00:49:50,595
Any questions about the DSD?

577
00:49:50,715 --> 00:50:04,877
Actually, if you go to the next slide, I think we've kind of already, you know, kind of touched on this, but, you know, it's based on qualifications and these are all of the kind of categories that we're looking at.

578
00:50:05,788 --> 00:50:15,013
that the architects need to submit their proposal, kind of pandering it and highlighting their experience and their financial stability.

579
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:18,674
They need to prove that they can financially do a project of this size.

580
00:50:18,694 --> 00:50:32,481
But yeah, so it's a pretty set process on kind of what each of the proposals look like.

581
00:50:32,861 --> 00:50:34,842
So all proposals will essentially

582
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:39,891
like I said, the same in covering these criteria here.

583
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:48,917
I think there's one more, but I think it's just, yeah, so this is what Jenny is going to send over with some of the meeting dates.

584
00:50:50,898 --> 00:50:54,640
The highlights in blue are for the designer selection process.

585
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:02,385
Those are the four key dates that we're looking at right now, the issuing of the RFS on July 30th.

586
00:51:03,005 --> 00:51:04,746
A month later, proposals will be due.

587
00:51:09,163 --> 00:51:14,248
before we get to our first DSP meeting on September 23rd.

588
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:23,636
And then on the far right side, the highlight in red is our first MSBA submission, the PDP submission.

589
00:51:24,156 --> 00:51:30,702
That's kind of the first critical milestone once we get the designer on board.

590
00:51:32,643 --> 00:51:33,724
So I have a question.

591
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:48,746
I see MSBA first appear in late January, but at least in my understanding of what's discussed or what has been discussed, did they make an appearance, you know, in the timeline much sooner, right?

592
00:51:49,226 --> 00:51:49,626
Yeah.

593
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:50,667
Sometime in September.

594
00:51:50,927 --> 00:51:51,888
The DSP D-Day.

595
00:51:52,448 --> 00:51:52,788
Okay.

596
00:51:52,868 --> 00:51:54,329
Yeah.

597
00:51:54,429 --> 00:51:58,291
Could you just flag for me where MSBA would start appearing?

598
00:51:58,331 --> 00:51:59,312
Would it be the 23rd?

599
00:51:59,972 --> 00:52:03,254
Every time I see DSP, does that also mean MSBA?

600
00:52:03,836 --> 00:52:07,877
Yeah, Designer Selection Panel is MSPA.

601
00:52:07,977 --> 00:52:08,877
Okay, thank you.

602
00:52:08,957 --> 00:52:12,538
I can put an MSPA next to that, just so it's clear.

603
00:52:12,818 --> 00:52:16,539
But yeah, those are the two, Designer Selection Panel and MSPA meetings.

604
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:16,799
Okay.

605
00:52:17,139 --> 00:52:24,200
And then after that, we won't talk to them a whole lot until we submit the first submission.

606
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:32,342
All right.

607
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:42,405
Do you guys have like a modified timeline there when you might do the site walkthrough?

608
00:52:42,725 --> 00:52:45,466
Oh, in the RFS, if that's what you mean.

609
00:52:45,946 --> 00:52:47,727
We haven't recast that yet.

610
00:52:47,887 --> 00:52:49,067
It's like on the to-do list.

611
00:52:49,087 --> 00:52:51,008
We can send it to you as soon as we're done.

612
00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:53,369
And you're welcome to join us.

613
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:54,249
Yeah, that's always fun.

614
00:52:54,369 --> 00:52:54,670
Yeah.

615
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:59,452
Yeah, we have plenty of time to do a walkthrough.

616
00:52:59,672 --> 00:53:02,173
I figure it's what office is pushing.

617
00:53:02,193 --> 00:53:02,413
Yes.

618
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:08,612
Other questions?

619
00:53:10,432 --> 00:53:20,535
Of those dates that this committee meets, are there dates that we have to make significant votes that you want to make sure we have before?

620
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:22,495
Yes, we can flag those.

621
00:53:24,996 --> 00:53:29,257
So far, we haven't had a war problem, but this is a marathon, not a sprint.

622
00:53:29,297 --> 00:53:29,597
I get that.

623
00:53:29,617 --> 00:53:30,297
Without any of that.

624
00:53:36,143 --> 00:53:38,105
Any other questions?

625
00:53:38,145 --> 00:53:43,989
Is there a motion to adjourn?

626
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:55,598
The only question that I did have, and it's probably a little early, but just hearing kind of, you know, concerns tonight just about making sure the public is informed.

627
00:53:56,218 --> 00:54:04,845
Does it make sense to try to schedule a community forum of sorts where, you know, we're introduced and we start to explain the process because I've always found that, like,

628
00:54:05,502 --> 00:54:08,383
that's always, you know, people won't pay attention.

629
00:54:08,863 --> 00:54:16,104
And then when they, you know, start to ask questions, it's like, well, we've been doing this for six months and like, this is how it goes.

630
00:54:16,164 --> 00:54:30,386
And I think like just trying to drill process into like everybody's mind helps, you know, along the way so that when we do get to a vote, you know, people are aware like, yeah, this has been ongoing for quite a while.

631
00:54:31,887 --> 00:54:32,547
So I'm always,

632
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:35,431
That's a great question.

633
00:54:35,451 --> 00:54:44,955
I think one thought that I have is that that's like a September thing, because I think we will lack engagement in the summer.

634
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:55,099
But I would be curious what you all think about that time, whether you think there would be significant engagement in summer for community meetings.

635
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,021
I would agree with September.

636
00:54:58,141 --> 00:54:59,201
Yeah.

637
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:02,923
And when they get the blood bill time to do

638
00:55:03,737 --> 00:55:06,139
that work in terms of the site, why don't you use that?

639
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:11,584
Because that would be one of the first questions that I would think the community would say, well, why aren't you choosing X, Y, and Z?

640
00:55:11,764 --> 00:55:12,865
So yeah.

641
00:55:12,905 --> 00:55:14,186
Yeah, that's a great point.

642
00:55:15,027 --> 00:55:26,436
To build on that too, it might be a good time for us to start talking about project website, maybe have that out, because I know there's an interest on the school side and the student side.

643
00:55:27,137 --> 00:55:29,459
That could be something that we, in parallel,

644
00:55:29,738 --> 00:55:34,441
work on during the summer, which I can help take the lead on to get that going in the background.

645
00:55:34,521 --> 00:55:49,009
So maybe if everybody agrees that September sounds like a good time based on history of other projects, it's the summertime, it's digital at best, and we won't have much information.

646
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:56,614
I feel like we might sort of lose interest if we don't have enough quality information to give them, but if we sort of

647
00:55:57,257 --> 00:56:00,080
do a soft rollout of the project by that time.

648
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:12,030
We're in the process of getting the designer on board, done the site selections, have the website ready to go online, kind of make it a little bit more of an event, if you will, to the public.

649
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:13,631
Sure.

650
00:56:13,852 --> 00:56:15,293
Thank you.

651
00:56:15,493 --> 00:56:22,339
So I like that a lot because also at least school committee members, I don't know if everybody can get those requests, but

652
00:56:23,992 --> 00:56:33,098
we're gonna get asked these questions long before September, you know, just in an email here or there and hold that till September is not a really satisfying response.

653
00:56:34,499 --> 00:56:37,801
The other thing though, this is something about the website.

654
00:56:39,922 --> 00:56:48,148
During this whole process I have reviewed school building project websites, there seems to be a consistent thing that's missing.

655
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,930
And that is that the websites seem to always represent

656
00:56:53,828 --> 00:57:06,274
And when we're looking at how did this all play out, there's like getting understanding the entire process starting at the beginning from a school building website seems to be absolutely up to date.

657
00:57:06,294 --> 00:57:09,136
So I don't even know what that's looking like.

658
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:15,159
Like you can find the timeline, but like the timeline we just saw is what you can find.

659
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:22,823
And I'm just thinking, is there a way we can like sort of pay it forward a little for other place, other building committees in the future,

660
00:57:23,616 --> 00:57:24,237
How do they do that?

661
00:57:24,257 --> 00:57:25,117
How do they do that?

662
00:57:25,618 --> 00:57:28,560
And they're always asking those questions about the early phases.

663
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:34,365
And we're going to all forget very much about this phase when we have shovels in the ground.

664
00:57:34,445 --> 00:57:36,887
We're going to be like, oh, that was so long ago for peers.

665
00:57:37,447 --> 00:57:42,631
So that's just something to think about when working on the website is like, it isn't just for the community now.

666
00:57:42,691 --> 00:57:51,378
In my mind, it should be to help other school committees and school building committees in the future be able to like, they're going to come in

667
00:57:52,062 --> 00:57:55,503
for the most part, probably ignorant of the whole process, all nine yards.

668
00:57:56,264 --> 00:58:02,586
And I mean, I've seen some really nice websites, but I cannot get that, because they're all at the end.

669
00:58:03,886 --> 00:58:08,648
And nobody looking at them from the outside is ever at the end.

670
00:58:08,668 --> 00:58:09,628
They're always at the end.

671
00:58:10,229 --> 00:58:14,670
So we did some examples of project websites.

672
00:58:17,123 --> 00:58:23,208
as sort of a standard for all of our projects.

673
00:58:23,968 --> 00:58:33,796
And one piece of that is the schedule, which talks about different modules that you have and expand on that very much.

674
00:58:33,816 --> 00:58:43,423
I think that the difficulty that we have with sort of forecasting too much is that there's time and place to give out information to the public.

675
00:58:43,443 --> 00:58:45,445
You don't want to rush it and have people

676
00:58:46,004 --> 00:58:57,494
jump to conclusions too much because the minute we say one thing, they're going to lean on that, they're going to hold on to that for dear life for the next seven years and I'm stuck with it.

677
00:58:58,135 --> 00:59:08,684
So I think one of the ways that we've sort of solved that issue a little bit with our websites is we call them fact-based

678
00:59:09,623 --> 00:59:11,704
They're not flashy, but they're fact-based.

679
00:59:11,824 --> 00:59:14,445
So that way you can certainly explain the fact.

680
00:59:14,465 --> 00:59:15,846
So here's the process.

681
00:59:16,026 --> 00:59:19,928
Just don't want to go into specific details of this project.

682
00:59:20,388 --> 00:59:24,791
Until it's ready to be primed time, right?

683
00:59:24,831 --> 00:59:35,196
Because there's a time and a place and we'll be found when it comes to getting projects through the process and through both the votes and

684
00:59:36,508 --> 00:59:47,872
getting the towns and districts to agree on something is by giving them the facts in the order of which they are actual facts and actually given.

685
00:59:47,892 --> 00:59:56,775
Because if we start jumping the gun and say something that's later on going to change, that seems to be the kiss of death of the project.

686
00:59:56,835 --> 01:00:04,297
If you say it's going to cost $150 million one day, and then three weeks later, oh, actually, it's $145, doesn't matter if it was up or down.

687
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:05,997
really different.

688
01:00:06,317 --> 01:00:27,614
That's the, that's the one key thing that we kind of have to, we want to make sure that we sort of go through the process so that it's always based on the educational needs of the school, making sure that we're getting the most out of the MSBA's reimbursement process and all those parts and pieces that we're going to guide you through, making sure it's the right size.

689
01:00:27,654 --> 01:00:29,656
It's the right built and everything is right sized.

690
01:00:30,538 --> 01:00:34,180
Then we start getting into the type of conversations about what is it going to cost?

691
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,260
How will that go?

692
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:39,102
And all those parts and pieces then come through.

693
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:43,505
All of this is all going to come in different pieces and at different phases.

694
01:00:43,645 --> 01:00:47,967
But we definitely want to make sure that the information goes out to the public.

695
01:00:48,507 --> 01:00:54,570
But we also want to make sure that we spoon feed it, what we have, the facts, what we know for sure.

696
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:57,732
We have a backup for everything.

697
01:00:58,985 --> 01:01:06,007
So Linda, maybe you and Will can connect because Will has been maintaining our site so far.

698
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:12,608
And then perhaps can work with Will for like another iteration of the site.

699
01:01:12,628 --> 01:01:15,989
Maybe we can look at that at our next meeting.

700
01:01:16,369 --> 01:01:20,710
And then we can sort of tell you what we think and what we think will resonate.

701
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:22,106
have to do it at that.

702
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:22,426
Can I?

703
01:01:22,546 --> 01:01:23,147
Yeah, okay.

704
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:24,047
Does that work well?

705
01:01:24,287 --> 01:01:24,868
Yeah, absolutely.

706
01:01:24,948 --> 01:01:28,931
I know speaking with Lisa, she's also part of the team on that process as well, so.

707
01:01:29,892 --> 01:01:34,396
We have to bump our heads together and work on that.

708
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:35,677
Okay, great.

709
01:01:36,317 --> 01:01:50,889
Before we adjourn, Jenny, just, and we think about when we talk about the September community meeting, that parents, September and May are really our crunch time, and so if we can

710
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,962
delay as much into September and get out into the schools.

711
01:01:55,322 --> 01:02:00,644
I think about the parents that constituent, there's going to be the community of people, how much is it going to cost?

712
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:05,626
And then they're going to be the community of concerned parents is where is my child going to go?

713
01:02:05,887 --> 01:02:06,127
Yeah.

714
01:02:06,147 --> 01:02:10,609
So I just, as you know, as a school, as a parent.

715
01:02:11,089 --> 01:02:11,729
Yeah.

716
01:02:11,749 --> 01:02:12,510
Yeah.

717
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:16,491
We can look at the district calendar and figure out like, where is there some space?

718
01:02:17,632 --> 01:02:17,932
Thank you.

719
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:30,865
So just following that conversation, I just wanted to express sort of my support for a fact-based website that serves as a guardrail to what would otherwise become a hype machine.

720
01:02:31,586 --> 01:02:36,608
A new high school, very large facility that plays such a big role in a community.

721
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:46,032
You know, the gossip around it, the excitement, the imagination, visionary, that's going to take on a life of its own, whether we like it or not.

722
01:02:47,225 --> 01:02:58,193
And so, you know, having a website that's fact-based, that's like a useful resource for people like myself who do a lot of research and want to see basic documents.

723
01:02:59,494 --> 01:03:06,439
It will be valuable because that'll act as a guardrail on what would otherwise be, you know, an explosive type mission.

724
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:08,080
Sure.

725
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:11,843
Any other questions?

726
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,525
Is there a motion to adjourn?

727
01:03:16,723 --> 01:03:22,327
by Emily, seconded by Nicole.

728
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,428
I will call the roll.

729
01:03:24,049 --> 01:03:24,609

730
01:03:24,649 --> 01:03:24,949

756
01:03:46,808 --> 01:03:47,415
And jump on.

757
01:03:47,577 --> 01:03:49,701
Yes, the affirmative, zero, the negative.

758
01:03:49,904 --> 01:03:50,369
Meeting is adjourned.
