00:00:00,981 --> 00:00:06,185
Okay, welcome to the Medford Community Development Board meeting of May 4, 2022.

2
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:07,526
My name is Andre LaRue.

3
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:11,229
I'm the chair of the board and I call the meeting to order.

4
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:18,434
Pursuant to Chapter 20 of the Acts of 2021, this hearing of the Medford Community Development Board will be conducted via remote means.

That's OCD at Medford-MA.gov or phone at 781-393-2480.

9
00:01:00,885 --> 00:01:14,617
We're gonna make a tweak to the agenda tonight since our Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability, Alicia Hunt needs to step away soon and we'd like her to be able to present this.

10
00:01:14,678 --> 00:01:20,863
So we're gonna move the reassessment of the linkage fee schedule item to the top.

11
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:26,068
Director Hunt, would you please present this item?

12
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:28,606
Great, thank you very much.

13
00:01:28,806 --> 00:01:29,567
Thank you this evening.

14
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:33,430
So linkage is a very unusual thing.

15
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:37,173
Medford is one of the few communities that does linkage.

16
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:38,494
We're all pretty familiar with it.

17
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:46,961
It's when there is a development project of certain size, fees are automatically assessed, community betterment fees.

18
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:51,385
And this was approved by an act of the legislature in 1989.

19
00:01:53,446 --> 00:02:00,030
And we have it in our zoning and we have trust that are set up through it and a lot of bunch of legal documents.

20
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:09,816
One of the things that was set up through that was the requirement that our linkage fees would be reviewed every three years by the Community Development Board.

21
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:15,079
The linkage fees have never been reviewed, or at least they have never been changed.

22
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:18,000
So we are still assessing the same.

23
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,781
I can't say they've never been reviewed.

24
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:20,742
They may have been reviewed.

25
00:02:21,162 --> 00:02:22,383
They've never been changed.

26
00:02:23,383 --> 00:02:25,304
the originally assessed ones.

27
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:30,646
So we actually have two simple proposals.

28
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:46,531
One that we would put out a scope of work to hire someone to do an assessment and make a recommendation to the city as to what linkage what a reasonable increment should be or what the linkage fees should be today.

29
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:53,395
And we have gotten some estimates on what that work could cost.

30
00:02:53,895 --> 00:02:56,696
And the difficulty is nobody does.

31
00:02:57,217 --> 00:03:02,480
There is somebody who's done linkage proposals to develop a new linkage program for communities.

32
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,623
But Boston is the only other community in Massachusetts that currently has linkage the same way we do.

33
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:12,025
So there aren't like, oh, consultants that do this all the time.

34
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:17,588
So we would write up a scope of work, put it out to bid, see how much it costs.

35
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:23,054
We would be doing this on behalf of the Community Development Board, so we'd like your permission to do that.

36
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:30,805
We feel like we would then need to make the final decisions on everything based on what those numbers come back to.

37
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:33,549
Our guess is somewhere between $10,000 and $70,000.

38
00:03:37,073 --> 00:03:45,322
We've, we got some estimates that were like $70,000 and that was, we believe, a scope of work to set up a linkage program for a community.

39
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:47,624
So it's got to be a lot, it's got to be less than that.

40
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:49,507
And it was $10,000 back in 1989 to originally set the fees.

41
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:02,446
Um, we believe that there are a number of different funds that we could use to pay for this work, including linkage itself was used back in 1989.

42
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,708
Um, and theoretically site plan review.

43
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:10,431
So once we actually know what the cost would be, we would then make a recommendation.

44
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:17,235
Um, if the decision was to use linkage fees, the spending of that money is actually approved by the linkage board.

45
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:20,497
Um, so that wouldn't need to come back to this board.

46
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:21,258
They would approve it.

47
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:26,468
And if it was site plan review, then we would consult with community development board.

48
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:39,396
But we thought that it would be appropriate to ask you all for permission to go attempt to hire somebody on behalf of you to evaluate and make a recommendation on setting linkage fees.

49
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:41,617
So that's, why don't I leave it at that?

50
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:42,798
That's the first piece.

51
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:45,540
If you have questions or discussion.

52
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:49,687
I have one question, Director Hunt.

53
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:57,942
So do you need to come back to this board once you have a more accurate proposal?

54
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:08,198
Well, my feeling is that if we decide that we want to use site plan review, so we could if you guys say, please don't actually engage somebody without talking to us, we could certainly do that.

55
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:16,585
Because this board meets monthly, it's going to take us a while to write the scope, it's going to take us a while to get it out to bid, we're not sure exactly what the timing will be.

56
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:26,965
You could choose to say if it's site plan review funds, it's money we control, then we need you to come back and discuss spending that money with us.

57
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:39,887
If you decide to use another funding source, then obviously you couldn't approve a funding source you don't control, but you could say whether or not you thought it was a good use of the city's resources.

58
00:05:40,947 --> 00:05:42,948
So I guess I'd say it's up to you.

59
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:48,709
I don't feel that we'd have to if we're not using money that isn't controlled by this board.

60
00:05:50,138 --> 00:05:58,241
would we have to specify the revenue source tonight, or would you, do you have a recommendation for us?

61
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,742
So I think that it depends.

62
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:16,907
We actually haven't had a chance to look recently at how much is in site plan review, because that feels like it would be a good source of funding for this, because that is money, it's fees that come in from site plan,

63
00:06:17,187 --> 00:06:17,747
the site plan review fund.

64
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:22,151
Um we don't know when linkage is assessed frequently when site plan like it's not a direct.

65
00:06:22,571 --> 00:06:28,877
It's a very the same projects are assessed that, um, so it seems like an appropriate source.

66
00:06:29,677 --> 00:06:30,258
But we don't.

67
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:30,798
We actually

68
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:41,768
That's sort of where linkage is much more flexible money.

69
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:46,292
Site plan review is really only used for peer reviews by this board.

70
00:06:46,712 --> 00:06:48,774
And we haven't done that in a long time, actually.

71
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:50,315
So there's probably a lot of money there.

72
00:06:50,456 --> 00:06:57,021
And it's probably useful for you to all know that we can hire peer reviews of things.

73
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:00,124
So does that help?

74
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:17,461
recommendation is for you guys to say you should write the scope, you should hire somebody to review linkage and come back to us with a recommendation to change linkage as long as it's not money that you need to also approve.

75
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:24,145
Do other board members have comments or questions?

76
00:07:32,257 --> 00:07:34,759
I guess I'm just kind of confused.

77
00:07:36,742 --> 00:07:49,015
And maybe Alicia maybe you said this and it just didn't sink in with me but isn't this just something that city council should be authorizing funds for I, I don't really see it coming from the board but again, if I missed it.

78
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,697
Sorry to make you say it again.

79
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,511
but it's different pots of money are different authorizations.

80
00:07:54,771 --> 00:08:01,432
So site plan review funds are set up for the community development board to use for peer reviews and for their things.

81
00:08:01,552 --> 00:08:05,433
And you don't have to go to city council to spend money in the site review fund.

82
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,234
Linkage is a board that's overseen.

83
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:14,495
Actually the board itself is the mayor, the city council president and the director of finance.

84
00:08:15,135 --> 00:08:23,900
So any request to spend linkage goes to that body and it's posted as a public meeting, but it does not go to the City Council as a whole.

85
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:35,788
If we were asking for free cash, we would go to the City Council, or it could be something we could ask for in our budget if we knew how much it was going to be.

86
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:39,630
We could ask for an increase to the budget and then the City Council would vote on it.

87
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:45,346
the City Council does not vote on how to spend site plan review money.

88
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:53,713
So it seems to me that we would be kind of voting on a, uh.

89
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:53,753
A

90
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:13,652
to evaluate, for a consultant to evaluate the linkage fee system that we have, or the schedule.

91
00:09:14,632 --> 00:09:29,177
And if there is, the funds are under our purview, I think we would need to sign off on that, which would be the site plan review funds.

92
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:39,134
It would be good, and certainly as a kind of a separate issue, it would be great, Director Hunt, if you could come back to us anyways and report to us on that fund.

93
00:09:39,154 --> 00:09:44,898
We've never kind of talked about it or how we might use it or how much money is in there.

94
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:48,601
Actually, I can see Amanda making a note.

95
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:57,547
We've actually been getting, we have a very excellent administrative assistant now who has access to the finance system, and we've been slowly adding

96
00:09:58,093 --> 00:10:01,454
the funds to which she has access to see and review.

97
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:14,599
So we'll actually see if that, we probably have to actually request to have her added to that one, but we should be able to do that and then just get our own report without having to go else.

98
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,062
Up until now, we've had to go elsewhere every time we want a finance report, but we're able to get those in-house now.

99
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:23,916
Yeah, that would be great.

100
00:10:24,016 --> 00:10:38,705
And actually, I feel like the right thing to do would be we would send you all the scope of work so that you could see it, we would tell you that it was posted, and we would tell you that we've hired somebody, and us giving you information can be done via email.

101
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:46,110
If there was a need for a discussion or a decision, that would have to come back to a public meeting to do it at that.

102
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,272
But we could keep you informed as to the process.

103
00:10:50,059 --> 00:11:00,647
Right, and once a consultant is selected and is doing this report, they would be coming back, they would be reporting back to us essentially, would we be the client, right?

104
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:00,947
Right.

105
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:02,188
Okay.

106
00:11:02,748 --> 00:11:03,068
Okay.

107
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:15,137
Great, so do we have a motion to request that the Department of Health and Human Services

108
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:24,211
planning, development and sustainability, prepare a scope of work for a consultant to evaluate our linkage schedule.

109
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:33,539
This is Deanna, I'll make that motion.

110
00:11:35,841 --> 00:11:36,321
Thank you, Deanna.

111
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:39,324
David, did you have a question or did you want to?

112
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,466
That's fine, I could second the motion.

113
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:42,627
All right, thank you.

114
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:45,309
Roll call vote.

115
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,490
Deanna Peabody.

116
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,651
Aye.

117
00:11:48,772 --> 00:11:49,553
Les Andresen.

118
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:50,494
Aye.

119
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:52,096
David Blumberg.

120
00:11:52,536 --> 00:11:52,676
Aye.

121
00:11:53,597 --> 00:11:54,218
Christy Dowd.

122
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:55,439
Aye.

123
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,543
And then an aye as well.

124
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:01,745
So 5-0, the motion passes.

125
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:02,506
Thank you, Director Hunt.

126
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:10,639
There was one other thing with linkage I just I wanted to keep them separate so that it was very clean that that that was one thing that actually I feel is something.

127
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:19,106
My personal recommendation is that we should be doing something like that every three years, so this should become routine that we.

128
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:27,334
get an update every three years and make an active decision whether or not to update them based on some sort of data.

129
00:12:28,655 --> 00:12:29,977
So that's one thing.

130
00:12:30,397 --> 00:12:37,404
The other thing that has come up is I've been working a lot, this is actually perhaps the right time to introduce that we

131
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:44,989
For those of you who haven't heard, our city engineer, Tim McGivern, was appointed direct commissioner of public works.

132
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:46,309
He's here with us this evening.

133
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:51,152
And Owen Wartella has been appointed as our new city engineer.

134
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:59,116
And I had been talking to Tim about stormwater, and this is actually one of Owen's strong areas of expertise.

135
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:06,560
And we had been discussing some ideas around stormwater, stormwater fees, stormwater assessments.

136
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,801
how that could work.

137
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:17,608
And one of the things that Owen and I have discussed very recently is the idea of having a stormwater fee assessment with new development.

138
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:22,912
And I said that sounds actually exactly like what we do with linkage.

139
00:13:23,873 --> 00:13:25,134
So we were reviewing the

140
00:13:25,854 --> 00:13:30,696
enabling language for linkage, which seems to allow an expansion of linkage.

141
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:34,697
And so that is something we wanted to consider and do a review of.

142
00:13:35,298 --> 00:13:45,962
And to both, we would need legal consulting on that, as well as an economic evaluation to determine whether or not a category for stormwater

143
00:13:46,822 --> 00:13:48,284
with climate change, as you know.

144
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:53,548
So it used to be that, you know, you had stormwater was in the ground, you replace pipes occasionally.

145
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:56,290
Now we need bigger and more because of climate change.

146
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,592
We're having more and more precipitation in this area.

147
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:06,297
And so this is something that we wanted to consider and look into was the idea right now, I'm gonna do this off.

148
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:08,499
I don't need to do this off the top of my head.

149
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,302
I was gonna name the stormwater categories.

150
00:14:12,622 --> 00:14:13,463
My book isn't here.

151
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:27,630
Um, the storm or sorry, the stormwater, the linkage categories are parks and open space, roads, water and sewer, police and fire, public safety.

152
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:36,932
And it is conceivable that when they passed this in 1989, when they said water and sewer, they meant

153
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:41,256
water, sanitary sewer, and storm sewer.

154
00:14:41,876 --> 00:14:43,497
We no longer refer to it that way.

155
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:45,959
Now we call it storm water, not storm sewer.

156
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,763
So we're not, there isn't a great way to tell.

157
00:14:51,163 --> 00:15:00,350
We may need to do some analysis of what they implied, but the way it was written was things such as the following categories could be assessed with linkage.

158
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,412
And there were other, many other things listed there.

159
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:07,175
And so our thought was to look into whether or not

160
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:14,319
it would make sense to add a category and a fee schedule for stormwater on new development.

161
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:25,787
And I sort of wanted to put that up to you that that's more of an area of discussion and not a we definitely should do this, but I think this this might be a smart way to look at it for the future.

162
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,650
But Director Hunt couldn't that be folded into the scope of work that we just recommended?

163
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:47,703
It could be it would definitely increase the scope of work, and we might want to do it as at the same time somehow sort of break them out that there were two scopes of work, maybe the second is the alternate that we definitely want to do one, what would be the price to do the other.

164
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:58,248
and I think that we may want to consult with some of our lawyers first to just get a second, get a legal set of eyes on the enabling legislation.

165
00:15:58,488 --> 00:16:11,514
I've read it, it looks to me like it says things such as, and stormwater really is such as those other things, but I think we should have a lawyer review it too.

166
00:16:11,534 --> 00:16:18,237
Thank you.

167
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:29,176
Moving on to the next agenda item, we have a couple of public way transfers potentially.

168
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,238
One moment.

169
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,283
So a request to accept Freedom Way as a public way.

170
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:48,272
This is the job of the Community Development Board to submit a recommendation to the city council on whether to accept Freedom Way as a public way.

171
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:57,030
and we have City Engineer Owen Wartella here to tee this up for us.

172
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,530
Engineer Wartella, welcome.

173
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:03,712
This is the first time I think I've met you for sure and probably the rest of the board.

174
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:08,053
So if you could take a moment just to introduce yourself to us, that would be terrific.

175
00:17:08,573 --> 00:17:10,034
Hi, how are you guys?

176
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:12,755
I'm Owen, I'm the new City Engineer and

177
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:19,724
I've been here for a few months and I come from many, many years in the private sector.

178
00:17:19,824 --> 00:17:23,444
So this is all kind of sort of new to me, but not really.

179
00:17:23,484 --> 00:17:28,826
I've been on the other side many times and I've volunteered with my local community as well.

180
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,586
So it is kind of familiar with me.

181
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:37,548
So, but I'm enjoying it here and I hope to get to meet every one of you.

182
00:17:39,798 --> 00:18:01,517
If you want to just dive right in here, I don't know how familiar you guys are with this public way, but what the intent is, is that these public ways are ownership by the school, and we are trying to acquire them into the city so that we could use the appropriate funds so that we can fix them.

183
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:08,975
So this whole process basically started when Tim was here, and now I'm taking it on.

184
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:21,905
So what we're looking for is a favorable report from city council for them to recommend and approve the public ways of Steve Miller Drive and Freedom Way.

185
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:31,472
And Engineer Wartella, could you explain to us what the benefit to the city is of accepting them?

186
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,961
I'm glad you mentioned that.

187
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:43,728
So there are, as part of this, since they are existing roadways or site drives, there are no improvements as part of this acceptance.

188
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:48,532
And so the estimate of betterments is zero for the city.

189
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:56,218
It's just basically the legal documentation of who owns it is going to be different.

190
00:18:57,218 --> 00:18:59,320
The entity, it's not going to be the school, it's going to be the city.

191
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:13,923
And does that, my understanding is that in terms of calculation, for example, for state aid for road repairs, the kind of the mileage of the roadways is affected by that.

192
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:18,944
So this would add to the city's mileage and maybe increase it.

193
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:21,664
Yes, it actually will.

194
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:24,825
We've just recently done that and we've increased

195
00:19:26,235 --> 00:19:34,322
I think this year maybe four miles to Bedford so we're trying to go back and get adjusted funds from the state to for those funds.

196
00:19:34,522 --> 00:19:38,785
Yes, but this will just be a more additional for the next round.

197
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:50,715
And Freedom Way is just to remind everybody is the roadway it's essentially, it acts as a roadway even though it's been a driveway which I just learned recently.

198
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:58,373
that goes from Riverside Ave over to the Wegmans Plaza area.

199
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:02,914
So people use it obviously as a road.

200
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:06,016
It's not in very good condition right now.

201
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:08,396
I can basically see it from my window.

202
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,358
Yeah, it's about 20 years old now.

203
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:16,720
So it needs some care.

204
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,021
So is it owned by the school?

205
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:20,461
Sorry.

206
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,424
Yeah, I believe the school board owns it.

207
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:29,421
I believe Tim can, if he wants to hop on here, he can probably talk to more about that, but I believe it's the school board owns it.

208
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:37,381
Yeah, the school it's owned by the city so it's a city parcel but there's a school on it, so it's a school building parcel building lot.

209
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:49,071
So, in the characterization of a site driveway is correct, and I think the only other benefit that wasn't mentioned was that we would be able to spend state aid money on the road to fix it up.

210
00:20:49,432 --> 00:20:50,573
So chapter 90 money.

211
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:52,875
So that's why we haven't been able to fix it up.

212
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,798
So, we're trying to resolve that and

213
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:01,883
We're basically transferring the property from ourselves from one type of parcel to a different type of parcel.

214
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:11,090
So it's laid out as a public way and can be accepted as such with as Owen mentioned betterments of zero because we're not planning on doing anything or taxing ourselves to do it.

215
00:21:12,211 --> 00:21:18,876
So all we need to do really is lay it out, get the recommendation from this board to city council to endorse it.

216
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:19,977
Thank you.

217
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:23,500
So the expectation is that it's going to be fixed once this happens?

218
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:31,153
Yes, then we would queue it up for repairs, preventative maintenance as well as curbing, and such, actually already.

219
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:36,555
We've already ordered curbing to see if we can do just some rebuilds box outs, and a million overlay.

220
00:21:39,735 --> 00:21:51,439
I guess the only thing I would suggest is that, you know, before the road gets fixed which I

221
00:21:51,964 --> 00:21:53,285
desperately needs to be fixed.

222
00:21:53,345 --> 00:22:04,870
I also think it needs to be looked at from a sort of traffic equity point of view.

223
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:13,574
I'm wondering if that's something that we could request.

224
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:17,676
Can you explain what you mean by that.

225
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:36,849
It's a two lane road with striping basically for, you know, cars and buses and there's no bike lanes and there's no, none of that has been considered obviously because it's 20 years old.

226
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:50,172
And I just think it should probably be looked at holistically before we start making just repairs to the system that's there today, which is again,

227
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:53,497
out of date and not up to current standards.

228
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:57,820
I can address that.

229
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,000
Yep.

230
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:09,709
Um, so the road as it is, is restricted, based upon the development that land when the schools were put there, so we have, we have what we have there.

231
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,492
We can't really expand it to get more with.

232
00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:17,795
unless we start doing things like reducing sidewalk width, which we may not want to do.

233
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:34,991
The school though, we would still own the city, the school would still own the sides of the road to be on the back of sidewalk so any sort of increases for pedestrian traffic in the future could be thought of in that zone, I believe, as long as it's not encouraging on the

234
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,724
conservation aspects of the development.

235
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:39,605
So that can be looked into.

236
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:52,130
And then as far as improvements we would be pretty restricted to material improvements like concrete curb to granite curb, which is an improvement but not necessarily for traffic equity.

237
00:23:52,850 --> 00:24:07,100
But we would look into putting bicycle accommodations and paint on the road, but I can't tell you just knowing the road that the it's pretty narrow for that so probably talking like share the road shadows reduce speed, maybe like a speed hump or something like that.

238
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,463
So those are the types of discussions that we've had on so.

239
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:12,644
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

240
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:13,084
That's great.

241
00:24:13,424 --> 00:24:13,584
Yep.

242
00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:14,845
So that's what we would be looking at.

243
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:25,712
So anytime we are doing any sort of maintenance work on a road, we try to work with what we have and improve it with creating some giant capital project or something like that.

244
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:37,003
Actually, my concern or inquiry was about the sidewalks alongside it because it does the very weird thing.

245
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:45,528
As you know, pedestrians end up walking over the curb and there's that dirt area where there's no sidewalk.

246
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:56,194
So I'm wondering if we could actually make a pedestrian kind of crossing that's much safer there next to the road so that people don't have to like go into the parking lot

247
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:59,515
Most likely something can.

248
00:24:59,535 --> 00:25:09,138
I could give a dissertation on this subject, because I walk my kids to that school, that's your house every day and it's, there's just so many things that are wrong that intersection.

249
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:16,399
First and foremost, where, you know, people come hauling down Riverside Avenue, you know you have kids.

250
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:21,660
Thank God we have a crossing guard but you know they're not there.

251
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,001
Let's say they're there for maybe an hour a day so.

252
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:29,930
there's a lot of things that I think that need to be fixed in that artery.

253
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:36,173
And that's sort of what I was getting at with my question to Tim.

254
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:37,054
Yeah.

255
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:44,698
When you guys take a look at it, that looking at that entrance that to Riverside Ave is kind of a pretty big apron.

256
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:49,962
And if that could be kind of narrowed a bit.

257
00:25:50,322 --> 00:25:55,665
We don't even have a push button

258
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,201
Same now there.

259
00:25:59,022 --> 00:26:14,537
So, we will be limited with the type of project that it's going to be so we will be doing things like extending our Milan overlay to encompass the intersection, as much as we can, you know, reasonable amount, we typically do handicap ramps and these type of projects and we typically do sidewalk repairs.

260
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,720
So that's kind of what you can expect, and then sign painted.

261
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:31,352
Like like I discussed and then potentially some speed humps and then when you start talking about changing signals and upgrading those it becomes a different level of project so to speak much larger amounts of money and.

262
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:33,720
Um, a different way to procure it.

263
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:48,007
So with all that said, um, you know, what we can do relatively quickly with the funding that we're using for these type of improvements, um, that's, you know, hopefully I've described what kind of project that we're looking at here.

264
00:26:48,027 --> 00:26:51,448
Um, you know, hopefully.

265
00:26:51,468 --> 00:26:52,009
Director Hunt.

266
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:58,272
Sorry, having trouble with my mute button.

267
00:26:58,512 --> 00:26:59,072
Um, thank you.

268
00:26:59,902 --> 00:27:11,445
Tim, could you share with the board how, if they wanted to get something, like, I feel what I'm hearing them say, but it's not the same language, is a complete streets project.

269
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:22,107
And how would one put in a request to the city for things like the intersection improvements or complete streets?

270
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:28,409
Because we do have a list that exists in the city, and how would one get these added to that list?

271
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:42,234
Sure, so there's a complete streets committee, and I believe what we're trying to do when I was on it before the whole transition to Commissioner thing, we always sort of left things was we created a process for just that thing.

272
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:46,916
So if basically all you need to do is talk to one of those committee members.

273
00:27:50,697 --> 00:27:51,237
of that committee.

274
00:27:51,257 --> 00:28:00,363
So you could tell Owen and then it gets on a list and then it's basically vetted out through that committee and it bubbles into a set of recommendations that then go to the mayor.

275
00:28:01,043 --> 00:28:01,944
So that's probably the best way.

276
00:28:02,904 --> 00:28:03,184
Sorry.

277
00:28:03,204 --> 00:28:05,726
It's okay.

278
00:28:05,846 --> 00:28:17,993
I said I don't know about my fellow board members here but I would love to have the Complete Streets Committee join us for a meeting so they can discuss their projects and their process.

279
00:28:18,273 --> 00:28:19,854
I think that would be enlightening.

280
00:28:20,303 --> 00:28:29,610
given the fact that that's basically our charge here is to understand how, you know, private projects interact with the public way.

281
00:28:30,651 --> 00:28:33,093
So I can probably set that up with you.

282
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:34,414
No problem.

283
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:35,354
That would be great.

284
00:28:36,475 --> 00:28:37,336
That's a great idea.

285
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:39,437
Oh, synergies.

286
00:28:39,497 --> 00:28:39,838
I love it.

287
00:28:40,078 --> 00:28:40,958
Fantastic.

288
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,863
Other board members have any questions or comments about this project?

289
00:28:53,626 --> 00:29:05,993
Okay, so I think we are able to entertain a motion to recommend to the city council to accept Freedom Way as a public way.

290
00:29:07,794 --> 00:29:08,634
I will make that motion.

291
00:29:09,795 --> 00:29:10,135
Happily.

292
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:11,836
Plus, is there a second?

293
00:29:14,137 --> 00:29:15,578
Under its David I'll second the motion.

294
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:19,780
A roll call vote, plus Andreessen.

295
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,521
Hi, David Blumberg.

296
00:29:24,194 --> 00:29:24,814
Deanna Peabody.

297
00:29:25,815 --> 00:29:25,955
Aye.

298
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:27,395
Christy Dowd.

299
00:29:27,415 --> 00:29:28,396
Aye.

300
00:29:29,116 --> 00:29:30,277
And I'm in aye as well.

301
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:31,477
So five, zero.

302
00:29:32,518 --> 00:29:33,218
Motion passes.

303
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:34,378
Great, thank you.

304
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,000
Next item on the agenda is a similar one.

305
00:29:39,061 --> 00:29:45,803
This is the Steve Miller Way, which is the roadway going up to the high school.

306
00:29:46,804 --> 00:29:50,946
So Engineer Wartella, anything different about this project?

307
00:29:50,966 --> 00:29:53,547
The only thing different about this one is the length.

308
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:59,330
is the same, there's still the betterments is zero.

309
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,652
And we're just asking for it same kind of process.

310
00:30:04,712 --> 00:30:05,632
It's owned by the school.

311
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:12,594
We're trying to move it to owned by the city so we can use state and federal funds to prepare.

312
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:14,655
Thank you.

313
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:17,596
Any questions or comments about this one?

314
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:19,516
I agree, David.

315
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,701
I just thought the discussion of the city's plans on Freedom Way was very enlightening.

316
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:33,603
And so if there's some background that the city could offer us on what the plans might be for Steve Miller as well, that would be great.

317
00:30:37,784 --> 00:30:45,286
Tim or Owen, would you be able to talk about any improvements that might be in the works?

318
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,728
I'm not aware of any improvements at that.

319
00:30:51,672 --> 00:30:56,235
on this road on Winthrop Street, that's a whole different scenario that's coming.

320
00:30:57,156 --> 00:31:04,620
But for the most part, you know, again, first process is to, you know, switch it over to ownership.

321
00:31:05,061 --> 00:31:16,268
And then from there, we can, you know, put it on the list of, you know, future roads to, you know, look at complete streets with maybe traffic calming measures, and all the aspects that you want.

322
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:17,489
Yeah.

323
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,130
I think

324
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:22,908
For me, a bike lane on that one would be huge.

325
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:30,514
Where does, obviously it starts at Winthrop, where does it end?

326
00:31:34,778 --> 00:31:35,559
It ends at the school.

327
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,001
Like at that first intersection?

328
00:31:39,302 --> 00:31:44,966
At the first intersection, right where the parking lot is.

329
00:31:47,008 --> 00:31:49,110
Okay, so just that first little spur.

330
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,190
Yes, that's exactly right.

331
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:54,151
Thank you.

332
00:31:57,171 --> 00:31:58,411
Other questions, comments?

333
00:31:59,372 --> 00:32:00,412
If not, a motion?

334
00:32:08,653 --> 00:32:09,634
I'll make that motion again.

335
00:32:11,294 --> 00:32:13,194
Is there a second?

336
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:15,575
Andre, it's David, I'll second.

337
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:17,015
Thank you, David.

338
00:32:18,884 --> 00:32:19,624
roll call vote.

339
00:32:19,845 --> 00:32:20,545
Class Andreessen.

340
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:21,346
Hi.

341
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:23,108
David Bloomberg.

342
00:32:23,688 --> 00:32:23,869
Hi.

343
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,371
Christie Dowd.

344
00:32:27,332 --> 00:32:27,532
Hi.

345
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:28,934
Anna Peabody.

346
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:30,055
Hi.

347
00:32:30,635 --> 00:32:31,896
And I'm an eye as well.

348
00:32:32,377 --> 00:32:40,285
So the motion to recommend the city council adopt a Steve Miller way as a public way is passed.

349
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:45,681
There's one more thing that I just kind of want to put on your guys radar.

350
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:56,225
These my lars need to be endorsed by the element board members, so you'll need to come in and sign.

351
00:32:57,305 --> 00:32:57,565
Okay.

352
00:32:58,286 --> 00:33:06,208
And generally, our, our planner Amanda Cinchella handles that corralling us and telling us where to go.

353
00:33:06,288 --> 00:33:08,649
And so, I think we'll.

354
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:09,149
Thank you.

355
00:33:12,964 --> 00:33:22,807
I will shepherd you all.

356
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:28,129
Next item on the agenda is 23 Sycamore Ave linkage credit application.

357
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:36,811
Here, I'm going to pass this to Planner Santrella to kind of tee this up and explain what is happening.

358
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:40,672
And then we have some proponents to talk about their request.

359
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:42,293
Andre.

360
00:33:43,248 --> 00:33:44,450
Yes, this is the one.

361
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:45,411
Right.

362
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:46,332
Yes.

363
00:33:47,033 --> 00:33:53,582
Okay, yeah, I'm going to recuse myself from this because I have an affiliation with a firm working on this project.

364
00:33:54,203 --> 00:33:54,424
Thanks.

365
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,833
All right, thanks for the intro, Andre.

366
00:34:01,714 --> 00:34:12,705
So I thought maybe I would just briefly describe kind of the nature of this request, and then I would hand the baton to the Oxford Properties from 23 Sycamore.

367
00:34:13,646 --> 00:34:18,991
So the idea behind this is that, as you all know or are aware of,

368
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:28,464
that for every, you know, larger development property or project that comes through the city, there's an associated development impact fee kind of system that we call linkage.

369
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:36,287
In this case, 23 Sycamore, that project was approved by the board and

370
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:54,648
the engineering, I think, division, and or DPW more generally, had asked that the proponent kind of look into some of the water and sewer work, like network that exists and infrastructure that exists for that area.

371
00:34:56,029 --> 00:35:06,592
The proponent went ahead and did that, and my understanding is that, you know, was able to come to the conclusion that actually a lot of work did need to happen there in order to support the project.

372
00:35:07,558 --> 00:35:12,880
Um, so what I believe will be proposed tonight is that, um.

373
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:19,983
The proponent has since worked with engineering DPW, um and is.

374
00:35:20,924 --> 00:35:29,107
Proposing to do this work, which they have detailed how much that work is valued at, um and that that work will be

375
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:51,241
Um, and I believe we have, uh, values that, um, Valerie will share with us, but I want to say that actually the, um, proposed amount of work exceeds the, what would have been the linkage costs.

376
00:35:52,581 --> 00:35:57,264
Um, so with that, I think I will hand it off to Valerie and her team.

377
00:35:58,264 --> 00:35:59,745
Um, and we can go from there.

378
00:36:01,398 --> 00:36:02,799
Thank you very much, Amanda.

379
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:10,743
Valerie Moore from Nutter, McLennan & Fish here on behalf of the applicant Oxford Properties together with Ken Stapier from BHB.

380
00:36:10,763 --> 00:36:17,726
I think Amanda did a great job actually summarizing everything so I won't add too terribly much more to it.

381
00:36:17,746 --> 00:36:24,170
As Amanda noted, this came about as part of the

382
00:36:26,336 --> 00:36:37,485
of the sewer line in Sycamore Avenue that was requested as part of the site plan approval that this board issued and the estimate that the applicant received for the work was $134,000.

383
00:36:38,145 --> 00:36:44,650
The linkage fees that would otherwise be due are approximately $68,000.

384
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:53,657
So as you can see, the value of the work far exceeds the linkage fees that would otherwise be paid to this city.

385
00:36:54,822 --> 00:37:08,106
Um, Oxford is willing to absorb the entire cost of the repair rather than entering into some kind of cost sharing arrangement with the city and would be undertaking the work in its entirety.

386
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:17,749
Um, and is asking that that be credited against the linkage fees that would otherwise be due, um, set forth in the zoning ordinance.

387
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,631
And this board has the ability to approve, um,

388
00:37:23,346 --> 00:37:29,348
credit against linkage for voluntary site-related improvements that are undertaken by a project applicant.

389
00:37:29,408 --> 00:37:31,689
So that's the basis for it.

390
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:37,372
With that, I'm happy to answer any questions that the board may have about it.

391
00:37:41,033 --> 00:37:41,453
Thank you, Ms.

392
00:37:41,473 --> 00:37:43,634
Moore.

393
00:37:43,654 --> 00:37:50,957
I guess, let me go to Commissioner McGivern to see if he has any comments on this before we open it up to questions.

394
00:37:53,306 --> 00:37:54,703
I'll say it all rings true.

395
00:37:55,812 --> 00:38:03,476
and I did work with the proponents and their team to look at the sewer and kind of see what was wrong with it.

396
00:38:03,576 --> 00:38:15,841
We had talked about some spot repairs, but it made sense to, I believe, if I understand what they're proposing, is what we discussed is replacement of some of the line there in Sycamore Ave where it connects to Riverside.

397
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:22,965
So I think it makes total sense, and I would be in favor of doing an arrangement like this.

398
00:38:23,345 --> 00:38:23,565
Thank you.

399
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:29,972
Any members have questions for attorney more or her team.

400
00:38:32,473 --> 00:38:46,679
And just to note that we, this board did take a similar action for the housing development on locust have across from the Wegman's Andre David.

401
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:47,779
Yes, David.

402
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:51,961
I have a question it's not for attorney more I don't think, but more for the city.

403
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:59,706
Are we feeling comfortable that the vendor is pricing this reasonably.

404
00:39:00,786 --> 00:39:04,188
I only saw in the materials that there was one proposal.

405
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:14,453
Obviously, the money is ultimately at some level the cities to do this or do something else we want to make sure that we have good, good pricing on the project.

406
00:39:15,234 --> 00:39:20,737
And we're working for the Oxford is working with a good vendor who will leave this.

407
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:24,772
project in good condition and do a good job.

408
00:39:25,172 --> 00:39:28,174
So, if the city could comment on that, that'd be helpful.

409
00:39:29,475 --> 00:39:29,635
Sure.

410
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:40,180
So, this, the board can certainly just request that the engineering division review to whatever level of standard you'd like.

411
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:48,444
So, I think we would tip and I think I'll install the call, but we would typically review it on behalf of the board.

412
00:39:50,313 --> 00:39:52,734
And I'm not exactly sure where this is in that process.

413
00:39:53,654 --> 00:40:01,056
And I think when it comes to doing the work, there will be requirements for them to meet our typical standards.

414
00:40:01,196 --> 00:40:03,117
There'll be inspections with the water and sewer division.

415
00:40:04,097 --> 00:40:07,338
There will be a street opening permit for connections.

416
00:40:08,438 --> 00:40:09,659
So all that will be taking place.

417
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:14,700
So the typical quality control that we perform on ourselves and other contractors would be taking place.

418
00:40:15,721 --> 00:40:19,522
So hopefully that, and usually there's a quality

419
00:40:20,565 --> 00:40:26,849
control video at the end of something like this to just to say, yep, it's all there documented and then some sort of as built condition.

420
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:30,672
So we would anticipate all of that would take place as part of this.

421
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:39,780
Thanks, Tim for answering that knowing the cities involved in checking the pricing and the quality is is good.

422
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,521
That's very helpful.

423
00:40:40,581 --> 00:40:40,821
Thanks.

424
00:40:41,261 --> 00:40:49,749
And like I said, it's up to you if you did, you will go as deep into it as you'd like linkage was 60 something thousand and the proposals

425
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,111
$20,000 worth of work.

426
00:40:52,451 --> 00:41:10,003
So I think probably the recommended level is making sure that it passes the sniff test and that the scope of work matches what was discussed with the city and that the plan would be to use current standard materials and methods for the execution, which I have no doubt that they're planning on doing.

427
00:41:12,945 --> 00:41:19,630
If I may add on to that, I believe as part of the permitting for the work, we would also be posting a

428
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:26,116
contractor will be posting a performance bond to ensure that the work is completed to the city standards.

429
00:41:27,697 --> 00:41:32,658
Thank you.

430
00:41:34,999 --> 00:41:38,219
Any other questions or comments from members of the board?

431
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:47,982
Okay, hearing none, do we have a motion on the floor to

432
00:41:50,649 --> 00:42:00,795
just get this right, to accept the application for a linkage credit for the work done by the proponent.

433
00:42:04,937 --> 00:42:05,637
This is David.

434
00:42:05,677 --> 00:42:07,118
I would like to make that motion.

435
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:08,779
Thank you, David.

436
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:09,399
Is there a second?

437
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,080
This is Christy.

438
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,580
I second.

439
00:42:12,481 --> 00:42:13,181
Thank you, Christy.

440
00:42:13,982 --> 00:42:14,682
Roll call vote.

441
00:42:15,302 --> 00:42:15,963
David Blumberg.

442
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:17,344
Aye.

443
00:42:18,304 --> 00:42:18,924
Christy Dowd.

444
00:42:19,825 --> 00:42:19,905
Aye.

445
00:42:20,613 --> 00:42:21,293
Tiana Peabody.

446
00:42:21,313 --> 00:42:22,434
Aye.

447
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:24,594
And I'm an aye as well.

448
00:42:24,874 --> 00:42:26,335
So 4-0 motion passes.

449
00:42:28,035 --> 00:42:29,576
Thank you, Attorney Moore and your team.

450
00:42:30,596 --> 00:42:31,236
Thank you all.

451
00:42:31,296 --> 00:42:34,817
I really appreciate it.

452
00:42:34,877 --> 00:42:35,297
Have a good night.

453
00:42:35,317 --> 00:42:35,677
Thank you.

454
00:42:36,378 --> 00:42:36,738
Thank you.

455
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:37,198
You too.

456
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:43,900
That brings us to our last

457
00:42:45,398 --> 00:42:54,024
item on the agenda, which is just miscellaneous and other updates, and I will turn this over to Linus and Trella.

458
00:42:55,665 --> 00:42:56,305
Thanks, Andre.

459
00:42:57,166 --> 00:43:01,129
So just two things that I kind of wanted to put on the board's radar.

460
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:13,937
As you all are already aware, probably we've got a site plan review process coming up for 4060 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is the rise development.

461
00:43:13,957 --> 00:43:14,258
It's a

462
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:18,240
biolife sciences lab space there.

463
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:25,644
So you all can expect materials and comments coming in from me over the next week or so.

464
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:32,811
And just a reminder that our next meeting date is May 16th, Monday.

465
00:43:32,831 --> 00:43:48,123
And then in addition to that, folks might know that there is going to be a community meeting over Zoom tomorrow evening for a proposed project, Great American Beer Hall.

466
00:43:48,783 --> 00:43:51,184
which I should get the address for.

467
00:43:51,204 --> 00:43:56,507
I just know it because it's very close to where I live and it's on Mystic Ave.

468
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:07,713
You know, board members are not obligated to be there, but I just wanted to put it on your radar as something that is happening and will likely come before us in the near-ish term.

469
00:44:09,474 --> 00:44:15,918
And I welcome Alicia or Vic, if you're on the line still, if you have anything else you want to add, feel free.

470
00:44:19,405 --> 00:44:24,689
Amanda, just that the Green American Beer Hall location is 142 Mystic Ave.

471
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:29,432
It's the site of a bus parking lot currently.

472
00:44:30,532 --> 00:44:30,993
Thanks, Greg.

473
00:44:33,494 --> 00:44:44,082
My understanding is the concept there is that it is not like a brewery, but it's kind of like a place where other craft brewers

474
00:44:45,484 --> 00:44:48,405
bring, sort of have stalls or something like that?

475
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,365
Is that what that is?

476
00:44:51,985 --> 00:45:01,768
Yeah, they'll be working with a distributor for the beer, but targeting regional craft beers for the taps.

477
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:12,190
And it'll have a beer hall, food hall, type five, common seating in the middle, some game rooms, outdoor patio space.

478
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:19,113
If folks have been to any of Trillium's setups, it's the same architect.

479
00:45:19,873 --> 00:45:25,195
So modern, fun, beer hall vibe is what they're going for.

480
00:45:25,235 --> 00:45:28,157
Are we allowed to do fun in Medford?

481
00:45:29,557 --> 00:45:31,698
We're really pushing the limits here, Andre.

482
00:45:31,718 --> 00:45:32,419
We'll see.

483
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,240
Great, thank you.

484
00:45:40,162 --> 00:45:41,743
Director Hunt, any updates from you?

485
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,984
Right, I think we're- I will just remind everybody comprehensive plan.

486
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:55,430
So Circle the Square is, we'll get that to you.

487
00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:01,236
The comprehensive plan is not doing a public meeting to present sort of the final stuff, draft things.

488
00:46:01,616 --> 00:46:08,883
They're gonna have tables at the Circle the Square with the hopes of engaging with more people who would be there at that event.

489
00:46:09,723 --> 00:46:18,547
And that is Saturday, June 18th from three to seven in the afternoon in Medford Square.

490
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:26,630
And all over Medford Square, we don't know where their tables will be, but the consultants will be there with a lot of draft comprehensive plan materials.

491
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,351
You're welcome to talk to them.

492
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:29,891
Other people are talking to them.

493
00:46:31,012 --> 00:46:36,334
That's when they're gonna be releasing the draft comprehensive plan for comment for the next several months.

494
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:44,249
Director Hunt, just on that topic, does the comprehensive plan draft come to us at all?

495
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:53,196
Or I know that our vice chair, Jackie Furtado, has been participating in that committee, but we've never really had kind of a briefing about it.

496
00:46:53,216 --> 00:46:55,378
And I'm wondering whether members are interested in that.

497
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:57,760
So that's actually a good point.

498
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:07,088
In the end, the Community Development Board is asked to accept it, I believe, in theory, because it is part of

499
00:47:07,885 --> 00:47:13,087
I had that in front of me, chapter 41, section 81.

500
00:47:13,127 --> 00:47:17,509
I wrote it down on something earlier today.

501
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:24,372
And that it's the Community Development Board has a comprehensive plan.

502
00:47:25,453 --> 00:47:36,778
So we can ask them to come present to the board if you guys would prefer that format, or for you guys to review it, whether you wanna have them come in during draft period,

503
00:47:37,642 --> 00:47:39,864
happy to arrange for them to come meet with you all.

504
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:43,307
Any thoughts from board members?

505
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:49,673
I see you nodding, Christy.

506
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:50,975
Yes.

507
00:47:51,495 --> 00:47:51,795
Yes.

508
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:54,458
Yes, please.

509
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:56,120
Provide a briefing.

510
00:47:58,243 --> 00:48:09,006
I guess I'd love you all feeling, is this like they present for 20 minutes, you ask 10 minutes of questions and we're done, and that's part of another meeting?

511
00:48:09,626 --> 00:48:17,609
Or should we actually plan a separate meeting for you all so that you feel like you can take as much time with it as you want?

512
00:48:17,929 --> 00:48:27,492
Because I don't wanna ask you all to add unnecessary meetings, but if it's preferable for you to have it as a separate meeting, we can arrange that.

513
00:48:30,578 --> 00:48:43,687
I prefer the separate meeting, even though I hate to impact on meetings, but I think it's pretty important and of significant interest that I think we could benefit from a separate meeting.

514
00:48:45,128 --> 00:48:46,810
That's just my vote.

515
00:48:49,111 --> 00:48:49,972
I'd second that motion.

516
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:54,380
It's the community development board.

517
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,624
Not everybody might in the public may know that we are also considered the planning board for the city.

518
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:04,006
So it seems like this may be an important thing for us to review.

519
00:49:06,688 --> 00:49:16,255
And I would prefer to do it in the drafts, either right before it's released as draft or in the draft window, just

520
00:49:17,525 --> 00:49:33,330
Obviously it would be presented to this board as a final document, but I would prefer, as you're saying that, for you all to see it and be able to say like, let's change this piece or that word or this section, whatever, and that still be a really doable thing.

521
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:38,272
Right, and would we have to host a public hearing or would it just be for the benefit of the board?

522
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:41,273
Because I know that there's been lots of public meetings around it.

523
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:55,829
The meeting we're discussing right now would be the difference, not a public hearing, no legal ad in the newspaper, but it would be a public meeting because if this board meets, it's a public meeting.

524
00:49:56,449 --> 00:50:07,395
Right, I was thinking more about the participation piece of it, whether it would be another forum for public participation on it or just an opportunity for us to engage with the document.

525
00:50:08,436 --> 00:50:10,537
I think that's up to the board how you'd like to do it.

526
00:50:12,326 --> 00:50:14,122
And right, I think that.

527
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:22,075
It feels like we've had a lot of public meetings where we've pushed out, get the public here, try to get the public here.

528
00:50:22,515 --> 00:50:24,717
And part of it is we've done them a lot of them online.

529
00:50:25,057 --> 00:50:30,400
And that's why we're going to circle the square to sort of be where the people are more rather than a meeting.

530
00:50:31,841 --> 00:50:41,808
So it seems to me that it would benefit this board if we posted a public meeting that the comprehensive plan was gonna be presented to this board.

531
00:50:41,848 --> 00:50:43,950
That was the topic of agenda for the evening.

532
00:50:44,835 --> 00:50:47,236
Um, and that's it.

533
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:51,098
We don't push to get the members of the public here, right?

534
00:50:51,138 --> 00:50:57,220
This is, you know, I will say that we have a number of planners that live in Medford.

535
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:05,543
They may be interested to see the questions that this board asks of the comprehensive plan, but we wouldn't build it as a forum for the public.

536
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,504
This would be a meeting for the board.

537
00:51:07,524 --> 00:51:08,325
Okay.

538
00:51:09,285 --> 00:51:14,207
Um, Jackie, I saw you just went offline, but I'm wondering whether you have any thoughts about this issue.

539
00:51:15,397 --> 00:51:39,872
One of the questions that I had for Alicia and this is I'm not sure if this is the proper forum but I know there was some back and forth with the actual comprehensive plan itself in the public and some of the steering committee members were just trying to figure out implementation actually and you graciously explained to them all the work that Community Development Office was doing to prepare that and I just

540
00:51:40,372 --> 00:51:42,013
was trying to figure out the steps myself.

541
00:51:42,053 --> 00:51:48,515
And I know that there's a lot of work behind the scenes that's being done, but even before we get to implementation, obviously, as you say, we have to get to a draft.

542
00:51:48,955 --> 00:51:54,657
And I'm just wondering what more work will even the steering committee get to do before it even gets to the community development board?

543
00:51:54,677 --> 00:51:58,378
So there is one more steering committee meeting.

544
00:51:58,658 --> 00:52:00,299
Amanda could tell us when that is.

545
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:08,442
And it is my expectation that there would actually be an implementation plan

546
00:52:09,396 --> 00:52:11,038
in the draft plan.

547
00:52:11,739 --> 00:52:16,383
And that is one of the things that is being worked on at this time.

548
00:52:17,805 --> 00:52:25,212
I am anticipating that one of the recommendations would be to form an implementation committee.

549
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:35,064
and that there might, and that would be like an oversight committee that might meet once or twice a year to check in and see where things are and how things are moving along.

550
00:52:36,864 --> 00:52:47,549
So I would anticipate that some members of the steering committee might want to be on the implementation committee, but others may feel that their service is done.

551
00:52:48,009 --> 00:52:54,912
So it would be set up as a new group, but there would likely, I would expect there to be some carryover from that.

552
00:52:56,212 --> 00:53:00,255
But that would be having an implementation committee would be like an oversight committee.

553
00:53:01,135 --> 00:53:09,379
And for those of you who aren't aware, so our should have said this, our Climate Action Plan, the final was released last week as part of Earth Month.

554
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:11,881
I invite you all to check it out.

555
00:53:12,001 --> 00:53:19,245
And I particularly say that because there is heavy influence from the

556
00:53:21,211 --> 00:53:25,494
The form of that has been feeling on the comprehensive plan.

557
00:53:25,594 --> 00:53:35,582
There's been discussion that we like how it's laid out with strategy, with goals and strategies and actions, and then like paragraph about each action.

558
00:53:36,282 --> 00:53:45,289
And we really like how there's a chart at the end that lists all the actions and it lists, it gives it, there's a timeline for each one.

559
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:46,810
And then there's a first,

560
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:51,092
milestone, and then there's a steward.

561
00:53:51,272 --> 00:53:55,336
So somebody in the city who is responsible for that action.

562
00:53:55,876 --> 00:54:01,521
And that is a table, it's a four or five page table at the end of the climate plan.

563
00:54:01,941 --> 00:54:05,384
And I've talked to the consultants that it feels right.

564
00:54:06,265 --> 00:54:12,270
And as long as people don't say, oh my God, that's a horrible idea, use this format instead.

565
00:54:13,711 --> 00:54:15,793
I'm expecting that we would end up with

566
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:19,515
a table, an implementation table like that as well.

567
00:54:19,975 --> 00:54:21,576
So I invite you to look at the climate plan.

568
00:54:22,397 --> 00:54:30,621
And if you have something else in mind that you think would be better, please show us that example because this is the best idea we have so far.

569
00:54:32,222 --> 00:54:37,265
And Amanda just dropped the link for you all of the climate plan in the chat.

570
00:54:38,732 --> 00:54:46,258
Right, and for anybody watching, there's also the next steering committee meeting for the comprehensive plans, May 18th from six to 8 p.m.

571
00:54:46,278 --> 00:54:59,568
So great, so I don't think we need to have a motion or anything, but maybe after that last steering committee meeting, we can schedule a meeting of the community development board to talk about the comprehensive plan.

572
00:55:00,729 --> 00:55:01,269
That'd be great.

573
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:06,013
Amanda will reach out to you all about scheduling and she'll reach out to the consultants about scheduling.

574
00:55:07,454 --> 00:55:12,117
And Jackie, just want to say thank you for all the time you've been putting into this on behalf of us.

575
00:55:13,558 --> 00:55:14,779
Thanks.

576
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:21,202
And if I can just congratulate the city, especially Alicia, on releasing your Climate Action Plan.

577
00:55:21,463 --> 00:55:26,025
The Medford patch actually made a notification, so I've been trying to get to it.

578
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:27,726
So I did know that it was out there.

579
00:55:27,766 --> 00:55:28,927
So congratulations on that.

580
00:55:29,807 --> 00:55:30,788
Thanks.

581
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:33,970
We're very excited that it's final and it's out there.

582
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:42,200
Thank you everybody, let's see we got two minutes before we go here we hit the hour mark so let's try to beat our record.

583
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,761
Oh, David.

584
00:55:45,481 --> 00:55:47,142
Oh we're offering congratulations.

585
00:55:47,422 --> 00:55:51,204
I want to offer a standing round of applause to you.

586
00:55:51,964 --> 00:55:58,628
I watched all of the city council proceedings on zoning, and thank you for representing the board and you did a great job.

587
00:56:00,218 --> 00:56:02,299
Thank you, well, that was a big win for all of us.

588
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:09,281
We put a lot of time into that and I think it paid off because they ended up really accepting almost just about everything.

589
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:10,081
Yeah.

590
00:56:12,282 --> 00:56:13,983
That was awesome work, yes.

591
00:56:14,323 --> 00:56:17,244
I echo David, that was awesome work, Andre.

592
00:56:17,284 --> 00:56:18,104
Thank you.

593
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:24,026
All right, now I'm gonna accept a motion.

594
00:56:28,155 --> 00:56:30,997
Andres, David, motion to adjourn for this evening.

595
00:56:31,857 --> 00:56:32,458
Thank you, David.

596
00:56:32,478 --> 00:56:33,838
I will second.

597
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:35,199
Thanks, class.

598
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:36,400
Roll call vote.

599
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,220
David Blumberg.

600
00:56:37,981 --> 00:56:38,101
Aye.

601
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:39,802
Class Andreessen.

602
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:40,642
Aye.

603
00:56:41,443 --> 00:56:42,083
Christy Dowd.

604
00:56:43,144 --> 00:56:43,244
Aye.

605
00:56:44,304 --> 00:56:45,105
Jackie Furtado.

606
00:56:45,785 --> 00:56:45,925
Aye.

607
00:56:46,586 --> 00:56:47,266
Deanna Peabody.

608
00:56:48,247 --> 00:56:48,347
Aye.

609
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:50,128
And I'm an aye as well.

610
00:56:50,208 --> 00:56:51,709
So thank you, everybody.

611
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:53,410
