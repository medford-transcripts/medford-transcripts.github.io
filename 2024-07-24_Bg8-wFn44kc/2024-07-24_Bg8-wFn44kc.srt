25
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

26
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:51,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

27
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,363
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a sad day.

28
00:01:55,626 --> 00:02:03,508
[SPEAKER_06]: when we heard the passing of probably one of the finest teachers to ever grace the hallways in the Medford Public Schools.

29
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:07,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Robin Irving was a very special person.

30
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:12,390
[SPEAKER_06]: She made it her life's mission to take care of our children.

31
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:21,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's over 40 years of service, and Robin fought the fight against cancer and lost her battle.

32
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:34,115
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ironic that today's her 70th birthday, and I know that the family has put together a GoFundMe page to make sure her name carries on.

33
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:37,571
[SPEAKER_06]: in her name to scholarships for deserving children.

34
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:39,872
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to mention that.

35
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:42,214
[SPEAKER_06]: She was an amazing person.

36
00:02:42,254 --> 00:02:45,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I had many friends that had Ms.

37
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Irving, and when they talked about Ms.

38
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:52,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Irving, as if they had a mother out of their home, someone that took care of them.

39
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:55,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when I was,

40
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:05,429
[SPEAKER_05]: awarded the position to be a McGlynn Elementary Phys Ed teacher, I was honored to work on the other side of the door of Ms.

41
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:05,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Irving's.

42
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you ever went by Ms.

43
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:12,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Irving's room, you know that she was a teacher.

44
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:18,557
[SPEAKER_05]: She had everything she needed for every kid with every single lesson.

45
00:03:20,057 --> 00:03:24,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And she was tough, there was times she was tough, but everybody respected her.

46
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:34,458
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we heard the sad news, I'm not less of a man to say, but I cried in my truck because she was one of the good ones.

47
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:42,819
[SPEAKER_05]: And just wanted to reach out to her family, especially her nieces and nephews.

48
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how much she loved them.

49
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,061
[SPEAKER_05]: And send our deepest condolences.

50
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,261
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a person that,

51
00:03:51,408 --> 00:04:03,150
[SPEAKER_05]: you wanna name a library after, or you wanna name, leave someone's name to show their legacy, Robin Irving's the teacher that deserves that.

52
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:10,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So goodbye, my friend, happy birthday, my friend, and thank you, Mr. President.

53
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:13,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

54
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:13,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Saint.

55
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:18,653
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

56
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:20,434
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, let me get the,

57
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:22,647
[SPEAKER_18]: get the audio working.

58
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:27,233
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to thank Councilor Scarpelli for introducing this resolution.

59
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:29,155
[SPEAKER_18]: I knew Ms.

60
00:04:29,175 --> 00:04:34,102
[SPEAKER_18]: Servini very, very well in my time at the McGlynn Middle School.

61
00:04:34,843 --> 00:04:38,327
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, Councilor Scarpelli spoke a little bit to

62
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,110
[SPEAKER_18]: how tough she was as a teacher.

63
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:48,076
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think, you know, if you just walk past the classroom, you would think that you would see the tough teacher that she was.

64
00:04:48,176 --> 00:04:52,679
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think Councilor Scarpelli also alluded to the fact that she really was there for every student.

65
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,821
[SPEAKER_18]: She knew what every student needed.

66
00:04:55,362 --> 00:05:04,910
[SPEAKER_18]: You could ask her about any student and she could tell you individualized, you know, what her plan was with that student and how to get them to where they needed to be.

67
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,292
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm not talking about math only.

68
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:18,451
[SPEAKER_18]: even though math was the subject that she taught, but I'm talking about learning how to grow up, how to mature, how to handle responsibilities.

69
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:21,615
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's something that really stands out in any of our

70
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:24,158
[SPEAKER_18]: memories of Ms.

71
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:30,703
[SPEAKER_18]: Irving as a teacher is how much she trusted her students to handle responsibility and to do adult tasks.

72
00:05:30,783 --> 00:05:39,150
[SPEAKER_18]: How, you know, she would ask students to run errands for her in the building, to talk to administrators, to practice

73
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:44,530
[SPEAKER_18]: doing those tasks that seemed really difficult to a seventh grader.

74
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:45,851
[SPEAKER_18]: Ms.

75
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:49,434
[SPEAKER_18]: Irving will be someone I think Medford will miss a lot.

76
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:55,919
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just have this deep, deep, deep love for her and I send my condolences to her family.

77
00:05:55,939 --> 00:06:01,844
[SPEAKER_18]: I wish her, you know, a happy birthday as Councilor Scarpelli did.

78
00:06:02,164 --> 00:06:05,787
[SPEAKER_18]: And again, I thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda.

79
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:09,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

80
00:06:11,618 --> 00:06:13,980
[SPEAKER_14]: On emotional Councilors are probably seconded by Councilors.

81
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,341

[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, 16 affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

156
00:09:53,867 --> 00:10:02,509
[SPEAKER_14]: 24354 and 24370 offered by Councilor Leming, Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, June 26, 2024, report to follow.

157
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,131
[SPEAKER_14]: By email, Councilor Leming sent me a report to read.

158
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:17,314
[SPEAKER_14]: The Council Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee edited and approved the June Council Newsletter, then discussed a guide to the practices and procedures of the City Council,

159
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:25,400
[SPEAKER_14]: and Councilor Tseng we'll be drafting a guide for residents to council practices and procedures to be discussed at a future committee meeting.

160
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,162
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion to approve?

161
00:10:28,782 --> 00:10:35,747
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion to approve the resident service and public engagement committee report by councilor, vice-president Collins, seconded by councilor Lazzaro.

162
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

163
00:10:37,088 --> 00:10:39,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Calderon?

164
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:39,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

165
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:40,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice-president Collins?

166
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:41,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

167
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:42,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazzaro?

168
00:10:42,672 --> 00:10:42,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

169
00:10:53,609 --> 00:10:54,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Sagan?

170
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:54,129
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

171
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

172
00:10:58,691 --> 00:10:59,232
[SPEAKER_09]: President Bears?

173
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:01,973
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, 60 affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

174
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:17,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Motions, orders, and resolutions 24441 offered by Councilor Scarpelli, whereas the Mayor and Medford City Council have repeatedly stated their goal to ensure the highest degree of transparency and accountability in all governmental matters, and whereas on June 28, 2024, Medford City Councilor George Scarpelli sent a letter

175
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,085
[SPEAKER_14]: to the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the State Auditor.

176
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:28,636
[SPEAKER_14]: And whereas the letter of Councilor Scott Polley raised various issues relating to the vote taken on significant municipal financial matters and the actions of the Medford City Council.

177
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:59,078
[SPEAKER_14]: And whereas, in light of the long-term absence of an appointed city solicitor in the city of Medford and the fact that the city's private legal counsel is a law firm hired by the mayor, and whereas the director of operations of the office of the state auditor responded to Councilor Scarpelli's letter, that the state auditor would, quote, examine the issues raised in the letter if the examination of these issues had the approval of a majority vote of the city council and the mayor, as required by state statute, and whereas the fairest and most objective fashion to resolve the issues raised in Councilor Scarpelli's letter is to have an outside agency address these issues,

178
00:11:59,878 --> 00:12:02,100
[SPEAKER_14]: and determine the most appropriate way to address these issues.

179
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:08,645
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, therefore, we are resolved that the Medford City Council approve and authorize the Office of the State Auditor to examine the issues set forth in said letter.

180
00:12:08,765 --> 00:12:09,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

181
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:13,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

182
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:16,611
[SPEAKER_06]: The point of my resolution is very simple.

183
00:12:18,132 --> 00:12:23,576
[SPEAKER_06]: This Councilman and I use the words transparency and accountability very often, and I do too.

184
00:12:23,596 --> 00:12:25,638
[SPEAKER_06]: These words count.

185
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:31,157
[SPEAKER_06]: at the count only if we not only talk the talk, but we walk the walk.

186
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:57,908
[SPEAKER_06]: As this City Council is well aware, I submitted a letter to the Attorney General and the State Auditor's Office expressing my concerns over the way the City Council has used Rule 21 in Mass General Law, C-43, Section 22, unfairly and in a self-serving way to eliminate the discussion of resolutions that call for the expenditure of millions upon millions of dollars.

187
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:11,073
[SPEAKER_06]: When papers from the mayor were before the city council on June 7th, the council suspended the rules and approved the motion that the council rule 21 not be allowed to be invoked.

188
00:13:12,394 --> 00:13:26,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Then on June 25th, my request to invoke Mass General Law C-43, section 22, which allows any one council to postpone consideration of a paper for one week was ruled out of order.

189
00:13:27,754 --> 00:13:37,496
[SPEAKER_06]: At both of those meetings, my hope was that we could have an appropriate amount of time to discuss these significant issues and also receive input from our residents.

190
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:48,439
[SPEAKER_06]: When the council leadership ruled my request out of order, I had no choice but to bring this to the attention of the proper state offices to receive their input.

191
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:51,880
[SPEAKER_06]: The state auditor's office responded to me quickly.

192
00:13:53,140 --> 00:14:00,221
[SPEAKER_06]: and reviewed my requests and explained first the requirements of the majority of the city council and the agreement of the mayor to move forward.

193
00:14:01,602 --> 00:14:02,702
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the simple part.

194
00:14:04,262 --> 00:14:16,464
[SPEAKER_06]: If this council feels confident that its actions of those two meetings were correct, then your confidence in your actions can be reflected in your yes vote to allow this review.

195
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:20,285
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be true transparency and accountability.

196
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:36,285
[SPEAKER_06]: If however, you're not confident that the council's action were correct, you should still vote yes for this review because then we will have guidance from the state as opposed to an opinion bought and paid for by attorneys hired by the mayor.

197
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:39,589
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be true transparency and accountability.

198
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:54,300
[SPEAKER_06]: However, if you vote no on this resolution, it will show the residents of our city that this council uses the words transparency and accountability as a punchline that is empty and deceptive.

199
00:14:56,182 --> 00:15:00,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Now is the time to stand up for what you say you believe in.

200
00:15:02,341 --> 00:15:07,123
[SPEAKER_06]: let everyone know the only thing greater than your hollow words is your cowardice.

201
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:20,007
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will tell you, I will ask as a form of a motion that we vote to send this to be reviewed by the auditor, state auditor's office to look at our finances.

202
00:15:20,047 --> 00:15:22,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, again, I'll say it publicly again.

203
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:25,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not one time mentioned

204
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:28,938
[SPEAKER_06]: that there is someone doing something illegal with the city's funds.

205
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:38,522
[SPEAKER_06]: My questions have been and stymied for one factor, one factor only, financial mismanagement.

206
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:41,324
[SPEAKER_06]: So I move that question, Mr. President.

207
00:15:41,344 --> 00:15:46,746
[SPEAKER_14]: I move that Councilor Scarpelli to approve the resolution, seconded by.

208
00:15:52,348 --> 00:15:53,529
[SPEAKER_11]: Second, I'll second it.

209
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:56,355
[SPEAKER_08]: You can.

210
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:57,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

211
00:15:57,696 --> 00:15:58,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we have a second.

212
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

213
00:16:06,003 --> 00:16:09,406
[SPEAKER_02]: President Bears, did Councilor Scarpelli move the question or is debate still out on the floor?

214
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:12,168
[SPEAKER_14]: The Councilor moved to approve.

215
00:16:12,188 --> 00:16:16,532
[SPEAKER_14]: I would, if Councilor has something to say, she can.

216
00:16:16,912 --> 00:16:17,973
[SPEAKER_14]: She did second the motion.

217
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:18,774
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

218
00:16:19,054 --> 00:16:20,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Collins.

219
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:29,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll happily defer to Councilor Callahan while I collect my thoughts.

220
00:16:30,954 --> 00:16:37,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I also reached out after seeing this, I reached out to the State Auditor and I also reached out to the Attorney General.

221
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:50,634
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems quite clear from the letter that Councilor Scarpelli wrote that the request in the letter, and he says right here, to examine the issues set forth in said letter.

222
00:16:51,134 --> 00:17:01,200
[SPEAKER_03]: That letter is to address issues that he mentioned, which include whether the chair properly ruled out of order a certain

223
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:12,187
[SPEAKER_03]: state piece of legislation, C43 section 22 of MTL.

224
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:28,319
[SPEAKER_03]: When I reached out to the state auditor, what the state auditor said was, our office does not conduct audits of city councils, full stop.

225
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:35,559
[SPEAKER_03]: We can, however, conduct audits of cities if requested to do so by a city council.

226
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:44,643
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's something I find very interesting happening here, which is this motion, as written, says that it is to examine the issues set forth in the letter.

227
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:48,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to tell you right now, the state auditor does not do that.

228
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:51,426
[SPEAKER_03]: That is what they told me in writing.

229
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:53,667
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't do that.

230
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:55,188
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a legal question.

231
00:17:56,095 --> 00:18:15,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And Councilor Scarpelli seems to think that for some reason, the contracted legal team, KP Law, because they work for the mayor is different somehow from a city solicitor, which also would work for the administration and for the mayor.

232
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:16,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've talked to

233
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:33,146
[SPEAKER_03]: to city councilors from many cities for many years about the fact that city solicitors do work for the administration, and they tend to, you know, have administration centric ideas right that is a totally normal well understood thing.

234
00:18:33,686 --> 00:18:41,252
[SPEAKER_03]: But this idea that somehow if we had a city solicitor, it would not be hired by the mayor, and yet the KP law is hired by the mayor.

235
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:46,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And so therefore we should never take the opinion of the legal team that we currently have.

236
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:50,159
[SPEAKER_03]: What we need to know and what was in this letter is a legal opinion.

237
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:54,062
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, unfortunately, I did not have time because this

238
00:18:54,702 --> 00:19:08,830
[SPEAKER_03]: was sent out on Friday, and I reached out to them on Monday, and today is Tuesday, so I have not yet spoken to the Attorney General, but I am sure that if what we want is a legal opinion from the state, we can get that legal opinion from the state.

239
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:22,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what's interesting is that the motion that Councilor Scarpelli has now stated is not to examine the issues set forth in said letter, which would be essentially to audit the legal

240
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:33,695
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion in the particular legal statements made by the city council, which the state auditor does not do.

241
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:41,714
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it is to look at our finances around financial mismanagement.

242
00:19:43,094 --> 00:19:49,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that is something that the state auditor can financially audit a city.

243
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:56,277
[SPEAKER_03]: They will charge the municipality, so the taxpayers of Medford will pay for that.

244
00:19:56,297 --> 00:20:02,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

245
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to ask a question.

246
00:20:09,754 --> 00:20:13,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there not a regular audit done of the city every year?

247
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:14,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

248
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:14,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

249
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:19,181
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a regular audit done of the city finances every year.

250
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:22,083
[SPEAKER_14]: The city's finances are audited every year by the independent auditor.

251
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,524
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Vice President Collins.

252
00:20:23,544 --> 00:20:24,705
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Vice President Collins.

253
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:27,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins.

254
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I approve of 100%.

255
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:31,910
[SPEAKER_03]: City's finances should be audited every year and they are.

256
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:33,572
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Collins.

257
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Bears.

258
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:39,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for bringing forward this topic of discussion.

259
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan for your words.

260
00:20:50,271 --> 00:20:51,531
[SPEAKER_02]: Pardon me while I get my thoughts together.

261
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to...

262
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:03,020
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I agree that the words accountability and transparency are used so often that they tend to lose meaning.

263
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:10,104
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in this case, we're kind of having a community-wide discussion about what does transparency look like?

264
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:11,164
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we currently seeing it?

265
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:12,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Where aren't we seeing it that we would like to?

266
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:22,710
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we want the city council to be transparent, then we have to be the forum that states the facts where there's misinformation going around.

267
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:25,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It is true that the city gets audited every year.

268
00:21:26,598 --> 00:21:27,278
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a fact.

269
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:31,561
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not want to be untransparent and pretend that that is not the case.

270
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:32,861
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the case.

271
00:21:33,722 --> 00:21:35,002
[SPEAKER_02]: The city is audited every year.

272
00:21:44,127 --> 00:21:48,789
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me saddened as a member of this council, as a colleague,

273
00:21:51,823 --> 00:21:55,609
[SPEAKER_02]: to see our discussion and debate behind the rail go to this place.

274
00:21:57,672 --> 00:21:59,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I see bodies like this as

275
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,613
[SPEAKER_02]: enacted for the purpose of having disagreement.

276
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:07,595
[SPEAKER_02]: We have had a lot of disagreement this year.

277
00:22:07,835 --> 00:22:10,657
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a lot of disagreement the previous term, my first term.

278
00:22:11,077 --> 00:22:13,239
[SPEAKER_02]: There was plenty of disagreement the term before that.

279
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,000
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not a bug.

280
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,141
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a function.

281
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:27,668
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what democracy looks like, is getting people from the community who disagree with each other to represent the community, to have disagreements and try either by compromise or by vote

282
00:22:29,485 --> 00:22:30,867
[SPEAKER_02]: to find a path forward.

283
00:22:31,488 --> 00:22:34,673
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully a lot of the time we'll find our way to the best path forward.

284
00:22:35,735 --> 00:22:42,826
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we don't, that's why we have elections and new people take these seats and they'll have a disagreements again, and maybe they'll arrive at different

285
00:22:43,868 --> 00:22:47,209
[SPEAKER_02]: decisions by compromise or by vote.

286
00:22:48,209 --> 00:22:58,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's worth noting that the invoking of, I know that there's a couple issues at play here behind what was explicitly written about in the letter.

287
00:22:59,232 --> 00:23:09,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's worth noting that some of the inflammatory motions here that predated Councilor Scarpelli's communication to our partners at the state level,

288
00:23:11,295 --> 00:23:14,498
[SPEAKER_02]: the invoking of Rule 21 and the suspension of Rule 21.

289
00:23:14,758 --> 00:23:17,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to state a few things.

290
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,681
[SPEAKER_02]: One, council rules are council rules.

291
00:23:20,822 --> 00:23:22,604
[SPEAKER_02]: We've amended the council rules in the past.

292
00:23:23,084 --> 00:23:25,125
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be put forward by any councillor.

293
00:23:25,386 --> 00:23:28,988
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a thing that councillors are allowed to do and that we vote on them.

294
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:36,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think it's worth noting that rules have been suspended for time immemorial, at least as long as I've been paying attention.

295
00:23:36,974 --> 00:23:37,694
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not new.

296
00:23:38,455 --> 00:23:41,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Rule 21 has been invoked since I started paying attention.

297
00:23:41,657 --> 00:23:43,338
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not new.

298
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:45,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Rules have been suspended for various reasons.

299
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,643
[SPEAKER_02]: For as long as I've been watching these meetings, that's not new.

300
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:55,387
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, when I look at the current climate,

301
00:23:56,377 --> 00:24:23,582
[SPEAKER_02]: behind this rail at this team of people who were elected to work together and disagree together and take votes together, makes me wonder what's changed that instead of taking votes and moving on, taking votes and trying to find compromise and using the forum of the debate to try to be persuasive, try to listen in good faith and talk in good faith, you know,

302
00:24:26,906 --> 00:24:27,927
[SPEAKER_02]: This is hard for me to do.

303
00:24:29,988 --> 00:24:37,233
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people behind this rail are speaking my mind, so I think that it's only fair that in the spirit of productive disagreement, you know, we do the same.

304
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:40,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important.

305
00:24:41,016 --> 00:24:48,340
[SPEAKER_02]: that any member who finds themselves on the losing side of any vote to see that for what it is.

306
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:57,285
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they owe it to this body to continue in the spirit of productive disagreement, not to gum up the works of the body through

307
00:24:59,918 --> 00:25:08,503
[SPEAKER_02]: making allegations or accusations of inappropriate behavior, of breaking of the rules, of inappropriateness.

308
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:12,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is harmful to what this body does.

309
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:13,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's fair.

310
00:25:13,886 --> 00:25:16,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's good sportsmanship.

311
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:17,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it helps this community.

312
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:19,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that

313
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:33,588
[SPEAKER_02]: after this spate of, frankly, misinformation that this community has been weathering and conversing about for the past couple of months, we can get back to a place where we say, we want this body to be productive.

314
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:35,689
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to sling mud at each other.

315
00:25:35,709 --> 00:25:46,678
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to use our state-level partners as a forum for trying to bring each other down by claiming inappropriateness.

316
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:51,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's debate, let's discuss, let's disagree, let's yell at each other if we have to.

317
00:25:52,192 --> 00:25:53,432
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nothing new.

318
00:25:54,152 --> 00:26:02,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let's take the votes and move on and let's remember that we're all here because of votes that were cast.

319
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:04,134
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happens every two years.

320
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:11,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think it is helpful for our community at all to let

321
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:27,445
[SPEAKER_02]: these accusations of inappropriateness and illegality or allegations that heavily imply inappropriateness and illegality into the conversation.

322
00:26:27,505 --> 00:26:32,809
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that is in the best interest of this body, which continues as a body after all of our terms are over.

323
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:33,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

324
00:26:35,311 --> 00:26:37,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

325
00:26:38,834 --> 00:26:39,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Lazzaro, no?

326
00:26:40,455 --> 00:26:41,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Scarpelli.

327
00:26:43,173 --> 00:26:49,820
[SPEAKER_03]: I would simply want to understand, because it is not at all clear to me, which of these two things we're actually voting on.

328
00:26:50,061 --> 00:27:00,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we voting on for the state auditor to examine the issue set forth in said letter, which is what is written, which I'm pretty sure they will not do, because that's not what they do, or are we voting on them to look at our finances

329
00:27:01,232 --> 00:27:06,116
[SPEAKER_03]: which was what Scarpelli said out loud, which we already do every single year.

330
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:14,021
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really having trouble imagining why we would want to pay the state to do a second audit when we already do them every single year.

331
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:16,683
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would wanna know which of those we're voting on if there's gonna be a motion.

332
00:27:16,763 --> 00:27:17,544
[SPEAKER_03]: I am unclear.

333
00:27:17,564 --> 00:27:19,085
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli, then Councilor Tseng.

334
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:22,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me make it very clear then.

335
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:30,053
[SPEAKER_06]: In both the letter and in the resolution, I asked for examination on everything possible, period.

336
00:27:30,825 --> 00:27:44,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I want the examination of our city finances, and I'll be meeting tomorrow with the Attorney General's office and talking about the legalities of the processes we have here.

337
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:55,823
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's funny, Mr. President, that my fellow Councilors mentioned some pretty outrageous comments, like as this was something that wouldn't happen.

338
00:27:57,664 --> 00:27:58,204
[SPEAKER_06]: This happened.

339
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:00,146
[SPEAKER_06]: The last four meetings,

340
00:28:04,591 --> 00:28:08,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you don't have YouTube, but Councilor Lennon made sure everybody knows.

341
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Our meetings are on YouTube now.

342
00:28:10,978 --> 00:28:11,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch those meetings.

343
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,621
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny, Councilor Collins.

344
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:17,906
[SPEAKER_06]: You tell me about working together and council rules.

345
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:22,291
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's funny that you talk about disagreements.

346
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course we've had disagreements.

347
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:29,204
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course we sat across an issue and one lost and one won.

348
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:30,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course they did.

349
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:38,010
[SPEAKER_06]: But never, ever, ever has a sitting council been silenced the way this council has silenced me.

350
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:54,125
[SPEAKER_06]: no different than Councilor Callahan speaking about, it seems to fit the narrative whenever it suits your mission.

351
00:28:55,146 --> 00:29:10,118
[SPEAKER_06]: But I remember when we had an issue concerning a legality dealing with a newsletter, and I said something very simple in regards also to the letter that was sent out to the state regarding the transfer tax.

352
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:12,261
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a city solicitor.

353
00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:17,123
[SPEAKER_06]: I made a motion that we ask for an opinion from our legal team here.

354
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:18,943
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe you voted no.

355
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:21,344
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe all of you voted no.

356
00:29:22,544 --> 00:29:23,944
[SPEAKER_06]: And that stymied the talk.

357
00:29:24,665 --> 00:29:29,226
[SPEAKER_06]: That stymied the process that you yourself just said.

358
00:29:30,566 --> 00:29:40,451
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you sit back and you start talking and you're spewing to the public that this is divisive, that this isn't true, oh, these are all true.

359
00:29:40,991 --> 00:29:41,871
[SPEAKER_06]: These aren't made up.

360
00:29:43,212 --> 00:29:48,995
[SPEAKER_06]: You suspended the rules so rule 21 could not be invoked.

361
00:29:50,595 --> 00:29:57,959
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking about millions and millions of dollars that this council got on a Friday and voted on a Tuesday.

362
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:01,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what you talk about transparency and accountability?

363
00:30:02,294 --> 00:30:02,694
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

364
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:10,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And instead of walking it through with this open, deliberate conversation, as you just well stated, we did it.

365
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:12,339
[SPEAKER_06]: We shut it down.

366
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,622
[SPEAKER_06]: We disrespected this councilor and my ability to work for not the 7,000 people,

367
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:32,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Not for the 7,000 people that elected you when you knocked on their doors, but when I put my hand up and I swore to uphold the rules and regulations and laws of this city, I represent all 60,000 members of this community.

368
00:30:43,425 --> 00:31:02,212
[SPEAKER_06]: So to sit back and spew this disingenuine dialogue that these are lies, that what I'm saying is mistruths, these are situations risen on the fact that you, as the leadership team of this council, you stymied the process of open discussion.

369
00:31:03,272 --> 00:31:03,813
[SPEAKER_06]: You did.

370
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:06,654
[SPEAKER_06]: You forced me to go out and ask.

371
00:31:08,194 --> 00:31:13,499
[SPEAKER_06]: In regards to my fellow Councilor reaching out to the art of his office, great job.

372
00:31:14,932 --> 00:31:21,156
[SPEAKER_06]: I forwarded our city clerk the email that was sent, so I could share that with everybody.

373
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:21,976
[SPEAKER_06]: When did you forward that?

374
00:31:22,276 --> 00:31:22,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, just now.

375
00:31:22,716 --> 00:31:24,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got it, so I just forwarded it.

376
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:26,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, Councilor Scarpelli.

377
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your correspondence.

378
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:40,627
[SPEAKER_06]: In order for our office to examine these issues, we would need the request for the city of Medford itself, and then it broke down, which Councilor Callahan so eloquently said, it's the vote of the council,

379
00:31:41,755 --> 00:31:42,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Then it's the vote of the mayor.

380
00:31:43,877 --> 00:31:46,540
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, the city would have to pay for that.

381
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,685
[SPEAKER_06]: And oh, by the way, yes, the city does do an audit every year.

382
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:59,733
[SPEAKER_06]: The questions that I would have brought up that evening and the previous meetings before that, that I was silenced.

383
00:32:00,748 --> 00:32:09,591
[SPEAKER_06]: We looked at situations where we had millions of dollars in other avenues that we can make our school system whole to protect our students, our teachers, and our community.

384
00:32:10,351 --> 00:32:11,311
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was stunned.

385
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:18,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Then the following week, we got the email, right, that we just found another $9 million, $9 million in free cash.

386
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,551
[SPEAKER_06]: $34 million in free cash.

387
00:32:25,172 --> 00:32:34,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's an opportunity to openly discuss, transparently, with accountability, discuss this process and say, where did it come from?

388
00:32:35,082 --> 00:32:35,903
[SPEAKER_06]: How did this happen?

389
00:32:38,385 --> 00:32:41,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Why can't we use this to support the education process now?

390
00:32:42,622 --> 00:33:00,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what has happened, maybe you stick with your 7,000 people you knock on their doors, but you've woken up this community to the fact that whether you believed in an override or you didn't, people are questioning this community's process of fiscal mismanagement.

391
00:33:01,642 --> 00:33:02,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Period.

392
00:33:07,939 --> 00:33:08,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

393
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng.

394
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:17,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So to call this, sorry, not Council President, to call these allegations, I think it's just disingenuine.

395
00:33:17,964 --> 00:33:18,984
[SPEAKER_06]: These aren't allegations.

396
00:33:19,004 --> 00:33:28,849
[SPEAKER_06]: What you're saying in actuality, what I put out there, what I've tried to say for the last four meetings were lies and I made them up.

397
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:31,150
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's simply not true, Councilor.

398
00:33:31,823 --> 00:33:33,384
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm ashamed that you even brought that up.

399
00:33:33,984 --> 00:33:36,665
[SPEAKER_06]: You could go to every single meeting and watch it yourself.

400
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:45,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And all I had were questions that my constituents, our constituents in the city of Medford, were asking me for answers.

401
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:58,336
[SPEAKER_06]: And all it could have been, even that evening, when we questioned yours and Council President Bezos' signatures with your titles on that letter that supported a transfer tax.

402
00:33:59,463 --> 00:34:08,430
[SPEAKER_06]: All that could have been done was a simple yes vote, voted to legal, them telling me this is what it is, Councilor Scarpelli, and we moved forward.

403
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:13,034
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have an answer for multiple constituents that called me about that.

404
00:34:13,574 --> 00:34:15,596
[SPEAKER_06]: No different than this situation or what we did.

405
00:34:18,746 --> 00:34:19,807
[SPEAKER_06]: You made it a mockery.

406
00:34:20,247 --> 00:34:21,928
[SPEAKER_06]: The night of the budget was a mockery.

407
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:25,631
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to talk about a disgrace in a Zoom, in a show?

408
00:34:25,832 --> 00:34:26,652
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a show.

409
00:34:27,673 --> 00:34:31,856
[SPEAKER_06]: The mail with the snide comments and the linking back and forth, disgusting.

410
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:33,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Disgusting.

411
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:34,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the video.

412
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:37,321
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys look perplexed like this never happened.

413
00:34:37,401 --> 00:34:39,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back to YouTube and watch it.

414
00:34:40,063 --> 00:34:43,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead and watch it because it's disgusting and it's appalling.

415
00:34:43,606 --> 00:34:47,208
[SPEAKER_06]: So to sit back and call this, these allegations,

416
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:50,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I protested that vehemently.

417
00:34:51,388 --> 00:34:52,329
[SPEAKER_06]: These are truths.

418
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And you forced me.

419
00:34:57,032 --> 00:35:00,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, again, again, I'll leave it at this.

420
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:03,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I made the motion.

421
00:35:04,398 --> 00:35:07,620
[SPEAKER_06]: We sent the letter to the attorney general and the auditor's office.

422
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,822
[SPEAKER_06]: The attorney general hasn't gotten back to me yet.

423
00:35:09,842 --> 00:35:11,363
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll meet him tomorrow, we hope.

424
00:35:13,084 --> 00:35:16,567
[SPEAKER_06]: The auditor's office responded.

425
00:35:17,472 --> 00:35:25,922
[SPEAKER_06]: The response that I got that I shared explained the hows and the what to dos with this process.

426
00:35:27,144 --> 00:35:31,389
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why this motion has come up that we vote on

427
00:35:32,705 --> 00:35:51,891
[SPEAKER_06]: passing this over to the mayor, having the mayor make a decision, sending it to the auditor's office, and then having them come in to look and see, not what the audit that we're seeing done when everything is prepared, but at the end of the year, when we find $9 million of mismanagement funds.

428
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:59,793
[SPEAKER_06]: That's unheard of, because as most people in this administration love to do, they contact neighborhood communities.

429
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:00,974
[SPEAKER_06]: They love to put these charts up.

430
00:36:01,354 --> 00:36:01,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I did that.

431
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:09,982
[SPEAKER_06]: The average increase in free cash in neighboring communities are no more than $4 to $5 million, and that's excessive.

432
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:14,825
[SPEAKER_06]: We're looking at $34 million.

433
00:36:16,005 --> 00:36:18,106
[SPEAKER_06]: And you people stifled me.

434
00:36:18,487 --> 00:36:20,948
[SPEAKER_06]: You shut me down that we couldn't talk about it.

435
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Those aren't allegations.

436
00:36:24,283 --> 00:36:25,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are truths.

437
00:36:25,865 --> 00:36:26,405
[SPEAKER_06]: I know hate.

438
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:27,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they hurt.

439
00:36:28,307 --> 00:36:33,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I know when this comes out, I know that it hurts me, Council President.

440
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:36,774
[SPEAKER_06]: It hurts me because I was voted just like all of you.

441
00:36:37,435 --> 00:36:48,044
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was voted, but when I took the seat, I made sure whether a person agreed with me or not, that I made a decision what I think was best for the whole community, all 60,000.

442
00:36:50,216 --> 00:36:53,018
[SPEAKER_06]: But from what we hear from my fellow councilors, that's not true.

443
00:36:53,598 --> 00:36:54,839
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will tell you this.

444
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,620
[SPEAKER_06]: This will move forward.

445
00:36:57,801 --> 00:36:58,562
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll go to a vote.

446
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:00,203
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm very clear on the vote now.

447
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:01,223
[SPEAKER_06]: It's examination.

448
00:37:01,483 --> 00:37:13,992
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the motion to have the auditor, this council, to vote to allow the state to come in and put through an audit through the state to see where we are and what's been happening with our funds.

449
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:15,571
[SPEAKER_06]: period.

450
00:37:16,432 --> 00:37:29,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, moving forward with the Attorney General's office, we'll see what they say about the management and the style that this Council President used over the last few weeks.

451
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:33,624
[SPEAKER_06]: That has been an absolute atrocious display of leadership.

452
00:37:34,364 --> 00:37:41,618
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'll come out in the next meeting, and I'll make sure I'm a little clearer for everybody when the Attorney General answers those questions.

453
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:42,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

454
00:37:43,101 --> 00:37:43,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

455
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:55,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Number one, if you can share the correspondence with your fellow Councilors that you've been having, that would be helpful for us to understand the impact.

456
00:37:55,235 --> 00:37:56,016
[SPEAKER_14]: I did, you got it.

457
00:37:56,336 --> 00:37:56,837
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you didn't.

458
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:00,600
[SPEAKER_14]: You got the letter.

459
00:38:01,241 --> 00:38:03,783
[SPEAKER_06]: You got the letter the morning I sent it through the clerk.

460
00:38:04,244 --> 00:38:05,665
[SPEAKER_06]: So you saw that.

461
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:06,346
[SPEAKER_06]: So you saw that.

462
00:38:06,566 --> 00:38:11,370
[SPEAKER_06]: And the response from the, the response from

463
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:17,751
[SPEAKER_06]: The auditor, I had it this week, and I forwarded tonight.

464
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:19,072
[SPEAKER_06]: You forwarded at what time?

465
00:38:19,793 --> 00:38:20,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, just now.

466
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:21,034
[SPEAKER_06]: During the meeting.

467
00:38:21,114 --> 00:38:21,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just now.

468
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:22,134
[SPEAKER_06]: You got it.

469
00:38:22,194 --> 00:38:24,056
[SPEAKER_14]: So we haven't had a chance to review it before the meeting.

470
00:38:24,076 --> 00:38:25,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so that's what you're going to win on.

471
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:28,138
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's how you're going to play the gutter ball, you've got me.

472
00:38:28,158 --> 00:38:28,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just asking.

473
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:29,579
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got me, bud.

474
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:30,160
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

475
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,080
[SPEAKER_07]: You got me.

476
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's outline here.

477
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:33,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's outline here.

478
00:38:34,102 --> 00:38:39,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Before I open my mouth, let me start off with number one, I'm going to lose inside a lot of votes in this chamber.

479
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,522
[SPEAKER_11]: In any case, what happened here, number one, there was a motion.

480
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:46,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Rule 21 was invoked on a Councilor Scarpelli paper.

481
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:07,860
[SPEAKER_14]: which moved it to another week.

482
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,530
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe Councilor Scaparro then withdrew the paper without any discussion.

483
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,320
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we talk about being stymied from discussion.

484
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,541
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of personal privilege.

485
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't use my name.

486
00:39:15,681 --> 00:39:17,101
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of personal privilege.

487
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:18,922
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the law between the doors.

488
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of personal privilege.

489
00:39:20,882 --> 00:39:21,942
[SPEAKER_07]: You use my name.

490
00:39:22,082 --> 00:39:23,102
[SPEAKER_07]: You use my name.

491
00:39:23,182 --> 00:39:24,383
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will answer it.

492
00:39:24,743 --> 00:39:26,343
[SPEAKER_07]: You said that evening.

493
00:39:26,443 --> 00:39:27,903
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a point of personal privilege.

494
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:30,224
[SPEAKER_07]: You obviously don't know who you are.

495
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:31,344
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the chair.

496
00:39:31,664 --> 00:39:32,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

497
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:35,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Please recognize the law that indicates that I'm the chair.

498
00:39:35,385 --> 00:39:36,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one.

499
00:39:40,706 --> 00:39:43,607
[SPEAKER_08]: We were stymied from discussing that and it was withdrawn unilaterally.

500
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:50,330
[SPEAKER_14]: This council voted in an open and transparent session, and I have spoken to legal counsel about this, to suspend the rules.

501
00:39:52,211 --> 00:39:53,331
[SPEAKER_14]: That happened at the first time.

502
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:55,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scott probably asked many questions on the items.

503
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:58,273
[SPEAKER_14]: He was not stymied from asking those questions.

504
00:39:58,313 --> 00:39:59,074
[SPEAKER_14]: They were discussed.

505
00:39:59,923 --> 00:40:02,065
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing that changed is that it couldn't have been postponed.

506
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:03,846
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the June 11th meeting.

507
00:40:04,307 --> 00:40:18,739
[SPEAKER_14]: At the June 25th meeting, the rules were again suspended to avoid postponement to beyond the fiscal year deadline, at which point there couldn't have been action taken and the free cash would not have been able to be accessed, putting the city in financial peril.

508
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,603
[SPEAKER_14]: In any case, rules were suspended in an open and transparent session.

509
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,805
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a motion, there was an invocation.

510
00:40:27,825 --> 00:40:30,306
[SPEAKER_14]: I ruled, there was a vote of the council.

511
00:40:30,606 --> 00:40:35,629
[SPEAKER_14]: The council made a vote that was taken in an open session and then moved forward.

512
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,052
[SPEAKER_14]: At that point, council, at that point, Councilor Scarpellioli left the meeting.

513
00:40:40,892 --> 00:40:46,776
[SPEAKER_14]: So when we talk about not having our voice heard, you have to be present in the room to ask the questions.

514
00:40:47,881 --> 00:40:49,722
[SPEAKER_06]: When not, I'm going to Councilor Tseng.

515
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:53,744
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, President Beres.

516
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:59,607
[SPEAKER_18]: Lots being said tonight, and I think we need to unpack this resolution a little bit.

517
00:41:01,914 --> 00:41:05,017
[SPEAKER_18]: ultimately seems like there's a legal question and political question here.

518
00:41:05,317 --> 00:41:13,145
[SPEAKER_18]: And the resolution put in front of us, and the way it was put in front of us, I think, presented it as a legal question.

519
00:41:13,545 --> 00:41:19,731
[SPEAKER_18]: But the comments from the Councilor proposing this resolution tonight seem to have taken it in a political direction.

520
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:20,532
[SPEAKER_18]: And

521
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:30,009
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, when it comes to that political direction, that political question, I think we've been very clear that we are audited regularly, annually by an independent auditor.

522
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:40,134
[SPEAKER_18]: And it would be quite an ask to take this one step further, given what we all know about the budget.

523
00:41:40,654 --> 00:41:44,837
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, what the text of this resolution is, is a legal question.

524
00:41:45,657 --> 00:41:48,459
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's how I will be making my vote tonight.

525
00:41:49,079 --> 00:42:01,924
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I think the rhetoric from some folks seems to want to back the council into a yes vote with some questions framed to get us to vote a certain way.

526
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:12,867
[SPEAKER_18]: But ultimately, because this is a legal matter, I think what truly matters here, the first question we have to ask is about the legitimacy of the allegations being charged.

527
00:42:14,748 --> 00:42:15,969
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this a legitimate question?

528
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:19,793
[SPEAKER_18]: Is this the path forward, if that is the legitimate question?

529
00:42:20,734 --> 00:42:25,198
[SPEAKER_18]: And why don't we just ask the AG for a legal opinion, right?

530
00:42:25,899 --> 00:42:30,203
[SPEAKER_18]: I think, furthermore, on the topic of legitimacy, let's unpack this one step further.

531
00:42:31,237 --> 00:42:34,839
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we've been very clear that the council rules can be suspended.

532
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,141
[SPEAKER_18]: This is regularly, we do this at almost every single meeting.

533
00:42:38,802 --> 00:42:57,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I wanna speak from my perspective, why I've voted to suspend this, because I come from a different position or I actually don't know where my other councillors stand on this, but I don't think rule 21 is a rule that pursues transparency or accountability.

534
00:42:58,274 --> 00:43:00,576
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's just take that budget meeting that we're talking about.

535
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:11,929
[SPEAKER_18]: Hundreds of people attended that budget meeting in person and on Zoom, expecting us to take those votes, the budget votes and the proposition votes that night.

536
00:43:12,952 --> 00:43:25,117
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, oftentimes, when we suspend rules, when we table items, I get emails and phone calls asking why we've done that, why they haven't seen a final vote on it.

537
00:43:25,557 --> 00:43:34,641
[SPEAKER_18]: Residents first get confused, and then they get frustrated, and then they feel cut out of the political process because they don't understand what's going on.

538
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:36,481
[SPEAKER_18]: They've taken this time to come to a meeting.

539
00:43:36,922 --> 00:43:39,282
[SPEAKER_18]: They've hired a babysitter to come in for that night.

540
00:43:41,698 --> 00:43:47,301
[SPEAKER_18]: they're expected to do that two weeks later, to do that another week, to do that on and on and on.

541
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:50,762
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is not a fair ask of our residents.

542
00:43:51,482 --> 00:44:07,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Now on top of that, the letter that the councilor sent to the attorney general and the state auditor didn't only mention Rule 21, but also mentioned vast general law, a certain section which I don't know off the top of my head, but has been said over and over tonight.

543
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:13,253
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, at our previous meeting, we read out that section of the law.

544
00:44:13,473 --> 00:44:32,183
[SPEAKER_18]: We walked through it, clause by clause, explained it, and it was evident from the language of the law itself that it applied to getting three vote items, or three items that required three readings, voted in one night.

545
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:34,940
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what that law applies to.

546
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:41,742
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not any willy nilly thing that we pass on to the agenda that shows up as a resolution.

547
00:44:42,102 --> 00:44:46,364
[SPEAKER_18]: It applies to resolutions and papers that require three votes.

548
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:53,226
[SPEAKER_18]: And that law gives city councils, it empowers city councils to pass those three reading items in one night.

549
00:44:55,632 --> 00:44:59,875
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, that wasn't what the Councilor tried to apply that state law for.

550
00:45:00,535 --> 00:45:04,377
[SPEAKER_18]: We tried to explain that to my fellow Councilor.

551
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:08,420
[SPEAKER_18]: And understandably, it was not heard.

552
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,542
[SPEAKER_18]: But I can't change what the law says.

553
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:13,483
[SPEAKER_18]: The law says what it says.

554
00:45:13,763 --> 00:45:15,804
[SPEAKER_18]: It applies to that very specific case.

555
00:45:17,365 --> 00:45:21,047
[SPEAKER_18]: And so ultimately, this then becomes null.

556
00:45:21,348 --> 00:45:22,228
[SPEAKER_18]: It becomes void.

557
00:45:22,388 --> 00:45:23,409
[SPEAKER_18]: It becomes illegitimate.

558
00:45:24,269 --> 00:45:40,560
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, I think on going back to some of the questions about finances and whatnot, if we have personal questions, and Councilor Lummi explained this at the last meeting, and this is what I do, and this is what I know other councilors do.

559
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:46,184
[SPEAKER_18]: If we have questions as a city councilor about the things that we are voting on, it behooves us.

560
00:45:46,824 --> 00:45:54,129
[SPEAKER_18]: We have the power to pick up our phone, to dial a number of city staff and call in and ask those questions about our city staff.

561
00:45:57,793 --> 00:46:05,162
[SPEAKER_18]: And that is just part of the political process.

562
00:46:06,143 --> 00:46:09,788
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, if there was a legitimate legal question here, I would be happy to vote yes.

563
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:25,754
[SPEAKER_18]: But we cannot go down the path of indecision and logjamming ourselves because of bad faith attempts to stall simple work that city councils have regularly done and regularly do, including the city council before any of us were elected.

564
00:46:26,594 --> 00:46:33,276
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, if there was a real violation of the First Amendment right to free speech, I would take that as an affront to democracy.

565
00:46:34,178 --> 00:46:45,203
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think folks who tune in week in and week out will find that there is no shortage of free speech in the city council, especially from my fellow city councilor.

566
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:52,946
[SPEAKER_18]: I worry that a vote forward on this would open a Pandora's box of allegations and rhetoric and tools.

567
00:46:54,167 --> 00:46:58,849
[SPEAKER_18]: The spying work being done in any direction from the city council and

568
00:46:59,468 --> 00:47:15,541
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, my hope is, especially given the events of the last few weeks, that we tone down our political tenor and tone down our political rhetoric to stop the finger pointing, to take a step back and learn how to disagree respectfully.

569
00:47:17,983 --> 00:47:18,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Sen.

570
00:47:18,804 --> 00:47:19,844
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Collins.

571
00:47:22,687 --> 00:47:23,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Beasley.

572
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you to all those who have spoken.

573
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Bearsley, you have a minute.

574
00:47:28,651 --> 00:47:28,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

575
00:47:29,588 --> 00:47:29,728
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

576
00:47:31,029 --> 00:47:33,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, council, please.

577
00:47:39,471 --> 00:47:46,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that being behind this rail carries a lot of responsibility, collectively and individually.

578
00:47:47,674 --> 00:47:57,678
[SPEAKER_02]: When I speak about allegations, part of what I mean is that the narrative that we perpetuate as individuals and as a collective, we are responsible for that.

579
00:47:57,698 --> 00:47:59,018
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very powerful in the community.

580
00:48:00,762 --> 00:48:13,486
[SPEAKER_02]: The allegation, I think, is the narrative that has been created to draw a link between some of these events that a councilor is mentioning in past meetings.

581
00:48:17,247 --> 00:48:26,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it is responsible to further a false narrative that actions taken by this council are towards the goal of silencing an opinion.

582
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:30,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna briefly walk through a few items.

583
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:42,728
[SPEAKER_02]: One, and what I mean by the narrative is I think that what we're kind of all talking around is this narrative of one Councilor is being willfully silenced by collective actions of another.

584
00:48:44,028 --> 00:48:45,369
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a very compelling narrative.

585
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,671
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very compelling story.

586
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,952
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna keep talking.

587
00:48:49,972 --> 00:48:51,693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna keep talking.

588
00:49:03,968 --> 00:49:09,673
[SPEAKER_02]: The first meeting, Rule 21 was invoked to delay the free cash paper by one meeting.

589
00:49:09,693 --> 00:49:13,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to remind people that Rule 21 is an undebatable motion.

590
00:49:13,277 --> 00:49:17,741
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not the case that this is a collective action taken to silence that idea.

591
00:49:18,702 --> 00:49:19,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Frankly, not that it matters.

592
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't in favor of tabling

593
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:23,669
[SPEAKER_02]: the free cash.

594
00:49:24,009 --> 00:49:26,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't like that that happened.

595
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:26,750
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't matter.

596
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:27,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It's undebatable.

597
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:28,411
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened.

598
00:49:28,471 --> 00:49:29,891
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a collective action.

599
00:49:29,911 --> 00:49:38,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the councilor's intentions in doing it, but it doesn't fit this narrative of collective action to silence one group, one person, or a constituency.

600
00:49:40,014 --> 00:49:47,236
[SPEAKER_02]: At the next meeting, yes, I suspended the rules to say that we can't do rule 21 at this meeting.

601
00:49:47,856 --> 00:49:49,697
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, I am not a fan of rule 21.

602
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:52,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's productive.

603
00:49:53,729 --> 00:49:58,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's something we should discuss as a council, whether it's worth keeping inside of our council rules.

604
00:49:58,676 --> 00:50:07,327
[SPEAKER_02]: My explicit reason for doing it at that meeting was not to be a part of a coordinated effort to silence one person, group, or constituency, but because

605
00:50:08,396 --> 00:50:24,128
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my understanding, and I believe this is true, that if we were to delay the budget past, if we were to not vote on the budget at that meeting, that would have pushed us past the deadline of issuing pink slips to teachers.

606
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:32,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if rule 21 had been invoked and we had tabled the budget, a lot of teachers would have gotten pink slips.

607
00:50:33,737 --> 00:50:36,460
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have to, because the budget wouldn't have been finalized.

608
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,004
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my understanding, and that was my motivation for taking Rule 21 off of the table.

609
00:50:41,704 --> 00:50:50,352
[SPEAKER_02]: You can disagree with it, but it doesn't fit the narrative of just being a coordinated effort to silence one person, group, or constituency, and I won't further that narrative.

610
00:50:51,013 --> 00:50:53,094
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing I want to say while I have the floor,

611
00:50:54,557 --> 00:50:59,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a perpetual thorn in our side, this issue of free cash.

612
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:04,766
[SPEAKER_02]: One, because it's called such a confusing and inaccurate term, free cash.

613
00:51:06,768 --> 00:51:07,148
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

614
00:51:07,349 --> 00:51:08,530
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the community's cash.

615
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,652
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the reserve fund, actually.

616
00:51:15,556 --> 00:51:16,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to finish.

617
00:51:16,817 --> 00:51:17,718
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to finish my point.

618
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:27,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Free cash occurs when money that was budgeted to be spent was not spent.

619
00:51:27,768 --> 00:51:38,274
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true that we have allocated up until our last city council meeting when we appropriated some of that free cash, that it is amassed to a very large number.

620
00:51:39,034 --> 00:51:45,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are some neighboring communities have a balance of four or five million in free cash at a given time and we had 34?

621
00:51:45,818 --> 00:51:47,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we were one of the,

622
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:55,305
[SPEAKER_02]: 3% of cities and towns in Massachusetts that had never ever set up a stabilization fund, which is a savings account.

623
00:51:55,365 --> 00:52:13,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why ours was growing and growing and growing, essentially in a checking account, a checking account that you can't use most of the year, instead of being appropriated into funds and departments where it can actually go to work for you, the taxpayers, for us, for our city departments.

624
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:27,064
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why that number grew so large, because we never appropriated it into a stabilization fund or a capital stabilization fund, both of which are mechanisms that we set up at the last meeting in June.

625
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:36,067
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanna add a little bit of, I just wanted to add that context to the discussion, because I can totally understand that it sounds egregious to say we have $34 million.

626
00:52:36,307 --> 00:52:41,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, my analogy, I'm not a finance expert, is to say we have $34 million in a checking account,

627
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:43,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Why the heck would that be?

628
00:52:44,249 --> 00:52:45,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now we don't.

629
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:52,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we've put it into funds where it can actually go to use for the city, for the schools, for the taxpayers because of votes taken at the last meeting in June.

630
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:59,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's important because now it can actually be put to use for the residents and taxpayers of Medford.

631
00:53:03,606 --> 00:53:08,951
[SPEAKER_14]: We can take a recess if we're going to continue to have anti-democratic disruptions of this public meeting.

632
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:12,472
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not, actually.

633
00:53:12,492 --> 00:53:15,875
[SPEAKER_14]: As the chair, we need to have a respectful decorum.

634
00:53:16,355 --> 00:53:17,677
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm moving a five minute recess.

635
00:57:46,681 --> 00:57:48,844
[SPEAKER_13]: That was our first actually five-minute recess.

636
00:57:49,325 --> 00:57:51,788
[SPEAKER_14]: We are not going to entertain further disruptions.

637
00:57:52,529 --> 00:57:54,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Collins, you have the floor.

638
00:57:56,454 --> 00:57:57,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Paris.

639
00:57:58,137 --> 00:57:58,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I had finished my point.

640
00:57:58,998 --> 00:58:00,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

641
00:58:01,982 --> 00:58:02,883
[SPEAKER_14]: You done, Vice President Collins?

642
00:58:03,786 --> 00:58:04,787
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

643
00:58:04,907 --> 00:58:05,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

644
00:58:06,248 --> 00:58:09,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to address a couple of the comments that people use my name directly.

645
00:58:10,870 --> 00:58:29,061
[SPEAKER_06]: On that first meeting, when we started the discussion talking about possibly using the free cash and being stymied, and then stopping that conversation because we all knew the process the following week would be the process.

646
00:58:29,141 --> 00:58:33,144
[SPEAKER_06]: The next meeting would be to talk about the budget and possibly vote.

647
00:58:35,418 --> 00:58:46,643
[SPEAKER_06]: When we attended the next following meeting, which allows me to then discuss that resolution that I put forth, I took it off the table.

648
00:58:47,543 --> 00:58:53,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I took it off the table to eliminate the nonsense that was already passed.

649
00:58:57,067 --> 00:59:04,430
[SPEAKER_06]: The idea to send a resolution through and explain the resolution, the option of thought process of one Councilor, who by the way,

650
00:59:06,238 --> 00:59:12,462
[SPEAKER_06]: understands that sometimes it's inconvenient for people that come to a vote to 100 people.

651
00:59:13,522 --> 00:59:29,672
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you have the responsibility of thousands of people and making sure that we're doing our due diligence with all of the finances and all the financial questions we have, that I took it off the table because it was too late.

652
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:43,124
[SPEAKER_06]: My motion that was presented the week before was to discuss the process so we can sit with the mayor and understand the process and get some answers so we can move it forward one way or the other.

653
00:59:44,064 --> 00:59:45,544
[SPEAKER_06]: But that was stymied, that was stopped.

654
00:59:47,225 --> 00:59:55,587
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wasn't that I stopped that meeting because of lack of transparency or didn't want to openly discuss something.

655
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:57,668
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a moot point, we moved on.

656
00:59:59,201 --> 01:00:05,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything I said there eliminated anything we could do because the mayor was ready to move on her votes.

657
01:00:06,408 --> 01:00:09,211
[SPEAKER_06]: So understand that, that's very important.

658
01:00:10,992 --> 01:00:21,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, let me share some shocking, sometimes the administration doesn't tell us the truth.

659
01:00:22,884 --> 01:00:38,293
[SPEAKER_06]: So you realize that even though you rushed the vote, even though we realized we got information about finances no more than a few days prior to that, that there were still multiple layoffs and we lost many, many teachers.

660
01:00:39,493 --> 01:00:42,515
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a lie.

661
01:00:44,776 --> 01:00:45,857
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not an option.

662
01:00:46,117 --> 01:00:51,520
[SPEAKER_06]: We could have waited and move this out a week after and got the information that all of our citizens wanted.

663
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:58,381
[SPEAKER_06]: not the 200 people that were here that found babysitters, but everybody, that's our responsibility.

664
01:00:59,361 --> 01:01:00,182
[SPEAKER_06]: But we didn't do that.

665
01:01:02,122 --> 01:01:06,864
[SPEAKER_06]: You made a choice to service the people that service you.

666
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:09,925
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's blatant.

667
01:01:11,165 --> 01:01:18,028
[SPEAKER_06]: You talk about, Councilor Tseng talks about just picking up the phone, call the departments.

668
01:01:19,708 --> 01:01:21,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't trust the departments.

669
01:01:25,987 --> 01:01:27,728
[SPEAKER_06]: They work for the mayor.

670
01:01:28,229 --> 01:01:33,092
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I say I don't trust the departments, I speak with the rank and file.

671
01:01:34,173 --> 01:01:35,574
[SPEAKER_06]: And they privately talk to me.

672
01:01:38,116 --> 01:01:42,059
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can't use their names because they're afraid of what goes up here.

673
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:45,682
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not throwing fuel on a fire.

674
01:01:45,983 --> 01:01:47,023
[SPEAKER_06]: You asked the question.

675
01:01:47,043 --> 01:01:51,227
[SPEAKER_06]: You brought up the question why I simply didn't go to these department heads and talk to them.

676
01:01:52,788 --> 01:01:53,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Because again,

677
01:01:54,946 --> 01:01:59,828
[SPEAKER_06]: The key words in my resolution are transparency and accountability.

678
01:02:00,469 --> 01:02:15,476
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I want something to be transparent, I'm going to bring it up here in front of all of these people so they all understand the process, not sit in a director's office that they can appease your agenda.

679
01:02:16,116 --> 01:02:17,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's what we're seeing.

680
01:02:18,657 --> 01:02:19,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you said it yourself,

681
01:02:20,768 --> 01:02:23,949
[SPEAKER_06]: You said it yourself, that was a very important meeting for the override.

682
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:30,471
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a very important meeting during the budget to get that approved because there was fear that teachers were gonna be laid off.

683
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:34,272
[SPEAKER_10]: Simply not the truth.

684
01:02:36,832 --> 01:02:44,775
[SPEAKER_06]: So, this is a simple, simple resolution as I said.

685
01:02:45,675 --> 01:02:49,836
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just to send this off to the auditor and get,

686
01:02:50,905 --> 01:03:05,790
[SPEAKER_06]: a true indication of what the financial mismanagement that I see and others see, that we get the answers that are needed and required as we move forward, especially when you're talking about what you were asking for in November, when you talk about overrides.

687
01:03:05,871 --> 01:03:20,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's very important that we get the message out so everybody doesn't make a decision out of anger or lack of knowledge or lack of what was done during the budget season, because that's what it lends to.

688
01:03:21,482 --> 01:03:22,343
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it lends to.

689
01:03:23,944 --> 01:03:26,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Say whatever you want, but that's what it lends to.

690
01:03:27,866 --> 01:03:30,508
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is why this community is so divided.

691
01:03:31,488 --> 01:03:39,033
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't, this is just one council standing up to make sure that the whole community is listened to.

692
01:03:39,534 --> 01:03:43,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the 200 people that showed up for meeting and they were gonna be inconvenienced.

693
01:03:43,776 --> 01:03:45,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Because honestly, I know all of you.

694
01:03:46,218 --> 01:03:48,940
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know you're very bright people and we've talked a lot

695
01:03:50,751 --> 01:04:07,845
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I talked to you privately and I said, realistically, y'all given information about $9 million on a Friday, without talking to anybody, even okay, we talked to the directors, but then we go to move on a vote on a Tuesday.

696
01:04:09,066 --> 01:04:11,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Truly, that is definitely not enough time.

697
01:04:11,768 --> 01:04:12,809
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been doing this long enough.

698
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:17,393
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not enough time to get the answers that this community deserves.

699
01:04:19,195 --> 01:04:19,335
[SPEAKER_06]: So,

700
01:04:22,711 --> 01:04:25,313
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what was said tonight.

701
01:04:25,853 --> 01:04:31,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, this is the process of the council, and the process of the council, you went through with the letter of the law.

702
01:04:32,738 --> 01:04:35,460
[SPEAKER_06]: You motioned it, you voted it, absolutely.

703
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:48,489
[SPEAKER_06]: But I will tell you, say what you want, Council Vance, we worked together, and the council's working together in the room right now, broke a rule that we can use against transparency and open dialogue.

704
01:04:48,709 --> 01:04:49,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Never would have done that to you.

705
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:50,911
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have lost the vote,

706
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:54,764
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have lost the vote, but it was understood.

707
01:04:54,784 --> 01:04:59,167
[SPEAKER_06]: And same here, hey, when I sit and I lose a vote, I take it and move on.

708
01:04:59,767 --> 01:05:02,990
[SPEAKER_06]: But to be stymied, that's not acceptable.

709
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:03,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

710
01:05:04,811 --> 01:05:05,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

711
01:05:05,251 --> 01:05:14,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to relitigate it, and I respect what you just said.

712
01:05:15,302 --> 01:05:19,044
[SPEAKER_14]: There's some stuff that happened in summer 2020 that I felt similarly aggrieved by.

713
01:05:19,064 --> 01:05:21,965
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't write a letter about it.

714
01:05:22,746 --> 01:05:23,726
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Collins.

715
01:05:34,032 --> 01:05:35,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, there's just so much to talk about.

716
01:05:35,513 --> 01:05:37,694
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

717
01:05:41,336 --> 01:05:41,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

718
01:05:44,397 --> 01:05:50,679
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think this is one of those issues where I think we really do agree in what we want.

719
01:05:50,699 --> 01:05:54,720
[SPEAKER_02]: And we see it, we see what's happening differently.

720
01:05:56,260 --> 01:06:06,163
[SPEAKER_02]: What really nettles me is we have so much, it's not like what we say, people in the community believe, because obviously that's not the case.

721
01:06:07,003 --> 01:06:10,884
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we, having one of these microphones is really powerful.

722
01:06:11,145 --> 01:06:12,365
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes with a lot of influence.

723
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:28,929
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think every person behind this rail is in their way, in their different ways, really sensitive to the role that they occupy, the voice that they have, how people hear them, how they're framing the issues, how they're hearing the issues from the committee.

724
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:33,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that every Councilor behind this rail is very sensitive to the type

725
01:06:34,509 --> 01:06:41,731
[SPEAKER_02]: of leader and listener and speaker and representative that they are perceived to be by the community.

726
01:06:41,771 --> 01:06:57,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it is so upsetting to me when behind this rail, we further narratives and binaries that I think are both not true, but actively harmful to our ability to come together and work together.

727
01:06:58,037 --> 01:07:01,738
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, setting up a binary between

728
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:15,333
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about your assumptions and opinions as though they are fact in a city council meeting versus meeting with department heads who are duplicitous to further your own agenda.

729
01:07:16,153 --> 01:07:18,953
[SPEAKER_02]: That binary does not exist.

730
01:07:19,053 --> 01:07:24,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think it is helpful to put that forward as your two options.

731
01:07:24,815 --> 01:07:25,835
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what happens.

732
01:07:27,115 --> 01:07:28,015
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what happens.

733
01:07:29,356 --> 01:07:30,536
[SPEAKER_02]: I also don't think it's helpful

734
01:07:33,584 --> 01:07:48,534
[SPEAKER_02]: to set up a binary between winning a vote and being actively silenced, we've all been on the losing side of the vote.

735
01:07:49,575 --> 01:08:02,884
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether we feel maligned by that or victimized by that, I don't think it's fair to how we talk about these issues to get to pick and choose when we're going to waive that as a flag.

736
01:08:03,772 --> 01:08:10,316
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that I want to minimize the experience of having something that you ardently believe in and getting shot down.

737
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:11,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sucks.

738
01:08:12,057 --> 01:08:16,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been there many times, my first term especially.

739
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:27,467
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it is deeply unhelpful to the community, to this body being able to function at what it's supposed to do for us to broadcast that our two options are

740
01:08:30,387 --> 01:08:36,849
[SPEAKER_02]: be a winning vote for some nefarious agenda or be a stymied, silenced constituency.

741
01:08:37,369 --> 01:08:41,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that, you know, we talk about that's why we're divided.

742
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:44,751
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing more dividing than being told we're divided.

743
01:08:46,091 --> 01:08:56,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish that we came into these conversations not already mad at each other, but willing to say what's happening here and being willing to listen to the answers.

744
01:08:57,454 --> 01:08:59,335
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a conversation with the finance director

745
01:09:00,401 --> 01:09:08,968
[SPEAKER_02]: before the budget about free cash projections, what it's been in the past, what is projected to be, why free cash accumulates the way that it does.

746
01:09:09,448 --> 01:09:21,298
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's fair to residents to keep having this conversation about how our accumulation of free cash, which has now been put into funds where it can be used for purposes throughout the year.

747
01:09:21,318 --> 01:09:28,084
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's fair to the residents to keep talking about this like it was some scheme.

748
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:36,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get why it's fair to the people of this city to keep beating a drum that misinforms people.

749
01:09:41,263 --> 01:09:42,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay if you disagree.

750
01:09:42,584 --> 01:09:44,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wish that we were able to talk about it.

751
01:09:45,146 --> 01:09:45,506
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

752
01:09:47,448 --> 01:09:48,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

753
01:09:48,329 --> 01:09:50,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Collins, Councilor Callahan.

754
01:09:52,018 --> 01:09:55,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I also feel like there are so many responses that I could give.

755
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:58,602
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really not possible to respond to everything.

756
01:09:58,622 --> 01:10:05,305
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I was sad that your motion was Rule 21.

757
01:10:05,345 --> 01:10:06,425
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to vote for it then.

758
01:10:06,445 --> 01:10:09,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I was also going to vote for it the week after when it was pulled.

759
01:10:10,447 --> 01:10:13,168
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to know the answer to these legal questions.

760
01:10:13,368 --> 01:10:25,710
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not feel as sure as Councilor Tseng that I know exactly what that law states, and I would like an official legal opinion, and I look forward to what the Attorney General says.

761
01:10:27,531 --> 01:10:37,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I also wish that, as a general rule, financial matters were brought to us earlier so that we were not under the gun and had to do things.

762
01:10:41,476 --> 01:10:44,718
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is a situation that we are put in.

763
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:59,928
[SPEAKER_03]: And while it is accurate to say that some pink slips went out, some pink slips go out every year, and there would have been dozens and many dozens more pink slips if we had not passed what we passed.

764
01:11:01,229 --> 01:11:05,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's not accurate to say that it made no difference, right?

765
01:11:05,412 --> 01:11:11,176
[SPEAKER_03]: It made a big difference to our schools, whether we voted that week or the next week.

766
01:11:12,577 --> 01:11:17,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like being, would I like another week or two to be able to look at these financial questions?

767
01:11:17,299 --> 01:11:18,200
[SPEAKER_03]: You bet I would.

768
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:29,445
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not the one putting these matters to the city council at the absolute last second so that we are forced to vote on them as fast as possible.

769
01:11:29,465 --> 01:11:30,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that.

770
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:40,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wish that I had some miraculous way to know how the 60,000 people in Medford all think.

771
01:11:41,342 --> 01:11:45,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised to hear anyone say that they know how those 60,000 people all think.

772
01:11:46,726 --> 01:11:54,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I also am really having a lot of trouble understanding how the, like,

773
01:11:56,963 --> 01:12:08,752
[SPEAKER_03]: auditing the way that the overrides were passed because the overrides are a major problem, you know, that our community is not being listened to.

774
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:16,077
[SPEAKER_03]: This whole argument really, I'm really struggling with this because, you know, the overrides was a question of

775
01:12:16,257 --> 01:12:23,087
[SPEAKER_03]: rule 21 and basically us being able to vote on them that week or not.

776
01:12:23,108 --> 01:12:26,593
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there's any argument that rule 21 was

777
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:33,999
[SPEAKER_03]: suspended and that whether that was suspended in a way that was legally like okay or not okay.

778
01:12:34,019 --> 01:12:36,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that simply is unfortunately what it is.

779
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:40,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you don't like the politics of it, but that was voted on properly.

780
01:12:40,762 --> 01:12:42,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And then whether the whole community has listened to it.

781
01:12:42,843 --> 01:12:45,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're literally allowing the voters for the first time.

782
01:12:45,504 --> 01:12:47,264
[SPEAKER_03]: We're allowing the voters to be listened to.

783
01:12:47,745 --> 01:12:50,746
[SPEAKER_03]: We are allowing them to be listened to for the first time in decades.

784
01:12:50,846 --> 01:12:53,287
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really struggling with this argument.

785
01:12:54,924 --> 01:13:07,454
[SPEAKER_03]: or how putting overrides on the ballot so that the community can in fact be listened to by having a democratic vote where everyone can come to the ballot box, how that is not listening to the community.

786
01:13:07,494 --> 01:13:22,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will also say that all the people, I mean, the wildly overwhelming support of people who came to that meeting and spoke in support of putting the overrides on the ballot, and we're yet being told that we aren't listening to the community.

787
01:13:22,445 --> 01:13:24,127
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really struggling.

788
01:13:24,807 --> 01:13:38,999
[SPEAKER_03]: with how that can be when number one, wildly overwhelming support from the community at the meeting where we discussed it, and number two, all we're doing is putting it on the ballot so that we can listen to the community.

789
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:52,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, finally, I wanna say that this particular matter, there is no deadline for whether we vote for an audit.

790
01:13:53,622 --> 01:14:01,310
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am completely, do not understand what the heck we are auditing, because we are gonna audit everything.

791
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:03,352
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna audit financial mismanagement.

792
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:09,498
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna audit the management style of the council president, which I pretty much guarantee you the state auditor is not going to do.

793
01:14:09,518 --> 01:14:14,423
[SPEAKER_03]: The number of things that have been mentioned that we are auditing, I have no idea.

794
01:14:15,103 --> 01:14:25,472
[SPEAKER_03]: what this motion is here to say, and I am not gonna vote on a motion to have the state auditor come in and who knows, spend millions of dollars auditing, I don't know, any random thing.

795
01:14:26,313 --> 01:14:32,698
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a reasonable thing to vote in favor of.

796
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:36,021
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

797
01:14:36,621 --> 01:14:37,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

798
01:14:37,262 --> 01:14:39,524
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish that everyone would respect the councilor's right to speak.

799
01:14:40,979 --> 01:14:43,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion by members of the council?

800
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I just have one comment.

801
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:45,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

802
01:14:46,361 --> 01:15:03,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to expand on what Councilor Callahan mentioned about the process and how everybody was here that night and they were so excited about the override and giving the voice to the people first time voting on it.

803
01:15:04,429 --> 01:15:10,112
[SPEAKER_06]: If you remember the conversation and if you remember the dialogue that was set forth in my motions,

804
01:15:11,598 --> 01:15:22,206
[SPEAKER_06]: was the fact that we had a financial task force that we didn't see or understand how they got to that situation.

805
01:15:22,766 --> 01:15:34,495
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't see how they showed us why we need an override, what got us to that override, and what are we gonna do in the next steps to make sure that we don't need another override the following year.

806
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:35,255
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the questions.

807
01:15:35,696 --> 01:15:39,539
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a transparent process that we were asking for that evening.

808
01:15:40,279 --> 01:15:42,740
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course people came up and voted for it.

809
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:46,541
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course they want to be told that we should go on to vote.

810
01:15:46,801 --> 01:15:47,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

811
01:15:48,342 --> 01:15:51,483
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're not listening to the people that are right in front of you.

812
01:15:52,283 --> 01:15:56,545
[SPEAKER_06]: As many of those people that came up and said, we're for it, thank you so much.

813
01:15:57,605 --> 01:16:00,046
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the same amount of people that are telling you right now.

814
01:16:00,406 --> 01:16:01,606
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not listening to them.

815
01:16:02,047 --> 01:16:02,947
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're not hearing them.

816
01:16:04,619 --> 01:16:16,000
[SPEAKER_06]: So I find it a little disturbing that the process of silencing or discussing or transparency or accountability would have come out in those meetings and discussions

816
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:24,090
[SPEAKER_06]: when we had the opportunity before the votes came out and understood, okay, the financial task force met.

817
01:16:25,034 --> 01:16:48,849
[SPEAKER_06]: no minutes, no understanding how they got to where they did, but we're gonna come out with a $7.5 million override, a $30 million debt exclusion, which by the way, you're gonna be shocked when the firefighters come knocking pretty soon, and the understanding that not just a week later, we find $9 million more in free cash.

818
01:16:51,052 --> 01:17:01,986
[SPEAKER_06]: That alone, if that doesn't open your eyes and say, well, geez, Councilor Scarpelli, eliminate all the negative banter, eliminate one side or the other, geez, that's exactly what happened.

819
01:17:02,627 --> 01:17:06,051
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, maybe we should look at that.

820
01:17:07,032 --> 01:17:10,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though, Councilor Tseng said it, you just said it, people came to that podium.

821
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:12,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course they were in favor of it.

822
01:17:13,234 --> 01:17:17,555
[SPEAKER_06]: But the problem was the people that had questions weren't listened to.

823
01:17:18,435 --> 01:17:20,856
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a lack of transparency and accountability, my friend.

824
01:17:21,176 --> 01:17:22,556
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the problem we have.

825
01:17:23,937 --> 01:17:25,477
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why we're here.

826
01:17:26,237 --> 01:17:31,219
[SPEAKER_06]: So you might be confused in the verbiage that I'm sending the auditor, but let me simplify it.

827
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:35,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm asking the auditor, with our vote,

828
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:41,029
[SPEAKER_06]: to look at our city's finances, period.

829
01:17:42,309 --> 01:17:45,430
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll move forward with the Attorney General after I speak with them tomorrow.

830
01:17:46,591 --> 01:17:47,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they have something to share.

831
01:17:48,731 --> 01:17:58,454
[SPEAKER_06]: But this isn't a very difficult, you can make this a convoluted resolution and be very confusing just because you wanna sign it, but it's a very, to everybody, it's a very simple process.

832
01:17:59,094 --> 01:18:05,596
[SPEAKER_06]: My resolution states that we ask the state auditor by a city council vote and then the mayor's approval

833
01:18:05,976 --> 01:18:26,209
[SPEAKER_06]: to come in and look at the city's finances because I question the process of millions of dollars in free cash and the process of how we got to certain votes when it comes to a financial task force that didn't have minutes to explain to the public what's happened to this community financially, period.

834
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:27,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

835
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:28,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Collins.

836
01:18:34,482 --> 01:18:36,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully this will be the last time I speak on this paper.

837
01:18:36,342 --> 01:18:37,943
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to note two things.

838
01:18:41,544 --> 01:18:45,045
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you that you wish there had been minutes coming out of the financial task force.

839
01:18:46,525 --> 01:18:54,327
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe the next time this is necessary, it'll be formed by committee instead of being a flexible ad hoc group.

840
01:18:55,401 --> 01:19:00,664
[SPEAKER_02]: thing is that any decisions that came out of this task force were put to a vote in a public meeting.

841
01:19:00,724 --> 01:19:18,576
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also think it's really relevant to note, I think it's a very critical distinction that any proposals came out that were discussed in the financial task force, of which I was a member, put forward to the city council, we approved them.

842
01:19:20,477 --> 01:19:22,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Any residents who feel

843
01:19:25,712 --> 01:19:31,993
[SPEAKER_02]: skeptical or uncomfortable or just disapproving of the proposals or of the process.

844
01:19:33,634 --> 01:19:34,134
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?

845
01:19:34,254 --> 01:19:35,614
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to the polls and you vote no.

846
01:19:38,095 --> 01:19:38,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the difference.

847
01:19:39,515 --> 01:19:40,495
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that.

848
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:41,515
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your right.

849
01:19:42,195 --> 01:19:42,796
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your right.

850
01:19:43,716 --> 01:19:49,277
[SPEAKER_02]: From now until the election, residents who happen to be in favor of the proposals

851
01:19:49,813 --> 01:19:51,474
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll be making the case for them.

852
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:54,875
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a lot of answers coming out.

853
01:19:55,115 --> 01:19:58,777
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the process, because this is a thing that everybody gets to vote yes or no on.

854
01:19:59,937 --> 01:20:05,119
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not be making that case from the podium because this is a matter that's going to be voted on, that would be improper.

855
01:20:05,979 --> 01:20:07,900
[SPEAKER_02]: But this information, this case will be made.

856
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:15,403
[SPEAKER_02]: We will have a chance to discuss and debate the answer to those questions by we, I mean the community, in the community.

857
01:20:18,183 --> 01:20:19,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if I can remember the second point I was going to make.

858
01:20:20,004 --> 01:20:27,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have lost it.

859
01:20:27,706 --> 01:20:28,666
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long day.

860
01:20:29,887 --> 01:20:30,707
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll come back to you.

861
01:20:30,887 --> 01:20:31,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

862
01:20:31,707 --> 01:20:33,248
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further comments by members of the council?

863
01:20:33,308 --> 01:20:36,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, one more last comment.

864
01:20:38,849 --> 01:20:46,692
[SPEAKER_06]: And I bring this point up so we can all understand this, that one of my number one motives of moving to free cash

865
01:20:47,591 --> 01:20:55,895
[SPEAKER_06]: and not leaving it up to a vote, is that during subcommittee, a resident asked a very poignant, moving question.

866
01:20:56,856 --> 01:21:00,057
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens if the override fails?

867
01:21:01,118 --> 01:21:04,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Bear stated, it'll be absolutely devastating.

868
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:11,763
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be massive layoffs in our education process, not word for word, Council President, but it'll be a mess.

869
01:21:14,198 --> 01:21:27,961
[SPEAKER_06]: My process was saying, why gamble right now with a total future and not using the free cash that we had in front of us, and then work together as a community to look at other options, but we didn't.

870
01:21:30,062 --> 01:21:32,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Collins, and then I think we should stop the back and forth.

871
01:21:32,522 --> 01:21:32,842
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

872
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:34,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I agree.

873
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:35,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I remember the point I was gonna make.

874
01:21:37,223 --> 01:21:39,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, you're all thrilled.

875
01:21:39,844 --> 01:21:40,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I do just want to,

876
01:21:42,267 --> 01:21:55,555
[SPEAKER_02]: highlight, remind folks that the council did take a vote to have a committee of the whole, maybe sometime in the summer, early in the fall, to meet, to have a public meeting where the administration is present and we discuss the use of funds in our stabilization account.

877
01:21:56,596 --> 01:22:08,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to let that be known, that's a vote that was already taken so that we can have a public discussion about free cash, where it went, how it's going to be used, because I know the administration has had a,

878
01:22:09,170 --> 01:22:23,778
[SPEAKER_02]: ton of capital needs that a lot of that funding is already in demand for these capital projects that were already in the queue, paving, sidewalk repair, city infrastructure, and so on.

879
01:22:24,519 --> 01:22:37,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think it's worth noting that the difference between saying, let's not even propose an override versus putting an override on the ballot and it fails,

880
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:39,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Same outcome.

881
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:49,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, I wanna note, again, I was not in favor of the Rule 21 motion to delay the vote on Councilor Scarpelli's free cash paper.

882
01:22:52,290 --> 01:23:04,739
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that we set up a stabilization fund and a capital stabilization fund and moved some of our 34 million reserves of free cash into the stabilization funds means that we can now use it

883
01:23:06,616 --> 01:23:08,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of that, we could now use that money.

884
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:13,843
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we hadn't done that, that money would be unusable to the city.

885
01:23:13,983 --> 01:23:16,085
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fact, you can shake your head, but that's a fact.

886
01:23:17,086 --> 01:23:19,388
[SPEAKER_02]: While the state is certifying free cash, we cannot touch it.

887
01:23:19,488 --> 01:23:30,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still have not heard a compelling reason why making that surplus, that cash reserves unavailable to the community for the needs that we know we have, I fail to see

888
01:23:31,621 --> 01:23:38,168
[SPEAKER_02]: why that is a better outcome than having it in funds where it is available to be used for the needs that we know we have.

889
01:23:38,288 --> 01:23:39,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sorry, I really will shut up now.

890
01:23:45,746 --> 01:23:48,788
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going to add some informative stuff for folks.

891
01:23:49,629 --> 01:24:03,780
[SPEAKER_14]: If anyone would like to look at them, as Councilor Scarpelli noted, the meetings of June 11th and June 25th are available on YouTube and MedfordTV.org, along with, I think, the seven Committee of the Wholes on the budget that we had prior to those meetings.

892
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:09,604
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of the things that folks are saying as questions, there are answers in those meetings, and I encourage you to watch them.

893
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:12,447
[SPEAKER_14]: There were a lot of answers presented over the

894
01:24:13,107 --> 01:24:17,909
[SPEAKER_14]: most robust budget process that this council has undertaken in decades and the answers are there.

895
01:24:18,810 --> 01:24:26,153
[SPEAKER_14]: There's also answers on the free cash questions and a memorandum attached to the June 25th letter and that were discussed at the June 25th meeting.

896
01:24:26,693 --> 01:24:40,720
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you do have questions or concerns, there's a lot of information out there and we've made it a real point of this council to put as much information about the budget as possible, the situation that we're in, and quite frankly, the reason that

897
01:24:41,500 --> 01:24:49,287
[SPEAKER_14]: If we had appropriated free cash now, the cliff that I talk about happening, if an override doesn't pass, is a cliff that happens next June.

898
01:24:49,867 --> 01:24:54,231
[SPEAKER_14]: It just postpones the problem that has been very clear from all the budget meetings that we have.

899
01:24:54,691 --> 01:24:58,074
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to call the question of, are we going to invest in the city?

900
01:24:58,134 --> 01:24:59,535
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the question that's been called.

901
01:25:00,516 --> 01:25:09,663
[SPEAKER_14]: The free cash reserves, as noted, we are going to have a committee of the whole meeting to discuss the free cash plan outlined in the June 25th memo, or the memo from

902
01:25:10,464 --> 01:25:13,746
[SPEAKER_14]: June 21st, that was on the June 25th agenda.

903
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:20,511
[SPEAKER_14]: And I really encourage people to, as Councilor Scarpelli said, watch those meetings, read the materials attached to those meetings.

904
01:25:20,851 --> 01:25:23,153
[SPEAKER_14]: You will find very helpful and informative answers.

905
01:25:24,554 --> 01:25:27,516
[SPEAKER_14]: With that, are there any members of the public who would like to speak on this resolution?

906
01:25:36,202 --> 01:25:37,143
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record.

907
01:25:37,183 --> 01:25:39,805
[SPEAKER_14]: You have three minutes and we'll alternate between the podium and Zoom.

908
01:25:41,215 --> 01:25:44,977
[SPEAKER_21]: Nick Giorleo, G-I-U-R-L-E-O, 40 Robinson Road.

909
01:25:46,998 --> 01:25:56,904
[SPEAKER_21]: I would just like to use my time tonight to speak in favor of Councilor Scarpelli's resolution and to provide a legal opinion on some of the legal issues that we've been talking about tonight.

910
01:25:57,004 --> 01:26:00,766
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a licensed attorney, so I feel that might be appropriate.

911
01:26:01,026 --> 01:26:05,409
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not speaking on behalf of any organization, just speaking here as a concerned citizen.

912
01:26:06,664 --> 01:26:15,173
[SPEAKER_21]: So I've reviewed the materials here, I've reviewed Councilor Scarpelli's letter, the resolution, the law at issue, the rules at issue.

913
01:26:16,794 --> 01:26:22,240
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli claims that his rights under the statute 43-22 were violated.

914
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,082
[SPEAKER_21]: I have the statute here, I'll read from it.

915
01:26:24,887 --> 01:26:33,690
[SPEAKER_21]: Any ordinance, order, or resolution may be passed through all its stages of legislation at one session, provided that no members of the council objects thereto.

916
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:38,812
[SPEAKER_21]: But if any member of the council objects, the measure shall be postponed for that meeting.

917
01:26:39,994 --> 01:26:46,858
[SPEAKER_21]: Councilor Scarpelli says the statute's applicable, and that he invoked it at that June 25th meeting, and I agree with him.

918
01:26:47,058 --> 01:26:49,359
[SPEAKER_21]: I was actually there at that meeting, and I heard him say that.

919
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,341
[SPEAKER_21]: I heard him invoke his right under that statute.

920
01:26:53,062 --> 01:27:06,309
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, five financial papers were presented at that evening and passed through all stages of their legislation, as the statute says, at one session over Councilor Scarpelli's clear objection, an invocation of 4322.

921
01:27:08,186 --> 01:27:14,813
[SPEAKER_21]: Therefore, a vote on those papers per the plain language of the statute here should have been postponed for the next meeting.

922
01:27:15,354 --> 01:27:19,038
[SPEAKER_21]: My interpretation of that statute does differ from Councilor Tseng's interpretation.

923
01:27:21,095 --> 01:27:24,818
[SPEAKER_21]: I think suspension of the rules through 32 was improper.

924
01:27:25,659 --> 01:27:31,524
[SPEAKER_21]: State statutes do supersede all local rules of this council and any council in Massachusetts.

925
01:27:32,144 --> 01:27:34,606
[SPEAKER_21]: And the council's own rules recognize this.

926
01:27:35,347 --> 01:27:45,456
[SPEAKER_21]: If we actually look at the text of rule 32, the suspension rule, it states that suspension is only allowed, I'm quoting, insofar as these rules are not of statutory sources or origin.

927
01:27:46,462 --> 01:27:56,251
[SPEAKER_21]: Rule 21 states that any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any member.

928
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:59,795
[SPEAKER_21]: That's clearly of statutory origin, in my legal opinion here.

929
01:27:59,855 --> 01:28:04,699
[SPEAKER_21]: By its plain language, you're basically codifying through that rule that we have in the council here, 4322.

930
01:28:07,642 --> 01:28:14,805
[SPEAKER_21]: So in summary here, not only do I think the council violated 4322, I think it violated its own internal rules here.

931
01:28:16,045 --> 01:28:21,428
[SPEAKER_21]: And more politically speaking, I would say our city really should be promoting financial transparency.

932
01:28:21,488 --> 01:28:24,469
[SPEAKER_21]: So I really do believe a vote in favor here.

933
01:28:26,778 --> 01:28:27,599
[SPEAKER_21]: about 30 seconds.

934
01:28:27,699 --> 01:28:31,342
[SPEAKER_21]: I really do believe a vote in favor of here would do just that.

935
01:28:31,923 --> 01:28:32,724
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'll support it.

936
01:28:33,424 --> 01:28:40,791
[SPEAKER_21]: And also just stay for the record, my legal opinion here that, uh, I do believe Councilor Scarpelli has legally meritorious claims.

937
01:28:41,011 --> 01:28:41,331
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

938
01:28:47,837 --> 01:28:48,157
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

939
01:28:48,197 --> 01:28:50,219
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll go to Donna on zoom.

940
01:28:50,259 --> 01:28:51,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Donna, they have an address for the record, please.

941
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Donna, are you there?

942
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:07,890
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, then we will go to Eileen on Zoom.

943
01:29:08,210 --> 01:29:09,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

944
01:29:09,451 --> 01:29:10,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Eileen, you have three minutes.

945
01:29:18,533 --> 01:29:23,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Eileen?

946
01:29:28,752 --> 01:29:30,133
[SPEAKER_10]: Eileen, I'm requesting to unmute you.

947
01:29:30,153 --> 01:29:38,841
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, is there anyone in the chamber or on Zoom who would like to comment on this paper?

948
01:29:38,861 --> 01:29:44,706
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

949
01:29:44,726 --> 01:29:45,446
[SPEAKER_13]: You have three minutes.

950
01:29:47,148 --> 01:29:48,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take less than that.

951
01:29:48,569 --> 01:29:50,311
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Doreen O'Hare, Malden Street.

952
01:29:51,852 --> 01:29:55,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also in favor of the audit, and I don't understand

953
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,705
[SPEAKER_01]: why we would not want to be transparent, knowing that this has happened.

954
01:30:02,645 --> 01:30:15,173
[SPEAKER_01]: a few years in a row where we have extra cash that wasn't used, however you call it, free cash, whatever it's called, there's a lot of money sitting on the table that we need to know where this money's coming from.

955
01:30:15,273 --> 01:30:24,479
[SPEAKER_01]: And before you put something on a ballot, I'll tell you right now, I'm voting no because you're not managing my money the way it should be if you have all this extra cash.

956
01:30:24,619 --> 01:30:26,741
[SPEAKER_01]: No one in their right mind is gonna feel comfortable

957
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:34,242
[SPEAKER_01]: giving you more money to possibly mismanage, and nobody's saying that it is being mismanaged.

958
01:30:34,282 --> 01:30:38,963
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of why not be fully transparent and know where everything is?

959
01:30:39,763 --> 01:30:41,764
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand why this is even a question.

960
01:30:41,824 --> 01:30:45,165
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like such a no-brainer from the community standpoint.

961
01:30:48,866 --> 01:30:49,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

962
01:30:49,586 --> 01:30:50,867
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to go to Zoom.

963
01:30:50,927 --> 01:30:51,967
[SPEAKER_13]: Jessica, can you hear me on Zoom?

964
01:30:52,047 --> 01:30:54,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to ask for the record, please.

965
01:30:54,368 --> 01:30:55,288
[SPEAKER_13]: You have three minutes.

966
01:30:57,335 --> 01:31:22,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, um, jessica healy full lock road i'm just wondering why there's really even a Issue with having an outside auditor come in from the state I supported a hundred percent And we did just hear from a lawyer who also agrees so i'm not sure why this Has been such a big deal and all this arguing over just having someone come in

967
01:31:23,126 --> 01:31:30,092
[SPEAKER_00]: that use our tax money and pay them to do an audit to be very transparent and put everything to rest.

968
01:31:30,592 --> 01:31:32,874
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everyone would just like that.

969
01:31:33,495 --> 01:31:33,875
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

970
01:31:34,936 --> 01:31:35,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

971
01:31:37,939 --> 01:31:41,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone else in the room who would like to speak, please come to the podium, name and address for the record.

972
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:42,202
[SPEAKER_14]: You have three minutes.

973
01:31:45,565 --> 01:31:48,408
[SPEAKER_19]: Jennifer Yanko, 16 Monument Street.

974
01:31:50,152 --> 01:31:56,237
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm a bit concerned because the city is audited annually, is that not so?

975
01:31:56,557 --> 01:31:56,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

976
01:31:57,377 --> 01:32:03,482
[SPEAKER_19]: And I have some familiarity with audits and audits are done by independent auditors.

977
01:32:03,543 --> 01:32:06,845
[SPEAKER_19]: There are very strict regulations on how audits are conducted.

978
01:32:07,286 --> 01:32:13,671
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we have an annual audit, why not use the information that we have from those audits?

979
01:32:14,552 --> 01:32:18,115
[SPEAKER_19]: And if we want transparency, look at those audits rather than

980
01:32:19,383 --> 01:32:22,767
[SPEAKER_19]: paying out funds that we're already strapped for money.

981
01:32:22,807 --> 01:32:26,072
[SPEAKER_19]: So why would we pay out money to have another independent audit?

982
01:32:27,293 --> 01:32:30,477
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we do have an annual audit.

983
01:32:30,918 --> 01:32:33,060
[SPEAKER_19]: That's why we have an audit, for transparency.

984
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:33,982
[SPEAKER_19]: So let's use it.

985
01:32:34,442 --> 01:32:37,166
[SPEAKER_19]: There's no need for another audit, in my opinion.

986
01:32:39,266 --> 01:32:40,587
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's all I have to say.

987
01:32:40,607 --> 01:32:40,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

988
01:32:40,947 --> 01:32:49,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, state law requires all municipalities to have an annual audit, and it is an independent audit done by someone outside the city, and it is published when completed on the city website.

989
01:32:52,836 --> 01:32:54,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further comment by members of the public?

990
01:32:56,018 --> 01:32:57,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna go to try Donna on Zoom again.

991
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Donna, I'm gonna try you again.

992
01:32:59,801 --> 01:33:01,443
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm asking you to unmute.

993
01:33:02,003 --> 01:33:04,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, can you hear me?

994
01:33:05,345 --> 01:33:06,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, can you hear me?

995
01:33:07,067 --> 01:33:07,367
[SPEAKER_14]: Please.

996
01:33:08,087 --> 01:33:08,628
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me?

997
01:33:09,602 --> 01:33:10,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, please provide your name and address.

998
01:33:11,483 --> 01:33:15,926
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Donna Silva, 1536 Mystic Valley Parkway.

999
01:33:17,947 --> 01:33:19,628
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to say I'm for the audit.

1000
01:33:20,969 --> 01:33:24,791
[SPEAKER_17]: Reason being, financial matters need to be addressed.

1001
01:33:27,853 --> 01:33:34,276
[SPEAKER_17]: All we heard tonight is the word narrative, at least 20 times, and everyone believes their own narrative.

1002
01:33:35,017 --> 01:33:36,337
[SPEAKER_17]: But let's discuss facts.

1003
01:33:38,971 --> 01:33:48,157
[SPEAKER_17]: The facts are, the city solicitor, here's just one example, is the city solicitor job description that pays 138 to 160K.

1004
01:33:48,237 --> 01:33:51,099
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, that's 1,000, okay?

1005
01:33:52,681 --> 01:33:57,924
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, we understand that there are gonna be times that we're gonna have to outsource legal counsel.

1006
01:33:58,645 --> 01:33:59,305
[SPEAKER_17]: Understandable.

1007
01:34:00,786 --> 01:34:05,489
[SPEAKER_17]: But why did we spend in excess of 800,000 in legal fees?

1008
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:07,371
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what the audit showed.

1009
01:34:09,512 --> 01:34:11,653
[SPEAKER_17]: I think some of these invoices have to be looked at.

1010
01:34:14,114 --> 01:34:22,097
[SPEAKER_17]: That's a lot of money for a city to spend in legal fees without having a city solicitor.

1011
01:34:22,177 --> 01:34:33,722
[SPEAKER_17]: I can see if we were being sued and the city solicitor couldn't handle it, but we don't have a city solicitor and we're only offering 138 to 160.

1012
01:34:34,382 --> 01:34:35,762
[SPEAKER_17]: Why don't we increase it a little bit?

1013
01:34:36,002 --> 01:34:37,163
[SPEAKER_17]: We might get a good attorney.

1014
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:52,304
[SPEAKER_17]: But 800,000, does the city council, do they feel that not having a city solicitor and spending, and this is one small example, okay?

1015
01:34:52,524 --> 01:34:53,744
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's a big example because it's $800,000.

1016
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:57,237
[SPEAKER_17]: That's my question.

1017
01:34:57,317 --> 01:35:07,204
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's why I would like to see an audit to explain where these funds are going and why we're spending the money where we're spending it.

1018
01:35:07,664 --> 01:35:15,390
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the council should be asking the mayor why we're spending these funds and why we don't have a city solicitor.

1019
01:35:15,410 --> 01:35:19,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1020
01:35:24,329 --> 01:35:25,872
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record please, you have three minutes.

1021
01:35:26,653 --> 01:35:29,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Lori Spinney-Flagg, 55 Garfield Avenue.

1022
01:35:30,059 --> 01:35:34,387
[SPEAKER_12]: I also would like to know the answer to that, why we no longer have a city solicitor.

1023
01:35:37,122 --> 01:35:48,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I sent you all an email prior to the methadone dispensary thing a few weeks ago, which is surrounding all these meetings that you're speaking of, in which he was silenced.

1024
01:35:49,647 --> 01:35:59,812
[SPEAKER_12]: All he asked was to table it, to look at the free cash before we went straight on for an override, two overrides.

1025
01:36:00,712 --> 01:36:07,826
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have to say, I live off of Route 60, and they just opened our fire station this week.

1026
01:36:08,588 --> 01:36:11,133
[SPEAKER_12]: And it doesn't look like they did a whole lot to it.

1027
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:22,388
[SPEAKER_12]: But it costs $600,000, and that was part of this override you were looking for, for new fire stations and all that, schools.

1028
01:36:22,428 --> 01:36:23,989
[SPEAKER_14]: That station's not a part of that.

1029
01:36:24,249 --> 01:36:37,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I do question the management of this city, as I mentioned to all of you, Council, that I emailed, about living in this city all of my life and watching the mismanagement that's gone on.

1030
01:36:37,639 --> 01:36:37,919
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean,

1031
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:41,848
[SPEAKER_12]: perfect example is your meters.

1032
01:36:42,468 --> 01:36:52,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Those meters were there all of my life and they were taken out 10, 12 years ago and put kiosks that you had to walk down the street to register your car to park.

1033
01:36:53,417 --> 01:36:55,939
[SPEAKER_12]: And now all the meters are back.

1034
01:36:56,699 --> 01:36:59,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that a waste of our taxpayer money?

1035
01:36:59,521 --> 01:37:02,504
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think privatizing the parking was a good idea 10 years ago.

1036
01:37:02,544 --> 01:37:02,764
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree.

1037
01:37:03,702 --> 01:37:16,537
[SPEAKER_12]: But these are the things that keep happening in this city, that we waste this money over and over and over again on things that is not exactly what the residents or the community are looking for.

1038
01:37:21,451 --> 01:37:29,634
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that- I think that the council needs to listen to the residents and the taxpayers a whole lot more than they have.

1039
01:37:30,215 --> 01:37:41,780
[SPEAKER_12]: And you know, you might be beating on poor Mr. Scarpelli here, but maybe it's because he's actually listening to the residents in the community.

1040
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:42,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1041
01:37:42,300 --> 01:37:47,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Councilor Scarpelli, anyone's beating on Councilor Scarpelli, nor do I think he would allow it.

1042
01:37:48,524 --> 01:38:01,153
[SPEAKER_14]: But I will say that I think everyone behind this rail believes that we are doing our best diligently to dig out of a very significant hole, and that has been put in place over many decades, and that we are working to address that.

1043
01:38:01,453 --> 01:38:04,455
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what the proposals and the discussions we've had.

1044
01:38:04,475 --> 01:38:08,618
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what the updated budget process that we've been put in place is about.

1045
01:38:08,999 --> 01:38:12,781
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what the assessments of capital needs are about, and that is why we are

1046
01:38:14,122 --> 01:38:18,587
[SPEAKER_14]: putting more information out than ever before through a much longer process about the budget than has ever happened.

1047
01:38:18,687 --> 01:38:20,909
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was a priority of me since day one.

1048
01:38:21,390 --> 01:38:24,373
[SPEAKER_14]: We've made a lot of progress and we're going to continue doing the work.

1049
01:38:24,874 --> 01:38:27,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Council President, if I can, just to clarify.

1050
01:38:32,902 --> 01:38:33,303
[SPEAKER_09]: If I can.

1051
01:38:34,869 --> 01:38:35,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1052
01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:40,071
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that we've talked about the audit that's done every year.

1053
01:38:40,672 --> 01:38:51,896
[SPEAKER_06]: The process that, the piece that we really would benefit from, from the state audit, isn't just, the audit that we get every year is the figure, the money line.

1054
01:38:52,717 --> 01:38:55,378
[SPEAKER_06]: And it comes out, like I said, I don't question

1055
01:38:56,670 --> 01:39:00,391
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it's being used fraudulently in the sense that it's illegal.

1056
01:39:01,091 --> 01:39:07,013
[SPEAKER_06]: My questions I have, and something that the state auditor's office will do, is audit the process.

1057
01:39:07,973 --> 01:39:10,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only the figure, but the process.

1058
01:39:10,454 --> 01:39:13,455
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're seeing with being the biggest issue right now.

1059
01:39:13,995 --> 01:39:17,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the audit comes in and they say, yep, all the numbers add up when you add up the numbers.

1060
01:39:18,336 --> 01:39:22,578
[SPEAKER_06]: But when the year is over, when the year is over and the mayor presents $9 million,

1061
01:39:24,684 --> 01:39:26,125
[SPEAKER_06]: The process has to be investigated.

1062
01:39:26,405 --> 01:39:26,945
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

1063
01:39:26,965 --> 01:39:28,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1064
01:39:28,465 --> 01:39:30,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further comment by members of the public?

1065
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:33,047
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to go to people who haven't spoken first, and then I will come back to you.

1066
01:39:34,168 --> 01:39:35,928
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see any hands on Zoom, so go to the podium.

1067
01:39:35,948 --> 01:39:37,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

1068
01:39:37,349 --> 01:39:39,950
[SPEAKER_22]: Deanne Inversano, 23 Emerald Street.

1069
01:39:42,951 --> 01:39:47,793
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm trying to understand this, and you say there was 9 million.

1070
01:39:48,493 --> 01:39:54,015
[SPEAKER_22]: So how did you not know there was 9 million in a checkbook sitting somewhere?

1071
01:39:55,655 --> 01:39:59,118
[SPEAKER_22]: So that lends to be an audit issue.

1072
01:39:59,418 --> 01:40:03,161
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not accurate to say that we did not know that there was money there.

1073
01:40:03,401 --> 01:40:03,941
[SPEAKER_14]: We did not know.

1074
01:40:03,961 --> 01:40:05,703
[SPEAKER_22]: So what didn't you?

1075
01:40:06,383 --> 01:40:07,644
[SPEAKER_22]: So how did it appear?

1076
01:40:07,764 --> 01:40:11,067
[SPEAKER_14]: The state, the Division of Local Services, part of the Department of Revenue.

1077
01:40:11,087 --> 01:40:12,108
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they give money every year.

1078
01:40:12,128 --> 01:40:16,311
[SPEAKER_14]: No, they actually certify the city's free cash reserve balance every year.

1079
01:40:16,471 --> 01:40:16,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1080
01:40:16,891 --> 01:40:19,353
[SPEAKER_14]: And they certified that balance in June this year.

1081
01:40:19,974 --> 01:40:22,376
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is when we got the official certification.

1082
01:40:22,396 --> 01:40:23,997
[SPEAKER_22]: On what date did they certify?

1083
01:40:24,017 --> 01:40:25,398
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have to look, but it was probably

1084
01:40:25,418 --> 01:40:26,719
[SPEAKER_14]: probably between June 15th and 20th.

1085
01:40:26,759 --> 01:40:29,920
[SPEAKER_22]: That was before you passed the budget.

1086
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:31,221
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it was after the budget.

1087
01:40:31,241 --> 01:40:35,663
[SPEAKER_06]: This council might've known, but the financial team, they definitely knew there was $9 million.

1088
01:40:35,703 --> 01:40:45,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, and the financial team communicated to this council at budget meetings and committee of the whole, that there was going to be a free cash balance this year.

1089
01:40:45,988 --> 01:40:48,829
[SPEAKER_14]: similar to the previous few years for three major reasons.

1090
01:40:49,329 --> 01:40:55,830
[SPEAKER_14]: The use of federal funds, ARPA funding from the federal government, one-time funds, in the place where free cash reserves may have otherwise been used.

1091
01:40:56,130 --> 01:41:00,091
[SPEAKER_22]: I went to local services and I looked on their website and I saw what METCIT gets.

1092
01:41:00,911 --> 01:41:02,271
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1093
01:41:02,291 --> 01:41:02,672
[SPEAKER_22]: $34 million.

1094
01:41:03,212 --> 01:41:04,332
[SPEAKER_14]: That was a certification, yes.

1095
01:41:04,352 --> 01:41:04,492
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

1096
01:41:04,992 --> 01:41:06,872
[SPEAKER_22]: So you know that money's coming in.

1097
01:41:07,693 --> 01:41:08,793
[SPEAKER_22]: It comes in every year.

1098
01:41:10,188 --> 01:41:12,453
[SPEAKER_22]: You can see the list.

1099
01:41:12,914 --> 01:41:16,763
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a one-time surplus and is not reliably budgetable.

1100
01:41:16,783 --> 01:41:20,191
[SPEAKER_22]: But you know something's coming in.

1101
01:41:22,355 --> 01:41:24,336
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know how much is coming until it's certified.

1102
01:41:24,376 --> 01:41:34,783
[SPEAKER_14]: And the financial experts on our finance team have said that we should not expect to have free cash balances of $9 million going forward.

1103
01:41:35,224 --> 01:41:48,092
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be much more that what they have said in multiple meetings that we've had in this chamber is that we should expect, similar to what was under Mayor McGlynn and Mayor Burke, between $500,000 and $2 million free cash balance surpluses certified at the end of the year.

1104
01:41:51,175 --> 01:41:52,716
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to know what's in the checkbook.

1105
01:41:53,196 --> 01:41:55,037
[SPEAKER_22]: So we need to know what's in the checkbook.

1106
01:41:55,057 --> 01:41:57,179
[SPEAKER_22]: The residents need to know what's in the checkbook.

1107
01:41:57,899 --> 01:42:02,622
[SPEAKER_22]: And with that budget that the mayor presented, here's an org chart.

1108
01:42:03,603 --> 01:42:11,888
[SPEAKER_22]: And the org chart is Medford residents on top with city council and the mayor below them.

1109
01:42:12,968 --> 01:42:18,532
[SPEAKER_22]: So the Medford residents, and I'm one of them, would like an audit.

1110
01:42:19,132 --> 01:42:19,452
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1111
01:42:23,814 --> 01:42:25,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we further comment by members of the public?

1112
01:42:29,317 --> 01:42:31,258
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see any hands on Zoom, so we'll take you at the podium.

1113
01:42:31,278 --> 01:42:34,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, you have three minutes.

1114
01:42:34,299 --> 01:42:40,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Paulette Vartabedian, 27 Central Ave, Medford, and I'm not gonna talk about my grandmother shoveling.

1115
01:42:40,662 --> 01:42:48,286
[SPEAKER_16]: But I just wanna say that just because of the, it appears the number of people that are questioning this

1116
01:42:51,832 --> 01:43:01,559
[SPEAKER_16]: If for no other reason than to say everything is great, everything is in perfect order, I fully support an outside audit.

1117
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:08,003
[SPEAKER_16]: If for no other reason that, like I just said, that you say everything is done right.

1118
01:43:09,244 --> 01:43:13,067
[SPEAKER_16]: There's too much question by the public, whether it's our ignorance.

1119
01:43:13,968 --> 01:43:21,553
[SPEAKER_16]: I will say that, yes, I am ignorant of all this, but I want to become knowledgeable

1120
01:43:22,253 --> 01:43:29,217
[SPEAKER_16]: And to see that an outside agency with no sides, it will say, yes, this is correct.

1121
01:43:30,357 --> 01:43:32,038
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's money well spent.

1122
01:43:32,818 --> 01:43:39,062
[SPEAKER_16]: And just, if I may, on a totally separate topic, please take care of our firefighters and our policemen.

1123
01:43:39,562 --> 01:43:40,282
[SPEAKER_16]: We need them.

1124
01:43:40,622 --> 01:43:41,343
[SPEAKER_16]: We need them.

1125
01:43:43,291 --> 01:43:49,004
[SPEAKER_16]: And don't equate the city of Medford with our surrounding cities such as Somerville and Cambridge.

1126
01:43:49,285 --> 01:43:49,846
[SPEAKER_16]: We are not.

1127
01:43:50,327 --> 01:43:51,069
[SPEAKER_16]: We are Medford.

1128
01:43:51,249 --> 01:43:51,891
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you all.

1129
01:43:51,951 --> 01:43:52,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1130
01:43:52,853 --> 01:43:53,234
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1131
01:43:56,860 --> 01:43:59,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone else who'd like to speak, either in person or on Zoom?

1132
01:43:59,783 --> 01:44:01,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing no hands on Zoom, I will go to the podium.

1133
01:44:01,766 --> 01:44:02,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

1134
01:44:02,927 --> 01:44:03,888
[SPEAKER_14]: You have three minutes.

1135
01:44:04,489 --> 01:44:06,011
[SPEAKER_20]: Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street.

1136
01:44:06,111 --> 01:44:15,742
[SPEAKER_20]: So at the last meeting, talking, first of all, I'm in favor of the audit, but at the last meeting, while we're talking about finance and transparency, at the last meeting,

1137
01:44:16,414 --> 01:44:23,037
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it was around 12 o'clock, you guys had voted to give all non-union employee raises, is that correct?

1138
01:44:23,998 --> 01:44:29,820
[SPEAKER_14]: The mayor's paper to give all non-union employees a raise was passed for first reading.

1139
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:31,201
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, for the first reading.

1140
01:44:31,341 --> 01:44:33,822
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you guys fall under that category, the city council?

1141
01:44:34,042 --> 01:44:36,223
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe all non-union employees fall under it.

1142
01:44:36,423 --> 01:44:37,164
[SPEAKER_14]: So that would be you?

1143
01:44:37,564 --> 01:44:38,324
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe so.

1144
01:44:38,444 --> 01:44:42,866
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so you're voting for, you're essentially, I just want the people to know, so you're voting for your own raise.

1145
01:44:44,922 --> 01:44:46,564
[SPEAKER_20]: you're probably gonna pass it.

1146
01:44:46,584 --> 01:44:47,645
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it's the first reading.

1147
01:44:49,306 --> 01:44:50,487
[SPEAKER_20]: The mayor excluded herself.

1148
01:44:50,808 --> 01:44:51,749
[SPEAKER_20]: She did not exclude herself.

1149
01:44:52,429 --> 01:44:52,749
[SPEAKER_20]: She didn't?

1150
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:53,410
[SPEAKER_14]: She did not.

1151
01:45:00,076 --> 01:45:07,223
[SPEAKER_14]: No, she recommended an alternative payment schedule that actually would have resulted in increased compensation, including retroactive pay.

1152
01:45:10,017 --> 01:45:14,499
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you could read the paper, it was a suggestion, and that suggestion was not accepted.

1153
01:45:15,539 --> 01:45:18,700
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know one person that didn't take it as if she was excluding herself.

1154
01:45:18,860 --> 01:45:21,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the text of the paper explicitly says she was not.

1155
01:45:21,781 --> 01:45:30,104
[SPEAKER_20]: OK, so will you guys be excluding yourself from getting a raise and then asking the city for an override?

1156
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:32,145
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't speak to what the council is going to do.

1157
01:45:32,185 --> 01:45:32,925
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just one member.

1158
01:45:38,046 --> 01:45:38,346
[SPEAKER_14]: will you?

1159
01:45:38,366 --> 01:45:39,427
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm asking you.

1160
01:45:39,807 --> 01:45:40,648
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't make motions.

1161
01:45:41,789 --> 01:45:42,670
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't make motions.

1162
01:45:43,991 --> 01:45:44,211
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1163
01:45:44,772 --> 01:45:49,155
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, just let me just let everybody know that they're getting a raise and then they're asking us for an override.

1164
01:45:49,195 --> 01:45:51,057
[SPEAKER_20]: So, and then they're voting yes for their own race.

1165
01:45:51,077 --> 01:45:51,897
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's it.

1166
01:45:54,780 --> 01:45:55,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1167
01:45:56,261 --> 01:45:58,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further comments by members of the public?

1168
01:46:00,224 --> 01:46:04,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, on the motion of councilor Scarpelliglia, seconded by councilor Collins to approve paper 24441,

1169
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:08,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Callahan.

1170
01:46:09,801 --> 01:46:11,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it possible to move to table?

1171
01:46:12,384 --> 01:46:13,605
[SPEAKER_14]: It is possible to move to table.

1172
01:46:13,805 --> 01:46:17,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to move to table because I, here's my reason.

1173
01:46:17,848 --> 01:46:27,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not confident that the money that we would spend right now would be any different from the yearly audit that we already have done by an independent team.

1174
01:46:28,258 --> 01:46:32,461
[SPEAKER_03]: So until I understand that it would be different,

1175
01:46:33,630 --> 01:46:41,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot vote in favor of this because it would literally just be duplicating work that is already done.

1176
01:46:41,858 --> 01:46:43,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to table is undebatable.

1177
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:45,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a second on the motion to table?

1178
01:46:51,046 --> 01:46:52,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a second on the motion to table?

1179
01:46:54,758 --> 01:46:56,759
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing no second, the motion to table is not accepted.

1180
01:46:56,799 --> 01:47:03,241
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Vice President Collins, paper 24441.

1181
01:47:03,901 --> 01:47:04,841

[SPEAKER_14]: I just unmuted him.

1191
01:47:34,832 --> 01:47:35,512
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng.

1192
01:47:40,114 --> 01:47:40,294

[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve.
