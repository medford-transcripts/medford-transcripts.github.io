Hello and welcome to the first ever season of Bedford Bites.

00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:13,677
My name is Danielle, and along with being a mom and a social worker, I'm a resident of Medford and your host for this podcast.

00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:22,205
My intention behind this podcast is to provide information bites about current events in Medford, as well as discussion of where to get the best bites to eat in town.

00:00:23,146 --> 00:00:26,629
This podcast is beginning only weeks away from the city's municipal election.

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,812
Residents are voting on November 2nd for Mayor, City Council, and School Committee.

00:00:32,452 --> 00:00:39,075
On future episodes, you may hear more from me about other topics, but for now, I'm going to let the candidates do a majority of the talking.

00:00:40,253 --> 00:00:45,498
After this episode, you will see several interviews in your feed of some of the candidates that are running in the upcoming election.
