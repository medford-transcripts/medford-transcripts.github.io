Hello and welcome to the first ever season of Bedford Bites. My name is Danielle, and along with being a mom and a social worker, I'm a resident of Medford and your host for this podcast. My intention behind this podcast is to provide information bites about current events in Medford, as well as discussion of where to get the best bites to eat in town. This podcast is beginning only weeks away from the city's municipal election.

Residents are voting on November 2nd for Mayor, City Council, and School Committee. On future episodes, you may hear more from me about other topics, but for now, I'm going to let the candidates do a majority of the talking.
