1
00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:03,444
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'll call the meeting to order at 7.05.

2
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:09,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a quick housekeeping item as I read the governor's statement.

3
00:00:10,287 --> 00:00:10,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

4
00:00:10,887 --> 00:00:20,232
[SPEAKER_08]: On March 28th, 2025, Governor Healey signed into law a bill which extends the temporary provision pertaining to the open meeting lot of June 30th, 2027.

5
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:26,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically, this further extension allows public bodies to continue holding meetings remotely.

6
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:35,460
[SPEAKER_08]: without a quorum of the public body being physically present in a meeting room location and to provide adequate alternative access to remote meetings.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,723
[SPEAKER_08]: The language does not make any substantive changes to the open meeting law other than extending the date.

8
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:43,905
[SPEAKER_08]: All right with that all set

9
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:46,943
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll hop over to our agenda.

10
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:48,865
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a pretty packed agenda.

11
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:50,546
[SPEAKER_08]: We have two public hearings to start.

12
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:53,209
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start with 47 Holton Street.

13
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:55,051
[SPEAKER_08]: I have it as Holt Street on the agenda.

14
00:00:55,111 --> 00:00:55,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Apologies.

15
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:58,895
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 47 Holton Street.

16
00:01:00,156 --> 00:01:04,240
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is for the benefit of both 47 Holton Street and 16 Manning Street.

17
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:14,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Later down the line, 26 Alfred Street, the historical commission has a demolition delay ordinance, which we administer.

18
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,491
[SPEAKER_08]: It's two parts.

19
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:20,595
[SPEAKER_08]: We receive the application and then determine whether or not the building is significant.

20
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:26,681
[SPEAKER_08]: And then for those buildings which are determined significant, we have a public hearing.

21
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:29,303
[SPEAKER_08]: So in terms of significant,

22
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:38,746
[SPEAKER_08]: What that means is that the Commission has determined it is either listed or pending listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

23
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:54,933
[SPEAKER_08]: It is or is pending listing on the Massachusetts Register of Historic Places or more commonly in Medford, was built within 75 years or older, which is determined by the Commission to be significant either because it is importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events,

24
00:01:55,553 --> 00:02:09,988
[SPEAKER_08]: or with the broad architectural cultural political economic or social history of the city or the commonwealth or it is historically or architecturally important in terms of period style method of building construction or association with an important architectural builder either by itself

25
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,071
[SPEAKER_08]: or in the context of a group of buildings.

26
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:35,127
[SPEAKER_08]: So the commission has determined that 47 Holton Street is significant so we are having a public hearing on whether it is preferably preserved and preferably preserved meaning the commission determines as provided by subsection 48-78 that is in the public interest to be preserved and rehabilitated rather than demolished.

27
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:41,273
[SPEAKER_08]: So tonight we are going to start with historical commission motions.

28
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:44,536
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to hear from the commissioners and I'll open it up to public comments.

29
00:02:45,557 --> 00:02:51,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Those in favor of demolition, those against, and then from there we'll close public comments.

30
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:58,530
[SPEAKER_08]: The commissioners will take final final comments and then we'll have final motions and we will move forward with the vote.

31
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:08,255
[SPEAKER_08]: So commissioners, I will entertain a motion, please, if you will, on the status of Preferably Preserved for 47 Holton Street.

32
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:17,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I will make a motion to find the property of 47 Holton Street Preferably Preserved.

33
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:18,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

34
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,120
[SPEAKER_08]: And a second?

35
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:20,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

36
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:22,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Peter.

37
00:03:24,627 --> 00:03:28,008
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think the Form B lays out the case pretty strongly.

38
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:32,229
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a building that's just around the corner from my house.

39
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:36,709
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really great neighborhood full of a lot of these late 19th century.

40
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:37,790
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a unique house.

41
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,870
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not a design I actually have seen in Medford.

42
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,831
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's a lot in the Form B to basically hold on to this building.

43
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a good building.

44
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:48,732
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs work, obviously.

45
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:49,912
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not in perfect shape.

46
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:53,973
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has obviously, like many houses in Medford, not been

47
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:59,096
[SPEAKER_05]: perfectly restored or changed over the years.

48
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:06,681
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's enough there, original fabric, and I think it's a nice Queen Anne that deserves to remain in the fabric of the Westminster neighborhood.

49
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

50
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:09,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter?

51
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:12,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Agreed.

52
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:15,747
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Doug hit on the high points for me too.

53
00:04:18,332 --> 00:04:19,613
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a beautiful home.

54
00:04:20,854 --> 00:04:27,139
[SPEAKER_07]: It's got a lot of nice form to it and existing detail.

55
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I suppose it would need to be recited because of the asbestos, but nice chimneys.

56
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:42,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I thought the historical narrative was pretty compelling.

57
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:49,290
[SPEAKER_07]: With Lewis Lovering, it's the builder in association with the Lovering family.

58
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So for me, this is a pretty easy choice.

59
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:55,112
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it should be preferably preserved.

60
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:56,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

61
00:04:58,253 --> 00:04:58,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

62
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:05,755
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I agree with everything that

63
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:19,972
[SPEAKER_10]: Doug and Peter have said, I would also add that at the end of the form B, the commentary about eligible for a national register listing as part of a historic district.

64
00:05:19,992 --> 00:05:28,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's no better way to ensure that we'll have no historic districts if we completely tear down pre-1900 buildings.

65
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:40,815
[SPEAKER_08]: And then just for myself, because I do count towards the quorum here tonight, because we don't have Jen this evening yet.

66
00:05:42,536 --> 00:05:50,922
[SPEAKER_08]: I am sort of fascinated by the history of this building, in addition to it being a Louis Lovering architect designed and built house.

67
00:05:52,043 --> 00:06:00,389
[SPEAKER_08]: It is an example of a type of house built in this diverse,

68
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,504
[SPEAKER_08]: neighborhood.

69
00:06:02,524 --> 00:06:08,489
[SPEAKER_08]: This was one of Medford's first truly integrated neighborhoods.

70
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:20,920
[SPEAKER_08]: Although there are a large number of African American families that settled in the Smith Estate and were part of the Smith Estate, they were joined by many, many working class individuals

71
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:45,265
[SPEAKER_08]: on their same social status and skill level and I think that's very important to maintain especially given that this neighbourhood is seeing intense development given the location near the commuter rail and you know if they build certainly there have been changes to this neighbourhood but if they allow every building to be demolished there is going to be no history left here so I think it's

72
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:54,854
[SPEAKER_08]: is a building that's worthy of consideration and pause while we see if there's some interest in potentially changing the building for the better.

73
00:06:57,447 --> 00:06:59,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that's it for commission comments.

74
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:04,849
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we're gonna do next is we will open up the floor to public comments.

75
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:13,270
[SPEAKER_08]: If you would just interested in speaking for or against the project, just raise your hand kindly and we'll acknowledge you.

76
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:23,873
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you'll have a moment to speak and we'll try to keep comments to at max five minutes if possible or less, depending on the number of people speaking, of course.

77
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:25,573
[SPEAKER_08]: So public comments.

78
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Sharon, name and address for the record, please.

79
00:07:34,474 --> 00:07:37,057
[SPEAKER_06]: And manning street.

80
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:42,982
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you need to computers going here.

81
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:46,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

82
00:07:47,046 --> 00:07:49,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

83
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:55,173
[SPEAKER_08]: Jack, if you just mute yourself for a 2nd, you just got to mute your volume for a 2nd.

84
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:03,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let me turn mine off.

85
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:05,312
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn this thing off.

86
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:06,652
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

87
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:07,993
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn your computer off.

88
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,077
[SPEAKER_00]: Not available.

89
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:19,757
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you?

90
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:26,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm just going to turn this off and you turn your thing off.

91
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Just turn, no, no.

92
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:33,173
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as she speaks up, it should be okay.

93
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:35,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

94
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:37,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there you go.

95
00:08:37,454 --> 00:08:38,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

96
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:53,538
[SPEAKER_06]: I know nothing about this house until I saw it on the agenda, but it looks to me like just from looking at it briefly and then listening to the commissioners that it's a significant house.

97
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:54,978
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be preserved.

98
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:59,859
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know the neighborhood is important in this,

99
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:02,355
[SPEAKER_06]: for various reasons.

100
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:16,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is also, you know, I think Kit said it, that if you keep taking down historic houses, we're not going to have, can you still hear me?

101
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:26,975
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to have anything to put into a historic district if there is inclination to make them.

102
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:29,157
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's,

103
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:38,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I would say it seems to me it should be preferably preserved.

104
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:40,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I'll end.

105
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:44,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your comments.

106
00:09:45,647 --> 00:09:50,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Any additional comments from the general public?

107
00:09:50,852 --> 00:09:53,315
[SPEAKER_05]: If the public's done, I'd just like to respond to Sharon.

108
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:54,857
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a great comment, but I think

109
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:59,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, this board has always been very careful.

110
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:22,633
[SPEAKER_05]: This commission, excuse me, has been careful, uh, to try to balance the need for, you know, people to be able to expand the house to sometimes, sometimes the houses are just unusable because they're, they've been left to rot, you know, not every house in the method that's over a certain age is technically historic, but we don't save every house, right?

111
00:10:22,693 --> 00:10:24,313
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so we try to be,

112
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,254
[SPEAKER_05]: err on the side of caution and should be conservative.

113
00:10:28,334 --> 00:10:34,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And often the ones that we wrote on are four nothing, five nothing votes.

114
00:10:34,496 --> 00:10:38,858
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rare that it's a tight vote here because usually the evidence is in front of us.

115
00:10:39,798 --> 00:10:45,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's pretty obvious to not only the architects and the board, but any lay person in Medford could see that.

116
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,661
[SPEAKER_05]: They can see quality.

117
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:50,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, that's all.

118
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:50,642
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all set, Brian.

119
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:56,257
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, just real quick, any other public comments?

120
00:10:58,598 --> 00:11:00,820
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no hands raised, I'm going to close the public comments.

121
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Any final commissioner comments?

122
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:09,481
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, commissioners, the vote on the table is defined for significance.

123
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:14,022
[SPEAKER_08]: The yes vote would find for significance and pose the up to 18 month demo delay.

124
00:11:14,102 --> 00:11:18,583
[SPEAKER_08]: No vote moves the project towards allowing demolition.

125
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:22,724
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will go around the room as I see you.

126
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:23,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter?

127
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:26,084
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

128
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:28,065
[SPEAKER_08]: And Kit?

129
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:29,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

130
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:30,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And Doug?

131
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:31,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

132
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:32,966
[SPEAKER_08]: And I am a yes.

133
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:33,446
[SPEAKER_08]: So 4-0.

134
00:11:38,342 --> 00:11:38,602
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

135
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:41,343
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's all set.

136
00:11:41,363 --> 00:11:57,429
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll get the letter out and we'll reach out to the property owners and the applicants and see if we can't get them to engage with the demolition delay subcommittee, see what the plans are.

137
00:11:57,489 --> 00:12:01,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there was something before the zoning board, but I haven't seen anything else official.

138
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:03,371
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll get them to come to the,

139
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:13,165
[SPEAKER_08]: subcommittee and see what the plan is see if we can't come together for resolution or work out the next steps.

140
00:12:16,246 --> 00:12:19,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay all right so that takes care of 47 Holton Street.

141
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:23,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Next up on the agenda is 16 Manning Street commissioners.

142
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:29,752
[SPEAKER_08]: I sent around the MHC form B and apologies I failed to mention this in the very beginning.

143
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:45,202
[SPEAKER_08]: To all of those who are following along, I did put up the agenda and the MHC Form Bs and Area Forms on the Historical Commission website.

144
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:48,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to www.edfordhistoricalcommission.org

145
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:50,586
[SPEAKER_08]: and go to the news section.

146
00:12:50,606 --> 00:12:56,468
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the top blog post that has all the agenda information and attachments for tonight's meeting.

147
00:12:56,488 --> 00:13:02,389
[SPEAKER_08]: You can certainly follow along and grab the inventory form if you haven't already grabbed it.

148
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:11,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Inventory forms too are also available on the state's database, MACRIS, which is short for the Massachusetts Cultural Information System.

149
00:13:11,353 --> 00:13:18,475
[SPEAKER_08]: It's where all of our inventory forms that we spent the last 12-15 years developing with consultants end up

150
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:19,936
[SPEAKER_08]: in perpetuity.

151
00:13:20,876 --> 00:13:29,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay so commissioners I will start by taking a motion for or against preferably preserved status for 16 Manning Street please.

152
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:32,143
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of order.

153
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:33,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes sir.

154
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:43,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna recuse myself from this project due to a lack of objectivity and but I will still take notes

155
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, that'd be fantastic.

156
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:59,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you like me to read into the record all of the emails that we received while you're taking notes or to start the, before we go ahead with the motion or would you like to wait for the motion first?

157
00:14:04,615 --> 00:14:05,075
[SPEAKER_08]: You're muted.

158
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:06,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, wait for the motion.

159
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:09,677
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so commissioners I'll entertain a motion please.

160
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:15,729
[SPEAKER_05]: motion to find Manning Street perfectly preserved.

161
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:18,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

162
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:18,892
[SPEAKER_08]: And a second, please.

163
00:14:24,336 --> 00:14:25,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I have to second.

164
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:29,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Jen's here, but I will absolutely take a second.

165
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:33,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

166
00:14:33,352 --> 00:14:34,833
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

167
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:43,537
[SPEAKER_08]: As a, before we get into the discussion about this building, I need to quickly hop over to the historical commissions email.

168
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:52,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So earlier today, we received a petition from the residents along.

169
00:14:53,599 --> 00:15:03,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Manning Street and elsewhere in the city of Medford advocating for the preservation, preservation of this particular building.

170
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:05,850
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to enter that into the record.

171
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:19,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Their names and addresses are listed on the petition and there's 44 signatures according to this list.

172
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:29,126
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of the general public, I will start with the oldest email.

173
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:31,407
[SPEAKER_08]: We had, I think, 14 emails.

174
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:35,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, here we go.

175
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:47,197
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an email from Milva McDonald at 61 Monument Street asking to find for preferably preserved status.

176
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:55,235
[SPEAKER_08]: There is an email from Melanie Tringali, who lives on Forest Street, requesting preferably preserved status.

177
00:15:56,316 --> 00:16:01,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Email from Sharon Guzik, who is with us tonight at 10 Manning Street, advocating for preferably preserved status.

178
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:09,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Email from Megan Anderson, advocating for preferably preserved status.

179
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Email from Brian Anderson advocating for preferably preserved status.

180
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:18,245
[SPEAKER_08]: He lives just next door at 22 Manning Street.

181
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:25,290
[SPEAKER_08]: For email from Frank Perry advocating for preferably preserved status.

182
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:29,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Email from James E. King Jr.

183
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:32,775
[SPEAKER_08]: at 43 Manning Street advocating for preferably preserved status.

184
00:16:33,635 --> 00:16:38,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Email from Sheila and Rob Catalo at 48 Metcalf Street advocating for preferably preserved status.

185
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:51,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Email from Mark McAnee, who lives on South Street advocating for preferably preserved status.

186
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:55,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Email from Gerald Dock Jr.

187
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:57,407
[SPEAKER_08]: advocating for preferably preserved status.

188
00:16:58,507 --> 00:16:59,668
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an email from

189
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:04,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Terry Arnetta asking for preferably preserved status.

190
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:12,643
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the last email that we received today was from Kenneth Kraus at 50 Mystic Street advocating for preferably preserved status.

191
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:22,032
[SPEAKER_08]: So commissioners, having heard all of that in support of preferably preserved status, Doug, I'll start with you for comments.

192
00:17:23,472 --> 00:17:23,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.

193
00:17:24,073 --> 00:17:38,089
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the documentation for this house in this neighborhood on both the Form B for the building itself and the Form A for the neighborhood, both of which are on the Google Drive, the website you mentioned, Ryan.

194
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:47,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I think make a compelling case for this house, and this neighborhood is just really an important one in Medford's development.

195
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,981
[SPEAKER_05]: I never really knew it was called, growing up in Medford, that it was like Medford Square South or whatever.

196
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,742
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got a couple different versions of names.

197
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:55,303
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of those

198
00:17:56,143 --> 00:18:02,087
[SPEAKER_05]: odd little character of the neighborhood that I think is really nice.

199
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:13,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, there's been a hell of a lot of activity both along South Street and within this neighborhood the last 5 or 10 years as the development pressure keeps coming and coming, obviously.

200
00:18:14,616 --> 00:18:25,901
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is an excellent one to plant the flag on and say, let's pause this process and let's see if we can figure out this neighborhood and figure out a way to protect its character as best we can.

201
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:30,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

202
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:30,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Nick, you're next.

203
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:37,566
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll leave it up to the architects on the committee to comment on its architectural significance.

204
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:40,288
[SPEAKER_10]: They know far more than I do.

205
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:47,493
[SPEAKER_10]: several times a week to and from the Green Line.

206
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:59,415
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I have found really notable about it is that it is such an interesting sort of microcosm of historic development in Medford.

207
00:19:01,936 --> 00:19:07,297
[SPEAKER_10]: And it will abut the South Street Historic District.

208
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:08,938
[SPEAKER_10]: And I agree with Doug.

209
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:10,658
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is one to plant the flag on.

210
00:19:14,665 --> 00:19:15,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

211
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:19,693
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter is out.

212
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:20,835
[SPEAKER_08]: So Jen, that leaves you.

213
00:19:22,979 --> 00:19:25,202
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be the lone dissenter here, I think.

214
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:31,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually would vote no for preferably preserved status on this.

215
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:37,975
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an opportunity to include this house in the historic district that got created and it didn't happen.

216
00:19:39,036 --> 00:19:43,841
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it were that important, it should have been included in the historic district.

217
00:19:45,823 --> 00:19:47,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't think that

218
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:53,573
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, yeah, I'm just in complete disagreement on this one.

219
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:57,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that there was an opportunity, it wasn't taken.

220
00:19:58,019 --> 00:20:01,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And that process spoke for that.

221
00:20:02,144 --> 00:20:04,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will be a no vote on this one tonight.

222
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:10,685
[SPEAKER_08]: And because I count as a quorum, I'm going to put my two cents into this.

223
00:20:11,785 --> 00:20:21,811
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that this building has an opportunity to be looked at much closer than we usually have for properties.

224
00:20:22,752 --> 00:20:29,536
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a lot of modern finishes on the inside based on some recent real estate photos that were taken.

225
00:20:30,736 --> 00:20:49,505
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, but there's evidence of its previous past life, and as we've found with many buildings, the structures are often likely to yield important information about both how they're constructed, how they develop over time, how they change, and that information reflects the lives of the occupants.

226
00:20:50,206 --> 00:20:55,128
[SPEAKER_08]: In this particular case, it's most likely a single-family building that was converted over to a two-family.

227
00:20:55,468 --> 00:20:56,489
[SPEAKER_08]: This very common

228
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:06,873
[SPEAKER_08]: occurrence that happens in Medford as the city increased in density from the late 19th century when it was constructed into the 20th century.

229
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:15,777
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, there are, you know, clearly some, there's some originality and most likely the rest of it's sort of hidden behind multiple layers.

230
00:21:16,698 --> 00:21:24,762
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm sort of on the fence with this particular property but, you know, I think the goal of the

231
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:40,005
[SPEAKER_08]: demo delay is to consider both public comment and public feedback and to determine whether or not it's in the interest to be rehabilitated rather than demolished.

232
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:55,409
[SPEAKER_08]: And in this case, I think that the general public has spoken enough to tip this particular property in favor for demolition delay to see if we can come to some resolution that works for all sides of the table, not just the

233
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:57,050
[SPEAKER_08]: not just the proponent.

234
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,471
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's just my two cents on the matter.

235
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:05,013
[SPEAKER_08]: So having heard all the commissioner comments, I'm gonna open it up to public comments.

236
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:10,375
[SPEAKER_08]: We have received the petition and the 14 emails.

237
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:20,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anybody here who wishes to speak for demolition or for the project that's proposed?

238
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,690
[SPEAKER_08]: hold on, Jack, I'll get to you in just a second.

239
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:36,053
[SPEAKER_08]: And then anybody in favor of Preferred Preserved Status, if you just want to raise your hand, it's you next.

240
00:22:36,073 --> 00:22:37,353
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Jack, if you want to start.

241
00:22:39,994 --> 00:22:41,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll ask to unmute you.

242
00:22:41,634 --> 00:22:42,054
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

243
00:22:42,434 --> 00:22:44,055
[SPEAKER_08]: And just name and address for the record, please.

244
00:22:44,722 --> 00:22:45,723
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Jack Busemans.

245
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:52,166
[SPEAKER_00]: I live next door at 10 Manning Street and full disclosure, I'm the spouse of Sharon Busek.

246
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:54,647
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very biased here.

247
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:58,550
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to comment on the neighborhood.

248
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I have lived on 10 Manning Street now for 28 years.

249
00:23:03,412 --> 00:23:21,900
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 28 years and I've walked that neighborhood for that time, and I've seen it transformed mainly due to these developmental processes where somebody buys up a property and the lot gets transformed.

250
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the corner on Walnut Street, there was a magnificent

251
00:23:26,382 --> 00:23:30,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, you know, really anchoring neighborhood, it was taken down.

252
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:34,104
[SPEAKER_00]: And some cookie cutter, you know, house was put there.

253
00:23:34,885 --> 00:23:41,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Filling the lot completely, obstructing the view of a nice, you know, mansion-like structure in the background.

254
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:51,474
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I can name three or four examples of such developments, you know, within, you know, 200 feet of my house.

255
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:55,057
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the theme is clear.

256
00:23:55,157 --> 00:24:09,790
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, somebody will buy up a lot, a developer will buy a lot and either demolish the structure or, you know, modify it unrecognizably and maximize, you know, the footprint of whatever they put down there.

257
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:35,595
[SPEAKER_00]: changing the streetscape in the process where it becomes basically, I wouldn't call it an eyesore, that would be maybe too harsh, but it doesn't fit in the feeling of a street like Manning Street where you have houses of a certain size, certain setbacks, and all those things giving it a nice coherent whole 28 years ago.

258
00:24:35,635 --> 00:24:35,915
[SPEAKER_00]: In that time,

259
00:24:39,116 --> 00:24:48,285
[SPEAKER_00]: It has really changed, you know, there are some really big houses, you know, have been put up just across the street in the back of my house.

260
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:53,649
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really changed the character of the neighborhood.

261
00:24:55,431 --> 00:25:14,435
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would vote for a, I would argue for a, at the very least a demolition delay and, you know, hopefully get into a constructive discussion with the developer to try to, you know, come up with something that, you know, doesn't drastically change the character of the neighborhood.

262
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:16,175
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

263
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:17,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thanks.

264
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,596
[SPEAKER_08]: Sharon, did you have additional comments?

265
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:28,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I trust that all of you commissioners have read the letter I wrote, so I won't repeat that.

266
00:25:28,643 --> 00:25:37,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everybody else, but I would like to address Jen's comment about not being included in the historic district.

267
00:25:37,706 --> 00:25:39,067
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not overlooked.

268
00:25:41,328 --> 00:25:51,492
[SPEAKER_06]: The point of creating the historic district was to capture the pre-1855 houses before they got totally, you know,

269
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:57,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyway, you know, preserve those as best as possible.

270
00:25:57,928 --> 00:26:13,120
[SPEAKER_06]: And the historic, uh, district commission, uh, historical district, historic district commission at that time had, you know, just been going through the, uh, forestry historic district proposal.

271
00:26:13,801 --> 00:26:19,005
[SPEAKER_06]: And they realized that they had made too ambitious of a project.

272
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:22,608
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was decided to keep it to a small number.

273
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:29,164
[SPEAKER_06]: and get the pre-1855 houses in there, and then expand it as it went on.

274
00:26:29,485 --> 00:26:41,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, the commission itself, everybody's new on it, so they did not carry that out.

275
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:44,748
[SPEAKER_06]: So it had nothing to do with the value of this house.

276
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:48,509
[SPEAKER_06]: It had everything to do with getting those pre-1855 houses

277
00:26:52,241 --> 00:26:57,324
[SPEAKER_06]: district first, because they were probably the most important ones.

278
00:26:57,704 --> 00:27:09,492
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to put the reasoning behind it, it was not deemed insignificant to the historical district.

279
00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:14,135
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, for practical reasons, saving these other houses first.

280
00:27:15,002 --> 00:27:30,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so it seems like it seems like just to think about all of these buildings in the neighborhood, just like the commission prioritizes their 19th, 18th and 17th century buildings as high priority over

281
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:41,489
[SPEAKER_08]: the 20th century resources, the district commission prioritized those 1855 buildings to be the anchor of their district and with the intent of going back and making changes later.

282
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:54,233
[SPEAKER_08]: So perhaps this and other projects developing on the street might be the impetus for them to move forward before they start happening so that they can go back and accomplish their mission.

283
00:27:54,313 --> 00:27:54,993
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's up to the

284
00:27:56,714 --> 00:27:57,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's worthy.

285
00:27:57,495 --> 00:27:59,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to ask the question of how many other properties

286
00:28:08,811 --> 00:28:27,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there that are have this lot size that are vulnerable that were left on the table because I don't think it's an irrelevant discussion I mean this clearly this house is clearly right on the edge of the of the time the age and it wasn't added in and and now here we are with a demo on the table and

287
00:28:29,785 --> 00:28:30,786
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know.

288
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:32,567
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just really struggling with this.

289
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:36,469
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was so important, it should have been in the first batches.

290
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:40,451
[SPEAKER_06]: It was more important to get the 1855 houses in.

291
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:44,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So how many else are on the cusp besides this one?

292
00:28:44,693 --> 00:28:46,674
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there are others.

293
00:28:46,954 --> 00:28:49,036
[SPEAKER_06]: There's several on Manning Street.

294
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:50,176
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 22.

295
00:28:50,716 --> 00:28:52,557
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 15 across the street.

296
00:28:52,738 --> 00:28:58,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I think it was 21 was made unrecognizable.

297
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:02,342
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as I'm concerned, that doesn't need to be included.

298
00:29:03,343 --> 00:29:08,990
[SPEAKER_06]: These are all late century, 1870s to 1900 houses.

299
00:29:21,106 --> 00:29:23,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, off the top of my head, I'm not recalling.

300
00:29:23,227 --> 00:29:26,129
[SPEAKER_06]: There's something on Maple Street that could be roped in.

301
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:36,474
[SPEAKER_06]: And anyway, there were things on the other side of South Street as well.

302
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:42,097
[SPEAKER_02]: And how long has the district been official now, Ryan?

303
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,560
[SPEAKER_08]: There were three months.

304
00:29:50,008 --> 00:29:50,849
[SPEAKER_08]: relatively recently.

305
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:53,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Sharon is not on that board.

306
00:29:53,833 --> 00:30:01,522
[SPEAKER_06]: I just participated in a lot of the research and you know what I could do to help.

307
00:30:02,082 --> 00:30:08,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Indeed, and I do think the new board is sort of motivated to do something to help the community in addition to

308
00:30:11,056 --> 00:30:14,179
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of, you know, being able to administer their districts.

309
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:19,824
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully something, you know, hopefully something will come out of, you know, that time.

310
00:30:20,365 --> 00:30:31,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, if there's a lily, maybe they'll consider moving forward with the district, but you know, our, our job is to, you know, just move forward as we always have.

311
00:30:31,615 --> 00:30:34,738
[SPEAKER_08]: So, okay.

312
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:35,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other public comments?

313
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Well,

314
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:39,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I talk?

315
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:40,827
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Sid Gillett.

316
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:43,270
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the owner of 16 Manning.

317
00:30:43,651 --> 00:30:43,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Sid.

318
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:45,313
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address of the record, please.

319
00:30:45,914 --> 00:30:46,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

320
00:30:46,174 --> 00:30:49,078
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Sid Gillett from Treetop Group.

321
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:52,843
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the owner of 16 Manning Street.

322
00:30:55,526 --> 00:30:55,927
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

323
00:30:55,947 --> 00:30:56,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

324
00:30:57,232 --> 00:31:10,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I did heard, you know, I mean, you guys know better than me on historic and whatnot, but, you know, like Jen was saying, our, our intention over here is like, in past, we have tried to work.

325
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:15,296
[SPEAKER_01]: with you guys wherever it was possible in past.

326
00:31:15,336 --> 00:31:21,638
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, with this particular, when we bought this property, it was not just for the property.

327
00:31:21,658 --> 00:31:24,139
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a huge lot.

328
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:26,701
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge double lot.

329
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:34,404
[SPEAKER_01]: With the current zoning changes which are coming to the city, that's the intention.

330
00:31:35,865 --> 00:31:39,446
[SPEAKER_01]: The density which could be created according to that.

331
00:31:39,886 --> 00:31:40,366
[SPEAKER_01]: For me,

332
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just being frank over here to you guys.

333
00:31:48,712 --> 00:31:56,318
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys say it's a delay or whatever, so obviously we will abide by that.

334
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,461
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, we have to wait for it.

335
00:32:01,022 --> 00:32:01,642
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it is.

336
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:05,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with that amount of land, it's definitely going to be,

337
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:08,287
[SPEAKER_01]: new construction over there.

338
00:32:08,387 --> 00:32:14,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to let you guys that this is not just a small regular lot.

339
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:18,274
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes with a big lot with this property.

340
00:32:18,294 --> 00:32:22,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to make sure.

341
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:23,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

342
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:25,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you being frank with us and the community.

343
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:35,007
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's important to be transparent as to what the plan is and to, again, hopefully work for all that come into place.

344
00:32:37,037 --> 00:32:37,378
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

345
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:38,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

346
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Any additional comments?

347
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,322
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, seeing none, I'm going to close public comments.

348
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:49,426
[SPEAKER_08]: Commissioners, any additional comments before we take a vote on this project?

349
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:51,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

350
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:58,552
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion just to refer back was made by Doug Carr for preferably preserved status, second by Kit.

351
00:32:58,732 --> 00:33:01,554
[SPEAKER_08]: I will go around the room as I see you, Kit.

352
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:06,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes for preferably preserved.

353
00:33:06,682 --> 00:33:07,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

354
00:33:07,563 --> 00:33:07,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Doug?

355
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:09,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

356
00:33:10,846 --> 00:33:11,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Jen?

357
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:12,007
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

358
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,458
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'm a yes because I have to count towards the forum.

359
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:18,018
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's three, zero approved.

360
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:20,158
[SPEAKER_08]: No, three, one.

361
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:21,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Three, one, sorry.

362
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:22,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Three, one, sorry.

363
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:22,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

364
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:24,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Approved.

365
00:33:24,939 --> 00:33:28,780
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will get the letter out and we will invite Sid.

366
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:37,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Sid, we'll invite you to the historic districts subcommittee to talk about your plans and we'll see if there's anything you want to.

367
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:41,707
[SPEAKER_08]: discuss, you know, to see if there's any way we can move forward.

368
00:33:41,967 --> 00:33:49,396
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't want you to wait out the 18 months, of course, you know, we want a project to happen of some kind where everybody wins, the community wins, the neighbors win.

369
00:33:49,957 --> 00:33:53,862
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we'll start with that.

370
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:04,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving forward to our regular meeting, 26 Alfred Street, determination of significance.

371
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Commissioners, I sent around the MHC form B earlier.

372
00:34:08,742 --> 00:34:10,762
[SPEAKER_08]: We can start with a motion.

373
00:34:11,943 --> 00:34:12,663
[SPEAKER_08]: That might go from there.

374
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:19,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make a motion to find for significance.

375
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:23,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, one second.

376
00:34:31,121 --> 00:34:35,184
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second, but that's not an endorsement of my vote just to get the process moving.

377
00:34:35,204 --> 00:34:35,904
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

378
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:36,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

379
00:34:36,444 --> 00:34:37,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Jen.

380
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:58,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I know there was a fire here and I know that this might be kind of a moot conversation, but I think that the Form B to me at least warranted significance whether or not it becomes preferably preserved because the fire, you know, remains to be seen.

381
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:17,862
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think just based on the original age of the house and the lovely architectural description that was there and the recommendation for it being in a national register potential, I think at least warrants significance.

382
00:35:17,962 --> 00:35:23,484
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, if it's not preferably preserved, then that's a different conversation.

383
00:35:23,584 --> 00:35:27,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, it was at least worthy of significance.

384
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I will leave it at that.

385
00:35:31,644 --> 00:35:32,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Doug.

386
00:35:34,036 --> 00:35:37,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Ryan, just a quick question before I give my comments.

387
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:45,264
[SPEAKER_05]: The last page of the Form B does seem to kind of talk about this is still in process a little bit, and they don't actually check the boxes.

388
00:35:45,284 --> 00:35:51,969
[SPEAKER_05]: They mentioned that like a second phase of research has yet to be undertaken, but remains anticipated.

389
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:54,131
[SPEAKER_05]: It will provide a context to make recommendations.

390
00:35:54,231 --> 00:35:57,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So are we expecting more information from these guys in a timely manner?

391
00:35:58,554 --> 00:35:59,355
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't think so.

392
00:35:59,415 --> 00:36:04,818
[SPEAKER_08]: They would go through and we'd have to hire somebody to do the national register criteria.

393
00:36:05,778 --> 00:36:16,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And in terms of whether or not it's eligible, because we're a certified local government, the eligibility determination falls on us to determine whether or not we think it is or isn't.

394
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:19,827
[SPEAKER_08]: And then from there, it goes to the state and they either concur or don't concur.

395
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:24,688
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're sort of like in limbo, and we sort of rely on them.

396
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:28,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think maybe he or John might have forgotten to check the boxes.

397
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:43,674
[SPEAKER_08]: If he gives a criteria statement, he's saying that it is in some criteria, you know, that it's up to the actual determiners of who's determining DNR to decide whether or not they agree with him or not.

398
00:36:45,174 --> 00:37:00,223
[SPEAKER_08]: And in this particular instance, I think that the level of detail that the consultants did on Winter Hill, they believe that the neighborhood largely rises to the occasion of National Register status because it is an early development and it, you know, it's sort of mainly 19th century.

399
00:37:00,243 --> 00:37:04,565
[SPEAKER_08]: It relates to the broad patterns of people coming down from Somerville and developing into Medford.

400
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:11,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, of course, once the streetcars come in, they really accelerate its development there.

401
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:20,419
[SPEAKER_08]: uh you know i think all of that sort of plays into this house plus i'm particularly interested in the way that this house is sort of one of like

402
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:27,474
[SPEAKER_08]: less than 10 original buildings in this neighborhood on this side before 1875.

403
00:37:28,495 --> 00:37:30,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of neat.

404
00:37:30,396 --> 00:37:41,080
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of early buildings in the entirety of Winter Hill, but this side sort of gets, the 1875 map is very, it's filled with a lot of holes, let's put it that way.

405
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:44,922
[SPEAKER_08]: They may have laid out the streets, but they were filled with empty house lots.

406
00:37:45,688 --> 00:37:49,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess I'm kind of on the fence in this one.

407
00:37:49,391 --> 00:38:01,542
[SPEAKER_05]: I find the argument for historic district less convincing here than I would on the South Street or even the West Medford neighborhood just based on my knowledge of those neighborhoods.

408
00:38:01,722 --> 00:38:06,386
[SPEAKER_05]: But it does obviously have age going for it and some decent details.

409
00:38:08,428 --> 00:38:16,094
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm leaning towards yes, but I think the prefer preserve hurdle if we get to that point, it's going to be a lot higher next month if we get there.

410
00:38:17,715 --> 00:38:17,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

411
00:38:18,636 --> 00:38:18,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

412
00:38:19,337 --> 00:38:19,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Kit?

413
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:22,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

414
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:29,965
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in terms of historical significance, this seems like a no-brainer given all of the detail in the Form B.

415
00:38:31,621 --> 00:38:38,766
[SPEAKER_10]: But for me and Ann, we don't take into account the condition of the building.

416
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:48,494
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not been ordered down by the building department, which it hasn't, we have to go through the process as we would any other building.

417
00:38:49,355 --> 00:38:53,318
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that the preferably preserved status takes into account integrity.

418
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,761
[SPEAKER_08]: But integrity is not structural integrity.

419
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:58,221
[SPEAKER_08]: It's integrity of historic fabric.

420
00:38:58,521 --> 00:39:01,882
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a different threshold than significance.

421
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,444
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd say, to me, it's significant.

422
00:39:08,484 --> 00:39:09,124
[SPEAKER_10]: But I agree.

423
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:15,166
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, whether it rises to the level of preferably preserved is another conversation.

424
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:16,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

425
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:18,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Peter?

426
00:39:24,461 --> 00:39:28,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I find this one I'm on the fence about as well.

427
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:45,247
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think I'm more leaning towards not finding it significant because even though it does have the interesting association with tufts and stuff, I just don't think there's enough there that it would ever rise to preferably preserve.

428
00:39:45,327 --> 00:39:52,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't see what the point of would be of finding it significant other than just to delay these people for a month.

429
00:39:54,614 --> 00:39:55,889
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of where I'm coming down.

430
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,967
[SPEAKER_08]: the off chance that there is a tie vote here.

431
00:40:02,987 --> 00:40:17,037
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to chime in a little bit and just say that I don't normally see a building that relates solidly to the broad patterns of Medford history.

432
00:40:17,677 --> 00:40:21,620
[SPEAKER_08]: But in an unusual chance, this particular building does.

433
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:29,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I just mentioned the streetcar development in the neighborhood and how the early people involved with this house have some connection to the streetcar.

434
00:40:29,545 --> 00:40:38,733
[SPEAKER_08]: car lines are also a lot of brick building in the neighborhood, making in the neighborhood, just north of here.

435
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:46,056
[SPEAKER_08]: neighborhood literally called the Brickyards, and one of the early occupants is a brickmaker.

436
00:40:46,596 --> 00:40:55,186
[SPEAKER_08]: So it sort of relates to all of the entirety of the area, which is kind of rare.

437
00:40:55,226 --> 00:41:01,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes you just see people and they sort of, you know, work afar, work in Boston, but these people really have a very close connection.

438
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:01,813
[SPEAKER_08]: And

439
00:41:02,594 --> 00:41:03,835
[SPEAKER_08]: It's unusually small.

440
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:14,242
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that particular neighborhood is dense but the size of the building is really unusual and I'm surprised it didn't get added on or like enveloped by some larger building.

441
00:41:14,322 --> 00:41:25,609
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm inclined to pause for a hearing to hear what the neighbors might have to say or the general public might have to say to give them that hearing.

442
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:29,592
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's just my two cents and that's only if there's a tie vote.

443
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:32,608
[SPEAKER_08]: will I get an opportunity to vote here?

444
00:41:32,748 --> 00:41:37,049
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that said, anything else before we go into a vote?

445
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:39,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Jack, go ahead.

446
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:45,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this might not, if it's a tie.

447
00:41:45,592 --> 00:41:51,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess my question is, could we choose to bypass a perfectly preserved hearing?

448
00:41:53,754 --> 00:42:01,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, can we choose to bypass it if we feel that, you know, like significance is a little bit of a formality?

449
00:42:01,996 --> 00:42:03,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I feel, you know what I mean?

450
00:42:03,416 --> 00:42:06,997
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it either is or isn't significant.

451
00:42:07,057 --> 00:42:09,117
[SPEAKER_08]: And then from there, you know.

452
00:42:09,217 --> 00:42:09,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

453
00:42:09,417 --> 00:42:15,018
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we know that we don't want to preserve it because of the fire, like.

454
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:17,399
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean.

455
00:42:17,419 --> 00:42:18,539
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

456
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:22,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kind of I'm just throwing it out there because I don't know if there's precedent for this.

457
00:42:22,678 --> 00:42:27,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if we determine it's significant, it automatically rolls into a hearing, right?

458
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:42,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Because then we've determined it's significant and therefore every significant building is afforded a discussion, a dialogue, especially because we want the, you know, it's mainly for the general public to chime in on and either support or be against

459
00:42:43,348 --> 00:42:51,671
[SPEAKER_08]: the commission's determination of whether or not they should, this building should or should not be preferably preserved and therefore a demolition delay invoked on it.

460
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:53,652
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we can say no.

461
00:42:54,432 --> 00:42:58,614
[SPEAKER_08]: You can say a building is and then the building gets the chance.

462
00:42:58,674 --> 00:43:04,556
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's fair to say yes, we go forward and then no, we strike down having a public hearing.

463
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:11,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that's counterintuitive to the, if a building's significant, it's automatically going to get a hearing.

464
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:17,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know sometimes when there's fires like this, it's like, you know.

465
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:28,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Ryan, you mentioned, I think, when we spoke, that the fire department or the city has not taken this down, right?

466
00:43:28,242 --> 00:43:32,483
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not to the point where they're willing to put a big X on the building and take it down.

467
00:43:32,904 --> 00:43:33,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

468
00:43:34,937 --> 00:43:37,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's damaged, but it's not overwhelmingly damaged.

469
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:47,192
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the outside looks largely like, if you look at the demolition application pictures, it looks largely like the Google Street Views.

470
00:43:49,348 --> 00:43:53,050
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure that there's interior damage and that's a different question, right?

471
00:43:53,090 --> 00:44:07,297
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's, is, you know, that's not for us to determine tonight, but the question is, will be, if we determine that it is significant and it has a hearing, the question will be, is the integrity of, is the fabric, does it have integrity?

472
00:44:07,537 --> 00:44:08,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it remain?

473
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Has it been changed, et cetera?

474
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:17,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it worthy of preferably preserved status in the interest of the public to rehabilitate rather than get demolished?

475
00:44:18,563 --> 00:44:18,723
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

476
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:24,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, is there any way that I can speak?

477
00:44:24,784 --> 00:44:25,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the owner of this home.

478
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:27,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

479
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:28,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record.

480
00:44:29,489 --> 00:44:30,650
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Debra Zamuto.

481
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I live at 11 Placid Road in Newton.

482
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:35,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I've owned this home for over 20 years.

483
00:44:35,776 --> 00:44:38,079
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the original home I lived in with my family.

484
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:42,764
[SPEAKER_03]: This house was caught fire right before Thanksgiving last year.

485
00:44:44,505 --> 00:44:47,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Believe me, we had no intention of knocking this house down at any point.

486
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:53,534
[SPEAKER_03]: But this house, I have a letter which I think I attached from an engineer saying that it's structurally unfit.

487
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,640
[SPEAKER_08]: One second, she accidentally muted herself.

488
00:45:06,295 --> 00:45:08,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, the house is destroyed inside out.

489
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:15,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm paying $150 a week to a pest control company to keep rats out of it because the neighborhood is infested.

490
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:17,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I have had to have the doors.

491
00:45:19,243 --> 00:45:22,087
[SPEAKER_03]: boarded up three times from having people break into it.

492
00:45:22,107 --> 00:45:26,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is costing me a fortune to have this house sit there.

493
00:45:26,312 --> 00:45:29,856
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, have any of you actually driven by the house?

494
00:45:29,916 --> 00:45:32,720
[SPEAKER_03]: This house is vinyl sided, vinyl windows.

495
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,742
[SPEAKER_03]: There is nothing original in this home.

496
00:45:35,283 --> 00:45:38,306
[SPEAKER_03]: It has been remodeled probably 10 times before I bought it.

497
00:45:39,047 --> 00:45:51,835
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like just dragging this out is costing me and my family a fortune, or something that, I mean, have any of you actually driven by it, or are you just looking at pictures online?

498
00:45:55,357 --> 00:46:00,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I don't think you know when you're saying structural, like all these elements on the outside.

499
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:01,681
[SPEAKER_03]: The outside of the house is vinyl-sided.

500
00:46:01,901 --> 00:46:03,042
[SPEAKER_03]: The windows are vinyl-sided.

501
00:46:03,382 --> 00:46:07,965
[SPEAKER_03]: There is not one piece of architecture on this whole, I can guarantee you that, inside or out.

502
00:46:08,425 --> 00:46:11,147
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing has been ripped apart numerous times.

503
00:46:14,149 --> 00:46:16,571
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, there's nothing that can be done for this house.

504
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:21,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if I have to, I'll go to the building department and ask them for a letter to have it demoed.

505
00:46:21,844 --> 00:46:29,428
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I attached a letter from the structural engineers saying that the house is not sound and that it's structurally appeared.

506
00:46:30,169 --> 00:46:34,091
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm really not getting why you think that this whole needs to be.

507
00:46:37,952 --> 00:46:47,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, it's not, we're reviewing the application because the building department has told us they will not order it down because they do not feel it's a public safety nuisance, even with all of that information.

508
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:54,084
[SPEAKER_08]: But, and he, the building commissioner is the only one that can override the demo delay.

509
00:46:54,144 --> 00:47:03,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, out of fairness to all the applicants that come before us, everybody has to come before the commission if the building department chooses not to order a building down.

510
00:47:04,752 --> 00:47:11,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, I think that we'll take all that was just said into consideration in terms of how we move forward.

511
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:16,475
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do need to move forward with the process one way or the other.

512
00:47:16,555 --> 00:47:26,477
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, you know, if the commissioners vote that it is not significant, then the project moves forward, you can apply for your demo permit, and it'll get released from the permit system.

513
00:47:27,437 --> 00:47:31,582
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it is found significant, then we have to move to a hearing and move forward.

514
00:47:31,622 --> 00:47:32,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will.

515
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:37,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I think commissioners, do you guys have any other questions, comments?

516
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:40,852
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually have the letter from the engineer.

517
00:47:42,714 --> 00:47:45,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if it's in the package.

518
00:47:54,609 --> 00:48:04,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Kit, we get letters from engineers all the time, and everybody says that their house isn't structurally sound, but yet the commissioner, it's really his choice.

519
00:48:04,184 --> 00:48:07,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, the letter is a little bit of a moot point.

520
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:08,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, yeah.

521
00:48:13,352 --> 00:48:19,822
[SPEAKER_08]: But I, you know, again, the question was raised to the building department and they were not ordering it down.

522
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:26,631
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, you know, it's up to the commissioners on whether or not on how you how you want to proceed with significance.

523
00:48:29,035 --> 00:48:29,956
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to just move

524
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:39,933
[SPEAKER_08]: So commissioners a motion's been made to find for significance.

525
00:48:40,553 --> 00:48:42,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Jen made the motion, Doug seconded.

526
00:48:42,454 --> 00:48:44,395
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes vote is significant.

527
00:48:44,415 --> 00:48:45,035
[SPEAKER_08]: A no vote.

528
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,296
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not significant.

529
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:51,398
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, yes vote moves it towards hearing.

530
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:53,059
[SPEAKER_08]: No vote moves it towards demolition.

531
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:55,600
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll go around as I see you, Kit.

532
00:48:57,761 --> 00:48:58,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

533
00:49:00,202 --> 00:49:00,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug?

534
00:49:01,342 --> 00:49:01,582
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

535
00:49:03,243 --> 00:49:03,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Jen?

536
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:05,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

537
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:07,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter.

538
00:49:07,431 --> 00:49:07,471
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

539
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:10,193
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

540
00:49:10,373 --> 00:49:11,153
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a tie.

541
00:49:11,173 --> 00:49:11,954
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to vote.

542
00:49:12,954 --> 00:49:16,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that this building deserves a public hearing.

543
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:21,160
[SPEAKER_08]: However, I don't think it's going to change the outcome, the ultimate outcome.

544
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,521
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to vote no for this particular structure.

545
00:49:23,622 --> 00:49:33,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So two to three, it fails and we will get the letter out by the end of the week and release the permit and you guys can go forward.

546
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:34,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

547
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:35,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

548
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:36,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

549
00:49:40,235 --> 00:49:41,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Democracy in action.

550
00:49:41,957 --> 00:49:42,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

551
00:49:42,957 --> 00:49:43,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

552
00:49:44,799 --> 00:49:50,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Only the second time I have ever had to vote on a tie vote in this entire 17 year run with the commission.

553
00:49:51,404 --> 00:49:52,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Rarely does it happen.

554
00:49:52,965 --> 00:49:53,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

555
00:49:53,226 --> 00:49:54,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Upcoming potential demolition to views.

556
00:49:55,668 --> 00:49:57,269
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been going through the permit system.

557
00:49:58,150 --> 00:50:00,031
[SPEAKER_08]: I occasionally flag projects.

558
00:50:00,251 --> 00:50:04,515
[SPEAKER_08]: 173 Arlington street is a project that's being flagged because it's a total gut rehab.

559
00:50:05,195 --> 00:50:06,336
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got some period details.

560
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:09,519
[SPEAKER_08]: So we asked that they submit information.

561
00:50:10,259 --> 00:50:12,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Same thing with 46 Pinkert Street.

562
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:16,363
[SPEAKER_08]: There was proposal roof removal and third story being added to that building.

563
00:50:17,324 --> 00:50:22,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, it's come to us as part of the normal permit review.

564
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:25,489
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've asked them to submit for information for next month.

565
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:26,770
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't heard from either of them.

566
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,712
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a couple of permits that we've been sort of hanging in limbo.

567
00:50:30,772 --> 00:50:38,557
[SPEAKER_08]: So Jen, maybe we can reach out to the commissioner and see if he can't push some of those permits out, especially if they've gone dormant.

568
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:46,380
[SPEAKER_08]: So okay next up Oak Grove access road stormwater condition assessment.

569
00:50:46,440 --> 00:51:04,145
[SPEAKER_08]: So Oak Grove specifically the older portion but the entire cemetery is sort of getting a look from a master planning perspective and the consultant for the stormwater and road assessment reached out to us to ask if there were any preservation

570
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:08,651
[SPEAKER_08]: restrictions on the work that was being proposed there.

571
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:11,895
[SPEAKER_08]: They're currently assessing the road and what to do with all the stormwater.

572
00:51:13,518 --> 00:51:18,164
[SPEAKER_08]: We, from my perspective, we want to sort of see

573
00:51:19,947 --> 00:51:29,791
[SPEAKER_08]: the maintaining of the existing roads there and how they existingly handle stormwater because they were, you know, they sort of maintain their 19th century appearance.

574
00:51:30,872 --> 00:51:35,814
[SPEAKER_08]: But other than that, any sort, a lot of that stuff is underground.

575
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:38,855
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we'll never see it.

576
00:51:39,035 --> 00:51:44,737
[SPEAKER_08]: I did ask that they sort of come up with their assessment and their recommendations and then get back to us.

577
00:51:44,777 --> 00:51:46,058
[SPEAKER_08]: So they were proposing,

578
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:57,831
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe later this month, early August for a sort of quasi report to propose to the commission just so that you would just be in the loop for what's going on.

579
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:02,637
[SPEAKER_08]: And also as part of that, they are looking at

580
00:52:04,947 --> 00:52:18,456
[SPEAKER_08]: like maintaining, you're asked tonight, I think Teresa who is here, they're sort of, I think the cemetery trustees and Steve Brogan was eyeballing the restoration of the World War II monument that's just inside the front gate.

581
00:52:18,516 --> 00:52:21,017
[SPEAKER_08]: They restored the World War I monument a couple of years ago.

582
00:52:21,578 --> 00:52:27,261
[SPEAKER_08]: The trustees are actively trying to restore their maintenance building, is that correct?

583
00:52:28,142 --> 00:52:29,062
[SPEAKER_08]: That's also correct.

584
00:52:29,142 --> 00:52:34,103
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, money is being put into our beautiful cemetery grounds.

585
00:52:34,143 --> 00:52:36,024
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to sort of support them in their action.

586
00:52:36,844 --> 00:52:44,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there will be an opportunity to comment on the upcoming seven acre development there for the cemetery that's near the Brooks Estate.

587
00:52:45,006 --> 00:52:47,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, with the Brooks Estate, we want to comment on that, too, as well.

588
00:52:49,307 --> 00:52:50,647
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's also in the works.

589
00:52:50,747 --> 00:52:55,368
[SPEAKER_08]: So sort of everybody's while the Brooks Estate is doing their thing, the cemetery is doing their thing.

590
00:52:56,269 --> 00:52:58,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing my thing over across streets.

591
00:52:58,189 --> 00:52:59,930
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody seems to be getting action over there.

592
00:53:03,372 --> 00:53:04,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions before I move forward?

593
00:53:07,194 --> 00:53:08,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

594
00:53:08,975 --> 00:53:19,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I sent around, so for the State Historic Preservation Law changes, I sent around House Bill 993, which sort of being debated in the House, we just need to be very careful.

595
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,301
[SPEAKER_08]: It works in tandem with

596
00:53:24,545 --> 00:53:34,059
[SPEAKER_08]: accelerating housing production in a way that strips the Massachusetts Historical Commission and local historic district commissions of their power.

597
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,406
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just, I think it's important that the public

598
00:53:39,527 --> 00:53:49,812
[SPEAKER_08]: be made aware of said bill just so that they can review the language and offer their comments either for or against the bill.

599
00:53:49,972 --> 00:53:55,895
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we as a board can't take a political stance but individually as residents we can certainly take a look at it.

600
00:53:56,555 --> 00:53:58,297
[SPEAKER_08]: is a threat to historic preservation.

601
00:53:58,737 --> 00:54:03,181
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not the first bill that's been introduced with similar language.

602
00:54:03,261 --> 00:54:06,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, preservation is sort of under threat.

603
00:54:06,283 --> 00:54:11,187
[SPEAKER_08]: There are a lot of advocates that are advocating for historic preservation.

604
00:54:11,307 --> 00:54:21,176
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, our voice will be one of many, but I think you guys should take a look at it and certainly consider that as you move forward.

605
00:54:24,038 --> 00:54:24,978
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for new business.

606
00:54:25,158 --> 00:54:28,079
[SPEAKER_08]: I did have one item that we took care of.

607
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:29,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I mentioned it in my email.

608
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:45,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Teresa's here because the Mystic River Watershed Association is going to be applying for an assessment of all of the four main bridges in Medford from the Mystic Valley Parkway up to Winthrop Street.

609
00:54:45,622 --> 00:54:47,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I missing or Auburn Street even further than that?

610
00:54:48,923 --> 00:54:49,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Auburn Street as well yes.

611
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:55,985
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah so there's four bridges in total and some questions about whether or not they were nationally registered listed.

612
00:54:56,025 --> 00:54:59,066
[SPEAKER_08]: They are all listed so they're covered under that.

613
00:54:59,086 --> 00:55:08,508
[SPEAKER_08]: So they did not need our support but I do think it's important to voice our support for a potential project if they want it.

614
00:55:09,628 --> 00:55:15,110
[SPEAKER_08]: So unless anybody has any objections this is to assess the bridges for future restoration.

615
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:23,611
[SPEAKER_08]: unless anybody has any objections, we can just put together a quick little letter saying we support the project, go forth and apply for funding.

616
00:55:23,731 --> 00:55:29,575
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, hearing none, we'll go forward and do that.

617
00:55:30,956 --> 00:55:36,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else for new business that I, while we're here, otherwise I'll roll into.

618
00:55:38,632 --> 00:55:42,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, for vacant seats, I reached out to the mayor's office, no new applications yet.

619
00:55:42,853 --> 00:55:52,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So I did put out that we were looking for members, if the members of the general public are interested in serving on the commission, we'll have some upcoming vacancies.

620
00:55:53,176 --> 00:55:58,077
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have one open seat right now, probably have two more at the end of the year.

621
00:55:58,257 --> 00:56:08,100
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're interested in joining the commission, we'll be happy to take your resume and have a meeting with you guys and certainly encourage you to join.

622
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,023
[SPEAKER_08]: have all this fun that we have.

623
00:56:10,043 --> 00:56:17,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I sent around for preservation ordinance discussion, I sent around

624
00:56:20,695 --> 00:56:30,485
[SPEAKER_08]: a document a little bit earlier with a couple of motions on it that talk about the administration of our demo delay, and that's where this sort of falls into place.

625
00:56:30,545 --> 00:56:31,145
[SPEAKER_08]: So two things.

626
00:56:31,986 --> 00:56:39,634
[SPEAKER_08]: I do think, and we've discussed this for a while, I do think it's important that we reaffirm our commitment to allowing

627
00:56:40,615 --> 00:56:56,173
[SPEAKER_08]: pre-screen for our buildings, that's the concrete block garages, wood frame block garages that we allow to be demolished on the regular because they don't have any sort of architectural or historic importance on the usual.

628
00:56:56,254 --> 00:56:56,374
[SPEAKER_08]: But

629
00:56:58,038 --> 00:57:08,503
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing I would like to consider, which is sort of, tonight's sort of poignant because it relates to how we just discussed the house on Winter Hill.

630
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:15,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we should prioritize now, as part of the demo delay review, all pre-1900 buildings and

631
00:57:17,968 --> 00:57:26,694
[SPEAKER_08]: make a statement about how they are significant so that they can automatically be afforded an opportunity to have a public hearing.

632
00:57:27,455 --> 00:57:32,499
[SPEAKER_08]: Not only will it give them the public hearing, but it will expedite review.

633
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:34,180
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it just,

634
00:57:40,064 --> 00:57:52,447
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, nine times out of 10, we have found for significance and, you know, it's sort of, you know, rare that we find a building that's not significant.

635
00:57:52,467 --> 00:57:59,268
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it is, it's because of very particular circumstances, like it has burned out or, you know, something like that.

636
00:57:59,328 --> 00:58:09,251
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like us to consider reviewing the documentation and deciding whether or not we think it's important.

637
00:58:09,511 --> 00:58:09,731
[SPEAKER_08]: And I,

638
00:58:10,851 --> 00:58:17,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's going to become more and more important as the demo delay comes up against proposed zoning changes.

639
00:58:17,795 --> 00:58:23,939
[SPEAKER_08]: As we've seen tonight, you know, we have a project that the applicant is waiting for new zoning.

640
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:30,103
[SPEAKER_08]: There will be other projects that, you know, places that the new zoning comes up against.

641
00:58:31,563 --> 00:58:32,284
[SPEAKER_08]: old buildings.

642
00:58:32,484 --> 00:58:45,390
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's important that we make a stance so that we can sort of set the ground rules for how the demo delay is administered in the future, so that no matter who's on this board, we've sort of set a direction for the next couple of years.

643
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:57,015
[SPEAKER_08]: And then our job will be not to worry about the administration of the demo delay, that will sort of fall into place, but rather we can continue to advocate for those historic resources through zoning changes, through historic districts, through

644
00:58:57,995 --> 00:59:07,359
[SPEAKER_08]: zoning overlays and all sorts of fun stuff that communities do when they have sort of made their processes like a well-oiled machine.

645
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Thoughts on what I sent around?

646
00:59:16,603 --> 00:59:17,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's good.

647
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:17,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on board.

648
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:22,585
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other thoughts by commissioners?

649
00:59:24,614 --> 00:59:35,482
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I think it's good to get ahead of things, Brian, that what your process you described makes a lot of sense to not have to do this a hundred times if we have the same general consensus about what we're looking for.

650
00:59:37,103 --> 00:59:40,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I'm going to go ahead and memorialize these two items.

651
00:59:40,146 --> 00:59:44,649
[SPEAKER_08]: So Peter, just for your benefit, in the word document that I sent around are my two motions.

652
00:59:44,689 --> 00:59:50,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to read them for the general public just so that they're memorialized, but they're going to be word for word.

653
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,635
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just copy and paste them right into your meeting minutes.

654
00:59:54,763 --> 00:59:57,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so first motion.

655
00:59:57,084 --> 01:00:02,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to empower the demo delay subcommittee to prescreen certain applications for unassuming outbuildings.

656
01:00:03,187 --> 01:00:08,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Commission shall pass on applications for any shed concrete structures or wood frame garages.

657
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:20,656
[SPEAKER_08]: This fast track for review does not extend to buildings that are distinguished or rare, including, but not limited to any pre-1900 resource, carriage houses, barns, or workshops as examples.

658
01:00:21,216 --> 01:00:26,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Commission reserves the right to alter this policy if the conditions of the landscape change in the future.

659
01:00:26,777 --> 01:00:29,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have a second on said motion?

660
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:30,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

661
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:33,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'll go around the room.

662
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:39,300
[SPEAKER_08]: As I see you, Kit.

663
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

664
01:00:43,441 --> 01:00:43,941
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jen?

665
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:44,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

666
01:00:45,481 --> 01:00:45,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter?

667
01:00:50,152 --> 01:00:50,713
[SPEAKER_08]: And Doug?

668
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:51,614
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

669
01:00:51,954 --> 01:00:52,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug's a yes.

670
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:56,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, 4-0 approved.

671
01:00:57,001 --> 01:00:58,783
[SPEAKER_10]: Before you read the other one, can I make a comment?

672
01:00:59,163 --> 01:00:59,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, go ahead.

673
01:01:05,894 --> 01:01:09,298
[SPEAKER_10]: and any pre-1900 buildings sort of being fast-tracked.

674
01:01:09,678 --> 01:01:26,097
[SPEAKER_10]: I completely agree, but I actually wonder, sort of given the conversations that we've been having tonight, if it shouldn't be any building 75 years or older on a lot size over X, because I think what we're going to see a lot more of are

675
01:01:26,537 --> 01:01:37,645
[SPEAKER_10]: any oversized lots, there's going to be an instant request for a demolition permit that will entirely raise some of these buildings.

676
01:01:37,665 --> 01:01:40,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that's what Sid essentially just said.

677
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:46,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I agree.

678
01:01:50,114 --> 01:01:50,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if

679
01:01:51,815 --> 01:01:55,478
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if we should treat 20th century resources somewhat differently.

680
01:01:55,578 --> 01:02:01,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can say, this is going to move every pre-1900 building into a hearing.

681
01:02:03,745 --> 01:02:06,708
[SPEAKER_08]: But the 20th century resources are sort of a little bit different.

682
01:02:06,868 --> 01:02:07,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, you know,

683
01:02:11,322 --> 01:02:14,223
[SPEAKER_08]: are we just trying to exclude?

684
01:02:14,243 --> 01:02:18,084
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not trying to exclude the pre-1900 buildings on the smaller lots, right?

685
01:02:18,104 --> 01:02:22,485
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just trying to target the additional 20th century lots on a circuit size?

686
01:02:23,226 --> 01:02:31,668
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, essentially, I mean, my thought is if the point is to give the public an opportunity of hearing, why not?

687
01:02:31,708 --> 01:02:36,450
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we've seen over the last several years that some of these

688
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:48,033
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm thinking about Forest Street, actually, and what a ruckus that caused, because people do care very deeply.

689
01:02:48,193 --> 01:02:55,795
[SPEAKER_10]: And the sentiment in the city right now, given the zoning changes as such, that, I mean, I think we just have to be cognizant of it.

690
01:02:58,756 --> 01:03:02,617
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not proposing this.

691
01:03:02,677 --> 01:03:04,058
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm offering it up for discussion.

692
01:03:05,442 --> 01:03:06,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I make a comment?

693
01:03:06,403 --> 01:03:19,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the things that would concern me about that is that the lot size right now is so in flux with the zoning changes being discussed.

694
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that we could put a number on that.

695
01:03:24,790 --> 01:03:45,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, 20th century resources are sort of I, I'm, I'm sort of treating this as the pre 1900 buildings are going to go right to a public hearing to automatically no matter what it is, how, you know, as long as it's before pre 1900 that's a rare and diminishing less than 3500 in the entire city resource and that that definitely affords a

696
01:03:47,438 --> 01:04:14,572
[SPEAKER_08]: affords a public hearing this doesn't change how we would approach the pre you know the 20th century buildings we would still get an application and we'd still you know order a form b review that particular building and determine whether or not it is or isn't significant i mean if it's not if it's not if it's not significant it really doesn't matter what the lot size is it's just it's the building on that lot that's going to make it significant ryan if i could chime in here the um

697
01:04:16,398 --> 01:04:20,079
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I think doing this, I like that it's streamlining the process.

698
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:29,962
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that we have been criticized, constructively criticized, as we could be doing this in a faster method, you know, just in broad general terms.

699
01:04:29,982 --> 01:04:34,783
[SPEAKER_05]: From the time we order the Form B to the time we, you know, we're trying to get ahead of things.

700
01:04:34,863 --> 01:04:40,205
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, I think we've seen incremental but important progress in trying to make our process more efficient.

701
01:04:40,225 --> 01:04:42,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So I see that as a positive.

702
01:04:42,686 --> 01:04:42,826
[SPEAKER_05]: But

703
01:04:44,133 --> 01:04:49,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have found pre-1900 buildings not significant on this board, right?

704
01:04:49,974 --> 01:05:00,816
[SPEAKER_05]: We have done that, not once, but dozens of times over at least the 10 years plus I've been here, and you, I can't remember the exact number of years.

705
01:05:01,577 --> 01:05:03,577
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to balance those out.

706
01:05:03,717 --> 01:05:12,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I get what you're doing, and it does jump to the one-step process, and that becomes the most important, which I think there's great value in that.

707
01:05:13,499 --> 01:05:16,880
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do believe that there are some buildings that are preempted and they're not significant.

708
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I just do believe that.

709
01:05:23,763 --> 01:05:26,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, I mean that it's a very real possibility.

710
01:05:26,184 --> 01:05:34,327
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that, you know, uh... But Doug, in that instance, would we just pass on review?

711
01:05:36,213 --> 01:05:37,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't say pass on review.

712
01:05:37,835 --> 01:05:43,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say maybe that as part of this, the commission reserves the right to still determine significance.

713
01:05:46,165 --> 01:05:57,232
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, but I don't want to undermine, you know, what I'm, what I'm saying like, oh, every building is significant except for, you know, like either they, they are as a collective whole or they aren't.

714
01:05:57,312 --> 01:06:01,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like the building tonight shares the same on winter Hill, right?

715
01:06:01,815 --> 01:06:06,278
[SPEAKER_08]: The, the, that property shares a lot of the same characteristics as the other buildings on the winter Hill.

716
01:06:06,298 --> 01:06:08,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but rather than,

717
01:06:09,843 --> 01:06:17,747
[SPEAKER_08]: rather than nitpick each individual project, it's just easier to send it to a hearing and it's a one-step process where the public gets to chime in.

718
01:06:18,047 --> 01:06:21,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Whereas in most cases, the determination of significance is just done by the commission.

719
01:06:21,789 --> 01:06:25,431
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's effectively abolishing our end of the work.

720
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:42,151
[SPEAKER_08]: to, you know, to take away, it allows us to do other things like focus on those, you know, the determinations for the 20th century resources, or even the multitude of projects that we're working on, or, you know, working with projects that we put a delay on, et cetera.

721
01:06:42,171 --> 01:06:54,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's, some of it is to alleviate work of the commission by just simply saying that all of these particular buildings are priority, we get a chance to, you know, to alleviate some of our own work.

722
01:06:56,071 --> 01:07:24,102
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the other thing, too, because we've been constructively criticized, as Doug put it, in the past about the process taking a long time, we have tried to combine steps one and two if we know something's coming in with regards to taking an application and determining significance the same night in order to shave off a little time for folks.

723
01:07:26,368 --> 01:07:43,276
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think we're already being aggressive with hearing issues from folks in the past and trying to alleviate that process a little bit and make it a little bit speedier to move things along where necessary.

724
01:07:43,856 --> 01:07:46,718
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just to play devil's advocate,

725
01:07:47,843 --> 01:07:51,304
[SPEAKER_02]: do we need to also do this if we're already doing that, right?

726
01:07:51,344 --> 01:08:01,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're already, you know, trying to shave off that first 30 days if at all possible, if we know something's coming in and we have the documentation to do it.

727
01:08:04,189 --> 01:08:08,991
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that enough or do we wanna do this other step as well?

728
01:08:09,751 --> 01:08:13,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Just an anecdote, maybe to help answer the question.

729
01:08:13,232 --> 01:08:17,054
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I was approached by a neighbor today

730
01:08:21,122 --> 01:08:24,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for other reasons, but he said, well, I can't do that.

731
01:08:24,103 --> 01:08:26,244
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a historical commission meeting tonight.

732
01:08:26,264 --> 01:08:29,125
[SPEAKER_07]: And he said, oh, the hurry up and make them wait board, right?

733
01:08:30,025 --> 01:08:35,707
[SPEAKER_07]: So we already have a bad rep just amongst the public in general.

734
01:08:35,747 --> 01:08:36,427
[SPEAKER_07]: They view us

735
01:08:37,823 --> 01:08:39,904
[SPEAKER_07]: as an impediment to doing what they want to do.

736
01:08:39,924 --> 01:08:48,509
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, if I could have said, oh yeah, we are streamlining it, you know, we took this significant step.

737
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:57,675
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I think I would be for it because it does really do something concrete to streamline it.

738
01:09:01,397 --> 01:09:10,605
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, on the other hand, this guy is a contractor, so, you know, I don't know if that's a totally unbiased statement.

739
01:09:10,645 --> 01:09:24,837
[SPEAKER_02]: But to your point, Peter, like, you know, we've run into this situation in the past where, you know, people claim they don't know or they didn't have the information when they were acquiring the property, if they were buying it for a project.

740
01:09:25,798 --> 01:09:28,980
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, now it just kind of makes it a little bit simpler.

741
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:29,381
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like...

742
01:09:30,738 --> 01:09:37,980
[SPEAKER_02]: you're already on the historical radar if it's a pre-1900 house.

743
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:43,441
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of communication, in terms of being transparent and putting things out there to the community.

744
01:09:44,041 --> 01:09:57,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like there's such a juxtaposition with this conversation tonight where we're trying to somewhat speed up our process, but yet the whole zoning conversation in the city is to slow things down.

745
01:09:59,968 --> 01:10:05,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and yeah, in many ways, this process... It's like you can't win on either argument, right?

746
01:10:06,172 --> 01:10:07,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, right.

747
01:10:07,293 --> 01:10:11,135
[SPEAKER_08]: But in many ways, this is going to be the process that brings the two together, right?

748
01:10:11,155 --> 01:10:15,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's zoning, and then there's the people that want to do whatever they want.

749
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:20,879
[SPEAKER_08]: but we're the slowdown in between that gets the better project.

750
01:10:21,539 --> 01:10:24,562
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't want everybody to just simply do what they want.

751
01:10:26,484 --> 01:10:34,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Ideally, zoning would be worked in with design review, but because we know how fast things are moving, design review is, as far as I know, not being really considered.

752
01:10:35,613 --> 01:10:51,943
[SPEAKER_08]: we're it like we are the maintenance of making sure that i know we're not design review but we're you know we're demo review to the point of making sure that the existing buildings fit in with the the existing neighborhood rather than just simply building whatever you please that fits as long as it fits zoning

753
01:10:52,243 --> 01:11:10,057
[SPEAKER_02]: but also like kind of back to the argument about the districts it's like no it's up to them to really you know kind of take a step up at this point from a preservation standpoint if you want to preserve some character of neighborhoods because now the only way it might happen

754
01:11:11,258 --> 01:11:14,880
[SPEAKER_02]: is through districts, because we will still have an expiration.

755
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:23,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Sid pointed out, and Ryan, as you and I chatted earlier, there's way too much money on the table now with a project like that.

756
01:11:24,403 --> 01:11:27,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And under no circumstances are they going to work with us.

757
01:11:27,465 --> 01:11:29,846
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to wait it out.

758
01:11:29,866 --> 01:11:34,788
[SPEAKER_02]: An 18 months is not long enough for them to sit on a $6 million project.

759
01:11:34,948 --> 01:11:35,348
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll wait.

760
01:11:37,283 --> 01:11:39,503
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll wait with all these units they can put on.

761
01:11:39,643 --> 01:11:51,306
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I mean, I really feel like the burden is going to be shifting now over to the district commission because, you know, they should have a list of vulnerable lots.

762
01:11:51,966 --> 01:11:56,987
[SPEAKER_02]: They should know, you know, the houses, you know, in the district that are still vulnerable.

763
01:11:57,527 --> 01:12:03,208
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they really need to step up their game, in my opinion, because it's going to be gone like that.

764
01:12:05,666 --> 01:12:15,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they don't start, you know, stepping up and really making an effort to save some of these things, it's going to be too late.

765
01:12:16,943 --> 01:12:18,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can only do so much.

766
01:12:18,324 --> 01:12:19,025
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know.

767
01:12:19,545 --> 01:12:19,846
[SPEAKER_02]: We can.

768
01:12:19,866 --> 01:12:34,419
[SPEAKER_08]: They really need a consultant to do some master level planning for the entire city in conjunction with the other planning, you know, with the zoning consultant, with the historical commission, you know, to just say, you know, you know, you guys are experts.

769
01:12:34,539 --> 01:12:39,344
[SPEAKER_08]: We're here to facilitate, you know, bring it all together and let them hire it.

770
01:12:39,364 --> 01:12:42,607
[SPEAKER_08]: So Teresa, that might be a good, good project for them coming

771
01:12:44,564 --> 01:12:51,408
[SPEAKER_05]: surveys we've commissioned over the past 12 plus years, isn't that basically the foundation for that?

772
01:12:51,788 --> 01:12:53,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, that's the base.

773
01:12:53,228 --> 01:12:58,791
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it take a matter of, you know, the consultant working out, you know, what is zoning impacts?

774
01:12:58,831 --> 01:13:00,412
[SPEAKER_08]: What does the housing production plan say?

775
01:13:00,492 --> 01:13:06,255
[SPEAKER_08]: What would city council support versus, you know, and what are the residents say?

776
01:13:06,335 --> 01:13:13,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are the areas that they want districts that right now that will support, you know, people just voluntarily diving into them, that sort of thing.

777
01:13:13,979 --> 01:13:17,162
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's not our purview.

778
01:13:17,322 --> 01:13:21,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll circle back to just keeping the conversation to the demo delay.

779
01:13:21,767 --> 01:13:28,053
[SPEAKER_08]: For now, we're sort of a timeline in the cog.

780
01:13:28,934 --> 01:13:32,518
[SPEAKER_08]: But as we come up more and more against zoning, what do we do?

781
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:47,478
[SPEAKER_08]: sure we can expedite, but if somebody, I know somebody can sit on their hands for 18 months, but we really, you know, it's not going to look good if everybody all of a sudden just does that.

782
01:13:47,498 --> 01:13:57,182
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I know, I know the onus, the onus is always on the part of the, the builder, the owner and the applicant to engage us.

783
01:13:58,002 --> 01:14:00,964
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we'll make one, we'll make effort and initial contact.

784
01:14:01,044 --> 01:14:03,805
[SPEAKER_08]: And they just have to tell us whether or not they're going to sit it out or not.

785
01:14:05,817 --> 01:14:07,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter, you were starting to say something.

786
01:14:07,539 --> 01:14:08,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

787
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:17,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's frustrating to me that I think, well, there's this emphasis for new affordable housing, right?

788
01:14:18,929 --> 01:14:25,815
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel like that's just used by developers to make more money.

789
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:27,956
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an excuse, right?

790
01:14:30,731 --> 01:14:45,313
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the need is real, and personally, I don't really want to be on the wrong side of that divide, if you will, and be this NIMBY type curmudgeon who says,

791
01:14:46,745 --> 01:15:02,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's great, we need more affordable housing, but, you know, not in my neighborhood, not in my little, not next door to me because, you know, then, you know, I think it's a really tough problem.

792
01:15:02,797 --> 01:15:09,842
[SPEAKER_07]: These two, you know, social needs are kind of almost directly in conflict.

793
01:15:10,043 --> 01:15:14,206
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really hard, like, cause I feel like,

794
01:15:15,642 --> 01:15:17,724
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford will just become like Somerville.

795
01:15:19,146 --> 01:15:25,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And Somerville's nice in its own way, but it's not Medford.

796
01:15:25,233 --> 01:15:32,681
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't really want Medford to become exactly like Somerville.

797
01:15:32,982 --> 01:15:35,645
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's what's happening, right?

798
01:15:37,053 --> 01:15:44,982
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just going to say real quick, Medford has this unique problem of being many parts of a whole.

799
01:15:45,022 --> 01:15:49,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford is Medford, but Medford is also Malden, Somerville.

800
01:15:51,013 --> 01:16:12,176
[SPEAKER_08]: uh winchester arlington you know there's and i think doug you said this to me earlier as you move from east to west the community is radically different from one side to the other north to south east to west and i think that's you know that needs to be really considered with zoning and right now it seems like it's not it's like we're the buffer to

801
01:16:13,817 --> 01:16:21,101
[SPEAKER_07]: the transition zone between, you know, Somerville and Winchester, you know, like exact, which is exactly what you're saying, I think.

802
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:27,225
[SPEAKER_07]: And, but the pressure is, you know, there's pressure on both sides.

803
01:16:27,305 --> 01:16:29,586
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

804
01:16:29,666 --> 01:16:36,530
[SPEAKER_10]: And the only tool is the demolition delay, which is sort of like, all we've got is a hammer.

805
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:41,113
[SPEAKER_10]: And what we really need is like, you know, some planes and a screwdriver.

806
01:16:41,213 --> 01:16:42,494
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it's a, it's a really,

807
01:16:44,934 --> 01:16:59,642
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a clumsy tool for everything that we're trying to do with it, and we're going to get the criticism from the other side, too, and we already are, that I hear, which is people saying, you know, what is the historic commission doing to protect the history of Medford?

808
01:17:00,063 --> 01:17:07,327
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they don't understand that the only tool that we have is the demolition delay, and that's only good for 18 months in certain circumstances.

809
01:17:08,187 --> 01:17:31,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Right we did just so everybody knows we did get a couple of emails a couple from people in the areas being looked at right now in West Medford zoning are asking us to engage in the zoning process and then just last week the Alicia's office reached out to all the department heads asking that all the departments engage with the zoning process as well.

810
01:17:31,539 --> 01:17:31,679
[SPEAKER_08]: So

811
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:38,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we're sort of have this motion on the table, but we should also set up sort of a subcommittee that tackles that.

812
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:44,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Alicia did send out a beautiful summary of each of the potential zonings that they're considering.

813
01:17:44,945 --> 01:17:52,909
[SPEAKER_08]: There's one for West Medford, then there's a portion of it for ADUs, and then there's some additional miscellaneous stuff.

814
01:17:52,929 --> 01:17:55,670
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like a three-part system.

815
01:17:56,331 --> 01:17:58,452
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we really should set up a

816
01:17:59,712 --> 01:18:26,740
[SPEAKER_08]: a small subcommittee so we can engage in that and get comments back to her because they're due by the 23rd so we're really under the gun i think they i think actually they extended it a little bit longer than that but uh to give us more time but we really need to uh think about did you circulate those documents are they are they on our drive yeah i they're not on the drive yet but i can send them around okay yeah we better get moving on that

817
01:18:31,846 --> 01:18:34,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So back to the motion.

818
01:18:35,149 --> 01:18:43,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want to just delay it for 30 days and jump on the zoning stuff and hold off on implementation?

819
01:18:43,655 --> 01:18:49,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do you want to establish a slightly separate subcommittee that sort of handles all of the issues?

820
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:57,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that when I pinged some people for feedback, there were some questions on, oh, the length of time is actually good.

821
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:09,412
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, for the part of those people who want to mobilize to sort of, you know, support the commission in their preferably preserved and significant status, but you know, and notification sort of key.

822
01:19:09,472 --> 01:19:17,655
[SPEAKER_08]: So it has, you know, passing the all night pre 1900 buildings are significant and moving into the hearing is,

823
01:19:18,215 --> 01:19:47,001
[SPEAKER_08]: you know it's one thing but it also does have some ramifications you know they're still going to get notified through the signage through the legal ads but those are not really you know solidly effective manners to be notified sometimes it takes a little bit of time for word to sprinkle down so um i i i'm gonna i'm gonna put it out there that we maybe table this for a couple meetings to digest it and also

824
01:19:49,323 --> 01:19:59,279
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost might want to wait until we have a full board again to vote, but I'm just throwing it out there.

825
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:04,347
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Ed's not here tonight and, you know.

826
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:11,041
[SPEAKER_08]: I will now make the executive decision and nobody's opposing.

827
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:13,722
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll table it and then we'll give it some time.

828
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:18,423
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll ask Ed to ping in, you know, and just say, this is on the table.

829
01:20:19,223 --> 01:20:28,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And just maybe see how the conversations go over the next two to, you know, one to two meetings with regards to zoning and where things are going.

830
01:20:28,326 --> 01:20:32,187
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe it would make more sense for us to enact this or not.

831
01:20:34,043 --> 01:20:35,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we tabling motion one too?

832
01:20:36,684 --> 01:20:38,924
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we've already voted on motion one.

833
01:20:39,845 --> 01:20:45,446
[SPEAKER_08]: That one's just a re-up of a previously established motion back in like 2017, but I thought it'd be good to update to 2025.

834
01:20:45,586 --> 01:20:45,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.

835
01:20:45,846 --> 01:20:47,006
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

836
01:20:52,888 --> 01:20:58,129
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so we'll table that until, what are we in?

837
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:00,130
[SPEAKER_08]: July, August, September?

838
01:21:01,803 --> 01:21:03,484
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see how the next two couple of meetings go.

839
01:21:03,544 --> 01:21:04,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

840
01:21:04,605 --> 01:21:05,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Cross street pilot program.

841
01:21:05,806 --> 01:21:08,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I sent around a picture of one of the headstones.

842
01:21:09,629 --> 01:21:10,630
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like night and day.

843
01:21:10,910 --> 01:21:13,532
[SPEAKER_08]: The cemetery really does need a hefty cleaning.

844
01:21:14,393 --> 01:21:19,177
[SPEAKER_08]: The cemetery consultants did offer to do a cleaning day.

845
01:21:19,197 --> 01:21:22,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked the trustees, I asked some of the DPW guys.

846
01:21:22,279 --> 01:21:24,301
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some interest in coming and learning.

847
01:21:24,361 --> 01:21:26,482
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very simple and

848
01:21:27,343 --> 01:21:32,944
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe we can spend like a couple of days cleaning all the headstones in advance of their preservation.

849
01:21:33,844 --> 01:21:48,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Once we're sort of properly trained it's very easy to do and we'll sort of set up the consultants for success in the spring of 2026 if CPC graciously funds the full project for the cemetery restoration, which I'm hoping they will.

850
01:21:49,767 --> 01:21:52,627
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm working on the application now.

851
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:53,808
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like $125,000 all in

852
01:21:57,490 --> 01:22:00,613
[SPEAKER_08]: project for the restoration of the wall and all the headstones.

853
01:22:00,693 --> 01:22:02,054
[SPEAKER_08]: So that should be good.

854
01:22:02,614 --> 01:22:06,197
[SPEAKER_08]: That includes a pretty large contingency, but it's always good to have contingency.

855
01:22:07,018 --> 01:22:08,559
[SPEAKER_08]: So, okay.

856
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:12,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have anything on the historic district commission.

857
01:22:12,743 --> 01:22:15,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we can remove this action item for future agendas.

858
01:22:15,525 --> 01:22:23,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really think we need to, it's good to have a liaison, but I think we can remove it from our agenda from here on out unless anybody has any objections.

859
01:22:24,545 --> 01:22:27,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless there's something relevant they're doing that we need to know about, I would say, take it off.

860
01:22:27,889 --> 01:22:29,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

861
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:33,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Teresa is our staff person, so Teresa usually does a good job.

862
01:22:33,134 --> 01:22:34,395
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to have them all over there.

863
01:22:38,636 --> 01:22:39,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Properties under demo delay.

864
01:22:39,737 --> 01:22:40,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have anything.

865
01:22:40,838 --> 01:22:48,884
[SPEAKER_08]: The only other thing I think we need to discuss, which is not tonight, but maybe a following meeting, is if we want to release 56 Wareham.

866
01:22:49,404 --> 01:22:55,909
[SPEAKER_08]: We discussed previously whether or not they've sort of waited out, but let's discuss that at the next meeting.

867
01:22:57,397 --> 01:23:11,445
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there was like a pause on their timeline and because of the discussion that I think we've had last, like two months ago or so on the condition, we may choose to release him sooner than later.

868
01:23:11,465 --> 01:23:19,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have any form Bs, don't have anything on permits.

869
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:22,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been checking the permit system is sort of clear right now.

870
01:23:22,892 --> 01:23:26,014
[SPEAKER_08]: There's only a couple of new projects that have come in.

871
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:33,071
[SPEAKER_08]: for CPC projects, waiting on the archeologists to pick a date for their dig.

872
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:41,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I just met with Teresa earlier today and Tim McGivern, DBW, to sort of get the tree work lined up.

873
01:23:42,179 --> 01:23:45,022
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's gonna be December-ish time.

874
01:23:45,042 --> 01:23:51,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully it'll go out to bid in, if I leave myself six months, that should be more than enough time to get all that done, so.

875
01:23:53,081 --> 01:23:55,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me jump in on a couple of things on CPC.

876
01:23:55,162 --> 01:24:01,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad Teresa's here because a couple of things came up at the last meeting, which I think was just a week ago, Teresa.

877
01:24:02,789 --> 01:24:10,975
[SPEAKER_05]: One is that we gave some emergency funds to the folks at the armory building to do some exterior restoration.

878
01:24:11,896 --> 01:24:15,959
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got a kind of failing exterior wall on their hands right now.

879
01:24:18,081 --> 01:24:19,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was kind of a unique situation.

880
01:24:19,762 --> 01:24:23,445
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on the National Register, and it's obviously private.

881
01:24:23,505 --> 01:24:24,566
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not publicly owned.

882
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:38,756
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a little bit of a stretch for us, but we thought they agreed to up their public access to that important building and house, I think, Teresa, at least two events a year, I think, for a couple of years, something like that.

883
01:24:38,776 --> 01:24:41,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Two events a year for the next 10 years.

884
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,277
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

885
01:24:43,778 --> 01:24:45,919
[SPEAKER_05]: And we wanted to kick the process off.

886
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:52,685
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have to find, like, this is a small fraction of the dollars they're going to need to do the whole building.

887
01:24:55,107 --> 01:24:57,709
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, but we wanted to kind of get the ball rolling.

888
01:24:57,969 --> 01:25:02,593
[SPEAKER_05]: But there, you know, these guys were all condo owners in a very big building.

889
01:25:02,613 --> 01:25:04,795
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very expensive building to maintain.

890
01:25:05,703 --> 01:25:11,989
[SPEAKER_05]: But I thought they might come before this commission tonight to talk about just some details.

891
01:25:12,009 --> 01:25:23,161
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to follow the national standards for how to restore the masonry, how to do the grout properly like we've done at the Brooks Estate and other places over the years.

892
01:25:24,242 --> 01:25:25,183
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll follow up on that.

893
01:25:25,323 --> 01:25:26,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one item.

894
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:28,306
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to let you guys aware of that.

895
01:25:29,327 --> 01:25:38,336
[SPEAKER_05]: The second one was that there was a general discussion in our database of surveys that we've done over the past 10-plus years.

896
01:25:39,557 --> 01:25:49,867
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people on the CPA didn't know that even existed, and they were looking to see if there's a way we could make those files more accessible by

897
01:25:51,928 --> 01:25:56,809
[SPEAKER_05]: not just the macros database, because that's actually not that user-friendly from my own experience.

898
01:25:57,429 --> 01:26:10,971
[SPEAKER_05]: But somewhere on Medford's website, if we could have it, just our survey results, you could search by street, by neighborhood, whatever, just find a way to have it better, to make it more accessible.

899
01:26:11,191 --> 01:26:16,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody who's thinking buying a house can maybe find the Form B that exists on that house right now.

900
01:26:17,072 --> 01:26:20,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless the real estate agent offers it, they're probably not going to find it.

901
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:31,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's funny you should mention that because I talked with Jess Farrell, former commissioner who has now sort of set out on her own into the consulting world.

902
01:26:31,739 --> 01:26:41,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things she was talking to me about was looking at something of similar nature, not for survey, but for the,

903
01:26:41,727 --> 01:26:45,351
[SPEAKER_08]: City's historic artifacts in the public library.

904
01:26:45,831 --> 01:26:52,318
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will ask her if it's something that they could put together as sort of like a way to display the database on our website.

905
01:26:52,338 --> 01:26:54,020
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a little bit of limitation.

906
01:26:54,040 --> 01:27:00,787
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we can probably find a way to integrate it into WordPress, but it may just be easier to

907
01:27:02,113 --> 01:27:06,077
[SPEAKER_08]: see if there's some sort of software or something out there that we can host.

908
01:27:06,277 --> 01:27:21,170
[SPEAKER_08]: We could simply do PDFs of all the forms, but then there's all the back information of cataloging them and making keywords searchable and that sort of thing, like you're asking, and how to pull them up.

909
01:27:22,471 --> 01:27:43,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I know macros is not user friendly, they have limitations themselves, you know, they have like parameters so we can get much more detail that they can, you know, like we might say, you know, say there's important architects, we can add those and call those out, you could sort projects by that to see how many buildings built, you know, so we can get more detail at the local level.

910
01:27:45,333 --> 01:27:46,774
[SPEAKER_08]: But just something to think about.

911
01:27:47,094 --> 01:27:55,537
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll ask Jess to see if she wants to come talk to us about what we can do and how much said thing would cost.

912
01:27:55,557 --> 01:28:01,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, 90% of our stuff is on macros, so I don't want to duplicate efforts.

913
01:28:01,379 --> 01:28:05,441
[SPEAKER_08]: But if there is a way to make it more user-friendly, I'll consider it.

914
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:09,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's all we're looking for is just to figure out a plan.

915
01:28:09,322 --> 01:28:11,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, Teresa, if you have anything I missed on that.

916
01:28:12,732 --> 01:28:15,453
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I was just going to say, I think that would be a great idea too.

917
01:28:15,473 --> 01:28:20,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people are hungry for this great information that lives in various different places.

918
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:31,316
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we can pull it together as a central repository, I think the CTC would welcome an application for a small amount of money to hire a consultant to help with that work.

919
01:28:32,156 --> 01:28:33,896
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I think this would be a great thing.

920
01:28:36,737 --> 01:28:50,312
[SPEAKER_04]: a great thing for us to get back to the residents and this is information that they should, I feel, you know, have access to and it would certainly make it easier for CPC as we review some projects and just in general for research purposes.

921
01:28:50,952 --> 01:28:52,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I would support that.

922
01:28:55,457 --> 01:28:55,657
Great.

923
01:28:55,978 --> 01:28:56,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else?

924
01:28:58,961 --> 01:28:59,161
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

925
01:29:02,425 --> 01:29:02,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, good.

926
01:29:02,905 --> 01:29:06,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's moving, uh, our survey projects, Sagamore Vale.

927
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:06,846
[SPEAKER_08]: It's done.

928
01:29:06,866 --> 01:29:07,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the survey.

929
01:29:07,787 --> 01:29:10,988
[SPEAKER_08]: I just uploaded it to, um, my computer.

930
01:29:11,088 --> 01:29:17,790
[SPEAKER_08]: I will upload it to Google drive so that we can see it's a series of area forms that sort of break down the entire neighborhood.

931
01:29:17,870 --> 01:29:20,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Every buildings, uh, has some basic information.

932
01:29:20,671 --> 01:29:27,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, and as they come up for demo or we want to expand on that, we'll add some MHC inventory forms to them.

933
01:29:28,957 --> 01:29:32,019
[SPEAKER_08]: We did just get the word that Hastings Heights is moving forward.

934
01:29:32,859 --> 01:29:37,301
[SPEAKER_08]: The feds were sort of holding the funding at the federal level hostage.

935
01:29:38,101 --> 01:29:48,486
[SPEAKER_08]: They have finally released that to the state historic preservation officers and that will trickle down to our survey and planning project so we can start that up finally once more.

936
01:29:49,027 --> 01:29:51,808
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be going, that's the large neighborhood between

937
01:29:52,899 --> 01:29:54,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Martin Simons District and West Medford Square.

938
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:59,102
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll fill in a huge gap of survey from what we last did the West Medford project.

939
01:30:01,184 --> 01:30:05,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I have no other old businesses or anything else before we do meeting minutes.

940
01:30:05,886 --> 01:30:08,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

941
01:30:08,327 --> 01:30:10,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Hearing none, Kit sent around meeting minutes.

942
01:30:11,349 --> 01:30:12,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think they were great.

943
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:13,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter made some edits.

944
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:16,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything else we missed?

945
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:24,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'll take a motion to accept Kit's minutes with Peter's edits.

946
01:30:29,452 --> 01:30:29,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So moved.

947
01:30:29,932 --> 01:30:31,392
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a second.

948
01:30:35,093 --> 01:30:35,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

949
01:30:36,193 --> 01:30:36,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Jen.

950
01:30:42,934 --> 01:30:44,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'll go around as I see you, Kit.

951
01:30:45,782 --> 01:30:46,022
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

952
01:30:47,542 --> 01:30:48,003
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jen?

953
01:30:48,843 --> 01:30:49,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

954
01:30:49,723 --> 01:30:50,203
[SPEAKER_08]: And Peter?

955
01:30:50,703 --> 01:30:50,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

956
01:30:51,684 --> 01:30:51,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug?

957
01:30:52,484 --> 01:30:52,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

958
01:30:53,364 --> 01:30:53,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

959
01:30:53,584 --> 01:30:56,185
[SPEAKER_08]: 4-0 approved.

960
01:30:56,765 --> 01:30:57,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else before we adjourn?

961
01:30:58,626 --> 01:31:06,648
[SPEAKER_10]: We actually have to approve the May minutes because we tabled them at the end of the June meeting because Doug and I were not at the May meeting.

962
01:31:07,208 --> 01:31:08,848
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't have a quorum to approve them.

963
01:31:10,469 --> 01:31:14,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take a motion to approve the May minutes that I accidentally put on the website.

964
01:31:17,455 --> 01:31:18,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

965
01:31:19,916 --> 01:31:22,338
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an impeachable offense there, Ryan.

966
01:31:23,538 --> 01:31:24,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm technically not the chair.

967
01:31:24,959 --> 01:31:26,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

968
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:29,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you just throw me under the bus?

969
01:31:29,641 --> 01:31:31,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe a little bit.

970
01:31:31,602 --> 01:31:32,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Penalty for being late, though.

971
01:31:37,225 --> 01:31:37,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Jen made a motion.

972
01:31:38,026 --> 01:31:38,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I have a second?

973
01:31:39,386 --> 01:31:39,747
[SPEAKER_10]: I did.

974
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:42,248
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll second.

975
01:31:46,475 --> 01:31:47,535
[SPEAKER_08]: It was seconded.

976
01:31:47,735 --> 01:31:48,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

977
01:31:48,396 --> 01:31:49,676
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go around as I see you, Kit.

978
01:31:51,717 --> 01:31:53,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, actually I still can't approve them, right?

979
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:54,417
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I wasn't at the main meeting.

980
01:31:55,618 --> 01:31:57,278
[SPEAKER_10]: One, two, three, four.

981
01:31:57,378 --> 01:31:58,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, were you at the main meeting?

982
01:31:58,979 --> 01:31:59,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

983
01:32:00,019 --> 01:32:00,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

984
01:32:00,839 --> 01:32:01,739
[SPEAKER_08]: So Jen?

985
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:03,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

986
01:32:06,461 --> 01:32:06,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter?

987
01:32:07,361 --> 01:32:07,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

988
01:32:08,161 --> 01:32:08,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug?

989
01:32:09,001 --> 01:32:09,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

990
01:32:09,682 --> 01:32:10,342
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm a yes.

991
01:32:10,962 --> 01:32:14,203
[SPEAKER_08]: So four, zero, one abstention.

992
01:32:19,253 --> 01:32:20,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Meeting has passed.

993
01:32:20,093 --> 01:32:20,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to adjourn?

994
01:32:22,253 --> 01:32:24,434
[SPEAKER_08]: So moved.

995
01:32:24,454 --> 01:32:25,374
[SPEAKER_08]: 837, a second?

996
01:32:25,534 --> 01:32:33,136
[SPEAKER_08]: I got it.

997
01:32:33,597 --> 01:32:33,136
837.

998
01:32:34,097 --> 01:32:34,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Kit?

999
01:32:35,657 --> 01:32:35,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1000
01:32:36,918 --> 01:32:37,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Jen?

1001
01:32:37,698 --> 01:32:37,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1002
01:32:38,418 --> 01:32:38,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter?

1003
01:32:39,418 --> 01:32:39,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1004
01:32:40,338 --> 01:32:40,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Doug?

1005
01:32:42,099 --> 01:32:42,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1006
01:32:42,579 --> 01:32:45,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we setting up the subcommittee on the zoning before we leave?

1007
01:32:46,301 --> 01:33:06,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, why don't I send out an email, take volunteers because there's going to be, we should do one for zoning, maybe one to tackle the rest of this, uh, just to keep an eye on the administration of the demo delay and sort of, uh, figure out all the works and, you know, have like a, why did we determine go one way or the other?

1008
01:33:06,666 --> 01:33:08,727
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, we'll take volunteers on that.

1009
01:33:09,067 --> 01:33:12,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, because we don't have a seven board.

1010
01:33:14,212 --> 01:33:18,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Forum is still four, so three or less, please, on your boards.

1011
01:33:19,057 --> 01:33:21,460
[SPEAKER_08]: So three volunteers for each board is fine.

1012
01:33:22,841 --> 01:33:25,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I'll send out an email to the rest of the board.

1013
01:33:26,605 --> 01:33:27,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you all.

1014
01:33:27,506 --> 01:33:31,570
[SPEAKER_08]: And plus Ed might want to participate, so we'll make sure that he's included in the conversation.

1015
01:33:32,351 --> 01:33:33,252
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you all.

1016
01:33:33,453 --> 01:33:33,953
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good night.

1017
01:33:34,373 --> 01:33:35,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.
