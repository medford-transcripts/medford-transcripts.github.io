21
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:23,370

[SPEAKER_06]: It will be a drive-through set up on Saturday, April 30th, 2016, 10 to 2 p.m.

23
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,957
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a residential drop-off only.

24
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:38,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, they're not able to accommodate physicians' offices.

25
00:01:40,124 --> 00:01:48,267
[SPEAKER_06]: And this has been announced by reverse 9-1-1 in the city, and I'm sure the details are available on the city website.

26
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:58,510
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're very grateful to the members of the Metro Police Department, and of course, Karen Rosa, Director of Public Health, for their efforts in this matter.

27
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Vice President Lungo Kern for request to suspend the rules.

28
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:06,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Vice President, for what purpose do you ask the suspension?

29
00:02:07,923 --> 00:02:14,828
[SPEAKER_09]: to take motions, orders, and resolutions, paper 16-427 and paper 16-430.

30
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:21,254
[SPEAKER_09]: As the first one, we have our city solicitor here in case any of the residents or myself or the council have questions.

31
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,518
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be helpful to get an explanation from him as the public's been wanting one.

32
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:32,123
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Vice President Lungelkorn for suspension of the rules to take papers 16-427,

33
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,070
[SPEAKER_06]: and 16-430.

34
00:02:37,313 --> 00:02:38,214
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

35
00:02:38,895 --> 00:02:39,756
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

36
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:42,499
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion carries.

37
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:44,481
[SPEAKER_06]: 16-427 offered by Vice President Lundell Kern.

38
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:54,713
[SPEAKER_06]: Be resolved that the building department updates the city council with regards to what is taking place at 0 Walnut Street, which is the lot in front of 23 Walnut Street.

39
00:02:55,956 --> 00:03:04,421
[SPEAKER_06]: be it further resolved that the city solicitor look into whether Zero Walnut Street is a buildable lot based on applicable zoning.

40
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:05,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Vice President.

41
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:07,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President De La Russo.

42
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:16,649
[SPEAKER_09]: This has obviously come to our attention several months back when the developer has, since the developer has been redoing the home that's currently there.

43
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,132
[SPEAKER_09]: It currently looks beautiful and I believe it's for sale.

44
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:27,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, there's a petition that went around with regards to the tree located at 0 Walnut Street.

45
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:33,191
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the parcel directly in front of 23 Walnut Street.

46
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:35,151
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's been some questions.

47
00:03:35,212 --> 00:03:37,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I know some residents have emailed me.

48
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:39,153
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also got a phone call.

49
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:46,415
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually, yesterday, I was stopped by somebody who lives on Metcalf Street when I was in the area with regards to just questions.

50
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:47,476
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on?

51
00:03:47,656 --> 00:03:48,956
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the parcel zoned?

52
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:50,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it buildable?

53
00:03:52,136 --> 00:03:58,280
[SPEAKER_09]: get some information from the city solicitor this week, since I've had the resolution on, as well as Ms.

54
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Aggie Tudin, who is our tree warden.

55
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:12,770
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was gonna hope to ask city solicitor to come and just make a presentation, just so I wouldn't have to read the email that was sent to us with a number of pertinent points.

56
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:20,035
[SPEAKER_09]: But really, the residents are concerned about parking on Metcalfe Street not taking, obviously,

57
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:22,353
[SPEAKER_09]: leaving the tree the way it is.

58
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:34,177
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the developers looked into and possibly retained a arborist to see if there's ways that the tree can remain while still building a home on that parcel.

59
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:37,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I have questions, obviously, for the building department.

60
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:42,620
[SPEAKER_09]: What is that parcel zoned and what can be built on that parcel?

61
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,802
[SPEAKER_09]: From a council standpoint, just would like to be able to inform the residents.

62
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there gonna be any more curb cuts?

63
00:04:51,952 --> 00:05:00,637
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, if we could have the city solicitor up here just to maybe answer some of those questions and then just discuss a few things, that would be helpful.

64
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:03,818
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could, Madam Vice President, where is this tree?

65
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,301
[SPEAKER_09]: The tree is in the Zero Walnut Street parcel.

66
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:12,063
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's on the private property of Zero Walnut Street?

67
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:15,444
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the parcel in front of 23 Walnut Street.

68
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:16,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there's a petition.

69
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:18,786
[SPEAKER_09]: About 250 people signed a petition.

70
00:05:18,846 --> 00:05:20,327
[SPEAKER_09]: They're interested in the tree remaining.

71
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:29,720
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know — I'm not sure if the developer has stated whether or not he intends to keep the tree, but I know, thankfully, he's looking into it.

72
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:39,702
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're hoping — you know, obviously, there are high hopes up there, but it sounds like, from some of these emails I've got this week, that's looking a little grim, to say the least.

73
00:05:39,722 --> 00:05:41,223
[SPEAKER_09]: The Press.

74
00:05:41,243 --> 00:05:41,663
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

75
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:42,783
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome, Mr. Solicitor.

76
00:05:42,803 --> 00:05:43,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

77
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:44,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Rumley.

78
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,124
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

79
00:05:45,164 --> 00:05:46,364
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Mark Rumley.

80
00:05:46,904 --> 00:05:47,924
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a city solicitor.

81
00:05:48,044 --> 00:05:50,405
[SPEAKER_14]: I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

82
00:05:51,231 --> 00:06:01,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I saw this resolution on the council, uh, tonight, and I mentioned to, uh, to counsel Lungo, uh, that I, I'd be happy to at least share with what I know.

83
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:02,622
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd be very brief about this.

84
00:06:03,343 --> 00:06:08,528
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd say at the outset, I have not looked into this matter from the point of view of parking or curb cuts.

85
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:14,634
[SPEAKER_14]: The issue came to me after a, a concerned citizen sent an email to the mayor

86
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:17,177
[SPEAKER_14]: and the mayor asked me to look into the matter.

87
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:26,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, as Vice President Lungo mentioned, the lot at Zero Walnut Street has a beautiful beech tree, pretty much right in the middle of it.

88
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:32,949
[SPEAKER_14]: So the question becomes, the question which has been asked is, is this a buildable lot?

89
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,654
[SPEAKER_14]: And the answer to that is, and I've talked to the building department about this, so there's no uncertainty here.

90
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,777
[SPEAKER_14]: Dimensionally, it is a buildable lot.

91
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:55,832
[SPEAKER_14]: from a functional point of view, that is to place a structure on that lot and to be able to build it without the requirement of any variance, it would be necessary to take down that tree.

92
00:06:56,552 --> 00:07:06,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I'm not saying I'm an advocate of that, but I'm saying that the only way to build a home there, build a structure there without the necessity of a variance is to take down that tree.

93
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:26,015
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, because of the concern raised by so many of the residents in that area, and good people who are concerned about this tree, even though it's on private property, I asked John Bavuso in the building department if he could ask the developer to meet with us in the law department, and he did.

94
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:36,042
[SPEAKER_14]: And the developer said that it was his intention to build on that lot at Zero Walnut Street, and if he kept

95
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:46,166
[SPEAKER_14]: the tree and, let's say, built around the tree, that it would be necessary for him to seek certain variances because he'd be too close to boundary lines, etc.

96
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:53,890
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing that he mentioned is that he has an arborist whom he works with who has said

97
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:59,194
[SPEAKER_14]: that if he does that, it's going to be necessary to cut some of the roots on that tree.

98
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:07,238
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's a possibility, depending upon how extensive that root cutting is, that the tree may die, or it might become unstable.

99
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:20,825
[SPEAKER_14]: So I also broached with him the possibility, and this is a bit unique, but I talked to our tree warden, Aggie Tudin, about this, and we looked at other cities and towns, and in one city or town,

100
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:28,855
[SPEAKER_14]: did save a tree, but it was a different set of facts, by having a conservation easement placed on the tree.

101
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:36,216
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was in, I believe it was Brookline, and that tree was a tree which was in front of the birthplace of President Kennedy.

102
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:38,177
[SPEAKER_14]: So there was a little bit of difference there.

103
00:08:38,737 --> 00:08:43,518
[SPEAKER_14]: And that conservation easement was put on by agreement of the parties.

104
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:50,460
[SPEAKER_14]: The developer of this particular lot at Zero Walnut Street did not indicate that he was

105
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:56,020
[SPEAKER_14]: inclined to engage in a conservation easement with us.

106
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:07,905
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I have asked Mr. Bavuso to make inquiry of the developer if he would share with us his arborist report so that we could look at it.

107
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:13,688
[SPEAKER_14]: And if indeed there isn't one, we might be able to assist him in getting

108
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:15,940
[SPEAKER_14]: a full arborist report.

109
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,189
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think that that would be beyond the scope of the right thing to do as a municipality to help with that report.

110
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:29,859
[SPEAKER_14]: Not to help the developer, but to get answers to questions raised by the residents in that area.

111
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:43,926
[SPEAKER_14]: Over the years, working in the law department and as city solicitor, it's these types of issues when they come up, they're not so easily answered as to say, this is private property, so it's not the city's business.

112
00:09:44,386 --> 00:09:56,129
[SPEAKER_14]: While that ultimately may be the result, it behooves everyone to try to work towards solutions which are consensual with everyone, and that's what we're trying to do.

113
00:09:57,327 --> 00:09:59,929
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's pretty much the status of all this right now.

114
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:04,331
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a little bit more, but those types of discussions are really in a state of flux.

115
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:24,363
[SPEAKER_14]: I do agree with Vice President Lungo that this situation is grim in terms of saving that tree, but nonetheless, we are making every attempt we can to try to be an instrument of reaching an accord with all parties, even though those prospects may not be very positive.

116
00:10:26,383 --> 00:10:27,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, City Solicitor Emily.

117
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:34,386
[SPEAKER_09]: One question I guess I have is with regards to needing variances from the zoning board.

118
00:10:34,906 --> 00:10:45,889
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if there is that petition, I think there's 250 people that, you know, obviously to get a petition of that many with regards to this tree, it means something to the neighborhood.

119
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:46,550
[SPEAKER_09]: It means something.

120
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:53,332
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the petition extends far up to South Medford in both directions, so would it be

121
00:10:54,237 --> 00:11:14,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is there any way that the city can work with the zoning board, the developer, and maybe the residents to try to get a meeting together to see if we can appease the developer by maybe having the residents there to advocate for a variance?

122
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,587
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand what you've just said, and it really comes down to this.

123
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:28,967
[SPEAKER_14]: The developer would have no need to go before the Zoning Board of Appeals if the tree comes down, because he won't need any variances.

124
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:46,858
[SPEAKER_14]: Conversely, if he chooses to relocate the structure in a fashion which would save the tree, I don't think it would be too much to say that almost everyone on that petition would probably come and speak in favor of his request for a variance.

125
00:11:47,228 --> 00:11:52,230
[SPEAKER_14]: But that, of course, is a matter of speculation, but I don't think it's very speculative.

126
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,032
[SPEAKER_14]: I think people would support that to save the tree.

127
00:11:55,872 --> 00:12:08,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you be willing to say within the next week, just draft up something, or I don't know if this would maybe be the building department or the zoning board, somehow get the council a list of what variances would be needed?

128
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:11,611
[SPEAKER_09]: if that tree was to stay and he was to build?

129
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:17,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Normally, the answer to that question, Madam Vice President, would be yes, that would be — we'd be happy to provide you that.

130
00:12:17,716 --> 00:12:29,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Except even that is a matter of speculation unless something's applied for it, because we don't know exactly where the house would be and what variances would be necessary — where the house would be on that lot.

131
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:33,188
[SPEAKER_14]: It may need some setback variances and not others.

132
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:38,312
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you can have a general answer, but it's — that's all a matter of speculation.

133
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:41,155
[SPEAKER_14]: not certainty.

134
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:44,457
[SPEAKER_14]: So there will be setback variances.

135
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:47,860
[SPEAKER_14]: And others, depending upon where the house was situated.

136
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:58,369
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just like to move also that we maybe get our arborist, our tree warden, to draft a report for us.

137
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:03,193
[SPEAKER_09]: Go down, take a look, draft her own report, and get it to the council with regards to

138
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:08,932
[SPEAKER_09]: what type of damage would be done if they had to cut through the roots and try to save the tree, and if that's applicable.

139
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:18,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if our tree warden has the right to go on private property and examine a tree that belongs to a private resident.

140
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:21,136
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't know if this matters a matter for the city council.

141
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:22,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just to answer the question.

142
00:13:22,857 --> 00:13:23,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

143
00:13:23,477 --> 00:13:28,039
[SPEAKER_10]: I have many, many citizens who are trying to get answers from me, one city councilor.

144
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:30,100
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's definitely pertinent and relevant.

145
00:13:31,384 --> 00:13:41,650
[SPEAKER_14]: The direct answer to the question is that the tree wooden does not have the right to go on to private property to do testing of the tree roots or anything else without the agreement of the owner.

146
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:55,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I understand the sentiments behind it, and the response to that is that private property is something that we just can't enter onto, even if we have the best of public intentions, because this is still America.

147
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't you think she could examine the property from the sidewalk?

148
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:00,425
[SPEAKER_14]: not the roots.

149
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:04,266
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's the, that's the rub chair.

150
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:08,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just ask, um, put, put a motion forth that the council be given that copy of the report.

151
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:15,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, jumbo server requested a copy of the Albert risk report from Mr. From the developer.

152
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:21,010
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the city of Medford gets that report, if it could be forwarded to the city council, we'll certainly share that.

153
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,751
[SPEAKER_09]: So move that as a, um, resolve, please.

154
00:14:24,991 --> 00:14:26,592
[SPEAKER_13]: Chair recognizes council.

155
00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:27,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

156
00:14:27,672 --> 00:14:27,752
[SPEAKER_13]: Um,

157
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:33,052
[SPEAKER_13]: When I saw this on the agenda this week, I went by there on Friday and looked at the property.

158
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:36,193
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll tell you, the tree is outstanding.

159
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:38,654
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there's really no other way to put it.

160
00:14:39,154 --> 00:14:44,536
[SPEAKER_13]: And I looked around the property there, and then the guy looks like he's doing an outstanding job of the house doing it over.

161
00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:50,518
[SPEAKER_13]: And by even putting another house there, it compromises the whole look of the whole area.

162
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,579
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be another shame to let another house go there.

163
00:14:55,599 --> 00:14:56,880
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, like you said, I don't know

164
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:05,430
[SPEAKER_13]: our grounds are, but I'll say it compromises the whole look of the whole property and the whole neighborhood by letting that other house go on that spot there.

165
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:11,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Nevermind the curb cuts and added traffic that would be added to that neighborhood.

166
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:12,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

167
00:15:12,655 --> 00:15:14,496
[SPEAKER_14]: The city has no legal options right now.

168
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:18,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

169
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:19,980
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

170
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,304
[SPEAKER_16]: I think some of the initial concern was raised by a resident that

171
00:15:26,849 --> 00:15:35,612
[SPEAKER_16]: went down to the building department and reviewed the building plans and plot plans for that particular piece of property.

172
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:44,874
[SPEAKER_16]: And there was some notes put on the plot plan, I believe it was, that said, this is not a buildable lot.

173
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:46,235
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot cannot be built on.

174
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:47,855
[SPEAKER_16]: And they were handwritten notes.

175
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:50,656
[SPEAKER_16]: I know, if I could just make my point.

176
00:15:51,373 --> 00:16:09,906
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think at the time, and this is going back many years ago, is that someone from the building department went down and looked at it and said, based on this tree, this beech tree that's 125 years old that was probably there before many of the homes in the area, that in his opinion, you couldn't build

177
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:14,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the lot with that tree on it wasn't big enough to put a house.

178
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:24,196
[SPEAKER_16]: But legally, I guess, from what I was told by John Bavuso, is that lot meets every requirement as a buildable lot.

179
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:29,580
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was some of the confusion, because that was the original email I sent out on behalf of the resident.

180
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,521
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's true.

181
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:36,385
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a notation on the assessor's records that was code 0321012, which when you look in the

182
00:16:39,978 --> 00:16:42,460
[SPEAKER_14]: The assessor's guide says unbuildable.

183
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:49,167
[SPEAKER_14]: But that means it would be unbuildable if in its physical condition, if that tree stayed.

184
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:55,493
[SPEAKER_14]: The same type of notation is made on properties that have like a cliff or a wall or things of that nature.

185
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Unbuildable from a physical point of view.

186
00:16:58,375 --> 00:16:59,877
[SPEAKER_14]: What makes it buildable would be

187
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,751
[SPEAKER_14]: if the tree was taken down.

188
00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:17,341
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the residents in the area had raised that issue at various times over the course of the last couple of months, and today I asked Mr. O'Neill, Ed O'Neill, our chief assessor, to come to my office at 10 o'clock, and we had this, oh, Jesus.

189
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,701
[SPEAKER_14]: It's all right.

190
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:34,122
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he's okay.

191
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:36,585
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, we had this resident call.

192
00:17:36,685 --> 00:17:40,149
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I asked her for a telephone number and we had her on a conference call today.

193
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,173
[SPEAKER_14]: So we explained those notations and what they meant.

194
00:17:43,693 --> 00:17:46,476
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was confusing to a lot of people, including myself.

195
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:49,640
[SPEAKER_14]: But Mr. O'Neill showed how that meant physically.

196
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:52,790
[SPEAKER_14]: You could not build on it if that tree were to stay.

197
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,831
[SPEAKER_14]: But legally, if the tree is gone, you could build.

198
00:17:56,352 --> 00:18:01,235
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is a matter of tax valuation as opposed to zoning.

199
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:12,101
[SPEAKER_14]: That particular code of unbuildable was meant for the valuation of that property from an assessor's point of view, not the buildable part of it from a zoning point of view.

200
00:18:12,982 --> 00:18:13,922
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was confusing.

201
00:18:13,962 --> 00:18:14,323
[SPEAKER_14]: You're right.

202
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:18,105
[SPEAKER_16]: And just the other point I have, Mr. President, is that

203
00:18:19,602 --> 00:18:25,467
[SPEAKER_16]: In addition to the tree, which I agree, I mean, that tree makes up the very fabric of that neighborhood.

204
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:29,070
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like the tree, the magnificent tree across from St.

205
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,113
[SPEAKER_16]: Joseph's School that's been on that front lawn for 150 years.

206
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:38,118
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't know what the type of tree it is, but it's a beautiful, the leaves come out purple.

207
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:39,399
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a beautiful tree.

208
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,480
[SPEAKER_16]: It's on private property.

209
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:54,732
[SPEAKER_16]: I could see why neighbors would get upset, but I think some of the concern I have also is with, I went by the other day and I noticed the curb cuts on Metcalf.

210
00:18:55,633 --> 00:19:04,602
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm under the impression that if there is another house built at the corner, that they're going to be petitioning for curb cuts on Walnut.

211
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:07,337
[SPEAKER_14]: That may well be true, but I don't know about that.

212
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,677
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what I'm under the impression.

213
00:19:08,737 --> 00:19:14,059
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, you know, I think this is some of the concern, uh, it's tight neighborhood to park already.

214
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:24,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, as everyone is aware of and anytime you take, even if it's just a few spots of parking, especially in Metcalfe, it makes a big difference to the neighborhood.

215
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:28,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Although he did put a number of, uh, surface slots on his own property.

216
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:32,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, there still is a concern in the area, but, um,

217
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:42,189
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure what can be done for the tree itself, not to make light of it, but I've seen some unique shows on A&E where they make beautiful tree houses.

218
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:54,792
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was thinking maybe if we could make a combination house with the tree somehow, maybe be the centerpiece when you walk in, something to that effect that we may be able to come to a compromise.

219
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:58,954
[SPEAKER_14]: That certainly is beyond my capability, but it's interesting.

220
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:00,654
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought so.

221
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:00,934
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

222
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:02,842
[SPEAKER_11]: She recognized council Falco.

223
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:03,902
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

224
00:20:04,183 --> 00:20:10,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I did drive by the property and the, the, the tree is beautiful and it'd be really sad to see the tree go.

225
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:23,674
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but I'm just curious as far as, and I'm not sure if the, through you to, uh, the city sales solicitor to, uh, to a counselor, uh, Lungo, um, does anyone know the square footage of the lot that the tree is on?

226
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:26,635
[SPEAKER_14]: I have that in a file in my office.

227
00:20:26,695 --> 00:20:27,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, it is.

228
00:20:27,596 --> 00:20:29,337
[SPEAKER_14]: It is sufficient for buildable purposes.

229
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:29,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

230
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:33,211
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have the exact amount on top of my head.

231
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:39,899
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just curious, because I think the lot was originally split, is that what happened?

232
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:40,299
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

233
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:44,764
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know.

234
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:45,886
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'll certainly get you that.

235
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:46,967
[SPEAKER_14]: If you could, that'd be great.

236
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:47,668
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

237
00:20:47,688 --> 00:20:48,949
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilman Knight.

238
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:49,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Send that out tomorrow.

239
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:50,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

240
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:54,876
[SPEAKER_05]: An interesting situation happened down in Duxbury that was very similar to this.

241
00:20:55,297 --> 00:21:01,620
[SPEAKER_05]: A gentleman bought a parcel of land, and in the backyard of this parcel was a very old tree.

242
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,782
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was a bunch of community outcry to save the tree.

243
00:21:05,822 --> 00:21:11,224
[SPEAKER_05]: And the gentleman had spent close to a million dollars on buying a piece of land that was waterfront property, and he didn't want to save the tree.

244
00:21:11,244 --> 00:21:12,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was his land, and he didn't want to save it.

245
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:14,056
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was all well and good.

246
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:20,300
[SPEAKER_05]: And what happened was the community and the property owner got together and they sat down and they devised a plan to move the tree.

247
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:32,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So if, in fact, the property owner has intentions of taking the tree down, Mr. President, I'm wondering if our tree warden would be willing to take a look at it and maybe give the council an estimate with how much it would cost to actually move the tree.

248
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:40,993
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure if the property owner is going to be cutting the tree down, he'd be just as willing to donate it to the city if the city would be willing to remove the tree and plant it elsewhere.

249
00:21:42,453 --> 00:21:43,813
[SPEAKER_05]: It's huge, it's absolutely huge.

250
00:21:43,993 --> 00:21:45,994
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's gigantic, there's no question about it.

251
00:21:46,094 --> 00:21:49,455
[SPEAKER_05]: And the tree in Duxbury was gigantic as well, but they were able to move it.

252
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:56,737
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I raised the issue as to what she thinks the cost might be associated with that, if they'd be able to move the tree as opposed to cutting it down if it came to that circumstance, Mr. President.

253
00:21:57,097 --> 00:21:58,858
[SPEAKER_06]: As further amended by Councilor Knight.

254
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Gentleman at the podium, please state your name and address for the record.

255
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:04,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Nick Tomazook, 29 Garfield Avenue.

256
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,620
[SPEAKER_12]: I just have one question.

257
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Were the taxes on this property paid as an unbuildable lot or a buildable lot?

258
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:13,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Because there's a difference in tax rates.

259
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:15,156
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

260
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:25,782
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Langel-Kern as amended and by she and Councilor Knight, Mr. Councilor Motz.

261
00:22:26,382 --> 00:22:37,088
[SPEAKER_16]: Just if I could, Mr. President, um, many people may not be aware, but, uh, our building commission has been out with, uh, um, surgery, uh, and, uh, hope he recovers quickly.

262
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:41,710
[SPEAKER_16]: And I personally would like to thank, uh, solicitor Romley.

263
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:48,942
[SPEAKER_16]: because he stepped up to the plate on a number of issues to address things that maybe are out of his purview.

264
00:22:49,722 --> 00:22:56,425
[SPEAKER_16]: And he's done a great job, and I know this is one of them that he stepped up to assist the residents.

265
00:22:56,846 --> 00:23:00,327
[SPEAKER_16]: It may not be the answer the residents wanted, but at least they got some answers.

266
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:03,268
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just want to personally thank Solicitor Rumley.

267
00:23:03,569 --> 00:23:06,730
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot to be grateful to Attorney Rumley for.

268
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,031
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion for approval as amended.

269
00:23:09,071 --> 00:23:09,791
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

270
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:10,432
Aye.

271
00:23:10,492 --> 00:23:10,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

272
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:15,543
[SPEAKER_06]: 16-430 offered by vice-president Longo Kern.

273
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:24,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the current issues surrounding Craddock bridge construction be discussed and that a concerned business owner be allowed to address the council.

274
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam vice-president.

275
00:23:25,924 --> 00:23:26,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

276
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:27,425
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm president Delaware.

277
00:23:27,445 --> 00:23:40,367
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was brought to my attention, um, that today specifically, there was a lot of jackhammering going on, um, with regards to the Craddock bridge, but the vibration detector was for some reason removed today.

278
00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:43,013
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the first thing I want to bring up.

279
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:49,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I had brought that up to the engineer's attention, and it seemed to her like it was movable.

280
00:23:49,516 --> 00:23:55,880
[SPEAKER_09]: But for some reason, this noise detection machine is at the same place, same time, every day, all day.

281
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:04,424
[SPEAKER_09]: And for some reason today, they're jackhammering, the building's vibrating, the bridge is vibrating, and that detection machine was gone.

282
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:09,667
[SPEAKER_09]: So I did reach out to the MassDOT, and I reached out to the

283
00:24:10,724 --> 00:24:13,826
[SPEAKER_09]: city engineer and to me it doesn't look good.

284
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:23,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Obviously I don't think that it's safe to remove a vibration detector, noise detector from somewhere where they're doing major work.

285
00:24:24,974 --> 00:24:34,440
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to get an update from MassDOT with regards to why it was removed and see if there's any way we can

286
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:45,010
[SPEAKER_09]: this Mastod can make this a permanent detection system, so it's never moved, and there's no question out there as to if and why such a machine was moved.

287
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,751
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my first issue.

288
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:49,412
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the second issue — The Press.

289
00:24:49,432 --> 00:24:53,974
[SPEAKER_06]: If I could, Madam Vice President, just point out that that was a precondition to this entire project.

290
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:54,834
[SPEAKER_09]: The Vice President.

291
00:24:54,854 --> 00:24:55,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

292
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,575
[SPEAKER_09]: It's — for some reason, it's movable.

293
00:24:56,635 --> 00:24:58,436
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's always been in the same location.

294
00:24:58,996 --> 00:25:04,779
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I drove by today, and from what I've heard from another — from a business owner,

295
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:07,808
[SPEAKER_09]: This machine was not where it always is.

296
00:25:08,928 --> 00:25:16,773
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was quite a bit of activity on the property today, so it makes you question why this detector was moved.

297
00:25:17,373 --> 00:25:25,838
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd just like to see if MassDOT would agree to make it something permanent, something stable so it's unable to be moved.

298
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:31,041
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that would clear up a lot of concerns of the business district.

299
00:25:33,536 --> 00:25:41,158
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, got complaints with regards to the cleanliness of the property, windows never being cleaned, businesses almost looking filthy.

300
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:50,339
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that deters from residents frequenting our constituents, consumers frequenting our businesses.

301
00:25:50,459 --> 00:26:03,122
[SPEAKER_09]: So my second request to MassDOT is that maybe we do a clean, if the windows can be power washed on the surrounding, you know, on the few surrounding businesses, maybe at the end of every week.

302
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:14,512
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a good recommendation and something that will make the area look a little neater for when the weekend, when we shut down for the weekend and some of the businesses are still open.

303
00:26:17,655 --> 00:26:29,104
[SPEAKER_09]: Also have just, if we could get an update with regards to the parking, there was parking spots that were implemented and I know there's a committee, our committee, George Councilor Scarpelli

304
00:26:30,185 --> 00:26:38,369
[SPEAKER_09]: And that committee is working on, with regards to the bus stop, I know I've gotten complaints with regards to buses kind of swinging into the street and it being unsafe.

305
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:40,510
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know that committee's working on that.

306
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:46,112
[SPEAKER_09]: But also the parking spaces that were at the location, they were there temporarily and now they're gone.

307
00:26:46,232 --> 00:26:57,397
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the council can get an update with regards to why the three parking spaces were implemented and then removed from the front of the business, that would be helpful.

308
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:00,126
[SPEAKER_09]: And lastly, it came to my attention today.

309
00:27:00,226 --> 00:27:09,472
[SPEAKER_09]: Thankfully, our engineer responded to my email, but it looks like we do have a point person to the project that I was unaware of.

310
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:17,456
[SPEAKER_09]: So the city did put somebody as point, but as far as I know, the first I heard of it was today.

311
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:22,279
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure when this person was represented as the point person.

312
00:27:22,339 --> 00:27:25,261
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that the council requested, and I'm glad that it's being done.

313
00:27:25,341 --> 00:27:26,662
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as I know,

314
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:54,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if that point person has been out there, so maybe if we can just get some clarification on what the point person's duties, from the city engineer's office, what that person's duties are, if that person's gonna be going out to local businesses to discuss the needs and concerns on maybe a weekly basis, like we recommended, to have a point person that hasn't done anything, and I think it's been a few weeks since that person's been appointed point person.

315
00:27:58,085 --> 00:27:58,806
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have the name.

316
00:27:58,826 --> 00:28:01,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the name, but I am.

317
00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:03,309
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

318
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,231
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's a female.

319
00:28:10,075 --> 00:28:11,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Penny, what's the last name?

320
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Penny A, yes, has been point person.

321
00:28:18,422 --> 00:28:27,549
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we can just get an update with regards to contact information, phone number, email, so we can get that to businesses so that we have it in case we have questions.

322
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:35,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Today I first reached out to MassDOT when I had concerns, and I would have first, you know, reached out to the city of Medford to maybe do that for me.

323
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:38,136
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's important for the council to have.

324
00:28:38,156 --> 00:28:41,919
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's important for the businesses, all the Medford Square businesses to have.

325
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,622
[SPEAKER_09]: And for some reason, you know, nobody's really seen anybody down there.

326
00:28:45,662 --> 00:28:48,844
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's something that the council has asked for repeatedly.

327
00:28:48,864 --> 00:28:56,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very happy somebody's appointed, but obviously we need to just know what that is going to entail and how that person's going to help.

328
00:28:57,442 --> 00:29:01,024
[SPEAKER_09]: with our concerns, the residents' concerns, and the businesses' concerns.

329
00:29:01,404 --> 00:29:07,966
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of Vice President Lago-Kern, as amended four times, I think a citizen would like to address us.

330
00:29:09,387 --> 00:29:09,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

331
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:11,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

332
00:29:11,788 --> 00:29:12,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome.

333
00:29:12,308 --> 00:29:14,849
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Maury Carroll, 31 Richard Street, Medford.

334
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:18,150
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also the owner of Carroll's Restaurant in Medford Square.

335
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,892
[SPEAKER_15]: At this point, the most direct about it to the project going on.

336
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:27,967
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd just like to follow up what Councilor Kern had to say.

337
00:29:29,348 --> 00:29:39,116
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, my building is painted black on the outside, and I have brown awnings with white lettering on those awnings.

338
00:29:39,936 --> 00:29:44,900
[SPEAKER_15]: If anybody takes a ride by, it's a nice concrete gray dust color at this point.

339
00:29:45,821 --> 00:29:54,067
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't believe it's within our realm as an operator that I should be cleaning up after MassDOT and the construction and the contracting going on.

340
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:01,557
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice to hear that we have a liaison that I think was appointed back in February.

341
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:02,598
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not entirely sure.

342
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:17,893
[SPEAKER_15]: But to have no one show up or be recognized or introduce themselves certainly says a lot about where the interests of maybe the residents of this building, where they're at as far as the construction project that's going on.

343
00:30:20,076 --> 00:30:32,863
[SPEAKER_15]: It should be embarrassed as far as I'm concerned that someone's been appointed since February and not has once knocked on the door, given a phone number, or even made a phone call if they're so busy they can't make a trip down to the square.

344
00:30:36,745 --> 00:30:38,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Today's vibrations, they've had a

345
00:30:39,592 --> 00:30:41,713
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess they call it a DB sensor machine.

346
00:30:41,813 --> 00:30:46,254
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got a microphone, a data recorder, and it records the sounds and the vibrations.

347
00:30:46,274 --> 00:30:49,435
[SPEAKER_15]: They do have vibration sensors attached to the building.

348
00:30:50,415 --> 00:31:04,900
[SPEAKER_15]: But for some reason today, with the excavator virtually leaning on the building today and pounding away, with bottles rattling, glassware rattling, if you sit anywhere, you can feel the vibration of the building.

349
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Miraculously, it disappeared.

350
00:31:07,422 --> 00:31:11,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, maybe it can't be out there in the rain today, but it could be out there in the rain last week.

351
00:31:13,424 --> 00:31:18,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, I'm not entirely sure how this vanished overnight with the excavator leaving on the building.

352
00:31:18,925 --> 00:31:22,906
[SPEAKER_15]: It's probably just a coincidence, but I don't think so.

353
00:31:25,646 --> 00:31:27,927
[SPEAKER_15]: We just need your help down there.

354
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:30,127
[SPEAKER_15]: We had 24 hours of parking.

355
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:34,468
[SPEAKER_15]: It lasted 24 hours that the traffic commission approved.

356
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:41,449
[SPEAKER_15]: And one of the other divisions, I think it was the team, got upset.

357
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:42,629
[SPEAKER_15]: They weren't notified.

358
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Signs are gone.

359
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,691
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no consideration to the operators going on down there in this project.

360
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:51,472
[SPEAKER_15]: They take no prisoners.

361
00:31:53,092 --> 00:31:54,952
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm becoming a president.

362
00:31:56,393 --> 00:31:59,433
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's really tough to do business down there right now.

363
00:32:00,154 --> 00:32:06,095
[SPEAKER_15]: So any help, any recommendations, any way we can open the lines of communication,

364
00:32:06,987 --> 00:32:08,208
[SPEAKER_15]: was at the mayor's office.

365
00:32:09,109 --> 00:32:10,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor came down one day.

366
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,771
[SPEAKER_15]: It was just before the Committee of the Whole meeting.

367
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:15,933
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never heard a word or a phone call or follow-up since.

368
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:26,521
[SPEAKER_15]: We asked for signage at that Committee of the Whole meeting back in January, and they assured us that we were going to receive all kinds of new signage and directions on how to get to the different businesses.

369
00:32:27,021 --> 00:32:27,702
[SPEAKER_15]: It's still the same.

370
00:32:27,722 --> 00:32:32,865
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I know they don't move that quick, January to the end of April.

371
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:34,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe I'm asking for too much.

372
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:39,412
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's not pretty what's going on down there.

373
00:32:39,432 --> 00:32:41,513
[SPEAKER_15]: So, again, whatever you can do, thank you for your time.

374
00:32:41,873 --> 00:32:42,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Certainly appreciate it.

375
00:32:42,933 --> 00:32:44,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Carroll, you have full support.

376
00:32:45,635 --> 00:32:47,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Vice President Mungo Kern.

377
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:49,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

378
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:55,899
[SPEAKER_09]: I, too, remember we voted to ask MassDOT to put some extra signage in and they said they'd do it.

379
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,782
[SPEAKER_09]: But can you refresh my recollection exactly so that we can maybe ask them again tonight what

380
00:33:02,422 --> 00:33:17,387
[SPEAKER_15]: They were just going to put more signage that the businesses are open, the restaurant is open, the real estate office, the insurance company, just try to make it more visible down there because you can tell it's locked in pretty well.

381
00:33:18,628 --> 00:33:19,588
[SPEAKER_09]: If we can add that to...

382
00:33:21,077 --> 00:33:23,699
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, this has absolutely shut down my complete day business.

383
00:33:25,081 --> 00:33:27,883
[SPEAKER_15]: Fred, as you all know, we did a lot of after-funeral business and everything.

384
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:31,886
[SPEAKER_15]: No one was coming down there with that banging and that sort of stuff.

385
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:41,655
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it just keeps biting away every month now at different revenue centers that we have built into the operation.

386
00:33:43,536 --> 00:33:43,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

387
00:33:44,517 --> 00:33:45,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

388
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:49,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Lungelkorn, as amended by Vice President Lungelkorn.

389
00:33:49,955 --> 00:33:52,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

390
00:33:52,857 --> 00:33:53,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

391
00:33:54,318 --> 00:34:02,863
[SPEAKER_02]: To Mr. Carroll, I know that in the view in public, we will be having a subcommittee that is planned for May 3rd.

392
00:34:04,004 --> 00:34:12,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the Department of Transportation can only do meetings before a certain time, which is funny.

393
00:34:16,225 --> 00:34:19,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Representative Donato really did a great job really pushing them along.

394
00:34:19,968 --> 00:34:26,152
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been too long, and we hope to have a resolution on May 3rd and move some things forward.

395
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:43,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been by that site every morning, taking a few hundred pictures, and one of the things we're noticing is the buses that aren't even coming close to the curb and sticking out into High Street because of the construction work, which is a very dangerous situation.

396
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:49,708
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that we'll be discussing with the Department of Transportation on the 3rd.

397
00:34:49,768 --> 00:34:52,853
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, sorry you have to go through this.

398
00:34:54,615 --> 00:34:55,316
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilman Miles.

399
00:34:56,377 --> 00:34:57,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

400
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,165
[SPEAKER_16]: I remember when DOT was before us and one of the questions that was asked

401
00:35:02,742 --> 00:35:04,683
[SPEAKER_16]: regarding construction equipment.

402
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:11,087
[SPEAKER_16]: We had concern that equipment would be moved off the roadway during certain hours of non-work.

403
00:35:11,847 --> 00:35:16,990
[SPEAKER_16]: But one of the questions that was asked was about power washing of buildings and windows in the area.

404
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,692
[SPEAKER_16]: To date, Mari, have you seen any power washing?

405
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:21,593
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you may.

406
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,136
[SPEAKER_16]: So that was one day that they cleaned windows?

407
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:30,658
[SPEAKER_16]: And the construction's been going on for,

408
00:35:34,995 --> 00:35:35,696
[SPEAKER_16]: since October.

409
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:41,921
[SPEAKER_16]: So, Mr. President, as part of whatever recommendations, and I agree with the signage, that's important.

410
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:49,668
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we have to note, Mr. President, that when DOT came in, I think the city really could have played hardball at the time.

411
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:54,252
[SPEAKER_16]: This was a huge disruption to traffic flow, to businesses,

412
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:57,815
[SPEAKER_16]: to residents, to people catching the bus, you name it.

413
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:01,496
[SPEAKER_16]: And we allowed a temporary bridge to cross private property.

414
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:09,958
[SPEAKER_16]: We allowed them to put up barriers in front of well-established businesses, crippling these businesses in the area.

415
00:36:11,018 --> 00:36:13,999
[SPEAKER_16]: No one, to be quite honest with you, wants to walk down by that area.

416
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:17,840
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can see how this is going to have an impact.

417
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,060
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wish I could tell you it's going to end soon.

418
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,561
[SPEAKER_16]: And as you know, it's going to be for

419
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:26,270
[SPEAKER_16]: a while out there.

420
00:36:27,211 --> 00:36:38,674
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that I know when we ask them to come before us, they come and they don't really give us any answers, or they years us to death.

421
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:42,375
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I'm not sure what the next step is.

422
00:36:42,675 --> 00:36:47,716
[SPEAKER_16]: This council a while back recommended that we halt the project.

423
00:36:49,301 --> 00:36:59,488
[SPEAKER_16]: and have the building commissioner go out there and put a cease and desist in that particular area until we get hard fact answers on some of the concerns that are being raised.

424
00:37:00,149 --> 00:37:09,856
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the time, I thought it was a great suggestion, but I'm not sure if the city has the stomach to do that, Mr. President.

425
00:37:10,257 --> 00:37:16,942
[SPEAKER_16]: But I can tell you, if I was in the corner office, that would be the first thing I'd do on behalf of the business owners and the residents of this community.

426
00:37:17,541 --> 00:37:22,664
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not to stop progress, and it's not to stop the Craddock Bridge, which we all know needs to be done.

427
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:26,446
[SPEAKER_16]: It's to make sure that we're looking out for the interest of our community.

428
00:37:26,946 --> 00:37:28,007
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't see that happening.

429
00:37:28,587 --> 00:37:29,147
[SPEAKER_16]: I really don't.

430
00:37:29,187 --> 00:37:35,551
[SPEAKER_16]: You can appoint all the point people you want, but I don't see any of the major issues being followed through.

431
00:37:36,491 --> 00:37:37,832
[SPEAKER_16]: And lastly, Mr. President,

432
00:37:38,247 --> 00:37:47,935
[SPEAKER_16]: When they did the Fast 14 project out here through the square, one of the largest building projects, highway building projects in bridge repair in this state's history.

433
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,957
[SPEAKER_16]: It happened over several months.

434
00:37:50,997 --> 00:37:52,379
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a minor disruption.

435
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:59,024
[SPEAKER_16]: And the contractor, which was hired by the state, paid mitigation money to the city.

436
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:01,348
[SPEAKER_16]: and we repaved Hormel Stadium.

437
00:38:01,788 --> 00:38:03,830
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we bought some new police cruises.

438
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:06,472
[SPEAKER_16]: We did a number of things with that mitigation money.

439
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:13,918
[SPEAKER_16]: They had a senior picnic because the seniors had to listen to the disruption and so forth.

440
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:20,204
[SPEAKER_16]: And now we have a gentleman that's practically, you already told us, he lost his afternoon business.

441
00:38:20,744 --> 00:38:27,390
[SPEAKER_16]: He's being practically put out of business and the state will not discuss, the state said we do not pay mitigation.

442
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:41,989
[SPEAKER_16]: When they did the big project 93, they paid all those particular businesses, Techie and all the businesses going along 93 when they did the big dig.

443
00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:48,833
[SPEAKER_16]: They all got mitigation money and they looked at their records and saw that the business went down during this particular period of time.

444
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:52,416
[SPEAKER_16]: And they paid the business owners, and rightfully so, Mr. President.

445
00:38:52,816 --> 00:39:00,820
[SPEAKER_16]: And here we have a business owner in the city that the state won't even entertain it, saying they don't pay mitigation.

446
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:05,902
[SPEAKER_16]: I just find that difficult to swallow, Mr. President.

447
00:39:05,982 --> 00:39:10,823
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, we're not against progress, but we're against local businesses.

448
00:39:11,664 --> 00:39:13,404
[SPEAKER_16]: It's tough enough in the square to make business.

449
00:39:14,565 --> 00:39:17,186
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you have a project like this and hurting

450
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:19,917
[SPEAKER_16]: these local people that are really trying to stick it out.

451
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:21,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Right?

452
00:39:21,438 --> 00:39:22,819
[SPEAKER_16]: But, Mara, you're trying to stick it out there.

453
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:25,360
[SPEAKER_16]: You're trying to — it's a matter of day to day.

454
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:28,222
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a matter of day to day for these businesses.

455
00:39:28,302 --> 00:39:33,485
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I'm really at wit's end with this, Mr. President.

456
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:43,911
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can't imagine having a business for two and a half to three years put up with this type of debris, dirt, construction, barriers, and you name it, every day.

457
00:39:44,551 --> 00:39:45,212
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't imagine.

458
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:55,176
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we have to ask again, and it was unanimous vote last time, unanimous vote by this council for a cease and desist.

459
00:39:55,216 --> 00:40:02,560
[SPEAKER_16]: But if councils aren't ready to vote on that, or if they'd rather discuss this with the administration, I think we should discuss it with the mayor first.

460
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,483
[SPEAKER_16]: The mayor has a lot of leverage with different state departments, in particular DOT.

461
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:13,066
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think we should call for a meeting with the mayor, Mr. President, to discuss this issue.

462
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:15,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

463
00:40:15,672 --> 00:40:18,575
[SPEAKER_16]: So I look for your leadership, Mr. President, to set something up.

464
00:40:19,195 --> 00:40:20,036
[SPEAKER_06]: We will work on that.

465
00:40:20,857 --> 00:40:22,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councillor Knight.

466
00:40:22,558 --> 00:40:23,899
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

467
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,144
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mr. Carroll, we had a long conversation last week about this topic, and it's something that I'm well aware of.

468
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:34,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And I apologize on behalf of the city and the state for what you have to go through.

469
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:36,029
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope that

470
00:40:36,922 --> 00:40:41,124
[SPEAKER_05]: You and your family are able to fare the storms until we can get some sort of resolve here for you.

471
00:40:41,925 --> 00:40:43,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper.

472
00:40:43,606 --> 00:40:52,371
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to ask that our city point person from the engineering department report to the council what steps have been taken to ensure the accountability of the contractors.

473
00:40:54,312 --> 00:40:54,953
[SPEAKER_06]: What steps?

474
00:40:55,373 --> 00:41:00,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the point person has taken.

475
00:41:00,787 --> 00:41:09,274
[SPEAKER_05]: In compliance with the mitigation efforts, Mr. President, that they've come up here and sold us like snake oil on several different occasions, I think it's important that the city holds them accountable.

476
00:41:09,354 --> 00:41:12,717
[SPEAKER_05]: If they come up here and say they're going to do something and then don't do it, who's watching the house?

477
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's making sure they're doing what they're supposed to do?

478
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:26,649
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd also like to ask the question as to what outreach efforts have been conducted by the city point person between the business community, the administration, and the contractor to ensure that we don't have to keep running into these same problems?

479
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:44,129
[SPEAKER_06]: to reach out to the aggrieved business owners, the local community, and to communicate those sentiments to the administration and the various department heads.

480
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:50,192
[SPEAKER_05]: And because I think, Mr. President, it's one thing for us to keep asking for some action.

481
00:41:50,629 --> 00:42:16,411
[SPEAKER_05]: but there should be some sort of record or documentation of what's being done, what phone calls are being made, whether they're in non-compliance, whether they're in compliance, whether or not, you know, the simple and small items that will affect the quality of life that are really not very costly are being done so that we can all live together and get along and get this project over with without impeding construction but also allowing the businesses to be successful.

482
00:42:17,723 --> 00:42:18,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Also care for you.

483
00:42:18,623 --> 00:42:18,844
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

484
00:42:18,864 --> 00:42:19,324
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

485
00:42:19,484 --> 00:42:22,485
[SPEAKER_13]: I think council Marcus is a, is a 100% correct.

486
00:42:22,605 --> 00:42:28,508
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, they can send it to the mayor, get involved this project now and, uh, and give us a, all a little bit of help here.

487
00:42:29,028 --> 00:42:47,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I'll also ask that, um, council Scott Pelley, if council Scott Pelley will add the, uh, our city point person to our meeting, uh, on the third, um, to come with us when, when we're all did, uh, doing, uh, the work with the T would be helpful too.

488
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:57,627
[SPEAKER_13]: And also that point person come here next week along with the point person from Zoppo to answer questions that we have.

489
00:42:58,467 --> 00:42:59,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

490
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,807
[SPEAKER_06]: As further amended.

491
00:43:01,887 --> 00:43:07,909
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the main motion as amended by councillors Lungelkorn, Knight, Mox, and Caviello.

492
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:09,269
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor.

493
00:43:09,389 --> 00:43:09,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call.

494
00:43:11,849 --> 00:43:13,309
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call vote has been requested.

495
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:15,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please if you would call the roll.

496
00:43:16,824 --> 00:43:19,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to sever, Mr. Koslow?

497
00:43:20,205 --> 00:43:20,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Sever?

498
00:43:20,565 --> 00:43:26,146
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know much about anti-vibration devices and whether or not there should be people who would not move Mr. President.

499
00:43:26,446 --> 00:43:31,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not comfortable at this point in time telling Mr. Nixon to screen or not.

500
00:43:32,607 --> 00:43:41,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the, we will sever out the anti-vibration part of this and take that vote first.

501
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:43,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So on that.

502
00:43:45,223 --> 00:43:45,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Amendment.

503
00:43:46,163 --> 00:43:47,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call.

504
00:43:47,284 --> 00:43:52,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Could you, could you read that amendment, Mr. President that we're voting on?

505
00:43:52,425 --> 00:44:04,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that the, uh, city, uh, that the, uh, mass dot, uh, report back to the city council and re on why they've moved or if they have moved the vibration detectors.

506
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:05,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

507
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,491
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, for what reason it may or may not have been moved.

508
00:44:16,405 --> 00:44:24,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's any person in this room right now who has the technical wherewithal to make that decision, Mr. Counselor.

509
00:44:27,015 --> 00:44:27,535
[SPEAKER_06]: You wish to?

510
00:44:28,576 --> 00:44:30,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a quick point on that, just so we're all clear.

511
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:35,262
[SPEAKER_15]: I did speak to Mike Wittig, who is the DOT's

512
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,871
[SPEAKER_15]: point person for this project.

513
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:46,496
[SPEAKER_15]: When, uh, I called him regarding the sensor or whatever it is missing.

514
00:44:46,556 --> 00:44:49,818
[SPEAKER_15]: He says it's supposed to be there for the entire duration of the job.

515
00:44:50,538 --> 00:44:51,499
[SPEAKER_15]: If that helps at all.

516
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,282
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a precondition to the whole project.

517
00:44:57,202 --> 00:44:59,404
[SPEAKER_06]: And we entertain that from the beginning.

518
00:44:59,924 --> 00:45:04,567
[SPEAKER_07]: So on that, on that withdraw the motion.

519
00:45:04,607 --> 00:45:06,148
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mr. Clerk, take the, uh,

520
00:45:06,908 --> 00:45:14,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the roll, please, on the main motion, which was offered under suspension by Vice President Lago-Curran, and amended.

521
00:45:15,274 --> 00:45:16,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caviello?

522
00:45:16,095 --> 00:45:16,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

523
00:45:17,016 --> 00:45:17,736
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Felco?

524
00:45:17,816 --> 00:45:17,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

525
00:45:18,317 --> 00:45:18,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

526
00:45:18,857 --> 00:45:19,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

527
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:20,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Lago-Curran?

528
00:45:20,738 --> 00:45:20,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

529
00:45:21,299 --> 00:45:21,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Mox?

530
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:22,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

531
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:23,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Scarpelli?

532
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

533
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:24,821
[SPEAKER_07]: President Del Rosso?

534
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:25,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

535
00:45:25,242 --> 00:45:28,604
[SPEAKER_06]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, the motion passes unanimously.

536
00:45:29,585 --> 00:45:30,586
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Vice President.

537
00:45:34,574 --> 00:45:40,196
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're under suspension if we could just let a resident speak to make an announcement about a community event.

538
00:45:41,817 --> 00:45:42,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

539
00:45:45,378 --> 00:45:47,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Please state your name and address for the record.

540
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:50,560
[SPEAKER_00]: Shara Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

541
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,161
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here on behalf of the students of the Roberts Elementary School.

542
00:45:55,982 --> 00:45:59,343
[SPEAKER_00]: We have received a grant from the Massachusetts Cultural Council to

543
00:46:00,419 --> 00:46:01,940
[SPEAKER_00]: place a mural in our school.

544
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:08,842

545
00:46:08,962 --> 00:46:13,264
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be unveiling it at our second art night on May 26.

546
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:20,227
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to formally invite the council and anyone in the Roberts community to attend.

00:48:23,886 --> 00:48:25,087

575
00:48:25,367 --> 00:48:25,947

583
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:46,189

00:48:46,229 --> 00:48:49,310
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, we declare that portion of the meeting to close.

585
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:56,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello, Chairman of the Licensing Subcommittee, for commentary.

586
00:48:56,554 --> 00:48:57,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

587
00:48:57,474 --> 00:49:12,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I have reviewed the company's paperwork, and it appears to be in order, and I know this business was located in Boston now for many years, and due to the TEEP construction project, they'll be relocating down to

588
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:18,303
[SPEAKER_13]: Riverside Avenue, and we're happy to have them continue to do business in our community and not move to somewhere else.

589
00:49:18,703 --> 00:49:20,164
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have anything to share with us?

590
00:49:20,865 --> 00:49:22,226
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anything other than that.

591
00:49:22,426 --> 00:49:24,807
[SPEAKER_01]: They are moving their business because they've been dislocated.

592
00:49:24,827 --> 00:49:29,551
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been in business in Medford for 15 years, and it was important for them to stay in Medford.

593
00:49:30,071 --> 00:49:31,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good, and we're grateful to you for doing that.

594
00:49:31,973 --> 00:49:32,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

595
00:49:33,954 --> 00:49:36,056
[SPEAKER_16]: What are your anticipated hours of operation?

596
00:49:36,296 --> 00:49:37,777
[SPEAKER_16]: I know what they say on the paper.

597
00:49:37,957 --> 00:49:40,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, the hours will be 7 to 7, Monday through Friday.

598
00:49:40,989 --> 00:49:43,751
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, with customers, it will be from 8 to 5.

599
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:50,236
[SPEAKER_01]: They anticipate having time to set up in the morning between 7, 7.30, quarter of 8, open at 8.

600
00:49:51,437 --> 00:49:58,722
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically, in this business, those hours run until 5, because rental car services are only open until 6.

601
00:49:59,362 --> 00:50:03,946
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a wind down at 5 to 6, and then time to clean up.

602
00:50:04,006 --> 00:50:07,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would be operating but at reduced levels from 7 to 8

603
00:50:09,983 --> 00:50:11,864
[SPEAKER_01]: five to seven in the evening.

604
00:50:12,524 --> 00:50:21,387
[SPEAKER_16]: And do you anticipate how many cars can you fit on your exterior lot for parking on the exterior lot?

605
00:50:21,847 --> 00:50:24,808
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently there is on a plan.

606
00:50:25,068 --> 00:50:32,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there is 24, but there's a loading area where you could also park cars because there isn't any loading use.

607
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:37,152
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, roughly, and there's an interior parking as well, 24 to

608
00:50:38,968 --> 00:50:42,472
[SPEAKER_01]: to 30 cars outside, and there's additional space inside, I believe.

609
00:50:43,192 --> 00:50:45,354
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to 14 spaces, I think, is what they counted.

610
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:48,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you ever anticipate using the street to podcast?

611
00:50:49,057 --> 00:50:49,217
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

612
00:50:50,278 --> 00:50:52,380
[SPEAKER_01]: They have also purchased the property.

613
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:56,323
[SPEAKER_01]: This purchase and sale agreement, they are buying the property 391 to 397.

614
00:50:56,644 --> 00:51:04,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I included in the package 11 Linden Street, because both the assessor's office and the building include that in the 391, 97.

615
00:51:06,576 --> 00:51:08,577
[SPEAKER_01]: parcel, which is on your plot plan.

616
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:13,638
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're also purchasing 1315 Linden Street, as well.

617
00:51:13,718 --> 00:51:16,579
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some room for overflow.

618
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:23,921
[SPEAKER_16]: So I know recently there was a driveway put in from Riverside to that back part of the property.

619
00:51:23,941 --> 00:51:27,482
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you anticipate using that as an entrance, also?

620
00:51:27,602 --> 00:51:27,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Or is that?

621
00:51:28,442 --> 00:51:31,023
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't part of our plans at the moment.

622
00:51:31,103 --> 00:51:33,343
[SPEAKER_03]: We've only walked in one parcel just once.

623
00:51:33,363 --> 00:51:35,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would like to just use it for an entrance, if possible.

624
00:51:37,376 --> 00:51:39,877
[SPEAKER_16]: So you'd be using the front entrance and not the riverside.

625
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:41,998
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is your property.

626
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:45,140
[SPEAKER_16]: Also that driveway that's there, that's currently goes all the way.

627
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,761
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't own the property as of yet.

628
00:51:47,801 --> 00:51:55,284
[SPEAKER_01]: It's under purchase and sale agreement, but, but the, the, the plan is to buy three 91, three 97, 11 Linden and 13, 15 London.

629
00:51:55,844 --> 00:51:57,205
[SPEAKER_01]: So that whole block area.

630
00:51:58,085 --> 00:52:01,067
[SPEAKER_16]: And you're moving all your current equipment into that site.

631
00:52:01,307 --> 00:52:01,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

632
00:52:03,128 --> 00:52:03,808
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh,

633
00:52:04,713 --> 00:52:10,256
[SPEAKER_16]: the paint fumes and all that stuff that requires elevated stacks and so forth.

634
00:52:11,677 --> 00:52:14,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, correct.

635
00:52:17,321 --> 00:52:21,003
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a use as a right under the zoning bylaw in the industrial.

636
00:52:23,024 --> 00:52:24,785
[SPEAKER_16]: So who actually governs that?

637
00:52:24,825 --> 00:52:28,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Who actually issues a permit for the painting?

638
00:52:28,888 --> 00:52:29,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that a separate?

639
00:52:30,225 --> 00:52:32,467
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you have to apply with the building department for a permit.

640
00:52:32,487 --> 00:52:35,049
[SPEAKER_16]: So the building department and that has not been done as of yet.

641
00:52:36,129 --> 00:52:39,992
[SPEAKER_01]: There's already one booth, um, spray booth within the property currently.

642
00:52:40,613 --> 00:52:43,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there is a spray booth permitted already on the property.

643
00:52:43,755 --> 00:52:45,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

644
00:52:45,976 --> 00:52:46,457
[SPEAKER_16]: I wish you well.

645
00:52:46,737 --> 00:52:56,864
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition, um, just so I can clarify, they do have Saturday hours as well, uh, from eight to I believe one under the, um, which is on the petition itself.

646
00:52:58,305 --> 00:52:58,646
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

647
00:52:58,806 --> 00:52:59,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

648
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:01,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

649
00:53:02,466 --> 00:53:03,806
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

650
00:53:03,826 --> 00:53:08,728
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to congratulate these gentlemen on choosing Medford once again to be their home.

651
00:53:09,188 --> 00:53:11,729
[SPEAKER_05]: We appreciate you staying in the community.

652
00:53:11,749 --> 00:53:12,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I've reviewed the paperwork.

653
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:14,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I see no problem with it.

654
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:17,771
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I'd move for approval at this point in time, but I thank you for staying in the community.

655
00:53:18,271 --> 00:53:20,792
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a motion for approval on the floor from Councilor Caviello.

656
00:53:20,812 --> 00:53:22,153
[SPEAKER_06]: So we second that by Councilor Knight.

657
00:53:22,193 --> 00:53:22,933
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

658
00:53:23,293 --> 00:53:23,933
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

659
00:53:24,293 --> 00:53:25,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

660
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:26,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for staying in Medford.

661
00:53:26,474 --> 00:53:26,494
[SPEAKER_06]: 16-428.

662
00:53:29,055 --> 00:53:34,236
[SPEAKER_06]: to the Honorable President and members of Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155.

663
00:53:34,296 --> 00:53:50,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Dear Mr. President and Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body confirm the appointment of Michael J. Lewis, who resides at 133 Pine Ridge Road, to the Medford Housing Authority for a five-year term to expire on April 8th, 2021.

664
00:53:51,421 --> 00:53:52,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Yikes.

665
00:53:53,422 --> 00:53:56,603
[SPEAKER_06]: A copy of Mr. Lewis's resume is attached for your review.

666
00:53:56,643 --> 00:53:57,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Lewis is present

667
00:53:58,241 --> 00:54:01,744
[SPEAKER_06]: at tonight's meeting to answer any questions the councilor may have.

668
00:54:02,104 --> 00:54:05,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Your consideration of this appointment is greatly appreciated.

669
00:54:05,987 --> 00:54:09,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Sincerely yours, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

670
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:10,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

671
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

672
00:54:12,692 --> 00:54:16,055
[SPEAKER_05]: Included in our packet this week, we have a copy of Mr. Lewis's credentials.

673
00:54:16,695 --> 00:54:20,058
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you go through them, they're rather impressive.

674
00:54:20,478 --> 00:54:25,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Gentleman's been practicing law in the Boston Housing Authority for a number of years as a litigator.

675
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:35,998
[SPEAKER_05]: has extensive experience as a courtroom litigator and a trial attorney, you know, well-educated with a law degree from Syracuse University and an undergrad summa cum laude from Assumption.

676
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:45,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I think it's clear to me that the gentleman does this for a living, and any type of volunteer service that he'd be willing to perform in our community here would be just a bonus at this point in time.

677
00:54:45,125 --> 00:54:45,926
[SPEAKER_05]: So I move for approval.

678
00:54:46,206 --> 00:54:46,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Precisely.

679
00:54:46,846 --> 00:54:50,890
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of approval by Counselor Knight, Counselor Caviello.

680
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

681
00:54:52,511 --> 00:54:53,492
[SPEAKER_06]: Whose spot will you be taking?

682
00:54:53,868 --> 00:54:54,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, sir.

683
00:54:54,789 --> 00:54:56,370
[SPEAKER_06]: If you would just present your name and address.

684
00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:00,553
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Michael Lewis, LOUIS 133 Pine Ridge Road.

685
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:02,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I, to be honest, I don't know.

686
00:55:02,494 --> 00:55:07,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe a member retired or just did not run for, did not ask to be reelected.

687
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,979
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a vacancy there.

688
00:55:09,179 --> 00:55:10,760
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's only four members currently.

689
00:55:11,001 --> 00:55:16,985
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, if you could find out who retired or who chose not to run, it would be appreciated.

690
00:55:17,265 --> 00:55:17,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

691
00:55:17,946 --> 00:55:18,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor.

692
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:29,334
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you would, as an amendment that the mayor's office will- And your qualifications are outstanding and I would support you on this.

696
00:55:42,982 --> 00:55:44,903
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may ask, what made you want to do it?

697
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:50,866
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a newer resident to Medford, and I actually enjoy housing, so I feel like this is a way I can give back to the community.

698
00:55:50,886 --> 00:55:54,468
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually an area I actually know a lot about, so it's a way for me to help the community.

699
00:55:54,508 --> 00:55:55,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's great.

700
00:55:55,949 --> 00:55:57,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good luck, and thank you.

701
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:57,410

704
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,540
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

705
00:56:05,861 --> 00:56:06,301
[SPEAKER_06]: You're on.

706
00:56:06,421 --> 00:56:06,881
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

707
00:56:07,202 --> 00:56:07,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

708
00:56:08,402 --> 00:56:13,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

709
00:56:13,906 --> 00:56:27,194
[SPEAKER_06]: 16-429, the Subcommittee on Zoning and Ordinances, chaired by Councillor Knight, yes, is just a beehive of activity.

710
00:56:28,387 --> 00:56:40,893
[SPEAKER_06]: And they reported out after the latest meeting that two pieces of papers be taken, received, and placed on file, and two be kept in committee.

711
00:56:41,413 --> 00:56:46,235
[SPEAKER_06]: So on motion of Councilor Knight to accept the committee report, all those in favor?

712
00:56:47,035 --> 00:56:47,936
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

713
00:56:49,096 --> 00:56:50,857
[SPEAKER_06]: We accept the committee report.

714
00:56:51,557 --> 00:56:51,737
[SPEAKER_06]: And so

715
00:56:56,762 --> 00:57:08,650
[SPEAKER_06]: on the motion of Councilor Falco to resort to the, or to go under suspension of the rules, to take papers under suspension and in the hand of the clerk.

716
00:57:09,091 --> 00:57:09,991
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

717
00:57:10,732 --> 00:57:13,954
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

718
00:57:13,974 --> 00:57:16,416
[SPEAKER_06]: 16-431 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Mass.

719
00:57:16,456 --> 00:57:22,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Department of Transportation and MBTA take the appropriate steps to have the land

720
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:25,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Butting the railroad tracks on Circuit Street cleaned out.

721
00:57:25,293 --> 00:57:25,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Knight?

722
00:57:26,414 --> 00:57:27,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Mr. President.

723
00:57:27,495 --> 00:57:32,197
[SPEAKER_05]: The big sweep went down Circuit Street on April 19th.

724
00:57:32,357 --> 00:57:42,003
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there was a lack of coordination with MassDOT, MBTA, to get the state property that would butt the railroad tracks along Circuit Street cleaned out.

725
00:57:42,733 --> 00:57:53,499
[SPEAKER_05]: While our streets are nice and clean, there's paper and debris that lay up against the fence on the small portion of land that would be the property of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the MBTA, Mr. President.

726
00:57:54,200 --> 00:58:02,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Where MassDOT and the MBTA are now under the same umbrella, I felt as though it would probably be the easiest to send it to MassDOT for them to send out to their appropriate department, Mr. President.

727
00:58:02,725 --> 00:58:11,390
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm asking that my colleagues support this resolution and bringing some cleanliness and beautification to Circuit Street in the interest of the quality of life.

728
00:58:12,062 --> 00:58:12,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

729
00:58:12,402 --> 00:58:18,244
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion for approved by council night, although in favor of all those goals, motion carries 16 dash four 32 off by council caviello.

730
00:58:19,065 --> 00:58:36,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Metro city council can grant commend the construction company that did the road work on Austin road, their repaving of the streets in that area after completion should set an example to how all companies should return the roads upon completion.

731
00:58:36,992 --> 00:58:37,852
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor Caviello.

732
00:58:38,173 --> 00:58:39,393
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President, especially, you know,

733
00:58:39,948 --> 00:58:52,851
[SPEAKER_13]: I've lived in this community my whole life, and every time a construction company leaves the city, they dig up, within a year or less, the holes are sinking, they're scraggly.

734
00:58:53,431 --> 00:59:05,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Over the last couple of weeks, as I drove up the Austin Road, these guys did an outstanding job of bringing the road back to better than where it was when they started.

735
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:12,882
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think this should set an example to how all construction companies that do work in our roads take their roads back.

736
00:59:13,683 --> 00:59:16,944
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to say, anyone who's around, take a ride up there.

737
00:59:17,024 --> 00:59:18,305
[SPEAKER_13]: See what an outstanding job they did.

738
00:59:18,705 --> 00:59:21,886
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, these guys should be commended for the excellent work they did.

739
00:59:22,407 --> 00:59:23,967
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion is approved by Councilor Caviello.

740
00:59:23,987 --> 00:59:24,648

746
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:50,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Bill follows his dad, Bill Senior, and Uncle Jack, former West Point hockey coach, on being the first three members of one family winning this prestigious award.

747
00:59:51,304 --> 00:59:55,366
[SPEAKER_06]: The Riley family has a long history of achievements at Medford High School.

748
00:59:55,886 --> 00:59:56,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caviello.

749
00:59:56,586 --> 00:59:57,247
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

750
00:59:57,507 --> 01:00:00,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Those of you who know, hockey runs deep in my family.

751
01:00:00,808 --> 01:00:03,770
[SPEAKER_13]: My son played both high school and college hockey.

752
01:00:05,078 --> 01:00:09,641
[SPEAKER_13]: The Stewarts are well known for their contributions to all the high school programs in this area.

753
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:15,684
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I just want to congratulate Mr. Stewart on this prestigious award that he received.

754
01:00:15,964 --> 01:00:16,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

755
01:00:16,365 --> 01:00:17,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations to the Reillys.

756
01:00:17,745 --> 01:00:18,886
[SPEAKER_06]: We're very grateful to you all.

757
01:00:19,266 --> 01:00:21,067
[SPEAKER_06]: A motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

758
01:00:21,127 --> 01:00:21,768
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

759
01:00:22,428 --> 01:00:22,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

760
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:23,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carries.

761
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:25,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Councilor Caviello, 16-434.

762
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:32,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council requests that the Park Department fix the open ground water box

763
01:00:34,147 --> 01:00:44,654
[SPEAKER_06]: the opened groundwater box at Drain Field in the interest of public safety to our children and their families who visit this field.

764
01:00:44,714 --> 01:00:45,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that in Medford?

765
01:00:45,875 --> 01:00:46,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it is, Mr. President.

766
01:00:46,676 --> 01:00:50,718
[SPEAKER_13]: That's in back of the McGlynn School, the Andrews and McGlynn.

767
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:55,382
[SPEAKER_13]: I offered something similar to the proposal last week to Carpark.

768
01:00:55,802 --> 01:00:59,905
[SPEAKER_13]: And in the ground, there's all these plastic boxes, but the covers are all broken on them, Mr. President.

769
01:01:00,425 --> 01:01:03,007
[SPEAKER_13]: And this one, actually, this one's been broken for a couple of years now.

770
01:01:03,706 --> 01:01:10,592
[SPEAKER_13]: And I tell you, it's only going to be a matter of time before some kid or some parent falls in the hole, and we're sued for this.

771
01:01:10,652 --> 01:01:15,316
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I would think that the fix of the plastic top is a lot cheaper than a lot of suits.

772
01:01:15,336 --> 01:01:15,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Precisely.

773
01:01:16,537 --> 01:01:18,799
[SPEAKER_13]: If we can get this done, it would be greatly appreciated, Mr. President.

774

[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion approved by Councilor Caviello.

775
01:01:21,441 --> 01:01:22,062
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

776
01:01:22,082 --> 01:01:22,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

777
01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:23,743
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

780
01:01:25,705 --> 01:01:26,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Good work, Councilor.

782
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:56,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas, Del Centro Corporation performed sewer maintenance on Clematis Road that was completed on April 13th, and whereas, a significant amount of construction debris, including cones, pallets, pipes, and equipment remain at this location, be it resolved the city administration take the proper steps to ensure the construction debris on Clematis Road is removed and that the street and sidewalk are in acceptable condition, Councilor Knight.

783
01:01:57,627 --> 01:01:59,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

784
01:01:59,088 --> 01:02:00,889
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the resolution speaks for itself.

785
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:06,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caviello wants to take our friends from D'Alessandro down on a field trip to Austin Road.

786
01:02:06,274 --> 01:02:10,077
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be suitable at this point in time, but I've been by the location.

787
01:02:10,097 --> 01:02:12,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I've received pictures as well from area residents.

788
01:02:13,583 --> 01:02:15,003
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mess, Mr. President, and I have them back.

789
01:02:15,043 --> 01:02:27,286
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm asking that the administration take the appropriate steps to be sure that the area is cleaned and left free of debris, but also that our streets and sidewalks are also remaining in acceptable condition like they were prior to the construction work.

790
01:02:28,246 --> 01:02:28,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

01:02:32,306 --> 01:02:33,247
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion carries.

794
01:02:33,787 --> 01:02:40,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Councilor Caviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate Medford Police Officer Charlie Hartnett

795
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:48,388
[SPEAKER_06]: for purchasing basketball nets for Rockwell Avenue Playground, and his police partners, and the fire department for helping install the nets.

796
01:02:48,448 --> 01:02:49,208
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Caviello.

797
01:02:49,508 --> 01:02:50,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

798
01:02:50,148 --> 01:02:54,210
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we're quick to criticize the policemen when they do something wrong, but let's- I'm not.

799
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, a lot of people are in this community.

800
01:02:57,511 --> 01:02:59,712
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, he's a young guy.

801
01:02:59,752 --> 01:03:01,013
[SPEAKER_13]: I've known him since he was a child.

802
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Took it upon himself.

803
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:05,014
[SPEAKER_13]: He saw the kids out there with no nets.

804
01:03:05,054 --> 01:03:08,135
[SPEAKER_13]: He went and bought them himself with a couple of his partners.

805
01:03:08,155 --> 01:03:10,096
[SPEAKER_13]: The fire department came down, put them up,

806
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:16,622
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a good kid, does good things in the community, and I think he should be commended.

807
01:03:16,882 --> 01:03:20,644
[SPEAKER_13]: And the fire department who came down and lent their hand, they should also be commended.

808
01:03:20,664 --> 01:03:23,005
[SPEAKER_13]: So good job to everybody.

809
01:03:23,225 --> 01:03:23,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Right you are.

810
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,467
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

811
01:03:27,367 --> 01:03:28,048
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

812
01:03:28,088 --> 01:03:28,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carried.

813
01:03:29,288 --> 01:03:30,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Councilor Marks.

814
01:03:30,989 --> 01:03:37,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the basketball rims at Magoon Park be replaced, whereas loops that hold the net were broken off.

815
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:38,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks?

816
01:03:39,536 --> 01:03:40,417
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

817
01:03:40,437 --> 01:03:43,459
[SPEAKER_16]: We all know Magoon Park was done over less than a year ago.

818
01:03:44,399 --> 01:03:51,904
[SPEAKER_16]: And all four basketball rims at the park, which the basketball court area was done magnificently.

819
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:57,948
[SPEAKER_16]: Each of the little eye loops that hold the net on are all broken off.

820
01:03:58,687 --> 01:04:10,955
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if that's from hanging on the rim, or if it's intentionally done, but without the eye loops, you can't string a net, and it's not fun playing without a net on a basketball rim, I can tell you that firsthand.

821
01:04:11,316 --> 01:04:20,522
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask that the Pac department go out there immediately and replace the rims at Magoon Pac on all four basketball rims.

822
01:04:21,048 --> 01:04:23,549
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, hoops on the motion for rule by Councilor Marks.

01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:32,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

829
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:34,111
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a lot of email traffic.

830
01:04:35,311 --> 01:04:36,651
[SPEAKER_16]: We did get a lot of time a year.

831
01:04:37,011 --> 01:04:39,592
[SPEAKER_16]: We did get a lot of email traffic, Mr. President.

832
01:04:39,712 --> 01:04:43,173
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's unfortunate that, uh, it's groundhog day.

833
01:04:43,273 --> 01:04:48,454
[SPEAKER_16]: Once again, in this community, we revisit the same issues over and over and over every year.

834
01:04:49,253 --> 01:04:57,899
[SPEAKER_16]: rather than addressing them, creating meaningful policy to follow in this community, we just revisit the same issue.

835
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:02,062
[SPEAKER_16]: It's from August to September, April to May.

836
01:05:02,082 --> 01:05:04,884
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate to isolate certain areas, but

837
01:05:05,565 --> 01:05:21,144
[SPEAKER_16]: In particular, up the hillside, it's when I get the phone calls and the emails that students start to put out mattresses on the sidewalks, old furniture, trash, debris, nothing in barrels at all, which we all know the new barrel program, they won't pick anything up.

838
01:05:21,798 --> 01:05:24,279
[SPEAKER_16]: Mattresses you have to call on, and they will come out.

839
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:42,685
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think we have to, in addition to stepping up code enforcement throughout the whole community, in particular in the Tufts neighborhood and all those streets, Mr. President, we have to do a better job in finding — it's tough to go after the students, but finding the property owners.

840
01:05:44,926 --> 01:05:51,408
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, once we start hitting the property owners in their pocket, they'll make sure that their tenants are abiding by the rules and regulations.

841
01:05:51,868 --> 01:05:56,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, I think Tufts University has to do a better job in policing their students.

842
01:05:57,251 --> 01:06:05,415
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't want to say they're all tough students that are dumping, but in this particular area, there are a majority of students that do it every year.

843
01:06:05,475 --> 01:06:06,295
[SPEAKER_16]: This is nothing new.

844
01:06:06,716 --> 01:06:12,478
[SPEAKER_16]: Every year, we feel the phone calls and neighbors say, how would you like to look at a mattress that's been out there for three weeks?

845
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,260
[SPEAKER_16]: And waste management won't pick it up.

846
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:16,661
[SPEAKER_16]: The city refuses to pick it up.

847
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:19,542
[SPEAKER_16]: There's TVs outside and curbs.

848
01:06:20,222 --> 01:06:21,443
[SPEAKER_16]: It really is deplorable.

849
01:06:21,976 --> 01:06:25,518
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wouldn't want this next to my house, and no resident should have to live like this.

850
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:42,590
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would ask that the city administration create a policy, Mr. President, regarding illegal dumping, in particular in the Tufts neighborhood, the Tufts area, and code enforcement start to get out there

851
01:06:43,187 --> 01:06:49,793
[SPEAKER_16]: and start enforcing some of the rules and regulations that prohibit dumping on the sidewalk, Mr. President.

852
01:06:50,113 --> 01:06:55,958
[SPEAKER_06]: The university has to step up to the plague counselor and the landlords who profit.

853
01:06:56,611 --> 01:06:59,192
[SPEAKER_06]: from these rentals need to step up to the plate.

854
01:06:59,212 --> 01:06:59,852
[SPEAKER_06]: You're exactly right.

855
01:06:59,913 --> 01:07:00,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

856
01:07:00,093 --> 01:07:02,234
[SPEAKER_16]: So by finding them, that'll help one aspect.

857
01:07:02,794 --> 01:07:18,241
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe we forget Barbara Rubel, who's the Tufts liaison to the city, help and sit down with this community on ways we can improve communication and have students abide by the rules and regulations.

858
01:07:18,721 --> 01:07:20,842
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know, the one resident that mentioned

859
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:28,224
[SPEAKER_16]: Council of Penta, for all his different resolutions, he offered a suggestion a few years ago about cleanup week.

860
01:07:28,685 --> 01:07:31,551
[SPEAKER_16]: And he said, why not have the city once or twice a week and

861
01:07:32,285 --> 01:07:34,127
[SPEAKER_16]: once or twice a year actually at the time.

862
01:07:34,428 --> 01:07:41,996
[SPEAKER_16]: He said, go out in trucks, let residents know you'll be in their neighborhood, and you can dump whatever you want in the back of our trucks.

863
01:07:42,636 --> 01:07:48,202
[SPEAKER_16]: And I thought it was a great solution to getting rid of some items that may be tough to get rid of.

864
01:07:48,222 --> 01:07:53,688
[SPEAKER_16]: And that would probably be a great idea for the Tufts neighborhood to have trucks out there

865
01:07:53,988 --> 01:07:57,811
[SPEAKER_16]: during these times when they move in and when they move out, roaming the area.

866
01:07:57,831 --> 01:08:03,516
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, it only improves our community and the quality of life of residents.

867
01:08:03,556 --> 01:08:13,805
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would offer that, Mr. President, also that the city look at the clean it week or two week or whatever it may be that was offered some time back.

868
01:08:13,825 --> 01:08:14,885
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a great suggestion.

869
01:08:14,905 --> 01:08:19,870
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's

870
01:08:20,865 --> 01:08:25,966
[SPEAKER_09]: great resolve with regards to adding something about Tufts too, you know, once school ends.

871
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:46,332
[SPEAKER_09]: I put that resolution, I know we've all probably put that resolution on, but I put that resolution on about a month ago, and I got an update from the mayor's office today that our DPW director, Brian Cairns, has contacted waste management in the process of getting a cost estimate to do a cleanup fix-up week where the waste management would come

872
01:08:46,846 --> 01:08:54,349
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully, with due notice to the residents, three, four weeks, you know, three weeks notice, so we can do a spring cleanup, hopefully, you know, the end of next month.

873
01:08:54,449 --> 01:09:01,092
[SPEAKER_09]: So, they are trying to get a cost estimate, and I thank the mayor's office and the DPW for trying to work on that for our residents.

874
01:09:01,572 --> 01:09:06,614
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I think adding the fact, getting Tufts cleaned up at the end of the year, it would be huge.

875
01:09:07,034 --> 01:09:09,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

876
01:09:09,275 --> 01:09:10,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks, your remarks are all set?

877
01:09:11,216 --> 01:09:11,836
[SPEAKER_06]: They are, thank you.

878
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:13,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much for this motion, Councilor.

879
01:09:14,237 --> 01:09:15,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

880
01:09:16,012 --> 01:09:30,218
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to, if I can, Mr. President, I just want to commend Lauren Felch in the mayor's office and Mr. Bavuso for a quick response because within 24 hours that was cleaned up and the homeowner was cited.

881
01:09:30,358 --> 01:09:44,084
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think with that type of, that type of turnaround and that, that, that kick to the wallet, I think is going to be a real, real benefit to what we're having in this issue.

882
01:09:44,124 --> 01:09:45,545
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you precisely.

883
01:09:46,334 --> 01:09:46,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

884
01:09:47,535 --> 01:09:50,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, thank you very much, and thank you, Councilor Marks, for bringing this matter forward.

885
01:09:50,977 --> 01:09:58,201
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're all receiving a lot of the same calls, and more importantly, we're all seeing the mess that's out there when we drive down the streets.

886
01:09:59,502 --> 01:10:11,189
[SPEAKER_05]: And not to pick on Tufts University, but, I mean, I think the fact of the matter is, when students move out of their apartments, they are leaving Medford, and they don't have a vested interest in Medford, so they don't really care what kind of mess they leave behind.

887
01:10:11,929 --> 01:10:15,151
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple years ago, Mr. President, the city of Somerville adopted an ordinance

888
01:10:15,715 --> 01:10:29,720
[SPEAKER_05]: and the City of Boston has adopted an ordinance, and the City of Medford has discussed adopting an ordinance, and I think that it's something we should take a look at, which would be a university accountability ordinance, Mr. President, which would require the university to register with the city

889
01:10:30,212 --> 01:10:37,536
[SPEAKER_05]: the units that are being rented by students, so that we know where they are, so that if issues of public safety come up, we know how to identify them.

890
01:10:37,636 --> 01:10:46,522
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, God forbid there was an outbreak of a contagious disease or something like that up on the campus, at least at this point in time, we'd be able to identify where these people live, and if we needed to quarantine them, so be it.

891
01:10:47,525 --> 01:10:48,906
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Counselor Marks.

892
01:10:48,986 --> 01:10:49,206
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

893
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:50,787
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, that's a great suggestion.

894
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:53,609
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was back some probably five, six, seven years ago.

895
01:10:54,089 --> 01:11:01,514
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a great debate with Tufts University about asking them if we can get notification where students live off campus.

896
01:11:02,014 --> 01:11:05,657
[SPEAKER_16]: And at the time, Mr. President, I don't know if anyone remembers that debate, but I do.

897
01:11:05,857 --> 01:11:15,763
[SPEAKER_16]: They refused to give out any information on any student living off campus that let us know who was living on the Method side or the Somerville side in Tufts housing, but not off campus.

898
01:11:16,607 --> 01:11:27,450
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was one of the reasons we were trying to address ways we can contact students and possibly update them if Tufts is not doing a good job about city codes and enforcement and so forth.

899
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:30,531
[SPEAKER_16]: But maybe we could try that process again.

900
01:11:30,571 --> 01:11:33,452
[SPEAKER_16]: But they were adamant back some years ago they would not release.

901
01:11:33,552 --> 01:11:36,412
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's cited privacy laws, if I remember correctly.

902
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:37,573
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my understanding.

903
01:11:37,853 --> 01:11:42,614
[SPEAKER_06]: Departmentally within the college, there were some areas of reporting that one department couldn't share with the other.

904
01:11:43,404 --> 01:11:48,668
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my understanding, Mr. President, that Tufts University, who operates a school in Boston, is complying with the Boston ordinance.

905
01:11:49,248 --> 01:11:51,750
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I understand, they're also complying with the Sumner ordinance.

906
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:55,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, but I think that Councilman Mack makes a good point.

907
01:11:56,453 --> 01:11:57,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Garbage in, garbage out.

908
01:11:57,293 --> 01:11:59,234
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're not giving us good information, it doesn't matter anyway.

909
01:11:59,915 --> 01:12:11,102
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to give us good information and they need to be a partner in this and they need to be sure that they have the same concerns that we have relative to the quality of life in this community and in the neighborhoods and protecting the neighborhoods, Mr. President.

910
01:12:11,853 --> 01:12:14,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Caviello has a great quote when it comes to Tufts University.

911
01:12:14,475 --> 01:12:17,498
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he says, Somerville gets all the benefits and Medford gets the rest.

912
01:12:18,058 --> 01:12:23,123
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I think it's time that we really take a look at that and we try to leverage our partnership with Tufts University.

913
01:12:25,044 --> 01:12:25,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

914
01:12:26,646 --> 01:12:28,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

915
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:29,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

916
01:12:29,468 --> 01:12:31,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

917
01:12:32,531 --> 01:12:39,156
[SPEAKER_11]: I, like all of you, have received calls and emails yesterday regarding the issue and actually Sunday regarding the issue.

918
01:12:40,571 --> 01:12:49,297
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks again to John Bovuso for acting on it quickly and having it cleaned up immediately and for citing the homeowner.

919
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:57,522
[SPEAKER_11]: But I guess my question is, and I'm not sure if you would know this, Mr. President, does the city do anything right now to communicate with the homeowners?

920
01:12:58,723 --> 01:13:03,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any type of communication that the city does to communicate with the property owners in that area?

921
01:13:04,047 --> 01:13:06,789
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be a question directed to the building department.

922
01:13:07,069 --> 01:13:07,309
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

923
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:10,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Could we maybe get a report back from the building department?

924
01:13:10,905 --> 01:13:17,308
[SPEAKER_11]: to find out what kind of communication goes out from the city to the property owners up in that area with regard to cleanup.

925
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:31,555
[SPEAKER_11]: When I talked to John Babuso tonight, he had mentioned to me that, I guess, I think the property owner was not aware of, you know, I think the policies regarding dumping things on the sidewalk.

926
01:13:31,595 --> 01:13:35,396
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I mean, it seems like common sense.

927
01:13:35,436 --> 01:13:36,757
[SPEAKER_11]: I took a drive up there yesterday.

928
01:13:37,197 --> 01:13:39,998
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a disgrace, I'm sorry, on Sunday afternoon, it was a disgrace.

929
01:13:40,018 --> 01:13:41,119
[SPEAKER_11]: There was stuff all over the place.

930
01:13:41,499 --> 01:13:43,480
[SPEAKER_11]: The residents should not have to live like that.

931
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:54,504
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd also support Councilor Knight's idea about having an ordinance with regarding having the university be accountable.

932
01:13:54,824 --> 01:13:56,725
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's something that we should look at in subcommittee.

933
01:13:57,225 --> 01:13:57,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good.

934
01:13:58,005 --> 01:13:58,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

935
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:01,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is amended further by Councilor Knight.

936
01:14:02,503 --> 01:14:03,203
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caviello.

937
01:14:03,343 --> 01:14:03,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

938
01:14:05,204 --> 01:14:13,426
[SPEAKER_13]: If memory serves me correct, I fought for many years on this council, not as many as some of the other ones here, but to get a part-time code enforcement officer.

939
01:14:13,466 --> 01:14:15,387
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do stand corrected.

940
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:16,327
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we do have one.

941
01:14:16,567 --> 01:14:17,028
[SPEAKER_13]: You got it.

942
01:14:17,528 --> 01:14:18,028
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

943
01:14:18,048 --> 01:14:24,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I haven't seen the gentleman, so I would like the gentleman maybe to, rather than wait for us to get these calls,

944
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:35,531
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe if he can get out there a couple days away, maybe two or three days a week, drive around that tough area and look for these things rather than us waiting to get the calls would be helpful.

945
01:14:35,651 --> 01:14:48,716
[SPEAKER_13]: So if that could be a request to the building department to get the assistant code enforcement out up to the tough area, drive around two or three days a week, maybe for a couple of hours and spot these things before we get the phone calls.

946
01:14:49,243 --> 01:14:49,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

947
01:14:49,703 --> 01:15:02,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So under the motion offered under suspension by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilors, Vice President Lungel-Kern, Knight, Scarpelli, Falco, Caraviello, and Councilor Marks.

948
01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:03,371
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

949
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:03,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

950
01:15:03,951 --> 01:15:04,591
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

951
01:15:05,232 --> 01:15:05,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carries.

952
01:15:06,552 --> 01:15:16,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered again under suspension by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the electronic speeding on High Street near the Brooks School be repaired in the interest of public safety.

953
01:15:16,838 --> 01:15:18,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you mean the speeding detector or device?

954
01:15:21,693 --> 01:15:22,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor.

955
01:15:22,173 --> 01:15:22,493
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

956
01:15:23,773 --> 01:15:24,574
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

957
01:15:24,594 --> 01:15:34,836
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, the electronic speeding sign that is located on High Street right before Brooks School, if you're going up towards the square, is not functioning.

958
01:15:35,696 --> 01:15:42,217
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know in this community, I'm hearing from a lot of different residents regarding pedestrian safety.

959
01:15:43,057 --> 01:15:46,818
[SPEAKER_16]: And these are the initiatives that this council has been pushing forward.

960
01:15:47,152 --> 01:15:59,703
[SPEAKER_16]: the electronic speed signs, raised crosswalks, widening sidewalks, thermoplastic crosswalks, and it's disheartening when you see something that was put up recently that's not functioning.

961
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,503
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a real concern, Mr. President.

962
01:16:03,843 --> 01:16:08,427
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we've been talking about painted crosswalks, why we can't get them painted.

963
01:16:08,908 --> 01:16:14,332
[SPEAKER_16]: A third of this year is already over, and our crosswalks are still not painted.

964
01:16:15,333 --> 01:16:17,815
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure, like, when do you do them?

965
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:20,158
[SPEAKER_16]: It just doesn't make any sense.

966
01:16:21,098 --> 01:16:22,540
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, and, you know, I

967
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:26,393
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems sometimes they're done with chalk instead.

968
01:16:26,513 --> 01:16:36,356
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, let me tell you, Mr. President, you know, I wrote an op-ed piece in the newspaper a couple of weeks ago regarding do you feel safe in your neighborhood?

969
01:16:37,096 --> 01:16:51,760
[SPEAKER_16]: And let me tell you, the comments that I was expecting to get, and I'm going to make a presentation before this council, but the comments I was expecting to get regarding break-ins and car break-ins and home invasions and so forth are not the comments I received.

970
01:16:52,231 --> 01:16:58,935
[SPEAKER_16]: It's pedestrian safety comments over and over and over and over again throughout the entire community.

971
01:16:59,716 --> 01:17:01,397
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's the feedback that I'm getting.

972
01:17:01,457 --> 01:17:10,102
[SPEAKER_16]: And this council, and I can speak for myself and my colleagues, we've been pushing for pedestrian traffic calming initiatives.

973
01:17:10,762 --> 01:17:18,687
[SPEAKER_16]: And for some reason, even when they do implement something, the sign breaks within a year or the crosswalk never gets repainted.

974
01:17:20,024 --> 01:17:23,467
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, these are basic things in a community.

975
01:17:24,148 --> 01:17:30,054
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, if there wasn't a fatality on this street of this community, I'd say, you know what, we're doing a great job.

976
01:17:30,434 --> 01:17:37,381
[SPEAKER_16]: But indeed, if you look over the past 15 to 20 years, there's been a number of fatalities on Method Roads in this community.

977
01:17:38,062 --> 01:17:42,946
[SPEAKER_16]: And not all of it's due to a lack of signage and faded crosswalks.

978
01:17:42,986 --> 01:17:43,647
[SPEAKER_16]: But let me tell you,

979
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:49,962
[SPEAKER_16]: It's largely a part of the city not pushing forward initiatives like they do in Cambridge.

980
01:17:49,982 --> 01:17:57,407
[SPEAKER_16]: You go on the Cambridge website, they have a whole section under their traffic division of traffic calming approaches.

981
01:17:58,348 --> 01:17:59,889
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't need to recreate the wheel.

982
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:02,751
[SPEAKER_16]: We can go and steal all their ideas, Mr. President.

983
01:18:03,171 --> 01:18:04,372
[SPEAKER_16]: They hired consultants.

984
01:18:04,432 --> 01:18:07,414
[SPEAKER_16]: They went through thousands, tens of thousands of dollars.

985
01:18:08,015 --> 01:18:08,715
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know what?

986
01:18:09,096 --> 01:18:10,997
[SPEAKER_16]: We have all this information in front of us.

987
01:18:11,587 --> 01:18:18,290
[SPEAKER_16]: And for whatever reason, and I don't think it's funding, because where there's a will, there's a way, we just don't move forward on these initiatives.

988
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:27,913
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll create a bike path that leads to nowhere on a road, but we won't do the basic pedestrian traffic initiatives that need to be done.

989
01:18:28,593 --> 01:18:32,155
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that's a long way around this particular speeding sign being out,

990
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:35,727
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I took a bike ride Saturday.

991
01:18:36,127 --> 01:18:39,409
[SPEAKER_16]: And let me tell you, Mr. President, walking, you probably see a lot.

992
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:41,070
[SPEAKER_16]: Bike riding, you see a lot.

993
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:42,411
[SPEAKER_16]: When you're in a car, you see very little.

994
01:18:42,952 --> 01:18:45,954
[SPEAKER_16]: You drive by things and you don't recognize anything for some reason.

995
01:18:46,274 --> 01:18:47,195
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe it's tunnel vision.

996
01:18:47,595 --> 01:18:53,999
[SPEAKER_16]: But let me tell you, a lot of the things that I noticed just driving my bike around was eye-opening.

997
01:18:54,600 --> 01:19:01,304
[SPEAKER_16]: And maybe some of the city administration around here should take a bike ride and see what's going on in this community.

998
01:19:02,665 --> 01:19:04,486
[SPEAKER_16]: But that's all I have to offer, Mr. President.

999
01:19:04,886 --> 01:19:05,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1000
01:19:05,226 --> 01:19:08,107
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion approved by Councilman Marks, Councilman Knight.

1001
01:19:08,528 --> 01:19:09,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, yes.

1002
01:19:09,428 --> 01:19:10,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

1003
01:19:10,148 --> 01:19:12,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And Councilman Marks, thank you for bringing this matter up.

1004
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:21,273
[SPEAKER_05]: On May 5th at six o'clock in room 201, the city administration is going to be having a public meeting concerning

1005
01:19:21,737 --> 01:19:22,957
[SPEAKER_05]: the Complete Streets Program.

1006
01:19:23,318 --> 01:19:27,239
[SPEAKER_05]: And in our packet this week, we had a meeting notice that referred to this.

1007
01:19:27,899 --> 01:19:38,563
[SPEAKER_05]: And the Complete Streets Program refers to roadways that are designed and operated for safe access for all users, including pedestrians, bicyclists, motorists, and public transit users of all ages and abilities.

1008
01:19:39,084 --> 01:19:50,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So what this is, is it's a program where you sign up with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and they help you adopt some best practices, and they provide funding on how to implement those best practices, Mr. President.

1009
01:19:50,884 --> 01:19:57,669
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that this will be a great event for all, especially in light of the commentary and in segue to the commentary that Councillor Marks just made.

1010
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:05,054
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd just like to be sure that everybody is aware that that's going on from 6 to 7 on May 5th in Room 201 here at City Hall.

1011
01:20:05,094 --> 01:20:07,276
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion for approval by Councillor Marks.

1012
01:20:07,616 --> 01:20:08,457
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favour?

1013
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:10,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, please.

1014
01:20:11,468 --> 01:20:15,451
[SPEAKER_16]: Just if I could, because, you know, I read about the Complete Streets, and I think that's great.

1015
01:20:16,352 --> 01:20:22,137
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of its funding, it might be yearly funding, or it might be funding that dries up after a few years.

1016
01:20:22,897 --> 01:20:24,038
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a great initiative.

1017
01:20:24,439 --> 01:20:28,382
[SPEAKER_16]: However, the administration has to put forward policies and procedures.

1018
01:20:29,362 --> 01:20:38,790
[SPEAKER_16]: In particular, when we talked about thermoplastic crosswalks several weeks ago, when I offered for the fourth time a resolution that there be a policy created in our community

1019
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:47,373
[SPEAKER_16]: that doesn't paint crosswalks anymore, but uses the alternative, thermoplastic, which is highly reflective, slip-resistant, and lasts up to five years.

1020
01:20:47,893 --> 01:20:50,255
[SPEAKER_16]: These are the initiatives that you've got to create policy around.

1021
01:20:50,575 --> 01:20:58,181
[SPEAKER_16]: It's nice to get one-time fixes from the state, and it makes for a great picture in the newspaper, and a photo op, and a great story.

1022
01:20:58,501 --> 01:21:01,444
[SPEAKER_16]: However, long-term, it does nothing for this community.

1023
01:21:01,904 --> 01:21:06,708
[SPEAKER_16]: And these are the initiatives I think we have to look at, and I just don't see it happening.

1024
01:21:07,716 --> 01:21:14,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor, you've been an advocate for the thermoplastic crosswalks since I came on this body.

1025
01:21:16,346 --> 01:21:17,107
[SPEAKER_06]: As a clear and steady voice.

1026
01:21:17,187 --> 01:21:18,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And what good has that done me?

1027
01:21:19,049 --> 01:21:22,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Counselor, on the motion for approval, all those in favor?

1028
01:21:23,134 --> 01:21:23,875
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1029
01:21:23,895 --> 01:21:25,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carries.

1030
01:21:25,356 --> 01:21:26,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Counselor Marks.

1031
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:40,235
[SPEAKER_06]: be it resolved that the weeds and trash along the BJ's Wholesale Fence on Woodruff Ave be cleaned by BJ's, whereas they have committed to maintain both sides of the fence.

1032
01:21:40,716 --> 01:21:41,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

1033
01:21:42,316 --> 01:21:43,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1034
01:21:43,697 --> 01:21:55,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Every year, residents from Woodruff Ave that abut the BJ's Fence call up in concern about the fence and the particular debris that blows up

1035
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:59,156
[SPEAKER_16]: as well as the overgrowth and weeds in that particular area.

1036
01:22:00,317 --> 01:22:13,391
[SPEAKER_16]: BJ's committed back some years ago when they put a brand new fence along the whole perimeter to help with some of the noise reduction in the area, that they would also maintain both sides of the fence.

1037
01:22:13,771 --> 01:22:15,453
[SPEAKER_16]: I know our DPW has been out there, but

1038
01:22:15,843 --> 01:22:27,709
[SPEAKER_16]: I would once again ask that we send a correspondence to the manager at BJ's to get out there and clean the area along the fence, Mr. President.

1039
01:22:27,949 --> 01:22:29,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that, Councilor.

1040
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:32,311
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes a difference in the neighborhood, a big difference.

1041
01:22:32,612 --> 01:22:34,332
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have a motion for approval by Councilor Marks.

1042
01:22:34,372 --> 01:22:35,073
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1043
01:22:35,633 --> 01:22:36,293
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1044
01:22:36,353 --> 01:22:36,974
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion carries.

1045
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:38,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

1046
01:22:38,575 --> 01:22:43,837
[SPEAKER_06]: The records of the meeting of April 12th, 2016, will pass to Vice President Munger-Kern.

1047
01:22:45,823 --> 01:22:46,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1048
01:22:46,143 --> 01:22:56,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Before the record's a call, we got a notice in our packet with regards to the Medford School Committee meeting yesterday, last night, Monday night.

1049
01:22:57,027 --> 01:23:01,788
[SPEAKER_09]: It was an executive session, so I don't know how much is open to the public, but I'm just going to read the notice.

1050
01:23:02,508 --> 01:23:07,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Discussions of negotiations under Exemption 6 of the Open Meeting Law.

1051
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:14,412
[SPEAKER_09]: This exemption allows the committee to consider the lease or real value of real property in an executive session since an open

1052
01:23:15,155 --> 01:23:19,416
[SPEAKER_09]: discussion may have a detrimental effect on the negotiation position of the school committee.

1053
01:23:20,137 --> 01:23:37,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Specifically, the school committee will review and discuss information regarding the field of dreams, athletic fields, and the possibility of leasing the complex to an external party on a limited basis for considerations to be determined by the school committee and in negotiations with prospective vendors.

1054
01:23:38,023 --> 01:23:43,605
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what type of update we can get from the school committee or the school department,

1055
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:50,644
[SPEAKER_09]: With regards to the Field of Dreams, you know, the Medford City Council did help with approving a bond for the Field of Dreams.

1056
01:23:51,024 --> 01:23:58,549
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm very curious, as a first, I'm hearing of any type of leasing of the Field of Dreams and obviously have my own concerns.

1057
01:23:58,669 --> 01:24:10,557
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was just hoping that maybe the city council can be brought in to the discussion, whether that be an executive session or just by a formal update from the school department.

1058
01:24:11,576 --> 01:24:20,264
[SPEAKER_09]: leasing a complex where our children, the city of Medford, obviously we have first dibs on the fields.

1059
01:24:20,665 --> 01:24:21,966
[SPEAKER_09]: They're amazing fields.

1060
01:24:22,226 --> 01:24:32,515
[SPEAKER_09]: They did a great job on them, but I just have questions and concerns that I think, obviously, this is budget-related, and I think we need to be brought into the process.

1061
01:24:32,555 --> 01:24:37,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to be updated with whatever way we can be updated, because this is the first I've heard of it.

1062
01:24:37,927 --> 01:24:40,268
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam Vice President, would you like to add in motion form?

1063
01:24:40,388 --> 01:24:40,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.

1064
01:24:41,049 --> 01:24:47,352
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of the Madam Vice President, Brianna Lungo Kern, that the school department, i.e.

1065
01:24:47,492 --> 01:25:04,221
[SPEAKER_06]: the superintendent of schools, make aware or present to the city council the matter of what is going on vis-a-vis a possibility of a lease of the facility of the

1066
01:25:06,324 --> 01:25:09,265
[SPEAKER_06]: so-called Field of Dreams, I know it has a real name, Councilor?

1067
01:25:11,366 --> 01:25:12,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Edgley Field.

1068
01:25:12,926 --> 01:25:29,771
[SPEAKER_06]: And that the City Council be apprised of this and what effects it would have on usage that should be given preferential usage to city organizations and school sports.

1069
01:25:31,411 --> 01:25:33,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I get all of that, Madam Vice President?

1070
01:25:33,172 --> 01:25:33,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect, yes.

1071
01:25:33,672 --> 01:25:33,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1072
01:25:34,425 --> 01:25:44,050
[SPEAKER_09]: like to be apprised from either, I mean the mayor's office, obviously she sits on this committee, so any way we can get an update or be brought into the discussion.

1073
01:25:44,410 --> 01:25:59,798
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it was mentioned earlier that the mayor has a meeting with the city council, and I think we probably should put a number of different things for discussion on that, including obviously the schools in general and what's going on, and this could be one of those things.

1074
01:26:01,438 --> 01:26:03,720
[SPEAKER_06]: It was ultimately the council that funded that project.

1075
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:04,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

1076
01:26:05,181 --> 01:26:05,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

1077
01:26:06,301 --> 01:26:09,303
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, I actually have a comment and something else so I can wait.

1078
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1079
01:26:10,344 --> 01:26:15,347
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion of a vice president local current, all those in favor, all those opposed, the motion carries.

1080
01:26:15,748 --> 01:26:16,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falco.

1081
01:26:16,688 --> 01:26:17,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1082
01:26:17,989 --> 01:26:21,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I, uh, see, uh, back in January.

1083
01:26:21,732 --> 01:26:27,616
[SPEAKER_11]: So about three months ago I offered a resolution one six dash Oh one eight regarding the city's budget upcoming budget.

1084
01:26:27,936 --> 01:26:29,417
[SPEAKER_11]: And I had asked for a budget template.

1085
01:26:30,014 --> 01:26:32,295
[SPEAKER_11]: from the finance director, from the administration.

1086
01:26:33,095 --> 01:26:39,797
[SPEAKER_11]: We have still not—we haven't heard anything from the finance director, and we are getting into budget season.

1087
01:26:40,257 --> 01:26:46,499
[SPEAKER_11]: I think three months has been appropriate, and I'm starting to get calls, people asking me about what's going on.

1088
01:26:46,859 --> 01:26:48,660
[SPEAKER_11]: We still haven't heard anything from the budget director.

1089
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:54,122
[SPEAKER_11]: I've swapped emails with her, but we're still waiting for something formal that we can see.

1090
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:59,251
[SPEAKER_11]: when we go into the actual budget, it's not, we're not seeing it for the first time.

1091
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:03,173
[SPEAKER_11]: So we should be working together here and I'd like some sort of response.

1092
01:27:03,753 --> 01:27:07,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, so if we could get a response back from the budget director or from the mayor, I'd greatly appreciate it.

1093
01:27:09,355 --> 01:27:16,078
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of council Falco to request, uh, for a second time, a template process for the budget.

1094
01:27:16,438 --> 01:27:24,061
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor of those opposed motion carries the records of the previous meeting, uh, which I mentioned before,

1095
01:27:24,614 --> 01:27:26,815
[SPEAKER_06]: are now before us, Madam Vice President.

1096
01:27:26,855 --> 01:27:29,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, before you call the records, one more question if we could.

1097
01:27:29,735 --> 01:27:31,276
[SPEAKER_06]: One more, Madam Vice President.

1098
01:27:31,316 --> 01:27:31,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1099
01:27:33,176 --> 01:27:37,698
[SPEAKER_09]: With regards to, there's a petition going around on change.org.

1100
01:27:37,718 --> 01:27:40,198
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there's a number of parents that are working on a petition.

1101
01:27:40,258 --> 01:27:53,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to question, I know the superintendent's contract is up June 2017, which is about a year from now, and a number of people have questions and concerns with regards to transition, creating a search committee,

1102
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,841
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the school committee has discussed it.

1103
01:27:56,861 --> 01:28:01,004
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just not sure what the discussions were because, again, I think it was an executive session.

1104
01:28:01,604 --> 01:28:07,708
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've got a number of calls from personnel and from a number of concerned parents.

1105
01:28:07,808 --> 01:28:18,255
[SPEAKER_09]: And one thing that I was told was there are terms in the contract which mandate that the school committee do take a vote by the end of June.

1106
01:28:18,395 --> 01:28:21,177
[SPEAKER_09]: So if there's any way that the city solicitor or

1107
01:28:22,282 --> 01:28:28,743
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee's attorney, Howard, I believe it's Greenspan, can get us a copy of that contract so that we could take a look.

1108
01:28:29,244 --> 01:28:36,025
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's obviously a very important issue for the taxpayers and the parents.

1109
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:40,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Parents obviously have a big say.

1110
01:28:40,766 --> 01:28:46,127
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a big issue that's come about and a lot of people are talking about it.

1111
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:49,528
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to get a copy of that contract just to take a read of it.

1112
01:28:50,483 --> 01:28:53,345
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Langley-Curran, Councilor Nights.

1113
01:28:53,745 --> 01:28:57,587
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, yes, I'd certainly like to take a look at that contract too.

1114
01:28:58,488 --> 01:29:07,874
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Mr. Bellson's been a fixture in this community for so many years and he does an excellent job in his endeavors, Mr. President, and we're very lucky to have him.

1115
01:29:08,694 --> 01:29:16,119
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at the salary of our superintendent versus those and people in surrounding communities, you'll see that we're getting them at bargain prices, Mr. President.

1116
01:29:16,179 --> 01:29:18,240
[SPEAKER_05]: So I certainly would be

1117
01:29:19,205 --> 01:29:21,406
[SPEAKER_05]: welcoming an opportunity to review the contract as well.

1118
01:29:21,526 --> 01:29:28,610
[SPEAKER_05]: However, I do want to be sure that we take the appropriate steps to protect our bargaining position at the table and our negotiating position at the table as well, Mr. President.

1119
01:29:28,630 --> 01:29:30,892
[SPEAKER_05]: So, going forward, I just want to be cautious in that regard.

1120
01:29:31,512 --> 01:29:33,933
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Vice President Langel-Kern, all those in favor?

1121
01:29:33,953 --> 01:29:34,354
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1122
01:29:34,954 --> 01:29:35,814
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1123
01:29:35,914 --> 01:29:37,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark me as in opposition, Mr. Clerk.

1124
01:29:37,575 --> 01:29:38,256
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion carries.

1125
01:29:39,276 --> 01:29:45,380
[SPEAKER_06]: The records of the meeting of April 12, 2016 will pass to Vice President Langel-Kern.

1126
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,801
[SPEAKER_09]: I motion to table the records so I could take one more look at them.

1127
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:52,967
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Langel-Kern to table the records for further examination.

1128
01:29:53,047 --> 01:29:53,808
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1129
01:29:54,169 --> 01:29:54,970
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1130
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:57,694
[SPEAKER_06]: The records of that meeting remain on the table.

1131
01:29:57,754 --> 01:30:00,017
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Falco to adjourn.

1132
01:30:01,059 --> 01:30:01,780
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1133
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:02,401
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1134
01:30:02,861 --> 01:30:03,462
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion carries.

1135
01:30:03,562 --> 01:30:04,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, America.
