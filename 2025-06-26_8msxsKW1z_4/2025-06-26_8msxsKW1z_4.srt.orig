00:00:00,793 --> 00:00:01,714
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Amanda.

2
00:00:02,475 --> 00:00:06,138
[SPEAKER_30]: Good evening and welcome to tonight's meeting of the community development board.

3
00:00:06,459 --> 00:00:07,500
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll call the meeting to order.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,563
[SPEAKER_30]: Let's begin with some procedural matters.

5
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:17,626
[SPEAKER_30]: First, I want to read that this hearing of the Metro Community Development Board has been conducted via remote means.

[SPEAKER_30]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

26
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:40,277
[SPEAKER_30]: Amanda, can you please introduce any city staff on the call?

27
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:42,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure thing.

28
00:01:43,483 --> 00:01:45,063
[SPEAKER_03]: So my name is Amanda Centrella.

29
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:48,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a staff planner in the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

30
00:01:50,364 --> 00:01:59,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Other city staff that are present tonight include the director of our office, Alicia Hunt, as well as senior planner, Danielle Evans.

31
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,127
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Amanda.

32
00:02:05,227 --> 00:02:11,688
[SPEAKER_30]: So the first item on our agenda tonight is a special permit for the drive-thru use at 3850 Misty Valley Parkway.

33
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:13,269
[SPEAKER_30]: which is Bank of America.

34
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,693
[SPEAKER_30]: It's been, it's been continued from August 16th, uh, 23.

35
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:27,262
[SPEAKER_30]: Just to give an overview, the applicant is applying for a special permit for a drive-thru ATM at 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is in the Wiggins Plaza.

36
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:33,768
[SPEAKER_30]: The special permit grant in authority is the city council, and it has been referred to the seating board for the board's recommendations on the matter.

37
00:02:34,168 --> 00:02:35,910
[SPEAKER_30]: The applicant is advised to present to the board.

38
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:50,378
[SPEAKER_30]: An overall summary actually is that the existing site currently houses a surface parking lot and is bounded by commercial properties to the north, Linden Street to the east, Locust Street to the west, and a northern access drive to Meadow Glen to the south.

39
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:59,742
[SPEAKER_30]: The proposed project will construct an approximately 5,413 square foot bank with one drive-thru lane and one drive-thru bypass lane.

40
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:06,453
[SPEAKER_30]: Amanda, can you introduce all members in representation of Bank of America?

41
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:08,035
[SPEAKER_30]: Absolutely.

42
00:03:08,135 --> 00:03:14,099
[SPEAKER_03]: So I believe William Lucas, the civil engineer for the project, is on the call.

43
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,805
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe Andy Fitz, the project expediter, is on the call as well.

44
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:26,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Bill, I'm actually having a hard time finding Andy in the participants queue.

45
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:32,314
[SPEAKER_03]: If Andy's under a different name, just let me know.

46
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:37,597
[SPEAKER_03]: But you should have full permission to share your screen and unmute yourself and present.

47
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

48
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

49
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:49,384
[SPEAKER_08]: And just to confirm, is everybody seeing on screen now the Bank of America?

50
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:52,066
[SPEAKER_08]: It's blue, red, white, and blue?

51
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:52,146
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

52
00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:52,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

53
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Jackie, thanks for the introduction.

54
00:03:58,127 --> 00:03:59,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening, board members.

55
00:04:00,988 --> 00:04:02,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Bill Lucas of Bowler.

56
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,630
[SPEAKER_08]: We are the civil engineer of record.

57
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:13,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Andy may be on the call, but I will be handling the majority of the conversation and presentation tonight.

58
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:19,198
[SPEAKER_08]: If there's anything in particular that Andy needs to be involved with, I'm sure he'll chime in when the time is right.

59
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:35,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, as Jackie had noted, Bank of America, we've been in front of this board before and what we've heard is a variety of comments about our previous development and concerns with location of the building itself.

60
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:44,825
[SPEAKER_08]: To back everybody up, what you see in a purple outline is the overall property itself, the Meadow Glen Mall.

61
00:04:46,306 --> 00:04:56,215
[SPEAKER_08]: In the lower right-hand corner of the screen in red, we identify the actual project area which is part of the overall mall property.

62
00:04:57,307 --> 00:05:21,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Zooming in, again, what you see from an aerial view is an existing paved parking lot with very little vegetation, an access point onto Locust Street on the lower left-hand side of the site, and then access to the main drive aisle on your right-hand side, which heads up towards the existing marshals.

63
00:05:23,227 --> 00:05:38,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Today, this is what we've presented to the board is in orange, that rectangular shape near the bottom left-hand corner is the new proposed location for the Bank of America.

64
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:43,108
[SPEAKER_08]: It has in the middle along locus a

65
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:57,274
[SPEAKER_08]: full movement driveway in and out to the site itself, as well as you can gain access from the existing driveway that heads towards the Marshalls and you can make a left-hand turn.

66
00:05:57,414 --> 00:06:00,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, full movement driveway in that location.

67
00:06:00,996 --> 00:06:12,124
[SPEAKER_08]: The newest component of this is the exiting movement or exit-only movement from the drive-through component of the bank itself on to Logan Street.

68
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:25,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a image from the architect that provides a good view from Locust Street itself minus all the landscaping that we're presenting.

69
00:06:28,227 --> 00:06:37,530
[SPEAKER_08]: One-story building, front door very close to public sidewalk, bicycle rack, and pedestrian access around the building itself.

70
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,915
[SPEAKER_08]: ADA vehicular parking will be provided on the right-hand side of the building.

71
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:52,623
[SPEAKER_08]: As we rotate around a little bit, you'll get a feel for the drive-through on the left-hand side of the building and another angle of it.

72
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:56,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Pedestrian.

73
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,700
[SPEAKER_08]: exhibit here.

74
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:17,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, we're utilizing some of the existing sidewalk along Locust Street and the sidewalk that heads up towards Meadow Glen Mall, but we have now introduced some more sidewalk along the right-hand side of the building, which allows you to enter the building

75
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:27,057
[SPEAKER_08]: walk to any of the pedestrian accessible parking spaces and along to the parking in the rear.

76
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:41,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Then again, the newest feature is this pocket park at the corner where we'll get to that in a little bit, where we show some upgrades to landscaping as this was, again, a sea of asphalt out here.

77
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,309
[SPEAKER_08]: We really tried to

78
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:50,152
[SPEAKER_08]: enhance the image of this site along the corridor itself.

79
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:58,375
[SPEAKER_08]: We had heard comments about fire protection of the site.

80
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:12,180
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're showing here in this gray swath is the largest vehicle that Medford provided to us and showing that we have access to all sides of the building with no issue.

81
00:08:13,432 --> 00:08:26,411
[SPEAKER_08]: And then as well, again, through the remainder of the site, truck turning with no issue should be able to provide upgraded safety to this area for any emergency situation.

82
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,422
[SPEAKER_08]: In general, that is the presentation itself.

83
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:35,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I don't want to get into too much of the details.

84
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:55,235
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've gone over a lot of that in the past, but I'll open it up for questions and leave you with this image where you can see some of those upgrades to the landscaping itself, where the trees are located along the back, along the front of the property, and then this enhanced pocket park with seating elements involved.

85
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:02,695
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Mr. Lucas.

86
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:03,996
[SPEAKER_30]: I appreciate it.

87
00:09:05,277 --> 00:09:30,758
[SPEAKER_30]: Before I get into questions and open up the questions, I want to see if the city wanted to address, I know that there was some comments from the department heads that you had referenced, and I didn't know if there were anyone from the fire department or from the DPW engineering for the city that would be on, or if the PDS staff is willing to give us a background on some of the concerns that were highlighted before.

88
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:40,790
[SPEAKER_30]: Danielle or Alicia?

89
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:47,853
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.

90
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:50,134
[SPEAKER_32]: This is Danielle Evans, senior planner.

91
00:09:52,316 --> 00:10:05,262
[SPEAKER_32]: I did go over this briefly with Todd and Owen, but with the holiday, I'm not able to get updated comments or a comment letter from either of them.

92
00:10:07,784 --> 00:10:09,885
[SPEAKER_32]: because I think these came in like Thursday evening.

93
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:22,991
[SPEAKER_32]: So I'm not sure where they stand on this.

94
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:26,633
[SPEAKER_32]: Alicia or Amanda, do you have more information about that?

95
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:33,877
[SPEAKER_21]: I wasn't able to, did not talk to our city engineer about this.

96
00:10:36,590 --> 00:11:01,878
[SPEAKER_30]: So for me, anyways, there were some significant changes to the actual proposal, but at the same time, there were substantive concerns and comments from the fire chief, as well as DPW engineering and PDS staff that I think for my own standing on the board, I would need to further hash out before I could even provide

97
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:07,360
[SPEAKER_30]: a recommendation to move forward, or even a ruling at this point.

98
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,322
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know how the city would want me to handle that.

99
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,384
[SPEAKER_30]: And I don't know how the other board members feel about that.

100
00:11:14,984 --> 00:11:23,549
[SPEAKER_30]: I just, without, in the absence of knowing if things have been satisfied with the department heads, I wouldn't know how to move forward.

101
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,191
[SPEAKER_30]: Not even with conditions.

102
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:31,014
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the chair?

103
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:32,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

104
00:11:33,816 --> 00:11:38,358
[SPEAKER_03]: And Danielle or Alicia, feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken.

105
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:55,607
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think when this proposal first came to the board, the staff from the departments that you listed, fire, engineering, and our office as well, had some big concerns about what was being proposed.

106
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:58,068
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result of that,

107
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:01,929
[SPEAKER_03]: The applicant, we met with them multiple times.

108
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:15,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is actually the outcome after several subsequent conversations with staff and with our office, I should say in particular, to kind of address those concerns.

109
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:22,434
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think we can't answer to is this proposal.

110
00:12:22,454 --> 00:12:27,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if this proposal has had eyes on it by engineering and

111
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:28,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Um.

112
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,120
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, fire, um, at this point.

113
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:50,223
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will say that as far as fire, I think there is 360 degree access, um, around the, the building, which was sort of the main concern that is, um, that the chief had mentioned in the past.

114
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:59,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and they showed the, um, the auto turn radius, um, in one of the previous slides, I believe, to kind of accounting for that.

115
00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that feel like a reasonable summary, Danielle?

116
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:09,087
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, and it can always be a condition that

117
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:23,281
[SPEAKER_32]: or the special permit is conditioned on meeting all of the fire chief's requirements, which I think it does.

118
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:40,376
[SPEAKER_32]: The one thing that the engineering department had brought up, and it looks like it was remedied on the plan, was the aprons to the drives, that the sidewalk, it had to go up, and then it had to be the sidewalk, and then go in.

119
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:49,389
[SPEAKER_32]: It looks like that was, I think that was corrected or.

120
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,653
[SPEAKER_32]: It appears to be so.

121
00:13:57,875 --> 00:14:01,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Daniel, I, we did correct that.

122
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:04,680
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see the new.

123
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:10,676
[SPEAKER_08]: driveway entries all in concrete as requested previously.

124
00:14:11,256 --> 00:14:35,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Our office had met with Owen between the two meetings to discuss the drainage aspect for this site as well, considering that now we need to look at the entire piece of property since we're relocating the building and we just wanted to ensure that our approach would be consistent with what he was thinking.

125
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:45,734
[SPEAKER_08]: and how we would then handle any future development that could potentially happen at the rear of the site.

126
00:14:46,894 --> 00:15:01,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Generally speaking, again, we need to fine-tune the design and turn that into him for review, but we were going to stick with the design that we had in place as long as we could meet

127
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:08,187
[SPEAKER_08]: grade elevations through it because it handles the bank fairly well.

128
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:15,979
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we would indicate on our drawings any kind of future systems that would be separate from our system.

129
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:16,520
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't want to

130
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:23,929
[SPEAKER_08]: design one entire system to handle a site that we didn't know what it was going to be in the future.

131
00:15:24,029 --> 00:15:37,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So we will provide an underground system for the bank, and then we will provide a space and a rough layout for where the future underground system could be.

132
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:54,295
[SPEAKER_21]: So can I just, I was just confirming with our staff.

133
00:15:54,555 --> 00:16:05,024
[SPEAKER_21]: So we got these from the applicant on the 31st and it went to engineering and traffic and transportation on the 31st, correct?

134
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:12,891
[SPEAKER_21]: So it went to them last week?

135
00:16:15,313 --> 00:16:16,694
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that question directed to me?

136
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:18,835
[SPEAKER_21]: To you and Amanda?

137
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:22,122
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody made sure that they saw these.

138
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:26,683
[SPEAKER_21]: I did not send anything.

139
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:37,065
[SPEAKER_32]: There was the plan that didn't have the landscaping detail that I know for sure that they saw.

140
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:47,367
[SPEAKER_21]: And I was actually wondering, so there's a letter, a response letter that seems to be actually in the files.

141
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:49,567
[SPEAKER_21]: It's directed to DPW Engineering.

142
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,602
[SPEAKER_21]: That responds point by point by their requests.

143
00:16:59,465 --> 00:17:01,949
[SPEAKER_30]: And I do have that, but I don't have.

144
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,493
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out.

145
00:17:06,074 --> 00:17:08,377
[SPEAKER_21]: So, maybe the question is to the applicant.

146
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:12,248
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it's addressed to the Department of Public Works.

147
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:18,593
[SPEAKER_21]: Did it only come to our office or did you also send it to the Department of Public Works?

148
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:20,194
[SPEAKER_21]: Just because I see it's addressed to them.

149
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:24,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we submitted it to both locations.

150
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,199
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

151
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:35,907
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have to confirm with administrative staff at my office that everybody received it.

152
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:49,985
[SPEAKER_30]: If you don't mind, I'm going to open it up to the board if there's any clarifying questions from the board.

153
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:53,185
[SPEAKER_30]: So that's not just my voice on this.

154
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:01,788
[SPEAKER_30]: Do any board members have any clarifying questions?

155
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:04,969
[SPEAKER_30]: Concerns or comments?

156
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,650
[SPEAKER_29]: I have a question.

157
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,290
Yes.

158
00:18:10,011 --> 00:18:14,012
[SPEAKER_29]: So for this diagram, I'm understanding that we're going to be

159
00:18:16,438 --> 00:18:19,139
[SPEAKER_29]: greening up some previously paved space.

160
00:18:19,219 --> 00:18:19,920
[SPEAKER_29]: Is that correct?

161
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:22,121
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

162
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:23,701
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

163
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:28,204
[SPEAKER_29]: What's the programming for this space, or is it just like an open, empty field?

164
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:32,205
[SPEAKER_08]: At this time, it's an open, empty field.

165
00:18:32,966 --> 00:18:34,487
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

166
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:38,869
[SPEAKER_29]: How close is this to the little nugget of a dog park that's in that area?

167
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:41,550
[SPEAKER_08]: It is immediately adjacent.

168
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,871
[SPEAKER_08]: That dog park is in the upper right-hand corner.

169
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:46,112
[SPEAKER_29]: That's very interesting.

170
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:50,264
[SPEAKER_29]: Do you own both parcels?

171
00:18:52,124 --> 00:18:53,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe it is.

172
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:56,286
[SPEAKER_29]: Does the applicant own both parcels?

173
00:18:57,026 --> 00:19:03,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the landlord may own a piece of that and then maybe city owned with the road.

174
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:04,790
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

175
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:05,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Linden Street.

176
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:09,632
[SPEAKER_08]: It is not on this project site.

177
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:10,712
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

178
00:19:10,752 --> 00:19:16,335
[SPEAKER_29]: I'd be really interested in how that beautiful green open space can potentially be programmed.

179
00:19:17,268 --> 00:19:36,204
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, it feels like an opportunity for the site, um, whether it's an extension of a dog park or, you know, picnic benches for the employees of that plaza, um, just to give it like a little bit of purpose, I think would be a really interesting opportunity.

180
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:43,290
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm not sure if we can condition around those, those suggestions, but, um, that's something that I noticed and, um,

181
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:46,369
[SPEAKER_29]: I do want to say I really appreciate the pocket park in the front.

182
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:47,891
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that's a gorgeous addition.

183
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:51,774
[SPEAKER_29]: I also like how you've brought the bank to the edge of the street.

184
00:19:51,794 --> 00:20:03,664
[SPEAKER_29]: I think those are two really great moves, so I commend you for those, and I would love to see, you know, some sort of programming for this, you know, the big green lot that's resulting.

185
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:10,950
[SPEAKER_29]: That's all I have.

186
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,051
[SPEAKER_29]: Thanks, Jackie.

187
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:13,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, the chair.

188
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:14,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

189
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:23,033
[SPEAKER_03]: I just noticed that I believe the representative for the project landlord, Jane Benefield has their hand raised.

190
00:20:23,794 --> 00:20:25,855
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, yes, please go right ahead.

191
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:26,615
[SPEAKER_30]: Miss Benefield.

192
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:42,362
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to let you all know, because I don't think you you are currently aware that the anchor tenants at this

193
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:46,855
[SPEAKER_12]: shopping center have approval rights over the parking lot.

194
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:59,102
[SPEAKER_12]: And because the parking was, we already got the approvals from all of the anchors when the previous plan was completed.

195
00:20:59,122 --> 00:21:08,408
[SPEAKER_12]: And now I'm having to go back and I'm getting pushed back because so many parking spaces were removed.

196
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:12,390
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know that we'll be able to get

197
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:13,916
[SPEAKER_12]: the approvals.

198
00:21:14,617 --> 00:21:20,300
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm in, I'm currently in the middle of trying to secure them.

199
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:30,867
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I'm getting a lot of questions and, you know, that I, you know, I can't really, I can't really respond to.

200
00:21:31,676 --> 00:21:37,523
[SPEAKER_12]: So they have approval over our entire parking lot and how many parking spaces we have.

201
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:45,412
[SPEAKER_12]: And so to remove 142 of them, which is 12.8%, is a lot.

202
00:21:45,952 --> 00:21:52,039
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just letting you know that without those approvals, this project can't move forward.

203
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:55,889
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you for adding that.

204
00:21:55,909 --> 00:22:08,536
[SPEAKER_30]: That was 1 of the questions that I was actually going to raise to the PDF staff is because within the response to the PDFs, there was questions about parking and I saw there the response from the model.

205
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:17,895
[SPEAKER_30]: landlord stating that it must meet the parking requirements for various lease on site.

206
00:22:17,955 --> 00:22:22,717
[SPEAKER_30]: Not only that, lease restrictions and parking changes will have to be the approval of all tenants.

207
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:26,759
[SPEAKER_30]: So I was kind of trying to figure out how that was addressed.

208
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,860
[SPEAKER_30]: And Danielle, if you can please go ahead.

209
00:22:31,161 --> 00:22:32,001
[SPEAKER_30]: I see you have your hand up.

210
00:22:32,702 --> 00:22:33,882
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, so thank you.

211
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:34,322
[SPEAKER_32]: So when

212
00:22:39,322 --> 00:22:48,444
[SPEAKER_32]: The permit expeditors were telling us that there were certain restrictions or buffer areas and that they were recorded in the Registry of Deeds.

213
00:22:48,484 --> 00:23:02,646
[SPEAKER_32]: So I looked at the Wegmans lease, the Marshalls lease, and the only thing that I saw that was recorded was this 200 foot, I think it was 200 feet buffer.

214
00:23:03,026 --> 00:23:06,927
[SPEAKER_32]: So it kind of clips that top corner.

215
00:23:08,506 --> 00:23:16,204
[SPEAKER_32]: But I didn't and I saw that there was like veto power or there were certain uses that weren't allowed like restaurants and liquor stores and.

216
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:22,108
[SPEAKER_32]: different uses, but I didn't see anything about the parking.

217
00:23:22,188 --> 00:23:29,373
[SPEAKER_32]: And also I would like to stress that tenants and even property owners can override zoning.

218
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:33,776
[SPEAKER_32]: This is their non-conforming property.

219
00:23:33,836 --> 00:23:34,617
[SPEAKER_32]: It's over-parked.

220
00:23:35,637 --> 00:23:37,058
[SPEAKER_32]: They have more than enough parking.

221
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:39,720
[SPEAKER_32]: This parking lot is often empty.

222
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:43,523
[SPEAKER_32]: I know that there's leasing of spaces.

223
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,364
[SPEAKER_32]: I've seen vans parked there.

224
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:52,009
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm really incredulous about how Wegmans thinks that we need the spaces.

225
00:23:52,710 --> 00:24:01,596
[SPEAKER_29]: Question though, regardless of any of that, if the applicant is telling us that this plan isn't even approved, why are we even talking about it?

226
00:24:02,797 --> 00:24:04,339
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, we just found this out as well.

227
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:04,699
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

228
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,263
[SPEAKER_29]: So then maybe we make a motion to postpone this to the next meeting.

229
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:18,008
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I would tend to agree with that if we're saying- Yeah, I don't want to waste time on this if it's not a done deal.

230
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:25,731
[SPEAKER_32]: Just relaying to the property owner or property manager that- Yeah.

231
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:28,633
[SPEAKER_32]: Wigman's thinking they don't have enough spaces.

232
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:33,095
[SPEAKER_29]: Regardless, Danielle, if they're telling us, if Ms.

233
00:24:33,135 --> 00:24:38,257
[SPEAKER_29]: Benefield is telling us that she doesn't even know if this property is approved, I don't care.

234
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:41,198
[SPEAKER_29]: I want them to come to us with something that they're confident with.

235
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:45,149
[SPEAKER_29]: And if they're not, then we have a lot of stuff to talk about tonight.

236
00:24:45,689 --> 00:24:55,074
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm going to go ahead and make a motion to postpone this discussion to the next development meeting, which I believe is the 20th.

237
00:24:56,675 --> 00:24:57,716
[SPEAKER_33]: I second that motion.

238
00:25:01,938 --> 00:25:04,700
[SPEAKER_29]: Do I call the vote?

239
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,760
[SPEAKER_29]: Or does Jackie?

240
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:09,723
[SPEAKER_30]: The clerk can call the vote, which is Peter, but I can

241
00:25:11,412 --> 00:25:13,114
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

242
00:25:13,954 --> 00:25:14,575
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yeah.

243
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:22,380
[SPEAKER_30]: But I would still, I believe you'd have to do the whole call attendance because you probably don't have that readily available.

244
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,401
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, you're correct.

245
00:25:23,441 --> 00:25:25,862
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't have that in front of me.

246
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:28,424
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

247
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:28,844
[SPEAKER_30]: Sorry.

248
00:25:30,866 --> 00:25:31,266
[SPEAKER_30]: It's here.

249
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:33,668
[SPEAKER_30]: Vice-chair Emily Hedeman?

250
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:34,768
[SPEAKER_30]: Aye.

251
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,150
[SPEAKER_30]: Peter Cowles?

252
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:38,411
[SPEAKER_27]: Aye.

253
00:25:40,714 --> 00:25:41,415
[SPEAKER_30]: Ari Fishman.

254
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:43,216
[SPEAKER_30]: Aye.

255
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:45,798
[SPEAKER_30]: Pam Mariansky.

256
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:46,699
Aye.

257
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,801
[SPEAKER_30]: Chirag Bachariya.

258
00:25:50,642 --> 00:25:50,742
[SPEAKER_33]: Aye.

259
00:25:51,362 --> 00:25:52,784
[SPEAKER_30]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

260
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:53,304
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm an aye.

261
00:25:55,846 --> 00:26:01,230
[SPEAKER_30]: We will discuss the special commit drive through use of 3815 Mystic Valley Parkway.

262
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,592
[SPEAKER_30]: The proponent of Bank of America will be continuing to 9-2023.

263
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:04,173
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you guys.

264
00:26:04,213 --> 00:26:04,453
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

265
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:12,787
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

266
00:26:17,855 --> 00:26:24,186
[SPEAKER_30]: Our next item on the list is a plan development unit at 1 to 20 Waltham Court.

267
00:26:25,468 --> 00:26:26,670
[SPEAKER_30]: Let me read the public hearing.

268
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:39,091
[SPEAKER_30]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on September 6, 2023 at the 6.30 p.m.

269
00:26:39,131 --> 00:26:52,839
[SPEAKER_30]: via Zoom video conferencing relative to a petition by the Medford Housing Authority to amend the zoning map, City of Medford map dated April 13, 1965 as referenced in Medford Zoning Ordinance Chapter 94

270
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,300
[SPEAKER_30]: dash 2.2.

271
00:26:55,581 --> 00:27:20,941
[SPEAKER_30]: The amendment proposes to change the zoning district designation of the property one to 20 Waukland Court as depicted on sheets one to six of the plans entitled ALTA slash NSPS land title survey prepared by Fuston O'Neill and dated February 6, 2022 from apartment one zoning district to a planned development district PDD, which would have new development standards per Metro zoning ordinance chapters 94,

272
00:27:22,565 --> 00:27:23,225
[SPEAKER_30]: dash 9.2.3.

273
00:27:23,986 --> 00:27:39,276
[SPEAKER_30]: The full materials for the amendment can be viewed in the office of planning and office, office of planning, development and sustainability on the, on the, on the, on their website under current CD board files.

274
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:51,224
[SPEAKER_30]: So Amanda, would you please introduce anyone that's here for

275
00:27:52,223 --> 00:27:53,164
[SPEAKER_30]: Method Housing Authority?

276
00:27:54,745 --> 00:27:55,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

277
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,427
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple of things first.

278
00:27:57,527 --> 00:28:06,953
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as a reminder to the board and to any members of the public, the plan development district process is a three phase process.

279
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:12,657
[SPEAKER_03]: This is sort of the first phase and the first phase revolves around drafting of zoning.

280
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:15,839
[SPEAKER_03]: So a zoning amendment for the site in question.

281
00:28:18,257 --> 00:28:26,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And with us tonight, and this is for the board's benefit, is Attorney Jonathan Silverstein of BBHS Law.

282
00:28:27,224 --> 00:28:29,726
[SPEAKER_03]: He's here to provide the board with legal support.

283
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:38,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have questions about the process or the language being proposed or anything like that, please feel free to ask Jonathan.

284
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:49,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, I may turn the hand over the baton to the Medford Housing Authority team.

285
00:28:51,446 --> 00:28:56,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe I gave most, if not all of you permissions, but if not, feel free to raise your hand.

286
00:28:56,932 --> 00:28:59,314
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Amanda.

287
00:28:59,434 --> 00:29:01,617
[SPEAKER_14]: Natalie, do you have the ability to pull up the?

288
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:03,983
[SPEAKER_14]: Presentation.

00:29:04,324 --> 00:29:04,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

00:29:05,565 --> 00:29:06,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:06,505
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody.

292
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:09,627
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for meeting with us this evening.

293
00:29:10,328 --> 00:29:11,308
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Gabriel.

294
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:16,052
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the director of modernization and procurement with the Medford housing authority.

295
00:29:17,052 --> 00:29:24,057
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're here tonight discussing our plan development district application for the redevelopment of walk in court.

296
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:28,765
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here right now representing the Medford Housing Authority.

297
00:29:29,665 --> 00:29:37,609
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Natalie Janssen and Margaret Donnelly-Moran representing us from the Cambridge Housing Authority.

298
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:40,931
[SPEAKER_13]: They are acting as our development consultant with this project.

299
00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:53,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Our counsel for this project, we have Hannah Kilson with Nolan Sheehan Patton, and then our architect and designer, Dietzen Company, is with us this evening.

300
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:04,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Danny Garba, Leticia, and I'm sorry, is Lee on the call?

301
00:30:05,256 --> 00:30:05,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm here.

302
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:06,617
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't see everybody.

303
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:10,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Lee Morrissette is on with us.

304
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:12,682
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have Kevin Garvey.

305
00:30:13,983 --> 00:30:24,232
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and Fuston O'Neill, who has assisted with this application for the civil work is with us.

306
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:29,909
[SPEAKER_13]: This evening, I'm going to be turning it over to Natalie Jansen in a few minutes.

307
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:50,662
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to go through the overview of the Walkland Court development, the existing conditions, the why we are doing this, the proposed PDD process, our requested zoning amendment, and then we'll leave it open for questions and comments to the board and the general public.

308
00:30:52,122 --> 00:30:53,763
[SPEAKER_13]: At this time, I'm going to turn it over to Natalie.

309
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:57,191
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening.

310
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:58,773
[SPEAKER_18]: My name's Natalie Jansen.

311
00:30:58,893 --> 00:31:00,834
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm with the Cambridge Housing Authority.

312
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:02,816
[SPEAKER_18]: As.

313
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,162
[SPEAKER_17]: Just mention.

314
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:16,706
[SPEAKER_17]: Working and.

315
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:22,890
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry for the read about.

316
00:31:26,182 --> 00:31:28,523
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm sorry, Natalie, I think your audio is going in and out.

317
00:31:28,863 --> 00:31:29,123
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

318
00:31:31,364 --> 00:31:36,366
[SPEAKER_29]: Sometimes if you turn off video of you, it helps with the bandwidth.

319
00:31:38,447 --> 00:31:39,267
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you hear me now?

320
00:31:40,508 --> 00:31:40,788
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

321
00:31:41,148 --> 00:31:41,388
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

322
00:31:41,808 --> 00:31:43,949
[SPEAKER_18]: That's also I'm speaking a little bit louder.

323
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:45,249
[SPEAKER_18]: So that should be better.

324
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:46,950
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

325
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,171
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me know if there are any further issues.

326
00:31:51,148 --> 00:32:04,029
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I just wanted to start off by saying that we understand that the focus for tonight's hearing is to review the proposed zoning amendment that would allow for the redevelopment of walk link court.

327
00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:14,471
[SPEAKER_18]: in such a manner that would enable the MHA to finance and construct affordable housing on site for elders, disabled residents and families.

328
00:32:15,172 --> 00:32:26,681
[SPEAKER_18]: And in such a way that is consistent with the Medford housing production plan, and the city of Medford comprehensive plans goals to increase the number of affordable housing in the city.

329
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:41,096
[SPEAKER_18]: But before we go into the proposed zoning amendment, I just wanted to give an overview of the current Wackling Court site, as well as the proposed redevelopment project.

330
00:32:42,897 --> 00:32:47,099
[SPEAKER_18]: Wackling Court is owned and operated by the Medford Housing Authority.

331
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:54,983
[SPEAKER_18]: Currently on site, there are 144 state public housing units for seniors and residents with disabilities.

332
00:32:56,049 --> 00:32:59,252
[SPEAKER_18]: All of these units are deeply affordable.

333
00:32:59,672 --> 00:33:05,357
[SPEAKER_18]: That means that tenant rents is limited to 30% of the household's income.

334
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:10,342
[SPEAKER_18]: The property suffers of two main issues.

335
00:33:10,942 --> 00:33:14,545
[SPEAKER_18]: One is that it is in very poor physical condition.

336
00:33:15,306 --> 00:33:17,268
[SPEAKER_18]: It was built in 1963.

337
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:22,793
[SPEAKER_18]: And in the 60 years that it's been there, it has not been comprehensively modernized.

338
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:32,479
[SPEAKER_18]: Secondly, it lacks accessibility features needed to adequately serve a senior and disabled population.

339
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:37,040
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can see in the picture, there are nine buildings.

340
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,880
[SPEAKER_18]: There are two stories.

341
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,381
[SPEAKER_18]: Half of the 144 units are located on the second floor.

342
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,002
[SPEAKER_18]: There are no elevators, meaning that

343
00:33:47,002 --> 00:33:55,105
[SPEAKER_18]: um, elders and residents with disabilities can only access their units by stairs, which can be very difficult.

344
00:33:57,286 --> 00:34:06,310
[SPEAKER_18]: So given the obsolescence of the site, the Medford Housing Authority started a pre-development process for Wokling in January 2020.

345
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:14,373
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, that kicked off with a feasibility study that essentially determined that

346
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:28,441
[SPEAKER_18]: The only way of addressing the poor physical conditions on site, the lack of accessibility, and other concerns such as energy inefficiency and noise transmission was to redevelop the site.

347
00:34:29,362 --> 00:34:38,545
[SPEAKER_18]: And that providing accessible units with elevator access in a mid-rise for seniors and disabled residents

348
00:34:40,023 --> 00:35:01,900
[SPEAKER_18]: that has on the ground floor adequate community space as well as on-site management and space for resident services was the best way of addressing the needs of the current population at Wakling Court and also allow households to age in place at Wakling.

349
00:35:04,049 --> 00:35:11,193
[SPEAKER_18]: As part of this pre-development process, the MHE met with various city departments to gather input and feedback.

350
00:35:12,053 --> 00:35:21,678
[SPEAKER_31]: We met with the Office of Planning, Development, Sustainability, the Fire Department.

351
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:28,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Natalie, if I may, you're cutting out again.

352
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:38,193
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just going to move a little closer to the router.

353
00:35:38,213 --> 00:35:41,195
[SPEAKER_18]: And that should do it.

354
00:35:50,121 --> 00:35:50,501
[SPEAKER_35]: All right.

355
00:35:53,043 --> 00:35:53,763
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry about that.

356
00:35:53,783 --> 00:35:57,366
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you hear me?

357
00:35:57,386 --> 00:36:00,668
[SPEAKER_18]: Excellent.

358
00:36:04,546 --> 00:36:17,135
[SPEAKER_18]: So the MHA met with the city departments, it also secured a key piece of funding, which is $15 million of competitive funding that it received from the state.

359
00:36:18,236 --> 00:36:26,382
[SPEAKER_18]: And then a procured Dietzen company architects to lead the architectural and engineering team for this project in 2022.

360
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:35,404
[SPEAKER_18]: The MHA also led a very active and well attended resident and neighborhood engagement process.

361
00:36:36,745 --> 00:36:42,466
[SPEAKER_18]: There were seven resident meetings, both to gather input and also keep residents informed.

362
00:36:43,306 --> 00:36:53,188
[SPEAKER_18]: And residents are very eager to see the redevelopment move forward, given the issues on site, the poor physical conditions, as well as lack of access.

363
00:36:54,869 --> 00:37:06,013
[SPEAKER_18]: And in advance of this meeting, the MHA submitted 78 letters of support from residents that are supportive of this plant development district.

364
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:10,115
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition, there were five community meetings.

365
00:37:10,635 --> 00:37:20,459
[SPEAKER_18]: So for these community meetings, the MHA provided notice to households living within 800 feet of the site.

366
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:22,320
[SPEAKER_18]: They also posted flyers

367
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:25,594
[SPEAKER_18]: on telephone poles around the property.

368
00:37:27,994 --> 00:37:31,575
[SPEAKER_18]: And the meetings were held at the Wachling Court community room.

369
00:37:32,855 --> 00:37:38,737
[SPEAKER_18]: There's one of the goals of the redevelopment is to increase the community space at Wachling Court.

370
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:46,599
[SPEAKER_18]: But even though the community meetings were very well attended, there was always space for everyone.

371
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:57,504
[SPEAKER_18]: Walkland Court is located in the hillside neighborhood of Medford.

372
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:09,350
[SPEAKER_18]: It has excellent connection to public transit, both the Tufts stop on the Green Line, the West Medford commuter rail, and buses along Boston Avenue.

373
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:23,169
[SPEAKER_18]: It also is in close proximity to recreational activities along the Mystic River, the grocery store that's just west to the site, as well as other commercial activities on Boston Ave.

374
00:38:25,211 --> 00:38:34,496
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the key defining characteristics of the site is that it abuts very different conditions and uses on different parts of the site.

375
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:48,780
[SPEAKER_18]: So to the north and the east along North Street and Auburn Street is a contiguous residential neighborhood of two stories that are single family homes or duplexes.

376
00:38:50,402 --> 00:39:00,671
[SPEAKER_18]: To the south of the site, there's MBTA commuter rail line, as well as an industrial district where there are concrete masonry mid-rise office buildings.

377
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:09,062
[SPEAKER_18]: And then to the west of the site, there's a commercial space where there's a grocery store and other residential activities.

378
00:39:15,306 --> 00:39:22,852
[SPEAKER_18]: So the goal of redeveloping Waukland Court consists of a variety of goals.

379
00:39:23,532 --> 00:39:30,377
[SPEAKER_18]: The number one goal is to provide replacement units for the current 144 units that are on site.

380
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:39,826
[SPEAKER_18]: and these units will be redeveloped into high quality accessible and deeply affordable units to existing residents.

381
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:51,453
[SPEAKER_18]: The next goal is to add additional affordable housing on site by building 94 net new deeply affordable housing units in Medford on the site.

382
00:39:52,814 --> 00:39:54,135
[SPEAKER_18]: The redevelopment of this

383
00:39:55,352 --> 00:40:04,496
[SPEAKER_18]: Site also allows an opportunity to improve resiliency and sustainability, which is also important given the fact that it's close to the Mystic River.

384
00:40:04,516 --> 00:40:10,799
[SPEAKER_18]: And we see a real opportunity here to improve the site's connection to the surrounding neighborhood.

385
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:24,785
[SPEAKER_18]: And so the site is designed in such a way to transition smoothly between the residential northern and eastern side to the mid-rise, that's to the south, behind the property.

386
00:40:26,743 --> 00:40:33,549
[SPEAKER_18]: We also just wanted to note that the redevelopment of Walkling Court is consistent with local priorities in Medford.

387
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:52,927
[SPEAKER_18]: So the fiscal year 2021-2025 Medford housing production plan includes the replacement of existing units at Walkling as well as the addition of new units on the site as a strategy to meet the city's affordable housing goals.

388
00:40:54,357 --> 00:41:06,387
[SPEAKER_18]: In addition, the comprehensive plan for 2023, which was approved by city council has a goal of building 600 subsidized units by fiscal year 2025.

389
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:14,274
[SPEAKER_18]: And the 94 net new deeply affordable units that can be built on the site would help meet the city's goal by 15%.

390
00:41:14,354 --> 00:41:20,539
[SPEAKER_18]: Here you can see

391
00:41:22,705 --> 00:41:26,906
[SPEAKER_18]: a site plan of the proposed redevelopment.

392
00:41:27,126 --> 00:41:36,668
[SPEAKER_18]: And so building A, that's to the left by the MBTA railroad is a six-story senior mid-rise with 198 units.

393
00:41:39,408 --> 00:41:43,169
[SPEAKER_18]: The building is located by the MBTA railroad.

394
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:47,730
[SPEAKER_18]: So just wanted to make a note that we have an acoustical engineer on team and

395
00:41:48,856 --> 00:42:05,866
[SPEAKER_18]: We have essentially cited the building in such a way, and also designed the facade, which includes the use of triple-pane windows and additional insulation to meet the noise attenuation requirements that we will have to meet by HUD requirements.

396
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:14,692
[SPEAKER_18]: Building B is a 24-unit family mid-rise of four stories that will be elevator accessible.

397
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:22,168
[SPEAKER_18]: and then building C, E, and D or two-story townhomes with a total of 16 units.

398
00:42:23,531 --> 00:42:26,238
[SPEAKER_18]: And all of these units will be deeply affordable.

399
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:48,983
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, as I mentioned at the top of the meeting, we understand that the purpose of tonight's meeting is to discuss the draft zoning amendment that we submitted for Wackling Court, which is currently zoned as apartment one.

400
00:42:49,443 --> 00:43:01,526
[SPEAKER_18]: And this draft zoning amendment would essentially allow for the replacement of the 144 obsolete units on site and the creation of more affordable housing.

401
00:43:02,766 --> 00:43:03,687
[SPEAKER_18]: at Walkland Court.

402
00:43:06,047 --> 00:43:24,113
[SPEAKER_18]: Throughout the pre-development process, we met with the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, and as part of those meetings, they suggested that we look at the PDD as an option, as I felt that Walkland Court would be a good candidate to go through the PDD process.

403
00:43:25,153 --> 00:43:27,534
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, after consulting with the

404
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:46,253
[SPEAKER_18]: overall development team, the Medford Housing Authority decided to proceed with the PDD application, which it had its official pre-application meeting on August 7, with staff, the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

405
00:43:47,093 --> 00:43:56,315
[SPEAKER_18]: It then submitted the PDD application on August 8, and has been working with attorney Jonathan Silverstein on comments

406
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,962
[SPEAKER_18]: that have been submitted on the PDD-3 zoning amendment.

407
00:44:01,763 --> 00:44:10,268
[SPEAKER_18]: So now I'm going to pass it on to Attorney Hannah Kilson, who's going to go through the draft PDD zoning amendment.

408
00:44:15,484 --> 00:44:16,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Natalie.

409
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:20,508
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to thank the board for making the time for us to come here today.

410
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:22,350
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Hannah Kilson.

411
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:31,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a partner at the firm of Nolan Sheehan Patton, and we represent the Medford Housing Authority in its PDD amendment proposal.

412
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:40,046
[SPEAKER_06]: As Natalie noted, consistent with the requirements provided in the zoning ordinance, the PDD application was submitted.

413
00:44:40,832 --> 00:44:43,153
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, to the board on August 8th, 2023.

414
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:50,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and the proposed PDD amendment would create a planned residential development district.

415
00:44:51,117 --> 00:45:03,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, if there's no objection, Madam Chair, I'm going to go through a quick overview of the amendment, um, that we've been working on with the city and as Natalie noted, um, Attorney Jonathan Silverstein.

416
00:45:04,613 --> 00:45:19,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please proceed right so my understanding is that the board does have it with it the draft amendment showing the final language that we have worked through the 1st piece of the PDD is is the zoning map amendment.

417
00:45:20,312 --> 00:45:34,841
[SPEAKER_06]: We are proposing that a PDD 3 would be established as an overlay district on the parcel of land in Medford that's located at 1 and 3 to 20 Walkling Court and known as Walkling Court.

418
00:45:36,592 --> 00:45:50,641
[SPEAKER_06]: We're seeking approval of this overlay to amend the zoning map to impose this overlay on an area that's currently located in an apartment one district and has been used for low income housing since 1963.

419
00:45:53,523 --> 00:46:03,090
[SPEAKER_06]: You received, as part of the PDD application, a survey and a site plan, and I just want to be clear on locating this parcel again.

420
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:11,277
[SPEAKER_06]: The parcel of Butts North Street at its southeast and across North Street is a general resident district.

421
00:46:12,198 --> 00:46:20,465
[SPEAKER_06]: The parcel of Butts, as Natalie noted, an industrial one district to the south with the MBTA commuter rail,

422
00:46:21,005 --> 00:46:31,127
[SPEAKER_06]: abutting the southern property line, and on the other side of that commuter rail tracks is the Tufts University Center for Engineering, Education, and Outreach.

423
00:46:31,728 --> 00:46:41,010
[SPEAKER_06]: The parcel abuts a commercial one district to its west, and that adjacent parcel is occupied by Whole Foods Market.

424
00:46:42,083 --> 00:46:53,691
[SPEAKER_06]: To the north, northeast and southeast of the parcel is an apartment, one district and the adjacent parcels are a mix of single family to family dwellings.

425
00:46:54,531 --> 00:46:58,874
[SPEAKER_06]: So, with this amendment, the zoning map would be amended to create 3.

426
00:46:59,254 --> 00:46:59,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Danielle.

427
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have something that you're displaying on your screen?

428
00:47:05,974 --> 00:47:06,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I do not.

429
00:47:07,496 --> 00:47:08,457
[SPEAKER_06]: No, not at this point.

430
00:47:08,477 --> 00:47:15,127
[SPEAKER_06]: But Natalie can put up, if you want, the map that she previously showed, which kind of outlayed the survey.

431
00:47:15,147 --> 00:47:15,187
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

432
00:47:16,008 --> 00:47:16,128
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah.

433
00:47:18,931 --> 00:47:28,241
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's just to locate so the 1st request before you will be the amendment of the zoning map to create this PDD 3 overlay district.

434
00:47:29,102 --> 00:47:34,128
[SPEAKER_06]: The next portions of the zoning zoning amendment really deal with general structural provisions.

435
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:37,632
[SPEAKER_06]: They set out the special permit process.

436
00:47:38,212 --> 00:47:52,084
[SPEAKER_06]: under which the city council, acting as the special permit granting authority, would issue a special permit for the project in accordance with section 94-9.2.7 of the zoning ordinance.

437
00:47:53,044 --> 00:48:06,615
[SPEAKER_06]: The amendment then sets out that a site plan review process to be conducted by the board and allows for this site plan review to occur prior to or contemporaneously with the special permit review.

438
00:48:08,891 --> 00:48:22,842
[SPEAKER_06]: The PDD amendment also provides that the special permit requirements of the inclusionary housing provisions of the zoning ordinance will be satisfied by the issuance of the PDD-3 special permit.

439
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:34,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And the PDD-3 project will satisfy the affordability restrictions and regulation requirements of your inclusionary housing provisions in your zoning ordinance.

440
00:48:35,951 --> 00:48:46,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, this will allow all the units that are to be built as part of the walk-in court project to be included in the city's subsidized housing inventory.

441
00:48:48,707 --> 00:48:49,587
[SPEAKER_06]: permitted uses.

442
00:48:49,607 --> 00:48:53,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Natalie, do you want to put that up just so people can visually see that?

443
00:48:53,649 --> 00:48:58,911
[SPEAKER_06]: So the proposed PDD amendment provides that there will be certain uses that are permitted as of right.

444
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:07,654
[SPEAKER_06]: They are the detached single-family dwellings, the attached single-family dwellings, including 2, 3 or more dwelling structures.

445
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:20,237
[SPEAKER_06]: The detached two-family dwelling, multiple dwelling class A and class B would be permitted as of right, as well as senior housing, independent living facility.

446
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:37,102
[SPEAKER_06]: The amendment provides that certain uses would be permitted by special permit issued by the city council, and that would be dormitory fraternity or sorority housing, lodging or boarding housing, and the senior housing facility.

447
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:52,323
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one accessory use that we are also looking to have that the amendment is providing for, and that is that general office use that is accessory to a permitted residential use would be permitted as of right.

448
00:49:53,043 --> 00:50:01,446
[SPEAKER_06]: And this portion of the amendment would allow for the management office to be located within the multifamily dwelling.

449
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:07,267
[SPEAKER_06]: There are no other uses that are being proposed for this PDD.

450
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:14,872
[SPEAKER_06]: The next component of the PDD amendment are the dimensional provisions.

451
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:27,477
[SPEAKER_06]: The proposed PDD amendment would allow for more than one principal structure on the site, similar to the existing condition on the property.

452
00:50:27,497 --> 00:50:37,561
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would be the case provided that each structure is located a distance of at least 15 feet away from any other principal structure.

453
00:50:40,106 --> 00:51:06,673
[SPEAKER_06]: The amendment also and the standards that were proposing in the amendment are really trying to be consistent with the purpose and intent of the PDD provisions of the zoning ordinance and give to Medford Housing the flexibility that it needs in order to redevelop Laughlin Court and to address the affordable housing shortage that exists in Medford at this time.

454
00:51:07,933 --> 00:51:19,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Lock configurations for the PDD 3 lot at the minimum standards here are 35 foot frontage, 35 foot lot width, and a 75 foot depth.

455
00:51:20,736 --> 00:51:25,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Landscaped and usable open space would be 10% of the gross floor area.

456
00:51:27,515 --> 00:51:48,160
[SPEAKER_06]: These open space requirements allow for development density that we believe is consistent with the affordable housing objectives of the City of Medford as provided in its 2023 comprehensive plan and its objection of that plan to create 600 housing units by fiscal year 2025.

457
00:51:49,181 --> 00:51:53,422
[SPEAKER_06]: If the proposed redevelopment of the Walkling Court were approved by special permit,

458
00:51:54,602 --> 00:52:04,726
[SPEAKER_06]: under the proposed PDD amendment, the open space that will be created will actually be more usable and accessible than the existing open space.

459
00:52:06,326 --> 00:52:11,648
[SPEAKER_06]: The setbacks that are proposed under this PDD amendment will be the same as on the site today.

460
00:52:11,668 --> 00:52:18,171
[SPEAKER_06]: 15-foot front yard, a 10-foot side yard, and a 15-foot rear yard.

461
00:52:18,971 --> 00:52:21,172
[SPEAKER_06]: There is, in the PDD amendment,

462
00:52:22,332 --> 00:52:36,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, a provision that provides that given the topography of the site along North street, that no setback for parking space spaces and areas located in the front yard of any lot are required.

463
00:52:37,551 --> 00:52:39,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Maximum lot coverage would be 35%.

464
00:52:41,335 --> 00:52:56,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Maximum height and stories in the PDD-3 would depend on use with 75 feet and six stories for multiple dwellings and 35 feet and three stories for attached single-family dwellings.

465
00:52:57,609 --> 00:53:05,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and lastly, parking the proposed parking requirements that are in the amendment would be 1 space for every 2 units.

466
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:11,633
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the same parking ratio under the underlying zoning for affordable housing.

467
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:24,680
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last element to call to your attention is the provision in the proposed PDD amendment concerning the screening of mechanical equipment.

468
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:42,245
[SPEAKER_06]: We've added that provision to be in place to minimize the visibility of such equipment from the street or from neighboring properties, subject to ensuring that the equipment will function and operate effectively

469
00:53:42,905 --> 00:53:43,886
[SPEAKER_06]: with such screening.

470
00:53:45,367 --> 00:53:52,190
[SPEAKER_06]: That, Madam Chair, is the summary of the proposed amendment to the PDD that we have in front of you.

471
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:54,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I welcome any questions at this time.

472
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:03,897
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you so much, Attorney Kilson, for your detailed coverage of the amendment.

473
00:54:04,057 --> 00:54:05,317
[SPEAKER_30]: And thank you, Ms.

474
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,438
[SPEAKER_30]: Jansen, for your

475
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,087
[SPEAKER_30]: presentation.

476
00:54:09,047 --> 00:54:21,771
[SPEAKER_30]: My, the one question I have before I open it up to the board is I do have the final amendment myself, but I'm not sure if it was, I'm not sure how, what the actual differences was.

477
00:54:21,851 --> 00:54:35,655
[SPEAKER_30]: And I guess this is my question to attorney Silverstein, that everything that was addressed within the questions that you originally had in previous drafts, if they were rectified and made whole.

478
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:38,915
[SPEAKER_30]: for us in the final part.

479
00:54:41,275 --> 00:54:45,136
[SPEAKER_34]: Good evening, I'm Jonathan Silverstein, counsel for the board on this matter.

480
00:54:45,256 --> 00:54:48,937
[SPEAKER_34]: So yes, it's been a very cooperative process.

481
00:54:50,057 --> 00:54:55,239
[SPEAKER_34]: My comments were fairly minimal and they have been addressed to my satisfaction.

482
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:57,779
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm happy to walk you through them if you like.

483
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:07,182
[SPEAKER_34]: And also just wanna, I know this is the third go round for PDDs, so the board's probably getting used to the process, but just a reminder that this is,

484
00:55:08,022 --> 00:55:25,305
[SPEAKER_34]: That first public hearing that's required really as an introductory public hearing, the final version of the ordinance will come back to you after it's referred by the council for a public hearing, the statutorily required public hearing.

485
00:55:25,385 --> 00:55:33,047
[SPEAKER_34]: So the board will certainly have an opportunity to review and make recommendations on the final version.

486
00:55:35,068 --> 00:55:43,155
[SPEAKER_34]: But if you like, I can summarize just a couple of changes that were made from the original draft.

487
00:55:45,977 --> 00:55:50,381
[SPEAKER_34]: And obviously, each time this with each new PDD, there's.

488
00:55:51,986 --> 00:55:59,469
[SPEAKER_34]: there's more for the applicant to look to in terms of prior examples.

489
00:55:59,509 --> 00:56:04,872
[SPEAKER_34]: This was really, as I said, it came to me and pretty much from my standpoint finished condition.

490
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:15,957
[SPEAKER_34]: One thing we added was a provision just allowing the council to permit changes from the original

491
00:56:17,112 --> 00:56:32,316
[SPEAKER_34]: Preliminary plan if it deems that it's in the public interest just to have that flexibility in case there's some site condition or something that requires a change that would be deemed substantial and to not have to start this process all over again and have a new zoning amendment.

492
00:56:34,217 --> 00:56:35,597
[SPEAKER_34]: The provision that

493
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:42,825
[SPEAKER_34]: was just mentioned with respect to screening of mechanicals.

494
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:50,434
[SPEAKER_34]: I suggested adding screening them from neighboring properties as well as public ways and that was readily accepted.

495
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:59,611
[SPEAKER_34]: Suggested some format changes which were non-substantive that were agreed to.

496
00:56:59,631 --> 00:57:17,026
[SPEAKER_34]: And then I suggested a provision that would allow the council as a special permit granting authority to impose conditions regarding the affordability and just the administrative process of getting the units on the SHI.

497
00:57:17,807 --> 00:57:19,448
[SPEAKER_34]: And that was pretty much it.

498
00:57:21,615 --> 00:57:25,323
[SPEAKER_34]: in terms of any meaningful changes that I had suggested.

499
00:57:25,423 --> 00:57:32,017
[SPEAKER_34]: So as I said, I really, I saw it in a pretty finished condition already.

500
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:35,010
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Attorney Silverstein.

501
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:36,111
[SPEAKER_30]: I appreciate it.

502
00:57:36,251 --> 00:57:50,577
[SPEAKER_30]: I want to remind the board and the public before we move forward, again, that as Attorney Silverstein has already noticed, we were given a high-level conceptual presentation by Meffitt Housing Authority and their team.

503
00:57:52,145 --> 00:58:05,149
[SPEAKER_30]: Although we're focusing only on zoning, like the uses and the dimensions for this first meeting, although the vision informs the zoning, we're going to save all the rest for the site plan review at a later date.

504
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:19,134
[SPEAKER_30]: And because it's dimensional and zoning and all bound in law, for my purposes, I do not have any more questions that attorney Silverstein has not already answered.

505
00:58:19,608 --> 00:58:25,790
[SPEAKER_30]: So at this time, I'm going to open it up to the board for any questions.

506
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:42,995
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, and I think this is something Attorney Silverstein already said, but I just want to confirm, because it was my understanding from our previous couple PDDs, that this is, I think this is good, both a rehash for the board and for the public, that this is a,

507
00:58:44,128 --> 00:58:49,451
[SPEAKER_27]: that the purpose of this hearing is to deal with the zoning of the site, not the specifics of the project.

508
00:58:50,752 --> 00:58:51,532
[SPEAKER_30]: Exactly.

509
00:58:51,953 --> 00:58:55,635
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, we are not discussing the project itself tonight.

510
00:58:55,655 --> 00:59:01,718
[SPEAKER_27]: We're considering the zoning characteristics and the zoning regulations of the piece of land that it sits on.

511
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:05,680
[SPEAKER_27]: Just an important distinction, I think, to make.

512
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:08,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Peter.

513
00:59:10,283 --> 00:59:10,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair?

514
00:59:11,444 --> 00:59:11,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

515
00:59:12,676 --> 00:59:16,019
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to check with Member Calvez.

516
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:19,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you going to recuse yourself from this item?

517
00:59:21,803 --> 00:59:34,893
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I think I have to recuse myself from voting for this item as I work for Niche Engineering, who did the traffic study for this project, and it is their preference that we recuse ourselves from projects they work with in Fort Worth.

518
00:59:37,455 --> 00:59:37,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Peter.

519
00:59:38,135 --> 00:59:38,936
[SPEAKER_30]: Sorry to interrupt.

520
00:59:39,937 --> 00:59:40,177
[SPEAKER_31]: No problem.

521
00:59:41,124 --> 00:59:42,685
[SPEAKER_30]: No, that was definitely important.

522
00:59:42,725 --> 00:59:43,626
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Amanda.

523
00:59:45,927 --> 00:59:49,870
[SPEAKER_30]: Are there any further comments from the board or questions?

524
00:59:57,295 --> 00:59:59,777
[SPEAKER_30]: Are there any questions or comments from the city staff?

525
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:18,671
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, I'm going to open it up for hearing none from the board or from the city staff.

526
01:00:18,731 --> 01:00:20,312
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm going to open it up for public comment.

527
01:00:21,072 --> 01:00:24,673
[SPEAKER_30]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message.

528
01:00:26,994 --> 01:00:29,635
[SPEAKER_30]: Roberta is- I think Roberta and Dennis.

529
01:00:31,816 --> 01:00:36,538
[SPEAKER_30]: They're part of the public in this regard.

530
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:45,581
[SPEAKER_30]: To start again, those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Amanda in the comments.

531
01:00:45,601 --> 01:00:49,844
[SPEAKER_30]: You can also send an email to ocd at medford-ma.gov.

532
01:00:50,584 --> 01:00:54,066
[SPEAKER_30]: Individuals may have up to three minutes to provide comments.

533
01:00:54,546 --> 01:00:57,808
[SPEAKER_30]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

534
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:02,651
[SPEAKER_30]: Please do not use the chat feature to provide comments as it is not a part of the public record.

535
01:01:03,271 --> 01:01:08,074
[SPEAKER_30]: Amanda, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

536
01:01:10,123 --> 01:01:10,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

537
01:01:10,904 --> 01:01:13,585
[SPEAKER_03]: So, sorry, I'm just collecting names here.

538
01:01:13,665 --> 01:01:15,526
[SPEAKER_03]: I see several raised hands.

539
01:01:16,647 --> 01:01:20,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe the first hand that I saw was Roberta Cameron.

540
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:24,032
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could just state your name and address for the record.

541
01:01:24,052 --> 01:01:25,753
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ask to unmute.

542
01:01:29,955 --> 01:01:31,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for giving me the opportunity.

543
01:01:34,117 --> 01:01:45,981
[SPEAKER_02]: As a member of the Community Preservation Committee, I have been aware of this project as we've been asked to provide funding of the city's Community Preservation Act funds for this project.

544
01:01:46,161 --> 01:01:57,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And we strongly support this project and think it's incredibly important for upgrading the quality of the housing that's provided.

545
01:01:57,665 --> 01:02:13,297
[SPEAKER_02]: to the seniors and disabled residents of Walkland Court and the Medford Housing Authority in general, and really excited about the addition of family housing, and in particular, family housing for people with disabilities.

546
01:02:13,857 --> 01:02:17,960
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a much, much unmet need for the city.

547
01:02:18,628 --> 01:02:25,230
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a neighbor, I live on, I forget if I stated my address for the record, 12 North Street.

548
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:43,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been following this process very closely all along and have attended several of the community meetings with others of my neighbors and have been really impressed with the opportunities for gathering input from

549
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:53,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Public housing residents and from neighbors to design a very sensitive development that really fits the space sensitively and.

550
01:02:57,045 --> 01:03:16,330
[SPEAKER_02]: provides acoustical screening to mitigate the impact that residents currently have from being located near the train tracks, employing better technology and better quality building materials than were originally built for this site.

551
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:29,253
[SPEAKER_02]: So I also, as a member of Housing Medford, have talked with a lot of people who see, who very urgently need the kind of housing that is being provided here.

552
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:43,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I hope that the housing authority is able to stick with their schedule and to get this development, the zoning passed and the development to be under construction.

553
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:49,735
[SPEAKER_02]: as soon as possible to meet the needs of the community.

554
01:03:50,115 --> 01:03:50,896
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

555
01:03:52,677 --> 01:03:53,177
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Ms.

556
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:53,578
[SPEAKER_30]: Campbell.

557
01:03:55,419 --> 01:03:56,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

558
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:56,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

559
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,042
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have next in the queue, Dennis.

560
01:03:59,122 --> 01:04:05,386
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to ask you to unmute, and if you have three minutes to provide comment, and if you could just state your name and address for the record.

561
01:04:08,729 --> 01:04:11,390
[SPEAKER_25]: Hi, my name is Dennis Setlin-Kaltofer.

562
01:04:11,751 --> 01:04:13,412
[SPEAKER_25]: I live at 120 North Street.

563
01:04:14,346 --> 01:04:30,697
[SPEAKER_25]: And although I'm not a resident of Wapling Court, I'm speaking in support of one of the residents who's talked with me directly, and perhaps some who have not come forward publicly, but have expressed concerns privately.

564
01:04:31,717 --> 01:04:43,905
[SPEAKER_25]: I think part of, from what I understand, part of the rezoning has to do with putting in a six floor building, which would be right next to the commuter rail,

565
01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:47,974
[SPEAKER_25]: And that would be for seniors and disabled.

566
01:04:49,294 --> 01:04:57,639
[SPEAKER_25]: And I know that diesel fumes, noise and vibrations are an issue for a lot of people.

567
01:04:59,019 --> 01:05:09,285
[SPEAKER_25]: I know someone not in that development who lives close to that commuter rail and has to close his windows every time a train comes by.

568
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:23,870
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, there's a plan to put a new road through the complex, which the disabled and elderly would have to cross to get from one building to another.

569
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:32,716
[SPEAKER_25]: Also, that the redevelopment would require the cutting down of some rare trees, as I understand.

570
01:05:34,117 --> 01:05:39,180
[SPEAKER_25]: And I can personally think of some alternatives, which I'd like to just throw out.

571
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:54,683
[SPEAKER_25]: One would be, excuse me, to place people into vacant apartments, which I think there are probably lots of luxury apartments available that are not being occupied.

572
01:05:55,103 --> 01:05:56,824
[SPEAKER_25]: I know there are some in Cambridge.

573
01:05:58,645 --> 01:06:09,648
[SPEAKER_25]: And also, since a lot of the residents will need to be relocated to temporary facilities during the construction, are those facilities

574
01:06:10,346 --> 01:06:12,347
[SPEAKER_25]: available on a permanent basis?

575
01:06:13,247 --> 01:06:17,630
[SPEAKER_25]: And could they be used to house new residents instead?

576
01:06:20,331 --> 01:06:29,615
[SPEAKER_25]: And also, the third question I have is, isn't there a way to put elevators, to add elevators to the existing structures?

577
01:06:30,656 --> 01:06:30,976
[SPEAKER_25]: That's it.

578
01:06:38,650 --> 01:06:39,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dennis.

579
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:50,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Chair, do we want to go through all of the public comment first, or should we have the applicant address the questions that were raised by the resident?

580
01:06:52,176 --> 01:07:01,620
[SPEAKER_30]: I think the most efficient way is in case an actual member of the public has to jump the meeting before we get to the end, maybe we can address individually.

581
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:06,582
[SPEAKER_30]: And especially in case the same question comes up again, we have it.

582
01:07:09,973 --> 01:07:10,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

583
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:12,855
[SPEAKER_03]: So to clarify, we're going to go through all the comment first.

584
01:07:13,536 --> 01:07:14,096
[SPEAKER_30]: I believe so.

585
01:07:14,396 --> 01:07:25,084
[SPEAKER_30]: No, I think you should probably I think we should probably address them individually in case the person that the member of the public that asked the question has to jump before the end of the meeting.

586
01:07:25,945 --> 01:07:26,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Understood.

587
01:07:27,446 --> 01:07:31,609
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'll invite the applicant to respond to those questions.

588
01:07:34,621 --> 01:07:35,081
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

589
01:07:35,822 --> 01:07:37,083
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'll take a first step.

590
01:07:38,224 --> 01:07:49,153
[SPEAKER_18]: So going backwards, so if it's possible to add elevators to the existing structures, that would likely be very difficult and cost prohibitive.

591
01:07:49,213 --> 01:07:52,496
[SPEAKER_18]: There are nine different buildings that are two stories each.

592
01:07:53,396 --> 01:07:59,141
[SPEAKER_18]: So that would require adding nine separate elevator buildings or elevator cores.

593
01:08:00,382 --> 01:08:03,805
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's also not the properties in pretty poor condition.

594
01:08:05,316 --> 01:08:20,587
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think that would be very challenging in terms of relocating households to other temporary housing and making that permanent housing that's available.

595
01:08:20,727 --> 01:08:26,571
[SPEAKER_18]: So part of the Medford Housing Authority's plan as it relates to relocation is to provide

596
01:08:28,048 --> 01:08:32,090
[SPEAKER_18]: comparable units and other MHA properties to do this.

597
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:38,992
[SPEAKER_18]: These are vacant units that they will then be using to temporarily house Waukland Court residents.

598
01:08:39,993 --> 01:08:46,575
[SPEAKER_18]: So that would essentially not be, that would essentially be reducing the amount of affordable housing that

599
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,001
[SPEAKER_18]: that MHA will be offering.

600
01:08:50,502 --> 01:09:01,664
[SPEAKER_18]: The real goal right now is to provide better replacement housing for the 144 units that are currently on site.

601
01:09:03,084 --> 01:09:12,086
[SPEAKER_18]: And then just the comment related to the location of the six-story mid-rise by the MBT commuter rail.

602
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,667
[SPEAKER_18]: So currently the site was built in 1960.

603
01:09:15,637 --> 01:09:22,559
[SPEAKER_18]: at a time when building construction and building materials, as well as standards were much lower than they are today.

604
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,880
[SPEAKER_18]: And so noise is an issue at the property.

605
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,061
[SPEAKER_18]: The goal is by building a new mid rise.

606
01:09:31,361 --> 01:09:42,484
[SPEAKER_18]: There is an acoustical engineer who's part of the design team who has provided suggestions both in terms of the now we're getting into some design questions.

607
01:09:42,564 --> 01:09:42,724
[SPEAKER_18]: So

608
01:09:44,487 --> 01:09:48,570
[SPEAKER_18]: If the board feels like this is too much of a site plan review issue, let me know.

609
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:59,297
[SPEAKER_18]: But essentially, the building has been designed in such a way that it limits the amount of units that are directly parallel to the MBTA commuter rail.

610
01:09:59,758 --> 01:10:13,107
[SPEAKER_18]: And also, the facade construction includes various items such as the use of triple pane windows, as well as additional insulation in order to do noise mitigation.

611
01:10:14,055 --> 01:10:20,877
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the key deficiencies at Waukland Court today is that there's not adequate ventilation in the units.

612
01:10:21,897 --> 01:10:29,879
[SPEAKER_18]: That is something that the redevelopment of the property and the construction of these mid-rise buildings will provide.

613
01:10:30,539 --> 01:10:40,801
[SPEAKER_18]: So that should help with making sure that households have access to clean air in their unit.

614
01:10:43,759 --> 01:10:44,600
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Ms.

615
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:45,100
[SPEAKER_30]: Jensen.

616
01:10:45,440 --> 01:11:01,953
[SPEAKER_30]: Actually, I'm going to come back to this and I just realized to make sure that we are staying on task and we're answering and that the proponent feels comfortable answering the questions that's related to zoning and the questions that you actually feel are relevant to the case, not that all of the public comments are not relevant.

617
01:11:02,093 --> 01:11:12,961
[SPEAKER_30]: Amanda, how about we do take a tally of the questions as we go through and then decide which ones are relevant to tonight's public hearing and have the proponent answer the ones that they're able to at the end.

618
01:11:15,403 --> 01:11:16,504
[SPEAKER_30]: to keep it more efficient.

619
01:11:17,325 --> 01:11:20,989
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, yep, I can and I can keep track of what we're hearing.

620
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:22,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

621
01:11:24,373 --> 01:11:24,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

622
01:11:24,713 --> 01:11:27,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, next in the queue, I have Diane McKinney.

623
01:11:28,577 --> 01:11:33,643
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could, you have three minutes to provide comment if you could state your name and address for the record.

624
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:40,991
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, can you hear me?

625
01:11:41,451 --> 01:11:41,771
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

626
01:11:42,512 --> 01:11:42,972
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi.

627
01:11:43,093 --> 01:11:44,314
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Diane McKinney.

628
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:53,862
[SPEAKER_22]: I live at 10 Carlton Road in Tewksbury, but I have a direct abutment to the actual site.

629
01:11:54,163 --> 01:11:57,306
[SPEAKER_22]: It's 29 North Street.

630
01:11:57,366 --> 01:11:59,267
[SPEAKER_22]: This is my first meeting, so forgive me.

631
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:04,672
[SPEAKER_22]: But from all the plans that I had looked at,

632
01:12:05,868 --> 01:12:13,353
[SPEAKER_22]: I have not seen anything regarding any environmental assessments or impact studies that are going to happen with this site.

633
01:12:14,273 --> 01:12:17,755
[SPEAKER_22]: I do know the history back in the 1960s.

634
01:12:19,036 --> 01:12:20,477
[SPEAKER_22]: It was a coal and oil.

635
01:12:21,297 --> 01:12:26,961
[SPEAKER_22]: There was a dump directly adjacent to the 29 North Street.

636
01:12:28,161 --> 01:12:33,865
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just wanted to find out what is going on in that respect before any of these

637
01:12:35,773 --> 01:12:58,199
[SPEAKER_22]: um, you know, rezoning initiatives are actually approved, that if anybody has looked at the environmental impacts of what is going to happen with doing a six-story, you know, two six-story buildings and all of the rest, and also, there, I was wondering if an impact assessment has been done for environmental justice purposes.

638
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:03,921
[SPEAKER_22]: This is going to directly impact the neighborhood, and please, you know, I,

639
01:13:05,427 --> 01:13:15,957
[SPEAKER_22]: I am totally for having affordable housing, especially for the elderly and disabled.

640
01:13:16,577 --> 01:13:21,182
[SPEAKER_22]: I am not in any way, shape, or form trying to downplay any of that.

641
01:13:21,402 --> 01:13:25,005
[SPEAKER_22]: But this is a very big impact on the neighborhood itself.

642
01:13:25,926 --> 01:13:28,168
[SPEAKER_22]: And just wanted to know if that's been addressed.

643
01:13:28,629 --> 01:13:31,131
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't seen anything on any of the plans.

644
01:13:33,970 --> 01:13:41,912
[SPEAKER_30]: And for clarification, not that we're answering this question now, I just want the city to take note in response to environmental metric.

645
01:13:42,093 --> 01:13:44,693
[SPEAKER_30]: This site is not an environmental justice site.

646
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:46,434
[SPEAKER_30]: I just wanted to make that clear.

647
01:13:46,454 --> 01:13:49,255
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I looked at the map.

648
01:13:50,175 --> 01:14:01,645
[SPEAKER_22]: And it looked like Watling Court and certain sections of North Street going from Marshall to Route 16 are included in Block Group 1, Tract 3394.

649
01:14:02,946 --> 01:14:04,507
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what the map looked like.

650
01:14:04,928 --> 01:14:05,248
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

651
01:14:05,828 --> 01:14:15,977
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so if I'm mistaken, but I looked at the map and it was considered an environmental justice impact population.

652
01:14:15,997 --> 01:14:16,357
[SPEAKER_30]: Mm-hmm.

653
01:14:23,234 --> 01:14:28,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and just a reminder, I'm taking notes, so don't feel like your comments aren't being heard.

654
01:14:28,696 --> 01:14:29,697
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll address them at the end.

655
01:14:31,077 --> 01:14:33,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Next in the queue is Diane Sullivan.

656
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:38,921
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could state your name and address for the record, and you have three minutes to provide comment.

657
01:14:42,098 --> 01:14:54,007
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Diane Sullivan Jerome street West Bedford just outside of that quarter of a mile radius from walk on court I want to first thank you Madam Chair and the board.

658
01:14:54,948 --> 01:14:59,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the presentation I, while I live in the neighborhood I haven't been.

659
01:15:00,352 --> 01:15:06,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, as involved and updated, I am thrilled that we are here tonight and.

660
01:15:07,156 --> 01:15:10,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Support wholeheartedly the Medford housing authority.

661
01:15:10,057 --> 01:15:14,380
[SPEAKER_05]: And taking this step that we all know is long overdue.

662
01:15:17,181 --> 01:15:32,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Through you, Madam Chair, to the prior Diane's comments, one thing we do know the impact of for certain is the lack of affordable housing, particularly in this neighborhood.

663
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:42,737
[SPEAKER_05]: As a resident here, I can speak personally to the impact of gentrification in our neighborhood.

664
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:51,684
[SPEAKER_05]: To the impact of the lack of housing at Tufts University and how that impacts this historic neighborhood.

665
01:15:52,885 --> 01:15:56,768
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I'm excited to see what will come of this.

666
01:15:58,449 --> 01:16:07,194
[SPEAKER_05]: and Roberta, again, was thrilled to hear that the city is poised to invest its CPA funds in this.

667
01:16:08,315 --> 01:16:15,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Also appreciate all those Cambridge Housing for stepping in and providing consulting for the legal support that this requires.

668
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:18,341
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a Herculean effort to build housing.

669
01:16:19,301 --> 01:16:28,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, to to add 94 units to a city that desperately needs it and, you know, it is to 1 of the prior speakers.

670
01:16:28,454 --> 01:16:34,542
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we heard a little bit about, you know, what what are some of the concerns the existing concerns of presidents and going forward.

671
01:16:35,623 --> 01:16:37,885
[SPEAKER_05]: But we haven't yet heard from a resident.

672
01:16:39,226 --> 01:16:40,887
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to make that point.

673
01:16:41,187 --> 01:16:42,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Proxy voices are important.

674
01:16:43,709 --> 01:16:49,073
[SPEAKER_05]: It is critically important to provide space where people feel safe to express those concerns.

675
01:16:50,474 --> 01:16:57,379
[SPEAKER_05]: Look back at some of the presentation materials in preparation for this meeting.

676
01:16:58,379 --> 01:17:03,223
[SPEAKER_05]: From what I've heard even this evening, some of the concerns that were expressed are being addressed.

677
01:17:04,463 --> 01:17:07,345
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here to just say that I am 10 toes down.

678
01:17:07,365 --> 01:17:13,547
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thrilled to, again, hear from some of the abutting neighbors.

679
01:17:13,727 --> 01:17:18,890
[SPEAKER_05]: My daughter happens to live on North Street, who are in full support of this.

680
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:26,173
[SPEAKER_05]: NIMBYism has no place particularly in West Medford.

681
01:17:26,753 --> 01:17:31,555
[SPEAKER_05]: To see the addition of family units, and thank you, Roberta, also for that clarification on

682
01:17:32,696 --> 01:17:33,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Units that are accessible.

683
01:17:34,977 --> 01:17:41,121
[SPEAKER_05]: It is disruptive to families up to to individuals who will be, you know.

684
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:44,911
[SPEAKER_05]: located somewhere else, right, while this happens.

685
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:58,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I believe that, you know, everyone involved is working in good faith to make sure that we can lessen any disruption so that ultimately people return to an even better quality of life.

686
01:17:58,954 --> 01:18:05,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my question to the folks who are doing the planning is, you know, what are you hearing from folks?

687
01:18:05,335 --> 01:18:08,456
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe there are some concerns that, you know, you can't address.

688
01:18:09,216 --> 01:18:14,700
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I have faith that everybody's operating in good faith.

689
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:23,767
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just acknowledging this is outside of the zoning discussion, but I think it would be good to hear what has been coming from those conversations.

690
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:37,057
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great to hear that folks are eager, but we also live in a world and individuals exist in spaces where a disruption like this can impact their quality of life.

691
01:18:37,998 --> 01:18:41,040
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, I would welcome the opportunity.

692
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:41,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

693
01:18:41,861 --> 01:18:43,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry to interrupt.

694
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:45,404
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a bit over three minutes.

695
01:18:45,424 --> 01:18:50,669
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to make sure you had your questions poised in there.

696
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:52,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have.

697
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Amanda, for for reining me in.

698
01:18:54,172 --> 01:18:55,333
[SPEAKER_05]: These are important issues.

699
01:18:55,453 --> 01:18:56,654
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we could talk all night.

700
01:18:57,455 --> 01:18:58,055
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

701
01:18:58,476 --> 01:18:59,617
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate everyone's time.

702
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:05,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, next in our queue is William Navar.

703
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:10,818
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have three minutes to provide comment and if you could state your name and address for the record.

704
01:19:15,622 --> 01:19:19,484
[SPEAKER_23]: Hello, William Navar, 108 Medford Street.

705
01:19:19,925 --> 01:19:22,967
[SPEAKER_23]: Basically, I support the zoning because I support the project.

706
01:19:24,122 --> 01:19:29,885
[SPEAKER_23]: We obviously got a housing crisis, especially a shortage of deeply affordable housing, which is what's proposed.

707
01:19:31,025 --> 01:19:34,347
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's what's going to happen if this zoning gets passed.

708
01:19:34,927 --> 01:19:46,872
[SPEAKER_23]: When it comes to concerns that the project is too big or crams too much housing onto the lot, it's important to remember that addressing that by making it smaller, it's going to mean

709
01:19:47,977 --> 01:19:51,759
[SPEAKER_23]: a smaller project, just smaller housing or less housing.

710
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:56,182
[SPEAKER_23]: It means doing less to address the housing shortage than what's proposed.

711
01:19:56,522 --> 01:19:59,824
[SPEAKER_23]: And it'd be turning away more people who need a place to live.

712
01:20:01,345 --> 01:20:01,725
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

713
01:20:01,805 --> 01:20:03,266
[SPEAKER_23]: That's my public comment.

714
01:20:07,689 --> 01:20:08,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

715
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:11,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Next in our queue is Susan

716
01:20:19,057 --> 01:20:20,917
[SPEAKER_31]: Oh, Danielle cut out, Susan Gerard.

717
01:20:20,937 --> 01:20:22,838
[SPEAKER_21]: Let me unmute you.

718
01:20:24,538 --> 01:20:25,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Oops, sorry.

719
01:20:25,998 --> 01:20:26,538
[SPEAKER_03]: I was muted.

720
01:20:27,139 --> 01:20:28,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Susan, I see you there.

721
01:20:28,659 --> 01:20:34,780
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could state your name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes to provide comment.

722
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:36,760
[SPEAKER_15]: I really don't need to.

723
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:38,981
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a member of Housing Medford.

724
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,721
[SPEAKER_15]: I live on 26 Farragut Avenue, East Medford.

725
01:20:41,801 --> 01:20:45,302
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't live in the area, so I could say my

726
01:20:45,982 --> 01:20:53,806
[SPEAKER_15]: concerns are different, but I did tutor a woman who had cancer in that housing project many years ago.

727
01:20:53,886 --> 01:20:58,048
[SPEAKER_15]: She was an immigrant and the stairs were difficult for her, I will say that.

728
01:20:58,768 --> 01:21:07,513
[SPEAKER_15]: But more important, I've had a number of friends who really needed low-income senior housing

729
01:21:08,794 --> 01:21:24,572
[SPEAKER_15]: in Medford and were told that there was, I don't remember how many years, two, three, four years waiting lists for people desperate for this housing and they eventually moved out of Medford because they could not survive here.

730
01:21:25,233 --> 01:21:28,334
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm just speaking in strong favor of the project.

731
01:21:28,414 --> 01:21:30,695
[SPEAKER_15]: I realize there's some concerns.

732
01:21:31,235 --> 01:21:33,376
[SPEAKER_15]: I have heard about the trees.

733
01:21:33,896 --> 01:21:39,738
[SPEAKER_15]: I know someone talked about the historic trees or something that the trees were not that historic.

734
01:21:39,818 --> 01:21:42,219
[SPEAKER_15]: They were just trees, but they are rebuilding.

735
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:46,680
[SPEAKER_15]: As I understand it, they are planting trees to replace some of those, at least.

736
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,321
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're all concerned about the environment.

737
01:21:49,341 --> 01:21:51,582
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not a particularly

738
01:21:53,022 --> 01:22:01,911
[SPEAKER_15]: Green area, I think there's green spaces that are going to be provided, but I think most important is what people have said that we desperately need affordable housing in Medford.

739
01:22:02,152 --> 01:22:06,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody who isn't wealthy at this point can afford to move here.

740
01:22:06,616 --> 01:22:09,759
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's my comment and I support the project.

741
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:10,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

742
01:22:13,882 --> 01:22:14,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Susan.

743
01:22:16,004 --> 01:22:18,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Next in our queue is Kate.

744
01:22:19,007 --> 01:22:24,332
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could provide your full name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes to provide comment.

745
01:22:26,814 --> 01:22:30,358
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, my name is Kate Ryan, and I currently live at 15.

746
01:22:36,043 --> 01:22:36,744
[SPEAKER_11]: Should I start again?

747
01:22:37,365 --> 01:22:37,585
[SPEAKER_35]: Yeah.

748
01:22:38,678 --> 01:22:47,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, my name is Kate Ryan, and I currently live at 15 Canal Street in West Medford, which is a Medford public housing building.

749
01:22:48,545 --> 01:22:52,088
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am disabled with a disability that is progressing.

750
01:22:52,608 --> 01:22:57,712
[SPEAKER_11]: And if I am lucky, I still have a couple more years where I am not in a wheelchair full-time.

751
01:22:58,112 --> 01:22:59,574
[SPEAKER_11]: I currently use one part-time.

752
01:23:00,094 --> 01:23:03,557
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will tell you that this housing is desperately needed.

753
01:23:04,357 --> 01:23:06,819
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you, you probably do know people with COVID.

754
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,341
[SPEAKER_11]: 10% of people are going to get long COVID.

755
01:23:10,682 --> 01:23:12,364
[SPEAKER_11]: And we aren't accommodating that.

756
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:18,889
[SPEAKER_11]: We aren't thinking ahead of the fact that a large, large number of people are going to need more accessible housing.

757
01:23:19,389 --> 01:23:26,035
[SPEAKER_11]: A large number of people are going to be unable to work and may end up in this type of housing.

758
01:23:27,236 --> 01:23:29,738
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe that my disability is a bad thing.

759
01:23:29,898 --> 01:23:30,679
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't believe

760
01:23:32,303 --> 01:23:44,586
[SPEAKER_11]: that just because I have multiple disabilities means that I don't have the right, the same as everyone has the right, to good, clean places to live which I can access.

761
01:23:45,126 --> 01:23:53,208
[SPEAKER_11]: Currently, I have to go up half a flight of stairs to get to my apartment, which is very lovely, but it's very difficult.

762
01:23:54,250 --> 01:23:55,894
[SPEAKER_11]: I really want to stay in Medford.

763
01:23:56,195 --> 01:24:03,271
[SPEAKER_11]: My friends are here, my community is here, and I work hard to be a part of this community and to give back in what ways that I can.

764
01:24:04,461 --> 01:24:06,503
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know what's going to happen in the future.

765
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:09,925
[SPEAKER_11]: And walking court, for me, is a bit of light in the future.

766
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:11,246
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a bit of hope.

767
01:24:11,306 --> 01:24:14,329
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a bit of something that people really need.

768
01:24:15,209 --> 01:24:26,198
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you think that it's not that big of a deal for people to live in inaccessible buildings, I would really, really like to give you just five or 10 minutes of the pain that I live with every day.

769
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,081
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is all.

770
01:24:33,489 --> 01:24:34,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Kate.

771
01:24:37,112 --> 01:24:39,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Next in our queue is Dave Peters.

772
01:24:40,114 --> 01:24:46,259
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you could state your full name for the record, as well as your address, and you'll have three minutes to provide a comment.

773
01:24:51,563 --> 01:24:52,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you hear me?

774
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:53,905
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

775
01:24:55,646 --> 01:24:57,728
[SPEAKER_07]: David Peters, 17 North Street.

776
01:24:59,129 --> 01:25:00,650
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the owner of this property.

777
01:25:02,203 --> 01:25:11,090
[SPEAKER_07]: I have several comments, but I understand that from this purpose of this meeting is just particularly for zoning.

778
01:25:13,712 --> 01:25:25,701
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to just go through back in the 1960s when this plan was taken over by the states for the purpose of elderly housing.

779
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:49,745
[SPEAKER_07]: they went through with all the residents and came up with an agreement so it wouldn't disturb and impact the residents that they would keep these buildings at two stories and keep that, you know, in coercion with the surrounding neighborhood.

780
01:25:51,286 --> 01:25:58,049
[SPEAKER_07]: To go from two-story buildings to six-story buildings is way out of character for this neighborhood.

781
01:25:58,754 --> 01:26:15,289
[SPEAKER_07]: It puts several impacts on residents, sunlight, I mean, everything I can go into detail, but we all know that going from two stories to six stories is a huge, huge difference.

782
01:26:17,571 --> 01:26:25,458
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanna make sure that this board received the petition

783
01:26:26,544 --> 01:26:35,270
[SPEAKER_07]: that we've had over 1,100 people sign in opposition to this proposed project.

784
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:40,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I go any further, I want to say I know there's a need for low-income housing.

785
01:26:41,195 --> 01:26:41,755
[SPEAKER_07]: I get that.

786
01:26:42,275 --> 01:26:52,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not opposed to the redevelopment in back, but to put six-story and four-story buildings there is out of character.

787
01:26:53,915 --> 01:26:55,236
[SPEAKER_07]: of this residential neighborhood.

788
01:26:56,177 --> 01:27:07,485
[SPEAKER_07]: And 95% at least of this whole community going outwards, this whole neighborhood has felt that same way.

789
01:27:11,969 --> 01:27:13,250
[SPEAKER_07]: They could do several things.

790
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:19,374
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gone to several meetings and everything that we suggested went out the window.

791
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:22,617
[SPEAKER_07]: So they can say that they've had seven,

792
01:27:23,511 --> 01:27:26,654
[SPEAKER_07]: residential meetings and it was productive.

793
01:27:27,114 --> 01:27:31,118
[SPEAKER_07]: It was not productive because everything we brought up was dismissed.

794
01:27:35,001 --> 01:27:44,269
[SPEAKER_07]: So I urge this board to reject this rezoning of this proposed project the way it is now.

795
01:27:45,210 --> 01:27:47,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, I know there's a need and

796
01:27:48,797 --> 01:28:00,299
[SPEAKER_07]: those buildings are somewhat old and deteriorating and the need for elevators or handicapped accessible, but there's other ways to going about this.

797
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will leave it there.

798
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:03,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

799
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:07,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dave.

800
01:28:08,761 --> 01:28:11,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Next in our queue is Barry Ingber.

801
01:28:12,281 --> 01:28:16,222
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could provide your name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes to provide comment.

802
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:23,354
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street, and I want to thank you for this opportunity to speak.

803
01:28:24,294 --> 01:28:32,999
[SPEAKER_40]: I intended to speak in favor of the project as planned, but other people have said what I was going to say for the most part better than I could have.

804
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:46,948
[SPEAKER_40]: I just want to say that there's a kind of a whole new level of nimbyism happening when you can't put affordable housing in a public housing development.

805
01:28:48,258 --> 01:28:50,520
[SPEAKER_40]: It really kind of takes the cake.

806
01:28:52,382 --> 01:29:05,377
[SPEAKER_40]: But that said, I do have one comment, which is I hope that the redevelopment plan will include solar installations on the roof in compliance with Medford Solar Roof Ordinance that was passed in 2019.

807
01:29:07,358 --> 01:29:17,701
[SPEAKER_40]: This will reduce the carbon footprint of the housing, support the goal of energy resiliency, and potentially also provide an additional stream of funds for the MHA.

808
01:29:18,741 --> 01:29:19,181
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

809
01:29:22,882 --> 01:29:23,582
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Barry.

810
01:29:24,923 --> 01:29:26,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Next in our queue is Kyle.

811
01:29:27,964 --> 01:29:33,005
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could provide your full name and address for the record, you'll have three minutes to provide comments.

812
01:29:35,889 --> 01:29:38,011
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Kyle Joyce, 29 North Street.

813
01:29:38,771 --> 01:29:40,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for letting us speak tonight.

814
01:29:41,453 --> 01:29:44,516
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I just wanted to address the NIMBYism accusations.

815
01:29:45,116 --> 01:29:53,183
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that condescendingly calling someone a NIMBY or referring to legitimate concerns as NIMBYism is neither productive nor appropriate.

816
01:29:53,792 --> 01:29:57,156
[SPEAKER_00]: People live next to this complex and they have legitimate concerns.

817
01:29:57,797 --> 01:30:10,753
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that if you have such a problem with people having an issue with something that's going to directly impact where they live, then I suggest you take your proposal to the board and put public housing right next to your house.

818
01:30:11,594 --> 01:30:29,465
[SPEAKER_00]: Having said that, I do agree with the first Diane that spoke about an environmental impact survey, and just to be clear, I've spoken to many of the neighbours here, people who are abutters mainly, and this isn't about trees, at least for me, it's about kicking up oil,

819
01:30:30,219 --> 01:30:38,744
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially extremely hazardous materials such as lead or mercury that are in the lower layers of soil that could be there from up to 100 years ago.

820
01:30:39,185 --> 01:30:47,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people heated with oil back then and when that soot left people's chimneys, it settled into the soil and there was mercury as a byproduct.

821
01:30:47,690 --> 01:30:52,373
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you care about the environment, you should care about an environmental impact survey before any work is done.

822
01:30:53,257 --> 01:30:59,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm absolutely in favor of that, whether the final plan results in a 64 or 2 story complex or complexes.

823
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:08,002
[SPEAKER_00]: And in regards to the cost, I just was thinking when someone was speaking earlier, who was on the staff.

824
01:31:09,572 --> 01:31:23,645
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know the exact cost, but doing the math, it would seem like nine elevator units would cost much less than a $14 or $15 million budget being spent on a brand new 2023 housing project.

825
01:31:25,367 --> 01:31:30,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost every or every single house abutting Walkling Court was built over 100 years ago.

826
01:31:31,592 --> 01:31:32,533
[SPEAKER_00]: My house personally was 1910.

827
01:31:33,932 --> 01:31:47,642
[SPEAKER_00]: So a 1960-era brick housing complex I think is perfectly suited for anyone to live in, and I would favor renovations to be made as opposed to the potential air, sound, and physical impact that this proposal promotes.

828
01:31:47,682 --> 01:31:47,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

829
01:31:54,717 --> 01:31:55,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Kyle.

830
01:31:56,777 --> 01:31:59,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Next in our queue is A.N.

831
01:31:59,918 --> 01:32:04,439
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could provide your full name and address for the record, you'll have three minutes to provide a comment.

832
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,740
[SPEAKER_37]: My name is Anita Nagum.

833
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:14,901
[SPEAKER_37]: I live at 9 Norton Avenue.

834
01:32:15,461 --> 01:32:20,442
[SPEAKER_37]: It is definitely within the 400-foot radius of the border of Walkland Court.

835
01:32:21,832 --> 01:32:34,739
[SPEAKER_37]: First, I would like to state that I've spoken with dozens of people in this neighborhood, and there is no one who objects to this being renovated or rebuilt.

836
01:32:35,139 --> 01:32:40,762
[SPEAKER_37]: Many of us have friends who live there, and we know that the condition of this property definitely needs to be upgraded.

837
01:32:41,823 --> 01:32:50,028
[SPEAKER_37]: However, there is a general feeling that the Medford Housing Authority has not been responsive to the concerns of the neighborhood, as others have stated.

838
01:32:51,495 --> 01:32:53,477
[SPEAKER_37]: One example is the six-story building.

839
01:32:54,077 --> 01:32:57,499
[SPEAKER_37]: We were led to believe at the beginning that there would only be four-story buildings.

840
01:32:58,220 --> 01:33:00,821
[SPEAKER_37]: Then they came back and said, no, it's going to be six-story.

841
01:33:00,861 --> 01:33:08,026
[SPEAKER_37]: And when we raised concerns, they looked interested and came back at the next meeting and said, no, that's the only way we can do it.

842
01:33:09,927 --> 01:33:16,932
[SPEAKER_37]: There are issues with the through road as well, which could be addressed with a different method.

843
01:33:19,098 --> 01:33:21,359
[SPEAKER_37]: That specific is not relevant to this meeting.

844
01:33:21,939 --> 01:33:27,041
[SPEAKER_37]: But I also agree with Kyle and the first Diane about the environmental issue.

845
01:33:27,821 --> 01:33:33,383
[SPEAKER_37]: I have some neighbors who have spent their entire lives right here.

846
01:33:34,884 --> 01:33:41,826
[SPEAKER_37]: In the 1950s, probably going back further, there was a man named Stanley Dudek who swept the streets of Medford.

847
01:33:42,646 --> 01:33:44,147
[SPEAKER_37]: There were no street sweepers at the time.

848
01:33:45,187 --> 01:33:46,608
[SPEAKER_37]: He dumped

849
01:33:47,772 --> 01:33:50,913
[SPEAKER_37]: whatever he collected into the Walkland Court property.

850
01:33:51,313 --> 01:33:53,373
[SPEAKER_37]: That is why it is known as the dump.

851
01:33:54,233 --> 01:33:57,854
[SPEAKER_37]: There was no environmental study done when this was built in the early 60s.

852
01:33:58,574 --> 01:34:05,795
[SPEAKER_37]: And we have grave concerns about contamination of this site, which need to be addressed before any zoning is changed.

853
01:34:09,536 --> 01:34:13,137
[SPEAKER_37]: This is a very serious issue for those of us who live here.

854
01:34:14,247 --> 01:34:30,683
[SPEAKER_37]: And again, better communication with the neighbors could have addressed this issue earlier, but, well, suffice it to say that many of us do not feel that the meetings with the Medford Housing Authority were productive.

855
01:34:31,704 --> 01:34:32,064
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

856
01:34:35,207 --> 01:34:35,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Anita.

857
01:34:37,678 --> 01:34:51,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to put out a call to anyone who hasn't raised their hand who wants to speak, or if there's anyone who's having trouble raising their hand, wants to use the chat function to let us know that you want to contribute.

858
01:34:53,308 --> 01:34:54,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give everyone a moment.

859
01:34:55,009 --> 01:34:57,331
[SPEAKER_03]: While we do that, there were some

860
01:34:58,495 --> 01:35:01,297
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, actually, I see a hand raised by two folks.

861
01:35:02,999 --> 01:35:08,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Sneha Kaunt, could you state your name and address for the record?

862
01:35:08,283 --> 01:35:10,004
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll have three minutes to provide a comment.

863
01:35:16,009 --> 01:35:16,609
[SPEAKER_39]: Hi.

864
01:35:16,649 --> 01:35:17,590
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you so much.

865
01:35:20,273 --> 01:35:24,916
[SPEAKER_39]: My name is Sneha Kaun and my address is 108 Medford Street.

866
01:35:26,036 --> 01:35:37,341
[SPEAKER_39]: I just like to sort of just add in my voice about the environmental impact concern, but sort of different in terms of what's been raised so far.

867
01:35:37,361 --> 01:35:41,083
[SPEAKER_39]: So I feel that adding more housing would actually help.

868
01:35:42,122 --> 01:35:44,064
[SPEAKER_39]: environmental and sustainability goals.

869
01:35:44,144 --> 01:36:01,079
[SPEAKER_39]: If we have more people living in urban areas as opposed to sort of sprawling out and facing more scarce housing, that's actually in terms of sort of more sustainable goals, that's scientifically proven to be better for environmental goals.

870
01:36:01,919 --> 01:36:06,543
[SPEAKER_39]: And I also think that this sort of concern for the

871
01:36:07,888 --> 01:36:21,861
[SPEAKER_39]: The idea that digging up for building higher would raise new problems in terms of contaminants, but it seems that whatever level of construction is going to be done is also going to

872
01:36:22,718 --> 01:36:23,819
[SPEAKER_39]: create the same problem.

873
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:27,584
[SPEAKER_39]: So do we just not build anything at all?

874
01:36:27,764 --> 01:36:41,161
[SPEAKER_39]: So I'd just like to sum up my public comment as saying that I think building more housing, especially deeply affordable housing, as this project suggests, is a really good idea for our community's environmental goals.

875
01:36:41,481 --> 01:36:41,862
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

876
01:36:45,017 --> 01:36:46,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Sneha.

877
01:36:47,278 --> 01:36:49,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Next in the queue is Eileen Lerner.

878
01:36:49,098 --> 01:36:53,720
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could state your name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes to provide a comment.

879
01:36:55,221 --> 01:37:00,903
[SPEAKER_19]: So my name is Eileen Lerner, and I live at 9 Adams Circle in Medford.

880
01:37:03,670 --> 01:37:19,485
[SPEAKER_19]: Like everybody here, I think we all want to see more housing, especially for the elderly and disabled who are threatened with having to move when they're no longer able to function in their homes.

881
01:37:20,708 --> 01:37:27,056
[SPEAKER_19]: However, I worked at the Attorney General's office for a number of years in environmental protection.

882
01:37:28,157 --> 01:37:36,988
[SPEAKER_19]: And I worked on several cases, like the case of Wilburn, where the water was contaminated, you know, and

883
01:37:39,901 --> 01:37:45,664
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm certainly familiar with environmental impact statements, and I was really shocked.

884
01:37:45,824 --> 01:37:50,147
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm shocked that nobody's done an environmental impact statement.

885
01:37:52,901 --> 01:37:53,401
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

886
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:58,523
[SPEAKER_19]: I wouldn't want to live in a site which had been a gas station.

887
01:37:59,124 --> 01:38:08,267
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, who knows the possibilities for disease that could come from pollution?

888
01:38:08,568 --> 01:38:12,069
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't think it's a minor concern.

889
01:38:13,410 --> 01:38:16,151
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to see people housed safely.

890
01:38:16,171 --> 01:38:21,113
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to see them housed in a place where we we don't really know.

891
01:38:22,053 --> 01:38:24,396
[SPEAKER_19]: Are they going to be harmed by fumes?

892
01:38:24,576 --> 01:38:26,598
[SPEAKER_19]: Are they going to be harmed by the water?

893
01:38:27,919 --> 01:38:33,585
[SPEAKER_19]: I think absolutely zoning should not happen unless there's an environmental impact statement.

894
01:38:34,526 --> 01:38:34,966
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

895
01:38:34,986 --> 01:38:38,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Eileen.

896
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:49,122
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to also, I think we forgot to mention that if you're on a phone, you can press star nine to raise your hand.

897
01:38:50,262 --> 01:38:55,023
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we want to give everyone a moment, oh, I see a hand raised.

898
01:38:55,163 --> 01:38:58,484
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is number 7813965138.

899
01:38:58,864 --> 01:39:04,585
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could say your name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes to provide comment.

900
01:39:08,539 --> 01:39:12,680
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, and if you're on the phone, you'll have to do star six to unmute.

901
01:39:12,940 --> 01:39:13,540
[SPEAKER_21]: There, you got it.

902
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:14,680
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

903
01:39:15,020 --> 01:39:17,221
[SPEAKER_24]: This is Mariana Ducey at 2 Nod street.

904
01:39:17,921 --> 01:39:19,381
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, a couple of things.

905
01:39:19,601 --> 01:39:24,122
[SPEAKER_24]: I gave you people today, um, a six page letter with concerns here.

906
01:39:24,682 --> 01:39:28,403
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll just give you the quickies, um, point of clarification.

907
01:39:29,123 --> 01:39:34,864
[SPEAKER_24]: This, uh, zoning thing is set for, uh, stated one through 20 walk-in court.

908
01:39:35,304 --> 01:39:38,045
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a private home on two walk-in court.

909
01:39:38,825 --> 01:39:44,247
[SPEAKER_24]: It should, I don't believe it should be part of the walking court complex or the zoning for that because it's a private home.

910
01:39:44,307 --> 01:39:46,208
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not part of the walking court complex.

911
01:39:47,008 --> 01:39:47,909
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the first thing.

912
01:39:48,669 --> 01:39:52,831
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, the second thing is that we've done a, um, a petition in my neighborhood.

913
01:39:53,554 --> 01:40:02,038
[SPEAKER_24]: I've got, I turned in to you people today, 1,131 signatures of people opposed to the current design.

914
01:40:02,618 --> 01:40:09,502
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not that we're opposed to redeveloping the lot or even upgrading the lot or whatever you decide to do with the lot.

915
01:40:10,182 --> 01:40:20,107
[SPEAKER_24]: But when I showed everyone the design and explained what buildings, how the buildings were going to be used, they signed it immediately.

916
01:40:20,127 --> 01:40:22,368
[SPEAKER_24]: 99% of the people I approached,

917
01:40:23,257 --> 01:40:23,997
[SPEAKER_24]: in this neighborhood.

918
01:40:24,878 --> 01:40:30,560
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, everybody understands that we need more housing within reason.

919
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:42,444
[SPEAKER_24]: People feel as though, for one thing, that they don't like the fact that the seniors who occupy the whole lot are being pushed up into buildings against the railroad tracks, where today they have the whole lot.

920
01:40:43,264 --> 01:40:44,725
[SPEAKER_24]: They get the worst part of the lot.

921
01:40:45,646 --> 01:41:06,028
[SPEAKER_24]: uh... the second thing is that people feel there's too much being crammed into two small land area you occupy all the space there with buildings uh... the third thing is people don't like the six-story buildings in a residential neighborhood here i mean with this is not just one person speaking this is eleven hundred people speaking

922
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:08,982
[SPEAKER_24]: So you need to consider these things.

923
01:41:09,443 --> 01:41:13,527
[SPEAKER_24]: Just remember, we are not opposed to putting housing here.

924
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:15,228
[SPEAKER_24]: We understand that there's a need.

925
01:41:15,669 --> 01:41:20,874
[SPEAKER_24]: However, there's also the concerns of the adjacent neighborhood that have to be considered.

926
01:41:21,435 --> 01:41:21,735
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

927
01:41:24,518 --> 01:41:25,638
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Marianne.

928
01:41:25,899 --> 01:41:31,281
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for summarizing the petition, which we did receive and which was distributed to the board.

929
01:41:32,681 --> 01:41:41,004
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go over the other comments that we received before the meeting after we hear from everyone on the call.

930
01:41:42,545 --> 01:41:45,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And next in our queue is M Paige Lieberman.

931
01:41:46,966 --> 01:41:50,908
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could state your full name for the record and address, you'll have three minutes to comment.

932
01:41:53,485 --> 01:41:54,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, hi.

933
01:41:54,706 --> 01:41:56,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm another person who lives in public housing.

934
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:59,550
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Matthew Page Lieberman, I live in 15 Canal Street.

935
01:42:00,151 --> 01:42:01,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm extremely excited about this.

936
01:42:04,292 --> 01:42:09,296
[SPEAKER_04]: been knowing about it thanks to Roberta, who heads up a lot of the work that we do in Housing Medford.

937
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:27,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of this kind of late in the meeting, it is a little unfortunate because so many people came before me that said these beautiful things that I could just basically say I agree with their sentiment, specifically what Diane said, Diane Sullivan, about the matter of

938
01:42:28,793 --> 01:42:29,594
[SPEAKER_04]: using proxies.

939
01:42:31,275 --> 01:42:32,136
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very relevant.

940
01:42:32,156 --> 01:42:34,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we've heard now that there were 1,100 signatures.

941
01:42:35,218 --> 01:42:37,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Last night, it was only about 1,000 signatures.

942
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:48,247
[SPEAKER_04]: And we keep hearing from people that won't actually be directly affected by this, talking about how they know that there are people in the neighborhood who are upset and they're against this.

943
01:42:48,808 --> 01:42:52,691
[SPEAKER_04]: It's almost like I'm getting ready to hear somebody say, my black friends, my black friends say this.

944
01:42:52,731 --> 01:42:53,931
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, where are your black friends?

945
01:42:53,971 --> 01:42:54,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are they?

946
01:42:55,546 --> 01:43:04,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it kind of goes without saying that when it comes to petitions, there's a little bit of pressure that goes on.

947
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:08,151
[SPEAKER_04]: And so yeah, it goes without saying.

948
01:43:08,171 --> 01:43:18,695
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know for a fact there are many, many people that sign a petition who they heard this threat narrative, and they didn't want to upset the person who's hassling them to put their signatures down on the paper.

949
01:43:20,115 --> 01:43:22,056
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have no idea.

950
01:43:22,096 --> 01:43:23,136
[SPEAKER_04]: None of us know any idea.

951
01:43:23,156 --> 01:43:26,257
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do know for a fact that there are people who signed this petition who are against it.

952
01:43:26,677 --> 01:43:29,897
[SPEAKER_04]: But they still felt like, well, this person is going to get mad at me if I don't sign her petition.

953
01:43:30,558 --> 01:43:34,519
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet here we have, at this meeting today, where are all of the people?

954
01:43:34,859 --> 01:43:35,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are all the people?

955
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:42,941
[SPEAKER_04]: You would think if there's 1,100 people signed this thing, why are there only three or four people that have gotten into this meeting to say, we're opposed to this.

956
01:43:42,981 --> 01:43:44,281
[SPEAKER_04]: We're directly affected by it.

957
01:43:44,701 --> 01:43:49,062
[SPEAKER_04]: How is it the campaigners couldn't get these masses of people to show up here today and say this?

958
01:43:49,502 --> 01:43:50,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's kind of curious.

959
01:43:51,684 --> 01:43:54,587
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that we should all kind of put that in perspective.

960
01:43:54,647 --> 01:44:00,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, where are the really the people here tonight to really talk about how it's directly affecting them?

961
01:44:00,533 --> 01:44:09,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Not when you have people like they live in a different city, different city talking about how I don't actually live here, but it's going to better property that I have for some short term rental.

962
01:44:09,942 --> 01:44:11,383
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to really think about standing.

963
01:44:11,724 --> 01:44:16,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I'm really thankful for all the work that people have done, especially Ms.

964
01:44:16,107 --> 01:44:16,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Jansen.

965
01:44:16,668 --> 01:44:20,050
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being from Cambridge and guiding us with this work.

966
01:44:20,471 --> 01:44:21,131
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really good.

967
01:44:21,151 --> 01:44:27,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, I live in public housing, and perhaps my unit will get replaced someday, and we'll have stuff modernized.

968
01:44:27,916 --> 01:44:31,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this modernized stuff looks extremely great, extremely great.

969
01:44:31,139 --> 01:44:32,900
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really glad everybody's put this together.

970
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:33,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

971
01:44:35,642 --> 01:44:36,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Matthew.

972
01:44:38,565 --> 01:44:41,231
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm not seeing any more hands at the moment.

973
01:44:43,116 --> 01:44:43,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

974
01:44:45,083 --> 01:44:51,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe I have a, I think there's a hand, I'm not sure if this was just from previously from Marianne, it's still up.

975
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:59,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we go there, I do want to take a moment to just mention the comments that were received prior to the meeting.

976
01:44:59,916 --> 01:45:11,886
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always been, already been referenced to the petition with 1,131 signatures, which Marianna Ducey outlined, was submitted to us today and was provided to the board ahead of the meeting.

977
01:45:13,007 --> 01:45:25,891
[SPEAKER_03]: We also received a comment from David Peters at, if I can get the address, 17 North Street, voicing some concerns that he discussed in the meeting tonight as well.

978
01:45:26,992 --> 01:45:39,876
[SPEAKER_03]: And in addition to that, we received 78 resident support letters from the Medford Housing Authority, which outline their support for the project in general.

979
01:45:41,887 --> 01:45:46,812
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do see this hand still raised for, I think it's Mariana Ducey.

980
01:45:46,892 --> 01:45:53,278
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you could state your name and address for the record once more, and again, three minutes.

981
01:46:03,568 --> 01:46:05,510
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, it's Mariana again.

982
01:46:06,393 --> 01:46:20,465
[SPEAKER_24]: I wish you could just explain to the previous caller that the reason that so few people may have called in tonight is because the notices only went out to people within 400 feet of the complex that this meeting was going to be held tonight.

983
01:46:20,806 --> 01:46:25,209
[SPEAKER_24]: Even though you published a notice in the newspaper, not everybody gets a newspaper.

984
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:31,034
[SPEAKER_24]: So the fact that there aren't a lot of people on the call is not indicative that there isn't a lot of interest.

985
01:46:31,535 --> 01:46:34,017
[SPEAKER_24]: And as far as the way the petition was collected,

986
01:46:34,733 --> 01:46:37,075
[SPEAKER_24]: I did not pressure anyone to sign anything.

987
01:46:37,095 --> 01:46:42,358
[SPEAKER_24]: I explained the thing that some people said they weren't interested in signing, and that's fine.

988
01:46:42,858 --> 01:46:49,342
[SPEAKER_24]: So the tactics I used were very neutral.

989
01:46:49,743 --> 01:46:52,444
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I didn't express my own opinion or anything.

990
01:46:52,525 --> 01:46:54,206
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just want to clarify that.

991
01:46:54,226 --> 01:46:57,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mary Ann.

992
01:47:00,734 --> 01:47:04,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and with that, I believe that is all of our comment for this evening.

993
01:47:10,184 --> 01:47:11,105
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Amanda.

994
01:47:12,987 --> 01:47:16,230
[SPEAKER_30]: At this time, I'm going to ask if the board has any other questions.

995
01:47:18,533 --> 01:47:23,518
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm going to actually first before the board, I'll close the public comment period.

996
01:47:25,332 --> 01:47:28,973
[SPEAKER_30]: and then ask the board if there's any other questions that you have.

997
01:47:29,673 --> 01:47:43,498
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam Chair, can I just suggest perhaps you wanna give the MHA the opportunity to respond to those comments before you close the public comment period, just in case that triggers more confusion that somebody needs clarity on.

998
01:47:43,638 --> 01:47:44,859
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, and I apologize.

999
01:47:44,899 --> 01:47:49,560
[SPEAKER_30]: We originally said that we were gonna answer them case by case, but Amanda has helped me to collect them.

1000
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:54,802
[SPEAKER_30]: And Amanda, have you collected the ones that were relevant to tonight's public hearing?

1001
01:47:56,831 --> 01:47:57,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yeah.

1002
01:47:58,692 --> 01:48:00,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, just pulling up my notes here.

1003
01:48:01,653 --> 01:48:01,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1004
01:48:02,074 --> 01:48:03,294
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a couple.

1005
01:48:05,015 --> 01:48:17,681
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a couple of comments asking about, has there been or will there be an environmental assessment of the site or an impact study relating to contamination at the site?

1006
01:48:22,552 --> 01:48:26,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm I'm going to leave if you're prepared, I'm going to let you speak to this.

1007
01:48:26,595 --> 01:48:35,142
[SPEAKER_13]: But, yes, we have completed what's called phase 1 environmental site assessments and a phase 2 environmental site assessments.

1008
01:48:35,662 --> 01:48:43,408
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're also going through HUD's environmental review process, but I'll let Lee speak to some of the particulars on that.

1009
01:48:45,022 --> 01:48:45,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Gabe.

1010
01:48:46,223 --> 01:48:54,150
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Lee Morissette, principal architect at Dietzen Company Architecture and leader of the design team for the Medford Housing Authority.

1011
01:48:55,471 --> 01:49:02,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we have already performed the initial steps of testing on site for soils and other contaminants.

1012
01:49:03,638 --> 01:49:09,680
[SPEAKER_01]: both some building contaminants as part of the original construction, but more specifically, environmental contaminants within the soils.

1013
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:30,065
[SPEAKER_01]: That first phase of investigation has been filed, as Gabe said, as a phase one with the state, which prompted a phase two, which is the next step, you know, what do we do with these things now that we've found certain contaminants on site, which we're actually engaged in right now with our environmental engineer.

1014
01:49:32,085 --> 01:49:35,366
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe Kevin McGarry is still with us on the phone.

1015
01:49:35,666 --> 01:49:42,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin McGarry from Fust & O'Neill heads up both the civil engineering and the environmental engineering aspects of our project.

1016
01:49:43,308 --> 01:49:54,932
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can hand it over to you in just a second, but the phase two process involves additional sampling, testing, and evaluation of the materials that are on site.

1017
01:49:56,232 --> 01:50:04,737
[SPEAKER_01]: as it relates to the construction that will happen and cleanup associated with construction to meet the state and national standards for best practices.

1018
01:50:06,058 --> 01:50:10,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to provide one bit of clarification to a number of the questions that happened regarding

1019
01:50:13,082 --> 01:50:14,982
[SPEAKER_01]: historic contaminants that may have been on the site.

1020
01:50:16,323 --> 01:50:26,364
[SPEAKER_01]: The phase one or phase two in regards to environmental assessment were not a part of the PDD application process, and that's why they weren't included in the PDD.

1021
01:50:26,404 --> 01:50:28,625
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not required as a part of this filing.

1022
01:50:28,705 --> 01:50:32,585
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they have been filed through the public agencies and are available as public record.

1023
01:50:33,446 --> 01:50:35,386
[SPEAKER_01]: The phase one at this point, phase two is still ongoing.

1024
01:50:36,066 --> 01:50:37,526
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin, is there anything you'd like to add to that?

1025
01:50:38,466 --> 01:50:39,827
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Lee.

1026
01:50:39,987 --> 01:50:41,627
[SPEAKER_36]: Can everybody hear me okay?

1027
01:50:42,938 --> 01:50:46,120
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm keeping my camera off because I just have some bandwidth issues.

1028
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:48,961
[SPEAKER_36]: So just for the record, so I'm Kevin McGarry.

1029
01:50:48,981 --> 01:50:53,643
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm a project manager with Fossil and I am a professional engineer in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1030
01:50:54,864 --> 01:51:03,668
[SPEAKER_36]: The only thing I'll add to this, when Lee was saying it was submitted to the state, so I'm a professional engineer, Lee is a registered architect.

1031
01:51:04,372 --> 01:51:08,254
[SPEAKER_36]: Fossil and Renewal also employs what's called licensed site professionals.

1032
01:51:08,454 --> 01:51:14,117
[SPEAKER_36]: And those are the people who are licensed to deal with environmental contaminants within the soil.

1033
01:51:14,758 --> 01:51:20,841
[SPEAKER_36]: And all that is done through what's called the Massachusetts Contingency Plan, which is administered through MassDEP.

1034
01:51:20,901 --> 01:51:22,802
[SPEAKER_36]: And it's an extremely prescriptive process.

1035
01:51:23,642 --> 01:51:32,267
[SPEAKER_36]: We will have to get approved through MassDEP any soil management that needs to happen on the site for anything that's impacted.

1036
01:51:36,348 --> 01:51:44,476
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to add quickly that the phase 1 and the phase 2 ESAs are described in the PDD application that we submitted.

1037
01:51:44,496 --> 01:51:45,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Natalie.

1038
01:51:46,058 --> 01:51:47,079
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that clarification.

1039
01:51:47,099 --> 01:51:47,379
[SPEAKER_01]: My mistake.

1040
01:51:50,488 --> 01:51:52,329
[SPEAKER_26]: And I just wanted to, this is Margaret Moran.

1041
01:51:52,349 --> 01:52:06,253
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm the deputy executive director for the Cambridge housing authority, serving as development consultant for metric housing story in the walking court project just to touch upon the environmental review process and the findings of that.

1042
01:52:07,154 --> 01:52:10,375
[SPEAKER_26]: And that process has been underway and that.

1043
01:52:10,775 --> 01:52:29,023
[SPEAKER_26]: There are certain times where that process would trigger a more detailed environmental impact statement, but the environmental assessment findings have not triggered anything that would require anything to that extent.

1044
01:52:29,123 --> 01:52:39,107
[SPEAKER_26]: But we're complying with all of the environmental regulatory requirements for all aspects of the project and will continue to do so.

1045
01:52:43,408 --> 01:52:43,588
[SPEAKER_30]: Ms.

1046
01:52:43,628 --> 01:52:48,574
[SPEAKER_30]: Moran, for clarification, when you said it would trigger something higher, can you be more specific for the public?

1047
01:52:48,654 --> 01:52:53,801
[SPEAKER_30]: Were you speaking about the MEPA office or anything dealing with the EEA in Massachusetts?

1048
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:58,967
[SPEAKER_30]: I just wanted the public to understand how detailed of an environmental assessment you have.

1049
01:52:59,307 --> 01:53:01,209
[SPEAKER_30]: done and what that entails.

1050
01:53:01,509 --> 01:53:23,347
[SPEAKER_26]: I mean, you look at all aspects of the site from its location near sensitive water or wetlands to coastal barriers, which isn't applicable in our neighborhood or noise, which is applicable because of the train tracks and just the car volume on Parkway.

1051
01:53:24,307 --> 01:53:27,350
[SPEAKER_26]: All of those things are carefully assessed and evaluated.

1052
01:53:28,134 --> 01:53:45,252
[SPEAKER_26]: To determine if any kind of further action is required, and there'll be some categories where we may need to do a little bit further work, like the phase 2 work that's going on right now, as it relates to the soils, or even some work related to.

1053
01:53:48,294 --> 01:53:51,796
[SPEAKER_26]: documenting the site for historic reasons.

1054
01:53:52,576 --> 01:54:06,204
[SPEAKER_26]: But every category they could ever possibly imagine is part of the assessment that is required to be performed as part of the use of the funding, both state and federal.

1055
01:54:07,568 --> 01:54:08,069
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1056
01:54:08,309 --> 01:54:13,932
[SPEAKER_30]: I appreciate that question, that clarification, especially where I wanted the public going back to Ms.

1057
01:54:13,952 --> 01:54:20,657
[SPEAKER_30]: Diane McKinney's reference to environmental justice area that MEPA actually has dedication.

1058
01:54:20,757 --> 01:54:27,722
[SPEAKER_30]: They have dedicated resources for projects that are near environmental justice populations, which I have clarified.

1059
01:54:29,028 --> 01:54:37,076
[SPEAKER_30]: In my error earlier, not realizing that this area was an environmental justice area, it's Block Group 1, Census Tract 3394, as you stated.

1060
01:54:38,017 --> 01:54:44,022
[SPEAKER_30]: And it's one of the criterias that the state uses for being environmental justice is that it's hugely minority.

1061
01:54:44,663 --> 01:54:48,747
[SPEAKER_30]: I just wanted to put that on the record for the public information.

1062
01:54:50,238 --> 01:54:51,619
[SPEAKER_30]: Sorry, Amanda, if you can continue.

1063
01:54:51,639 --> 01:54:52,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure thing.

1064
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:58,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Next question we have was, has the applicant, what has the applicant heard from tenants?

1065
01:54:59,743 --> 01:55:15,272
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some concerns raised in the petition and anecdotally via comments here that regarding, you know, tenants feeling comfortable sharing information or sharing their opinions on the development project.

1066
01:55:18,803 --> 01:55:27,726
[SPEAKER_13]: So, as we stated kind of in our application, we've met at least 8 times with our residents since 2021.

1067
01:55:29,267 --> 01:55:33,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Regarding the proposed redevelopment, I've attended every 1 of those meetings.

1068
01:55:35,369 --> 01:55:38,810
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to think that I have a very good rapport with our residents.

1069
01:55:40,235 --> 01:55:43,236
[SPEAKER_13]: that they trust me, that they can come up to me with questions.

1070
01:55:43,336 --> 01:55:46,076
[SPEAKER_13]: I get constant calls from them, emails from them.

1071
01:55:46,096 --> 01:55:51,078
[SPEAKER_13]: If they don't think they have a question during a meeting, they call me or email me the next day.

1072
01:55:52,798 --> 01:56:01,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Overwhelmingly, I have seen or the staff has seen overwhelming support for this project.

1073
01:56:03,721 --> 01:56:12,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, anyone can say, well, you're the housing authority, so they feel coerced into acting like they support it.

1074
01:56:12,395 --> 01:56:15,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Like the statement, people feel coerced into signing a petition.

1075
01:56:18,981 --> 01:56:33,432
[SPEAKER_13]: But we've had city staff at our resident meetings, and I think anybody that attends one of our resident meetings can see the great relationship that our staff has with our residents, the open dialogue.

1076
01:56:33,572 --> 01:56:36,374
[SPEAKER_13]: Our residents have never been forced to sign anything.

1077
01:56:36,754 --> 01:56:42,339
[SPEAKER_13]: They've never been coerced into feeling a certain way or showing support.

1078
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:51,884
[SPEAKER_13]: I have witnessed overwhelming support for the redevelopment of Whatcom Court because these are residents that live on site.

1079
01:56:52,184 --> 01:56:53,884
[SPEAKER_13]: They know the building conditions.

1080
01:56:54,325 --> 01:57:06,590
[SPEAKER_13]: They know that how many reasonable accommodations we get from residents to move from a second floor unit to a first floor unit as they age on site.

1081
01:57:06,730 --> 01:57:13,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, the existing residents of Whatcom Court overwhelmingly support the proposed redevelopment.

1082
01:57:17,078 --> 01:57:21,026
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, I'll keep moving through unless people feel free to interrupt me.

1083
01:57:22,509 --> 01:57:28,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Will the project, is the project planning to have solar installed on any of the roofs?

1084
01:57:31,628 --> 01:57:34,610
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, I can jump in and answer this pretty quickly.

1085
01:57:34,971 --> 01:57:46,039
[SPEAKER_01]: The current state building code requires us to prewire multifamily residential buildings for solar, so it's going to be set up for solar regardless.

1086
01:57:46,779 --> 01:57:53,824
[SPEAKER_01]: We are currently planning to put solar panels on the second phase, which is in the future

1087
01:57:55,846 --> 01:58:03,709
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the second half, the townhouses and the family apartment building in the middle are anticipated to have solar.

1088
01:58:03,869 --> 01:58:08,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're currently doing a test fit for solar on the senior building right now.

1089
01:58:09,111 --> 01:58:11,852
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of pressure for things to go on the roof, as you can imagine.

1090
01:58:12,532 --> 01:58:15,474
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, it is required that we analyze that.

1091
01:58:16,834 --> 01:58:23,057
[SPEAKER_26]: And Lee, can you talk about it, about the use of all electric and what that does to the environment as well?

1092
01:58:23,762 --> 01:58:24,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.

1093
01:58:24,262 --> 01:58:25,643
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good point, Margaret.

1094
01:58:25,663 --> 01:58:25,963
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1095
01:58:26,884 --> 01:58:37,308
[SPEAKER_01]: The senior housing building, which is the first phase of design and construction, that's the six-story building nearest the MBTA railroad tracks that is all senior housing.

1096
01:58:37,869 --> 01:58:44,632
[SPEAKER_01]: That entire apartment building, all of the heating, cooling, and ventilation will be electrically powered.

1097
01:58:45,072 --> 01:58:50,814
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not any fossil fuels burned for the heating, cooling, or ventilation for that part of the building.

1098
01:58:51,494 --> 01:59:04,157
[SPEAKER_01]: It's through a high-performance variable refrigerant flow is the name of the system, but it's the mini-splits like the Mitsubishi kind of air conditioners you might have in your house, but at a very large scale.

1099
01:59:04,517 --> 01:59:06,798
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefit of it being all electric is that

1100
01:59:07,678 --> 01:59:10,119
[SPEAKER_01]: it's much less intensive on the environment.

1101
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:18,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there are solar panels on the roof, it contributes directly to offsetting the energy needs for that particular use.

1102
01:59:24,005 --> 01:59:24,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

1103
01:59:24,825 --> 01:59:26,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to keep moving.

1104
01:59:26,466 --> 01:59:36,350
[SPEAKER_03]: So another question was sort of why six stories for the senior facility versus the original four stories?

1105
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:42,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Natalie, do you want to take that one?

1106
01:59:43,341 --> 01:59:43,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Or shall I?

1107
01:59:44,922 --> 01:59:45,662
[SPEAKER_18]: I can take that.

1108
01:59:45,682 --> 01:59:55,767
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, the goal of the Walkland Court redevelopment, especially relates to the senior disabled portion is to provide the replacement units for 144.

1109
01:59:58,240 --> 01:59:59,942
[SPEAKER_18]: existing households on site.

1110
02:00:00,082 --> 02:00:05,225
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we're also adding 54 new deeply affordable units.

1111
02:00:06,066 --> 02:00:12,030
[SPEAKER_18]: Part of the key issue of Wackling Court right now is the lack of elevator access.

1112
02:00:12,230 --> 02:00:19,315
[SPEAKER_18]: And so once you start to look at adding elevators, there's an economy of scale when you're building taller

1113
02:00:20,692 --> 02:00:23,953
[SPEAKER_18]: um, in order to afford that construction.

1114
02:00:24,993 --> 02:00:33,254
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, going up to six stories to allows us to have more open space because it creates for a more efficient building.

1115
02:00:34,834 --> 02:00:45,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and then, you know, in terms of, you know, the six stories overall, there's, um, an economics piece in order to make the project financeable.

1116
02:00:45,936 --> 02:00:48,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, that includes, you know, being able to provide the 144 units

1117
02:00:50,053 --> 02:01:03,421
[SPEAKER_18]: and the 54 units on top of that, you know, essentially brings the project to a scale where we can gather the public resources, funding resources needed in order to make the project happen.

1118
02:01:05,575 --> 02:01:17,910
[SPEAKER_26]: I was just going to add that the units are at the current walking quarter, very undersized to today's standards are about 420 square feet.

1119
02:01:18,411 --> 02:01:23,737
[SPEAKER_26]: So, for elders who are aging in place, the ability to actually use a walker.

1120
02:01:25,118 --> 02:01:29,260
[SPEAKER_26]: We already talked about the fact that they're not handicapped accessible, so they're not wheelchair accessible.

1121
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:39,063
[SPEAKER_26]: But for folks who use walkers or canes, you really cannot maneuver through the kitchens or the bathroom areas successfully with that limited space.

1122
02:01:40,083 --> 02:01:46,065
[SPEAKER_26]: The new design with the new standards for construction actually size up the units from 420 to

1123
02:01:47,669 --> 02:01:52,051
[SPEAKER_26]: 25 square feet to approximately 575 square feet.

1124
02:01:52,111 --> 02:02:04,317
[SPEAKER_26]: So that just the simple math of adding almost 200 square feet, 150 or 200 square feet per unit requires the building massing.

1125
02:02:04,657 --> 02:02:07,879
[SPEAKER_26]: And then as Natalie was pointing out, we've been very mindful about

1126
02:02:09,120 --> 02:02:11,001
[SPEAKER_26]: trying to maximize open space.

1127
02:02:11,021 --> 02:02:24,649
[SPEAKER_26]: The first floor of the high-rise building is actually structured parking or podium parking, so that only a portion of the first floor is actually habitable community space.

1128
02:02:25,109 --> 02:02:29,912
[SPEAKER_26]: No apartments are there, so it's only five floors of residential apartments.

1129
02:02:30,573 --> 02:02:35,536
[SPEAKER_26]: I think those all contribute when you're trying to balance a lot of different competing needs that

1130
02:02:36,056 --> 02:02:42,945
[SPEAKER_26]: A lot of things were solved by going up to the 6 story height and we've always been 6 stories.

1131
02:02:43,345 --> 02:02:51,555
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know of an instance where you ever showed anything less than 6 stories back when we were planning doing the conceptual design for the project.

1132
02:02:52,523 --> 02:03:21,022
[SPEAKER_26]: We had kind of looked at a variety of things, but concluded that six stories kind of balanced all the competing needs and issues of the site to allow for the added additional elderly units, which are greatly needed in the community, but also the potential benefit of those family units, particularly the family units in the three-story elevator building that's lacking in affordable housing inventory in Medford.

1133
02:03:23,535 --> 02:03:23,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1134
02:03:24,015 --> 02:03:43,321
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe a lot of that answer from Margaret and Natalie speaks to one of the other questions, which was sort of more generally about why not a more limited in scope renovation, adding nine elevators versus something, well, versus what's being proposed.

1135
02:03:44,602 --> 02:03:46,082
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there's anything else you all want to add.

1136
02:03:46,382 --> 02:03:55,090
[SPEAKER_26]: I do want to speak to that because, you know, nine elevators require nine maintenance contracts, and elevator maintenance contracts are really expensive.

1137
02:03:55,130 --> 02:04:08,863
[SPEAKER_26]: And one of the things that state public housing doesn't have, it runs at a deficit every year, and it's very difficult for any housing authority in Massachusetts to have adequate funding to actually meet the operating needs of state public housing.

1138
02:04:09,293 --> 02:04:19,755
[SPEAKER_26]: And to add the nine elevator components would be cost prohibitive, not only from a first cost capital expense, but from an operating expense.

1139
02:04:19,795 --> 02:04:23,936
[SPEAKER_26]: And then in addition to that, as we've mentioned, the units are already very undersized.

1140
02:04:23,956 --> 02:04:29,697
[SPEAKER_26]: So you may be able to get through the door, but you're not going to be able to maneuver through the space and age gracefully.

1141
02:04:30,837 --> 02:04:32,438
[SPEAKER_26]: And so those factors combine.

1142
02:04:32,478 --> 02:04:38,179
[SPEAKER_26]: And then the fact that they're not energy efficient, they don't have any meaningful insulation.

1143
02:04:39,104 --> 02:04:48,767
[SPEAKER_26]: They are aging where structural issues and building envelope issues will require a soup to nuts type of renovation.

1144
02:04:49,267 --> 02:05:04,592
[SPEAKER_26]: It's been my experience that as you go through that process with a building that age that has not aged very well, that it actually is more costly to rehab it than it actually is to potentially replace it.

1145
02:05:04,652 --> 02:05:06,233
[SPEAKER_26]: And by replacing, you're able to fix

1146
02:05:07,236 --> 02:05:14,049
[SPEAKER_26]: all of the inherent things that are wrong with it, including some of the sustainability and energy related issues.

1147
02:05:17,256 --> 02:05:17,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1148
02:05:18,076 --> 02:05:20,837
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think just two more on my list here.

1149
02:05:21,297 --> 02:05:24,338
[SPEAKER_03]: One is just a note that there was a question about the project address.

1150
02:05:24,498 --> 02:05:31,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And to clarify, it is 1 and 3 through 20 Walkling Court, so omitting the 2 Walkling Court.

1151
02:05:32,941 --> 02:05:44,985
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last comment, question that I have is, you know, in the words of the resident, why is it that the worst part of the lot is reserved for seniors?

1152
02:05:49,923 --> 02:05:53,009
[SPEAKER_18]: So, in part, when we were looking at doing, I can speak to that.

1153
02:05:53,210 --> 02:05:54,432
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, go ahead.

1154
02:05:54,452 --> 02:05:54,713
[SPEAKER_18]: Kim.

1155
02:05:57,298 --> 02:05:58,100
[SPEAKER_13]: No, you go Natalie.

1156
02:05:58,140 --> 02:05:58,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1157
02:05:58,781 --> 02:05:59,021
[SPEAKER_13]: You got.

1158
02:06:00,346 --> 02:06:17,094
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so I was going to say that, um, well, one thing that we're looking, um, when doing the site layout is being mindful of the different uses around the site, uh, specifically that you have the two-story homes that are along Auburn Street and North Street on the north and the east.

1159
02:06:17,954 --> 02:06:29,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, so that way, the addition of the deeply affordable townhomes creates, you know, a nice buffer there and then bringing the senior mid-rise back towards the south of the site.

1160
02:06:30,179 --> 02:06:40,167
[SPEAKER_18]: where you have already a 62-foot building that is on the parcel that's adjacent across from the train tracks.

1161
02:06:40,207 --> 02:06:58,781
[SPEAKER_18]: That's a way of essentially designing this additional density in a way that takes into account some of the concerns around making sure that this new development and the added number of deeply affordable units reflects the character of the neighborhood around it.

1162
02:07:04,908 --> 02:07:09,871
[SPEAKER_18]: And also, I mean, I think that it is on the south side of the site.

1163
02:07:12,372 --> 02:07:26,181
[SPEAKER_18]: The site, the mid-rise is being built in such a way that it will have the noise attenuation features needed to greatly improve noise quality on the site that is currently being experienced.

1164
02:07:26,201 --> 02:07:27,261
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to go tall.

1165
02:07:39,749 --> 02:07:41,110
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all of my notes.

1166
02:07:41,210 --> 02:07:47,737
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's anything else the applicant wanted to respond to that I didn't capture, I invite you.

1167
02:07:54,432 --> 02:08:06,041
[SPEAKER_26]: There was a comment made about the through road issue, and that was something that we talked at length about during the neighborhood meetings.

1168
02:08:06,521 --> 02:08:18,350
[SPEAKER_26]: Part of what is driving the orientation and layout of the road is the specific feedback we've gotten from the fire department and from emergency services in terms of their access to the site.

1169
02:08:18,370 --> 02:08:20,711
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we have to

1170
02:08:21,932 --> 02:08:35,263
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, kind of balance competing needs and wants and that one, you know, public safety, I think, is a real key catalyst to how the roadscape is being planned for the site.

1171
02:08:35,624 --> 02:08:39,427
[SPEAKER_26]: I just wanted to reference that because that was brought up in one of the comments.

1172
02:08:55,946 --> 02:09:01,630
[SPEAKER_30]: There's no other public comments at this time.

1173
02:09:01,791 --> 02:09:04,032
[SPEAKER_30]: Actually, I see one from an Anne.

1174
02:09:06,674 --> 02:09:12,638
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we've closed public comment period, and Anne has already provided comment.

1175
02:09:12,919 --> 02:09:13,699
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, awesome.

1176
02:09:13,719 --> 02:09:16,962
[SPEAKER_30]: All right, I will open it up.

1177
02:09:17,022 --> 02:09:19,183
[SPEAKER_30]: I will close the public comment.

1178
02:09:19,223 --> 02:09:25,388
[SPEAKER_30]: I will open it up for board members, and now I see Ari's hand.

1179
02:09:29,520 --> 02:09:29,960
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1180
02:09:33,905 --> 02:09:44,275
[SPEAKER_28]: My question was actually one comment that I think hadn't been addressed that I'd love to hear the response to was there were a few comments about trees.

1181
02:09:44,796 --> 02:09:46,958
[SPEAKER_28]: So I wanted them to have the opportunity to address it.

1182
02:09:55,678 --> 02:10:00,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Natalie, I'm going to give this a shot, and feel free to jump in if that's OK.

1183
02:10:01,980 --> 02:10:05,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently on site, there are a number of existing trees.

1184
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:21,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I have here the tree report that was commissioned by the Medford Housing Authority, specifically in response to concern about trees, the tree health on the site, and the longevity of the trees that are there.

1185
02:10:21,984 --> 02:10:24,445
[SPEAKER_01]: A detailed report was done by an arborist.

1186
02:10:25,185 --> 02:10:43,611
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluating every tree on site, there are approximately 50 of them, their approximate age, their species, their condition, and recommendations for their continued health, including pruning or occasionally removing, moving forward and relative to the development of the site.

1187
02:10:45,092 --> 02:10:50,954
[SPEAKER_01]: The development of this site covers enough of the landscape that it's going to affect many trees.

1188
02:10:52,008 --> 02:10:52,888
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the bottom line.

1189
02:10:53,088 --> 02:11:05,732
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to redevelop a site and change the building locations without bumping into the trees, especially when we go from two-story buildings that are relatively small in scale to larger buildings of four or six stories.

1190
02:11:06,992 --> 02:11:17,836
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it is our plan as a part of this application to replace in quantity all of the trees that are taken off of the site, including,

1191
02:11:19,136 --> 02:11:46,703
[SPEAKER_01]: in the case of some of the smaller fruit trees that were planted over the last couple of years, removing those trees because they're rather small and can be relocated during construction, and if possible, returning them to the site to be replanted, or the city and Medford Housing Authority has said that they would appreciate being able to plant those trees elsewhere throughout the city properties to beautify and benefit other communities as well if they do not

1192
02:11:48,063 --> 02:12:02,515
[SPEAKER_01]: if it made sense to not bring them back to the site and instead replace them with other types of trees that are both native species, because some of them on this list are considered non-native species, some might say invasive, but also

1193
02:12:03,696 --> 02:12:24,052
[SPEAKER_01]: to design the streetscape and the landscapes for trees that benefit the neighborhood over the long term, that provide good shade, but also visual security underneath them, so things that are appropriate for the scale of the site, and that can benefit the community over the long term, and be easy to maintain by the Benford Housing Authority.

1194
02:12:24,913 --> 02:12:27,615
[SPEAKER_01]: So in short, yes, many trees will be affected.

1195
02:12:28,035 --> 02:12:31,798
[SPEAKER_01]: We are doing our best to save and protect those that we can.

1196
02:12:32,679 --> 02:12:36,582
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've worked through this actually in a presentation with the community already.

1197
02:12:37,263 --> 02:12:41,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those that can't be saved or need to be removed as a part of the redevelopment of the site,

1198
02:12:42,387 --> 02:12:44,368
[SPEAKER_01]: we're proposing a replacement of those trees.

1199
02:12:44,588 --> 02:12:52,170
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the trees that are there, many of them are mature, and some of them are actually close to the end of their lives and making a bit of a mess, as trees do when they get to the end of their lives.

1200
02:12:52,631 --> 02:13:05,355
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the trees that will be replaced on site will obviously not be full mature trees, they'll be smaller trees, but we'll do our best to design and plant trees with their longevity in mind.

1201
02:13:05,435 --> 02:13:11,717
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting a tree that's big enough to survive, but not so big that it has a hard time acclimating to a new environment.

1202
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:13,920
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Mr. Morissette.

1203
02:13:14,001 --> 02:13:30,907
[SPEAKER_30]: And for Ari, as well as members of the public, this adverse report that Mr. Morissette is referring to was prepared by Urban Forestry Solutions Incorporated, and it was provided as exhibit F in the board materials and public materials for the project, if you want to go into further detail.

1204
02:13:32,348 --> 02:13:34,048
[SPEAKER_30]: Are there any other questions from the board?

1205
02:13:36,369 --> 02:13:37,650
[SPEAKER_33]: I've got one question.

1206
02:13:39,395 --> 02:13:48,879
[SPEAKER_33]: Has the MHA been in contact with the MBTA regarding, I saw on one of the slides, the Green Line Extension Phase 2 coming up to Route 9?

1207
02:13:50,880 --> 02:14:03,825
[SPEAKER_33]: Would the construction of this six-story building impede in any way in expanding the current two tracks to four tracks for the MBTA to have service up to Route 9, hopefully in the future?

1208
02:14:08,242 --> 02:14:24,891
[SPEAKER_18]: So that the potential expansion of the Green Line to Mystic River was something that I know that the MBTA has looked at and they've also looked at what the development, what kind of development demand it will create around that site.

1209
02:14:25,911 --> 02:14:37,818
[SPEAKER_18]: Specifically looking partially at Wakling Fort but also the Whole Foods site expecting to see a lot more development there of the kind of mixed use residential type.

1210
02:14:38,935 --> 02:14:41,437
[SPEAKER_18]: We are commencing conversations with the MBTA.

1211
02:14:41,477 --> 02:14:47,460
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a requirement around because the property abuts the railroad.

1212
02:14:48,501 --> 02:14:53,884
[SPEAKER_18]: There is an MBTA zone of influence that we have to respect as part of that.

1213
02:14:53,944 --> 02:14:55,085
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe it's 30 feet.

1214
02:14:57,166 --> 02:15:02,369
[SPEAKER_18]: And so, you know, whatever we do, the MBTA will be very well aware of

1215
02:15:04,337 --> 02:15:10,887
[SPEAKER_18]: but it should not impact their ability to expand the green line to Mystic River if they choose to do so.

1216
02:15:16,656 --> 02:15:17,036
[SPEAKER_33]: All right.

1217
02:15:17,096 --> 02:15:17,477
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1218
02:15:18,598 --> 02:15:19,460
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your question.

1219
02:15:28,981 --> 02:15:43,209
[SPEAKER_30]: If there are no other questions, I just wanted to thank Martha Helsing for your extensive detailed presentation as well as all of your consultant team.

1220
02:15:43,429 --> 02:15:57,937
[SPEAKER_30]: And because tonight's discussion is limited to many questions about language, et cetera, I'm going to just trust that attorney's own team with his extensive background in land use litigation and so forth in getting this amendment out.

1221
02:16:00,341 --> 02:16:07,144
[SPEAKER_30]: has already helped you to get to that so natural, faster, or the best path permanently going forward.

1222
02:16:07,604 --> 02:16:19,609
[SPEAKER_30]: So to get you started, I'm going to ask the board for a motion to recommend the drafted PDD rezoning ordinance for one and in three to 20 walk-in court to the city council.

1223
02:16:20,690 --> 02:16:21,590
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll make the motion.

1224
02:16:22,650 --> 02:16:23,491
[SPEAKER_30]: Do I hear a second?

1225
02:16:26,092 --> 02:16:26,392
[SPEAKER_30]: Second.

1226
02:16:30,425 --> 02:16:31,927
[SPEAKER_30]: Vice Chair Emily Hedeman.

1227
02:16:32,707 --> 02:16:32,827
[SPEAKER_30]: Aye.

1228
02:16:34,109 --> 02:16:34,789
[SPEAKER_30]: Ari Fishman.

1229
02:16:35,910 --> 02:16:36,070
[SPEAKER_30]: Aye.

1230
02:16:37,411 --> 02:16:38,332
[SPEAKER_30]: Pam Marianski.

1231
02:16:39,013 --> 02:16:39,113
[SPEAKER_30]: Aye.

1232
02:16:40,354 --> 02:16:42,336
[SPEAKER_30]: Chad Baracharia.

1233
02:16:43,217 --> 02:16:43,397
[SPEAKER_33]: Aye.

1234
02:16:44,218 --> 02:16:45,579
[SPEAKER_30]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1235
02:16:45,839 --> 02:16:46,039
[SPEAKER_30]: Aye.

1236
02:16:46,139 --> 02:16:53,226
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you so much and we look forward to doing our due diligence later after the revisions for the site plan review.

1237
02:16:57,278 --> 02:17:00,961
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much for meeting this evening.

1238
02:17:01,881 --> 02:17:03,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1239
02:17:03,903 --> 02:17:04,423
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1240
02:17:04,443 --> 02:17:05,624
[SPEAKER_31]: Have a great night.

1241
02:17:07,445 --> 02:17:08,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a nice evening.

1242
02:17:08,186 --> 02:17:08,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone.

1243
02:17:08,906 --> 02:17:09,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1244
02:17:11,408 --> 02:17:12,909
[SPEAKER_29]: Thanks to all the commenters too.

1245
02:17:13,510 --> 02:17:13,770
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1246
02:17:22,293 --> 02:17:28,661
[SPEAKER_30]: So our next item on the agenda is site plan review for 421 and 423 High Street.

1247
02:17:29,762 --> 02:17:31,284
[SPEAKER_30]: And I will read the public comment.

1248
02:17:40,383 --> 02:17:45,351
[SPEAKER_30]: The Metro Community Development Board shall conduct a meeting on September 6, 2023 after 6.30 p.m.

1249
02:17:45,411 --> 02:17:45,992
[SPEAKER_30]: via Zoom.

1250
02:17:46,573 --> 02:17:52,844
[SPEAKER_30]: Remote video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review submitted by RJM Development LLC.

1251
02:17:54,006 --> 02:18:13,971
[SPEAKER_30]: 37 West Street, Medford Mass, 02155, regarding construction of a nine-unit residential structure with approximately 1,000 square feet of commercial space located in both commercial one and single family one zoning districts at 421 to 423 High Street, Medford Mass, 02155, otherwise known as parcel number L-04-7879.

1252
02:18:25,031 --> 02:18:26,192
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, Madam Chair.

1253
02:18:26,472 --> 02:18:27,613
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm Kathleen Desmond.

1254
02:18:28,233 --> 02:18:34,617
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Richard Monigal, manager of RJM Development, LLC.

1255
02:18:35,297 --> 02:18:42,041
[SPEAKER_20]: And we are here to present to the board the proposed mixed-use project to be situated at 421-423 High Street, Medford.

1256
02:18:42,521 --> 02:18:46,003
[SPEAKER_20]: In addition to the applicant this evening, I'm also here with the design team.

1257
02:18:46,344 --> 02:18:47,384
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll introduce them now.

1258
02:18:47,544 --> 02:18:48,525
[SPEAKER_20]: Project architect,

1259
02:18:48,905 --> 02:18:52,346
[SPEAKER_20]: Milton Yu of Peter Quinn Architects of Somerville, Mass.

1260
02:18:52,386 --> 02:18:56,328
[SPEAKER_20]: Project Civil Engineer, Jack Sullivan of Sullivan Engineering Group, LLC.

1261
02:18:57,108 --> 02:19:01,289
[SPEAKER_20]: Landscape Architect, Natalie Adams of Verdant of Brookline, Mass.

1262
02:19:01,870 --> 02:19:09,072
[SPEAKER_20]: And last but not least, certainly our Project Traffic Engineer, Dan Mills of MDM Transportation Consultancy located in Marlborough.

1263
02:19:10,393 --> 02:19:16,475
[SPEAKER_20]: I will briefly give a little background to the scope of the project and then turn the presentation over to the design team.

1264
02:19:17,491 --> 02:19:21,354
[SPEAKER_20]: As indicated, the project is situated 421-423 High Street.

1265
02:19:21,894 --> 02:19:30,880
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an approximately 11,420 square foot parcel of land that formerly housed Sincada Funeral Home and also had a second floor apartment.

1266
02:19:31,440 --> 02:19:34,522
[SPEAKER_20]: The total gross floor area of that prior structure was 8,302 square feet.

1267
02:19:36,792 --> 02:19:40,696
[SPEAKER_20]: The parcel is situated in both the C1 and SF1 districts.

1268
02:19:41,456 --> 02:19:54,468
[SPEAKER_20]: The rear portion of the lot containing 6,892 square feet is located within the SF1 district and the front portion of the lot is situated within the C1 district containing approximately 4,680 square feet.

1269
02:19:57,050 --> 02:20:07,598
[SPEAKER_20]: Consistent with the location of the former funeral home, the proposed building will be situated wholly within the C-1 district that allows for both the commercial and multiple use as of right.

1270
02:20:08,479 --> 02:20:15,345
[SPEAKER_20]: The petitioner proposes to construct a mixed-use four-story structure with a gross floor area of approximately 13,724 square feet

1271
02:20:18,407 --> 02:20:32,093
[SPEAKER_20]: consisting, as indicated, of one commercial retail space with an approximate GFA of 1,091 square feet and nine residential units consisting of seven two-bedroom units and two one-bedroom units.

1272
02:20:32,573 --> 02:20:35,154
[SPEAKER_20]: Each unit will have access to an open area.

1273
02:20:36,195 --> 02:20:40,580
[SPEAKER_20]: As proposed, the parking area will be the rear of the building and for resident use only.

1274
02:20:40,600 --> 02:20:50,190
[SPEAKER_20]: The new zoning does not require adherence to minimum parking requirements with respect to non-residential uses where the gross leaseable floor space is less than 5,000 square feet.

1275
02:20:52,032 --> 02:21:09,273
[SPEAKER_20]: The proposed project site is situated in the heart of West Medford Business District and with immediate walking distance to the MBTA of West Medford Commuter Rail Station and bus routes 80, 90, and 95 that provide service to Medford Center Station, Sullivan Station, and Haymarket Square.

1276
02:21:10,022 --> 02:21:21,091
[SPEAKER_20]: The applicant did appear before the Zoning Board of Appeals with a request for zoning relief relating to front, side yard setbacks, lot width, usable open space, and lot coverage.

1277
02:21:21,672 --> 02:21:27,917
[SPEAKER_20]: The matter was presented to the ZBA on July 13th, 2023, and the request and relief was granted by the board.

1278
02:21:28,737 --> 02:21:35,223
[SPEAKER_20]: Filing of the written decision with the city clerk's office is pending, and it will be subject to a 20-day appeal period.

1279
02:21:36,443 --> 02:21:44,407
[SPEAKER_20]: With that, I'd like to turn the project over to Jack Sullivan, who can go through the specifics of the site plan with the board.

1280
02:21:45,268 --> 02:21:45,628
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1281
02:21:47,889 --> 02:21:49,050
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Attorney Desmond.

1282
02:21:49,570 --> 02:21:51,171
[SPEAKER_10]: For the record, my name is Jack Sullivan.

1283
02:21:51,211 --> 02:22:02,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm owner of the Sullivan Engineering Group, and I believe Milton from our project team, we have a presentation to present, if Milton can put that up on the screen, if he's able to share his screen.

1284
02:22:15,297 --> 02:22:19,379
[SPEAKER_16]: So for the record, do you see the screen now?

1285
02:22:22,680 --> 02:22:22,941
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1286
02:22:24,741 --> 02:22:24,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1287
02:22:26,202 --> 02:22:31,725
[SPEAKER_16]: So for the record, Milton Yu, Peter Quinn Architects, 259 Elm Street, Somerville, Davis Square.

1288
02:22:32,885 --> 02:22:41,029
[SPEAKER_16]: And I guess we'll start off with the overall site design choices that we've made.

1289
02:22:46,999 --> 02:22:54,425
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the existing site where this is the boundary.

1290
02:22:54,445 --> 02:22:57,788
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a little bit unusual shape boundary for the property.

1291
02:22:59,810 --> 02:23:11,540
[SPEAKER_16]: You'll see this, the existing footprint has forced that the cars coming in and out to this back area come between these two buildings on 425 to 427 and our building on 421.

1292
02:23:16,044 --> 02:23:23,969
[SPEAKER_16]: But the proposal seeks to remove a portion here to alter and improve the circulation, which we can get into more detail later.

1293
02:23:26,570 --> 02:23:41,119
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is the proposed dimensional site plan where the building is set back from this rear corner to the zoning compliant 15 feet minimum, I believe.

1294
02:23:41,660 --> 02:23:45,222
[SPEAKER_16]: So we get to meet that here, and then the proposed parking

1295
02:23:47,182 --> 02:23:57,532
[SPEAKER_16]: comes in this way, which it does already, but can exit out this lane, which is an existing driveway and existing curb cut.

1296
02:23:58,353 --> 02:24:03,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Jack, did you want to speak more to the civil drive?

1297
02:24:03,659 --> 02:24:04,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if you don't mind.

1298
02:24:04,640 --> 02:24:08,864
[SPEAKER_10]: If you just back up to the second sheet, Milton, and I'll take it from there.

1299
02:24:10,725 --> 02:24:12,066
[SPEAKER_10]: the existing conditions plan.

1300
02:24:12,086 --> 02:24:12,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1301
02:24:13,387 --> 02:24:14,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

1302
02:24:15,268 --> 02:24:19,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Attorney Desmond did a good job explaining the existing site condition.

1303
02:24:19,271 --> 02:24:25,455
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to add a few items to what she had talked about under the existing conditions.

1304
02:24:25,535 --> 02:24:33,880
[SPEAKER_10]: So to the left side of the existing building, the funeral home, there's an existing 10 foot right away.

1305
02:24:35,338 --> 02:24:40,701
[SPEAKER_10]: So with that 10-foot deeded right away, there's access to that rear parking area.

1306
02:24:42,102 --> 02:24:53,148
[SPEAKER_10]: To the right side of the building, which is the easterly side of the building, there's an 18-foot wide easement area that exists.

1307
02:24:53,548 --> 02:25:00,152
[SPEAKER_10]: These two areas will play into the future traffic circulation pattern that we generated for this site.

1308
02:25:01,134 --> 02:25:13,558
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanted to point out where the parking area is to the rear of this property, the back left corner, which is the northwesterly portion of the site, there's an existing drainage basin.

1309
02:25:15,819 --> 02:25:24,782
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't find any engineered plans of record showing for this to be put in, but at some point in time, someone developed a drainage basin.

1310
02:25:25,242 --> 02:25:26,923
[SPEAKER_10]: It consists of crushed stone.

1311
02:25:27,363 --> 02:25:30,124
[SPEAKER_10]: We dug a test pit out there six to seven feet deep.

1312
02:25:30,793 --> 02:25:32,753
[SPEAKER_10]: It was crushed stone throughout.

1313
02:25:34,794 --> 02:25:37,695
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were able to determine the seasonal high groundwater table.

1314
02:25:38,775 --> 02:25:45,036
[SPEAKER_10]: And as I get further along in the presentation, I'll address how we're dealing with the site drainage for this proposed development.

1315
02:25:45,916 --> 02:25:51,257
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did want to add that the majority of this site is impervious areas.

1316
02:25:51,538 --> 02:25:54,458
[SPEAKER_10]: It's either pavement or building roofs.

1317
02:25:55,078 --> 02:25:57,899
[SPEAKER_10]: There's very limited landscaping.

1318
02:25:59,827 --> 02:26:08,573
[SPEAKER_10]: I should note when we go into the proposed condition, we're reducing over 1,900 square feet of impervious surfaces and putting them back as green space.

1319
02:26:08,613 --> 02:26:12,997
[SPEAKER_10]: So that'll be an improvement in addition to the drainage improvements that I'll talk about.

1320
02:26:14,358 --> 02:26:16,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you go to the next page, Milton?

1321
02:26:16,199 --> 02:26:18,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1322
02:26:19,522 --> 02:26:21,143
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the general site plan.

1323
02:26:22,604 --> 02:26:27,668
[SPEAKER_10]: So as Attorney Desmond and Milton were saying, the proposed new four-story mixed-use building

1324
02:26:28,307 --> 02:26:30,808
[SPEAKER_10]: is in the same general vicinity of the funeral home.

1325
02:26:31,769 --> 02:26:37,972
[SPEAKER_10]: The rear parking lot, we're removing some of the impervious area, as I stated before.

1326
02:26:38,552 --> 02:26:40,833
[SPEAKER_10]: There'll be 10 total parking spaces.

1327
02:26:43,034 --> 02:26:46,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Nine of those spaces are conventional parking spaces.

1328
02:26:46,896 --> 02:26:51,799
[SPEAKER_10]: One is going to be a van accessible parking space with the associated eight foot aisle.

1329
02:26:52,932 --> 02:26:58,194
[SPEAKER_10]: And I should note that one of the comments that came back from the city is they'd like to see an EV space put in.

1330
02:26:58,254 --> 02:27:04,777
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of those conventional parking spaces will be designated an EV parking space in the future.

1331
02:27:06,037 --> 02:27:16,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the other site amenities with the site plan, we're going to provide 12 bicycle racks that they'll be covered in the rear and we show that on the plan.

1332
02:27:20,832 --> 02:27:25,035
[SPEAKER_10]: On the rear parking lot, we're going to install concrete curbing.

1333
02:27:25,696 --> 02:27:33,962
[SPEAKER_10]: The standard parking stall spaces will be 9 by 19 feet, which is the minimum requirements of the city.

1334
02:27:33,982 --> 02:27:38,485
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you could go to the next page, Milton.

1335
02:27:38,505 --> 02:27:45,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so this is a civil design plan.

1336
02:27:45,150 --> 02:27:47,332
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a grading drainage and utility plan.

1337
02:27:48,269 --> 02:27:53,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, so we get into, if you could use zoom in on that a bit on the plan section, the upper left.

1338
02:27:53,977 --> 02:27:54,698
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep, that's good.

1339
02:27:56,140 --> 02:28:00,406
[SPEAKER_10]: So, with this plan, you can see, we're going to have 1 way circulation off a high street.

1340
02:28:05,943 --> 02:28:06,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Milton something.

1341
02:28:06,684 --> 02:28:07,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1342
02:28:07,064 --> 02:28:07,464
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

1343
02:28:07,504 --> 02:28:08,826
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

1344
02:28:08,886 --> 02:28:14,711
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the, um, the proposed site plan, we're going to have one way circulation coming in off a high street.

1345
02:28:14,751 --> 02:28:20,916
[SPEAKER_10]: So as I previously said in the existing conditions plan, there's a 10 foot wide right away to the left side of the building.

1346
02:28:21,317 --> 02:28:24,920
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to serve as our one way access point into this project.

1347
02:28:25,741 --> 02:28:30,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, we go into the rear parking area where I talked about the 10 parking spaces.

1348
02:28:31,566 --> 02:28:32,327
[SPEAKER_10]: And as you can see.

1349
02:28:33,168 --> 02:28:39,833
[SPEAKER_10]: In that parking area, I expanded the existing drainage system, where it was previously just a crushed stone basin.

1350
02:28:40,454 --> 02:28:46,438
[SPEAKER_10]: We wanted to provide not only drainage mitigation for this project, but also enhance the landscaping.

1351
02:28:47,139 --> 02:28:50,882
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're proposing a bioretention cell to be placed.

1352
02:28:51,603 --> 02:28:57,207
[SPEAKER_10]: This bioretention cell, so we basically expanded the basin, almost doubled the size of it.

1353
02:28:58,363 --> 02:29:01,006
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to plant it so it'll be loam and seeded.

1354
02:29:01,846 --> 02:29:12,356
[SPEAKER_10]: And our landscape architect can talk more on it, but we are proposing landscape plantings that would do well in a bioretention cell.

1355
02:29:12,376 --> 02:29:16,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Another name for a bioretention cell is a rain garden, if people are more familiar with that.

1356
02:29:18,161 --> 02:29:25,187
[SPEAKER_10]: So what will happen is this parking lot will be able to sheet flow out to a crushed stone riprap area.

1357
02:29:26,092 --> 02:29:39,084
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll have pre-treatment, so if any sands that accumulated will be able to be collected in that pre-treatment forebay, and then the water will be able to then move out to the rain garden.

1358
02:29:41,178 --> 02:29:46,720
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be able to provide water to the plants and it's basically like a bathtub with plantings.

1359
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:49,301
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll be able to store water and we'll hold it.

1360
02:29:49,341 --> 02:29:52,162
[SPEAKER_10]: It will allow water to infiltrate back into the ground.

1361
02:29:52,182 --> 02:30:00,805
[SPEAKER_10]: And then in large storm events, like a 100 year storm event, we do provide, or if it goes over 100 years, we do have an emergency spillway.

1362
02:30:01,673 --> 02:30:10,455
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm tasked as an engineer to show pre-development versus post-development drainage patterns for a 210, 25, and 100-year storm event.

1363
02:30:10,995 --> 02:30:11,575
[SPEAKER_10]: I've done that.

1364
02:30:11,955 --> 02:30:14,716
[SPEAKER_10]: I provided a stormwater report to the city engineer.

1365
02:30:15,736 --> 02:30:16,536
[SPEAKER_10]: He did review it.

1366
02:30:16,796 --> 02:30:23,197
[SPEAKER_10]: There were some minor comments in his memo back to the design team, and I will be able to address those.

1367
02:30:24,358 --> 02:30:25,458
[SPEAKER_10]: With the overall design,

1368
02:30:26,177 --> 02:30:27,057
[SPEAKER_10]: He was okay with it.

1369
02:30:27,218 --> 02:30:29,999
[SPEAKER_10]: He just wanted some clarification on a few things.

1370
02:30:30,499 --> 02:30:34,381
[SPEAKER_10]: We think it's a good project with a conventional drainage system.

1371
02:30:35,482 --> 02:30:39,564
[SPEAKER_10]: You see big detention ponds or you see these underground chambers.

1372
02:30:39,984 --> 02:30:46,748
[SPEAKER_10]: We would have had to raise this site by about 18 to 24 inches to accommodate a conventional system.

1373
02:30:47,268 --> 02:30:54,952
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a low impact system and where we were trying to reduce impervious surfaces and provide additional landscaping.

1374
02:30:55,657 --> 02:30:59,380
[SPEAKER_10]: and still meet the stormwater policy, this seemed like the best method.

1375
02:31:00,841 --> 02:31:08,206
[SPEAKER_10]: But there was over 100 page report submitted as a stormwater report, and you can review the city engineer's comments on that.

1376
02:31:08,806 --> 02:31:12,089
[SPEAKER_10]: I just briefly want to speak on some of the utilities for this project.

1377
02:31:13,209 --> 02:31:16,912
[SPEAKER_10]: The existing funeral home was serviced by water and sewer services.

1378
02:31:17,733 --> 02:31:21,075
[SPEAKER_10]: We're proposing for the existing water service to be decommissioned.

1379
02:31:21,908 --> 02:31:34,439
[SPEAKER_10]: At the existing water main and high street, we're proposing a 2 inch domestic water line to serve as building in an independent 4 inch water line to serve as a fire protection for this building.

1380
02:31:35,860 --> 02:31:38,363
[SPEAKER_10]: The 4 inch water line could be subject to change.

1381
02:31:38,443 --> 02:31:44,328
[SPEAKER_10]: We did not complete any fire flow analysis that was noted by the city engineer, but we do intend.

1382
02:31:44,997 --> 02:31:55,766
[SPEAKER_10]: to run fire flow tests on the neighboring hydrants to see what the water pressure and we'll have a water engineer do the sizing on that water line.

1383
02:31:55,786 --> 02:32:03,072
[SPEAKER_10]: But I wanted to make the board aware that we do intend to provide fire protection to this with a sprinkler system.

1384
02:32:03,693 --> 02:32:05,615
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have talked to the fire chief about that.

1385
02:32:08,089 --> 02:32:11,712
[SPEAKER_10]: On the sewer service, we're looking to reutilize the existing sewer service.

1386
02:32:12,232 --> 02:32:22,901
[SPEAKER_10]: I provided calculations based on the number of bedrooms for the residential units in the anticipated flow from the commercial unit to the city engineer.

1387
02:32:23,001 --> 02:32:34,710
[SPEAKER_10]: He saw it as an insignificant increase, but he did ask us to video the sewer service, which is common practice to show that the sewer service is sound and intact.

1388
02:32:35,349 --> 02:32:36,590
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it can be reused.

1389
02:32:37,150 --> 02:32:42,693
[SPEAKER_10]: I already had that as a note on my plan, because as I said, that's a standard practice in engineering.

1390
02:32:43,533 --> 02:32:44,934
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's our intent.

1391
02:32:45,294 --> 02:32:55,759
[SPEAKER_10]: If for some reason we found the sewer service defective or structurally not intact, then we'd replace it in kind with a new PVC service.

1392
02:32:55,779 --> 02:33:00,762
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I covered most of the drainage.

1393
02:33:04,642 --> 02:33:08,803
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think at this time, I'll turn it over to our landscape architect.

1394
02:33:08,923 --> 02:33:11,604
[SPEAKER_10]: That will be page four of this presentation.

1395
02:33:12,084 --> 02:33:16,785
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when it comes to comments from the board, we can circle back to me if you have any comments.

1396
02:33:17,466 --> 02:33:17,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1397
02:33:19,546 --> 02:33:21,747
[SPEAKER_38]: Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board.

1398
02:33:21,767 --> 02:33:22,867
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm Natalie Adams.

1399
02:33:23,107 --> 02:33:23,847
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm with Verdant.

1400
02:33:24,308 --> 02:33:25,848
[SPEAKER_38]: We're out of Brookline, Massachusetts.

1401
02:33:26,568 --> 02:33:28,929
[SPEAKER_38]: Milton, if you can zoom into the plan.

1402
02:33:28,949 --> 02:33:32,930
[SPEAKER_38]: I'm going to start at the front entry, and I'm going to go counterclockwise around the building.

1403
02:33:34,131 --> 02:33:34,912
[SPEAKER_38]: So a little sidewalk.

1404
02:33:34,932 --> 02:33:40,896
[SPEAKER_38]: So we're proposing unit paving, which plays off the brick.

1405
02:33:41,016 --> 02:33:43,457
[SPEAKER_38]: And you'll see that when you see the elevations.

1406
02:33:44,718 --> 02:33:49,001
[SPEAKER_38]: And there's a brick walk that goes up the right side of the building to an entry.

1407
02:33:49,822 --> 02:33:57,647
[SPEAKER_38]: And that paving is defined so that vehicle traffic know that there is a pedestrian pathway here.

1408
02:33:58,107 --> 02:33:59,648
[SPEAKER_38]: And you'll see where you're noting an 18 feet 7 inches.

1409
02:34:02,312 --> 02:34:11,277
[SPEAKER_38]: from the building there to that line in the asphalt, and 13 feet 5 inches for the one-way traffic.

1410
02:34:11,898 --> 02:34:20,323
[SPEAKER_38]: And as we move up the page and to the back of the building, we're buffering the back of the building with Lakota Way.

1411
02:34:21,844 --> 02:34:23,385
[SPEAKER_38]: All the plants on this list are native.

1412
02:34:24,225 --> 02:34:28,188
[SPEAKER_38]: At Vernon, we plant 95% of the plants on our list are native.

1413
02:34:29,249 --> 02:34:33,152
[SPEAKER_38]: specific site, 100% of the plants are native, so we're very proud of that.

1414
02:34:33,893 --> 02:34:36,675
[SPEAKER_38]: Milton, if you can just zoom out a little so we can capture the whole parking lot.

1415
02:34:38,196 --> 02:34:46,182
[SPEAKER_38]: So now in the parking lot, you'll note the existing trees around the site, and they're those gray circles that don't have any color on them, they're off property.

1416
02:34:46,903 --> 02:34:54,369
[SPEAKER_38]: And so we tried to fit in some very... Some trees that will grow very large to

1417
02:34:56,528 --> 02:34:58,690
[SPEAKER_38]: to help with the environment.

1418
02:34:59,130 --> 02:35:02,293
[SPEAKER_38]: So all of these trees are, what are they, sycamore.

1419
02:35:03,214 --> 02:35:12,382
[SPEAKER_38]: And then in the back we have Aeschylus parviflora, which is a type of bottle brush buckeye, and that's another native.

1420
02:35:12,422 --> 02:35:13,543
[SPEAKER_38]: And they get quite large.

1421
02:35:13,603 --> 02:35:16,346
[SPEAKER_38]: Those circles don't really capture how large they get.

1422
02:35:16,606 --> 02:35:19,549
[SPEAKER_38]: And you'll note the biodetention or rain garden

1423
02:35:20,312 --> 02:35:22,213
[SPEAKER_38]: area that was spoke of earlier.

1424
02:35:22,674 --> 02:35:23,434
[SPEAKER_38]: This is seeded.

1425
02:35:23,914 --> 02:35:30,298
[SPEAKER_38]: Rain gardens have to be you have to be careful how you plant them because shrubs can't go in the low part of the rain garden where there's going to be standing water.

1426
02:35:30,719 --> 02:35:33,380
[SPEAKER_38]: So you always want to plant rushes and sedges.

1427
02:35:33,460 --> 02:35:34,761
[SPEAKER_38]: So that's what we've got in there.

1428
02:35:34,801 --> 02:35:48,310
[SPEAKER_38]: If you look at the plant list and they're going in in small plugs and growing up and you also know where we're planting milkweed, two different types of milkweed and a couple different rushes and a sage.

1429
02:35:48,390 --> 02:35:48,890
[SPEAKER_38]: So it's going to

1430
02:35:49,907 --> 02:35:51,208
[SPEAKER_38]: it's going to be a beautiful planting.

1431
02:35:51,989 --> 02:36:02,098
[SPEAKER_38]: And then you'll note we have another sycamore right down there by the bike racks to give that some shade, and another bottle brush buckeye by the bike racks as well.

1432
02:36:02,198 --> 02:36:02,899
[SPEAKER_38]: Thanks, Melton.

1433
02:36:03,320 --> 02:36:14,450
[SPEAKER_38]: And if you go down the page, we're just exiting the parking lot while we're going out the indoor, so to speak, but it's a 10-foot asphalt pavement.

1434
02:36:15,157 --> 02:36:20,718
[SPEAKER_38]: And we're also proposing a new street tree, and that's the Gliditsia tricanthus.

1435
02:36:20,758 --> 02:36:21,719
[SPEAKER_38]: That's a honey locust.

1436
02:36:21,799 --> 02:36:26,440
[SPEAKER_38]: They're very popular in any city in Massachusetts.

1437
02:36:26,480 --> 02:36:27,840
[SPEAKER_38]: They're also a native.

1438
02:36:28,300 --> 02:36:33,001
[SPEAKER_38]: And we have some short-term visitor bike racks right there.

1439
02:36:33,061 --> 02:36:36,282
[SPEAKER_38]: There's four racks, so they park eight bikes.

1440
02:36:38,424 --> 02:36:40,765
[SPEAKER_38]: And then you also see the dimensions of the sidewalk.

1441
02:36:40,805 --> 02:36:45,247
[SPEAKER_38]: So we're giving a nice wide sidewalk for the pedestrians in the area.

1442
02:36:45,647 --> 02:36:51,549
[SPEAKER_38]: 15 feet total on one side to the property line and 14, 11 on the left side.

1443
02:36:52,350 --> 02:36:58,252
[SPEAKER_38]: And the tree well is a really good size, 10 feet long by 4 feet, 8 inches wide.

1444
02:36:58,312 --> 02:36:59,913
[SPEAKER_38]: So that tree's got plenty of space.

1445
02:37:01,413 --> 02:37:02,514
[SPEAKER_38]: And that's my presentation.

1446
02:37:02,554 --> 02:37:02,874
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

1447
02:37:09,602 --> 02:37:16,244
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll move on to the facade of the building.

1448
02:37:17,264 --> 02:37:36,469
[SPEAKER_16]: We have here a typical tripartite scheme with the heavier visually materials along the bottom at the commercial storefront, and then a middle section with fiber cement, six-inch exposure, and a fiber cement panel.

1449
02:37:37,918 --> 02:37:46,983
[SPEAKER_16]: And then at the top, we have a more muted cap, which is, you'll see in the 3D where it recesses back.

1450
02:37:47,023 --> 02:37:50,285
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's meant to de-emphasize the top floor.

1451
02:37:55,928 --> 02:38:05,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Just to go briefly through the floor plans, there's one unit on the first floor, as well as roughly 1,000 square feet of commercial space toward the front.

1452
02:38:06,105 --> 02:38:09,749
[SPEAKER_16]: as well as the main lobby, vestibule, and trash collection.

1453
02:38:13,893 --> 02:38:15,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Then as you move up, there's four floors.

1454
02:38:15,655 --> 02:38:18,738
[SPEAKER_16]: There's four units on the next floor and the second floor.

1455
02:38:19,318 --> 02:38:21,701
[SPEAKER_16]: They also have the outdoor space for each unit.

1456
02:38:22,362 --> 02:38:24,904
[SPEAKER_16]: The third floor also has four units.

1457
02:38:25,104 --> 02:38:27,126
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the lower level of

1458
02:38:28,377 --> 02:38:34,678
[SPEAKER_16]: the four units, and then on the fourth floor is the upper level of the same units.

1459
02:38:35,558 --> 02:38:41,160
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can see here in plan, it's top level is set back, and the front and the rear facade.

1460
02:38:44,940 --> 02:38:52,822
[SPEAKER_16]: Talking about the roof plan a little bit, per the ordinance, we also have a solar ready area.

1461
02:38:54,242 --> 02:38:57,443
[SPEAKER_16]: If we subtract out the mechanical screen,

1462
02:38:58,792 --> 02:39:04,495
[SPEAKER_16]: area, which, you know, we have rooftop units for one, one of them for each unit and then the commercial space.

1463
02:39:05,435 --> 02:39:19,922
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we subtract the roof hatch area, we can still provide more than half which is required for solar ready zone.

1464
02:39:20,802 --> 02:39:27,025
[SPEAKER_16]: We normally like to include elevation along the street just for comparison.

1465
02:39:28,196 --> 02:39:28,716
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're interested.

1466
02:39:31,838 --> 02:39:37,480
[SPEAKER_16]: This gives you the idea of the lighting design that has been done.

1467
02:39:37,500 --> 02:39:45,604
[SPEAKER_16]: These all pass the ordinances, lighting ordinance, including the night sky provisions.

1468
02:39:47,205 --> 02:39:55,389
[SPEAKER_16]: We also have more detailed foot candle analysis, but that's probably a little bit too technical for right now, but we have the slide if you need to look at it.

1469
02:39:58,237 --> 02:39:59,177
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's a 3D view.

1470
02:39:59,337 --> 02:40:10,360
[SPEAKER_16]: This also indicates the facade and also the treatment of how we broke up the mass with these recesses, these decks in top level sets back as well.

1471
02:40:11,601 --> 02:40:26,465
[SPEAKER_16]: And this arcade also serves as a nice human scale gesture to the public as urban design likes to use and also

1472
02:40:27,880 --> 02:40:29,540
[SPEAKER_16]: pushed up to the sidewalk.

1473
02:40:31,521 --> 02:40:33,021
[SPEAKER_16]: We carry the same theme through.

1474
02:40:33,081 --> 02:40:44,805
[SPEAKER_16]: We also have the same, a similar relief in the facade that the text here, and you can see the same theme with a tripod thing wrapping around the building.

1475
02:40:48,506 --> 02:40:57,248
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a view that was requested of us from the neighbors, I believe, not the very next building in the corner, but the one after that.

1476
02:40:58,153 --> 02:41:02,696
[SPEAKER_16]: giving a sense of what the view would be like from their house.

1477
02:41:04,558 --> 02:41:13,204
[SPEAKER_16]: And this model actually does have the mechanical screen, it's just it's not visible from this angle.

1478
02:41:17,507 --> 02:41:24,112
[SPEAKER_16]: I think for the next portion, I can hand it off to Traffic Engineer.

1479
02:41:26,293 --> 02:41:27,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Dan, are you ready for that?

1480
02:41:28,088 --> 02:41:28,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I am.

1481
02:41:28,548 --> 02:41:30,189
[SPEAKER_09]: You can pull up my 1st slide.

1482
02:41:30,209 --> 02:41:31,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1483
02:41:36,132 --> 02:41:36,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening for the record.

1484
02:41:37,013 --> 02:41:38,013
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Daniel mills.

1485
02:41:38,033 --> 02:41:41,455
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a principal traffic engineer with transportation consultants.

1486
02:41:42,036 --> 02:41:47,699
[SPEAKER_09]: We conducted a traffic impact assessment for the proposed mix use development at 421 high street.

1487
02:41:49,862 --> 02:41:52,543
[SPEAKER_09]: The site is located on the north side of High Street.

1488
02:41:52,884 --> 02:41:59,788
[SPEAKER_09]: To the east is Brooks and Alston Street, and to the west is Canal and Warren Street.

1489
02:42:00,388 --> 02:42:05,772
[SPEAKER_09]: A little slightly further west is the West Medford MBTA commuter rail station.

1490
02:42:07,113 --> 02:42:17,820
[SPEAKER_09]: As part of our assessment, we reviewed the traffic volume on High Street, estimated the volume of site trips from the nine residential units and

1491
02:42:19,248 --> 02:42:20,910
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, commercial space.

1492
02:42:22,110 --> 02:42:26,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we also reviewed the circulation around the, um, the building itself.

1493
02:42:27,715 --> 02:42:36,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and we reviewed the, uh, site for the fixed bus route services, the MBTA, um, and other transit opportunities.

1494
02:42:37,402 --> 02:42:38,463
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, next slide, please.

1495
02:42:42,467 --> 02:42:44,808
[SPEAKER_09]: So, with regards, you can zoom in a little bit on this Milton.

1496
02:42:45,148 --> 02:42:49,369
[SPEAKER_09]: So, with regards to the transit opportunities, this is a transit oriented development.

1497
02:42:50,169 --> 02:42:55,951
[SPEAKER_09]: It does qualify for the high frequency transit under the zoning relative to the parking requirements.

1498
02:42:57,471 --> 02:43:03,213
[SPEAKER_09]: As you can see in these, the dotted line circle around the site is a quarter mile radius.

1499
02:43:04,230 --> 02:43:13,677
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has access to the MBTA bus routes 80, 94, and 95, shown in the lines there on the roadways.

1500
02:43:15,158 --> 02:43:20,521
[SPEAKER_09]: The yellow lines are sidewalk connections throughout the city, leading to these transit opportunities.

1501
02:43:21,402 --> 02:43:26,646
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, that qualifies for the high frequency transit under zoning.

1502
02:43:27,986 --> 02:43:28,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Next slide, please.

1503
02:43:35,624 --> 02:43:42,375
[SPEAKER_09]: And 1 of the critical aspects is to identify the amount of traffic that would be generated from a proposed use.

1504
02:43:43,176 --> 02:43:45,961
[SPEAKER_09]: We relied on the Institute of transportation engineers.

1505
02:43:46,733 --> 02:43:57,515
[SPEAKER_09]: chip generation manual to identify or estimate the amount of traffic that will be generated by nine residential units in the thousand square feet of commercial space.

1506
02:43:57,535 --> 02:44:04,576
[SPEAKER_09]: As industry practice, we looked at the morning peak hour of a weekday, the critical time period when commuter traffic is on the road.

1507
02:44:05,116 --> 02:44:11,638
[SPEAKER_09]: And if a project was to have major impact, it would be during this time when the volume is highest on the road.

1508
02:44:13,669 --> 02:44:18,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Similarly, we looked at the weekday evening peak hour when volumes on the roadway are generally its highest during the day.

1509
02:44:20,511 --> 02:44:34,755
[SPEAKER_09]: With the residential units being a multi-family type of situation, the truck generation is estimated to be approximately three vehicles total entering and exiting.

1510
02:44:34,875 --> 02:44:38,856
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a very low generating use being a residential

1511
02:44:39,820 --> 02:44:46,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, complex, especially being close to transit oriented oriented services.

1512
02:44:47,855 --> 02:44:53,018
[SPEAKER_09]: With regards to the retail use, again, it's built into the site.

1513
02:44:54,479 --> 02:45:10,247
[SPEAKER_09]: For this particular analysis, we looked at a variety store, applied the industry standard trip rates to the 1,000 square feet, and we estimated about three vehicles during the morning peak hour and slightly higher in the evening peak hour.

1514
02:45:10,927 --> 02:45:23,050
[SPEAKER_09]: So, in total, we have about a total trip expected from the development during the weekday morning peak hour of six trips entering and exiting, and in the evening, about 11 trips entering and exiting.

1515
02:45:23,850 --> 02:45:28,491
[SPEAKER_09]: On a daily basis, we could see 110 vehicle total.

1516
02:45:28,651 --> 02:45:36,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's overestimated based on the data that we have to work with, but that's the analysis we're presenting.

1517
02:45:36,837 --> 02:45:41,579
[SPEAKER_09]: In comparison to the funeral home, we believe that this is a much less intense use.

1518
02:45:41,659 --> 02:45:50,161
[SPEAKER_09]: The funeral home, depending on the services held at the site, would have had a lot more traffic in and out of the property.

1519
02:45:51,582 --> 02:45:53,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Milton, can you bring up a site plan?

1520
02:45:56,863 --> 02:45:59,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe slide two or three?

1521
02:45:59,664 --> 02:45:59,864
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1522
02:46:01,345 --> 02:46:02,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll have you bring back to that.

1523
02:46:07,135 --> 02:46:10,477
[SPEAKER_09]: That one works, sure.

1524
02:46:11,197 --> 02:46:20,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Presently, there's a 10-foot right-of-way that provides access to the site, provided to the funeral home, right to the back parking lot, and to the adjacent property.

1525
02:46:20,982 --> 02:46:29,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Our proposal is to have the residents use that as a one-way entering to access the back parking lot.

1526
02:46:30,247 --> 02:46:40,310
[SPEAKER_09]: and then use a clockwise direction around the back of the building, which connection does not exist today, to the other easement and use it as an exiting movement.

1527
02:46:41,931 --> 02:46:58,436
[SPEAKER_09]: We just feel this is better site circulation, uses the easements that are available to the property, and the exit provides a bit better site distance from that point compared to the shared easement on the east side of the site.

1528
02:46:59,004 --> 02:47:09,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so we're proposing, um, signage, um, and whatnot to direct the residents out of the rear parking lot around, um, in a clockwise direction about back onto high street.

1529
02:47:10,836 --> 02:47:16,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, we felt this is an improved over the current situation with a single access, um.

1530
02:47:17,962 --> 02:47:18,523
[SPEAKER_09]: situation.

1531
02:47:19,563 --> 02:47:23,946
[SPEAKER_09]: We did have a discussion with the fire chief.

1532
02:47:24,446 --> 02:47:33,732
[SPEAKER_09]: He found the access points acceptable for fire access.

1533
02:47:34,232 --> 02:47:36,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Milton, I have you jump to that last slide.

1534
02:47:36,453 --> 02:47:38,334
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be 19.

1535
02:47:40,448 --> 02:47:53,245
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, 1 of the comments from the, uh, city traffic engineer was, even though this is a, uh, a low, uh, trip generation, a low volume, um, site, um, there are.

1536
02:47:54,030 --> 02:48:07,496
[SPEAKER_09]: could be some increased volume on the roadways and one of his requests was these in-street, if you go to actually the last page, the next page, was to request these in-street pedestrian signs.

1537
02:48:08,937 --> 02:48:17,321
[SPEAKER_09]: The request was to furnish two for to be placed at Canal and Warren Street crossings and so our proponent is committing to do that.

1538
02:48:20,002 --> 02:48:20,822
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my presentation.

1539
02:48:20,862 --> 02:48:22,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll turn it back to Attorney Desmond and we can

1540
02:48:23,440 --> 02:48:30,366
[SPEAKER_20]: Probably answer some questions.

1541
02:48:30,426 --> 02:48:34,769
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, a couple of things to point out as well.

1542
02:48:35,550 --> 02:48:49,021
[SPEAKER_20]: In our conversations with the fire chief, you'll note, and if you could go to the landscape slide, Milton, we called out the sidewalk.

1543
02:48:50,517 --> 02:48:54,280
[SPEAKER_20]: by pavers as opposed to the asphalt.

1544
02:48:54,660 --> 02:49:05,907
[SPEAKER_20]: And we kept that flush with the drive so that emergency access would have the full length of the easement area in the event that they needed to access the back of the building.

1545
02:49:07,188 --> 02:49:11,013
[SPEAKER_20]: What we're proposing to do here and we've changed the original plans.

1546
02:49:11,473 --> 02:49:19,763
[SPEAKER_20]: There were going to be further changes so I didn't submit the changes that we made to the set of plans tonight but we're proposing planters at the front of the building.

1547
02:49:20,304 --> 02:49:22,126
[SPEAKER_20]: Originally there was some landscaping here but

1548
02:49:22,706 --> 02:49:29,068
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, in conversations with the fire chief, it was thought that that would get in the way of his access to the rear of the building.

1549
02:49:29,148 --> 02:49:42,191
[SPEAKER_20]: So the compromise was to make the sidewalk flush and call it out with pavers and also to add some landscaping by way of planters in the front that he could if he needed to roll over.

1550
02:49:42,211 --> 02:49:48,853
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think also it's significant to note at this point that this is currently two-way traffic.

1551
02:49:49,333 --> 02:49:57,629
[SPEAKER_20]: It was two-way traffic for both the funeral home and also for the adjacent building, 425 High Street, 425-27.

1552
02:50:01,228 --> 02:50:07,692
[SPEAKER_20]: We're now going to limit that to one way for our residents, which should lessen the impact overall on that right of way.

1553
02:50:08,213 --> 02:50:14,237
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's anticipated that in the morning, traffic from the 425 will be coming out this way.

1554
02:50:14,297 --> 02:50:18,419
[SPEAKER_20]: But if traffic is exiting our building, it will take the

1555
02:50:19,600 --> 02:50:25,582
[SPEAKER_20]: I always do this left turn and head out the easement on the other side of the building.

1556
02:50:26,562 --> 02:50:30,403
[SPEAKER_20]: So we expect that much of the traffic will be in the same direction when it occurs.

1557
02:50:31,524 --> 02:50:42,087
[SPEAKER_20]: But as Dan mentioned, the amount of traffic coming in and out is negligible because all you're going to have in the back here at this point is residential parking.

1558
02:50:43,088 --> 02:50:53,696
[SPEAKER_20]: In speaking with community development as well, I know that Danielle Evans had asked whether or not we would be willing to put two electric meter spaces in front.

1559
02:50:53,957 --> 02:50:58,701
[SPEAKER_20]: Apparently, there's two spaces in front that were unmetered due to the prior use as a funeral home.

1560
02:50:59,281 --> 02:51:06,967
[SPEAKER_20]: And certainly, we have no issue with inserting electric meters in the front of those two spaces which exist.

1561
02:51:07,728 --> 02:51:10,469
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just wanted to point that out to the board.

1562
02:51:12,190 --> 02:51:15,232
[SPEAKER_20]: And we did make the changes with regard to the electric charging station.

1563
02:51:15,272 --> 02:51:23,436
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure why, but this is the second meeting where it's been called out, but on the plans it showed is the electric charging ballers.

1564
02:51:23,496 --> 02:51:26,558
[SPEAKER_20]: So we've had that on the plan from the outset.

1565
02:51:27,038 --> 02:51:32,561
[SPEAKER_20]: But with respect to the changes that we could make from the traffic engineering report, on the plan this evening, we did.

1566
02:51:33,021 --> 02:51:36,302
[SPEAKER_20]: The handicapped space is now with the

1567
02:51:37,803 --> 02:51:45,513
[SPEAKER_20]: The VN accessibility on the right hand side, and it's a back end space as requested from the engineer.

1568
02:51:47,736 --> 02:51:53,644
[SPEAKER_20]: So, with that, I will turn it over with questions, but I just wanted to provide you with that additional information.

1569
02:51:56,565 --> 02:51:58,626
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you so much, Attorney Desmond.

1570
02:51:58,646 --> 02:52:00,568
[SPEAKER_30]: There's one point of clarification.

1571
02:52:00,768 --> 02:52:05,151
[SPEAKER_30]: The right of way, if I'm not mistaken, on the presentation said it was 10 feet.

1572
02:52:05,591 --> 02:52:11,855
[SPEAKER_30]: However, if you're going to reduce it to one way, the requirements for the city is 12 feet for one way.

1573
02:52:13,052 --> 02:52:16,454
[SPEAKER_20]: The actual driveway that's used is 12 feet.

1574
02:52:16,594 --> 02:52:21,636
[SPEAKER_20]: The right-of-way is 10, and there's actually almost two feet here.

1575
02:52:21,736 --> 02:52:24,658
[SPEAKER_20]: So that is accessible, and it's pre-existing.

1576
02:52:25,278 --> 02:52:31,902
[SPEAKER_20]: At this point, it's been used for two-way traffic, and we were not cited for it.

1577
02:52:33,342 --> 02:52:45,317
[SPEAKER_20]: With respect to the zoning relief that we saw, maybe because we have the other exit as well, but it is more than 10 feet, the actual paved area that's used.

1578
02:52:46,178 --> 02:52:47,900
[SPEAKER_20]: The land court right of way is 10 feet.

1579
02:52:50,420 --> 02:53:05,425
[SPEAKER_30]: And I have a few other questions in regards to day use and what your relief was, but I think probably this is where I'll just leave it for the comments from city staff, especially, specifically Danielle Evans, if she can speak more directly on.

1580
02:53:06,725 --> 02:53:09,406
[SPEAKER_30]: She'll probably be able to clarify for me.

1581
02:53:12,707 --> 02:53:13,747
[SPEAKER_32]: Danielle.

1582
02:53:14,407 --> 02:53:15,348
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1583
02:53:16,388 --> 02:53:18,849
[SPEAKER_32]: I did have a question.

1584
02:53:21,275 --> 02:53:28,138
[SPEAKER_32]: for the traffic consultant when I was rereading the study tonight and then listening to the presentation.

1585
02:53:29,019 --> 02:53:37,763
[SPEAKER_32]: So the trip counts for the ground floor retail, that's trips to the site, not trips through the access drives, correct?

1586
02:53:37,783 --> 02:53:41,505
[SPEAKER_32]: Because there's not going to be the commercial space in the back.

1587
02:53:43,041 --> 02:53:43,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1588
02:53:43,762 --> 02:53:47,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are trips, you know, taking into account that they'll be on street, likely to be on street parking.

1589
02:53:49,545 --> 02:53:50,785
[SPEAKER_09]: Those trips are coming to the site.

1590
02:53:50,805 --> 02:53:54,347
[SPEAKER_09]: They will not, there's no signage, you know, indicating parking at the rear of the site.

1591
02:53:54,908 --> 02:54:00,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And because of the, you know, the location of it, it's not being really visible from the street.

1592
02:54:00,591 --> 02:54:05,694
[SPEAKER_09]: So the expectation is that anyone coming to the site, we count them as a trip for analysis purposes.

1593
02:54:05,814 --> 02:54:11,677
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually, you know, load them together in one single driveway during our analysis as a conservative measure.

1594
02:54:12,177 --> 02:54:15,120
[SPEAKER_09]: But in actuality, it will be street parking.

1595
02:54:16,121 --> 02:54:27,233
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, so none of those turning movements for the trips generated for the retail use are moving back up.

1596
02:54:27,733 --> 02:54:31,938
[SPEAKER_32]: In your report, the turning movements, the in and out, is just for the residential?

1597
02:54:33,576 --> 02:54:34,716
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're total.

1598
02:54:35,577 --> 02:54:36,537
[SPEAKER_09]: The figures are total.

1599
02:54:38,017 --> 02:54:39,337
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't mean to misrepresent it.

1600
02:54:39,377 --> 02:54:47,339
[SPEAKER_09]: We're being conservative and just loading all the sites that are generated by the uses in a single point.

1601
02:54:48,640 --> 02:54:52,380
[SPEAKER_09]: In actuality, they won't be generated in a single point.

1602
02:54:52,460 --> 02:54:56,201
[SPEAKER_09]: The commercial trips won't be on the site.

1603
02:54:56,261 --> 02:55:00,062
[SPEAKER_09]: They won't be turning into or out of the site from a driveway perspective.

1604
02:55:01,483 --> 02:55:02,483
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, because I think that's what...

1605
02:55:04,013 --> 02:55:19,883
[SPEAKER_32]: we're trying to get comfortable with is the two-way access drive use of how many times that a car coming out might be coming in at the same time that a car's coming in.

1606
02:55:20,784 --> 02:55:31,131
[SPEAKER_32]: And how would you mitigate that if there could be like sensors or some kind of vehicle detection, like light or something like that?

1607
02:55:32,056 --> 02:55:42,045
[SPEAKER_32]: But it seems like the turning movements into the site and out are not as high as what's in the report, because that's accounting for retail trips, correct?

1608
02:55:42,085 --> 02:55:42,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1609
02:55:42,405 --> 02:55:48,591
[SPEAKER_09]: So the table six that was presented on one of the slides, I think it was slide 17, 18.

1610
02:55:53,936 --> 02:55:58,640
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we just look at the residential column, it's basically one entering trip.

1611
02:55:59,402 --> 02:56:03,026
[SPEAKER_09]: In the morning, and then would be using that shared driveway.

1612
02:56:03,066 --> 02:56:07,390
[SPEAKER_09]: The exiting the 2 exiting trips would be using the 1 way on the East side of the building.

1613
02:56:07,850 --> 02:56:08,390
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're looking at.

1614
02:56:09,752 --> 02:56:13,675
[SPEAKER_09]: 1, 1 vehicle will be entering during the morning and that's that's typical of a residential use.

1615
02:56:13,715 --> 02:56:15,637
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're going to work, you're leaving the site.

1616
02:56:16,638 --> 02:56:20,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, the majority of residential traffic will be leaving the property in a morning peak hour.

1617
02:56:21,542 --> 02:56:24,324
[SPEAKER_09]: In the evening peak hour, we would see more returning trips.

1618
02:56:25,505 --> 02:56:36,393
[SPEAKER_09]: In this case, we're estimating two entering trips from the residential portion of the project would be entering between one hour in the evening.

1619
02:56:36,413 --> 02:56:43,659
[SPEAKER_09]: There's really a very low volume, very low usage of that easement to enter the property.

1620
02:56:48,650 --> 02:56:54,799
[SPEAKER_09]: The exiting traffic that you see there in the residential category would be using the exit driveway to the east of the site.

1621
02:56:55,199 --> 02:57:02,229
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the retail, again, the volumes that you see in that column on the retail, those would be really street parking.

1622
02:57:02,369 --> 02:57:04,913
[SPEAKER_09]: They wouldn't be exiting from the site or entering the site.

1623
02:57:09,043 --> 02:57:23,668
[SPEAKER_20]: And also, I think it's important to point out that with respect to the site as it existed prior to the proposed development, there was no 15 foot right of way within the rear of the building.

1624
02:57:24,328 --> 02:57:27,009
[SPEAKER_20]: The funeral home extended to the entire property line.

1625
02:57:27,669 --> 02:57:33,757
[SPEAKER_20]: The only access to that back parking lot from the site was that right-of-way.

1626
02:57:36,700 --> 02:57:40,906
[SPEAKER_20]: Historically, there was also a single-family residence in the back here.

1627
02:57:41,606 --> 02:57:46,673
[SPEAKER_20]: We're significantly reducing the amount of traffic that's going to use that right-of-way.

1628
02:57:47,133 --> 02:58:00,460
[SPEAKER_20]: We're reducing it from two-way, which is what it was for both the funeral home commercial use, the apartment on the second floor, which was there, the house, which was located in the back, to one-way for overnight residential use.

1629
02:58:01,321 --> 02:58:07,284
[SPEAKER_20]: Traffic entering in the morning will utilize this right-of-way.

1630
02:58:07,764 --> 02:58:12,407
[SPEAKER_20]: And there's the ability, which was not, to utilize this space to make that occur.

1631
02:58:13,663 --> 02:58:23,185
[SPEAKER_20]: So the amount of traffic that's going to traverse the existing right-of-way is substantially reduced from what was the prior use of two-way traffic.

1632
02:58:30,926 --> 02:58:38,628
[SPEAKER_32]: So is there any data on existing counts of who's going in and out of that right-of-way?

1633
02:58:42,137 --> 02:58:44,378
[SPEAKER_32]: or 425, is it just the glass company then?

1634
02:58:47,779 --> 02:58:50,419
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll let Dan speak.

1635
02:58:50,439 --> 02:58:53,760
[SPEAKER_20]: He did review the video that they had on file.

1636
02:58:56,081 --> 02:59:01,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get the message here.

1637
02:59:01,922 --> 02:59:07,184
[SPEAKER_09]: We did collect some data for the existing driveway during the morning peak hour.

1638
02:59:07,204 --> 02:59:11,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to try to grab that information really quick here.

1639
02:59:16,719 --> 02:59:17,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Should I stop sharing?

1640
02:59:18,820 --> 02:59:27,464
[SPEAKER_09]: You can keep that up.

1641
02:59:27,685 --> 02:59:27,985
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1642
02:59:28,285 --> 02:59:39,570
[SPEAKER_09]: So the majority are the vehicles from the glass company, the vans, the pickup trucks.

1643
02:59:42,412 --> 02:59:44,253
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on the order of magnitude of six vehicles.

1644
02:59:45,457 --> 02:59:48,658
[SPEAKER_09]: coming in and out during the morning and evening peak hour.

1645
02:59:51,198 --> 02:59:55,919
[SPEAKER_32]: And that will likely reduce because they won't be parking in that back driveway anymore, correct?

1646
02:59:56,439 --> 02:59:56,819
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1647
02:59:57,019 --> 02:59:59,360
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

1648
03:00:00,160 --> 03:00:12,062
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so again, there were six vehicles exiting in the morning, and that's when those vehicles exit to go to a job site, our vehicles for the residential portion are not entering the site.

1649
03:00:12,712 --> 03:00:15,633
[SPEAKER_09]: because of the characteristic of the residential use there, they're exiting the site.

1650
03:00:15,933 --> 03:00:17,634
[SPEAKER_09]: They would be using the other driveway.

1651
03:00:18,774 --> 03:00:27,037
[SPEAKER_09]: In the evening, during evening peak hour, we observed three vehicles exiting the abutting property on that shared driveway.

1652
03:00:27,057 --> 03:00:33,379
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking three exiting vehicles versus two entering vehicles over the course of an hour.

1653
03:00:35,220 --> 03:00:40,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of the low volumes of both those, there's low probability that they're actually going to be sharing the same space at the same time.

1654
03:00:44,378 --> 03:00:48,900
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay, thank you, and sorry that these questions are coming at the meeting.

1655
03:00:51,281 --> 03:00:55,462
[SPEAKER_32]: It wasn't until last week that I realized that that use was still going to be going out.

1656
03:00:55,822 --> 03:00:59,064
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't realize that there was still a parking situation back there.

1657
03:00:59,624 --> 03:01:01,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to provide the clarification.

1658
03:01:02,045 --> 03:01:02,365
[SPEAKER_32]: Okay.

1659
03:01:05,346 --> 03:01:07,607
[SPEAKER_32]: And did you have any questions, Madam Chair?

1660
03:01:08,899 --> 03:01:21,869
[SPEAKER_30]: My biggest question was on vehicle conflict, and I think it's pretty much been hashed out, but I'm still not sure that the city is satisfied with the response as far as.

1661
03:01:24,475 --> 03:01:25,356
[SPEAKER_30]: as it's been presented.

1662
03:01:25,996 --> 03:01:36,164
[SPEAKER_20]: If I could further clarify with respect to the easement, part of the difficulty is that this easement was, we're not the granting party in this easement.

1663
03:01:36,304 --> 03:01:47,233
[SPEAKER_20]: So in order to provide building 25 with access to this particular easement, we would have to obtain the petition,

1664
03:01:49,154 --> 03:01:58,921
[SPEAKER_20]: the grant from the abut it because otherwise we'd be overburdening the easement and overextending our easement because it's only specific to the property.

1665
03:01:59,001 --> 03:02:02,724
[SPEAKER_20]: Any easement is only specific to the property that it's granted to.

1666
03:02:03,564 --> 03:02:05,926
[SPEAKER_20]: So we would need to get their consent to that.

1667
03:02:05,946 --> 03:02:12,711
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, from a practical aspect, I don't know why anyone would want to do that given then you're going to have

1668
03:02:13,131 --> 03:02:18,517
[SPEAKER_20]: six commercial vehicles trucking through the back and then out through that easement next to your property.

1669
03:02:19,358 --> 03:02:26,907
[SPEAKER_20]: In addition to that, not only would the owner have to agree to the grant of that easement, but you would also have to have buy-in from the lender.

1670
03:02:26,947 --> 03:02:30,210
[SPEAKER_20]: So they would have to subrogate whatever mortgage they had.

1671
03:02:30,791 --> 03:02:41,576
[SPEAKER_20]: to the easement rights and in addition to that you would then have commercial traffic traversing through the residential, essentially a residential development.

1672
03:02:42,297 --> 03:02:48,440
[SPEAKER_20]: You know pedestrians going to park here residents and then they're going to have to walk across this and then they're going to have to be concerned about

1673
03:02:49,060 --> 03:02:54,881
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, commercial vehicles exiting, you know, taking the turn and exiting along that pathway.

1674
03:02:55,541 --> 03:03:00,942
[SPEAKER_20]: It just creates a lot more traffic that is unanticipated from the project.

1675
03:03:01,462 --> 03:03:17,025
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, there have been, we've had meetings with the neighbors about this project, and quite honestly, they were thrilled that we would be moving forward and that the glass company would not be utilizing the back in the morning to, you know, to get their trucks ready.

1676
03:03:18,445 --> 03:03:26,293
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been difficult for my client, and I know the owner previously, to try to address that specifically with the owner at this time, given the fact that the project's pending.

1677
03:03:27,534 --> 03:03:34,560
[SPEAKER_20]: But I know that, you know, to have the commercial vehicles now moving through a residential property, we would have to grant an easement.

1678
03:03:34,580 --> 03:03:39,485
[SPEAKER_20]: They would have to, you know, would be permitted to traverse the back of the parking lot.

1679
03:03:39,665 --> 03:03:41,447
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, in addition, we would have to get

1680
03:03:41,947 --> 03:03:52,615
[SPEAKER_20]: the permission of not only the owner of building 417, but also the lender in that instance.

1681
03:03:53,596 --> 03:03:58,359
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, we'd be policing speed through that back area of our property.

1682
03:03:59,400 --> 03:04:05,424
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been a headache, I know, both for the city and for the prior owners.

1683
03:04:06,645 --> 03:04:07,726
[SPEAKER_20]: And this project, 425, I provided

1684
03:04:09,767 --> 03:04:12,008
[SPEAKER_20]: city staff with the zoning decisions on that.

1685
03:04:12,748 --> 03:04:20,209
[SPEAKER_20]: This was a situation back in the 1980s where there had been a fire and that they went ahead and built the building higher and without permission.

1686
03:04:21,850 --> 03:04:26,671
[SPEAKER_20]: At that point, it was built and I'm sure that there was some sense that they had to deal with what was there.

1687
03:04:26,751 --> 03:04:33,152
[SPEAKER_20]: But this reduces the number of vehicles that are using that one way.

1688
03:04:33,172 --> 03:04:35,993
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you can also see and I'm not sure,

1689
03:04:36,633 --> 03:04:39,455
[SPEAKER_20]: of what significance this is, but if I can share my screen.

1690
03:04:42,777 --> 03:04:44,118
[SPEAKER_20]: Can you see this, folks, or no?

1691
03:04:44,978 --> 03:04:45,619
[SPEAKER_20]: Not yet.

1692
03:04:46,879 --> 03:04:48,040
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sharing, that's why.

1693
03:04:48,060 --> 03:04:48,941
[SPEAKER_20]: Hold on one second.

1694
03:04:50,341 --> 03:04:51,362
[SPEAKER_20]: Now I've lapsed out of it.

1695
03:04:51,382 --> 03:04:58,786
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me see if I can.

1696
03:05:01,048 --> 03:05:02,469
[SPEAKER_20]: On the other side of the property,

1697
03:05:03,911 --> 03:05:06,957
[SPEAKER_20]: There is also a passageway which I supplied.

1698
03:05:12,783 --> 03:05:15,205
[SPEAKER_20]: For some reason, I think I just lost my slide set.

1699
03:05:17,848 --> 03:05:23,813
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so there's a passageway over here as well, which went out to Warren Street.

1700
03:05:24,293 --> 03:05:26,915
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, this is the only one that's used.

1701
03:05:26,955 --> 03:05:30,959
[SPEAKER_20]: This is actually blocked off with a stockade fence, and there's no curb cut.

1702
03:05:31,900 --> 03:05:34,322
[SPEAKER_20]: But, you know, from the perspective of access,

1703
03:05:35,653 --> 03:05:41,556
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, we're reducing the access on the right of way, providing our residents with access on the other side.

1704
03:05:41,916 --> 03:05:46,659
[SPEAKER_20]: And there is, you know, possibly an alternative for access out on this side.

1705
03:05:47,679 --> 03:05:51,001
[SPEAKER_20]: We haven't had conversations with engineering or with traffic as of yet.

1706
03:05:51,642 --> 03:05:55,944
[SPEAKER_20]: We received the comments last week, but, you know, I suggest that

1707
03:05:59,008 --> 03:06:12,178
[SPEAKER_20]: To grant an easement, number one, would disrupt the project, but the availability of being able to get the owner of 417 to agree to something of that nature and also get his lender to agree with it is a very heavy lift.

1708
03:06:16,101 --> 03:06:16,602
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you, Ms.

1709
03:06:16,662 --> 03:06:17,062
[SPEAKER_30]: Desmond.

1710
03:06:17,162 --> 03:06:17,622
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia?

1711
03:06:19,384 --> 03:06:20,505
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1712
03:06:21,746 --> 03:06:23,467
[SPEAKER_21]: So I did just want to weigh in that we

1713
03:06:25,067 --> 03:06:42,922
[SPEAKER_21]: have been consulting in the background with some of the other city staff about this because of the concerns about the the two-way use by the abutter at 425 high street and so i just will clarify that we did speak to the building commissioner and he said that this as is was

1714
03:06:44,523 --> 03:06:56,529
[SPEAKER_21]: because it's a previously non-conforming use as a two-way, that he allowed it for zoning purposes, and we noted that the fire chief was okay with this.

1715
03:06:56,949 --> 03:07:01,232
[SPEAKER_21]: The big concerns has been, frankly, with just conflict of people using the site.

1716
03:07:01,272 --> 03:07:03,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Would that result in queuing on High Street?

1717
03:07:04,213 --> 03:07:05,754
[SPEAKER_21]: and then like a safety issue.

1718
03:07:06,334 --> 03:07:14,836
[SPEAKER_21]: And so there is a question that sort of has come out from the staff about technology that could be deployed at the site to mitigate conflict.

1719
03:07:15,136 --> 03:07:30,040
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we do actually understand that we wouldn't actually want the glass trucks going behind the other building and around, that would actually cause them to be going where you would reasonably expect the residents to be walking or spending time.

1720
03:07:31,132 --> 03:07:37,094
[SPEAKER_21]: So it's not irrational, this layout, but what could we do around technology?

1721
03:07:37,194 --> 03:07:41,775
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if you're a traffic consultant or anybody would have a specific recommendation.

1722
03:07:42,075 --> 03:07:51,558
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, there's a building in Medford Square that just added like a beeping sound so that when a vehicle is entering like the one

1723
03:07:52,138 --> 03:07:54,901
[SPEAKER_21]: It's one here, it's brand new, just finished construction.

1724
03:07:55,782 --> 03:08:07,596
[SPEAKER_21]: There's only one way in and out of that driveway and there is a beep that alerts people on the pedestrians that somebody is coming out of that driveway.

1725
03:08:07,616 --> 03:08:09,358
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that 3036 Salem Street, Alicia?

1726
03:08:12,863 --> 03:08:19,848
[SPEAKER_21]: Amanda, I'm thinking about the one I just signed the occupancy permit for, the three stories above the old theater building.

1727
03:08:20,329 --> 03:08:21,990
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that's it.

1728
03:08:22,010 --> 03:08:22,891
[SPEAKER_21]: That's 3036, yeah, that one.

1729
03:08:23,731 --> 03:08:26,053
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's a 10-foot right-of-way with two-way traffic.

1730
03:08:26,674 --> 03:08:27,895
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't remember the width of it.

1731
03:08:27,915 --> 03:08:30,056
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that your case?

1732
03:08:30,957 --> 03:08:31,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1733
03:08:35,458 --> 03:08:38,459
[SPEAKER_21]: So actually, that that's in use, right?

1734
03:08:39,639 --> 03:08:41,279
[SPEAKER_21]: It's in fact, it is in use there.

1735
03:08:41,319 --> 03:08:43,620
[SPEAKER_21]: There are occupants in that building already.

1736
03:08:45,120 --> 03:08:48,081
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think that this isn't an insurmountable problem.

1737
03:08:48,761 --> 03:08:55,383
[SPEAKER_21]: But we would want to have a discussion about some sort of technology from the city staff perspective to

1738
03:08:56,323 --> 03:08:58,544
[SPEAKER_21]: to make it a safe situation.

1739
03:08:58,564 --> 03:09:10,752
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that, in my opinion, from what we've seen, there's not going to be so much use that we're going to have queuing on High Street that's going to get out of control, not according to your traffic study.

1740
03:09:11,633 --> 03:09:13,414
[SPEAKER_21]: That's part of our concern.

1741
03:09:17,891 --> 03:09:21,453
[SPEAKER_20]: We're certainly open to that discussions for alternatives.

1742
03:09:22,493 --> 03:09:27,035
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just that the easement would be very difficult to pursue.

1743
03:09:27,075 --> 03:09:32,198
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's land court, so you'd be tied up in land court for two years trying to get a plan approved.

1744
03:09:32,960 --> 03:09:36,281
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we actually discussed this with the city engineer as well.

1745
03:09:37,201 --> 03:09:51,086
[SPEAKER_21]: Kathy, since this meeting has been ongoing, actually since this section of this meeting, I forwarded you an email that is research from our, one of our interns who did a full deed search on the history of the properties and easements.

1746
03:09:51,186 --> 03:09:53,687
[SPEAKER_21]: It was fascinating, laid it out clearly for me.

1747
03:09:54,147 --> 03:09:57,068
[SPEAKER_21]: So I was able to review this and it's,

1748
03:09:58,408 --> 03:10:14,174
[SPEAKER_21]: from a practical sense like there's the historical sense is what she just dug up but from a practical sense the idea of the easement and having those trucks coming around just doesn't feel right either and we obviously can't cut them off from not being able to to exit.

1749
03:10:14,534 --> 03:10:21,277
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd hate to see a good project with nine units of housing and commercial on the first floor not happen because of

1750
03:10:22,237 --> 03:10:27,318
[SPEAKER_21]: We couldn't figure out how a couple of trucks were going to get in and out of the back lot.

1751
03:10:28,378 --> 03:10:30,279
[SPEAKER_21]: We certainly have no objection to that.

1752
03:10:34,600 --> 03:10:35,040
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1753
03:10:35,100 --> 03:10:39,541
[SPEAKER_30]: Are there any other questions from the city staff?

1754
03:10:45,282 --> 03:10:47,243
[SPEAKER_30]: How about clarifying questions from the board?

1755
03:10:52,318 --> 03:11:07,311
[SPEAKER_27]: No, except to appreciate adopting the bike racks, both in the front for commercial use and in the back for residential use.

1756
03:11:08,692 --> 03:11:18,700
[SPEAKER_27]: Working as a traffic engineer myself, I recently had a project where we had a hard time convincing the client we were working for to separate the bike parking.

1757
03:11:19,221 --> 03:11:20,562
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was nice to see that.

1758
03:11:23,532 --> 03:11:34,059
[SPEAKER_27]: And I do think that, as well, that the usage of the two-way right-of-way for the few trucks is not an insurmountable problem.

1759
03:11:34,159 --> 03:11:40,523
[SPEAKER_27]: And I don't think it's something that should be further looked into between the team and city staff.

1760
03:11:40,563 --> 03:11:45,506
[SPEAKER_27]: But I don't think it's something, hopefully, that should hold up this project any longer than it has to.

1761
03:11:51,230 --> 03:11:52,431
[SPEAKER_30]: Danielle, did you have a question?

1762
03:11:54,028 --> 03:11:58,341
[SPEAKER_32]: Um, yes, I was, I was wondering not to call Peter out, but it's.

1763
03:12:00,342 --> 03:12:02,503
[SPEAKER_32]: What kind of condition would you recommend?

1764
03:12:02,723 --> 03:12:06,404
[SPEAKER_32]: Because I don't have, I can't get a hold of Todd at, you know, 10 o'clock at night.

1765
03:12:06,424 --> 03:12:12,166
[SPEAKER_32]: So I did ping him a little bit about this, but like, you know, what if there was like a sensor or some kind of detection thing?

1766
03:12:12,206 --> 03:12:13,766
[SPEAKER_32]: Like, I'm like, what are these things called?

1767
03:12:13,806 --> 03:12:15,667
[SPEAKER_32]: You know, I'm just like throwing words out there.

1768
03:12:15,967 --> 03:12:19,828
[SPEAKER_27]: I, I, I am definitely, I really seen they're all over the place.

1769
03:12:20,008 --> 03:12:23,189
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, there's, there's a whole, there's a whole category.

1770
03:12:23,209 --> 03:12:27,131
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, they're mostly used for, uh, for usually, uh,

1771
03:12:29,523 --> 03:12:39,005
[SPEAKER_27]: parking garages, I've seen them, but I definitely, I, I know there are smaller, I mean, there are smaller scale ones as well.

1772
03:12:39,045 --> 03:12:49,827
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, there's definitely something you can do with just like, it's just like a light and a light and a wire loop connected to each other.

1773
03:12:49,847 --> 03:12:55,108
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know that I don't have the, I don't know the technical side of it off the top of my head, but I know it's something that exists.

1774
03:12:56,831 --> 03:13:06,999
[SPEAKER_20]: And I can definitely reach out to the developer on 3036 Salem Street and find out what they're utilizing in that project.

1775
03:13:07,540 --> 03:13:08,621
[SPEAKER_20]: I have no problem doing that.

1776
03:13:10,382 --> 03:13:21,250
[SPEAKER_32]: So through the chair, I would recommend a condition of the site plan approval, some kind of

1777
03:13:24,087 --> 03:13:25,328
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't even know what you call them.

1778
03:13:25,628 --> 03:13:28,469
[SPEAKER_32]: Some kind of sensor or vehicle detection warning system.

1779
03:13:29,730 --> 03:13:39,995
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, it would be a, I think the best term would be a exiting vehicle detection.

1780
03:13:40,015 --> 03:13:43,377
[SPEAKER_32]: OK, that makes sense.

1781
03:13:44,898 --> 03:13:53,622
[SPEAKER_32]: And then the two meters, the two smart meters, which would encourage turnover in front of the site for that retail use.

1782
03:13:57,017 --> 03:14:06,020
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry to interrupt, I just want to clarify that I'm making an assumption from what you just said, and I just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.

1783
03:14:06,500 --> 03:14:25,347
[SPEAKER_21]: We're suggesting they install meters of the city's meters that the city had, that the Medford parking department is deploying around the city and that they would install two of the meters currently being deployed by the city at that location, correct?

1784
03:14:26,467 --> 03:14:33,034
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, purchase and install two meters as specifications of Medford parking.

1785
03:14:33,775 --> 03:14:33,975
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1786
03:14:34,075 --> 03:14:34,256
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1787
03:14:34,296 --> 03:14:40,663
[SPEAKER_21]: I just wanted to make sure that we were very clear that it was parking department specifications.

1788
03:14:43,085 --> 03:14:43,406
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1789
03:14:54,871 --> 03:15:00,196
[SPEAKER_30]: I just want to, Amanda, are you capturing the conditions?

1790
03:15:01,377 --> 03:15:09,065
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'm just wondering how these conditions will align with the traffic comments that have already been submitted.

1791
03:15:09,085 --> 03:15:15,491
[SPEAKER_30]: Are we looking to add or just focusing on a few of them?

1792
03:15:17,613 --> 03:15:19,795
[SPEAKER_30]: And that's more of a question for the board.

1793
03:15:27,334 --> 03:15:36,181
[SPEAKER_30]: And Dr. Hunt, is that your way of actually mitigating for the vehicle conflict and you'll be okay with that?

1794
03:15:36,701 --> 03:15:36,961
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

1795
03:15:40,884 --> 03:15:41,144
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

1796
03:15:44,227 --> 03:15:48,530
[SPEAKER_30]: If there's no further questions from the board at this time, I'm going to open it up for public comment.

1797
03:15:53,397 --> 03:15:57,560
[SPEAKER_30]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message landed in the comments.

1798
03:15:57,620 --> 03:16:02,884
[SPEAKER_30]: You can also send an email to OCD at method-ma.gov.

1799
03:16:03,404 --> 03:16:05,506
[SPEAKER_30]: Individuals have up to three minutes to provide comment.

1800
03:16:05,746 --> 03:16:08,708
[SPEAKER_30]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

1801
03:16:09,108 --> 03:16:16,073
[SPEAKER_30]: A reminder to all the meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

1802
03:16:16,173 --> 03:16:22,938
[SPEAKER_30]: However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself

1803
03:16:23,178 --> 03:16:23,658
[SPEAKER_30]: and staff.

1804
03:16:24,438 --> 03:16:30,001
[SPEAKER_30]: Amanda, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent in emails or letters?

1805
03:16:31,161 --> 03:16:31,781
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1806
03:16:31,901 --> 03:16:36,123
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have not received any comments ahead of the meeting from the public.

1807
03:16:36,823 --> 03:16:44,286
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just taking a look now to make sure nothing's come into our inbox during the meeting.

1808
03:16:44,766 --> 03:16:45,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1809
03:16:45,866 --> 03:16:47,347
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see no hands raised.

1810
03:16:52,490 --> 03:16:55,531
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm going to close the public comment period at this point.

1811
03:16:56,332 --> 03:16:58,753
[SPEAKER_30]: And just return back to the board.

1812
03:17:00,313 --> 03:17:02,454
[SPEAKER_30]: To discuss potential conditions for approval.

1813
03:17:03,215 --> 03:17:05,216
[SPEAKER_30]: If we're going to give approval to move forward.

1814
03:17:06,076 --> 03:17:08,257
[SPEAKER_30]: If you have any clarifying questions.

1815
03:17:09,798 --> 03:17:13,439
[SPEAKER_30]: And again, my only clarifying question moving forward is.

1816
03:17:14,200 --> 03:17:19,222
[SPEAKER_30]: At this point, I think the site plan, I would myself recommend the site plan for.

1817
03:17:21,467 --> 03:17:27,991
[SPEAKER_30]: For approval, considering everything has been adhered to as part of the department heads.

1818
03:17:29,532 --> 03:17:33,854
[SPEAKER_30]: Comment and anything that the city staff has added this evening.

1819
03:17:40,218 --> 03:17:42,539
[SPEAKER_30]: If there's no additional questions.

1820
03:17:47,562 --> 03:17:49,363
[SPEAKER_30]: And if you agree, then I would.

1821
03:17:51,684 --> 03:17:58,567
[SPEAKER_30]: elicit a motion that says such, but with Amanda reading out the additional conditions for us.

1822
03:18:03,350 --> 03:18:03,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair?

1823
03:18:04,550 --> 03:18:04,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1824
03:18:05,511 --> 03:18:09,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to read what I've got down and we can always wordsmith together.

1825
03:18:09,753 --> 03:18:17,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I know also our new clerk, Peter may have captured additional or different language.

1826
03:18:18,277 --> 03:18:18,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1827
03:18:19,554 --> 03:18:33,598
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I have is applicant to furnish and install two electric parking meters per the parking department specifications at the existing on-street public parking spots in front of the site as condition one.

1828
03:18:36,959 --> 03:18:46,022
[SPEAKER_03]: And then number two, applicant to furnish and install an exiting vehicle detection and warning system on the right-of-way to signal when vehicles are exiting the drive.

1829
03:18:47,683 --> 03:18:49,043
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah, that's what I have as well.

1830
03:18:50,815 --> 03:18:59,499
[SPEAKER_27]: And just a question for Jackie with the last thing you said.

1831
03:18:59,999 --> 03:19:08,243
[SPEAKER_27]: Do we want to include a condition to ensure coordination with city departments on the other comments?

1832
03:19:08,883 --> 03:19:12,985
[SPEAKER_27]: Or are those being, do we feel that those are already being addressed?

1833
03:19:13,534 --> 03:19:30,589
[SPEAKER_30]: I think they're already being addressed, but just to cover it, I wanted to just condition that I didn't want to let it go without making note to the comments and without the actual representative, the department heads here themselves, just to make sure that they're touching base and compliant.

1834
03:19:33,111 --> 03:19:33,712
[SPEAKER_21]: Madam chair.

1835
03:19:34,232 --> 03:19:34,452
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1836
03:19:34,773 --> 03:19:38,416
[SPEAKER_21]: I just sort of wanted to flag for you that like usual,

1837
03:19:39,732 --> 03:19:45,757
[SPEAKER_21]: Frequently, we'll have response of department comments to stuff because of the holiday weekend.

1838
03:19:45,837 --> 03:19:48,500
[SPEAKER_21]: It was really hard for the department heads to get letters.

1839
03:19:48,980 --> 03:19:56,767
[SPEAKER_21]: And I noted that in the engineering and traffic comments, some of the requests were addressed in the plan submitted here.

1840
03:19:56,787 --> 03:20:00,070
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think that's fairly clear to all of us.

1841
03:20:02,071 --> 03:20:03,172
[SPEAKER_21]: But there were some that,

1842
03:20:04,293 --> 03:20:06,954
[SPEAKER_21]: they couldn't be addressed by the plans, right?

1843
03:20:06,974 --> 03:20:11,417
[SPEAKER_21]: There's stuff like the restoration of the public way should be blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?

1844
03:20:11,837 --> 03:20:15,119
[SPEAKER_27]: That's something- For certain utility specifications.

1845
03:20:15,559 --> 03:20:15,839
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1846
03:20:15,979 --> 03:20:20,981
[SPEAKER_21]: So we need some language to incorporate the

1847
03:20:23,812 --> 03:20:41,360
[SPEAKER_21]: My difficulty here is that I feel that we need to incorporate the comments that are still relevant, whereas there are some that are not, and I'm not sure that it's appropriate to just leave it up to the judgment by saying the relevant comments should be incorporated, right?

1848
03:20:42,281 --> 03:20:49,244
[SPEAKER_21]: For example, there was one, one of the very early ones was around the easement configuration, entrance and exit.

1849
03:20:49,620 --> 03:20:55,123
[SPEAKER_21]: I do believe that settled I do believe that our conversations with the city engineer and traffic.

1850
03:20:56,444 --> 03:21:02,887
[SPEAKER_21]: Director this evening has indicated that they're no longer looking for that that easement change.

1851
03:21:04,368 --> 03:21:10,231
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I, I'm not sure what the best way to handle the fact other than.

1852
03:21:11,311 --> 03:21:15,715
[SPEAKER_21]: And I hate to suggest this at 10 o'clock at night, going through each of them.

1853
03:21:16,135 --> 03:21:22,320
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, honestly, the appropriate thing to do is to go through each comment and say, number one is no longer relevant.

1854
03:21:22,680 --> 03:21:25,943
[SPEAKER_21]: Number two, confirm where people stand.

1855
03:21:26,123 --> 03:21:30,306
[SPEAKER_21]: Three, the applicant accepts it, and we're going to incorporate three.

1856
03:21:31,768 --> 03:21:38,033
[SPEAKER_21]: If somebody has a better suggestion that's quicker because this goes on for four pages, I would appreciate it.

1857
03:21:44,211 --> 03:22:05,620
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we can agree to everything with the exception of comment one in the engineering, which deals with the proposed easement, and then comment 13 in the traffic comments, which- It's just a restatement of- Correct.

1858
03:22:06,852 --> 03:22:13,634
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the only other item, and I'll defer to Amanda with this, I think that the fire chiefs number 7.

1859
03:22:15,575 --> 03:22:24,038
[SPEAKER_20]: Was just his standard language that he places in on traffic flow, because we did have a meeting with him and he was satisfied.

1860
03:22:24,798 --> 03:22:29,103
[SPEAKER_20]: based on our changes to the plan which have been incorporated.

1861
03:22:29,743 --> 03:22:33,287
[SPEAKER_20]: We made that sidewalk flush with the drive area.

1862
03:22:33,707 --> 03:22:35,649
[SPEAKER_20]: We reduced the landscaping in that area.

1863
03:22:36,750 --> 03:22:42,856
[SPEAKER_20]: He was fine with that right-of-way and having access to the back as well through the 10-foot right-of-way.

1864
03:22:43,857 --> 03:22:47,821
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the only comment that I wouldn't want to get hung up on from the fire chief.

1865
03:22:49,663 --> 03:22:52,086
[SPEAKER_20]: Because that isn't what the understanding was.

1866
03:22:52,306 --> 03:22:55,490
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think that Amanda checked back with him, but I can't.

1867
03:22:55,510 --> 03:22:57,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe he issued a new letter.

1868
03:22:57,333 --> 03:22:57,773
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he not?

1869
03:22:58,794 --> 03:23:01,198
[SPEAKER_03]: He said he would, but I don't know that he got around to it.

1870
03:23:01,238 --> 03:23:04,902
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have in writing that we can strike number 7 from that memo.

1871
03:23:09,822 --> 03:23:10,102
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1872
03:23:10,142 --> 03:23:19,786
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think we have a solution here is to incorporate the department heads comments with the exception of the ones that Kathy just stated.

1873
03:23:19,806 --> 03:23:19,886
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1874
03:23:20,846 --> 03:23:22,767
[SPEAKER_21]: As long as it's comfortable with that.

1875
03:23:22,787 --> 03:23:24,708
[SPEAKER_32]: It was one and two.

1876
03:23:26,928 --> 03:23:28,349
[SPEAKER_27]: One, we had one and 13.

1877
03:23:29,049 --> 03:23:29,549
[SPEAKER_32]: Not two.

1878
03:23:32,130 --> 03:23:36,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I think two should be struck, but I let attorney Desmond respond to that.

1879
03:23:38,752 --> 03:23:39,833
[SPEAKER_10]: You're muted Kathleen.

1880
03:23:40,193 --> 03:23:40,973
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, yes.

1881
03:23:43,214 --> 03:23:47,016
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yes, that one looks like it be included under that conversation.

1882
03:23:47,036 --> 03:23:47,876
[SPEAKER_32]: So I have 1, 2, 13. 16.

1883
03:23:59,268 --> 03:24:02,350
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, yes, that would be another 1 that I believe should be struck as.

1884
03:24:02,370 --> 03:24:05,831
[SPEAKER_27]: Uh, given our conversation tonight, it doesn't seem that.

1885
03:24:06,452 --> 03:24:09,893
[SPEAKER_27]: There is any intent for commercial use of the rear parking lot.

1886
03:24:10,433 --> 03:24:25,041
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't know about 18, but I think that's board.

1887
03:24:27,322 --> 03:24:27,842
[SPEAKER_32]: For you all to.

1888
03:24:30,083 --> 03:24:30,644
[SPEAKER_35]: Discuss.

1889
03:24:38,290 --> 03:24:39,831
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't have an objection to it.

1890
03:24:39,972 --> 03:24:42,294
[SPEAKER_20]: So, uh, if the board, you know.

1891
03:24:45,476 --> 03:24:51,922
[SPEAKER_27]: I think I think particularly seeing and there's as and this is just my 2 sentences.

1892
03:24:54,183 --> 03:25:02,445
[SPEAKER_27]: that particularly seeing is how the parking lot is restricted to residential use now.

1893
03:25:02,605 --> 03:25:18,190
[SPEAKER_27]: I think if there's somewhere we can put language in there that make sure that people use it, use it if they're going to have cars and don't take up any

1894
03:25:19,712 --> 03:25:25,200
[SPEAKER_27]: present or future residential parking spaces on the street, that would be preferable.

1895
03:25:25,300 --> 03:25:27,804
[SPEAKER_27]: But like I said, that's my two cents.

1896
03:25:31,670 --> 03:25:33,172
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd be fine incorporating 18.

1897
03:25:51,255 --> 03:25:55,138
[SPEAKER_30]: And this is a heavy TOD area, correct, as presented?

1898
03:25:57,319 --> 03:25:58,040
[SPEAKER_32]: It qualifies.

1899
03:25:58,060 --> 03:25:59,321
[SPEAKER_32]: It qualifies.

1900
03:26:07,407 --> 03:26:18,595
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, my, I know it's not a thing much with the advent of Uber and other personal, and other taxi services, but like, I know when, um,

1901
03:26:20,401 --> 03:26:24,562
[SPEAKER_30]: Tenants say that they're not going to have parking, then they'll get like a rental or a zip car or something like that.

1902
03:26:24,602 --> 03:26:27,263
[SPEAKER_30]: And then you still create an on-street.

1903
03:26:27,283 --> 03:26:29,583
[SPEAKER_30]: So I'm good with keeping 18 in.

1904
03:26:34,804 --> 03:26:36,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam chair, may I make a comment?

1905
03:26:36,525 --> 03:26:36,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1906
03:26:37,865 --> 03:26:47,187
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the event that the parking spaces are assigned to a unit, this comment is moot, correct?

1907
03:26:51,100 --> 03:26:58,076
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, so going back to that, will there be a sign parking?

1908
03:26:59,990 --> 03:27:08,756
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you know, I guess the question, I think at this point, the petitioner is going to sell the units, at least that's the plan at this point.

1909
03:27:08,816 --> 03:27:15,060
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would assume there would be deeded parking, nine units for each of the nine units would have one space.

1910
03:27:15,921 --> 03:27:21,685
[SPEAKER_20]: It's still up in the air as to whether that 10 space would be a visitor space or some other.

1911
03:27:22,365 --> 03:27:24,266
[SPEAKER_20]: you know, one unit gets two spaces.

1912
03:27:24,326 --> 03:27:26,328
[SPEAKER_20]: That hasn't been designated as of yet.

1913
03:27:26,408 --> 03:27:28,789
[SPEAKER_20]: But each vehicle will have one space.

1914
03:27:29,149 --> 03:27:31,411
[SPEAKER_20]: Each unit will have one space designated.

1915
03:27:35,093 --> 03:27:39,156
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't know if you want language in the condo docks to that effect, I guess, or rentals.

1916
03:27:42,058 --> 03:27:45,080
[SPEAKER_32]: Well, that one space should probably be the EV charging station.

1917
03:27:47,341 --> 03:27:48,842
[SPEAKER_32]: So that could swap around.

1918
03:27:55,904 --> 03:28:04,470
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, we can sort that out with city staff and in terms of, you know, if in terms of that 10th space.

1919
03:28:09,993 --> 03:28:18,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Just back to that item 18, if, if the cases at the, uh, the spaces are assigned, then there's no need to have any additional language to restrict the tenants.

1920
03:28:19,680 --> 03:28:21,241
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no impact on on street parking.

1921
03:28:29,272 --> 03:28:44,958
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that's true because if we're not unbundling as item 18 is concerned about, if the plan is to sell the units and to then have the deeded parking, then you wouldn't have that effect at all.

1922
03:28:47,339 --> 03:28:47,839
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.

1923
03:28:52,061 --> 03:28:55,702
[SPEAKER_30]: This is only relevant if there was an incentive to not have parking as

1924
03:29:01,014 --> 03:29:09,140
[SPEAKER_20]: Right, the requirement on this was actually seven spaces, but we're provided 10 so that each unit has a space and there was one additional space.

1925
03:29:09,701 --> 03:29:19,648
[SPEAKER_20]: So under the high frequency, we could have went with seven spaces, but we've got 10 in the back with the intent that each unit would have its own space.

1926
03:29:24,752 --> 03:29:27,294
[SPEAKER_30]: OK, so to recap, we are striking

1927
03:29:30,863 --> 03:29:31,843
[SPEAKER_30]: Peter, can you help me?

1928
03:29:32,043 --> 03:29:33,384
[SPEAKER_30]: We're getting rid of one.

1929
03:29:37,826 --> 03:29:38,306
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may?

1930
03:29:38,926 --> 03:29:39,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1931
03:29:40,407 --> 03:29:46,309
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're striking item number 7 on the fire memo and items 1, 2, 13, and 16 on the engineering memo.

1932
03:29:46,329 --> 03:29:46,409
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1933
03:29:46,489 --> 03:29:46,569
[SPEAKER_03]: And 18.

1934
03:29:46,609 --> 03:29:46,689
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1935
03:29:58,767 --> 03:30:06,614
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, I think we should say we're striking 18, even though it has become moot, but just for administrative clarification, just say we're striking 18.

1936
03:30:06,654 --> 03:30:12,019
[SPEAKER_27]: Because we're not going to, the applicant is not going to follow through with the condition.

1937
03:30:12,559 --> 03:30:15,222
[SPEAKER_27]: But in this case, it's because they don't need to.

1938
03:30:19,586 --> 03:30:22,989
[SPEAKER_30]: And which one, I'm sorry, what number on fire?

1939
03:30:23,009 --> 03:30:22,989
7.

1940
03:30:23,029 --> 03:30:22,989
7. 7.

1941
03:30:35,348 --> 03:30:35,748
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

1942
03:30:40,372 --> 03:30:53,801
[SPEAKER_30]: If we can sort of wordsmith this to get a motion to recommend with the removal of comments.

1943
03:30:53,821 --> 03:31:01,767
[SPEAKER_30]: Do we even have to, do we have to explicitly name out the comments that were taken out, striking?

1944
03:31:05,541 --> 03:31:05,941
[SPEAKER_30]: If I may?

1945
03:31:06,502 --> 03:31:06,722
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes.

1946
03:31:07,982 --> 03:31:11,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that I feel like we've detailed it.

1947
03:31:11,704 --> 03:31:15,046
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to read what, what I've written down.

1948
03:31:15,106 --> 03:31:17,267
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, if you all want to change it, we can.

1949
03:31:19,555 --> 03:31:21,115
[SPEAKER_30]: If you can give it a shot, Amanda.

1950
03:31:21,576 --> 03:31:22,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

1951
03:31:22,276 --> 03:31:27,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So I believe the motion would be to approve the site plan with the following conditions.

1952
03:31:28,617 --> 03:31:37,300
[SPEAKER_03]: The applicant to furnish and install two electric parking meters per the parking department specifications at the existing on-street public parking spots in front of the site.

1953
03:31:38,260 --> 03:31:44,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Applicant to furnish and install an exiting vehicle detection and warning system on the right of way to signal when vehicles are exiting the drive.

1954
03:31:45,444 --> 03:31:55,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And applicant to incorporate the department head's comments with the exception of item number seven on the fire department memo and items number one, two, 13, 16, 18 on the engineering memo.

1955
03:32:05,039 --> 03:32:09,062
[SPEAKER_27]: That sounds like what I have written down, at least in my bulleted list.

1956
03:32:13,685 --> 03:32:20,090
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd like to make a motion to accept with conditions as Amanda laid out.

1957
03:32:21,831 --> 03:32:22,292
[SPEAKER_30]: Second.

1958
03:32:22,312 --> 03:32:27,415
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, roll call vote.

1959
03:32:28,156 --> 03:32:29,517
[SPEAKER_30]: Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

1960
03:32:30,578 --> 03:32:30,738
[SPEAKER_30]: Aye.

1961
03:32:32,039 --> 03:32:32,699
[SPEAKER_30]: Peter Cowles?

1962
03:32:33,700 --> 03:32:33,780
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_30]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1970
03:32:48,280 --> 03:32:52,784
[SPEAKER_30]: I am an aye.

1971
03:32:52,944 --> 03:32:55,185
[SPEAKER_30]: Your site plan has been approved.

1972
03:32:55,686 --> 03:32:56,967
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you so much for your time.

1973
03:32:57,767 --> 03:32:59,028
[SPEAKER_30]: Would you like to say something, Rick?

1974
03:32:59,469 --> 03:33:00,389
[SPEAKER_34]: No, I say thank you.

1975
03:33:01,450 --> 03:33:02,431
[SPEAKER_34]: I just stay quiet.

1976
03:33:02,471 --> 03:33:03,872
[SPEAKER_34]: I just stay quiet for this meeting.

1977
03:33:03,892 --> 03:33:04,833
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

1978
03:33:06,947 --> 03:33:07,267
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1979
03:33:07,287 --> 03:33:07,868
[SPEAKER_20]: We appreciate it.

1980
03:33:07,888 --> 03:33:09,049
[SPEAKER_20]: And we appreciate the late hour.

1981
03:33:09,069 --> 03:33:11,450
[SPEAKER_20]: I know everybody's tired.

1982
03:33:13,191 --> 03:33:13,892
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1983
03:33:13,912 --> 03:33:16,054
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1984
03:33:16,074 --> 03:33:16,974
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1985
03:33:19,916 --> 03:33:20,357
[SPEAKER_30]: Good night.

1986
03:33:21,017 --> 03:33:21,457
[SPEAKER_30]: Good night.

1987
03:33:25,020 --> 03:33:27,221
[SPEAKER_30]: So the next item is approval of minutes.

1988
03:33:27,542 --> 03:33:30,224
[SPEAKER_30]: Um, a motion to approve the minutes from June 21st, 23.

1989
03:33:38,628 --> 03:33:39,388
[SPEAKER_30]: Is there a second?

1990
03:33:42,230 --> 03:33:43,270
[SPEAKER_30]: Emily wasn't here.

1991
03:33:43,290 --> 03:33:44,771
[SPEAKER_32]: Second.

1992
03:33:45,191 --> 03:33:45,451
[SPEAKER_32]: Pam.

1993
03:33:47,212 --> 03:33:47,872
[SPEAKER_30]: Pam second.

1994
03:33:50,053 --> 03:33:50,673
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

1995
03:33:52,154 --> 03:33:58,357
[SPEAKER_30]: I think Emily, you can still, if I'm not mistaken, you can vote to accept the minutes as is.

1996
03:33:58,717 --> 03:34:02,339
[SPEAKER_30]: So we've established that with city staff, correct?

1997
03:34:02,879 --> 03:34:03,199
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

1998
03:34:03,319 --> 03:34:05,040
[SPEAKER_30]: Even though you weren't here for the meeting.

1999
03:34:06,160 --> 03:34:06,341
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

2000
03:34:06,361 --> 03:34:06,981
[SPEAKER_29]: That sounds good.

2001
03:34:07,001 --> 03:34:07,321
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2002
03:34:08,172 --> 03:34:09,393
[SPEAKER_30]: Vice-chair Emily Hedeman.

2003
03:34:10,753 --> 03:34:11,173
[SPEAKER_29]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_30]: Hey, there's miscellaneous.

2014
03:34:34,629 --> 03:34:37,710
[SPEAKER_30]: I have another update before we go to miscellaneous another update.

2015
03:34:38,451 --> 03:34:39,991
[SPEAKER_30]: Very happy birthday to Alicia.

2016
03:34:40,011 --> 03:34:44,153
[SPEAKER_29]: Happy birthday, Alicia.

2017
03:34:45,054 --> 03:34:47,255
[SPEAKER_29]: Thanks for all you do.

2018
03:34:49,415 --> 03:34:49,935
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

2019
03:34:49,995 --> 03:34:56,118
[SPEAKER_29]: If it's so late, I'd make a motion to sing Happy Birthday.

2020
03:34:56,458 --> 03:34:57,438
[SPEAKER_21]: That's OK.

2021
03:34:58,218 --> 03:35:06,421
[SPEAKER_21]: Because it's so late, I'll say, my dear friend, my senior year prom date, we were each other's prom date, called me.

2022
03:35:06,501 --> 03:35:09,402
[SPEAKER_21]: He always calls on my birthday, and he sang to me this morning.

2023
03:35:10,283 --> 03:35:11,203
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, I love that.

2024
03:35:11,683 --> 03:35:12,003
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

2025
03:35:17,428 --> 03:35:22,170
[SPEAKER_30]: Did the city have any other updates or miscellaneous that you wanted to give us?

2026
03:35:23,971 --> 03:35:28,132
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just quickly mention that, well, first, y'all are amazing.

2027
03:35:28,152 --> 03:35:28,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Great job tonight.

2028
03:35:29,793 --> 03:35:46,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, the next meeting is on September 20th, and I think so far the only agenda item that's confirmed is this board will see the 243 Mystic Ave PDD application once again.

2029
03:35:47,520 --> 03:36:03,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been referred, automatically referred back to the board from city council, and the board will review it one more time and make a decision on whether or not to recommend it or make any adjustments back to city council for their final public hearing and vote.

2030
03:36:03,932 --> 03:36:08,135
[SPEAKER_27]: Is that Verdon bio?

2031
03:36:08,676 --> 03:36:09,496
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes, yes.

2032
03:36:09,756 --> 03:36:10,077
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

2033
03:36:10,797 --> 03:36:11,137
[SPEAKER_27]: Sorry.

2034
03:36:11,217 --> 03:36:11,478
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

2035
03:36:12,480 --> 03:36:13,041
[SPEAKER_27]: No problem.

2036
03:36:13,061 --> 03:36:13,721
[SPEAKER_27]: Just trying to remember.

2037
03:36:13,941 --> 03:36:14,762
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's the one.

2038
03:36:15,522 --> 03:36:16,523
[SPEAKER_27]: Was that my first meeting?

2039
03:36:16,543 --> 03:36:16,623
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah.

2040
03:36:18,224 --> 03:36:22,967
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of the PDDs at this point.

2041
03:36:23,047 --> 03:36:24,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else, Alicia or Danielle?

2042
03:36:26,008 --> 03:36:33,313
[SPEAKER_32]: September 13th, we're going to have a public input meeting to present the draft MBTA zoning overlay.

2043
03:36:34,353 --> 03:36:38,056
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's one week from tonight.

2044
03:36:38,356 --> 03:36:41,558
[SPEAKER_21]: Tomorrow, we'll be working on the public outreach for that meeting.

2045
03:36:44,443 --> 03:36:53,854
[SPEAKER_21]: And along those lines, we are working to move the administration of this from Amanda to Danielle, something that's actually going to help with that.

2046
03:36:54,175 --> 03:36:58,139
[SPEAKER_21]: So we do have a new administrative assistant starting in our office on Monday.

2047
03:36:59,460 --> 03:37:07,982
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I'm hoping that some of the administrative things, posting of minutes, you know, sending in of legal ads, mailings will be done by.

2048
03:37:08,002 --> 03:37:09,923
[SPEAKER_21]: His name is Jonathan.

2049
03:37:10,723 --> 03:37:17,865
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't truly expect that he would be reaching out to the board for any reason, but he might for like purely administrative

2050
03:37:18,425 --> 03:37:20,526
[SPEAKER_21]: purposes, paperwork type things.

2051
03:37:21,286 --> 03:37:29,809
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you do start to see a Jonathan Cabral being CC'd on our emails, he is the new administrative assistant starting on Monday.

2052
03:37:29,829 --> 03:37:33,390
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

2053
03:37:34,048 --> 03:37:39,492
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, and we're still hiring for an economic development planner and an economic development director.

2054
03:37:40,113 --> 03:37:41,754
[SPEAKER_21]: The postings are still up.

2055
03:37:42,354 --> 03:37:45,397
[SPEAKER_21]: Please share it and refer people our way.

2056
03:37:45,417 --> 03:37:54,484
[SPEAKER_21]: I might be doing economic development planner interviews next week, but without a full-time administrative assistant, getting some of this scheduled is really tough.

2057
03:37:56,450 --> 03:37:59,411
[SPEAKER_21]: And the city is moving forward with interviews for building commissioner.

2058
03:38:00,211 --> 03:38:08,852
[SPEAKER_21]: If you know anybody who would be a great applicant, you could still forward them, but I have been participating in interviews for the building commissioner position.

2059
03:38:10,613 --> 03:38:12,633
[SPEAKER_21]: So it is moving along.

2060
03:38:14,473 --> 03:38:19,694
[SPEAKER_30]: And I have a quick one and I promise this is really quick and it helps us with the organization of the meetings.

2061
03:38:20,074 --> 03:38:24,175
[SPEAKER_30]: I wanted the board to, for us to start thinking about rules and regulations for how we

2062
03:38:26,150 --> 03:38:27,892
[SPEAKER_30]: on how the board actually operates.

2063
03:38:28,192 --> 03:38:37,461
[SPEAKER_30]: And something I spoke to Danielle about is, like, I don't know if there's a way that we can legally impose, like, deadlines for proponents to send things in.

2064
03:38:37,481 --> 03:38:43,206
[SPEAKER_30]: If they send it in on a Friday after certain hours and then the city doesn't have a chance to get to it or it gets to us later.

2065
03:38:43,226 --> 03:38:51,113
[SPEAKER_30]: It's just something legally that we're able to do to help us with, to help the city with their lift and then to help us to have a little bit more time

2066
03:38:51,854 --> 03:38:58,996
[SPEAKER_27]: With our list, um, yeah, so we don't run into a situation where we don't have where the city doesn't have time to get its responses.

2067
03:38:59,016 --> 03:39:16,680
[SPEAKER_32]: So we're kind of Operating without the city's the city's thoughts when we get to our meeting Yeah, we were literally like scrambling for info And fact finding like right up and during the meeting it's just like yeah impossible, so

2068
03:39:17,717 --> 03:39:25,547
[SPEAKER_30]: And again, I don't know the legalities behind if we can even talk about it because it's not really an item on agenda, but it's an item for ourselves as administrative.

2069
03:39:25,587 --> 03:39:27,189
[SPEAKER_30]: So I think we can talk about it in email.

2070
03:39:27,249 --> 03:39:29,271
[SPEAKER_30]: Is that correct?

2071
03:39:29,772 --> 03:39:32,976
[SPEAKER_30]: No, because it's going to be part of the board's actions.

2072
03:39:33,076 --> 03:39:34,077
[SPEAKER_30]: So we can't talk about it.

2073
03:39:35,365 --> 03:39:38,367
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know, just not for tonight, but just to put it in your head.

2074
03:39:38,447 --> 03:39:42,070
[SPEAKER_30]: What can we do to help ourselves?

2075
03:39:42,450 --> 03:39:50,195
[SPEAKER_32]: Yeah, and I can look at other examples from other cities, see what best practices are, and then give you guys something to react to.

2076
03:39:52,216 --> 03:39:57,040
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't think I will have time to work on this until- Ask Clem.

2077
03:39:57,420 --> 03:39:57,920
[SPEAKER_32]: Next month.

2078
03:39:58,020 --> 03:39:58,821
[SPEAKER_21]: That's a great idea.

2079
03:39:59,201 --> 03:39:59,621
[SPEAKER_21]: Ask Clem.

2080
03:39:59,801 --> 03:40:04,705
[SPEAKER_21]: We have a great intern who is planning to work 30 hours a week for us this semester.

2081
03:40:06,041 --> 03:40:09,083
[SPEAKER_21]: We have several interns, but he's working 30 hours a week.

2082
03:40:10,264 --> 03:40:17,990
[SPEAKER_29]: I remember the city of Somerville having like a really robust process in terms of like, you know, you need to get your stuff in on this date and I'll be heard at this meeting.

2083
03:40:18,850 --> 03:40:20,512
[SPEAKER_29]: I can try to find it.

2084
03:40:21,953 --> 03:40:31,600
[SPEAKER_32]: But yeah, that's true, like, zoning board, like, if we didn't, if it wasn't in our packet on Friday, before the meeting, we wouldn't look at it.

2085
03:40:33,016 --> 03:40:35,777
[SPEAKER_32]: I showed up at my seat and I had plans there.

2086
03:40:35,817 --> 03:40:36,857
[SPEAKER_32]: I'd be like, what is this?

2087
03:40:36,877 --> 03:40:39,218
[SPEAKER_32]: I didn't have time to look at this.

2088
03:40:39,238 --> 03:40:40,939
[SPEAKER_32]: And it'd all get grumpy and mad.

2089
03:40:40,959 --> 03:40:42,980
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah.

2090
03:40:43,360 --> 03:40:46,641
[SPEAKER_30]: Even the close of Business Friday, is that pushing it for you guys?

2091
03:40:46,681 --> 03:40:50,102
[SPEAKER_32]: Because we get out at 12.30, so we get a lot of stuff that'll come in.

2092
03:40:51,303 --> 03:40:56,124
[SPEAKER_32]: We have a lot of late nights and we have a long Wednesday.

2093
03:40:56,144 --> 03:40:57,985
[SPEAKER_32]: So understandably,

2094
03:40:59,265 --> 03:41:06,426
[SPEAKER_32]: We try to get out somewhat on time on Fridays, because we've worked a lot of hours by the time we get to 1230.

2095
03:41:07,027 --> 03:41:08,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2096
03:41:08,827 --> 03:41:13,048
[SPEAKER_21]: So we can put it on the agenda, a review of the rules and regulations of the board.

2097
03:41:14,848 --> 03:41:19,949
[SPEAKER_21]: Amanda, I don't want to ask you, you probably have at your fingertips where those are.

2098
03:41:20,449 --> 03:41:22,010
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you think you could shoot them?

2099
03:41:22,030 --> 03:41:22,570
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

2100
03:41:24,527 --> 03:41:27,369
[SPEAKER_21]: I shouldn't assume that the new members were sent a copy of.

2101
03:41:27,509 --> 03:41:31,591
[SPEAKER_21]: We have established rules and regulations that are less than a year old.

2102
03:41:33,393 --> 03:41:37,996
[SPEAKER_21]: But that doesn't mean they shouldn't be edited to meet the needs of the current members.

2103
03:41:39,016 --> 03:41:41,778
[SPEAKER_21]: But that's also a good place for us to start.

2104
03:41:41,818 --> 03:41:43,319
[SPEAKER_21]: You should know what they currently are.

2105
03:41:43,999 --> 03:41:46,161
[SPEAKER_21]: And please feel free to hold us to them.

2106
03:41:47,582 --> 03:41:52,004
[SPEAKER_21]: Every once in a while, we try and squeeze something through because an applicant's really anxious.

2107
03:41:54,386 --> 03:41:59,030
[SPEAKER_21]: But that shouldn't, yeah.

2108
03:42:01,952 --> 03:42:08,857
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, I'm very distracted by whatever it is that the city is apparently doing on the street out there.

2109
03:42:08,917 --> 03:42:09,778
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very loud.

2110
03:42:09,798 --> 03:42:18,024
[SPEAKER_30]: No, go ahead.

2111
03:42:19,165 --> 03:42:21,767
[SPEAKER_30]: No, I was about to ask for a motion to close, so you go ahead.

2112
03:42:22,870 --> 03:42:24,470
[SPEAKER_28]: That's exactly what I was about to do.

2113
03:42:24,730 --> 03:42:27,291
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay.

2114
03:42:27,871 --> 03:42:32,272
[SPEAKER_30]: A motion to close the meeting for tonight?

2115
03:42:32,312 --> 03:42:32,692
[SPEAKER_28]: Second.

2116
03:42:35,233 --> 03:42:39,434
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm asking, I can't actually give the motion, so I need one motion and then a second.

2117
03:42:39,614 --> 03:42:44,395
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll make the motion to adjourn the meeting.

2118
03:42:44,635 --> 03:42:47,155
[SPEAKER_29]: Sorry, you want to hit me with a second?

2119
03:42:48,656 --> 03:42:49,076
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

2120
03:42:49,996 --> 03:42:50,376
[SPEAKER_29]: Next time.

2133
03:43:18,564 --> 03:43:19,345
