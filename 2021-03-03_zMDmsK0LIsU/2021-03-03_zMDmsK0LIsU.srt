[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Mary.

4
00:00:08,744 --> 00:00:20,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we're live.

5
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:21,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

7
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is five o'clock I have we have Paul.

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Paul's here.

9
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:28,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, there he is.

10
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see Paulette and John's there.

11
00:00:30,793 --> 00:00:41,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know David Murphy is going to be joining the call, but I think he's joining us a little later, Dr. Maurice.

12
00:00:43,403 --> 00:00:50,108
[SPEAKER_09]: He was in a meeting with me and him and a few other people earlier that continued after I signed off.

13
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:54,251
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think he's probably just trying to finish that up and then go over.

14
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:57,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, and his item is the last agenda item.

15
00:00:57,393 --> 00:00:59,634
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's fine, we should begin.

16
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:02,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It's five o'clock.

17
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:08,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'll do is I'm gonna start reading the agenda, the long agenda, the beginning.

[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

47
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:17,974
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I do begin, would somebody want to just keep an eye on the time?

48
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:23,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I know a lot of people have been doing great with their meetings and their time, and I just lose track of time.

49
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,581
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been going over.

50
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:27,963
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's keep an eye on the time.

51
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:32,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody want to keep it, you know, just, you know, tune me in and just say, Kathy, we're getting a little into this topic.

52
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:33,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind.

53
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:40,211
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I see Mr. Murphy, thank you, Mr. Murphy, I can see that you're, hi.

54
00:04:41,252 --> 00:04:48,017
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the meeting objective is to update the community on projects at the Medford Public Schools.

55
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:53,130
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the first item on the agenda is the Merritt High School generator.

56
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,113
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did put together some notes.

57
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to open them up right now.

58
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:19,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I went back to our last meeting because we did have so this this meeting is our we're revisiting some of the items that were on our last meeting and um, So we did talk about the generator and I was able to share the estimate and the specs with both committee members And john mclaughlin shared them with us.

59
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:26,412
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, i'm not sure if you want me to do a screen share Um, or did everybody get a chance to look at that?

60
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they did they get those the specs?

61
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:30,905
[SPEAKER_06]: You just might mention the cost.

62
00:05:31,686 --> 00:05:35,349
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so the cost is, and I'm just going to shrink this down one second.

63
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:36,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to shrink it.

64
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:39,412
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so the cost, and just move this over.

65
00:05:39,432 --> 00:05:41,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK, it's moved on the wrong side.

66
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:43,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

67
00:05:46,218 --> 00:05:50,622
[SPEAKER_02]: The cost is, oh, OK, one moment.

68
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,203
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have it, and I saved it here. $128,675.

69
00:05:58,562 --> 00:06:07,244
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question I have, John, is, you know, I just have some general questions and I can be able to just answer them.

70
00:06:07,344 --> 00:06:17,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I didn't know is, you know, I looked at the draft of the capital improvement plan and I noticed that the generator wasn't on it.

71
00:06:18,027 --> 00:06:26,509
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to know, you know, what you have for information, you know, maybe could you explain a little bit about, you know, how important

72
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:31,851
[SPEAKER_02]: replacing the generator is and what does the generator do?

73
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:42,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so maybe why it wasn't on the main capital improvements project is probably came in after we had our drafts together.

74
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:48,680
[SPEAKER_09]: But there are two generators up at Mefford High School.

75
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:52,463
[SPEAKER_09]: One runs one side of the building, one runs the other side.

76
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:59,969
[SPEAKER_09]: So the side in the front, the side where the shops are, where we are, that generator failed a while ago.

77
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,633
[SPEAKER_09]: and we're being told that we need to replace it.

78
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:10,060
[SPEAKER_09]: So I brought in a company called Kraft to have a look at it, and they never got back to me.

79
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:20,690
[SPEAKER_09]: I had the other company, Power Equipment Products, give us just an estimate for a generator, and then things didn't work out with them, and then I brought in our electrician.

80
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:22,552
[SPEAKER_09]: But in the meantime, they built

81
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:32,980
[SPEAKER_09]: the shop, the new shop and the vocational school, and they kind of put their big equipment out in front of the door that goes into the generator room.

82
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:42,846
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and then also, I was told as well that where the generator is placed it's right next to the main transformer, or the one third transformer at the high school.

83
00:07:43,747 --> 00:07:46,628
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'd have to start building walls.

84
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:51,150
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd have to start doing all kinds of construction work to make it happen.

85
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,031
[SPEAKER_09]: So I said, well, what if we do it outside?

86
00:07:54,091 --> 00:07:56,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Would that be more cost effective?

87
00:07:57,112 --> 00:08:00,913
[SPEAKER_09]: And most generators, I think, nowadays are kind of positioned outside.

88
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:03,514
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't really put them inside the buildings anymore.

89
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:05,595
[SPEAKER_09]: So I called in Gone Green.

90
00:08:06,215 --> 00:08:06,976
[SPEAKER_09]: They came in.

91
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:09,497
[SPEAKER_09]: They brought in their professional that

92
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,901
[SPEAKER_09]: that does generators and that's where that quote was generated from.

93
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:22,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically what it what that generator does is it runs about half the building, emergency lighting and heat.

94
00:08:22,063 --> 00:08:25,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, excellent.

95
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:28,465
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's excellent, because that's very important.

96
00:08:28,665 --> 00:08:30,506
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what

97
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:46,780
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, okay, the other question I had was does that cost the 128 675 does that include the labor to install and remove the old generator or are we going to incur additional costs.

98
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:55,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, what we were gonna do is abandon the generator in place in the room that it is right now, and then put the new one outside.

99
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,121
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not gonna be in the same area.

100
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:06,910
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically coming up the vote side, they'll put a pad in, we'll put the generator and we'll put some fence around it.

101
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,894
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that's where the generator would go at that point.

102
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:11,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

103
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:22,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And would it be a problem to keep the old generator, you know, in the building, you know, is there any, you know, issues that might occur if, if it was left there.

104
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:23,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Just know this.

105
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:31,489
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there definitely isn't this time we do also have some equipment from the past that's been abandoned in place up at Medford High School as well.

106
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:41,495
[SPEAKER_09]: We have an old absorption system, air conditioner system that used to run B building that's been abandoned in place.

107
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:51,842
[SPEAKER_09]: We have two sets of water tanks, hot water tanks that the previous ones before we got the grant to add the new ones, those were abandoned in place.

108
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's pretty much

109
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,604
[SPEAKER_09]: pretty much kind of how they go.

110
00:09:55,664 --> 00:09:59,265
[SPEAKER_09]: There was room in there that we were able to add the other equipment.

111
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:05,967
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and, you know, at the cost, the cost to take it out is probably prohibitive.

112
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:06,548
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

113
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:08,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

114
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:11,990
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and then, oh, my colleagues.

115
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:12,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

116
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, go ahead.

117
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

118
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let, uh, Mr. Russo.

119
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:16,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

120
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:17,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I just have a few questions.

121
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:19,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, thank you, John, for the report as always.

122
00:10:20,113 --> 00:10:20,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,

123
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,749
[SPEAKER_04]: when did the generator actually go out?

124
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:29,652
[SPEAKER_09]: It went out, I wanna say it's been about a year now.

125
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:32,993
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of come along with everything else.

126
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:45,019
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been pretty, I don't know the exact date, but I do know that the generator was, you know what, when we went to the city council,

127
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,261
[SPEAKER_09]: about a year and a half ago to get the and they were gracious enough to give us the 325.

128
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:53,802
[SPEAKER_09]: It was out then.

129
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:55,702
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's been out about over a year.

130
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:57,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

131
00:10:57,463 --> 00:11:00,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And who who said we had to replace it?

132
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:03,965
[SPEAKER_04]: You said it had to be you were told to replace?

133
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:11,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, the company Power Products, they're the ones that test out all our generators and they come in yearly and do our testing.

134
00:11:12,328 --> 00:11:17,610
[SPEAKER_09]: They told me that the generator was, yeah, it was pretty much finished and that it couldn't really be repaired.

135
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:26,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they said they can do, they said, well, we'll do a $12,000 repair or a $15,000 repair, but we're not gonna guarantee it.

136
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:27,895
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

137
00:11:27,975 --> 00:11:35,118
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like, the best recommendation that I could get on it was to replace it.

138
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:36,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

139
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:39,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know what the life expectancy of the new one is?

140
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,219
[SPEAKER_09]: Not, I don't exactly know.

141
00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:52,363
[SPEAKER_09]: I would probably, I could make some phone calls and I could certainly find out the life expectancy, but I got to figure it's 20 years anyways.

142
00:11:52,383 --> 00:11:54,123
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.

143
00:11:54,203 --> 00:12:02,007
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't know if there's, you know, I think about when I buy a hot water heater for my house, I can choose the short,

144
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,024
[SPEAKER_04]: the cheaper one that will die sooner or the longer one that will last?

145
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:07,524
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what?

146
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:08,906
[SPEAKER_09]: I can certainly find that out.

147
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:10,007
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a good question.

148
00:12:10,067 --> 00:12:11,268
[SPEAKER_09]: I can certainly find that out.

149
00:12:11,288 --> 00:12:12,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

150
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:20,698
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I realize, of course, we have no idea how long we'll have the high school, but I wouldn't want to pay for a 50-year piece of equipment if there's a 20-year option.

151
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:24,662
[SPEAKER_04]: And then do you happen to...

152
00:12:25,977 --> 00:12:32,939
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I mean, you might've been in school at the point when it was purchased, but do you have any idea how old the one that died was?

153
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the original one?

154
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:34,880
[SPEAKER_04]: When it was built?

155
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, it was the original equipment in the building.

156
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, that's all my questions.

157
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:44,744
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ms.

158
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Van de Kool, did you have any questions?

159
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:47,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I didn't miss your hand.

160
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:50,106
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me see, are you muted?

161
00:12:53,207 --> 00:12:54,127
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't hear you, Paulette.

162
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:57,082
[SPEAKER_02]: can you unmute?

163
00:12:58,843 --> 00:12:59,203
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

164
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:01,565
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor has her hand up.

165
00:13:02,065 --> 00:13:02,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

166
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:03,887
[SPEAKER_06]: And there we go.

167
00:13:03,987 --> 00:13:05,068
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you'd let her go first.

168
00:13:05,408 --> 00:13:05,568
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

169
00:13:06,069 --> 00:13:06,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Just just a quick.

170
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:07,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

171
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:07,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

172
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

173
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:10,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick question.

174
00:13:10,032 --> 00:13:11,793
[SPEAKER_01]: The to refresh my memory that

175
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:26,982
[SPEAKER_09]: 325 covered the generator, the bathrooms, and then some... Yeah, there was a shade project that we did at the high school, replaced all the shades and C building, as well as we made some repairs to the public address system up there as well.

176
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:28,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

177
00:13:29,244 --> 00:13:31,546
[SPEAKER_06]: So just, Kathy, may I?

178
00:13:32,046 --> 00:13:32,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you may.

179
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:33,487
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, go ahead.

180
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:40,373
[SPEAKER_06]: To be clear then, is the money for this generator, has it already been appropriated or has it not been appropriated?

181
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:48,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there hasn't been enough allocated for it because at the time we were kind of scrambling.

182
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:52,413
[SPEAKER_09]: And the only quote that we had was a $60,000 quote.

183
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,597
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was just for the generator, that's it.

184
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:06,606
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now, while this generator has not been operationable, we're just running off of one generator?

185
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,628
[SPEAKER_06]: The other generator is what I understand?

186
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:20,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if we lost power up in the high school area, what would happen is the back half of the building would have generator service, and the front half wouldn't, which would mean that

187
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:24,758
[SPEAKER_09]: the heat pumps wouldn't be running, the emergency lighting wouldn't be running.

188
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:31,360
[SPEAKER_09]: It's certainly a high priority items, especially on my list for sure.

189
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:40,763
[SPEAKER_09]: And luckily we've been, hopefully we've got through the winter, which is always the main concern.

190
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:47,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause if we did have anything happen for a few days, then I would be very concerned without having the heat pumps running.

191
00:14:49,887 --> 00:15:00,115
[SPEAKER_06]: John, the other day when I went up to attend the Haitian dance class, which was really fun, it was so hot in the gym.

192
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:06,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that have something to do with the generator or that's just a completely different issue?

193
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:17,432
[SPEAKER_09]: has to do with everything's working at Mefford High School right now, and with failing heat in certain places that we probably haven't for quite some time.

194
00:15:18,912 --> 00:15:25,335
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm certainly working on, we're coming to the end of the year, so we do have to slow down with a lot of what we're doing.

195
00:15:25,855 --> 00:15:33,699
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was gonna have, at some point, our HVAC guy come back and add some valves to the units, especially in the gym,

196
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:37,060
[SPEAKER_09]: so that we could keep the air flowing and shut the heat off.

197
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, everything runs off a main steam line that goes into that area.

198
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:53,525
[SPEAKER_09]: So in order to slow the heat down over there, we'd have to kind of cut the whole steam line because the pneumatics are short and the thermostats don't work.

199
00:15:53,885 --> 00:16:00,767
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was going to have them install a valve that we could turn on and off, or maybe even open it just to crack to get a little bit in there.

200
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,128
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was that was going to be the plan.

201
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:14,032
[SPEAKER_09]: But like I said, right now, we, you know, we've been, you know, I'm very grateful that we've done been able to get so much work done this past year.

202
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:19,674
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, there's always going to be, as everybody knows, there'll always be something happening and something to do.

203
00:16:19,774 --> 00:16:26,256
[SPEAKER_09]: So it didn't it wasn't certainly an emergency to get our kids back or get our teachers back to school.

204
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:27,197
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's something that

205
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:29,678
[SPEAKER_09]: we can get to eventually.

206
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:30,759
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a luxury, really.

207
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:31,740
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a luxury item.

208
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,823
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, but the generator, and Kathy, there was actually two bills.

209
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,804
[SPEAKER_06]: There were two different bills.

210
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:44,468
[SPEAKER_06]: One was for about 120 something, and the other one was for about 58, if I recall, that you sent out to us.

211
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:49,431
[SPEAKER_06]: So is it the combination of those two bills that you're saying we need?

212
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:53,293
[SPEAKER_06]: So 180, roughly.

213
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:54,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I thought it was 150.

214
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:59,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Somehow 158,000 stuck in my head, but yeah, you're probably better off.

215
00:17:00,035 --> 00:17:02,956
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's 128 plus 58, I think, right, Kathy?

216
00:17:02,976 --> 00:17:03,236
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

217
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:05,577
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, so we're talking, you know, 130 plus 60.

218
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:06,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

219
00:17:06,377 --> 00:17:07,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost 200K.

220
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:07,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

221
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:08,298
[SPEAKER_06]: In a budget which is going to be tight.

222
00:17:21,671 --> 00:17:24,933
[SPEAKER_06]: And now am I hearing that this is an emergency?

223
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:29,216
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, to get through next year, is that what?

224
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:31,797
[SPEAKER_09]: If anything was right now, yes, it is.

225
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Was this in our former capital plan?

226
00:17:37,645 --> 00:17:42,146
[SPEAKER_09]: It came up about a year and a half ago, whenever it was.

227
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:52,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that the mayor was serving on the council at the time when they appropriated the 325,000 for some capital improvements.

228
00:17:54,228 --> 00:18:04,110
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and that's when we started to get the ball rolling with the bathroom project and some of the other projects that were near and dear at that point, but it was known then.

229
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,722
[SPEAKER_06]: But what you're saying is we need to come up with roughly 200K to get this generator.

230
00:18:12,582 --> 00:18:17,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, yeah, or we could certainly, I mean, you can always get a second opinion.

231
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:23,887
[SPEAKER_09]: I assume the amount of money that we're requesting is gonna have to have a formal RFP.

232
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:26,808
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's Dave, Dave wants to talk, Dave Murphy.

233
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Griffey, go ahead.

234
00:18:32,202 --> 00:18:32,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

235
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:33,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, John.

236
00:18:34,264 --> 00:18:41,168
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've met with the procurement officials with the city within the last week, myself and Ms.

237
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:48,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingman in preparation for the likelihood of RFPs needing to be issued for these projects and a few others.

238
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:56,378
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there will be a need to go through a formal bidding process for these repairs.

239
00:18:56,953 --> 00:19:12,402
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to the budget allocations, what we have currently is an amount of money that has been allocated to the school department without specifically being earmarked for specific projects.

240
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:18,726
[SPEAKER_00]: With the first amount of money that John was referring to, which there's about $160,000 remaining, that has a fairly broad potential scope

241
00:19:25,987 --> 00:19:27,989
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the, it was the intercom.

242
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:30,210
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some instructional technology pieces to it.

243
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,552
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were the shades and then the restrooms.

244
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:43,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So taken together, it will not be a sufficient amount of funding to do all of those, but those are the priorities that we'll be speaking to the committee about in the coming weeks.

245
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:51,544
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, there's the funding that I believe was referenced at our last full school committee meeting in the vicinity of $800,000.

246
00:19:53,387 --> 00:20:06,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are about infrastructure projects that were appropriated on the basis that we assumed we were going to need that funding to take care of some of the COVID-related expenses.

247
00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:22,052
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the definition evolved with regard to what was ineligible expense under the federal funding, we've been able to maintain and essentially keep intact that amount of money with the understanding that we need to develop these priorities and then put some of that funding toward

248
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:43,074
[SPEAKER_00]: either some of the urgent infrastructure needs that Mr. McLaughlin is referring to here, the restroom projects that I know have been a priority for the committee and for the city for some time, and then a few other infrastructure related projects that are referenced in the capital plan that was just presented on a few days ago.

249
00:20:43,194 --> 00:20:49,839
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have some funding available and it's really just the question of

250
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:57,095
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying the most urgent priorities and then see what we have the capacity to address in the near term.

251
00:20:57,455 --> 00:21:18,651
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that I think that something like the generator should be viewed as a capital expense and not one that would ultimately be part of the operating budget, because whether it's 20 years, 30 years, or 40 years, it's not a reoccurring expense that would typically be something that we would consider to be an eligible expense with regard to our normal

252
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,434
[SPEAKER_00]: Operating education, educational operating budget.

253
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:33,643
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of decisions that are going to need to be made in the coming weeks as to how all of these different priorities will fit into the budgetary capacity we have on the capital side.

254
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:43,230
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you'll see that it'll be consistent with the present the recommendations that the administration brings forth to the committee will be consistent with those that have been identified as part of the capital plan.

255
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,493
[SPEAKER_00]: And these sort of emergency more urgent matters that

256
00:21:48,865 --> 00:21:50,486
[SPEAKER_00]: the generator would certainly be a part of.

257
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:53,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

258
00:21:53,587 --> 00:21:54,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Russo, I saw your hand.

259
00:21:54,668 --> 00:21:54,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

260
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:57,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

261
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:12,176
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. McLaughlin, you made a reference to something that I sort of interpret as a, you know, I don't want to say doomsday scenario, but if we lose power in the middle of a cold snap and we don't get it back for three days, all the pipes are bursting.

262
00:22:13,596 --> 00:22:17,098
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at a massive expense if we can't get heat

263
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:19,285
[SPEAKER_04]: in that area, correct?

264
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:21,006
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be correct, yes.

265
00:22:21,786 --> 00:22:34,548
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just think it's important to note that while we are going to have to struggle with priorities, I don't want us to put the city in a situation where we are going to come back and say, you know that $128,000 we needed?

266
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:40,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now we need $2 million or whatever it is to make the place functional again.

267
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to pretend nothing like that can happen.

268
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,631
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe it has never happened in our school.

269
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:55,838
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, if there's anything we've learned in the last 12 months is everything we imagined couldn't happen has an awful lot of those things have happened.

270
00:22:55,958 --> 00:23:11,041
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just think it's important to recognize that no matter, frankly, no matter what the cost is, having a way to prevent, frankly, a huge increased, a huge emergency cost has to be included in that.

271
00:23:11,881 --> 00:23:15,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I also did just note we did, this is in our May 18th of 2020 budget book

272
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,616
[SPEAKER_04]: this particular item.

273
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:26,359
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see that we have made progress in identifying what it is we need to do.

274
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:36,564
[SPEAKER_04]: I just am a little concerned that 10 months, granted we've had a pandemic going on, but 10 months seems like a long time to not even have an RFP ready to go.

275
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:40,426
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just wondering what is the timeline?

276
00:23:40,526 --> 00:23:47,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Because by the time this winter gets here, for this coming winter gets here, I don't wanna

277
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:51,323
[SPEAKER_04]: have a conversation about why we need to get a new generator.

278
00:23:51,363 --> 00:23:52,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know that it's there.

279
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:02,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Murphy, go ahead.

280
00:24:02,405 --> 00:24:04,146
[SPEAKER_00]: I just would agree with Mr. Rousseau's point.

281
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:09,067
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly our expectation that this is something that's addressed in the coming months in the spring or the summertime.

282
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:12,908
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't expect to go through another winter with the generator not functioning.

283
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:17,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And Dr. Maurice, yes, please.

284
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:37,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I just was going to actually echo those sentiments that it definitely was the unexpected turn of events with the pandemic last year with this permanent shutdown in March and not knowing what was going to happen and just remembering it seems like it was a century ago.

285
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:51,050
[SPEAKER_05]: were adding HEPA filters and just focusing on getting the air quality up and running for the buildings, that that's what ended up being our priority for the fall.

286
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,992
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that we're coming into the spring, this definitely is a priority for us.

287
00:24:57,794 --> 00:25:05,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's on our radar and we will work with that before going into another winter season.

288
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:07,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

289
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:31,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so is you know, I I was thinking of making a motion to you know, have this you know added As for discussion as a high priority item at the upcoming capital improvement plan meeting To be shared with the other committee members so that you know when we're meeting we can You know because we're meeting to make the priorities.

290
00:25:31,385 --> 00:25:34,106
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we going to use that capital money for?

291
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:38,347
[SPEAKER_02]: um You know is I think that's something that we should do

292
00:25:39,547 --> 00:25:45,931
[SPEAKER_02]: at this point is to have it added as a high priority item at the upcoming meeting.

293
00:25:47,572 --> 00:25:48,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I would second that motion.

294
00:25:48,792 --> 00:25:50,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

295
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:52,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call vote.

296
00:25:54,295 --> 00:25:55,796
[SPEAKER_06]: On that motion, Paul Rousseau?

299
00:25:59,318 --> 00:25:59,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

300
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:00,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Kathy Kreatz?

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_02]: Three in favor and zero opposed.

303
00:26:08,892 --> 00:26:09,713
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion passes.

304
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:13,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let me just do this.

305
00:26:13,396 --> 00:26:14,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Chairwoman, go.

306
00:26:15,077 --> 00:26:15,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, go ahead, Mayor.

307
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:17,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Chairwoman Kreatz, yes, thank you.

308
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:21,122
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to run to the meeting, the listening session on dyslexia.

309
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:30,749
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let them all know that the three of you are presently in a building and grounds subcommittee meeting, but I just wanted to go on the record, obviously in support of what the admin believes

310
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:42,669
[SPEAKER_01]: necessary for improvements to our buildings, school buildings, but also advocate for, you know, the potential ADA accessibility improvements to the front entrance of the high school.

311
00:26:43,229 --> 00:26:59,795
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's not an emergency, but just to add a little landscaping and a sign to welcome our ninth through 12th grade for the 2021-2022 school year would just go a really long way for all the children have been through all the,

312
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:09,987
[SPEAKER_01]: to go into a building with a new sign and just a freshly updated front entrance where the ADA accessibility does need to be improved there and worked on.

313
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:15,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to go on record saying that before I left, but thank you for chairing the meeting.

314
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:18,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

315
00:27:18,311 --> 00:27:19,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much mayor for attending.

316
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:20,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.

317
00:27:20,814 --> 00:27:22,215
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really appreciate everything.

318
00:27:22,235 --> 00:27:23,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

319
00:27:23,696 --> 00:27:27,139
[SPEAKER_02]: And tell the other members of the other committee, good luck with your meeting.

320
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:27,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

321
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:28,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

322
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everybody.

323
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:42,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we're moving on to the next agenda item, which is the Medford High School front entrance, which I kind of have it broken down into just different little sections.

324
00:27:43,525 --> 00:27:48,408
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to talk about the front entrance, the ramp, making that ADA compliant.

325
00:27:48,548 --> 00:27:56,092
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also going to talk about the front entrance, the sign that we were just talking about, and beautification, some landscaping.

326
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:58,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll start with

327
00:27:59,454 --> 00:28:16,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we left off was we met about the front entrance in November, and at this meeting we are revisiting the front end discussion, and I know how very busy, Mr. McLaughlin was after our last subcommittee meeting, getting all the costumes ready to welcome all the students back in January.

328
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand we didn't really get to do much between November and now so we're meeting again.

329
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:30,333
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to be talking about some of the same things as the mayor just mentioned she's very interested in fixing the ramp in the front end just a method high school.

330
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:34,818
[SPEAKER_02]: We understand that there's going to be a vision committee put in place.

331
00:28:34,918 --> 00:28:48,669
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the ramp in the front high school is not ADA compliant, and it needs to be fixed and it's unsafe to wait, you know, the five or so many years until we get that renovation plan, we need to make those changes now.

332
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,452
[SPEAKER_02]: So currently it's utility ramp.

333
00:28:52,172 --> 00:28:57,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's, you know, listed in the capital improvement plan for the draft for the city.

334
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:02,643
[SPEAKER_02]: There's ADA accessibility upgrades that are part of that plan.

335
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:08,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can, you know, potentially use the free cash to fix that entrance and.

336
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:16,864
[SPEAKER_02]: We, and just to give a little background, we had Mr. Kless Anderson, who's also on the call today, and we had Ms.

337
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:26,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Carolyn Montello, and she's also on the call today, and both those parents were very, they were very involved in the process, providing feedback.

338
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:34,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Kless Anderson is an architect, and he provided us with a design plan and great ideas.

339
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:34,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

340
00:29:34,593 --> 00:29:37,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Montello, she had wonderful ideas, and

341
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:39,696
[SPEAKER_02]: So we shared that at the last meeting.

342
00:29:39,836 --> 00:29:45,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I can screen share, if anybody wants to see it, that design plan again.

343
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:46,841
[SPEAKER_02]: Just let me know.

344
00:29:46,861 --> 00:29:50,524
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it saved on my computer, just if you want to get another look at it.

345
00:29:51,705 --> 00:29:53,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe, did I email it to everybody?

346
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:55,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember if I did.

347
00:29:55,708 --> 00:29:57,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Not this time around, but last time.

348
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:58,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Not this time around.

349
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

350
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want me to do a quick screen share of just the front entrance?

351
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:20,594
[SPEAKER_02]: sure okay so let me open it up one moment i'll open it up first um sorry don't mind i'm just looking around i put it on my desktop to get there i have too many things open okay front entrance design okay hold on

352
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:25,936
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, now let me go back to the meeting.

353
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:28,158
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, let's see.

354
00:30:28,698 --> 00:30:31,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm not really good at the screen sharing.

355
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:37,784
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the screen, and now I'm trying to get back to Zoom.

356
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:38,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, OK, one minute.

357
00:30:39,265 --> 00:30:40,786
[SPEAKER_02]: It shrunk down, my Zoom.

358
00:30:41,186 --> 00:30:42,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there we go.

359
00:30:42,547 --> 00:30:43,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Maximize, OK.

360
00:30:43,648 --> 00:30:45,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK, so now I have the Zoom back, screen share.

361
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:48,451
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, screen, let me see if that.

362
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:50,272
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, click on it.

363
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:51,793
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, can you see it?

364
00:30:53,115 --> 00:30:53,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

365
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:54,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, there.

366
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:54,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

367
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:55,276
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I did it.

368
00:30:56,216 --> 00:30:57,417
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the first time I've done it.

369
00:30:57,437 --> 00:30:59,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm serious.

370
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:00,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so there it is.

371
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:03,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just an absolutely beautiful design.

372
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,042
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I did, you know, get in touch with Mr. Andreessen, you know, when we spoke.

373
00:31:10,642 --> 00:31:12,543
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have him on the call today.

374
00:31:12,563 --> 00:31:27,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have Mr. McLaughlin, you know, we communicated about this and I told him, you know, what the plans are is, you know, that, you know, we understand that there's gonna be a lot of different projects and we can't do everything at once.

375
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:32,317
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so we have the ramp and then we have the brick work and then there's the renovation.

376
00:31:32,397 --> 00:31:35,760
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is gonna be like a phase project where

377
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:49,604
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe the first phase will be the ramp, making it ADA compliant, getting a nice sign for the front of the school, and doing some landscaping at the front entrance, and then maybe at the bottom at the driveway area.

378
00:31:50,685 --> 00:32:00,187
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll let Mr. McLaughlin have a few words to say, and then Mr. Andreessen, if you would like to also say some things, please do.

379
00:32:01,368 --> 00:32:01,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

380
00:32:12,022 --> 00:32:14,383
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Koretz, are you able to stop screen share?

381
00:32:14,723 --> 00:32:16,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to do that right now.

382
00:32:16,363 --> 00:32:21,605
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what happened is I have a mini Zoom.

383
00:32:21,965 --> 00:32:23,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm afraid I'm going to click out of it.

384
00:32:23,846 --> 00:32:32,369
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how it happened, but I actually have a little panel of Zoom, but I don't have the, shoot, let me see here.

385
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:33,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go here.

386
00:32:33,515 --> 00:32:34,296
[SPEAKER_06]: HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): So Kathy.

387
00:32:34,677 --> 00:32:34,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

388
00:32:35,258 --> 00:32:39,003
[SPEAKER_06]: While you work on that one of the questions you had up is an important one.

389
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:44,391
[SPEAKER_06]: HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): And HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): ADA compliant.

390
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:47,536
[SPEAKER_06]: HAB-Masyn Moyer-Moyer): Can can vehicle still drive on it.

391
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:47,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

392
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:48,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

393
00:32:48,737 --> 00:33:08,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have that question you got to see it too yes so that is a question that I did have you know and I that's one of my questions I had if we were to convert that ramp to an ADA compliant ramp would vehicles be able to drive on it I know that the um the ban uses that ramp and I think that ramp might be used for

394
00:33:09,002 --> 00:33:13,267
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe things being delivered to the school in the front entrance that way.

395
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:15,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

396
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:19,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be a question maybe for Mr. McLaughlin.

397
00:33:19,074 --> 00:33:20,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know the interest of that?

398
00:33:20,095 --> 00:33:26,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if we were to convert a utility ramp into an ADA ramp, would it be vehicle?

399
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:35,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I would make it wide enough so that you could back vehicles on it.

400
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:43,176
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would obviously, I would check with our contract to make sure that we're able to do that as well.

401
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:46,997
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, the plows do go up there as well.

402
00:33:47,477 --> 00:33:55,700
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I would keep the ramp, maybe make it a little bit wider than it is now so that in case we decided that, you know,

403
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,600
[SPEAKER_09]: we wanted to put some walls on either side.

404
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:05,582
[SPEAKER_09]: However, the committee or the superintendent wants to push forward with it.

405
00:34:05,642 --> 00:34:07,262
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, definitely.

406
00:34:09,302 --> 00:34:10,202
[SPEAKER_06]: So Kathy Mayer?

407
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:11,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you may.

408
00:34:11,263 --> 00:34:11,643
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Ms.

409
00:34:11,663 --> 00:34:12,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Van der Kloot.

410
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:19,864
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know that for ADA, it's, I think if I recall, it's one inch per foot or something like that.

411
00:34:19,904 --> 00:34:23,825
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a very prescribed amount that the rise happens.

412
00:34:23,885 --> 00:34:25,585
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very gradual rise.

413
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:39,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there enough room to, and if you think about, you know, the actual ramp that's there, you know, it goes back and forth in order to accommodate that very gentle slope.

414
00:34:40,529 --> 00:34:49,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking at the front of the school at the ramp that we're talking about, which I express great concerns about the safety of on many occasions,

415
00:34:50,274 --> 00:34:53,639
[SPEAKER_06]: But is there enough rise to make it into an ADA?

416
00:34:53,860 --> 00:35:00,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there enough room to create the rise, that gentle slope to make it into ADA compliant?

417
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I would, I would.

418
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:11,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I can take this one if you like.

419
00:35:11,202 --> 00:35:13,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. McLaughlin, I think you froze.

420
00:35:14,084 --> 00:35:15,044
[SPEAKER_02]: You froze for a little bit.

421
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:16,945
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't hear what you said, sorry.

422
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:20,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Mr. Andreessen would like to maybe try to answer that question.

423
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:23,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Mr. Andreessen.

424
00:35:25,411 --> 00:35:27,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so can you hear me?

425
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:28,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can.

426
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:29,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

427
00:35:30,013 --> 00:35:37,438
[SPEAKER_03]: In the diagrams that you just showed, there's a drawing in there that shows what

428
00:35:39,247 --> 00:35:43,809
[SPEAKER_03]: the space requirements would be for an accessible one to 20 ramp.

429
00:35:46,131 --> 00:35:53,094
[SPEAKER_03]: And I described this last time, but if you do a one in 12 ramp, handrails are required.

430
00:35:53,654 --> 00:36:02,659
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do a one in 20 ramp, it's technically then becomes a sloped floor or sloped grade and you don't need handrails.

431
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,241
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's plenty of room for either.

432
00:36:07,101 --> 00:36:07,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

433
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:12,291
[SPEAKER_02]: That's excellent, thank you.

434
00:36:14,133 --> 00:36:15,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions on that?

435
00:36:21,183 --> 00:36:28,053
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other question I had was, I know at our last meeting

436
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:33,097
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we wanted to know if you'd be able to approach a site contractor or Mason.

437
00:36:34,438 --> 00:36:37,120
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that it was just very busy times.

438
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,341
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to get the schools open up to get the kids back in for the high school.

439
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,643
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that we didn't get to do that.

440
00:36:43,503 --> 00:36:52,228
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, as part of this process, we do need an estimate to go to the next step.

441
00:36:52,888 --> 00:37:12,498
[SPEAKER_02]: which is to, you know, you know, cause as part of the capital improvement meeting that we have coming up on the 22nd, we'll need some sort of an estimate to bring forth to the other committee members so that they have the, you know, all the figures that, you know, we have to add up to, you know, that free cash amount of the $816,000, you know, or so.

442
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:33,905
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering, John, would it be possible, because I was thinking of making a motion to get an estimate for the front entrance to make that ramp ADA compliant to get that estimate on or before that capital improvement plan meeting on the 22nd?

443
00:37:34,866 --> 00:37:43,351
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I can obtain a quote that quickly because myself personally, I'm a little bit, I'm not exactly sure

444
00:37:44,759 --> 00:37:47,881
[SPEAKER_09]: what the scope or the actual scope of the work is.

445
00:37:48,421 --> 00:37:55,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we were to put that handicap ramp in or fix that ramp and make it handicap accessible.

446
00:37:55,844 --> 00:37:59,646
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem is that nothing else around that area is.

447
00:37:59,726 --> 00:38:03,428
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a ramp over by where the TV studio is.

448
00:38:03,888 --> 00:38:04,969
[SPEAKER_09]: So where do you go?

449
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:07,270
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you continue to go down to the driveway?

450
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:16,522
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when you get into the driveway there's two handicapped spots there that are definitely not ADA accessible the ramps are definitely not slow properly.

451
00:38:17,343 --> 00:38:23,351
[SPEAKER_09]: And about a year ago I think was a year ago I want to say that myself and the superintendent.

452
00:38:24,452 --> 00:38:44,923
[SPEAKER_09]: we had a brief meeting with the traffic commissioner and you know do we remove those two handicap spots that are there that are uncompliant and put them somewhere that is compliant you know because you're gonna have to make curb cuts in the front on in that in the go around in the front of the building in order you don't even need to make that to make that break.

453
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:59,202
[SPEAKER_09]: But without having to have a little ramp near the TV studio and across the way to the front door, because you can go up with there's a ramp right at the TV studio that you can go up and then you can go across the walkway to the front door as well.

454
00:38:59,742 --> 00:39:02,566
[SPEAKER_09]: But so those are the type of questions that you know.

455
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:07,349
[SPEAKER_09]: that we should talk about, like as far as what are we actually gonna do?

456
00:39:07,409 --> 00:39:12,431
[SPEAKER_09]: So if I bring a contractor and I say, all right, this is what we're actually gonna do.

457
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:21,195
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna fix this ramp, fix these stairs, fix the curbing, put a handicap curbing place in.

458
00:39:21,475 --> 00:39:27,278
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just have to have a really good understanding of what we actually want to do.

459
00:39:30,139 --> 00:39:31,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Mr. Andreessen, please.

460
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:45,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I completely agree with Mr. McLaughlin that this project, even though it's seemingly a small ramp, would probably require review from both the structural and civil engineer.

461
00:39:47,568 --> 00:39:56,353
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would need to do a set of drawings for this for him to get a realistic quote.

462
00:39:58,994 --> 00:39:59,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Cha-ching, cha-ching.

463
00:40:01,956 --> 00:40:02,276
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.

464
00:40:11,218 --> 00:40:11,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathy?

465
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:13,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, okay, Mr. Russo, go ahead.

466
00:40:15,402 --> 00:40:15,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

467
00:40:18,364 --> 00:40:26,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this just adds cost and expands the project, but universal design would perhaps make more sense.

468
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:33,437
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure all the kids that can use the stairs could also use a ramp without it being too much of a challenge for them.

469
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,880
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a joke, not really funny, sorry.

470
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but, um, you know, where we are, I'm just a little concerned about.

471
00:40:41,912 --> 00:40:50,317
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I suppose even today, you know, like, Hey, if you need to use the ramp, you can, you can walk the half a mile extra.

472
00:40:51,437 --> 00:40:57,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and, um, and I suppose this is perhaps a vision committee conversation more than anything.

473
00:40:57,761 --> 00:41:02,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but you know, having a, taking a universal design perspective helps everybody.

474
00:41:03,123 --> 00:41:06,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I, I don't believe that there are people that use stairs that.

475
00:41:06,572 --> 00:41:07,674
[SPEAKER_04]: would struggle with a ramp.

476
00:41:07,714 --> 00:41:09,256
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's a real thing.

477
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:22,514
[SPEAKER_04]: But it probably does require much more of a whole front end thought rather than using essentially the configuration we already have.

478
00:41:23,892 --> 00:41:24,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know why I'm talking.

479
00:41:24,913 --> 00:41:26,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just wanna drag the meeting out, sorry.

480
00:41:28,476 --> 00:41:28,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

481
00:41:30,638 --> 00:41:34,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm still thinking on this.

482
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:48,613
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we had a goal and our goal was to make that front entrance ramp, an ADA compliance ramp, and we had to put together a plan in this committee,

483
00:41:50,706 --> 00:42:10,567
[SPEAKER_02]: What would we need to decide like do we need to decide that one, we need that curb cut out so that you know coming from the parking lot over to the front entrance there's going to be the curb cut out so that the person can go straight across and go up, you know, up the front entrance up the ramp.

484
00:42:11,826 --> 00:42:22,189
[SPEAKER_02]: In and I know that it would you know, it would require, you know costs and fees Is there any way to get an estimate on?

485
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:38,373
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that if we had a plan that you know, because definitely You know, it's one of the issue, you know, one of the things that we do want to get fixed is You know making that ramp ada compliant and

486
00:42:39,364 --> 00:42:51,089
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think, you know, we had a discussion about it in November and we're discussing it again, but I kind of want to try to move it along to the next level, which is going to the next step.

487
00:42:51,889 --> 00:42:55,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just trying to think the next step would be coming up with a plan.

488
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,771
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we actually want?

489
00:42:57,331 --> 00:43:07,375
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think what I'm hearing is that we do actually want to have the whole, you know, the parking spaces, the curb cutout,

490
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:16,188
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, both coming from the parking lot and then over to the curbing, and then the handicap ramp, you know, getting that done.

491
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:21,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And, or am I just kind of going off too far.

492
00:43:22,491 --> 00:43:25,132
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody want to chime in any committee members or anybody.

493
00:43:28,656 --> 00:43:37,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I can I can just say that, you know, have, you know, obviously, needing to plan at this particular point in time there is a handicap ramp.

494
00:43:38,162 --> 00:43:40,664
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not at the exact front door of the building.

495
00:43:41,044 --> 00:43:43,826
[SPEAKER_09]: There's curb cuts, there's a couple of parking spots.

496
00:43:44,286 --> 00:43:46,027
[SPEAKER_09]: very close to the handicap ramp.

497
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:52,389
[SPEAKER_09]: So just so it was at home, understand that, you know, we're not out of compliance.

498
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:56,351
[SPEAKER_09]: We were just gonna open up the compliance to more spaces.

499
00:43:56,771 --> 00:44:11,117
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, we had the traffic engineer and I believe at this point in time that we do have more than the recommended amount of handicapped and parking and up there at the high school, but there, you know, there are some,

500
00:44:12,798 --> 00:44:15,219
[SPEAKER_09]: There's two parking spots at the very front.

501
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:23,385
[SPEAKER_09]: If you walk out the front door and you walk straight down across, there's two parking spots designated right there as handicapped parking.

502
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:30,610
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no curb cutouts and the ramp is definitely not a 2% grade ramp.

503
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who put them there.

504
00:44:33,412 --> 00:44:41,482
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't during my tenure, but they should, you know, and, and again, like I stressed earlier that myself and the superintendent.

505
00:44:42,162 --> 00:44:49,731
[SPEAKER_09]: We definitely met with the traffic commissioner to try to iron out some of these issues, so that we can you know so that we could.

506
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:55,541
[SPEAKER_09]: take care, you know, we wanna be accessible in the proper way.

507
00:44:55,881 --> 00:45:02,822
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would hate for a van to pull up down front, get out in a wheelchair, and then see that there's no way that they can get into the building.

508
00:45:03,722 --> 00:45:07,983
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's something that's, you know, it's important to look into it.

509
00:45:08,003 --> 00:45:08,523
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?

510
00:45:08,983 --> 00:45:13,444
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, and we just got, like you said, Kathy, you know, phasing it out.

511
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:14,564
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, what do you want?

512
00:45:14,604 --> 00:45:17,805
[SPEAKER_09]: You want the front half done first and some landscaping assigned?

513
00:45:18,125 --> 00:45:19,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we did have, you know,

514
00:45:20,563 --> 00:45:22,385
[SPEAKER_09]: we're neglecting the brick project too.

515
00:45:22,985 --> 00:45:29,931
[SPEAKER_09]: And the brick project that was in the works that made the works anymore.

516
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:41,380
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a lot of stuff happening as far as that goes, you know what I mean?

517
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,521
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think somebody's ringing on it.

518
00:45:43,561 --> 00:45:44,542
[SPEAKER_09]: I can hear a noise.

519
00:45:44,582 --> 00:45:46,083
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like a cash register.

520
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:53,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the background, kind of caching in here because, you know, every, every time we talk, the price goes up.

521
00:45:57,351 --> 00:45:57,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

522
00:45:58,132 --> 00:46:00,154
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Kathy.

523
00:46:00,835 --> 00:46:03,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Mr. Antiquity just wants to chime in.

524
00:46:03,598 --> 00:46:04,038
[SPEAKER_06]: She said.

525
00:46:06,352 --> 00:46:07,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind at all.

526
00:46:07,293 --> 00:46:08,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I have four dogs.

527
00:46:08,494 --> 00:46:18,981
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, the concern I have is, you know, as soon as we start just the discussion around the ADA compliance, it does get very expensive.

528
00:46:19,642 --> 00:46:25,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And the question now is, you know, again, that vision committee hasn't gotten off the ground yet.

529
00:46:26,347 --> 00:46:27,687
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, how much money

530
00:46:28,725 --> 00:46:34,467
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to, we all agree that some level of upgrade would be nice just to make it look better right away.

531
00:46:36,987 --> 00:46:46,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I've brought a safety concern with the current configuration saying, look, do we put a handrail in?

532
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Can a truck still use it?

533
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:55,173
[SPEAKER_06]: But I understand it's not ADA compliant, that particular ramp, but we've always used the other ramp

534
00:46:57,004 --> 00:47:02,245
[SPEAKER_06]: If, you know, right now, I think that there's a question of, I mean, we just have to be mindful of the money.

535
00:47:02,265 --> 00:47:08,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, there was another drawing you shared with us today, just with the Mustang and welcome Mustangs, whatever.

536
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:25,069
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, I'm really, of course, I would love it to be officially ADA compliant throughout every ramp, but I'm just wondering whether we really have the money to go down that route right now and how much money

537
00:47:26,208 --> 00:47:27,508
[SPEAKER_06]: do we want to invest?

538
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:31,369
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I loved Klaus's drawings.

539
00:47:31,529 --> 00:47:32,749
[SPEAKER_06]: I absolutely loved them.

540
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:36,270
[SPEAKER_06]: And that obviously is, you know, just gets you excited.

541
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:40,531
[SPEAKER_06]: But there is a trade-off between how much we do.

542
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:49,573
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm kind of on the fence about that right now when I think about what financial picture we face in the very short term.

543
00:47:50,633 --> 00:47:52,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just jump in real quick?

544
00:47:52,094 --> 00:47:53,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please do, please.

545
00:47:56,902 --> 00:48:02,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Not making a recommendation, but given the information that Ms.

546
00:48:02,364 --> 00:48:09,206
[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot just said, for me, and I think if you were to speak to your lawyers, they would say the same thing.

547
00:48:09,726 --> 00:48:14,708
[SPEAKER_03]: You either leave the ramp exactly as it is today, or you replace it.

548
00:48:15,748 --> 00:48:21,530
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't do something in between, because that puts you into a really- Problem.

549
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:22,970
[SPEAKER_03]: A problem place.

550
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's either you do that project and you

551
00:48:26,053 --> 00:48:34,238
[SPEAKER_03]: embrace the cost, or you just completely ignore that ramp and just say, you know, that's been there 30 years.

552
00:48:35,919 --> 00:48:45,505
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll replace it when that happens, but interim steps with those kinds of accessible pieces is not a good idea.

553
00:48:47,866 --> 00:48:48,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

554
00:48:48,346 --> 00:48:48,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

555
00:48:50,620 --> 00:49:05,315
[SPEAKER_09]: And what we got to remember as well too, is that when you spend $150,000 within like a three or four year period, every renovation that you have to make has to be ADA compliant.

556
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:07,838
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the law.

557
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:14,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave has his hand up, Kathy.

558
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:19,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Murphy, sorry, I'm actually, yeah, please feel free to do that anytime, because I'm typing a little new.

559
00:49:19,232 --> 00:49:20,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay, go ahead, Mr. Murphy.

560
00:49:20,432 --> 00:49:20,832
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ms.

561
00:49:20,852 --> 00:49:21,452
[SPEAKER_00]: Kress, thank you, Ms.

562
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:21,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandenburg.

563
00:49:23,433 --> 00:49:39,737
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, to Paulette's point regarding the overall cost, first of all, I 100% agree with regard to we can't go halfway if there's a renovation, then the renovation has to comply with the modern standards, obviously.

564
00:49:41,121 --> 00:49:59,790
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in terms of the sort of strategic decision as to whether we have the capacity to do a front end renovation that will include both the aesthetic piece that folks have spoken to and the compliance piece that will be a necessity if we do that and is important to do in its own right.

565
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:08,194
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be best would be if we brought forth sort of a suite of recommendations that included

566
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:18,915
[SPEAKER_00]: the generator that we talked about in the first part of the conversation, the front entrance piece, and some of the other parts that we're going to be talking about, I suspect, in the next few minutes.

567
00:50:19,655 --> 00:50:31,442
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the committee can look at it in its entirety and say, based on the funding capacity that we have at the moment, these are the things that we should move forward on.

568
00:50:31,822 --> 00:50:37,885
[SPEAKER_00]: There may be a need to go back to the city council for some of these pieces to get authorization for

569
00:50:38,533 --> 00:50:50,202
[SPEAKER_00]: the broader scope on some parts of it, especially if they're being packaged together, I'd have to review the language as to exactly what the terms and conditions were when that funding was authorized.

570
00:50:50,262 --> 00:50:54,225
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I don't know whether or not that's necessary, but we should be prepared for that in case it is.

571
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:56,927
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say that, I think to Ms.

572
00:50:56,967 --> 00:51:06,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Van der Kloot's point, I don't think it would be ill-advised, I think, to make decisions in a vacuum because ultimately there's going to be a

573
00:51:07,187 --> 00:51:14,129
[SPEAKER_00]: financial capacity for capital related projects that at least at the moment is gonna stand at a certain number.

574
00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:20,332
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we may have to go back to get some revised definitions to make sure that we're on solid footing with regard to its actual use.

575
00:51:21,372 --> 00:51:29,015
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I think you can make a decision in terms of strategically here are the things that are really a necessity to avoid a catastrophe.

576
00:51:29,535 --> 00:51:33,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are things that we need to do because it's just a prudent best practice.

577
00:51:34,097 --> 00:51:35,097
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are things that we should do

578
00:51:35,557 --> 00:51:38,538
[SPEAKER_00]: either for a compliance or an aesthetic perspective.

579
00:51:38,558 --> 00:51:44,961
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we go from there and all of these things will require multiple RFPs and going through the bidding process and everything like that.

580
00:51:44,981 --> 00:51:48,222
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's important that those decisions be made with the full context.

581
00:51:50,322 --> 00:51:50,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Kathy?

582
00:51:51,003 --> 00:51:51,403
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Ms.

583
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Van De Koot.

584
00:51:52,143 --> 00:52:01,251
[SPEAKER_06]: There was another photo that you shared with us, and it had the picture of the horse and blue columns on the outside.

585
00:52:03,132 --> 00:52:08,496
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really a cosmetic upgrade.

586
00:52:09,057 --> 00:52:11,559
[SPEAKER_06]: I had seen that picture when you sent it to us.

587
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:20,702
[SPEAKER_06]: that did not look like that was part of a very large or structural.

588
00:52:20,802 --> 00:52:22,742
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't part of a structural upgrade.

589
00:52:22,762 --> 00:52:24,262
[SPEAKER_06]: It was part of a cosmetic upgrade.

590
00:52:25,623 --> 00:52:30,004
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wondered, that was the first time that I remember seeing that particular photo.

591
00:52:30,084 --> 00:52:34,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, don't remember that being as part of Klaus's, I'm not sure.

592
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:34,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So can you-

593
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:40,167
[SPEAKER_02]: No, so that photo that was the next as part of the front entrance.

594
00:52:40,587 --> 00:52:44,669
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what I was going to talk about next was last year.

595
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:46,850
[SPEAKER_02]: During the beautification.

596
00:52:47,651 --> 00:52:51,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Chris Christopher Donovan he's a parent community member and photographer.

597
00:52:52,493 --> 00:52:58,216
[SPEAKER_02]: He had shared that picture with us the day after the beautification day.

598
00:52:59,657 --> 00:53:11,582
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a photographer, so he did the Photoshop and he did the front entrance picture idea that he had for the front entrance that he shared with me.

599
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:21,207
[SPEAKER_02]: When we had originally seen it, it was discussed a while back before COVID shutdown that that would be a really nice idea.

600
00:53:21,627 --> 00:53:26,690
[SPEAKER_02]: for the 50th birthday celebration for the high school to get a new sign.

601
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:36,436
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, I had an idea, and I even talked to my son, because he was in robotics and automation engineering.

602
00:53:37,037 --> 00:53:48,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And I showed it to him, and he said that it's very possible that it's something that could be done easily with a laser cutter or plasma cutter, possibly.

603
00:53:48,264 --> 00:53:49,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Has everybody seen the photo?

604
00:53:50,905 --> 00:53:52,607
[SPEAKER_02]: What I can do is I can screen share it right now.

605
00:53:52,627 --> 00:53:54,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just so that you know what we're talking about.

606
00:53:54,768 --> 00:53:55,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.

607
00:53:55,348 --> 00:53:56,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me do that right now.

608
00:53:59,671 --> 00:54:02,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to just give everybody a friendly reminder.

609
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:07,817
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting close on the time, and it's getting up there.

610
00:54:07,837 --> 00:54:10,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to quickly move through some other things.

611
00:54:10,879 --> 00:54:11,640
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get there.

612
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to my desktop.

613
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:14,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yep.

614
00:54:14,602 --> 00:54:14,922
[SPEAKER_02]: One second.

615
00:54:14,982 --> 00:54:15,682
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on my desktop.

616
00:54:28,008 --> 00:54:28,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, here it is.

617
00:54:28,648 --> 00:54:32,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to open it up right now and go back to Zoom.

618
00:54:38,791 --> 00:54:40,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let me do screen share.

619
00:54:43,012 --> 00:54:43,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

620
00:54:44,892 --> 00:54:46,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so can everybody see that?

621
00:54:47,875 --> 00:54:48,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

622
00:54:48,475 --> 00:54:52,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is, like, this is just a very quick picture.

623
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:59,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just a, you know, I mean, this wouldn't be the final version, you know, if, you know, we were gonna choose something like that.

624
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:13,425
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did, you know, get in touch with Mr. Donovan and he's actually, he might be unavailable, you know, for this meeting, but, you know, he did do some estimates on his own.

625
00:55:14,165 --> 00:55:18,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I'm just looking at it a thousand dollars and landscaping up front would be new cool.

626
00:55:19,348 --> 00:55:22,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it would be nice if the vocational students could do it.

627
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:29,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we could maybe reach out to Mr. Fallon and ask him if he could inquire with the

628
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:32,936
[SPEAKER_02]: metal fab and the robotics and automation teachers.

629
00:55:32,976 --> 00:55:47,428
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is something that could be done, you know, via the two programs, I know that I, right before the shutdown, I got to see the robotics automation engineering, and they just have, they have the laser cutter, the plasma cutter, everything.

630
00:55:48,129 --> 00:55:50,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Mr. Cushing, go ahead.

631
00:55:52,993 --> 00:55:54,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, I can't hear you, I'm sorry.

632
00:55:54,914 --> 00:55:57,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna stop the screen share.

633
00:55:59,164 --> 00:56:00,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let me see.

634
00:56:01,226 --> 00:56:02,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you wanna go ahead, Mr. Cush?

635
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:04,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there you go.

636
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:09,111
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that looks absolutely wonderful and really great.

637
00:56:09,752 --> 00:56:26,504
[SPEAKER_08]: I worry that any investment when we're looking at a potential long-term project that may be taken apart, I have seen and have actually installed, but Groton-Dunstable High School has a massive crusader on the side of its building.

638
00:56:27,504 --> 00:56:28,445
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a mesh banner.

639
00:56:29,856 --> 00:56:32,639
[SPEAKER_08]: that you can do extremely cost effectively.

640
00:56:32,699 --> 00:56:35,482
[SPEAKER_08]: They can be as high as 17 feet high.

641
00:56:36,043 --> 00:56:37,985
[SPEAKER_08]: They can be extremely long.

642
00:56:38,205 --> 00:56:40,168
[SPEAKER_08]: They can look like unbelievable.

643
00:56:40,368 --> 00:56:42,630
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was thinking on the outside of the theater.

644
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:45,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that way you can say like,

645
00:56:46,310 --> 00:57:10,815
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, welcome classes, welcome whatever, and then it will serve the effect of beautifying the building while also looking at that, like, long-term, what's the integrated beautification project look like for that front piazza of the building, and while also respecting and understanding, like, as we move to beautify the front of the building,

646
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:19,472
[SPEAKER_08]: that this could be a temporary stopgap for a comprehensive long-term plan to be done.

647
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:28,735
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I was thinking as you drive up the driveway and you take that right-hand turn in, you've got basically this massive space

648
00:57:30,956 --> 00:57:32,437
[SPEAKER_08]: on the backside of the theater.

649
00:57:32,477 --> 00:57:35,498
[SPEAKER_08]: It's classrooms, but there are no windows.

650
00:57:36,518 --> 00:57:48,401
[SPEAKER_08]: It's completely concrete and would be able to do, it would be on the front of the building essentially as, you know, it's essentially right now just a blank concrete canvas.

651
00:57:48,921 --> 00:57:52,582
[SPEAKER_08]: And you could put up a large mesh banner that would run

652
00:57:53,391 --> 00:57:59,213
[SPEAKER_08]: the entire length, you could have a Mustang full size and full sprint.

653
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:11,116
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically your imagination runs the gamut for what could be done for not a lot of money that then could be preserved, could be moved, could be whatever.

654
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:22,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I just worry about us looking at like an integrated plan that's well thought out that in five years, we're not removing something that we spent money on.

655
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:24,961
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you.

656
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate that idea.

657
00:58:26,142 --> 00:58:27,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked that idea a lot.

658
00:58:27,882 --> 00:58:30,883
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the front of the building.

659
00:58:30,903 --> 00:58:32,003
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the front of the building.

660
00:58:32,363 --> 00:58:37,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, let me just screen share real quick just so if it'll work.

661
00:58:38,445 --> 00:58:42,366
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

662
00:58:42,546 --> 00:58:45,447
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm on Google Street View right now.

663
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:49,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about this area right here as you drive up.

664
00:58:50,529 --> 00:58:57,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, which would give as you're approaching the building a lot of kids come up, and they're dropped off at the West courtyard.

665
00:58:58,565 --> 00:59:12,027
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, and they come in that way from either student parking or from whatever it may be, buses, and then you've got a large section of the population that gets dropped off here as well.

666
00:59:12,547 --> 00:59:18,949
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you come up, it would be visible to both sections of students along this.

667
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:22,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I definitely wanna see something here.

668
00:59:22,189 --> 00:59:27,090
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, once again, I worry about, and I'm gonna stop my screen share real quick.

669
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:33,820
[SPEAKER_08]: so that I just worry about that, like whatever we invest that it's lasting.

670
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:41,145
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that also goes to what Paulette was saying around the vision committee and that integrated approach.

671
00:59:44,586 --> 00:59:48,469
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I really liked that idea and what do my committee members think?

672
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Maurice, go ahead.

673
00:59:52,431 --> 00:59:53,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Dr. Maurice and then Ms.

674
00:59:53,892 --> 00:59:54,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Van der Kloot.

675
00:59:55,202 --> 01:00:00,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think with the, the architecture and structure of the building where there is so much concrete.

676
01:00:03,241 --> 01:00:14,492
[SPEAKER_05]: facing that there definitely are opportunities to definitely add additional enhancements, even the area where Dr. Cushing was just talking about when you come up the hill.

677
01:00:15,733 --> 01:00:25,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I still know though, from just having been in the district for the three years that I've been there, people who are coming to the high school for the first time or are not familiar with it,

678
01:00:26,403 --> 01:00:29,626
[SPEAKER_05]: it's difficult to know where the front of the school is.

679
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:43,276
[SPEAKER_05]: So we end up saying, if you find the big tall flagpole and the island in the middle, but as people come up, sometimes they end up going straight to the West courtyard, or even if they're trying to find how to access the pools.

680
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:45,878
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do feel like,

681
01:00:47,797 --> 01:00:52,281
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever the wording could be, if we can work with our vocational students, which would be fabulous.

682
01:00:53,642 --> 01:01:06,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Donovan's picture where he had the lighting on the inside and just having something where people will know this is the official front door of the school.

683
01:01:06,772 --> 01:01:11,896
[SPEAKER_05]: I think to have some kind of a marker just to be able to say this is your front door,

684
01:01:12,797 --> 01:01:24,419
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the official main entrance where when you walk into that entrance, you're greeted by, you know, the security booth and, you know, they can send you upstairs, downstairs.

685
01:01:24,479 --> 01:01:30,941
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the official main entrance because people do try to come through other doors because they don't know.

686
01:01:31,001 --> 01:01:32,541
[SPEAKER_05]: They try to come through side doors.

687
01:01:33,401 --> 01:01:36,702
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I do feel as we think about

688
01:01:39,772 --> 01:01:59,626
[SPEAKER_05]: even though it would be for a short period of time, to add a little landscaping to the front of the high school, having clear signage, a bigger sign on the official front doors so people will know this is the main entrance, that would be my recommended priority.

689
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:20,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And we could definitely use the other sections where we have large amounts of just, you know, that cement canvas, concrete canvas to be able to say, you know, whether it's the mesh sign or if it's having Mustangs

690
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:22,561
[SPEAKER_05]: running toward the front door.

691
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:27,886
[SPEAKER_05]: So we could say, oh, when you see the horses running to the right, follow the horses.

692
01:02:28,446 --> 01:02:34,952
[SPEAKER_05]: And so instead of saying follow the arrow, people will follow the horses and say, okay, I'm making my way to the front door.

693
01:02:35,052 --> 01:02:45,482
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are a couple of ways we can try to be funny and play on the Mustang nation, but think of a way to use that blank canvas

694
01:02:46,473 --> 01:02:52,434
[SPEAKER_05]: and at the same time, point people in the direction of where the actual front door is.

695
01:02:53,054 --> 01:03:08,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, with paint, with additional lighting, with additional shrubbery, the building has the potential to look beautiful while we're waiting to figure out what needs to happen.

696
01:03:09,698 --> 01:03:13,899
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, maybe I've watched too much HGTV sometimes, but...

697
01:03:15,383 --> 01:03:19,426
[SPEAKER_05]: When you look at things and you just see, wow, all they did was paint it.

698
01:03:19,786 --> 01:03:31,834
[SPEAKER_05]: For those of you, believe it or not, it was a year ago, last February, I believe, when we did the beautification project in the front foyer, the lobby of the high school.

699
01:03:32,834 --> 01:03:37,037
[SPEAKER_05]: And that day, the Sunday, that everyone was just in there painting.

700
01:03:37,277 --> 01:03:41,580
[SPEAKER_05]: And when everyone came in, it was like, wow.

701
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:42,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was just...

702
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:45,517
[SPEAKER_05]: blue and white paint.

703
01:03:46,558 --> 01:03:55,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just lifted the lobby because the lobby felt, I don't know, you know, there wasn't enough lighting and it felt dark.

704
01:03:55,126 --> 01:04:00,511
[SPEAKER_05]: So just by adding, you know, our colors to the inside, it made a difference.

705
01:04:01,191 --> 01:04:07,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do think putting some of the shrubbery, getting signage up, you know,

706
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:13,645
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can have it done by our students, our students would take greater ownership.

707
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:23,401
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure, we'd have to speak specifically with Mr. Fallon about do we have the right equipment to be able to.

708
01:04:24,262 --> 01:04:25,443
[SPEAKER_05]: make the letters ourselves.

709
01:04:25,743 --> 01:04:27,384
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have the 3D machines.

710
01:04:28,084 --> 01:04:43,054
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a lot of equipment there that if we could do it ourselves, maybe, you know, I don't know what size, you know, those letters would cost, but if it's something that we could do in-house, it might not be as expensive as we think it, you know, might be.

711
01:04:43,994 --> 01:04:57,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would at least lift the front entrance while the vision committee is continuing to work and to be able to say, okay, we want this building to be compliant.

712
01:04:58,578 --> 01:05:02,319
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that would be my, and I think it would be a good use of the money.

713
01:05:02,419 --> 01:05:07,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I think especially this past year, the pandemic has wiped all of us out.

714
01:05:08,201 --> 01:05:11,602
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see the high school complex have a facelift.

715
01:05:12,862 --> 01:05:20,003
[SPEAKER_05]: even if it's just a HGTV version of a facelift, but just to lift the high school.

716
01:05:20,023 --> 01:05:41,427
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think kids walking into the building will feel proud, happy, the same way they were really happy and excited when they saw the inside lobby as a temporary measure until we're able to really figure out what are the huge projects that we're gonna end up doing to renovate the high school complex.

717
01:05:42,979 --> 01:05:43,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

718
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:44,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

719
01:05:44,479 --> 01:05:44,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Vandeku?

720
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:45,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

721
01:05:46,220 --> 01:06:09,805
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like to make a motion that we ask central administration to explore the costs by talking to Mr. Fallon and other people who might have some expertise in this area to how much it would be to pursue the concept of Mr. Dunovan, which we see as it's a,

722
01:06:10,525 --> 01:06:11,906
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's not a whole redo.

723
01:06:12,066 --> 01:06:13,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm getting off here.

724
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:17,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I should just make that, you know, but how much that would cost.

725
01:06:17,449 --> 01:06:23,432
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, I'd like to also ask that we explore the idea of the banner in the front.

726
01:06:23,832 --> 01:06:27,494
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see them as mutually, you know, one or the other.

727
01:06:27,554 --> 01:06:29,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I think both have great potential.

728
01:06:30,316 --> 01:06:37,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I really love marking the door with a little bit more excitement, and I love having a canvas, especially if we have our students input

729
01:06:37,700 --> 01:06:41,842
[SPEAKER_06]: into what sort of things we might include on that, how to make it bright.

730
01:06:42,602 --> 01:06:46,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd love to know what the costs are associated with that.

731
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:49,664
[SPEAKER_06]: So Peter, if you would, you might give direction to that.

732
01:06:50,405 --> 01:07:02,129
[SPEAKER_06]: To make my resolution more compact, that we explore the costs of the front entranceway and possibly a banner for the front side of the building.

733
01:07:07,347 --> 01:07:08,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I second that motion.

734
01:07:09,729 --> 01:07:10,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call vote.

735
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:12,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Russo?

736
01:07:13,833 --> 01:07:14,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

737
01:07:14,954 --> 01:07:15,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

738
01:07:15,154 --> 01:07:15,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Van der Kloot?

739
01:07:15,935 --> 01:07:16,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

740
01:07:17,196 --> 01:07:17,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

741
01:07:17,376 --> 01:07:17,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Kreatz?

742
01:07:17,856 --> 01:07:18,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

743
01:07:19,197 --> 01:07:20,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Three in favor.

744
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:21,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

745
01:07:24,018 --> 01:07:25,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.

746
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:37,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the next part of it is just very briefly is just doing some beautification in landscaping, Mr. McLaughlin I know it's going to be spring soon and you know hopefully we're going to see all the snows, starting to melt.

747
01:07:39,774 --> 01:08:03,900
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, could you hire a landscaper to maybe help us, you know, get some nice shrubbery that doesn't require a lot of maintenance, that will look nice, that's, you know, not going to be blocking anything at the front front where you come up, you know, from from Winthrop Street, you know, right there in that little corner where the, you know, the monument is, and then right at the front entrance.

748
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:09,341
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, where it's like we're going into spring, this is something that we would be doing, you know, anyways.

749
01:08:09,961 --> 01:08:19,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I, you know, I wanted to make a motion that we, um, do some landscaping and some, you know, shrubbery in, yes, Mr. McLaughlin.

750
01:08:19,748 --> 01:08:24,251
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may, over the years, we spent thousands of dollars down there on that corner.

751
01:08:24,271 --> 01:08:29,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the, the biggest problem is, is there's no irrigation down there.

752
01:08:30,075 --> 01:08:30,656
[SPEAKER_09]: So every,

753
01:08:31,502 --> 01:08:40,705
[SPEAKER_09]: few years I've spent three, four, five, they've put annuals in, they've put, you know, but it just, the snow gets piled up there in the winter.

754
01:08:41,065 --> 01:08:43,405
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just been kind of an Achilles heel.

755
01:08:43,805 --> 01:08:48,647
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I'll do whatever the committee wants or whatever the superintendent wants me to do.

756
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:49,627
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a problem.

757
01:08:49,707 --> 01:08:56,129
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want, you know, I just want you to be aware of that, that we've spent lots and lots and lots of money down there over the years.

758
01:08:59,490 --> 01:08:59,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

759
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:02,281
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Murphy.

760
01:09:02,441 --> 01:09:03,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mr. Murphy.

761
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:03,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

762
01:09:03,702 --> 01:09:07,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. I think to sort of add on to Mr. McLaughlin's point.

763
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:08,345
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we are.

764
01:09:08,365 --> 01:09:10,106
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want.

765
01:09:10,587 --> 01:09:15,831
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope my comments are not interpreted to suggest that I don't think this is important or that there are things that we can do.

766
01:09:16,271 --> 01:09:17,212
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect that there are.

767
01:09:17,272 --> 01:09:20,334
[SPEAKER_00]: We should we should examine them and do whatever we can.

768
01:09:20,354 --> 01:09:25,798
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's particularly important as we hopefully increase the number of students who are coming into in-person learning.

769
01:09:26,249 --> 01:09:35,455
[SPEAKER_00]: for the remainder of the school year, I think the more aesthetically pleasing we can make the building and the more vibrant we can make it, I think the better that is for culture and morale and whatnot.

770
01:09:35,955 --> 01:09:45,021
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I feel I do have a responsibility to note the non-emergency spending freeze that the administration has imposed on all of our various departments.

771
01:09:45,081 --> 01:09:55,008
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think whatever we do will have to be looked at in that context so that whatever investments we make, we can do so without causing disruption to the close of the fiscal year.

772
01:09:55,928 --> 01:09:57,749
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say that we can't do something.

773
01:09:57,769 --> 01:10:12,198
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I would be hesitant to over commit or represent to the committee that we think we can do things that it may turn out when we actually look at it more closely, that we have to downsize in order to stay within the fiscal restraints that we currently have at this point in the fiscal year.

774
01:10:13,899 --> 01:10:14,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

775
01:10:15,615 --> 01:10:16,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathy, we need to move on.

776
01:10:17,276 --> 01:10:17,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do.

777
01:10:18,357 --> 01:10:21,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so if you could take it under advisement.

778
01:10:21,478 --> 01:10:22,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

779
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:24,220
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take a look at it and we'll work on that.

780
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:25,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, take it under advisement.

781
01:10:25,461 --> 01:10:26,401
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.

782
01:10:26,882 --> 01:10:30,624
[SPEAKER_02]: And so John McLaughlin, you're up with the speed signs.

783
01:10:30,704 --> 01:10:31,524
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very brief.

784
01:10:31,704 --> 01:10:32,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they arrive?

785
01:10:33,005 --> 01:10:34,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us when they will be installed?

786
01:10:35,226 --> 01:10:35,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

787
01:10:36,607 --> 01:11:01,049
[SPEAKER_09]: uh solace the solar speed signs they did arrive they arrived around mid-december which ground was frozen the dpw has the signs in their possession uh i'm going to double check we're going to put two up mefford high school one on the vocational sign what side one out front and then we were intended on putting one in between the mcglenn in the andrews complex is that correct

788
01:11:02,122 --> 01:11:05,385
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I remember is, do you remember Mr. Russo, Ms.

789
01:11:05,405 --> 01:11:05,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Van de Koot?

790
01:11:06,426 --> 01:11:07,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was just in between.

791
01:11:07,928 --> 01:11:09,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, to slow everybody down.

792
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:10,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.

793
01:11:10,931 --> 01:11:17,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so what I will do is I will probably have those in within the next couple of weeks.

794
01:11:19,315 --> 01:11:21,817
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just waiting around to unfreeze a little bit.

795
01:11:22,198 --> 01:11:23,959
[SPEAKER_09]: The DP, well, I'm not waiting.

796
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:33,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Our friends as usual at DPW and the sign department graciously will be helping us install those signs.

797
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:36,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

798
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:41,807
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are moving on to the security camera updates.

799
01:11:41,867 --> 01:11:43,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Murphy, thank you for waiting.

800
01:11:44,088 --> 01:11:44,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

801
01:11:44,908 --> 01:11:45,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

802
01:11:46,229 --> 01:11:46,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

803
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:54,212
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be a quick update just to let the committee know that we did meet this week with members of the city administration who

804
01:11:54,840 --> 01:12:00,661
[SPEAKER_00]: were responsible for some of the upgrades that were put in place at City Hall with regard to security systems.

805
01:12:01,341 --> 01:12:03,581
[SPEAKER_00]: We have security systems and this building is safe.

806
01:12:03,641 --> 01:12:14,503
[SPEAKER_00]: And given that this is a public meeting, I think it's important to make that note that this is not a matter of having identified a particular vulnerability that we feel we need to address in a very urgent manner.

807
01:12:14,983 --> 01:12:24,185
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, in order to go into more of the specifics as to some of the upgrades that we would like to recommend to the committee and investments we think that would be prudent

808
01:12:25,063 --> 01:12:37,088
[SPEAKER_00]: to make, I would recommend that the next time we convene, we convene under the relevant executive session provisions so that we can speak in a more candid manner as to what we'd like to do and what we'd like to change.

809
01:12:37,168 --> 01:12:46,812
[SPEAKER_00]: But in short, we're looking at how we can improve the locks system, the alarm system, and the camera system, mostly at the high school.

810
01:12:46,872 --> 01:12:51,615
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of those pieces would also be at some of the K-8 schools as well.

811
01:12:53,362 --> 01:12:54,643
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had our first meeting.

812
01:12:54,843 --> 01:12:58,486
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a census of what the city did and where it could be applicable to us.

813
01:12:58,566 --> 01:13:01,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we'd be on a much larger scale because we have much more infrastructure.

814
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:11,637
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we'll be in a position to do some type of RFP process or solicitation of quotes in the next several weeks.

815
01:13:11,858 --> 01:13:18,223
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the point earlier about the limitation on the funding capacity and the need to articulate

816
01:13:18,735 --> 01:13:26,280
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the various strategic priorities that the committee will really need to take into account when making decisions as to how that money would be spent.

817
01:13:27,021 --> 01:13:38,048
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say this sort of collection of issues on the security front will be right alongside the generator issue that we discussed earlier, as well as the front entrance and ADA compliance issues.

818
01:13:38,869 --> 01:13:40,290
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll package those together.

819
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:45,593
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would anticipate presenting to you a list of recommended priorities that will stay within that funding capacity.

820
01:13:46,274 --> 01:13:48,035
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go from there.

821
01:13:50,085 --> 01:13:50,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Russo.

822
01:13:52,106 --> 01:13:52,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

823
01:13:52,906 --> 01:14:03,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Murphy, I mean, I don't have my schedule in front of us, but I would just hope that before an RFP goes up for anything security related, we have in fact had that meeting.

824
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:16,538
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to ask that we don't send RFPs out when we're actually ready to, but I just, the word security is a word that is used in a rather broad way.

825
01:14:17,177 --> 01:14:21,418
[SPEAKER_04]: frankly, we could call literally anything security if we're any good at that.

826
01:14:22,698 --> 01:14:37,542
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to make sure that I feel like I understand what we're doing, and I realize we can't talk about the details here, but I would just implore that the RFP not go out prior to the school committee knowing what it is we mean by security.

827
01:14:37,722 --> 01:14:38,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

828
01:14:38,342 --> 01:14:39,202
[SPEAKER_00]: That's no problem at all.

829
01:14:39,242 --> 01:14:45,004
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what I would probably recommend is that we use, it doesn't necessarily, and it probably shouldn't be March 8th,

830
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:47,361
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the upcoming school committee meetings.

831
01:14:47,401 --> 01:14:56,349
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it could be a relatively brief discussion in executive session where we can provide you with more specificity as to what it is we'd be looking to procure.

832
01:14:56,369 --> 01:15:05,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

833
01:15:05,776 --> 01:15:07,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I add one more thing?

834
01:15:07,057 --> 01:15:07,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

835
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:08,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you can.

836
01:15:08,478 --> 01:15:09,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Mr. Russo.

837
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:10,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

838
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:13,142
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think also, you know,

839
01:15:15,635 --> 01:15:25,724
[SPEAKER_04]: we need to think about a way to message on specifically on security cameras without causing any problems around security.

840
01:15:26,765 --> 01:15:36,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know I've heard from a number of people about like, Jesus, do we just keep buying hundreds of thousands of dollars of cameras every year?

841
01:15:36,233 --> 01:15:37,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, can't we buy the good ones?

842
01:15:39,036 --> 01:15:40,037
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know,

843
01:15:40,695 --> 01:15:44,418
[SPEAKER_04]: We all get those things in our Facebook feeds for the $19 cameras.

844
01:15:44,618 --> 01:15:47,761
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've ever bought one, they last for a long time.

845
01:15:48,161 --> 01:15:53,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And I recognize they aren't wired up and they don't comply with all the other things that we have requirements for.

846
01:15:53,566 --> 01:16:06,577
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that the, I have heard it enough times from the public at least that this, that we just seem to be on an endless spending binge to the tunes of hundreds of thousands of dollars on cameras.

847
01:16:07,618 --> 01:16:08,719
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not Boston.

848
01:16:09,112 --> 01:16:11,994
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we don't have hundreds of buildings.

849
01:16:13,015 --> 01:16:37,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the, whether we do some kind of messaging around the costs and the, you know, what it is these pieces of equipment go through being outdoors and, you know, some kind of a messaging to help the public understand that we, in fact, are not just, that we're not buying rubbish, because I'm pretty sure that's not the case, and that there isn't actually some better, more expensive thing we could buy that would save us money in a couple of years.

850
01:16:39,185 --> 01:16:53,893
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know how we message around this, but when the capital improvement plan was discussed last week, I believe that was discussed or brought up by somebody, maybe Member Graham brought it up.

851
01:16:54,393 --> 01:17:02,237
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just worry that there's this appearance that we are either buying it, installing it wrong or whatever.

852
01:17:03,949 --> 01:17:17,718
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe that's something for the communications group, or if you can look to see how other districts have messaged on this, and maybe we could copy that in some way.

853
01:17:18,098 --> 01:17:24,042
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also some apprehension coming from people that bring this up.

854
01:17:24,202 --> 01:17:26,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And the apprehension is, are you saying we don't have cameras at the doors?

855
01:17:27,204 --> 01:17:29,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the answer is no, we have cameras at the doors.

856
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:40,478
[SPEAKER_04]: know, if we say no, all the doors are covered, and at the same time say we need to buy all a bunch of new cameras, it starts to be like, well, which is it?

857
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:54,671
[SPEAKER_04]: So just something I would like it if you all could think about in your dramatically improving communications capacity that if we could somehow include something like that.

858
01:17:54,871 --> 01:17:55,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

859
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:56,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

860
01:17:56,773 --> 01:17:57,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any more questions?

861
01:18:02,809 --> 01:18:06,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have any more questions for Mr. Murphy or Mr. McLaughlin?

862
01:18:06,151 --> 01:18:28,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so just to, you know, I just wanna keep track of, so I think what I have here is that, you know, for the capital improvement meeting, maybe you'll put together some sort of a little package that you'll bring to go over the front entrance and the security updates and the emergency generator.

863
01:18:29,461 --> 01:18:34,262
[SPEAKER_02]: and you'll take under consideration any extra funds, some landscaping.

864
01:18:34,282 --> 01:18:54,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we do have, you know, Mr. Cushing's going to look into the banner and maybe Mr. McLaughlin and superintendent are gonna reach out to Mr. Fallon just to inquire if it's possible or not, if the vocational students could do something like that.

865
01:18:54,727 --> 01:18:55,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's it.

866
01:19:02,453 --> 01:19:17,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Just on a side note, the Mustangs that you see hanging up in the corners of a building when you come in, they were put in and made and installed and painted by vocational students, just so that just for a little historical significance on on signage at Method High.

867
01:19:18,327 --> 01:19:19,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent, thank you.

868
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:21,629
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Maurice, yes please.

869
01:19:21,749 --> 01:19:41,941
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to say that I did just quickly do a quick check-in with Mr. Fallon and he said that they do have a CNC machine that they think they could probably do some stuff so he just needs a few days to work on figuring it out but he does believe that it would be doable.

870
01:19:42,841 --> 01:19:45,643
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know the cost so once he's able to figure that out and

871
01:19:46,263 --> 01:19:58,921
[SPEAKER_05]: give us an estimate, I do think we'll be able to hopefully get that at a significant savings if we're able to use one of the pieces of equipment that we already have on hand.

872
01:19:59,858 --> 01:20:00,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's excellent.

873
01:20:00,919 --> 01:20:01,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

874
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:02,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Fallon, if you're listening.

875
01:20:04,601 --> 01:20:12,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that covers everything and we are going to end on time, even though we were getting a little late, but we are going to end on time.

876
01:20:12,626 --> 01:20:14,167
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a motion to adjourn?

877
01:20:14,728 --> 01:20:15,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn?

878
01:20:15,788 --> 01:20:16,549
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn.

879
01:20:17,169 --> 01:20:17,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

880
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:19,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

881
01:20:19,611 --> 01:20:20,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call.

882
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:20,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Russo?

883
01:20:21,892 --> 01:20:22,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

884
01:20:23,033 --> 01:20:23,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms Van der Kloot?

885
01:20:23,954 --> 01:20:24,134
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

886
01:20:25,052 --> 01:20:25,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

887
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:25,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Kreatz, yes.

888
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:31,373
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have motion three in favor of adjourning.

889
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:33,159
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're adjourning.

890
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,644
[SPEAKER_02]: It is 6.20 PM.

891
01:20:35,929 --> 01:20:37,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want everybody to have a great night.

892
01:20:37,313 --> 01:20:40,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for coming, Mr. Andreessen, Mr. Murphy.
