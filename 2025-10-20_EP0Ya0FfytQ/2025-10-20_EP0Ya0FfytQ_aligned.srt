00:00:06,247 --> 00:00:09,389
Hello everyone, and thank you for taking the time to watch this.

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,953
I am Nicole Branley, and I am running for re-election to the Medford School Committee.

3
00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:20,958
In 2023, I decided to run for school committee with the fire in me so hot I ignited the city.

4
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:25,361
That fire has not been extinguished, and in fact burns even hotter today.

5
00:00:26,542 --> 00:00:31,748
I have enormous respect for the seat I earned at City Hall and the voters in our beloved city trust me with.

6
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,794
I don't just represent the voters who cast a ballot for me, but our city as a whole.

7
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:41,720
Running a grassroots, independent candidate campaign is not easy.

8
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:47,868
It makes me proud to not only have won in 2023, but to run again this election season.

9
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:49,868
I'm not a politician.

10
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:53,569
I'm a mom who ran for office and won, and I want to do it again.

11
00:00:53,589 --> 00:01:00,311
I have held true to my 2023 campaign promises, safety, accountability, and excellence.

12
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:11,656
Safety will always be at the forefront of my campaign because when students and faculty feel safe in their environment, supported and know the correct policies and procedures for accountability, they will thrive.

13
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:14,197
Supporting our staff is imperative.

14
00:01:14,817 --> 00:01:18,518
They show up every single day and are the backbone of Medford Public Schools.

15
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,139
They want to be heard.

16
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,421
They want their needs met so they can meet the needs of our children.

17
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:25,963
We all own a part in that.

18
00:01:26,364 --> 00:01:32,372
Whether you have a child in Memphis Public Schools or not, what happens in our schools spills into our neighborhoods and our community.

19
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:36,097
The children are our future and they need to matter to us all.

20
00:01:37,178 --> 00:01:41,264
When staff and students feel supported, I truly believe pride and excellence follows.

21
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:52,512
Mustang pride runs deep in my Mustang blue and white veins, and my unwavering dedication to our schools, our community as a whole, has only grown deeper during my time in office.

22
00:01:53,432 --> 00:01:55,153
My whole heart is in everything that I do.

23
00:01:55,173 --> 00:01:58,736
I know it's said the school committee is a part-time job,

24
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:02,980
And what you see in Chambers is a small clip of my life as an elected official.

25
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:17,534
This job is 24-7, from reading policies and contracts, prepping for meetings, emails, phone calls, text, chatting with everyone and anyone that deserved to be heard, attending events throughout their city.

26
00:02:18,414 --> 00:02:20,356
I show up, and I will continue to do that.

27
00:02:21,337 --> 00:02:24,099
Nothing tested my heart more than budget season last year.

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:36,128
I truly felt I used my voice to stand up for our staff and our students, to ask the hard questions and dig deep to look for answers as to how and why we needed to ask all our residents to invest more into Medford.

29
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:42,793
It proved we needed to work together for solutions, listen, be clear in our goals and needs, and follow through.

30
00:02:43,513 --> 00:02:44,874
It's okay to listen and disagree.

31
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:46,276
Let's learn from each other.

32
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:47,617
Let's meet in the middle.

33
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:48,658
Compromise.

34
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:49,358
Be kind.

35
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,584
We need to lead by example for the children and families who are entrusting us with our elected positions.

36
00:02:56,584 --> 00:03:02,530
I have learned an enormous amount about our district's inner workings, laws, motions, bills, payroll,

37
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,791
Contracts, grievances, curriculum, etc.

38
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:13,195
I truly love watching my colleagues and I digest all the information at hand, break it down, bounce ideas off one another.

39
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:15,416
Believe it or not, we don't always disagree.

40
00:03:16,377 --> 00:03:20,799
So much has tested us as a district, but I'm grateful for all of it, and I yearn for more.

41
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:24,760
I have never walked into City Hall for myself, but for our city.

42
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,101
I have worked in public education for nearly a decade.

43
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:33,562
My six years as a kindergarten aide allowed me a rewarding first-hand experience in the classroom.

44
00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:44,765
My role as an administrative assistant for Somerville Public Schools Special Education Department, working for our most vulnerable students, is yet another layer in my work in public education.

45
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:54,310
I say all the time that no one job in public education is more important than the other, because at the end of the day, every one of us is working towards a student's success.

46
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,291
And you can make a difference too.

47
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:57,892
Your one vote matters.

48
00:03:58,432 --> 00:03:59,533
I can't do this without you.

49
00:03:59,993 --> 00:04:03,395
Your support through the years has made the difference to me, to my family.

50
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:06,097
So many people ask, what can I do to help?

51
00:04:06,657 --> 00:04:10,580
And if you know me at all, you know I answered kind, but direct, and with a list.

52
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,281
Host a lawn sign.

53
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,202
Share my website on your social media.

54
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:17,733
Talk to your neighbors about the candidates you support and the why.

55
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:18,957
Donate.

56
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:22,329
Hold a sign at a polling place on election day or at a standout.

57
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,463
Show up and vote for independent thinking candidates on November 4th.

58
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:27,206
Thank you.
